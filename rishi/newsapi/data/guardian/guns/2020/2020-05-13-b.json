The decision by the Russian watchdog could affect hundreds of ventilators that have been produced since April as Russian hospitals sought new supplies to prepare for a flood of coronavirus cases. </p> \n  <p>Five coronavirus patients, some reportedly attached to ventilators, died in the early hours of Tuesday after a fire broke out at the St George hospital in St Petersburg. A fire last week at a Moscow hospital treating coronavirus patients also killed one person. That fire may also have been tied to a faulty ventilator. Both hospitals were reportedly using Aventa-M ventilators produced by a state-run factory in Russia\u2019s Urals region. </p> \n  <p>An April tender showed that last month the St George hospital had ordered 237 ventilators from the factory, which is the only manufacturer of that ventilator in the country. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebbbe068f08d99d46a15f24\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/emmanuel-akinwotu\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T09:34:56.619Z\">10.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The continuing ban on public and religious gatherings in Nigeria has led to increasingly divided reactions from Churches in Nigeria. </p> \n  <p>In recent weeks, two of the most influential mega-church pastors in the country have grown in hostility to the government\u2019s lockdown measures, and questioned the severity of the pandemic altogether.</p> \n  <p>Bishop David Oyedepo, the founder of Living Faith Tabernacle has been among the most ardent critics of the ban on places of worship. Its main branch on the outskirts of Lagos draws 50,000 people. Earlier this week Oyedepo said the closure of churches while hospitals and markets were open amounted to a conspiracy against Churches. <br><br>\u201cThere is something wrong; for people to be allowed to be in the market for six hours and can\u2019t be in church for two hours. I can smell a rat,\u201d he said this week. \u201cThe voice of darkness is influencing people at various levels, targeting the church because the growth and expansion of the church is the greatest headache of the devil. I declare churches open.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Pastor Chris Oyakhilome\u2019s Christ Embassy is spread around the world with a main branch in Lagos seating 30,000 people. The pastor has been a consistent critic of measures to tackle the pandemic. \u201cThe lockdown is not science,\u201d he said in a sermon on Tuesday. The wearing of facemasks in public was \u201can embarrassment to science\u201d, he added. He has also previously linked Covid-19 to 5G mobile phone networks, fuelling a conspiracy theory that has spread around the world.</p> \n  <p>Both church leaders have faced criticism for their comments, not least from fellow church pastors. Pastor Tunde Bakare, the head of The Citadel Global Community Church, where the main hall in Lagos seats 5,000, this week donated two church buildings and a private residence to Nigerian states for isolation centres. </p> \n  <p>\u201cChurches with multiple facilities, rather than their leaders criticising the government should collaborate with them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey must be prepared to offer some of their halls to the government as isolation centres, in support of the efforts of the government.\u201d<br><br>In a further boost to Nigeria\u2019s Covid-19 response, the Catholic Church in Nigeria this week donated all of its 425 medical facilities across the country to the government to serve as isolation and treatment centres. Nigeria\u2019s predominantly deeply religious population is evenly split between Christians and Muslims according to government surveys. </p> \n  <p>The effect of the lockdown on religious life has been immense. Yet many Nigerian Christians are increasingly calling on the country\u2019s mega churches to donate their now empty auditoriums as the country rushes to build its health capacity. New infections of Covid-19 in Nigeria are growing, now at 4,787, doubling in the last 12 days. 158 people have lost their lives and 959 people have recovered. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebbba898f08d99d46a15ef8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T09:15:35.176Z\">10.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Reuters have filed this update from Poland:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Poland will extend its strict border controls until 12 June due to the coronavirus pandemic, its Interior Ministry said on Wednesday.</p> \n   <p>Poland closed its borders to foreigners in March to stop the spread of the coronavirus and has extended the restriction four times since then.

Call it the Screen New Deal. Far more hi-tech than anything we have seen during previous disasters, the future that is being rushed into being as the bodies still pile up treats our past weeks of physical isolation not as a painful necessity to save lives, but as a living laboratory for a permanent \u2013 and highly profitable \u2013 no-touch future.</p> \n  <p>This is a future in which, for the privileged, almost everything is home delivered, either virtually via streaming and cloud technology, or physically via driverless vehicle or drone, then screen \u201cshared\u201d on a mediated platform. It\u2019s a future that employs far fewer teachers, doctors and drivers. It accepts no cash or credit cards (under guise of virus control), and has skeletal mass transit and far less live art. It\u2019s a future that claims to be run on \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d, but is actually held together by tens of millions of anonymous workers tucked away in warehouses, data centres, content-moderation mills, electronic sweatshops, lithium mines, industrial farms, meat-processing plants and prisons, where they are left unprotected from disease and hyper-exploitation. It\u2019s a future in which our every move, our every word, our every relationship is trackable, traceable and data-mineable by unprecedented collaborations between government and tech giants.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/may/13/naomi-klein-how-big-tech-plans-to-profit-from-coronavirus-pandemic\">Naomi Klein: How big tech plans to profit from the pandemic</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebb75ce8f08a55ecde58e3c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T05:00:58.509Z\">6.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Nature is healing in San Jose, California: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan/status/1260410385452187649\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">oh my goat <a href=\"https://t.co/bvcaMIAHgz\">https://t.co/bvcaMIAHgz</a></p>\u2014 Helen Sullivan (@helenrsullivan) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan/status/1260410385452187649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 13, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebb7d148f08a55ecde58e5e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T04:54:56.152Z\">5.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Thailand has recorded zero new coronavirus cases for the first time since 9 March, Rueters reports. </p> \n  <p>Thailand has 3,017 confirmed cases and<strong> </strong>56 deaths, according to <a href=\"https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University</a> data. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a27ed82876dc5e0d74d4027305f041ef8a0eb5a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a27ed82876dc5e0d74d4027305f041ef8a0eb5a/0_237_5296_3176/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Street food sellers stand behind plastic divider sheet in Bangkok, Thailand, Wednesday, 13 May 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Street food sellers stand behind plastic divider sheet in Bangkok, Thailand, Wednesday, 13 May 2020.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gemunu Amarasinghe/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebb76a68f08d99d46a15d56\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T04:45:47.425Z\">5.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Confirmed deaths worldwide pass 290,000. </strong>According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 4,261,955 people around the world are known to have contracted the virus, while at least 291,964 have died since the pandemic began.<strong> </strong>The numbers, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to be significant underestimates due to suspected underreporting and differing recording and testing regimes.</li> \n   <li><strong>More than 147,000 Americans could die by early August \u2013 study. </strong>A newly revised coronavirus mortality model predicts more than 147,000 Americans will die from Covid-19 by early August, up nearly 10,000 from the last projection, as restrictions for curbing the pandemic are increasingly relaxed, researchers said on Tuesday. The current US death toll stands at 82,376.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil reports record deaths. </strong>Brazil reported a record <a href=\"https://covid.saude.gov.br/\">881 Covid-19</a> deaths in 24 hours on Tuesday, its health ministry said, taking its total to 12,400 and making it the world\u2019s sixth worst-affected country in terms of deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">figures</a>. Its total of 177,589 confirmed cases is the world\u2019s seventh-highest.</li> \n   <li><strong>US Senate threatens sanctions on China over Covid-19 accounting. </strong>US Republican senators proposed legislation Tuesday that would empower President Donald Trump to slap sanctions on China if Beijing does not give a \u201cfull accounting\u201d for the coronavirus outbreak. The legislation will give Trump 60 days to certify to Congress that China has provided a full accounting on the Covid-19 outbreak to an investigation that could be led by the United States and its allies, or a United Nations body like the World Health Organization.</li> \n   <li><strong>Wuhan prepares to test 11 million residents. </strong>The Chinese city of Wuhan, the original centre of the pandemic, plans to test all 11 million residents for coronavirus, according to local media. It was widely believed that this will be done within 10 days. However, Chinese media reports have given some more clarity today, suggesting that while there is a citywide testing plan, the time limit is for each region on staggered start times.</li> \n   <li><strong>Twitter announces employees will be allowed to work from home \u2018forever\u2019. </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/12/twitter-coronavirus-covid19-work-from-home\">Twitter will allow its employees to work from home \u201cforever\u201d</a>, chief executive officer Jack Dorsey said in a company-wide email Tuesday.

accounting\u201d for the coronavirus outbreak, AFP reports. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe Chinese Communist Party must be held accountable for the detrimental role they played in this pandemic,\u201d said Senator Jim Inhofe, one of the sponsors of the \u201cCovid-19 Accountability Act.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cTheir outright deception of the origin and spread of the virus cost the world valuable time and lives as it began to spread,\u201d he said in a statement.</p> \n  <p>The legislation will give Trump 60 days to certify to Congress that China has provided a full accounting on the Covid-19 outbreak to an investigation that could be led by the United States and its allies, or a United Nations body like the World Health Organization.</p> \n  <p>Trump must also certify that China has closed its highest-risk wet markets and released Hong Kong activists arrested in post-Covid-19 crackdowns.</p> \n  <p>Without certification, Trump would be authorised under the legislation to impose sanctions like asset freezes, travel bans and visa revocations, as well as restricting Chinese businesses\u2019 access to US bank financing and capital markets.</p> \n  <p>\u201cChina refuses to allow the international community to go into the Wuhan lab to investigate,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, another sponsor of the bill.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThey refuse to allow investigators to study how this

We swap war stories and dish on the actors who were nice to work with, gasping at the divas.

  "<p>Do not feel guilty if you neglect your freezer. It happens to the best of us. \u201cI don\u2019t think I cleaned ours at home in a year until lockdown,\u201d confesses Nina Matsunaga, the chef-owner at the Black Bull Inn in Sedbergh, Cumbria. \u201cWe do our work freezer every couple of days.\u201d</p> <p>Like Matsunaga, many of us are looking anew at our freezers. Covid-19 has concentrated minds on saving money, minimising waste and shopping less frequently. People are storing more, collectively, and after a 30% spike in the month before lockdown, frozen food sales have continued to rise, according to the British Frozen Food Federation.</p> <p>You can work productively with whatever you have, from giant chest freezers to single compartments in small fridges. All sub-zero space is useful. But how many of us know how best to utilise what in her book <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-ice-kitchen-9780008385118.html\">The Ice Kitchen</a> Shivi Ramoutar describes as an \u201cunfashionable\u201d preservation method? What freezes well? What doesn\u2019t? How do you manage those icy depths? We asked the experts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"822a473f374d2d139df11102a9bf9604138876f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/822a473f374d2d139df11102a9bf9604138876f6/95_0_2790_1676/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Don\u2019t freeze berries in blocks or they will go soggy when defrosted.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Don\u2019t freeze berries in blocks or they will go soggy when defrosted.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: igorsm8/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Is there a broad rule when choosing what (not) to freeze?</strong></h2> <p>Freezing produces structurally damaging ice-crystals. Slow freezing produces bigger crystals. Therefore, \u201cdrier\u201d ingredients freeze best. Peas thrive at -18C, while berry fruits turn to mush as they defrost. If you are making jam that is fine but freezing can ruin less flexible foods.</p> <p>For instance, the Michelin-starred chef Tom Kerridge, owner of the Butcher\u2019s Tap butcher in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, warns against freezing prime cuts \u2013 even high-grade, dry-aged beef \u2013 and particularly cheaper, watery steaks: \u201cThe muscle fibres get stretched and when it defrosts water comes out and that steak\u2019s juiciness becomes insipid. You\u2019ve broken its body.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>How do you protect food in that icy environment?</strong></h2> <p>Exposed to freezing air, loosely wrapped foods become dry, icy and corroded \u2013 so-called \u201cfreezer burn\u201d. To avoid that, place food in reusable silicone pouches or heavy plastic food bags, push as much air out as you can, and seal. Freeze each pack laid flat at first to minimise ice crystals. \u201cFlat surface areas freeze quicker,\u201d says Dan McGeorge, the head chef at Rothay Manor, Cumbria, which also allows you to arrange your freezer like a filing cabinet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d984d75859e4a52d606ebbff72949a9f9635f6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d984d75859e4a52d606ebbff72949a9f9635f6f/0_2163_4912_2944/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Food should be packed and sealed with as much air removed as possible to avoid freezer burn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Food should be packed and sealed with as much air removed as possible to avoid freezer burn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: jon11/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Sorry, filing cabinet?</strong></h2> <p>We tend to dump stuff in freezers where it sits for years, unlabelled and unidentifiable. Avoid that by labelling your flattish packs of rice, soups, sauces, shredded meat, chopped vegetables etc top right and storing them upright in a freezer drawer like files, rotating the oldest to the front. \u201cYou just riffle through to find the right pack and pull it out,\u201d says Lulu Grimes, the managing editor of BBC Good Food.</p> <p>Ramoutar\u2019s labels include the date the food was frozen (her general rule is to use everything within three to six months) and: \u201cHow I reheat it, so H for hob, O for oven, a temperature and time.\u201d You can buy special freezer labels, but paper, pen and sticky tape works. Avoid washable markers that rub off easily.</p> <p>Tip! From bacon rashers to egg whites, portion food into identifiable, user-friendly quantities. \u201cDon\u2019t freeze berries, sausages or meatballs in blocks,\u201d advises Si Toft, the chef-owner at the the Dining Room in Abersoch, Gwynedd. \u201cLay them on greaseproof paper, freeze for two hours, then bag them and take out individual handfuls.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Is there anything you should never freeze?</strong></h2> <p>Very little gets a flat no. Defrosted boiled eggs and raw potatoes are grim, however, and raw egg yolks go rubbery. \u201cWhisk them slightly and add a stabiliser \u2013 salt or sugar, depending on what you\u2019re doing with them,\u201d suggests Ramoutar.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hard, mature cheeses and firm blues freeze better \u2013 they are fine in a toastie</p> <footer> <cite>Dan Bliss</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Generally, this is a question of preparation and end use. Can you be bothered to protect a food\u2019s textural integrity and will that matter?<em> </em>Deseeded, salted, sliced, rinsed, dried and frozen cucumber makes lovely crunchy batons for dips, but that is a lot of graft. Conversely, soft herbs that turn into dark mulch as they defrost taste fine in soups and sauces \u2013 as do finely chopped vegetables. Large pieces of raw vegetable become spongy in the freezer, which will not enhance your Sunday roast. Cook before freezing for a better result.</p> <p>Broadly, if you are going to blitz it later, if you just need the flavour and not the mouthfeel, you can freeze anything. But blanching soft herbs and vegetables \u2013 submerge briefly in boiling water, plunge them into ice, dry them thoroughly \u2013 helps to retain colour and flavour.</p> <h2><strong>Can you freeze milk and cheese?</strong></h2> <p>Milk, yes. Cheese is complicated. \u201cI don\u2019t recommend it,\u201d says Dan Bliss of the cheesemonger Paxton &amp; Whitfield. \u201cThe moisture and fat splits. Defrosted cheese has a weird texture. But avoiding food waste is close to my heart. Hard, mature cheeses and firm blues freeze better \u2013 they are fine in a toastie, and you get amazing pockets of molten cheese in scones when you add grated frozen cheese to the mix. With soft cheeses, make lasagne or sauces and freeze those.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>What is the problem with fish?</strong></h2> <p>Historically, \u201cfresh\u201d fish was regularly frozen at sea and defrosted for sale, which meant you could not freeze it at home without cooking it first (on the basis that you should not refreeze defrosted food). That is no longer always true. Ask your fishmonger for guidance or check the label, which may explain: \u201cThis product was previously frozen and has been restored to chill temperature under carefully controlled conditions. It is still suitable for home freezing.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I freeze whole spices to keep them fresh: tamarind paste, curry leaves, blitzed ginger, garlic and whole fresh turmeric</p> <footer> <cite>Sumayya Usmani</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ideally, freeze whole fish or skin-on fillets. Brining the fillets (10% salt solution, 20-40 minutes), helps to firm up the delicate flesh. Thoroughly dry the fish, and wrap it in a moisture-absorbing cloth and lots of clingfilm. \u201cWhen you think you\u2019ve got enough, double it. The secret is knowing it\u2019s covered,\u201d says the chef John Molnar, owner of the Cod\u2019s Scallops fishmongers and chip shops in Nottingham.</p> <p>Molnar dislikes freezing seafood \u2013 although, interestingly, freezing helps to tenderise fresh squid and octopus \u2013 but, carefully separated and wrapped, scallops work well: \u201cStacked like a packet of Rolos.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Do you really need fresh herbs and spices?</strong></h2> <p>If you want them to look great, yes. If you just need flavour, no. Soft herbs can be blitzed and frozen in cream or oil, and you don\u2019t need to carry a vast array of fresh spices to make curry. \u201cI freeze whole spices to keep them fresh: tamarind paste, curry leaves, blitzed ginger, garlic and whole fresh turmeric, which I grate when needed,\u201d says Sumayya Usmani, a Pakistani food expert and owner of Glasgow\u2019s Kaleyard Cook School.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63c33ce3e2a3a025967c606244697f46b4a76245\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63c33ce3e2a3a025967c606244697f46b4a76245/0_510_4479_2687/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spices and herbs can be frozen so they stay fresh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spices and herbs can be frozen so they stay fresh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Natikka/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Can a freezer fast-forward my cooking?</strong></h2> <p>In endless ways, from using cooked frozen rice in stir-fries (undercook it by 20%, make sure you cool it quickly, freeze) to making soup in minutes from frozen spinach. Freezing flavoured butters (chipotle, jerk, sriracha, lime and chilli), is a simple flavour-boosting shortcut, while Matsunaga\u2019s freezer contains various raw doughs, fresh yeast (\u201cUse it straight from the freezer\u201d) and even parathas cooked in a dry pan. \u201cThey are fantastic defrosted and fried in ghee or butter \u2013 like a fresh batch.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e3eb66ec4b7fbdd5b590f5da4cf8d5de2d709a84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3eb66ec4b7fbdd5b590f5da4cf8d5de2d709a84/0_844_3645_4557/800.jpg\" alt=\"Coconut yogurt can be whizzed up with chocolate, peanut butter and bananas and turned into ice-cream, as they do at Chick \u2018n\u2019 Sours restaurants, London.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coconut yogurt can be whizzed up with chocolate, peanut butter and bananas and turned into ice-cream, as they do at Chick \u2018n\u2019 Sours restaurants, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nina Firsova/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ramoutar makes no-cook, soft-set freezer jam (\u201cBlitz fruit, sugar and a little citrus and pop it in\u201d) and Carl Clarke, the chef-founder at Chick \u2018n\u2019 Sours, London, creates instant ice-cream by freezing, for example, bananas, dark chocolate, peanut butter and coconut yoghurt and combining them in a powerful, Nutribullet-style blender.</p> <h2><strong>If not prime cuts, can we freeze any meat?</strong></h2> <p>\u201cProfessionally, I\u2019m not keen,\u201d says Kerridge. Indeed, most chefs use the freezer as a tool for meat rather than for storage. If you want perfectly cubed pancetta or incredibly thin beef for carpaccio, firm the meat by freezing it for 30 minutes, then slice it. James Cochran, the head chef at 12:51 restaurant in London, uses a Microplane to grate frozen beef on to poached eggs (\u201clike fancy tartare\u201d) and bone marrow into mash, \u201clike parmesan, to add umami\u201d.</p> <p>Kerridge is more open to freezing meat at home \u2013 \u201ccured meats work fine\u201d \u2013 and in braises, curries or stews, where the sauce is the main flavour, it will be impossible to detect if the beef shin, ham hock or chicken breasts used were frozen. \u201cPacket chicken breasts are just protein which takes on the flavour of whatever they are cooked in,\u201d he says.</p> <h2><strong>Is the freezer a baker\u2019s secret weapon?</strong></h2> <p>It certainly lends itself to cool hacks (sorry). Chilling layers of a celebration cake makes them less fragile as you trim and level them, but also, says Rachel Stockley, the head chef at Baratxuri in Ramsbottom, Bury, if you freeze the icing as you complete each layer it produces a smooth, hard finish, so the cake \u201csits in those even layers the pros get\u201d. After glazing sausage rolls and pies, Andy Waugh, of Mac and Wild, London, freezes them for 30 minutes and repeats that before cooking: \u201cIt gives you an extra-lush finish.\u201d The freezer will even save wedges of dry fruit cake, advises Scott Paton, the head chef at Boringdon Hall, Devon: \u201cThe fruit plumps up and makes the cake moist.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>A pregnant healthcare assistant is mounting a legal action against NHS Professionals, an employment agency owned by the Department of Health and Social Care, in what could be a landmark action for other vulnerable workers bearing the brunt of the lockdown.</p> <p>The mother of two, who has worked for six years at a London hospital on an agency contract, says she was sent home during the pandemic for safety reasons and has been without work or pay for eight weeks in what her lawyers say is a breach of the UK\u2019s Employment Rights Act. She was instead advised to apply for universal credit.</p> <p>The case exemplifies some workers\u2019 experiences, with some employers and agencies ignoring health and safety legal protections for pregnant women, according to the charity Maternity Action, which is supporting the woman.</p> <p>Andrew Hillier QC, a pro bono adviser at the South West London Law Centre, which is working for the healthcare assistant, said: \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable that NHS Professionals, a key provider of staff to the NHS, is grossly abusing the concept of zero-hours contracts \u2013 and that experienced, committed healthcare professionals like \u2018Ms A\u2019 are suffering because of it.\u201d</p> <p>The case comes as other frightened workers who are isolating, either to protect themselves or loved ones with underlying health conditions, have spoken of coming under pressure to return to work, in some cases at public bodies.</p> <p>On the day when the government\u2019s easing of lockdown began, and increasing numbers of workers braved public transport, unions highlighted cases of key workers threatened with the sack or being put on unpaid leave.</p> <p>The warning came as the takeaway firm Deliveroo was accused by a cross-party grouping of MPs of \u201cputting thousands of people at risk\u201d with its alleged treatment of its riders during the lockdown.</p> <p>Forty-four MPs, from the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, to the father of the Commons, the Tory MP Sir Peter Bottomley, wrote to the gig economy company to demand adequate PPE and full pay for riders contracting the virus or self-isolating with symptoms, and an end to dismissals during the crisis.</p> <p>\u201cDeliveroo couriers are low-paid, precarious workers, who are not able to self-isolate when sick or to protect their families, and clients and restaurant staff and other key workers including NHS staff are being potentially exposed to infection,\u201d<a href=\"http://ridersroovolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IWGB-CLB-MP-Letter-to-Deliveroo-CEO.pdf\"> they say in the letter</a>, supporting a campaign by the Independent Workers\u2019 Union of Great Britain.</p> <p>Deliveroo, which rejected the suggestion that it put profit above the safety of its riders, said: \u201cAt Deliveroo, riders are at the heart of everything we do and we are working hard to support them during this unprecedented time. This includes distributing PPE kit to riders across the UK, supporting riders financially if they are unwell, and keeping riders safe through contact-free delivery.\u201d</p> <p>Separately, employers, including councils and schools, have been accused by the Unison union of using Public Health England guidance to compel frightened staff to go to work. Those involved include a school caretaker whose wife and young child are both shielding on government advice, who has not been paid for more than a month.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWe feel like we\u2019re forgotten. I told my manager I\u2019d start early or work at the end of the day to limit my exposure to the threat of the virus, because there\u2019s little chance of social distancing in a primary school \u2013 you can\u2019t stop kids sneezing and coughing \u2013 but they said no.</p> <p>\u201cWe have no income and we\u2019re getting into debt. I\u2019m low-paid anyway, so not having any money coming in is causing massive amounts of stress and anxiety.\u201d </p> <p>In a letter to health secretary, Matt Hancock, the Unison general secretary, Dave Prentis, asked the government to extend the furlough scheme beyond private companies. \u201cThrough no fault of their own, some low-paid workers are having to choose between putting food on the table or protecting loved ones,\u201d he said. \u201cVague public health guidance is giving unscrupulous employers the wriggle room to pressure those who should really be off to go into work.\u201d</p> <p>NHS Professionals said: \u201cThe first priority of NHS Professionals is always the health, safety and welfare of all our bank members, particularly those who may be vulnerable. Unfortunately, we are unable to comment on this case, as South West London Law Centres has provided no specifics, which means we are unable to investigate.</p> <p>\u201cOur policy for where one of our bank members is unable to work either because they are shielding, because they are in their third trimester of pregnancy or they are defined by Public Health England as high risk and other work cannot be found for them, NHS Professionals are paying for pre-booked shifts and then transition to an average weekly payment based on the 12 weeks prior to them notifying us they cannot work.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Ministers faced fresh allegations on Wednesday of failing to prepare care homes for a pandemic, as it emerged that Covid-19 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/coronavirus-real-care-home-death-toll-double-official-figure-study-says\">may have killed 22,000 residents</a> in England and Wales \u2013 more than twice the official toll.</p> \n<p>Council social care directors in England warned the government two years ago, in a series of detailed reports, about care homes\u2019 exposure to a pandemic, the Guardian has learned.</p> \n<p>They called for better supply plans for personal protective equipment \u2013 warning that \u201cdemand for PPE could rapidly outstrip supply\u201d \u2013 plus improved infection control and a system to enlist volunteers to help services expected to be stretched to breaking point.</p> \n<p>The Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass), which represents directors of adult social services in England, told the Guardian it carried out the work to improve government planning for a flu pandemic at the request of the Department of Health and Social Care. But it said: \u201cWe are not aware of whether government departments picked up on any of the recommendations set out.\u201d</p> \n<p>A Department for Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cAs the public would expect, we regularly test our pandemic plans \u2013 allowing us to rapidly respond to this unprecedented crisis. Our planning helped prevent the NHS being overwhelmed and means we are past the peak of the virus.\u201d</p> \n<p>The fresh allegations come as Boris Johnson was accused of downplaying the threat to care homes as recently as March, while a study from the London School of Economics (LSE) put the death toll for care home residents in England and Wales at 22,000, more than double the official estimate.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/08/care-home-residents-harvested-left-to-die-uk-government-herd-immunity\">'Harvesting' is a terrible word \u2013&nbsp;but it's what has happened in Britain's care homes | Richard Coker</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>On a day of rising pressure over the failure better to protect the elderly and vulnerable against the coronavirus outbreak, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/13/boris-johnson-resorts-to-bluster-under-keir-starmer-cross-examination\">Keir Starmer used prime minister\u2019s questions</a> to ask why Public Health England (PHE) had advised in March that care home residents were \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to become infected by Covid-19. This was PHE\u2019s position as the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic and people were already dying in the UK.</p> \n<p>The Labour leader said the government had been \u201ctoo slow to protect people in care homes\u201d, and Johnson was forced to admit that \u201cthe number of casualties has been too high\u201d in the sector.</p> \n<p>Stamer said the final coronavirus death toll, currently standing at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-passes-40000-official-figures-say\">just over 40,000</a> in the UK, including care homes, hospitals and private homes, would be \u201cdeeply horrifying\u201d.</p> \n<p>The advice on the \u201cunlikely\u201d threat posed by Covid-19 to care homes was changed on 13 March and Downing Street said it was drawn up at a time when there were no infections in the UK. But the clash highlighted growing anger over the attention and resourcing given to preparing care homes as ministers focused on preventing the NHS from being overwhelmed.</p> \n<p>In a sign of shifting priorities, the government announced a \u00a3600m cash injection for care homes to help control infection.</p> \n<p>The report prepared by Adass for the government in 2018 followed a government pandemic planning exercise known as Cygnus, which uncovered the need to boost the capacity of care homes and staff numbers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5db220bd-91df-44be-8f21-f47c8505b40b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xAU2euHH8v0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>They stated that frontline care workers would need advice on \u201ccontrolling cross-infection\u201d and called for a system for mustering volunteers from families, charities and the community to help overwhelmed homes. They also called for new guidance on increasing stocks of PPE, with a prescient warning that \u201cdemand for PPE could rapidly outstrip supply\u201d. </p> \n<p>Care operators have struggled to limit cross-infection, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/03/the-observer-view-on-care-home-deaths-being-an-indictment-of-our-society\">outbreaks</a> killing more than two dozen residents in some facilities in the space of a few weeks. Staff absences have been running at 10% to 20% and early in the crisis the care industry complained that it was not covered by the government\u2019s NHS volunteering scheme.</p> \n<p>A survey of more than 100 care homes published on Wednesday by the Alzheimer\u2019s Society found 43% were still not confident of their PPE supply, with one home resorting to taping bags around carers\u2019 arms, feet and hair. Some 58% of homes said they were unable to isolate residents, and one-third said they had taken in Covid-positive patients discharged from hospital.</p> \n<p>The latest assessment of fatalities in care settings by LSE academics found that more than half of all \u201cexcess deaths\u201d in England and Wales \u2013 those above the five-year average for the period from 28 December to 1 May \u2013 happened in care homes. They said that from 13 March to 1 May, care homes accounted for 19,938 excess deaths.</p> \n<p>Only 8,310 of those were specifically linked to Covid-19 by the Office of National Statistics (ONS), reflecting the declarations of care homes rather than on death certificates.</p> \n<p>The researchers added that deaths of care home residents in hospitals were not currently represented in the ONS figures, and that around 15% of deaths of care home residents happened in hospitals , bringing the total to more than 22,000.</p> \n<p>The report authors, Adelina Comas-Herrera and Jos\u00e9-Luis Fern\u00e1ndez, have been tracking virus death tolls in care homes globally since the start of the pandemic. They cited concerns raised internationally about deaths being linked to the residents being isolated in their rooms, without adequate food, drink or medical support, and not to the virus itself.</p> \n<p>The ONS appeared to support their estimate, saying its data showed just under 20,000 excess deaths registered up to 1 May in care homes since the pandemic started.</p> \n<p>\u201cOf those, 8,312 have had Covid-19 mentioned on the death certificate,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cWe are undertaking further analysis on all deaths of care home residents which will be published in the coming days.\u201d</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, Downing Street confirmed that the international comparison of death rates by country had been dropped from the slide at the daily press conference, but denied that it was because of embarrassment that the UK is now shown as having the second worst toll after the US.</p>",

Milan 1-0 Barcelona (Massaro 22)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Daniele Massaro, who missed so many opportunities in last year\u2019s final, has given Milan a deserved lead! Rossi punted a huge goalkick into the night sky that fell towards Nadal. He controlled the ball on his left breast \u2013 an action that sorts the men from the boys when a leather ball is dropping out of the sky \u2013 and then lobbed a header towards Sergi. But it was a poor one that allowed Boban to nip in and acrobatically stab the loose ball towards Savicevic on the right. </p> <p>He controlled the ball delicately, flicked it over Nadal\u2019s lazy tackle in the same movement and moved ominously into the area. Guardiola got back but a touch of subtle brilliance from Savicevic allowed him to put his body between Guardiola and the ball. Zubizaretta then came out to meet Savicevic, who declined the obvious shot and lifted the ball across the six-yard box, over Koeman, with his right foot. Massaro, unmarked at the far post, stretched to steer a volley into the empty net. </p> <p>It was an unusual pass from Savicevic, and the BBC commentators aren\u2019t sure whether he meant it. As he was falling over he stunned the ball the ground so that it bounced over the head of Koeman. Had a lesser player done it, I would be confident it was a fluke. Savicevic is a genius, so let\u2019s give him the benefit of the doubt.</p> <p>The Milan players and bench are going mad, with one exception. Capello, his hands still in his pockets, purses his lips and sits back down. His body language all night has suggested he might have one or two private thoughts about Johan Cruyff\u2019s pre-match comments, not to mention the stick Milan have received all season.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09b38db0f20827e299837b69241d76ad6cb14f2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09b38db0f20827e299837b69241d76ad6cb14f2b/0_303_1802_1081/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Milan\u2019s Daniele Massaro slides the ball into the net to open the scoring.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Milan\u2019s Daniele Massaro slides the ball into the net to open the scoring.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T19:06:14.511Z\">at 8.06pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ebc3e178f08d99d46a165f6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T18:36:36.045Z\">7.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>22 min </strong>\u201cI wish we\u2019d had Laudrup v Laudrup,\u201d says Danica Christensen. \u201cWould have been a blast!

If we can prove that an offensive, technical team wins against a running team, that has to be good for football. We impose our game on the opposition, moving the ball quickly and forcing the game.

They won just as much as [Fabio] Capello\u2019s team, but the difference was the exciting, dramatic way they played, attacking constantly. It was Sacchi\u2019s side which gave Milan the prestige which they are enjoying today. As a spectator, I prefer the Milan of a few years ago.

Milan and Barcelona, Europe\u2019s two best teams, are about to meet in the Champions League final in Athens. It\u2019s the world\u2019s best defence against the world\u2019s best attack - or it would be if Milan were not without their suspended centre-backs Franco Baresi and Alessandro Costacurta. That, and the recent form of both teams, means that most pundits have an increasingly strong fancy for Barcelona tonight. </p> <p>Milan have had a strange old season. For the third year in a row they won Serie A at a canter, a heck of an achievement in Europe\u2019s strongest league. No team had won three in a row since the immortal Torino side of the 1940s. But they did a lot of it in binary \u2013 exactly half their league games finished 0-0 or 1-0 to Milan, and their level of popularity in Italy makes George Graham\u2019s Arsenal seem like England\u2019s darlings by comparison. </p> <p>Boring Boring Milan scored only 36 goals in 34 games, conceding 15. Yet they still won the title so easily that they could sleepwalk over the line. They failed to win any of their last six games and finished the domestic season with an embarrassing 1-0 defeat at home to Reggiana.</p> <p>By contrast, Barcelona produced a blistering run of form to break the hearts of all connected with Deportivo La Coruna. Johan Cruyff\u2019s team will still be high on Saturday\u2019s astonishing title victory: it was their fourth in a row, a club record, and was sealed when that tame last-minute penalty from Deportivo\u2019s Miroslav Djukic was saved by Valencia\u2019s Santiago Canizares.</p> <p>That 6-3 walloping at Real Zaragoza in mid-February was a blessing in a very humiliating disguise. Since then, Barcelona\u2019s record in La Liga and the European Cup is P20 W17 D3 L0 F59 Awho cares how many concede when you score that many.</p> <p>Milan\u2019s lack of goals is partly down to the sad absence of Marco van Basten, who hasn\u2019t played since the European Cup final defeat to Marseille a year ago. Stefano Eranio is also injured, while there are doubts about Zvonimir Boban; if he is unfit, Brian Laudrup will take his place on the right wing. </p> <p>The other Laudrup, Barcelona\u2019s Danish genius Michael, misses out because of the three-foreigner rule, as does Milan\u2019s Jean-Pierre Papin. A lot of attacking talent will be on the sidelines tonight. But it\u2019s the absence of two defenders that could prove decisive. </p> <p><strong>Kick off:</strong> 7.15pm BST on 18 May 1994, and on 13 May 2020</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T17:16:26.170Z\">at 6.16pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

  "<p>Police have recovered CCTV footage of a suspect who spat at a railway ticket office worker who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/12/uk-rail-worker-dies-coronavirus-spat-belly-mujinga\">died later of coronavirus</a>, amid fears that spitting is being used as a weapon against frontline workers.</p> <p>Belly Mujinga, 47, was allegedly spat at and coughed at on the concourse of London\u2019s Victoria station in March by a man claiming to have contracted the virus. She died of Covid-19 two weeks later in a case that has united political leaders in disgust. It comes after a series of reports that key workers across the country are increasingly being spat and coughed at by members of the public during the pandemic.</p> <p>Mujinga\u2019s employer, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), confirmed it has passed video of the incident to the British Transport Police.</p> <p>Asked whether there was a delay in handing over the CCTV, a spokeswoman for Govia said: \u201cWe have shared CCTV footage with the BTP and are supporting them with their investigation.\u201d</p> <p>CCTV now obtained by detectives contains footage of a potential suspect police want to find in relation to the alleged threatening and spitting at the railway worker who later died from coronavirus, it is understood.</p> <p>It had been feared that some of the video could have been wiped or not recorded because GTR failed to report the attack at the time. But a police investigation, that only began this week, has managed to recover at least one image of the suspect from one of the cameras.</p> <p>A witness, who did not want to be named, said the man who spat at Mujinga, and another worker who fell ill, was around 50 years old and smartly dressed. They said: \u201cThe gentlemen looked like a lawyer or something. He asked us why we weren\u2019t in the ticket office. He said: \u2018you know I have the virus\u2019. Then he spat and started coughing. We told our managers to call the police. I don\u2019t know if they did.\u201d</p> <p>British Transport Police confirmed it received a report of the attack only on Monday this week, more than a month after Mujinga died. A spokesman added: \u201cWe are still in the process of reviewing CCTV opportunities.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the transport union TSSA is calling on the government to extend the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/families-health-staff-die-coronavirus-get-60000-payouts-matt-hancock\">coronavirus compensation scheme</a> for health and care workers to the families of transport workers who lose their lives.</p> <p>The government has yet to respond to the request. Boris Johnson described Mujinga\u2019s death as \u201ctragic\u201d. Speaking during prime ministers questions he said: \u201cThe fact that she was abused for doing her job is utterly appalling.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a544d44a3f5e2df65805aab72c93f5ce70fb7ce3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a544d44a3f5e2df65805aab72c93f5ce70fb7ce3/0_98_750_450/500.jpg\" alt=\"A family photograph of Belly Mujinga with her daugher, Ingrid, issued by her sister Agnes Ntumba.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A family photograph of Belly Mujinga with her daugher Ingrid, issued by her sister Agnes Ntumba.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Family handout/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said the case was \u201cabsolutely heartbreaking\u201d, but that it was a criminal matter, not about staff having more protective equipment.</p> <p>Speaking on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme he said: \u201cNobody should be spat at, this is not a question of PPE. It\u2019s just disgusting and I know the British Transport Police are investigating.\u201d</p> <p>In a letter to Johnson, the TSSA general secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/manuel-cortes\">Manuel Cortes</a>, said: \u201cWe\u2019re writing to ask you to extend the compensation scheme to Belly Mujinga\u2019s family and to other transport workers who die from coronavirus. While we can\u2019t change what happened to Belly, we can and should do everything in our power to prevent any more deaths from this horrific virus.\u201d</p> <p>Victoria station staff have been speaking about their fear of working after the attack. A gate worker, Victor Bangura, 34, said: \u201cMy whole body went into shock. I was very, very emotional. We are all vulnerable, in the same station, it could happen to any one of us.\u201d</p> <p>Linda Freitas, who has worked at Victoria for 13 years, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think people realise how much abuse we get.

  "<p>Premiership players are poised to seek clarification over whether their 25% pay cuts will be stopped as well as what the Covid-19 testing procedures are before agreeing to return to training following approval from the government.</p> <p>The Premiership welcomed the DCMS guidelines which allow players to train individually, provided they are physically distanced, but the Rugby Football Union warned there is \u201csignificant work to do\u201d before that can happen. A decision on precisely when players can return to their clubs is expected on Thursday following a meeting between both organisations and the Rugby Players\u2019 Association.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/may/13/english-youth-rugby-obsession-size-stunts-progress\">English youth rugby's obsession with size stunts the progress of talent | Robert Kitson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The guidelines also come with a host of conditions, including clubs conducting one-on-one discussions with players, who are required to \u201copt in\u201d to returning to training. Wage cuts and concerns over testing \u2013 of which the guidelines made no mention \u2013 are expected to be raised.</p> <p>As revealed by the Guardian, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/26/wage-cut-row-intensifies-as-premiership-players-take-legal-advice\">the initial 25% wage cuts across the Premiership</a> in March were met with resistance by players, largely because clubs did not adopt a uniform approach. Some stated they would last until players came off the government\u2019s furlough scheme while others were less clear as to whether it would be until they resumed training, or until the clubs started receiving income again. Players were given legal advice to reserve their position, with claims of unlawful deduction of wages likely, and if clubs are not willing to restore players to their full wages when they are expected to return to training, it could lead to further claims.</p> <p>While clubs are expected to seek clarification, players returning to training in any capacity is highly likely to mean they no longer qualify for the government\u2019s furlough scheme. One well-placed source said: \u201cThe problem will be when the players start returning to training and start expecting to be on full wages. That\u2019s when the clubs will look at deferrals and further cuts. Discussions will happen all over again once the furlough stops.\u201d</p> <p>Even with the DCMS\u2019s approval, the Premiership\u2019s hopes of resuming the season by early July look to be dashed with the RFU seemingly insisting the move would need the union\u2019s approval, making a swift return to training unlikely. The guidelines also make it clear that the government would have to give approval before contact training can begin and urge clubs to ensure they have the necessary insurance policies in place.</p> <p>An RFU statement read: \u201cWhile much has been done in recent weeks to establish protocols around a safe return to training and ultimately competition, there is still significant work to do and discussions to be had with players and staff before any form of training can resume, their welfare will be at the heart of our decisions.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Eddie Jones has called for a reduction in the number of replacements used in rugby from eight to six in what would constitute a radical law change to the game. The England head coach, who has repeatedly predicted the rise of more versatile \u201chybrid\u201d players who can interchange between the forwards and backs, believes fewer replacements would lead to less emphasis on power.</p> <p>\u201cWith eight subs you can replace half your team in the second half, so you\u2019ve got power [as a focus],\u201d Jones told the Rugby Ruckus podcast. \u201cAll those things have built a game where it\u2019s suiting the power players \u2026 We should cut down the subs to six, which would put a different aspect on the game. So imagine that you carried three front-rows, one lock who could play back-row, one half-back and then a back-line player that can cover from 10 to 15. That would certainly make it a more fatiguing game because you wouldn\u2019t get that half a team being replaced.\u201d</p>",

Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Sir Keir Starmer was widely expected to outperform Boris Johnson at PMQs, and in their first encounter last week he duly managed to do so with aplomb. On their second outing you would have expected No 10 to have given some thought to how to mount a more effective response. But there was not much evidence of this, and Johnson was duly skittled.</p> \n  <p>One problem for Johnson was that some of the usual tactics just don\u2019t work at Zoom PMQs. A outright untruth can win you temporary reprieve in the House of Commons if 300 MPs are cheering you on and it is going to take people a while to work out that you\u2019re mistaken or lying, but Johnson does not have the wall of sound protection he used to enjoy, and denying the existence of a document that Labour were able to circulate within seconds (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/13/uk-coronavirus-live-millions-health-conditions-return-to-work-pmqs-covid-19-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5ebbdc9c8f08a55ecde591b4#block-5ebbdc9c8f08a55ecde591b4\">12.47pm)</a> was just an elementary error. Starmer is not infallible, and there are ways of beating him in an argument. But suggesting that Starmer (the archetypal \u201cswot\u201d, as the PM would put it) is wrong on a point of fact - how naive can you get?</p> \n  <p>Having exhausted denial as a tactic, Johnson (in exchanges two and three) resorted to ignoring the question. But this, again, is a less reliable tactic in a largely silent House of Commons, and Johnson\u2019s failure to be able to address the point raised by <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/05/12/governments-handling-covid-19-british-disaster/\">the Ambrose Evans-Pritchard column in the Telegraph, </a>or to be able to give a sensible explanation of the excess death figure, left him looking unimpressive. In the final three answers Johnson was on slightly less shaky ground. There is an argument for not using the global death comparisons chart (although one that\u2019s harder to make if you\u2019ve only just abandoned it now), he did at last acknowledge the childcare problem, and he promised to publish Sage advice. But his very partial recovery was too late. By then the damage was done.</p> \n  <p>Again, none of this was particularly surprising.

Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Diamond said the UK was \u201cat the higher level\u201d for coronavirus deaths in Europe, but that he was not prepared to say it had the worst record</strong>. Asked directly if the UK had the highest coronavirus death toll in Europe, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m not prepared to say that at this time. I don\u2019t think that we have very good data in the UK and I do think that there is no doubt that we are, if you like, at the higher level for deaths. I\u2019ve no problem about saying that.</p> \n   <p>Because of the great difficulty in understanding exactly whether we\u2019re comparing apples with apples, or apples with pears, I\u2019m not prepared to say that the UK has the highest.</p> \n   <p>So, for example, if we look at the comparison with Italy, the most recent adjustment made in Italy only took us up to the end of March. We are much further on ...</p> \n   <p>So there are very, very different data collection strategies in different countries. It will be some time, because of the way that other countries report, that I\u2019m able to give an authoritative answer to that question.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Diamond also explained why comparing death rates in different countries could be misleading. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Let\u2019s just start with age. We know that, above all, this is a disease which really impacts the elderly members of society. So if you population has a radically different age structure, then one needs to do something about controlling for that. Ireland, for example, has a much younger age structure than some other parts of Europe.</p> \n   <p>Secondly, we know from ONS data it\u2019s a pandemic which started in London. It takes much longer to move through rural areas. We need to know something about the degree of urbanisation, the degree to which people are living close together.</p> \n   <p>These are areas that you really need to take into account, as well as the points that we\u2019ve that we\u2019ve already talked about, which are about making sure that the recording is comparative.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The UK Statistics Authority has backed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/12/uk-coronavirus-live-sunak-expected-to-extend-furlough-scheme-as-lockdown-confusion-continues?page=with:block-5ebad4de8f08d99d46a15999#block-5ebad4de8f08d99d46a15999\">Downing Street\u2019s decision to stop publishing a daily global deaths comparison chart.</a> </strong>At the hearing<strong> </strong><strong>Ed Humpherson</strong>, director general for regulation at the authority, was giving evidence alongside Diamond and he was asked specifically about the move, which means No 10 no longer presents a daily chart showing the UK as having the worst record in Europe.

coronavirus crisis.</p> \n  <p><strong>The Association of Independent Festivals</strong> (AIF), which represents 65 festivals in the UK, including <strong>Gloucestershire\u2019s 2000trees</strong>, <strong>London\u2019s Meltdown</strong> and <strong>Sheffield\u2019s Tramlines</strong>, reports 92% of its members saying they face costs that could ruin their businesses as a result of cancelled events, with the vast majority (98.5%) not covered by insurance for cancellation related to Covid-19.</p> \n  <p>Costs include potential refunds of up to \u00a3800m for events that were due to take place this summer, and average non-recoupable costs of \u00a3375,000 per festival for overheads such as marketing, staffing and advertising. </p> \n  <p>A member survey has revealed that the sector could be facing redundancies of 59% on average and will lose more than half of its workforce between September 2020 and February 2021 without support.</p> \n  <p>The AIF chief executive, <strong>Paul Reed</strong>, says that many independent festivals aren\u2019t able to access funds through the government\u2019s coronavirus business interruption loan scheme because they are unable to meet eligibility criteria, while the bounce-back loan scheme, capped at \u00a350,000, doesn\u2019t adequately cover what they need to stay afloat without income for this year. </p> \n  <aside

One maternity hospital that had been turned into a coronavirus centre is being disinfected and returned to its original use to ensure support for pregnant women after the attack, Majrooh said.</p> <p>The attack was condemned internationally as a war crime, breaking international humanitarian law that protects health workers, hospitals and patients.</p> <p>\u201cIn the midst of a <a href=\"https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=4tNED-2FM8iDZJQyQ53jATUWO9Vykxs7I8uslulOOkqR-2FRIFQvDiryvhWGycYefDnQllh5_EIyPxD9g-2Br68ug5sqwkGGnb7EseUKywx1LvJYyKp6NGLG6e-2BvtbEDNx4CwXRDw4shgiIzC5YPIFmCFm0WJznF-2FFkx3wPhtUpc03DNtbKD6lxmNy9VEGg5Hy0e-2F-2B6cJcvzcFCyAlh-2BDDq85bCUan6uXi5fFetrRP67N5e-2FIFOwsbeqnIfEc-2B7QwMOOP521LkuTEnc0PTHFdeFAlDP5pPa-2BQQmJh-2FgfEaOml8XcwOaCxwIbwqX-2FpFkoZWqqbcvg-2FJznxH3w8WSeM0sgXcyZAzvAEChBrvmE1s8k5McNouGcA7ThrdL9SXuKQ7tOyf-2FMFJDZ0VTeQvRld0yFERR0E6hy07XzqF6gg2qtUEpU-2FX-2FX5VEdoxbnABzw8aZDdrY-2F1em\">pandemic</a>, Afghanistan needs its medical facilities more than ever,\u201d said Patricia Gossman, an associate Asia director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThose paying the price when armed groups attack medical facilities are not just the patients and medical staff but all Afghans, including children, who are denied essential care when hospitals cannot function.\u201d</p> <p>The death toll from a bomb blast at a funeral in the country\u2019s east, carried out at the same time, has risen to 32, with more than 130 people injured.</p> <p>In response to both attacks, Afghanistan\u2019s president, Ashraf Ghani, has ordered security forces on to the offensive against the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/taliban\">Taliban</a> and other militant groups, ending a period of reduced military activity. </p> <p>US-brokered peace talks had been expected to start this year but now seem unlikely to go ahead.</p>",
  "<p>There is still much to be learnt about the coronavirus, but it is clear that transmission is efficient in crowded, enclosed spaces. On that basis a full House of Commons is unsafe.</p> <p>That is why \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/13/hybrid-virtual-parliament-plans-to-be-put-to-mps-next-week\" title=\"\">hybrid scrutiny</a>\u201d was introduced, with most MPs contributing to debates remotely. It is an imperfect system but also a vital experiment in technological adaption by an institution that is slow to embrace modernity.</p> <p>So it is a shame that Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the house, wants to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/13/jacob-rees-mogg-tells-mps-to-set-example-and-return-to-commons-coronavirus\" title=\"\">bring the experiment to a close</a> at the end of this month. Mr Rees-Mogg\u2019s view is that MPs should \u201clead by example\u201d, encouraging people back to work by appearing in Westminster\u2019s most famous workplace. Regulations that permit digital participation might not be extended. MPs would be corralled back into the chamber or forfeit the ability to perform their democratic duties.</p> <p>It is true, as Mr Rees-Mogg also asserts, that constituents expect their representatives to work, but more revealing that he thinks the only way they can do so is standing on the Commons stage. That is the aspect of the job he values. Other MPs want to know whether government guidance on the return to work is coherent and responsible when the virus is still prevalent. Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, challenged Mr Rees-Mogg on that point on Wednesday.</p> <p>Parliament is more than the sum of its members. It employs many people in supporting roles. As in any workplace emerging from lockdown, there will be questions about childcare, vulnerability from underlying health problems, and the wisdom of using public transport. Government guidance encourages those who can work from home to do so and MPs have that facility.</p> <p>Hybrid scrutiny has serious flaws. The conference call is not great for challenging ministers. There is also an upside in the silencing of braying that obstructs reasonable debate and alienate audiences. It is too early to say what aspects of digitisation are successful, but it has worked well enough to prove that modernisation was overdue.</p> <p>That is one reason why Mr Rees-Mogg wants it suffocated. The leader of the house is the champion of the Conservative faction that venerates parliament as the symbolic pinnacle of British democracy, while abhorring any exercise of legislative power in opposition to their ideological demands. The hypocrisy was displayed constantly over Brexit, culminating in Mr Rees-Mogg\u2019s connivance in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/29/day-democracy-died-what-the-papers-say-about-proroguing-parliament\" title=\"\">cynical prorogation</a> that was then ruled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/24/boris-johnsons-suspension-of-parliament-unlawful-supreme-court-rules-prorogue\" title=\"\">unlawful by the</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/24/boris-johnsons-suspension-of-parliament-unlawful-supreme-court-rules-prorogue\" title=\"\">supreme</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/24/boris-johnsons-suspension-of-parliament-unlawful-supreme-court-rules-prorogue\" title=\"\">court</a>.</p> <p>It is imperative that parliament exercise its powers at full capacity during this crisis, and hybrid scrutiny is problematic. But that is not why the experiment is in peril. If the government were serious about parliamentary sovereignty, MPs would be given a vote on extending or amending the regulations in light of what has been learned. Instead, the decision to switch off the digital parliament is in the hands of the executive, regardless of the Speaker\u2019s reservations.</p> <p>The reason is not better scrutiny but public relations to serve the government \u2013 to symbolise normality returning, regardless of whether sufficient progress has been made against Covid-19. It is the prioritisation of theatre over policy and archaic ritual over reality. This is Mr Rees-Mogg\u2019s creed. It is no way to run a modern democracy.</p>",

  "<p>Britain\u2019s top police officer has said falls in gun and knife crime under lockdown are \u201csilver linings\u201d to the pandemic.</p> <p>Cressida Dick, the Met commissioner, said officers had a \u201csmile on their face\u201d as they had more time to go after criminals.</p> <p>\u201cThere are undoubtedly some silver linings,\u201d Dick said. \u201cWith people not being on the streets, [there are] less opportunities for criminality during this period. We have seen a relief from violent crime for so many people. And clearly many criminals being inhibited in their activities.\u201d</p> <p>She said the Met had been able to hunt down longtime wanted suspects, who had often shielded at their home addresses. \u201cSome of them actually aren\u2019t so bright, and they\u2019re in rather obvious places,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Dick pledged new tactics to stop crime returning to pre-lockdown levels, including having officers visit 1,000 alleged violent offenders twice each to offer them a chance to give up crime.</p> <p>Knife crime in the capital, which has been the continual crisis of Dick\u2019s commissionership since 2017, is down by more than 50%, and stab wounds among people under 25 have fallen by 69%. Across the UK, police have reported huge falls in crime.</p> <p>Dick said: \u201cAs the restrictions ease, we are absolutely determined to continue to bear down on violence, on violent people, to police those places where violence takes place as well as we possibly can, and to prevent an escalation of violence back anywhere near the previous levels.\u201d</p> <p>She said that despite the streets being emptier, the Met had increased the use of stop and search compared with a year ago. The force carried out 30,608 stops in April, up from 20,981 in April 2019 and 23,783 in March this year. The Met says one in five led to a \u201cpositive outcome\u201d.</p> <p>The backdrop for the Met is that homicides in the capital rose in 2019 while elsewhere in England they fell. </p> <p>The assistant commissioner, Nick Ephgrave, said the time criminals had had at home and away from the streets during lockdown may have made them realise there is value in being with their families.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to make sure that we give those individuals an opportunity to reset their lives in a more positive way, so we are visiting every single one of those individuals twice and offering them the opportunity to engage in diversionary activities.\u201d </p> <p>Ephgrave said there had been a big fall in numbers of missing children who may have been victims of exploitation by gangs and organised crime, such as for county lines drug dealing.</p> <p>Separately, police in England have been told they cannot enforce physical distancing, while officers in Wales have been told they can.</p> <p>As changes to some lockdown rules came into effect in England but not in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the College of Policing and police chiefs issued guidance to 125,000 officers.</p> <p>They said to apply legal guidelines only, and not what officers may have heard from politicians. </p> <p>In Wales, the guidance says, \u201cTwo-metre distancing is enforceable\u201d and exercise is allowed only in an \u201carea local to the place where the person is living\u201d.</p> <p>The guidance also says: \u201cThe police have no powers to enforce two-metre distancing in England.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>Hotels, restaurants and beaches across Europe are being asked to enforce social distancing between guests, including booking slots at the pool and keeping 1.5m apart in the buffet queue, as the <strong>EU</strong> has urged a gradual reopening of the bloc\u2019s internal borders to salvage at least some of the summer holiday season.</p> <p>With debate over rules on masks continuing in several European countries, the <strong>European commission</strong> called on Wednesday for a \u201ccareful\u201d easing of restrictions and unveiled guidelines ranging from wearing face coverings on planes and trains to maintaining physical distancing on the beach and in hotels.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not going to be a normal summer, not for any of us,\u201d the European commission vice-president, Margrethe Vestager, said. She urged governments and businesses to follow Brussels\u2019 recommendations so that \u201cwe don\u2019t have to face a summer stuck at home \u2013 or a completely lost summer for the European tourist industry\u201d.</p> <p>Hotels are being asked to consider enabling guests to book slots at the pool, gym or restaurant. Large public spaces such as buffets should ensure guests not in the same family can remain at least 1.5 metres apart, while big events such as concerts are discouraged.</p> <p>Guests should be advised on \u201crespiratory etiquette\u201d, namely sneezing or coughing into a tissue or a bent elbow, and issued with frequent reminders to wash their hands. Hotels would also be expected to keep address records to allow contact tracing in the event of an outbreak of coronavirus.</p> <p>The non-binding guidelines are an attempt to ease a fall-off in travel that has emptied Europe\u2019s beaches and squares of tourists since mid-March, threatening millions of jobs in a sector that accounts for 10% of the bloc\u2019s economy.</p> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s guidance can be the chance of a better season for the many Europeans whose livelihood depends on tourism and of course for those who would like to travel this summer,\u201d Vestager said.</p> <p>Travellers are being asked to wear face masks on all modes of transport and in airports and stations, and transport workers to wear masks and gloves. Buses, trains and ferries are encouraged to run with fewer people, although airlines will not be required to leave middle seats empty.</p> <p><strong>Germany</strong> said on Wednesday that it would start relaxing entry controls on its borders with EU members from this weekend, but <strong>Spain</strong>, one of the continent\u2019s biggest tourist destinations,<strong> </strong>said it could wait until July.</p> <p>Decisions on the reopening of borders are the responsibility of national governments, but the commission urged the 27 member states to coordinate lifting their restrictions in stages, starting with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/eu-reopen-borders-tourists-covid-19-recovery-plan\">countries with </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/eu-reopen-borders-tourists-covid-19-recovery-plan\">low levels of coronavirus</a>.</p> <p>European governments are already pressing ahead with their own plans to reopen at different speeds depending on their national circumstances. The three Baltic states of <strong>Estonia</strong>, <strong>Latvia</strong> and <strong>Lithuania</strong> will reopen borders to each others\u2019 citizens, creating a \u201ctravel bubble\u201d, from 15 May.</p> <p>The EU\u2019s external borders are to remain closed to non-essential travel until at least mid-June.</p> <p><strong>Germany\u2019s</strong> interior minister, Horst Seehofer, said Berlin had \u201cset the clear goal of free travel in Europe by mid-June\u201d. Checks on the border with Luxembourg would be be dropped as early as Saturday, he said, and Berlin was consulting with Copenhagen on lifting all controls on the Danish border.</p> <p>Germany also plans to open all border crossings with France, Switzerland and Austria, rather than selected ones as at present, with spot checks replacing systematic controls.</p> <p>Earlier, Vienna said it was opening its borders with Germany and working on staggered reopenings with Switzerland, Liechtenstein and some eastern European countries.</p> <p>Spain will however impose a two-week quarantine on all travellers arriving from abroad from Friday, and two foreign ministry sources told Reuters that Madrid aimed to keep its borders closed to most travellers from abroad until July.</p> <p>The head of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies, Fernando Sim\u00f3n, has recommended the wearing of masks in all public spaces, amid reports that the government is considering making their use compulsory. At present masks are mandatory only on public transport. They have been handed out at train and metro stations.</p> <p>Sim\u00f3n said the best measure to control the virus was \u201ckeeping the two-metre distance\u201d, but added that masks \u201ccan be really helpful when it comes to controlling the epidemic\u201d.</p> <p>In Germany, face masks are obligatory on public transport and, in most regions, inside shops, but increasing numbers of people are taking legal action arguing that masks hinder personal expression and are not proven to be an effective tool against curbing the virus.</p> <p>Masks are also obligatory on public transport in <strong>France</strong>, and most stores prefer shoppers to wear them. The Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo, has again asked the government if she can reopen the city\u2019s parks and gardens and said she would make it mandatory to wear a mask in them if permission is granted.</p> <p>The <strong>Belgian </strong>government said schools, museums and hairdressers would be allowed to start reopening under strict distancing and hygiene conditions from 18 May. Marriages and funerals will be allowed to go ahead with no more than 30 guests, and street markets may start trading again with a maximum of 50 traders, who must wear masks.</p> <p><strong>Russia, </strong>Europe\u2019s new coronavirus hotspot, again reported more than 10,000 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday. The health minister, Mikhail Murashko, said more than 100,000 patients had been hospitalised.</p> <p>Fears are growing of a second wave in <strong>China</strong>, with the north-eastern city of Jilin put in partial lockdown and Wuhan, where the virus first appeared last year, preparing to test its entire population after clusters of new cases.</p> <p>The coronavirus has infected 4.3 million people worldwide, according to the <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">Johns Hopkins University tracker</a>, and killed more than 293,000.</p> <p><em>With reporting from Sam Jones in Madrid and Kate Connolly in Berlin</em></p>",
  "<p>Child abusers have created and shared an online grooming manual describing ways to manipulate and exploit the increased number of children at home and online during Covid-19, Australia\u2019s e-safety commissioner has said.</p> <p>Covid-19 restrictions have coincided with a significant increase in reports to the eSafety Office about child sexual abuse material, Julie Inman Grant told Guardian Australia. She said investigators had seen a jump in searches by predators on the dark web seeking information on how to abuse children.</p> <p>\u201cI think of it like bees in a hive, gathering around the honey,\u201d Inman Grant said. \u201cAbusers see Covid-19 as a honey pot for them, with at-risk boys and girls spending much more time at home and online, often without supervision, and often while feeling isolated and lonely.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/feb/27/i-just-burst-into-tears-partners-men-commit-child-abuse-crimes\">'I just burst into tears': the partners of men who commit child abuse crimes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Covid-19 predator handbook contained details about how to coerce children online to share sexual images and videos of themselves, she said. \u201cThe handbook advises predators to get their kicks online rather than trying to meet children face-to-face because of restrictions and heightened vigilance of law enforcement on the streets,\u201d Inman Grant said.</p> <p>Investigators had seen a marked increase in a phenomena known as \u201ccapping\u201d, she said, where abusers took screenshots during explicit video calls and live streams with minors, and then circulated them widely or used them to coerce children.</p> <p>There was an average of 670 reports per month to the commission in 2019. Data provided by the commissioner to Guardian Australia shows child sexual abuse material reports increased 27% in March and 37% in April 2020. While reports of abuse had been steadily increasing before Covid-19 restrictions, Inman Grant said there was no doubt the pandemic had contributed in part, while raising the risk of children being abused online.</p> <p>\u201cMore disturbing than the stats, perhaps, is that our investigators have also seen increased chat on forums on the dark web from predators talking about how with isolation measures in place, they have greater opportunities to contact children remotely to groom them for sexual exploitation, while others observe that they have more time to abuse children,\u201d a spokeswoman from the eSafety Office said.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve picked up other users commenting that Covid-19 is bringing more youth online to platforms such as YouTube, vlog sites, online challenges and Omegle, creating more opportunity to groom them.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the Australian federal police, which runs the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation, said the organisation regularly saw cases involving children and young people being targeted through social networking, image or video-sharing apps or instant messaging, where offenders encouraged the children to self-produce online exploitation material. The centre\u2019s past six months of data show reports between October 2019 and March 2020 increased by 123% compared with the same period the previous year.</p> <p>\u201cThis increased the average number of reports from 776 report per month to 1,731 reports per month,\u201d the AFP spokesman said.</p> <p>According to research commissioned by the centre, only 52% of parents or carers talked to their children about online safety. \u201cIf you are unsure about an app, game or site, research and review them yourself to understand both the positive and negative aspects,\u201d the spokesman said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is important to make children feel comfortable to approach you or another trusted adult if something isn\u2019t right to help them deal with the issue, rather than the technology. Children may be reluctant to report issues online if they believe they will be punished or have their devices taken away.</p> <p>\u201cSupervision is recommended for younger children as well as encouraging your child to apply critical thinking skills, like questioning suspicious behaviour or \u2018friend\u2019 requests from other users online.\u201d</p> <p>Child abuse crimes were \u201cdevastating for victims and their families\u201d, he said.</p> <p>Jessie Smith (not her real name) is a peer support worker with <a href=\"https://www.partnerspeak.org.au/contact\">PartnerSPEAK</a>, Australia\u2019s only not-for-profit organisation that supports people whose partners have been caught with child abuse material. She said the spouses of those caught abusing were also at risk during Covid-19. In recent weeks, Smith said she had taken calls from women whose homes had been raided by police and their partners interrogated during Covid-19 restrictions.</p> <p>In April, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/20/sixteen-people-arrested-in-five-australian-states-over-child-abuse-material-website\">16 people across five states were charged</a> with more than 700 child exploitation offences after a two-year investigation involving Australian authorities and US Homeland Security investigators. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2020/04/24/child-exploitation-complaints-rise-106-to-hit-2-million-in-just-one-month-is-covid-19-to-blame/#4c7482964c9c\">Reports of child sexual abuse material have increased 106% in the US</a> since the pandemic restrictions began. Smith said alleged perpetrators were often released back to their homes while police continued investigations.</p> <p>\u201cHalf a dozen officers arrive with a search warrant to go through their house and to interview the suspect,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAfter the initial interview they\u2019re rereleased back into the home and these frightened women are in a situation where the financial and practical implications of leaving are exacerbated because of the pandemic and they may struggle to call for help because the abuser is there with them.\u201d PartnerSPEAK has launched a new webchat to make it easier and safer for affected family members to contact the organisation during the pandemic.</p> <p>Smith\u2019s own partner was jailed several years ago after being found guilty of sexually abusing her two children, including recording the offending. Smith found a video of the abuse on his phone, and took it straight to police. While her then partner was being interviewed by police, she packed up her children into the car and left. \u201cI had less than a two-hour head start to run while he was being interviewed, and I had no money because he controlled the finances,\u201d she said. When the police interview finished he was given money for a meal and a train ticket.</p> <p>But leaving would be difficult for victims during lockdown, she said, particularly if their support networks were interstate or overseas. Abusers who had been furloughed during the pandemic, but whose partners had not, might now also be the primary carers for children, giving them more opportunity to offend, she said, a concern shared by Inman Grant.</p> <p>\u201cMany women and children feel they have nowhere to go,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWhereas women would have previously sought support for themselves from their community, that community support system has fallen down at the moment. I have no doubt if I had of been forced to stay home with my partner after I found out, he would have killed me.\u201d</p> <p>Smith said most offenders producing and sharing child abuse material were men, and half of those perpetrators had families and children. Children were most likely to be abused or neglected by parents or caregivers.</p> <p>\u201cMy concerns are that these children will be exposed to things during lockdown that might previously have been more difficult for their abusers to get away with,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have more access to children. Before lockdown we had layers of protection from teachers, doctors and others who may notice something wrong.</p> <p>\u201cThose protections are gone for many children.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Resources for parents can be found at <a href=\"https://www.accce.gov.au/resources\">https://www.accce.gov.au/resources</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thinkuknow.org.au/parents-portal\">https://www.thinkuknow.org.au/parents-portal</a></strong></em></p></li> <li><p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.partnerspeak.org.au/contact\">PartnerSPEAK</a>: 1300 590 589</strong></em></p></li> <li><p><em><strong><a href=\"https://kidshelpline.com.au/\">Kids Helpline</a>: <a href=\"tel://1800551800\">1800 55 1800</a></strong></em></p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>Northern Ireland\u2019s human rights commissioner warned that the government was at risk of breaching the law with \u201cpuzzling and troublesome\u201d plans to limit prosecutions of British soldiers who served during the Troubles, it has been revealed.</p> <p>In a letter, Les Allamby said he had told ministers he had \u201cdeep initial concerns\u201d about how their plans could satisfy European convention article 2 rights to a proper investigation where deaths involve the state.</p> <p>Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, outlined in mid-March how the government hoped to deal with a backlog of 900 unresolved cases relating to the deaths of 1,200 people in the 30-year conflict brought to a close by the 1998 Good Friday agreement.</p> <p>Many deaths were not fairly investigated during the conflict, a time when police and judicial processes often broke down, and cases such as that of Soldier F \u2013 a former paratrooper accused of murdering two civil rights protesters on Bloody Sunday 1972 \u2013 are only now coming to trial.</p> <p>In the newly disclosed correspondence, the commissioner took aim at the government\u2019s core proposal to hold <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/addressing-northern-ireland-legacy-issues\">\u201can effective and thorough, but quick\u201d</a> review of the legacy of outstanding cases. He argued that such a strategy \u201cappears to be counterintuitive\u201d.</p> <p>The three-page letter was sent to Labour\u2019s Louise Haigh, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, and has been shared with the Guardian.</p> <p>Allamby said that under article 2 of the European convention, which protects the right to life, investigations involving deaths relating to the state needed to be \u201cthorough, objective and impartial\u201d. The government proposals appeared to conflate police investigation with prosecutorial analysis, he said.</p> <p>The Conservatives have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/18/bill-sets-five-year-limit-to-sue-uk-military-veterans-who-served-abroad\">introduced a bill</a> proposing that British soldiers who served in Iraq and Afghanistan have an amnesty against prosecution for cases dating back more than five years. But extending the amnesty to cover a part of the UK has proved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/16/troubles-victims-families-warn-against-amnesty-for-soldiers-northern-ireland\">controversial with victims\u2019 families</a>, particularly in the nationalist community.</p> <p>Labour said it was anxious about the government embarking on \u201ca unilateral approach\u201d that might not obtain the consent of victims and communities in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Haigh said: \u201cIn dealing with the painful legacy of the past, there must be no decision about Northern Ireland without Northern Ireland, and the voice of victims must be heard when decisions are taken in Westminster. They must not be an afterthought.\u201d</p> <p>In March the government said the aim was to ensure \u201cequal treatment of Northern Ireland veterans and those who served overseas\u201d \u2013 a comparison Allamby said was \u201cpuzzling and troublesome\u201d, in his letter to the Labour MP.</p> <p>The commissioner added: \u201cThere is no obvious justification for expanding and conflating the circumstances in Afghanistan and Iraq with our own experience of the conflict in Northern Ireland.\u201d</p> <p>Most of the unresolved Troubles deaths are attributed to republican or loyalist paramilitaries, but <a href=\"https://www.thedetail.tv/articles/new-figures-reveal-scale-of-unsolved-killings-from-the-troubles\">29% involve security personnel</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/25/up-to-200-ex-soldiers-being-investigated-over-troubles-allegations\">up to 200 soldiers</a>. Several Conservative backbenchers have been pushing for prosecutions in all but the most egregious of cases to be halted.</p> <p>The issue of how to deal with legacy cases is expected to come up on Thursday when Lewis is due to appear before parliament\u2019s Northern Ireland select committee.</p> <p>Allamby told Haigh he had set out his concerns already in a letter to Lewis.</p> <p>The Northern Ireland Office has been approached for comment.</p> <p>A UK Government spokesperson said it was committed to tackling the legacy in Northern Ireland - and that its approach would be legal: \u201cThe Government believes in the rule of law - where there is compelling new evidence which brings a realistic prospect of a conviction, this should and will be pursued. That is why our proposals will provide for Article 2 compliant investigations.</p> <p>\u201cBut we must be clear that, with the passage of time, the number of convictions flowing from any process is likely to be low. That is why focusing on information recovery and reconciliation is vital, before that information is lost.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 14 May 2020 to include a statement from a UK Government spokesperson that an earlier version omitted in error.</p>",
  "<p>Life on a film set is hard enough, with personality clashes, squeezed budgets and last-minute script changes, but now Covid-19 has forced the industry to confront a far bigger existential problem: can the show really still go on?</p> <p>This week the government gave the green light for filming to start again as long as production companies comply with physical-distancing guidelines, promising to work closely with the screen sector in order to \u201cgive confidence\u201d that they can return to sets safely.</p> <p>But British film and TV producers are concerned that the UK is \u201cbehind the curve\u201d on developing guidance that combats the risk of Covid-19 on sets, with some predicting that filming on British-based dramas will not start until September or October at the earliest.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/29/bbc-could-quarantine-actors-and-crews-on-dramas-to-aid-filming\">BBC could quarantine actors and crews on dramas to aid filming</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Production teams are awaiting new industry-wide guidance on how to work safely on sets from the British Film Commission (BFC), the national agency that has undertaken a consultation process asking figures from across the industry to give their feedback on new safe-working standards.</p> <p>Andrew Eaton, who produced the first two seasons of The Crown and the Formula One film drama Rush, said countries such as Iceland and Sweden, where filming has already restarted, have been better at providing film and TV production teams with clear standards.</p> <p>\u201cIt is real finger-in-the-air stuff at the moment,\u201d said Eaton. \u201cNo one really knows until we start doing this what the practicalities are. The BFC is slightly behind the curve, we\u2019ve already had guidelines from the Nordic countries, and from some studios in America.\u201d</p> <p>Eaton said September or October was being discussed privately as a realistic return date for productions, but that when they eventually do restart it will be in a dramatically different landscape. \u201cIf you\u2019re working with an older actor, they might say, \u2018I\u2019m not happy to do intimate scenes,\u2019\u201d said Eaton. \u201c There are going to be moral issues about whether or not we are putting people at risk.\u201d</p> <p>Adrian Wootton, the BFC chief executive, said once the consultation is concluded on Friday the new procedures will be considered by Public Health England and if signed off they could work as a \u201croadmap\u201d for studios and filmmakers. \u201cWe really have to get this done and get government supporting it before we flag up a false dawn by saying everyone is ready to go when they\u2019re not,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not a cosmetic exercise. We\u2019re not saying, \u2018Here\u2019s a guidebook, you can carry on as you did before,\u2019 because no one believes that is possible. It\u2019s only going to be possible if there are adaptations,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Those moral questions are butting up against the economic reality for an industry where the majority of the workforce is freelance, and many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-support-loophole-uk-film-tv-staff-without-pay-mps\">do not qualify for government support schemes</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s \u00a31bn worth of mothballed production in the UK,\u201d said Wootton. \u201cWhat we want is to help start that up again because then thousands of people can get their jobs back and we can start generating really big amounts of revenue for the UK. We want to do that, but do it safely.\u201d</p> <p>Netflix, which has stopped all UK production, has started filming again in other countries, putting in place ad-hoc measures depending on location. In South Korea, where Netflix is filming two dramas, cast and crews regularly have their temperatures taken, and if anyone shows signs of infection, production is paused. In Iceland, where testing is more widely available, the whole cast and crew of the Scandi thriller Katla agreed to be tested before filming started.</p> <p>The lack of testing availability in the UK is a key concern for producers, Eaton said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got the ability to test and continue monitoring people, it\u2019s much easier to feel that people are safe and to control it.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people I know are researching online how can we get access to test kits, some are looking into getting scanners to take people\u2019s temperatures. I\u2019m sure on bigger productions they\u2019ll be investing in that kind of kit to keep people safe.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/23/tell-us-have-you-been-affected-by-the-coronavirus\">Tell us: how have you been affected by the coronavirus?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another issue is insurance. Eaton said there was a fear that if filming starts again and there is a Covid-19 outbreak on set, productions that are not sufficiently covered could be plunged into financial uncertainty. \u201cIf you start filming and your lead actor gets ill or has the symptoms, then you\u2019d have to stop, and everyone who they\u2019re in contact with would have to self-isolate.</p> <p>\u201cThe worst thing that could happen is that someone starts filming soon and you get a case and that leads to more infections. If that happens, I\u2019m sure they will close us all down again.\u201d</p>",

Avoidable household and business insolvencies can weigh on growth for years to come. Long stretches of unemployment can damage or end workers\u2019 careers as their skills lose value and professional networks dry up, and leave families in greater debt. The loss of thousands of small- and medium-sized businesses across the country would destroy the life\u2019s work and family legacy of many business and community leaders and limit the strength of the recovery when it comes.</p> \n   <p>These businesses are a principal source of job creation\u2014something we will sorely need as people seek to return to work. A prolonged recession and weak recovery could also discourage business investment and expansion, further limiting the resurgence of jobs as well as the growth of capital stock and the pace of technological advancement. The result could be an extended period of low productivity growth and stagnant incomes.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In conclusion, Powell also warns that while the Fed can lend money to help companies keep afloat, only politicians can agree fiscal measures to help the economy:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Additional fiscal support could be costly, but worth it if it helps avoid long-term economic damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery. This tradeoff is one for our elected representatives, who wield powers of taxation and spending. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebbf0928f080c727453a19d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T13:17:57.575Z\">2.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">NIESR: UK GDP could shrink 30% this quarter</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Back in the UK, the NIESR thinktank has predicted Britain\u2019s economy could shrink by nearly a third in the current quarter.</strong></p> \n  <p>That would far outstrip anything seen in recent decades (<a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/timeseries/ihyq/qna\">the ONS\u2019s quarterly GDP time series</a> goes back to 1955, and shows that Q1 1974 was the worst quarter with a 2.7% drop)</p> \n  <p>Having analysed today\u2019s GDP report, IERS says:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The ONS preliminary estimates suggest that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/may/13/uk-economy-gdp-q1-2020-march-covid-19-recession-business-live?page=with:block-5ebb869d8f080c7274539dc8#block-5ebb869d8f080c7274539dc8\"> growth declined by 2.0 per cent in the first quarter of 2020</a>, broadly consistent with what we suggested it could be last month.<a><strong><br></strong></a></li> \n   <li>The substantive contraction in growth reflects negative contributions across all the headline sectors.</li> \n   <li> Output declined by 5.8 per cent in March itself, mainly due to record falls in construction and services.</li> \n   <li>The latest ONS estimates are preliminary and largely uncertain but continues to suggest GDP is around 25 per cent smaller when the lockdown is in place.</li> \n   <li>In light of the preliminary release, we forecast growth in the second quarter to decline sharply by about 25 to 30 per cent.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d90af4b349923661184748e77e43a13a1447e10e\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d90af4b349923661184748e77e43a13a1447e10e/0_0_570_313/500.jpg\" alt=\"UK GDP forecasts\" width=\"500\" height=\"275\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">UK GDP forecasts</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NIESR</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebbee188f080c727453a187\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T13:02:02.756Z\">2.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">US wholesale inflation tumbles as global economy weakens</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Over in America, the prices charged by companies for their wares has tumbled in another sign that the global economy is weakening fast.</strong></p> \n  <p>The US Producer Price Index (PPI) fell by 1.3% in April, driven by a 3.3% tumble in prices for goods.

  "<p>In 1918 the Spanish flu was slaughtering tens of millions around the world, yet in Paris the highest death rates were concentrated along the richest boulevards.

Here was the metropolitan working class \u00ad\u2013 typically black, Asian, eastern European \u2013 squeezing themselves off a packed bus. Meanwhile, their political masters eased themselves out of their ministerial Jags and into Downing Street.</p> <p>Countries have underlying health conditions too, easily preyed on by a virus. In the UK those chronic ailments include a government of bluffers, a society deformed by inequality and a public sector drained of both cash and confidence. They account for many of the 50,000 excess deaths over the past few weeks and the utter chaos in Westminster. You know the litany as well as I do: how Boris Johnson wasted precious weeks through lethal complacency; the multiple failures around equipment including ventilators and PPE; Matt Hancock\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/free-for-non-subscribers/hancock-challenged-over-covid-testing-numbers-by-stats-watchdog/7027620.article\">Potemkin testing regime</a>.</p> <p>From <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1278337/Australia-coronavirus-herd-immunity-Scott-Morrison-UK-US-covid-19\">Australia</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/uk-takes-a-pasting-from-worlds-press-over-coronavirus\">Germany</a>, politicians and newspapers are warning their people that, whatever happens, they really, really don\u2019t want to end up like the Brits.</p> <p>Still, it must be said: coronavirus has not ruined the UK; it has exposed the systemic ruin already here.</p> <p>What does national ruin look like? It is Hancock urging industry to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthancock/status/1239521271282577416?lang=en\">churn out</a> ventilators, only to realise that his Tory party had long ago destroyed the manufacturing base. Or cabinet ministers feigning control, even as the outsourcing firms they depend on to buy the NHS essential gowns, gloves and masks fail again and again.</p> <p>When one of the richest societies in human history has done less to protect its population from coronavirus than the Indian state of <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/asia/2020/05/09/vietnam-and-the-indian-state-of-kerala-curbed-covid-19-on-the-cheap\">Kerala</a>, that tells you that pandemic-hit UK\u2019s problem is neither a lack of cash nor an absence of knowledge. It is an unwillingness at the top of government to see our society as a collective where everyone matters rather than, say, a herd.</p> <p>These are the norms of today\u2019s Britain, and they are simply not normal. Yet in England this week we begin the slow and risky stagger right back to the broken social settlement that landed us in this catastrophe. Because however botched and fudged the announcements on the exit from the lockdown, that is where we are going. Offered a return to normal life, who among us would not seize it? To hug family and friends again, to wander without worry, or to pop into a shop \u00ad\u2013 just because? But that is not the normality demanded by Iain Duncan Smith, Steve Baker and other Tories on the hard right. Just listen to their language. For them, the priority is get things back to the way they were and to hell with the scientific advice.</p> <p>Never mind that experts reportedly believe the UK is racking up 18,000 <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/past-six-days/2020-05-10/news/coronavirus-100-000-dead-if-uk-eases-lockdown-too-fast-scientists-warn-rqqbf956g\">new infections</a> every day, more than four times the government target. Get businesses humming! Run the NHS hot! Not a whisper about paying essential workers more, or funding public services. Nothing about fostering strategic industries or shortening supply chains for food or crucial supplies. No lessons learned, no regrets earned. On the contrary, many would be delighted by today\u2019s leak of Treasury plans for a <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/05/12/exclusive-treasury-blueprint-raise-taxes-freeze-wages-pay-300bn/\">freeze</a> in public sector pay.</p> <p>This is the leave brigade and they have found their new cause: Get Exit Done. Even if you accept their premise, the argument still runs into two massive roadblocks. The first is that further waves of infection will very effectively derail the economy. At this moment any country\u2019s economic strategy is essentially its health strategy, and its health strategy is to a large extent its public communications strategy, which is why this week\u2019s national confusion over who can do what, where and with whom is so disastrous.</p> <p>When in 1918 the Spanish flu hit America, cities from Pittsburgh to Seattle responded in very different ways. Some locked down for three weeks; others for 10. What was the result? Surely, your average Tory backbencher or puckish columnist would say, it\u2019s obvious: the harder you hit the virus, the greater the harm to the economy. In fact, the opposite is true, according to <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Papers.cfm?abstract_id=3561560\">analysis</a> published this March by three economists, two of them at the US central bank. They find the economies of \u201ccities that intervened earlier and more aggressively do not perform worse and, if anything, grow faster after the pandemic is over\u201d.</p> <p>The title of the economists\u2019 study says it all: \u201cPandemics depress the economy, public health interventions do not.\u201d I have not seen it quoted anywhere by the hard exiters or the supposedly science-hungry cabinet. Funny that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/13/uk-economy-shrank-2-in-first-quarter-record-monthly-plunge-ons-cfovid-19-lockdown-gdp\">Britain is facing 'significant recession', says Rishi Sunak</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The second big argument against the desire for economic normality is that no such thing exists right now.

The announcement this week by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, that he will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/12/uk-furlough-scheme-extended-rishi-sunak-coronavirus\">extend his \u00a360bn furlough scheme</a>, paying most of the wages of 7.5 million private-sector staff until at least autumn is not only the right thing to do \u00ad\u2013 switching off the programme could lead to very scary politics.</p> <p>Millions who consider themselves temporarily idle employees, many with a mortgage, would plunge through a trapdoor into the ranks of the unemployed. The result of that huge collective drop in status, income and living standards could quite easily be a collapse in social order, and a rise in extremism.</p> <p>That is the prospect hanging over us \u00ad\u2013 and not just this year. The Bank forecasts that 2021 will be the year of the bounceback, the V-shaped recovery. Such a scenario seems to me utter fantasy. Pubs, cafe and theatres will shut by the score, many more businesses will run out of cash and time. At the end of the summer, the class of 2020 will leave school, graduate from university \u00ad\u2013 and there will be scarcely any jobs for them.</p> <p>For now and for a while to come, pretty much the only thing keeping the UK and the US ticking over is the state. The government is borrowing historic amounts to bail out households and prop up companies and those loans are being swallowed by another arm of the state, the central bank. This is the same strategy as we saw after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/28/markets-credit-crunch-banking-2008\">crash of 2008</a> \u00ad\u2013 only this time moving much faster and at far greater scale.

We value all the information provided to us by members of the public aimed at helping us achieve that goal\u201d.</p> \n<p>A spokesperson added: \u201cWe\u2019d ask anyone concerned that their employer might be abusing the scheme to please contact us. It could be that you\u2019re not being paid what you\u2019re entitled to, they might be asking you to work while you\u2019re on furlough, or they may have claimed for times when you were working.\u201d</p> \n<p>The spokesperson said that HMRC would assess each report and would help put right \u201ca genuine mistake\u201d. They added that reports of fraud were only one way that claims were checked and payments may be withheld or would have to be repaid if they were based on dishonest or inaccurate information.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe won\u2019t hesitate to take criminal action against the most serious cases,\u201d the spokesperson said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8507cb83-7188-4e74-bd39-539de6dba7db\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Dishonestly making a false representation to HMRC with the intention of obtaining a payment under the furlough scheme is an offence of fraud. Any company director found guilty of abusing the system could face up to 10 years imprisonment and unlimited fines. Those who assist in the fraud could face similar punishment.</p> \n<p>The Guardian has received reports from at least 10 members of the public who say they have been asked to work while on furlough.</p> \n<p>A finance worker told the Guardian she had been given the impression that if she didn\u2019t work she would be fired. \u201cKnowing that my company is fraudulently making us work while taking money from the government is really impacting my mental health.

Despite their protestations, Get Orf My Land Fiver joyfully booted his recently sheared and scared witless stock into the murky brew, cackling like a gammon-faced loon as he pictured all the cash he\u2019d be able to shove into the pockets of his mustard corduroys when his sanitised product was considered saleable.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/13/safety-consultant-warns-premier-league-must-put-lives-before-money\">Safety consultant warns Premier League must put lives before money</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It\u2019s a scene we were reminded of as we read reports of the protocols the Premier League will put in place in order to get the first phase of team training under way next Monday. The English top flight\u2019s flock of players will be chased down from the hills to their club\u2019s sterile training bases, where they will be hoofed by a bleached boot on to disinfected pitches to play football using hosed-down balls, cones, goalposts and corner flags while wearing masks. Physical distancing will be \u201cstrictly observed\u201d at all times, no tackling will be allowed and players will be unable to engage in dressing-room b@ntz or shower afterwards, instead being corralled towards their cars and told to go home immediately. Sounds wild.</p> \n<p>In addition, they will be expected to undergo twice-weekly testing and a daily questionnaire and temperature check. Even if such stringent conditions are observed there is no guarantee that a footballer will be safe. Or a footballer\u2019s family member. Or a staff member. Or \u2026 well you get the picture. But at least there is a massive appetite for football, even if it means treating panicked Premier League footballers like sheep on dipping day to get them to market, right?

  "<p>Springtime in Montreal is normally a cause for celebration. After the city\u2019s long, arduous winters, people emerge from the confines of their apartments at the first inkling of warmth to lounge in parks and on patios \u2013 or <em>terrasses</em> \u2013 and enjoy a meal, beverage and the company of friends.</p> <p>Not this year.</p> <p>Montreal, a city touted by tourist guides as \u201cNorth America\u2019s Europe\u201d for its rich culture and joie de vivre, is Canada\u2019s centre for Covid-19. Of the entire country\u2019s 70,000 cases and 5,000 deaths, the city of 2 million people has <a href=\"https://santemontreal.qc.ca/population/coronavirus-covid-19/#c36391\">20,000 cases and more than 2,000 deaths</a>, or about 64% of the entire <a href=\"https://www.inspq.qc.ca/covid-19/donnees/details\">province\u2019s death toll</a>.</p> <p>Those numbers have catapulted Quebec into an unfavourable position: it is now the seventh deadliest place in the world for daily coronavirus deaths, according to <a href=\"https://www.lapresse.ca/covid-19/202005/10/01-5272977-le-quebec-en-septieme-place-au-monde-pour-les-morts-quotidiens.php\">Quebec newspaper La Presse</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a7ef9a43ee325c4083330d5b0b68b0c964fc1ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a7ef9a43ee325c4083330d5b0b68b0c964fc1ec/0_347_4592_2754/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The empty streets of downtown Montreal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The empty streets of downtown Montreal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Ouellet/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe are all concerned about Montreal,\u201d said Quebec\u2019s premier, Fran\u00e7ois Legault, on Monday, saying that the situation there was \u201cnot under control\u201d.

A horrific expos\u00e9 in the Montreal Gazette revealed that a local nursing home \u2013 known by its French initials as a CHSLD \u2013 had <a href=\"https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/records-reveal-chaos-in-the-days-before-staff-abandoned-the-herron/\">concealed the deaths of 31 seniors</a>.

According to La Presse, at least 141 CHSLDs in Montreal presently have at least one case of Covid-19, but that the government won\u2019t say which ones. Meanwhile, the Quebec government has announced it will <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/covid-19-quebec-may-5-1.5555549\">allow</a><a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/covid-19-quebec-may-5-1.5555549\"> caregivers back into some CHSLDs</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/canada-coronavirus-covid-19-provinces-trudeau\">Canada's bid to beat back coronavirus exposes stark gaps between the provinces</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The other part of Montreal\u2019s Covid-19 story can be summed up by the case of <a href=\"https://plus.lapresse.ca/screens/3c5f9503-455d-479e-9b25-72fa1b1944c8__7C___0.html?utm_medium=Twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Microsite+Share&amp;utm_content=Screen\">Marcelin Fran\u00e7ois</a>, a 40-year-old Haitian asylum seeker who died in his wife\u2019s arms inside their Montreal apartment in mid-April.</p> <p>During the week, Fran\u00e7ois worked in a textile factory. On Saturdays and Sundays, he worked as an orderly inside whichever CHSLD his temp agency dispatched him to that week.</p> <p>He lived with his family in Montreal North, one of the poorest neighbourhoods in all of Canada. It is a popular destination for asylum seekers \u2013 many of whom crossed the US\u2013Canada border on foot shortly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/20/over-15000-have-crossed-us-canada-border-amid-deportation-fears-under-trump\">after American president Donald Trump took office</a>. Half of the neighbourhood\u2019s residents are members of a visible minority, and 42% are immigrants.</p> <p>Like Fran\u00e7ois, many asylum seekers are now working, without citizenship status, inside of Quebec\u2019s seniors residences. And then they\u2019re coming home at the end of their shift, to crowded apartments they share with friends and family, inside of <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-cartierville-apartments-cockroaches-bed-bugs-1.3939127\">shoddily maintained apartment buildings</a>.</p> <p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-covid-cross-contamination-1.5556946\">the province admitted</a> that its effort to manage staffing shortages by moving workers around the long-term care network could be spreading the virus. Montreal North feels the consequences of that. One in five Montrealers infected with Covid-19 are healthcare workers \u2013 none of whom are receiving danger pay. In Montreal North, 23% are infected, said community organizer Will Prosper.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s these people who are still taking care of us, when not too long ago they were the people who we wanted to kick out,\u201d said Prosper.</p> <p>Other areas of Montreal badly hit by Covid-19 share similar traits with Montreal North: low-income, large immigrant communities, many people of colour, poor quality housing. Montreal\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.crarr.org/?q=node/20102\">Centre for Research-Action on Race Relations</a> is demanding the federal and provincial governments collect data on the race and income level of Covid victims. </p> <p>Nargess Mustapha, also a community organizer in Montreal North and the president of youth empowerment organization Hoodstock, doesn\u2019t need data to see how Covid-19 has further entrenched existing inequalities. She\u2019s on the ground, along with an army of young volunteers, distributing mask-and-sanitizer kits and food hampers to members of her community.</p> <p>She recites a long list of reasons why Covid-19 has struck her neighbourhood so deeply: a lack of health services, inadequate transit access, people living in crowded apartments, poor relations with police \u2013 especially now that officers can hand out $1,500 fines to those not respecting self-isolation measures.</p> <p>Meanwhile, 42% of homes are single-parent households, which makes things like child care for essential workers very complicated. And, a lack of internet access makes it tough to get government aid and information being distributed almost exclusively online.</p> <p>\u201cBeing able to socially distance is a sign of privilege,\u201d Mustapha said in French, pointing out that the population density of one neighbourhood sector rivals that of New York City\u2019s densest borough. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to apply those rules in Montreal North.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The legality of every internment during the Troubles will have to be scrutinised, the former Sinn F\u00e9in leader Gerry Adams has urged, after his convictions for escaping from the Maze prison were quashed by the supreme court.</p> <p>The unanimous decision of the UK\u2019s highest court is likely to affect scores of claims from republicans and loyalists who are challenging their detention without trial during the 1970s.</p> <p>Five justices ruled that because the then secretary of state for Northern Ireland, Willie Whitelaw, had not personally considered whether to intern Adams, the requirements of the Detention of Terrorists (Northern Ireland) Order 1972 were not satisfied.</p> <p>Delivering judgment, Lord Kerr said: \u201cIt was clearly intended that the making of an [interim custody order] ICO, as opposed to the signing of the order, had to be the outcome of personal consideration by the secretary of state. In this case, a minister in the Northern Ireland Office had made the ICO. That minister could have signed the order, but he could not validly make it.</p> <p>\u201cAs a result, Mr Adams\u2019 detention had not been lawfully authorised. His detention was therefore invalid, and it followed that he should not have been convicted of attempting to escape from lawful custody for the elementary but inevitable reason that the custody in which he had been detained was, in fact, not lawful. His appeal is therefore allowed, and his convictions are quashed.\u201d</p> <p>Adams, 71, who has always denied being a member of the IRA, called on the government to identify and inform others whose internment may also have been unlawful. Between 1971 and 1975 almost 2,000 people were detained without trial.</p> <p>Documents released to the public records office under the 30-year rule revealed that the British prime minister at the time, Harold Wilson, knew there had been procedural irregularities in the detention of Adams and other republicans who tried to escape from the heavily guarded camp.</p> <p>\u201cSo the knowledge of my unlawful detention was known by the most senior level of the British system,\u201d Adams said after the judgment.</p> <p>\u201cOf course internment \u2026 was never lawful. In fact it set aside the normal principles of law and was based on a blunt and brutal piece of coercive legislation. I have no regrets about my imprisonment, except for the time I was separated from my family.</p> <p>\u201cThere is an onus on the British government to identify and inform other internees whose internment may also have been unlawful.\u201d</p> <p>KRW Law, the Belfast solicitors acting on behalf of 15 former republican and 19 former loyalist internees, said their orders will have to be checked to see whether there had been \u201cproper authorisation by the relevant secretary of state at the time of detention\u201d.</p> <p>Those held were overwhelmingly nationalists or republicans; not all were members of paramilitary organisations.</p> <p>Adams was first interned in March 1972 and was released in June that year to take part in secret talks with the Conservative government in London.</p> <p>He was rearrested in July 1973 in Belfast and taken to the Maze, also known as Long Kesh detention centre. On Christmas Eve 1973 he was one of four detainees caught attempting to break out. A hole had been cut in a perimeter fence and all four men were already out of the prison.</p> <p>His second attempt, in July 1974involved kidnapping a man who had a striking resemblance to him from a bus stop in west Belfast. The man was taken to a house where his hair was dyed and he was given a false beard.</p> <p>His double was driven to the Maze where the plan was that he would be swapped for Adams in a visiting hut. Prison staff had been alerted, however, and Adams was arrested. </p> <p>The leader of the Ulster Unionist party, Steve Aiken, said IRA victims would be \u201cleft dismayed and angry\u201d by the judicial decision.</p>",
  "<p>Toshio Matsumoto\u2019s 1969 film is a fusillade of haunted images and traumatised glimpses, splattered across a realist melodrama of the Tokyo underground club scene, played out in a fiercely beautiful monochrome. (It is reissued as part of <a href=\"https://www.bfi.org.uk/japan\">the BFI\u2019s Japan 2020 season</a> which has now been forced to migrate to streaming until cinemas reopen.)</p> <p>Eddie, played by the then-unknown performer P\u00eet\u00e2, is a transgender bar hostess and rising star of a place named the Genet \u2013 Matsumoto leaves it up to us to ponder the associations. Eddie is having a passionate affair with the club\u2019s owner, Gonda (played by Kurosawa regular Yoshio Tsuchiya), and has ignited the passionate rage and jealousy of Gonda\u2019s other lover and employee, the transgender hostess, Leda (Osamu Ogasawara). As their love triangle proceeds to its operatic conclusion, Matsumoto gives us perspectives on the subliminal flashes of horror that flicker across the film\u2019s retina. Eddie has had a tragic relationship with her parents, a quasi-Oedipal nightmare that involves violence to both.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EteaHqdX6hU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EteaHqdX6hU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Funeral Parade of Roses is a jagged shard of a film, an underground dream of longing and despair, an excursion away from narrative and a great example of the Japanese New Wave, which like the French New Wave offers you slogans, inter-titles, street-demos, film-within-a-film location scenes, newsreel-style interviews with the actors, evocative <em>v\u00e9rit\u00e9 </em>streetscapes of Tokyo (quite the equal of the French directors\u2019 depictions of Paris) with real passers-by cheekily roped into being stunned-looking extras without their permission. There is also the uncompromising thump of New Wave sound editing: music or background noise will cracklingly cut to silence on a change of scene.</p> <p>\u201cAll definitions of cinema have been erased,\u201d says an underground film-maker nicknamed Guevara in one scene, quoting Jonas Mekas, and getting told off for accidentally calling him Mekas Jonas. Definitions are certainly challenged here, although it also works within existing definitions. Matusmoto is probably riffing on Psycho with his shower scene and the language of Resnais and Godard.

  "<p>\u201cIn the war against any infectious virus,\u201d says Dr Alan McOwan, \u201cYou\u2019re trying to win various battles. You have to keep clobbering it from every direction you can.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s true for coronavirus, he says, as well as for other viral conditions. An HIV specialist at London\u2019s 56 Dean Street sexual health clinic, McOwan sees similarities between Covid-19 and HIV. Both are viruses without a working vaccine, you can be infectious without knowing it, and both rely mostly on close human contact to spread.</p> <p>McOwan and his colleagues are not only interested in comparing the two viruses, but also in examining their interplay. Because while the spread of all infectious diseases, Covid included, is slowed by physical distancing, sexual health specialists believe the unique set of circumstances lockdown has created offers an unprecedented opportunity in the decades-long fight against HIV too.</p> <p>Since the run-up to the lockdown, clinicians at 56 Dean Street have closely monitored their new cases of gonorrhoea and prescriptions written for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), a treatment which, if taken within 72 hours of exposure to HIV, can stop the virus taking hold. On both fronts they have seen sharp declines.</p> <p>\u201cWe chose these two markers as they are things people would tend to not put off coming in for,\u201d says McOwan. \u201cIf you have gonorrhoea in your penis, it feels like you\u2019re peeing razor blades and you may have discharge within four to seven days. To be effective, PEP needs to be taken quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Their findings confirmed what health professionals nationwide had predicted: through complying with measures to physically distance, the public are having less \u201crisky\u201d unprotected sex with new partners. This alone has helped slow the rate of HIV transmission, but a prolonged period of sexual inactivity in Britain has other benefits in the attempt to slow new cases of HIV.</p> <p>People are most infectious in the earlier stages of contracting HIV, and therefore more likely to pass it on. Ordinarily, the viral load of HIV-positive people not on treatment is counted in the tens of thousands, while the figure for one patient of McOwan\u2019s who had recently contacted HIV was 520bn. \u201cAs very few people right now have recently caught HIV,\u201d says McOwan. \u201cThere are far fewer of those very infectious people around.\u201d</p> <p>Having already lasted seven weeks, the lockdown also mitigates one of the biggest challenges usually facing sexual health clinicians: it can take up to a month from potential exposure to HIV for current tests to return a definitive result. \u201cIf nobody has had sex which has put them at an HIV risk for at least four weeks,\u201d says McOwan, \u201cthere will be nobody in this blindspot who might otherwise be missed.\u201d</p> <p>When taking regular treatment, people who are HIV positive have an undetectable viral load and therefore cannot pass on the infection. New HIV infections had already been dropping nationally, in part because the NHS is increasing public access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a drug taken by HIV-negative people before and after sex that reduces the risk of getting HIV. In 2012, there were an estimated 2,800 new HIV diagnoses among men who have sex with men in the UK. In 2018 the figure was down to 800, a 71% fall.</p> <p>\u201cIf we can now find the remaining people with HIV through testing and put them on treatment,\u201d says McOwan, \u201cwe could remove anyone who is infectious from the population with long-lasting effects. We won\u2019t get this two-month window of no sex again.\u201d</p> <p>Similar successes could also be seen in other locked-down countries where testing and treatment is widely accessible. The New Zealand Aids Foundation has already contacted Dean Street, asking permission to replicate its campaign. This is an opportunity, McOwan says, that he and his colleagues are determined to \u201cgrab by the balls\u201d.</p> <p>Alongside the Terrence Higgins Trust and other organisations in the sector, the Dean Street team have been working to encourage anyone who might have been exposed to HIV since their last check-up to get tested before the lockdown is lifted. Their social media posts explaining how this period could \u201cbreak the chain\u201d have been their most ever shared.</p> <p>But this effort can only succeed if patients can access HIV testing before resuming normal sexual activity. Sexual health services are commissioned by local authorities rather than NHS England nationally, which means access to different testing methods depends on where a patient lives. Online, postal testing isn\u2019t always routinely available in all areas, and coronavirus has seen many standard face-to-face sexual health services closed while resources are redeployed.</p> <p>The results of a <a href=\"https://members.bashh.org/Documents/COVID-19/BASHH%20COVID-19%20Clinical%20Thermometer%20Survey%20-%20First%20Round%20Results%20Snapshot%20.pdf\">survey</a> conducted by the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, published in early April, found a quarter of responding medical practitioners could not offer patients access to online HIV testing. Over half reported having under 20% of their standard capacity to deliver face-to-face HIV services.</p> <p>\u201cWhere it\u2019s available online, postal testing has ramped up,\u201d says Dr Michael Brady, a consultant in sexual health and HIV at King\u2019s College Hospital, and medical director of the Terrence Higgins Trust. \u201cIn London, and in many other parts of the country, we have really good online testing services with capacity, but it\u2019s not uniform. There will be places which don\u2019t offer online testing or have a restrictive number of tests available, and there\u2019ll be a problem if in those places face-to-face services haven\u2019t yet opened up.\u201d</p> <p>While some clinics remain closed, many NHS trusts adapted their HIV testing to introduce online services and have informed frontline healthcare workers, but some have not. When the Guardian contacted a clinic within the Northumbria NHS trust to ask whether routine HIV testing was available, it was told that this would not currently be possible in person or online. A spokesperson for the trust later added that they were offering HIV testing, and that they are addressing the fact incorrect information was being provided.</p> <p>A clinician within the Sherwood Forest hospitals trust in Nottinghamshire similarly said testing was not available, although a spokesperson later confirmed testing was being done online.</p> <p>The advice from the experts is clear: lockdown has given us a once-in-a-lifetime chance to bring down new HIV transmissions; if you belong to an at-risk group and might have been exposed to the virus since you were last tested, <a href=\"https://freetesting.hiv/\">order </a><a href=\"https://freetesting.hiv/\">a test and take it now</a>.</p> <p>As it stands, however, not everyone can. And even when testing capacity is available, some clinics are apparently unaware.</p> <p>\u201cThe message about this unique opportunity is futile,\u201d says Brady, \u201cunless we ensure that postal tests are there for those who need them. If everyone is able to use their time in lockdown to test for HIV and know their status we could make significant advances towards ending HIV transmission in the UK.\u201d</p>",

An initial statement warning against excessive measures did not even include the word \u201cHungary\u201d, leading to Hungary itself eagerly adding its signature in support.</p> <p>Hungarian government officials have branded Thursday\u2019s hearing a \u201clynching\u201d and a \u201cwitchhunt\u201d, and Orb\u00e1n has said he is too busy to attend. \u201cIt\u2019s leftists and liberals playing politics when the continent is facing one of the greatest health and economic crises we\u2019ve seen in a century,\u201d Orb\u00e1n\u2019s spokesman, Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zoltanspox/status/1260497602983976962\">wrote</a> on Twitter on Wednesday.</p> <p>Orb\u00e1n has offered to send his justice minister, Judit Varga, to speak in his place, but the suggestion was rebuffed by David Sassoli, the parliament\u2019s president, who said only the president or prime minister could address the hearing.</p> <p>A parliament official told the Guardian that the Hungarian government would not be represented in the debate. \u201cHe [Orb\u00e1n] declined the invitation, and for us the case is closed.\u201d It is not clear what will happen if Varga travels to Brussels anyway.</p> <p>The European commission vice-president V\u0115ra Jourov\u00e1 will take part. The Czech politician caused delight among pro-government commentators in Budapest when she was reported as saying there was nothing of concern in the Hungarian laws, but in an interview over the weekend she denied making the comments and called the laws \u201cvery disturbing\u201d.

However, in recent days police have used it in a number of cases that have provoked criticism.</p> <p>On Tuesday police arrived at dawn with a search warrant at the home of a 64-year-old man in the town of Szerencs who had posted a Facebook status criticising the government\u2019s coronavirus response and called Orb\u00e1n a \u201ccruel tyrant\u201d.</p> <p>Although he was released without charge, a statement about the case on the police website said \u201ca malicious or ill-considered share on the internet could constitute a crime\u201d.

  "<p>Republicans appeared poised to win two congressional seats \u2013 one in Wisconsin and one in California \u2013 in special election races that are being watched closely as preludes to the general election in November as many states will move to mail-in voting amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>In Wisconsin, the Republican Tom Tiffany notched an easy victory, in a reliably red district. In California,<strong> </strong>early results indicated the Republican Mike Garcia is on track<strong> </strong>to retake a seat that Democrats had flipped in 2018. Both seats will be up for election again in November.</p> <p>The California vote was based almost entirely on mailed-in ballots, and the full results likely won\u2019t be clear for days. Officials will accept ballots postmarked by election day, even if they arrive up to three days later.</p> <p>Whoever wins the California special election would fill the seat of the former US representative Katie Hill, who resigned amid scandal in late 2019. The circumstances of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/30/katie-hill-resignation-activists-vow-fight-female-democrat\">Hill\u2019s resignation</a> \u2013 she quit amid allegations that she had an affair with a staffer, and after private photos of her had been published online without her consent \u2013 had brought national attention to the race. Donald Trump, who endorsed Garcia and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/12/trump-foreshadows-how-he-could-undermine-presidential-election\">alleged that the election was \u201crigged\u201d</a> because of the opening of a new voting center in the district, also ensured that the race was closely watched, especially by Democrats who believed it would be a referendum on the president.</p> <p>On Wednesday morning,<strong> </strong>Garcia, a former navy fighter pilot, was ahead of the Democratic California state legislator Christy Smith by 55.9% to 44.1%, preliminary results from the California secretary of state\u2019s office said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is looking extremely good,\u201d Garcia said on a conference call. \u201cI won\u2019t give a victory speech tonight. We\u2019ll save that for hopefully tomorrow night as the data comes in.\u201d</p> <p>Smith earned the endorsements of Barack Obama and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Hill\u2019s unpopularity in the district, post-scandal, had been a hurdle for her campaign. Prior to the election, the <a href=\"https://cookpolitical.com/analysis/house/california-house/ca-25-race-replace-katie-hill-moves-lean-democratic-toss\">Cook Political Report</a> changed its assessment of the race from \u201clean Democratic\u201d to a \u201ctossup\u201d as the pandemic shut down traditional campaigning through door-knocking and town halls.</p> <p>Regardless of the outcome, Democrats are hopeful about Smith\u2019s chances in the November election. \u201cThe electorate will be very different then,\u201d said Rose Kapolczynski, a Democratic strategist based in Los Angeles. \u201cAnd I still think Smith will have a strong chance.\u201d</p> <p>It is wise to avoid projecting too much about the November elections based on this race, said Paul Mitchell, with the campaign research firm Political Data Inc. \u201cTo do so would be like predicting the championship based on the results of two-on-two basketball game before the finals,\u201d Mitchell said.</p> <p>Traditionally, older, white, and Republican voters are overrepresented in special elections, Mitchell said. Younger and minority voters, who lean Democratic, are more likely to vote in larger numbers in November.</p> <p>In Wisconsin, Tiffany, a state senator endorsed by Trump, easily won a special congressional election in a heavily conservative, rural Wisconsin district. But Democrats are likely to watch his margin of victory \u2013 and consider it evidence of that party\u2019s gains if Tiffany\u2019s opponent Tricia Zunker performs better than the 20-point defeat the Democrats faced in district in 2018. Preliminary results show Tiffany leading by 14 points.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/05/donald-trump-coronavirus-economic-recovery\">Trump gives up on virus fight to focus on economic recovery \u2013\u00a0and re-election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFor Trump to win re-election, red areas have to get redder to balance out blue areas getting bluer,\u201c said the Wisconsin Democratic party spokeswoman, Courtney Beyer.</p> <p>But Tiffany dismissed the argument. \u201cAny time you lose by 14 points, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a moral victory,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a decisive victory here.\u201d</p> <p>Tiffany will replace the former reality TV star Sean Duffy, a Republican who retired in September. The district has been vacant since Duffy\u2019s retirement.</p> <p>Zunker, the president of the Wausau school board, was trying to become the first Native American from Wisconsin elected to Congress. She pulled in big-name endorsements including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, but the numbers were against her. The district has been under Republican control since 2011 and was redistricted to more heavily favor Republicans.</p>",
  "<p>After two months of quarantine, we all start to dream about breaking free from our perfect little prison. Amid the endless days and nights of impending doom, whose thoughts have not turned to the place that gives us the most hope?</p> <p>How can you not yearn to swap the relentless grind of this Groundhog Day for the sun-filled uplands of your own happy place?</p> <p>Your dream destination might be a Caribbean beach or simply a local bar. But for Donald Trump, his Shangri-La is that corner of the 2016 election when he was just an honest grifter screaming conspiracy theories at Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>His love boat has one port of call, far away from a pandemic and recession: a place they call Obamagate.</p> <p>What is this wonderland where our impeached president can finally kick back? It is a place where the corrupt are cleansed, and the cops are all crooked; where tainted elections are purified by the sheep dip of Fox News; where former presidents are mentioned far more than pandemics.</p> <p>But what, exactly, did the last president do, beyond wearing a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/08/28/tan-suit-scandal-obama-trump/\">tan</a> suit, that could possibly earn him the dreaded suffix applied to every scandal from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/25/ariana-grande-donut-licking-white-house-gala\">Donutgate</a> to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2013/02/26/172982758/pastagate-quebec-agency-criticized-for-targeting-foreign-words-on-menus\">Pastagate</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/feb/21/sutton-united-wayne-shaw-fa-betting-rules\">multiple</a> <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/white-house-press-secretary-sarah-huckabee-sanders-ends-piegate/\">Piegates</a>?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been going on for a long time,\u201d our presidential Gandalf told reporters on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s been going on from before I even got elected. And it\u2019s a disgrace that it happened. And if you look at what\u2019s gone on, and if you look at, now, all of this information that\u2019s being released \u2013 and from what I understand, that\u2019s only the beginning \u2013 some terrible things happened, and it should never be allowed to happen in our country again.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, but, what exactly is Obamagate? Apart from the most terribly terrible thing that disgracefully disgraced this country a long, long time ago, in ways that should never, ever, happen to anyone. Oh no.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be seeing what\u2019s going on over the next \u2013 over the coming weeks,\u201d he continued, like the all-seeing, all-knowing troll he truly is. \u201cBut I \u2013 and I wish you\u2019d write honestly about it, but unfortunately, you choose not to do so.\u201d</p> <p>This cruel, cruel world is so unjust. Why can\u2019t people choose to write honestly about all this dishonesty?</p> <p>But honestly, what exactly is this mysteriously epic crime that is about to engulf the ex-president we shall now call Barack Obamagate?</p> <p>\u201cYou know what the crime is,\u201d Trump said, slapping down yet another pesky reporter. \u201cThe crime is very obvious to everybody. All you have to do is read the newspapers. Except yours.\u201d</p> <p>Read any one of the newspapers, except that one. And the other one. Yeah, that\u2019s right. Not that one either. You should skip over this rag, too.</p> <p>There\u2019s always the Epoch Times (motto: \u201cTruth and Tradition\u201d) of course. But frankly you need to go to a really trusted news source like One America News, Trump\u2019s new best friend in news, since Fox News turned <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/04/13/forced-choose-between-trump-fox-who-would-presidents-base-pick/\">weird</a> by asking questions about all its geriatric viewers dying from the coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cWatching <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FoxNews\">@FoxNews</a> on weekend afternoons is a total waste of time,\u201d tweeted our commander-in-chief in the middle of the pandemic. \u201cWe now have some great alternatives, like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OANN\">@OANN</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Thank goodness he can watch the TV at weekends without totally wasting everyone\u2019s time. Because only One America \u2013 not the other America of truth and the rule of law \u2013 had the courage to ask about a possible justice department investigation into all those Obama officials who were mysteriously present at the start of the Russia investigation.</p> <p>Kayleigh McEnany, the new White House press secretary, is nobody\u2019s fool. She couldn\u2019t possibly comment on a justice department matter like that. But as it happens, she had plenty to say about the transcripts the justice department is reviewing, which is totally different.</p> <p>\u201cThis president was exonerated by the Mueller reports,\u201d McEnany declared, \u201cand there are some real questions for these individuals who are saying one thing publicly and another thing privately.\u201d</p> <p>Damn right, Kayleigh. Why didn\u2019t these Obama people know everything that Robert Mueller uncovered after almost two years of investigation? They admitted they didn\u2019t have the evidence Mueller did. It\u2019s so obviously fishy.</p> <p>It\u2019s like saying it\u2019s safe to open up the country in the middle of a pandemic but insisting on daily tests for White House staff behind closed doors. It\u2019s like telling everyone else to wear a mask while refusing to wear one yourself. You can\u2019t say one thing publicly and another thing privately.</p> <p>Now there are some people who fear this kind of game is going to lead to something desperate, like indicting a former president or his senior aides. After all, a justice department that just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/michael-flynn-criminal-case-trump-russia\">dropped</a> the case against Michael Flynn \u2013 who pleaded guilty in open court \u2013 has no core belief in justice.</p> <p>But that\u2019s not the point of this malarkey. This is Hunter Bidengate and Clinton emailgate. This is smeargate and distractgate. You should probably showergate after reading this.</p> <p>Trump has many good reasons to sail away to the land of smears. They\u2019re called the polls, and they are \u2013 for the sociopath sitting in the White House \u2013 even worse reading than the pandemic death tolls or the latest unemployment claims. Trump is <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/florida/\">losing</a> to Joe Biden by three points in Florida in the most recent Fox News poll, where he was supposed to have a lock on his re-election from his Mar-a-Lago mothership.</p> <p>That\u2019s on top of polls showing Michigan and Pennsylvania moving <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/\">decisively</a> against him, and Senate race polls turning <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/florida/\">close states</a> like Colorado and North Carolina into Democratic blowouts.</p> <p>In his hour of need, Trump wants us to forget about the lack of testing, tracing, vaccines and treatment. He wants us to proclaim Mission Accomplished and move on. He wants us to say things are bad, but they could be worse.</p> <p>If only something were worse than 80,000 dead Americans and almost 30 million unemployed. But nothing comes close to all those lost weeks and months when Trump ignored the pandemic, failed to prepare for the worst, and pretended like it was no big deal.</p> <p>Not an imaginary scandal that cannot be described, about a defunct investigation that pulled its punches. Not the desperately kooky Ukraine corruption that led to his very real impeachment. Nothing compares to Trumpgate.</p>",

inquiry was first proposed in March just days after 10,000 victims of the Morrison government\u2019s cruel robodebt scheme signed up to a class action to defend their legal rights.</p> \n   <p>Contrary to government claims, research by commercial law firm Allens found the total number of class action filings was actually down 20% in 2019. </p> \n   <p>Shareholder actions were actually down 63% and so far this year there are just three new shareholder cases \u2013 none of which relate to Covid-19 matters.</p> \n   <p>Significantly, the biggest cause of new cases in 2019 came from

question time, <strong>Tony Burke </strong>had a \u2018personal explanation\u2019 to make and spills some tea about the weekly meetings the opposition leadership has been having with the government leadership (which was the compromise offered after Anthony Albanese was denied a seat on the national cabinet, and the parliament wasn\u2019t sitting). After this, I am not sure if those weekly catch-ups will be ongoing.</p> \n  <p>Asked if he had claimed to have been misrepresented (the standard reason for a personal explanation), Burke says he does:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Yesterday during debate on an amendment I had moved, which would have demanded the government produce the new sitting calendar, the leader of the House (Christian Porter) said statements I had personally made were inaccurate, by claiming that in private meetings, which I had personally attended, the government had, and I quote the leader of the House, \u2018clearly explained there will be additional sitting weeks\u2019, end quote.</p> \n   <p>This statement is false.</p> \n   <p>While I would normally not disclose the conduct of private meetings, given the leader of the House has made this false statement about me to the House, I wish to confirm the following four points.</p> \n   <p>One, in the meeting with the leadership of the government, on 7 May 2020, the government did not state that it would provide additional sitting weeks, but merely that it might.</p> \n   <p>Two, this was to be based on an assessment, that was to be taken, and I quote, \u2018a couple of days\u2019, end quote, after parliament had risen, based on whether there had been an outbreak of Covid-19 as a result of these sittings.</p> \n   <p>Three, given the virus has an incubation period of weeks not days, this position was always absurd. </p> \n   <p>Four, the minister\u2019s misrepresentation of these statements also presumes the government has been forthcoming with accurate information at these meetings, which is challenged by the fact that on issues as straightforward as whether there would be changes to jobkeeper, the government has provided information at these meetings which was proven to be false the very next day.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

And so any suggestion that Australia\u2019s agricultural exports are the subject of government subsidisation is rejected. </p> \n   <p>And these are the points that we make directly as part of a comprehensive and strategic partnership that was concluded many years ago and we are continuing to use the channels of that relationship and that partnership to be able to progress those matters as well as directly with the relevant authorities in China regarding their anti-dumping review in relation to barley. </p> \n   <p>Similarly, relations in matter to abattoirs are important to progress. They relate to what is claimed to be paperwork and administration issues in relation to Australian meat exports and we will continue to advocate and set out the Australian case clearly.</p> \n   <p>Let me be clear about one thing. Australia stands firmly behind our agricultural producers and we stand firmly about where we see the role of the Australian economy in the broader world. We have great confidence in our outlook as a trading nation and we engage with all partners in good faith with the purpose of ensuring the increasing global trade.</p> \n   <p>That is the basis for our relationship the Chinese government when it comes to a comprehensive strategic partnership.

In relation to mental health and the coronavirus epidemic in Australia, in particular we have invested $669m in telehealth of which I\u2019m advised 47.7% of all consultations in the previous week with regards to standard mental health items were conducted over the phone. </p> \n   <p>In addition to that, what we have also seen is that general telehealth items have very significantly been for mental health. </p> \n   <p>So it doesn\u2019t have to be confined to the particular mechanism which the member outlines. </p> \n   <p>What we have opened up with telehealth is a much broader ability to access services in conjunction with the services provided through telehealth, we have also made sure that there were psychological and psychiatric items that were also made available. On top of that, there was a $74m investment focusing on support services for people, mostly online or through telehealth, through organisations such as the Black Dog Institute for healthcare workers, Origin for young people, Lifeline, Kids Line, so many other different support groups. And in particular, Beyond Blue has led the coronavirus activity. </p> \n   <p>So with to other proposals, the government will always consider them. What we have done already is on the advice of the mental health officers, the chief medical officer, in particular the chair \u2013 or CEO \u2013 of the National Mental Health Commission and the prime minister\u2019s suicide prevention adviser, Christine Morgan, establish the arrangements which are in place. These have been critical to help save lives and protect lives during what is a difficult period and where there are proposals we\u2019d always review them. </p> \n   <p>What we have done so far, I would say, is potentially world leading and in particular the national cabinet will be considering the national mental health pandemic plan this week and we are making very good process with the states and I want to thank the prime minister for his support and his leadership in drawing that into the national cabinet.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\"

<p>The Greens are getting louder in the calls to have parliament return as usual ahead of August. It was adjourned until August at the last emergency sitting, but given that the government is attempting to reopen the economy, it kinda has to reopen parliament too. So that\u2019s why we are here in this sitting, which <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> called a \u201ctrial\u201d, but is actually just parliament (trials are not a thing with parliament. It either sits or it doesn\u2019t and the parliament decides how it makes that happen.) </p> \n  <p>Yesterday <strong>Christian Porter</strong> said a revised sitting calendar was being worked on to bring back parliament ahead of the August scheduled sitting, but there has been no word on when that will be made public. </p> \n  <p><strong>Larissa Waters</strong> says parliament needs to be recalled after this sitting as soon as possible. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Covid crisis response and the plan for recovery demand more transparency in government decision-making. The Senate Covid committee plays a critical role, but is no substitute for full parliamentary oversight. </p> \n   <p>We need more democracy during this time, not less. We need to ensure that Australia\u2019s recovery is fair, effective, and guided by expert advice. We need parliament to return.</p> \n   <p>The Greens are calling for both houses to sit in June to fix gaps in the jobkeeper scheme, introduce rights to pandemic leave, consider banking royal commission legislation, and debate the merits of the government\u2019s proposed gas-led recovery.</p> \n   <p>We must ensure we don\u2019t come out the other side having brought this coronovirus under control but finding ourselves with our democracy eroded and hard-fought for rights lost.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T03:20:19.969Z\">at 4.20am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebb65768f08a55ecde58def\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/paul-karp\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T03:12:25.829Z\">4.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Community and Public Sector Union \u2013 which represents non-academic staff at unis \u2013 is pretty annoyed about a deal between the NTEU and management allowing pay cuts.</p> \n  <p><strong>Troy Wright</strong>, the CPSU NSW assistant general secretary, said the deal was \u201ccooked up behind closed doors between academics and universities\u201d and will cut pay, particularly for the lowest paid staff. </p> \n  <p>He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>A 15% wage cut may only be a haircut for high-paid academics, but for the professional staff of universities it is a life-altering cut to their pay packet.</em></p> \n   <p><em>There are a range of smarter cost saving measures universities could take before an indiscriminate slash to wages.

However, the fact is that the decision on Chinese tariffs will be based on an anti-dumping investigation into Australia\u2019s exported barley that has been ongoing for almost 18 months.</p> \n   <p><strong>If anything, Australia\u2019s worries over potential tariffs underline the anxiety surrounding deteriorating China-Australia relations. Since China-US relations hit their lowest point in decades amid the Covid-19 crisis, relations between China and Australia have been heading in the same direction. Australian politicians have made no secret of their desire to follow the US, joining in on the China blame game. If China-US ties continue to deteriorate, the uncertainty surrounding China-Australia relations will also increase.<br></strong></p> \n   <p><strong>Such uncertainty will inevitably lead to economic repercussions. In this sense, it now seems necessary to advise Chinese people and companies to watch out for potential risks when it comes to doing business with or studying in Australia.</strong><br></p> \n   <p><strong>Fundamentally speaking, it is not in the interests of people in China and Australia if the latter\u2019s politicians continue to take unfriendly actions and launch political attacks on the former. China-US relations are now in trouble, and if Australia chooses to follow, that would not only negatively impact its relations with China but would also come at the cost of its own economy and trade.</strong><br></p> \n   <p>In fact, the importance of China to Australia\u2019s economy may be far greater than some Australian politicians estimate. China is Australia\u2019s largest export destination, with exports to China accounting for about one third of its total exports. China is the main buyer of Australia\u2019s commodities, farm products and education services.<br></p> \n   <p>There is a need for Australia to reposition its role in regional geopolitics rather than becoming the lapdog of the US. It needs to rethink its relationships with the US and China at this juncture. Given its economic ties with Asian countries are closer than those it has with western nations, it may be more in its interests to focus on how to further integrate into the Asian industrial chain.<br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-12T23:11:33.123Z\">at 12.11am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebb25548f080c7274539c12\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-12T22:44:58.866Z\">11.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Amid all this, the Eden-Monaro byelection is still to be scheduled.</p> \n  <p>Labor isn\u2019t messing around \u2013 <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> will be out there this morning, with the party\u2019s candidate, <strong>Kristy McBain</strong>, and <strong>Catherine King</strong> for a doorstop at Murrumbateman.</p> \n  <p>But then Labor can do that \u2013 it has a candidate.

In honour of the composer\u2019s 90th birthday, Streep charmed everyone. It wasn\u2019t just her earrings (vintage-looking, fabulous), her martini (the classy choice for heavy drinking, don\u2019t @ me) and her bathrobe (bow down) but the bookshelves behind, bare save for a wooden duck of the generic seaside-gift-shop variety \u2013 less an objet, more an afterthought. No Oscars. No colour-coded books. So relatable. A quarantined audience fell in love with Streep all over again. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cb82765ddc711e230a26e6e516dd33cc9721714\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cb82765ddc711e230a26e6e516dd33cc9721714/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Wintour with dark glasses and drawn curtains in Vogue Global Conversations.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna Wintour with dark glasses and drawn curtains in Vogue Global Conversations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vogue YouTube channel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anna Wintour\u2019s Zoom backdrop, by contrast, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kx3_EjDCQ68&amp;feature=youtu.be\">has not been as scrupulously curated as one would expect</a> from one the most valuable personal brands in Manhattan.

Through a hodgepodge of laws and executive orders, at least 21 states have granted some form of civil immunity to healthcare providers, according to a tally sent to the Guardian by National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care \u2013 though in a few cases it is not clear if the immunity extends to nursing homes.</p> <p>Smith Sloan wrote: \u201cStates recognize that providers require legal protection as a result of actions related to combating the Covid-19 pandemic. LeadingAge \u2026 is pursuing protections on the federal level with a coalition asking for uniform and consistent relief as well.\u201d</p> <p>Some states are including immunity from criminal liability, but policies do generally make exceptions for especially egregious treatment, including willful misconduct or gross negligence.</p> <p>Richard Mollot, executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition, said: \u201cTo basically take away the one area of potential accountability when residents are most vulnerable to me is dumbfounding and dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>For some public health experts, however, the issue is not so cut and dried. They describe nursing homes as a sector in chronic need of reform that is nevertheless \u201cthe safety net of the safety net\u201d for vulnerable people.</p> <p>Experts acknowledge that the industry is filled with deficiencies, and is based upon a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/business/nursing-homes-care-corporate.html\">broken business model</a> that struggles in the face of a pandemic. But they also say nursing homes have been under-prioritized by officials in a public health crisis that has disproportionately targeted their patient populations.</p> <p>Michael L Barnett, a professor at the Harvard school of public health, said: \u201cPutting a nursing home out of business because somebody died is really punishing at the wrong level, because certainly there are nursing homes that probably did not act responsibly, or they may have ignored the threat.

The wire was <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/EUR0325442015ENGLISH.PDF\">first installed in 2005</a>, removed two years later and restored by the centre-right government of Mariano Rajoy in 2013. The socialist government led by Pedro Sanchez had a chance to make good on repeated promises of a more humanitarian migration policy after June 2018. And throughout 2018 and 2019, Spanish officials stated their determination to remove the razor wire and, <a href=\"https://elpais.com/politica/2019/12/03/actualidad/1575392092_094935.html\">in the words of</a> the interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, move beyond \u201cbloody methods\u201d of border control. <br></p> <p> Spain\u2019s humanitarian policy has become largely redundant, though, given that Moroccan authorities have <a href=\"https://www.abc.es/espana/abci-marruecos-concluye-valla-concertinas-para-dejar-interior-retire-ceuta-201910270229_noticia.html\">started installing razor wire </a> along their own border fence with Ceuta.

At home, it\u2019s about drones, surveillance and technical cooperation to identify migrants approaching the EU border before they even reach it. Meanwhile, violent border policing is kept farther afield: out of sight, out of mind. So the Moroccans build an \u2018ugly\u2019 fence which can be criticised, while the Spanish create a more \u2018humanitarian\u2019 alternative,\u201d says Kopp.</p> <p>Public pressure elsewhere has led some governments to reconsider the use of razor wire as experts brand it both inhumane and ineffective. Others even wonder about the legality of its use.<br><br>\u201cOn the one hand, legislation about borders states that crossing anywhere other than an official checkpoint is illegal. On the other hand, the notion of crossing a border illegally is usually voided under international refugee law if making an asylum claim,\u201d says Bernd Kasparek, a researcher at <a href=\"https://bordermonitoring.eu/\">Border Monitoring</a>, a German NGO that tracks pushbacks of refugees. \u201cSo there is a legal tension at the EU\u2019s borders. Sometimes it is very necessary to cross the border irregularly in order to lodge an asylum claim. Fortified borders like these interfere with that legal right, particularly in places where it\u2019s an open secret that 99% of asylum claims lodged with border guards are rejected,\u201d Kasparek adds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9fe8c821729a2a41b0fe609cae35d800d548c2d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fe8c821729a2a41b0fe609cae35d800d548c2d4/0_0_3840_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dead animal caught in razor wire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An animal is killed on a fence built to keep out migrants in Slovenia.

In Slovenia, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/11/balkan-wildlife-faces-extinction-threat-from-border-fence-to-control-migrants\">environmentalists\u2019 fears</a> of the impact of razor wire on wildlife led in 2016 to the removal of the coils from sections of its border with Croatia. In light of legal constraints in several European states on the deployment of razor wire in rural areas, some manufacturers <a href=\"https://www.gcmetal.pl/en/border-fence-iii/\">even indicate</a> the wildlife-friendly credentials of their razor wire.</p> <p>One difficulty in mounting a challenge is the near impossibility of establishing the true scale of the injuries inflicted specifically by razor wire at borders. According to Kate Dearden, project officer at the I nternational Organization for Migration\u2019s <a href=\"https://missingmigrants.iom.int/\">Missing Migrants Project</a>, many governments only keep records on deaths at borders, rather than deaths that occur later as a result of injuries during attempts to cross them. </p> <p>Moreover, it can be hard to discover exactly which portions of Europe\u2019s fences are topped by razor wire and who supplied it; in recent years many governments have classified detailed information about fences as state security issues. Nevertheless, some manufacturers have refused to sell to border fences on humanitarian grounds. In 2015, Talat Deger, director of the Berlin-based company Mutanox, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/german-companies-refuse-to-sell-razor-wire-for-hungarys-anti-refugee-fence-a6668296.html\">refused</a> to do a deal with the Hungarian government. In an interview last year, Deger\u2019s successor, Efekan Dikici, said that he and his staff have kept to the principle.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to sell razor wire, of course, but only for the right purposes: to secure property, factories, jails, or for example on the railings of ships to prevent piracy. For those purposes it\u2019s justified; but when it\u2019s being used against humans who need help, that\u2019s awkward,\u201d said Dikici. \u201cMost of our workers have a foreign background themselves, so I think we all feel this a bit more.\u201d <br>That stance is costly. Dikici stressed that it can be genuinely difficult for razor wire suppliers to establish the end use of their product, given that they often deal with middlemen and procurement agencies. \u201cIf you\u2019re selling to a government, razor wire could be used for a prison or a border. But if a request for a really huge amount comes in, we do wonder whether it\u2019s for a border fence. Even large private properties need a few hundred metres, not kilometres. I ask myself, if we got a request from the US for the Mexico border, would we give them a quote?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7064d3d46084260980e23cc9945a1d96431443db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7064d3d46084260980e23cc9945a1d96431443db/0_0_3100_2123/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Syrian migrants clamber under a razor-wire fence\" width=\"1000\" height=\"685\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Syrian migrants clamber under a razor-wire fence into Hungary at the border with Serbia, near Roszke, August 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bernadett Szabo/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other companies do not appear to have these scruples \u2013 after all, there is a brisk trade to be done in razor wire, which is not to be confused with barbed wire. Razor wire is cut from single sheets of galvanised steel, and most commonly sold in folding coils known in the industry as concertinas. The sharp razors come in various sizes; most seen by the Guardian at four European border fences are of the BTO-22, BTO-20 and BTO-10 varieties \u2013 straight razor edges affixed to a metal coil.</p> <p>There are even more formidable options: CBT-60 includes \u201charpoon\u201d style hooked razor heads that can embed themselves in the flesh of those trying to cross them. Some razor wire manufacturers seemingly flaunt the effects in their brochures; for example, Chinese manufacturer Hebei Jinshi <a href=\"https://www.razorbarbedwirefence.com/pdf/concertina-razor-wire-brochure.pdf\">advertises</a> its CBT-65 long blade as a \u201cvicious product\u201d whose \u201cextra long blade razors produce[s] [a] frightening effect.\u201d</p> <p>However, some European producers have discovered that selling razor wire to border fences comes at the cost of bad press, even in times of rising xenophobic sentiment.<br><br>When Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, decreed in 2015 that a fence be raised on Hungary\u2019s border with Serbia, the Malaga-based manufacturer <a href=\"http://concertina.es/en/\">European Security Fencing</a> (ESF) provided the razor wire. ESF, a subdivision of Mora Salazar, has delivered coils for fences in Austria, Slovenia, Bulgaria and France, and proudly presents itself as one of Europe\u2019s leading razor wire suppliers.</p> <p>Nevertheless, after the installation of its razor wire on the Hungarian border, ESF spokesmen told the Spanish press that they had been unaware of the product\u2019s final use by the Hungarian clients. In September 2015, the company <a href=\"https://www.eldiario.es/desalambre/concertinas-valla-Hungria-refugiados-Spain_0_431507330.html\">deleted its official Twitter account</a> following the backlash provoked by a tweet boasting of ESF\u2019s leading role in the European razor wire industry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"83cf9636445169459ca1f0e15bb0a8f7700c7b08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83cf9636445169459ca1f0e15bb0a8f7700c7b08/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alain Diabanza\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alain Diabanza, a former refugee from the Democratic Republic of the Congo who now teaches in Spain, at the razor-wire fence in Ceuta, Spain\u2019s north African territory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juan Medina/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today, ESF appears to have competition in the form of Polish company GC Metal, which now refers to itself as Europe\u2019s leading seller of razor wire. The company\u2019s website <a href=\"https://www.gcmetal.pl/en/securing-the-border/\">indicates</a> that it may have been involved in supplying concertina wire for the Bulgarian-Turkish border fence. Neither ESF nor GC Metal responded to requests for comment about the end use of their products or their humanitarian implications. <br><br>Europe\u2019s fortified borders are here to stay, even if borders in decades to come may be unrecognisable in comparison to today\u2019s crude fences. Razor wire, much like fortified borders in general, is both inhumane and ineffective, concludes Kopp, though its removal may not necessarily be a bellwether for a more humanitarian migration policy. Seismic sensors, night vision cameras and <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/05/11/drones-artificial-intelligence-europe-roborder/\">surveillance drones</a> have all come to play a greater role in border policing \u2013 with hi-tech solutions like these, will razor wire become redundant?</p> <p><br>\u201cThere\u2019s a high symbolic value to razor wire, like fences,\u201d says Mark Akkerman, a researcher at the Transnational Institute and author of a <a href=\"https://www.tni.org/files/publication-downloads/business_of_building_walls_-_full_report.pdf\">recent report</a> on Europe\u2019s border-industrial complex. \u201cSimply put, they allow governments to show the public, the press, their voters, and the world that they\u2019re \u2018doing something\u2019 about migration.\u201d</p> <p><br>\u2022 Maxim Edwards is a Berlin-based editor at GlobalVoices</p>",

This business operates with very little regard to cost because they\u2019re all about winning.\u201d</p> <p>Zimbalist also serves on the board of directors of <a href=\"https://www.thedrakegroup.org/\">the Drake Group</a>, an influential group of academics who have researched the role of college athletics. The group is calling for salary freezes for coaches, as well as a suspension of bonuses. Pointing to Iowa State\u2019s decisions as an example, the group said in a statement, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thedrakegroup.org/2020/04/11/coronavirus-crisis-and-financial-issues-in-college-athletics-what-do-we-do-now/\">this is the right thing to do</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Internally, there is a consensus that pay cuts are in the crosshairs, even if many prominent coaches or schools have yet to step forward. <a href=\"https://lead1association.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/LEAD1.TW-COVID-19-Impact-eBook-FINAL.pdf\">An April survey of athletic directors nationwide conducted by LEAD1</a>, an organization of athletic department executives, found that 67% of athletic directors \u201cagree or strongly agree\u201d with limiting current compensation. (An anonymous quote from one of the survey respondents said, \u201ceveryone loves socialism on college campuses but in athletic departments it is straight capitalism.\u201d) More than half of those surveyed said that their departments did not \u201chave a financial reserve that could aid in this type of crisis.\u201d</p> <p>The economics of college sports are often more complicated than in professional leagues. For example, revenue from big ticket programs such as football or basketball may help fund smaller college sports. That means if income from football or basketball falls, depending on the school, it may jeopardize sports such as rowing, wrestling or field hockey. What\u2019s more, many college sports rely on student fees, which could crater this coming academic year amid the pandemic. While TV deals funnel millions into college athletic coffers, so, too, do ticket sales and <a href=\"http://blogs.shu.edu/sportspoll/2020/04/09/nearly-3-of-4-americans-say-they-wont-attend-games-without-coronavirus-vaccine-developed/\">in a early-April poll from Seton Hall</a>, nearly three out of four fans said they wouldn\u2019t return to live sports events without a vaccine.</p> <p>Just as many institutions, once slow to change, have now had to rapidly revamp due to Covid-19, critics argue that the pandemic may expedite a reckoning that had been long underway. Before the coronavirus hit, Democratic congresswoman Donna Shalala <a href=\"https://shalala.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2275\">introduced federal legislation that would limit high college coach salaries</a>. And, after years of fighting in and out of courtrooms, the NCAA may finally be budging on <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-sports/story/_/id/29083196/the-ncaa-again-put-athletes-first-nil-debate\">whether athletes can profit off of the use of their likenesses</a>.</p> <p>The pandemic has also brought to light the lack of union representation college players have, compared with their counterparts in the MLB, NFL, NHL, WNBA and NBA. Not only can college athletes not collectively negotiate with schools for terms to return to stadiums, but schools may face massive liabilities in putting students on the field prematurely, officials said. The general thinking is that unless students are back on campuses, it will be hard to have them back on the playing field.</p> <p>The pay cut is a luxury the players don\u2019t have because they don\u2019t make a salary anyway. \u201cPerhaps this is an opportunity for some necessary cultural change for how we think about student athletes,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.ursinus.edu/live/profiles/669-jasmine-harris\">Jasmine Harris</a>, a sociology professor at Ursinus College who has studied student athletes, says.</p> <p>\u201cEspecially in men\u2019s basketball and football, the discussion [about money] is always bound in family,\u201d Harris adds. \u201c\u2018We all belong to the same banner and so we are taking care of each other.\u2019 That kind of rhetoric has been used for the last 20 years or so as one of the many reasons people give for not paying the student athletes, that it takes away from that idea that we\u2019re here as comrades and as peers and as potential future alumni. \u2018We\u2019re rallying together around that.\u2019 Well, where\u2019s the rallying together when the university has lost $35m in eight weeks? Especially if you\u2019re one of those coaches in that greater-than-$5m salary range who has been making that amount of money for a significant amount of time?\u201d</p> <p>The current questioning of coaches\u2019 financial value may also bring a reckoning for other athletic expenditures, Fritz G Polite, assistant vice president of opportunity development at the Harry F Byrd, Jr School of Business at Shenandoah University, says. The arms race of gleaming stadiums and athletic facilities, as well as adjacent coaching staffs may be cut, as well.</p> <p>And in a best case scenario, it may put more of the \u201ccollege\u201d back into college sports, Polite says.</p> <p>\u201cI think that people get caught up in the Kool Aid,\u201d Polite says. \u201cThe true essence of higher education really should be about the academic enterprise. The athletic enterprise has co-opted the academic side.\u201d</p> <p>Polite cites the coming together of the NBA and the NFL to raise funds for Covid-19 causes, even as their seasons seem to be on pause, as a model for college coaches going forward.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see the athletic directors and coaches come together to create a unified movement to support the millions of people who are currently unemployed,\u201d Polite says. \u201cAnd support this country that\u2019s in a dire time of need right now ... I\u2019d like to see these coaches say, \u2018We get it, and we\u2019d like to make a donation and we\u2019re going to raise $50m and give it to the food banks of America.\u2019 That\u2019s what I would like to see, some social responsibility from these multi-million dollar coaches and athletic directors.\u201d<br></p>",

  "<p>\u201cDoes anyone know of a private Covid antibody test that is properly reliable?\u201d asked one of my friends on WhatsApp.</p> \n<p>The question made me curious. Having antibodies, of course, means you\u2019ve been exposed to the virus and you\u2019re unlikely to spread it. But with false negatives and positives, it\u2019s no guarantee and you\u2019d still want to keep a distance from vulnerable people. Also no one knows how long the immunity lasts.</p> \n<p>At the moment, the only tests available to ordinary people are commercial kits on sale over the internet. I had a quick rummage online and it looked like some may now have regulatory approval. But are they really any good? How do they work? How much does it cost? And will I feel impregnable if I get a positive answer?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"28f9c4c8-d8b6-4f17-bdd6-1264330215a7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/akiXEfWW-V0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It goes against the grain to shell out \u00a3100 (\u00a3160 if you add same-day delivery within the M25) for a private test of uncertain provenance, quality, reliability and significance. But I ordered one to road test it. After a bit of a kerfuffle, a cheerful bike courier (helmet, no mask or gloves, hadn\u2019t had the test himself because \u201cit costs too much for me\u201d) delivered the elegantly boxed kit and waited patiently for me to do it. I may be a doctor but I found it very tricky. I tried to follow the written instructions but if you\u2019re not a natural Ikea assembler, you may struggle as I did. You use a lancet to prick your finger and milk 10 drops of blood into a tube. I\u2019m embarrassed to admit that I filled it from the wrong end \u2013 not realising that you had to take the top off first. I couldn\u2019t get enough blood out of my chubby fingertips \u2013 even after four attempts. Luckily my GP partner arrived, shoved a needle into a vein in my arm and we filled the tube from the right end. By this time, the puncture sites in my fingertips had started dripping and there was blood all over the place. I felt like an idiot.</p> \n<p>The results will be ready in a couple of days but, in the meantime, if I have any Covid questions or feel unwell, I should call NHS 111 according to the kit supplier\u2019s website. This default setting by the private sector always makes me smile wryly. To be fair, the company I used is offering a discount to NHS staff \u2013 although I\u2019m not sure that this absolves them of a duty of care to the consumer.</p> \n<p>The test claims that it has \u201cdemonstrated specificity and sensitivity of greater than 99% 14 days or more after symptoms started\u201d. This means that it is unlikely to give a false positive or negative result. It has been certified for use by the EU and is undergoing validation testing in the UK by public health organisations. It tests for immunoglobulin G, the antibody that rises more slowly after infection but stays around longer in the body \u2013 hence the 14-day lag. Kits that include immunoglobulin M, which is the antibody that appears more quickly after infection, are also becoming available.</p> \n<p>Authorities including the US Food and Drug Administration are giving <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-voices/insight-fdas-revised-policy-antibody-tests-prioritizing-access-and-accuracy\">emergency use authorisation</a> to get more antibody testing kits on to the market to answer the all important questions: what percentage of the population has been exposed to the virus; does the presence of antibodies confer immunity; and, if so, for how long? And antibody-rich blood from recovered individuals (\u201cconvalescent plasma\u201d) can also potentially be used <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/plasma-from-coronavirus-survivors-found-to-help-severely-ill-patients\">to treat infected patients</a> with life-threatening disease.</p> \n<p>So the kits are useful for the study of populations and to identify potential antibody donors. But should you rush out and buy one? The <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/immunity-passports-in-the-context-of-covid-19\">World Health Organization </a>says that the tests can show if you\u2019ve had the virus but that there is \u201cno evidence that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection\u201d.</p> \n<p>The leading consultant oncologist <a href=\"https://www.therutherford.com/\">Prof</a><a href=\"https://www.therutherford.com/\"> Karol Sikora</a> argues that the kits are probably reliable but not necessarily useful for individuals. He says the dream ticket would be a test like a piece of litmus paper that you could put in the mouth to reveal both the presence of the active virus and antibodies to get an instant result. Biotech companies are working on it but it\u2019s a huge challenge. As things stand in the UK, there\u2019s no freely available, officially sanctioned antibody test to show previous infection and no wholly satisfactory antigen test to show active infection. (The antigen test relies on a swab being shoved up your throat and nose and transported to a distant lab for analysis. False negative rates are as high as 25% and portable tests are still unreliable.)</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/929083\">Sikora</a> says there are three groups of people on the streets, \u201cthe susceptible, the infected and the recovered or so-called <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31034-5/fulltext\">immunoprivileged</a>\u201d. We can\u2019t be sure but, based on experience with similar Sars and Mers viruses, he thinks that the recovered group who have antibodies are probably immune. How <a href=\"https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19-rapid-risk-assessment-coronavirus-disease-2019-eighth-update-8-april-2020.pdf\">strong or long-lasting that immunity</a> is, though, is anyone\u2019s guess.</p> \n<p>The rate of seroconversion (the percentage of people who have antibodies) in studies is lower than you\u2019d expect given the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/antibody-study-suggests-coronavirus-is-far-more-widespread-than-previously-thought\">prevalence of the disease</a> (between 1.5% and 20% in published studies and around 10% in Sikora\u2019s small study). This could be because the body can mount a swift and effective defence against a virus without forming lasting antibodies. So if you test positive for the virus (antigen test) but negative for antibodies, that means that you\u2019ve had the infection. But are you immune? The answer is a weak \u201cmaybe\u201d.</p> \n<p>Even if you are immune, what about the ethics of granting immunity passports\u2013 a kind of get out of jail free card \u2013 to those who test positive? The ethicist <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2765836\">Prof</a><a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2765836\"> Ezekiel Emanuel</a> argues that immunity-based licences would be good because they would free up individuals who have been infected already without worsening the situation of those who haven\u2019t. Licences would be based on hard facts so would not be discriminatory. That may be so, but doesn\u2019t allow for the fake or stolen documents that would be inevitable in our ethically impure world.</p> \n<p>Where does all this uncertainty leave us? Should my friend shell out \u00a3100? Will my life change when I get my result? Sikora says \u201cyou can wear your positive (antibody) test as a badge if you want to but you still have to stick to the law\u201d. Perhaps it would give you peace of mind if you can\u2019t resist a cuddle with a grandchild, he concedes, and frontline key workers in hospitals and care homes could feel and be safer. Ongoing population-based antigen and antibody testing are clearly vital tools in planning an exit strategy from lockdown. But personally, I wish I\u2019d saved my money \u2013and fingertips.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Ann Robinson is a GP</p>",

  "<p>Juan Pablo Villalobos, whose debut <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/13/down-rabbit-hole-villalobos-review\">Down the Rabbit Hole</a> </em>was shortlisted for the 2011 Guardian first book award, hails from Guadalajara in Mexico; in 2003 he moved to Barcelona to do a doctorate in literary theory with the help of an EU grant. The protagonist of his fourth novel is named Juan Pablo Villalobos; he hails from Guadalajara in Mexico, and moves to Barcelona to do a doctorate in literary theory with the help of an EU grant. This starting premise suggests a campus \u201cautofiction\u201d in the vein of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/08/the-topeka-school-by-ben-lerner-review\">Ben Lerner</a>, but things take a rather different turn when Juan Pablo\u2019s wheeler-dealer cousin embroils him in a criminal conspiracy involving some very bad dudes. They compel him to infiltrate a milieu of literary postgrads, with instructions to \u201clearn all the gender studies chitchat\u201d and seduce a student called Laia, the daughter of a wealthy Catalan magnate from whom they hope to extort money.</p> <p>It just so happens that Juan Pablo\u2019s thesis is on humour in Latin American literature, and his surreal sojourn in the criminal underworld affords him a perfect opportunity for fieldwork: the gangsters\u2019 dialogue, expletive-ridden and almost cartoonishly aggressive, abounds with casually misogynistic and xenophobic banter. The patter is lively and the language intentionally idiosyncratic: in his fascinating afterword, translator Daniel Hahn explains how he adapted the novel\u2019s variety of Hispanic vernaculars \u2013 encompassing Argentinian, Catalan and Mexican Spanish \u2013 into a series of distinct English registers.</p> <p><em>I Don\u2019t Expect Anyone to Believe Me </em>is an eccentric hybrid, combining pulpy crime fiction \u2013 there are basement murders, double-crossings, blacked-out cars \u2013 with avant-garde archness. Around 200 pages in, a tough warns Juan Pablo: \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten this far by sheer fucking fluke, buddy, but you must be on like page two hundred by now and this book has two-fifty at the absolute most.\u201d Literary life comes in for plenty of stick: Laia\u2019s father bonds with one of the gangsters over their shared contempt for \u201cliterature people [who] believe in feelings\u201d. Perhaps the real divide isn\u2019t between law abiders and criminals, but between men of action and the feckless dreamers who populate Juan Pablo\u2019s favourite novels. The self-doubt of bookish souls is well trodden ground, but Villalobos\u2019s take on it is refreshingly exuberant.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>I Don\u2019t Expect Anyone to Believe Me by Juan Pablo Villalobos, translated by Daniel Hahn, is published by And Other Stories (RRP \u00a311.99).</em></p>",
  "<p>Animal Crossing has been a thing for almost 20 years, but this year it has exploded. You cannot scroll through any social media feed without seeing one of its benign, big-headed characters in a screenshot or video showing off someone\u2019s beautifully tended desert island. Celebrities including Elijah Wood have been delighting fans by turning up to visit their towns. People who\u2019ve rarely played games before have been picking it up as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/lockdown-culture\">a lockdown distraction</a> \u2013 including Lauren Laverne, who enthused about it on her Radio 6 Music show. US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez picked it up a few days ago and has been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/05/07/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-is-now-playing-animal-crossing-shes-visiting-her-followers/\">visiting her Twitter followers</a>.</p> <p>Since the latest game, New Horizons, came out on 20 March, it has become a cliche to say that this is the game we all need right now. But if the numbers are anything to go by \u2013 it\u2019s been setting new records, selling 11m copies by the end of March \u2013 then it\u2019s absolutely true.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/directedbyrian/status/1253365992849276934\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">guys I tweeted my turnip prices and elijah wood just came to my island and hung out \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d this is the best day in quarantine yet <a href=\"https://t.co/H3mYJWnvgR\">pic.twitter.com/H3mYJWnvgR</a></p>&mdash; jessa \ud83e\udd8b (@directedbyrian) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/directedbyrian/status/1253365992849276934?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 23, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>For those untouched by the cult of Nook, Animal Crossing: New Horizons lets you set up an alternate life on a pleasant island populated by gently weird animals. You fish, catch bugs, water flowers, plant fruit trees and accumulate cute things with which to decorate your home and set dress the island. Players have put together everything from haunted houses to zen gardens to little farmers\u2019 markets and libraries. It is a relaxing game with a chill vibe \u2013 in theory.</p> <p>In reality, plenty of players are breaking it apart at the seams, turning their islands into aerial portraits of Sailor Moon, getting deep into hybrid flower agriculture theory, or plugging into shady networks of turnip-traders to amass 1%-er level riches on the game\u2019s \u201cstalk market\u201d. (Yes, that is a thing.) But this is part of Animal Crossing\u2019s magic: you really can play it the way you like. It can occupy you for a few hours a week, pootling around pulling up weeds and catching up with your penguin neighbour; or for hours every day, amassing wealth and furniture and clothing until your virtual house looks like an imaginative 12-year-old\u2019s dream mansion.</p> <p>In Kyoto, Japan, the game\u2019s creators at Nintendo are finding the immense virality of Animal Crossing: New Horizons validating, because this is a game designed to be shared.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"49fcfbf5863ad36426d4801bfe9eb193cc212714\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49fcfbf5863ad36426d4801bfe9eb193cc212714/0_0_670_906/370.jpg\" alt=\"Hisashi Nogami, Animal Crossing series producer at Nintendo, where he has worked since 1994.\" width=\"370\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hisashi Nogami, Animal Crossing series producer at Nintendo, where he has worked since 1994.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAnimal Crossing is a communication game,\u201d says Aya Kyogoku, who has worked on every Animal Crossing game since 2003. \u201cI hope that through their life in the game world, people enjoy communicating with each other, whether it\u2019s through playing with other people or talking enthusiastically about the game. What would make me most happy is if people with all kinds of different tastes come together and enjoy the game in their own ways.\u201d</p> <p>Hisashi Nogami, Animal Crossing series producer, who has been at Nintendo since 1994, says: \u201cIf, when you\u2019re playing, you\u2019re thinking about some day showing somebody what you\u2019ve achieved, or telling them about it, then maybe you\u2019ll feel differently. We are continually asking ourselves about what kind of place the game could have in people\u2019s actual lives.\u201d</p> <p>This is an important thing to understand: the game is played in social groups. I have four Animal Crossing group chats, with participants ranging from mums and dads playing with their kids to game-developer acquaintances to furloughed friends, all of them continually trading DIY tips, sought-after furniture and screenshots. We visit each others\u2019 islands to share fruits and admire island decor, or hang out on the beach to wish on shooting stars and chat.</p> <p>Animal Crossing is absorbing because it conjures the effect of a living world, one that continues whether or not you are there. Time passes as it does in real life, with changing weather and seasons; animal neighbours chat to you and write letters as if they\u2019ve got minds of their own; and everything on the island feels interconnected.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/apr/23/family-friendly-animal-crossing-takes-video-game-top-spot-amid-lockdown\">Family-friendly Animal Crossing takes video game top spot amid lockdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This illusion is hard to achieve, says Nogami, and introducing new Bells and whistles can throw off the balance. \u201cWe put a lot of thought and feeling into even the smallest features,\u201d he says. \u201cRather than looking at whether individual ideas are good or bad, we first think about the overall experience we want players to have, deciding on the concept that will form the pillar of the game. Everything we build must align with that concept. For this game, the concept was the deserted island.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very hard,\u201d says Kyogoku, \u201cto make decisions about individual parts before all of the features are connected, and that\u2019s a process we wrestled with again on this game. Even when we are coming up with ideas, we aren\u2019t thinking about that feature by itself. We think about where this feature would be positioned within Animal Crossing as a whole.\u201d</p> <p>Kyogoku uses New Horizon\u2019s DIY crafting as an example \u2013 \u201cit isn\u2019t simply about making items; you also need resources, and you can harvest these resources from trees and other things on the island. So, by having this feature, the plants that existed before in the series now gain a new purpose, and the feature was included partly because of this new value it brings.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8cab12e5acbdd323bdf4a8adeecedd66db403b2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cab12e5acbdd323bdf4a8adeecedd66db403b2e/0_0_682_900/379.jpg\" alt=\"Nintendo\u2019s Aya Kyogoku, who has worked on ever Animal Crossing game since joining the company in 2003.\" width=\"379\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nintendo\u2019s Aya Kyogoku, who has worked on ever Animal Crossing game since joining the company in 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Animal Crossing has always been popular, especially in Japan; launched in 2012, New Horizons\u2019 predecessor, New Leaf, sold more than 12m. But there\u2019s no doubt that it\u2019s attracting a huge number of new players. Part of that is surely down to the coronavirus pandemic. Stuck at home, millions of people are turning to video games for fun and safe social interaction, and a game that offers the comfort of a carefree existence in nature has proved especially appealing. Suddenly, Animal Crossing veterans find themselves with valuable knowledge and are delighted to share it.</p> <p>\u201cAnimal Crossing is a game that experienced players and newcomers alike can enjoy,\u201d says Nogami. \u201cIt\u2019s also fine to join in later, after launch. People who have been playing longer will have more knowledge and tips about living in the Animal Crossing world, and by sharing this information with others they may be able to enjoy their life on the island even more.\u201d</p> <p>A number of subtle changes to New Horizons make it more welcoming than older Animal Crossing games. It gives new players more direction in the early days and weeks, guiding them towards self-directed fun and self-expression. It is also a game whose time has finally come. Social media, connectivity, even the way we now use smartphones have helped it to burst through into popular culture.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Animal Crossing emerged 19 years ago,\u201d says Nogami, \u201cit was difficult to explain what it was within the framework of games up to that point. Although I believed it was fun, I was unsure whether many users would understand it. [But] I felt that the parts that were difficult to understand brought a uniqueness to the game and may be why the games have been loved by fans for so long.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve added all kinds of features appropriate for the modern era, and made improvements to make the games more convenient, but the core hasn\u2019t changed. One of our goals with these games is to connect people. People who played the N64 version as a child probably now have families of their own. I hope people will play with family and friends, having fun across generations.\u201d</p>",

  "<p><br>This is not your usual \u201cwhy the classics are crucial\u201d book. Helen Morales has produced a passionate, deeply felt account of the ways in which myths have reinforced the most harmful narratives of social control \u2013 or been unlocked to help lift them. It is a book infused with a lifetime\u2019s scholarship but remains clear, approachable and very personal. It brings classics into the realm of climate activism, race politics, gender identity, body image, and #MeToo (or #metu as Morales has it, in a punning chapter heading).</p> <p>Slim, punchy and galvanising, <em>Antigone Rising</em> brings the kind of challenge and insight that made <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/22/women-and-power-a-manifesto-by-mary-beard-review\">Women and Power</a></em>, by the author\u2019s former colleague Mary Beard, such a popular success, but in its flavour and politics there is much more of the California radical \u2013 Morales is professor of Hellenic studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara \u2013 than the Cambridge realist.</p> <p>The subtitle is \u201cThe Subversive Power of the Ancient Myths\u201d. Morales does not write only about stories from mythology as such, but also about the myths the modern world has created from classical texts. One passage, for example, deals with the sex strike as a tool of resistance. This idea is often identified as deriving from Aristophanes\u2019 comedy <em>Lysistrata</em>, in which the women of war-plagued Greece decide to withhold sex from their men until peace is established.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Lysistrata, performed by a male cast to a (probably) largely male audience, is a comedic fantasy, not a feminist call to arms</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the play, performed by a male cast to a (probably) largely male audience is a comedic fantasy, not a feminist call to arms. Activist<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/08/feminist-battle-women-activists-campaigns\"> Leymah Gbowee</a> was labelled the \u201cLiberian Lysistrata\u201d after the western press picked up on the fact that the women\u2019s movement in Liberia had staged such a strike in its efforts to end the civil war in 2002. In fact, as the Nobel laureate pointed out in her memoir, quoted here by Morales: \u201cThe truth is that the greatest weapons of the Liberian women\u2019s movement were moral clarity, persistence and patience.\u201d The sex strike, though attention grabbing, formed a tiny part of the struggle. Framing the Liberian women\u2019s protest in terms of Aristophanes is, Morales argues, unhelpful \u2013 \u201ca distorting mirror that reduces women to bodies and complex political action to titillation\u201d. When she met Gbowee, Morales asked her what she thought about the play and the comparisons made in the press. \u201cShe said nothing but gave me a long look of unmitigated contempt.\u201d</p> <p>So much for lazy parallel-making, for placing complex actions into a constricting classical frame. Nevertheless, as Morales writes, creative readings, even misreadings, of classical texts and stories can be immensely generative. In the 19th century, gay men often saw themselves reflected in Greek literature. It mattered little that the social context in which desire operated in classical Athens was a world away from theirs. What mattered was that there were different ways of thinking about love other than those they had been told were right and natural, and that the source of these different ways of thinking was the classical world, with its immense cultural capital.</p> <p>Similarly, myths that deal with a change of sex are proving intriguing today, notwithstanding the fact that stories like that of the prophet Tiresias (who turned into a woman for several years) and Caenis/Caeneus (who asked to become a man after she was raped by the god Neptune), often need to be read against the text if they are to be seen as affirming of trans experience. Morales shows how Ali Smith\u2019s novel <em>Girl Meets Boy</em>, her gorgeous rewriting of the myth of Iphis and Ianthe (in which the former is transformed into a man), opens up and plays with Ovid\u2019s <em>Metamorphoses</em> in a way that\u2019s both fond and irreverent, playful and critical.</p> <p>Creative misreadings and deliberate subversions are in fact central to the classical tradition in the sense that the Greeks and Romans themselves did it all the time. The essence of classical mythology is its mutability; the myths have no canonical versions. They have always existed in order to be activated \u2013 by being reread and repurposed by writers and readers. There were multiple versions of the Medea story, for example. In many of them, the Colchian princess did not kill her children \u2013 though that killing is, to readers in the modern world, an indelible part of her narrative owing to the brilliance and popularity of Euripides\u2019 play <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/mar/07/medea-review-barbican-london-simon-stone\">Medea</a></em>.</p> <p>Euripides also wrote <em>Helen</em>, in which the face that launched a thousand ships was actually a phantom made of clouds created by the gods. In this version, the real Helen sits out the war in Egypt. That this tale is radically different from what most people have always understood as the story of the Trojan war does not make it any less of a Greek myth.<br><br>Many Greek myths are, frankly, depressingly misogynist. You will be hard pushed to find a positive paradigm for a stepmother, for example. Take your choice: what about Ino, who advised her husband to sacrifice to Zeus the children from her husband\u2019s first marriage? (The children, Phrixus and Helle, flew away on a golden ram, though Helle fell into the sea, giving her name to the Hellespont.) Or would you prefer Phaedra, who lusted after her stepson Hippolytus, then, after being rejected, falsely accused him of rape? This, of course, is an especially damaging myth, helping reinforce the pernicious assumption that women cannot be trusted when it comes to rape claims. There\u2019s little idea of sisterhood, of female solidarity, in Greek mythology: literal pairs of sisters \u2013 Electra and Chrysothemis, Antigone and Ismene \u2013 are often framed in opposition to each other, the strong, powerful one versus the weak, submissive one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f335d1ce174443c405d0c2e3e47764e87da0b9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f335d1ce174443c405d0c2e3e47764e87da0b9f/8_173_2005_1203/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tara Fitzgerald in Sophocles\u2019s Antigone.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tara Fitzgerald in Sophocles\u2019s <em>Antigone.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Antigone \u2013 the mythical princess of Thebes who defied the law against giving her brother a proper burial \u2013 is a character who has often been creatively misread to provide a model for female activism. Morales, though, also shows the importance of heading back to the text and attending to its nuances. Sophocles\u2019s play shows us that Antigone\u2019s rejection of her sister\u2019s offer of solidarity \u2013 always preferring \u201cI\u201d to \u201cwe\u201d \u2013 makes her her a tricky exemplar for today\u2019s inclusive activists. Which is not to undermine the character\u2019s resonance: as Morales points out, Antigone\u2019s spirit \u2013 in the most positive possible way \u2013 lives on in Greta Thunberg and Malala Yousafzai.</p> <p>The long history of classics has seen it co-opted into many causes on the left and right, but it has most damagingly been used as part of a structure of thinking that underpinned European imperialism. Even the gleaming white marble of ancient statuary \u2013 which we now know to have been originally brightly painted \u2013 has been called on to reinforce white ideals of beauty; these snowy marble statues are still being pressed into service to promote white supremacy.</p> <p>For some, this history dooms classics altogether. Morales, however, shows how it is possible to break classics out of this harmful frame \u2013 indeed how this is happening, all around us. A particularly uplifting section relates to the uses of the Louvre by the Carters (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce\">Beyonc\u00e9</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/jayz\">Jay-Z</a>) as the magnificent stage for their video for the single \u201cApeshit\u201d. Beyonc\u00e9 danced, gloriously, in front of the Nike of Samothrace, the great Hellenistic winged sculpture that stands at the head of the Louvre\u2019s most imposing staircase. Nike is Greek for victory, and Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z\u2019s takeover of this temple to western art was indeed triumphant. As Morales writes, at one point the video shows young black men taking the knee, alluding to the National Football League protests against police killings of unarmed black men in the US. Immediately beforehand comes a shot of a Roman copy of a famous Greek sculpture of the god Hermes, in a similar bent-knee pose.</p> <p>Co-opting Hermes into a fight against racism? Why not? As Morales shows, for all that myths have often been used as a means of repression, they are only waiting to be repurposed as forces for liberation.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Antigone Rising: The Subversive Power of the Ancient Myths</em> <em>is published by Wildfire (RRP \u00a318.99).

My cancellation wasn\u2019t related to Covid-19. It has now removed the 17 March statement from its website.

A Facebook page of over 500 customers is campaigning for refunds and the largely laudatory rating it had on <a href=\"https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.holidayextras.co.uk\">Trustpilot</a> pre-Covid has degenerated into howls of outrage from scores of people who had paid for cancellation cover and are being fobbed off with a voucher, despite initial promises of their money back.</p> <p>Appeals directly to the service providers have failed as hotels and car parks claim not to have received the money from the company. In an email to customers, Holiday Extras claims that \u201cthe circumstances are so exceptional that we have had to opt for an exceptional solution which means we are only able to issue a voucher\u201d.</p> <p>It insists that a <em>force majeure</em> clause, which specifies pandemics, was added to its terms and conditions last autumn and exempts it from liability. However, customers can\u2019t check which terms applied when they booked, as booking confirmation links to the evolving online page.</p> <p>On my second approach to the company, it implied it might relax its stance. \u201cAt this point, customers up to 16 March are receiving cash refunds and we will look to extend this date in the coming days and weeks as we work through a significant volume of contacts and requests from customers,\u201d it says. \u201cIn recognition of the uncertainty around future travel bookings, the validity of vouchers has been stretched to three years after the date of issue.\u201d</p> <p>It declined to confirm whether hotels and providers have already been paid. Legally, a company can\u2019t retrospectively change its terms and conditions, however exceptional the circumstances, although some are doing so, but it would require action through the Small Claims Court to enforce this unless the regulator intervenes.</p> <p>The Competition and Markets Authority has confirmed that refunds are due if lockdown forces the cancellation of a contract. Some customers report successful claims from their credit card issuer via Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act, but this only applies to bookings worth \u00a3100 or more.</p> <p>Other customers are being left out of pocket because of anomalies in terms and conditions. <strong>RB</strong> of Tiverton, Devon bought home insurance from<a href=\"https://www.nfumutual.co.uk/ppc/md-home/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI7IjgiaSf6QIVW-ztCh3azAAYEAAYASAAEgJNRPD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\"> NFU Mutual</a>, which included cover for loss of income should he be unable to let his holiday cottage. \u201cThe policy provided cover of up to \u00a3500,000 for loss of profits following \u2018restricted access outside your control\u2019,\u201d he writes. \u201cWhen we tried to claim for bookings cancelled due to the pandemic we were told we were not covered, even though the schedule of cover specifically includes infectious disease.\u201d</p> <p>It so happens that the day I contacted NFU it performed a U-turn, stating a newly discovered \u201cdiscrepancy\u201d between the wording of its policy document and the Insurance Product Information Document (IPID) and Schedule.

Samsung has been making smartwatches since 2013 and it shows \u2013 the Galaxy Watch Active 2 is the most polished this side of the Apple Watch Series 5.</p> <h2>Slim and sleek design</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5928930cab4fc6234d1cb15e8da5995cdea18500\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5928930cab4fc6234d1cb15e8da5995cdea18500/1022_662_3015_1809/1000.jpg\" alt=\"samsung galaxy watch active 2 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Active 2 will easily slip under shirt cuffs and is fairly small and discreet for a smartwatch despite the large screen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Active 2 comes in 40mm and 44mm sizes, both measuring 10.9mm thick. The 44mm version weighs just 30g without the strap, which is 6.5g lighter than the aluminium 44mm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/23/apple-watch-series-5-review-the-king-of-smartwatches\">Apple Watch Series 5</a> and just one-third the weight of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/24/fossil-gen-5-review-googles-wear-os-smartwatch-at-its-best\">Fossil Gen 5</a>.</p> <p>It has a large, crisp and bright OLED screen that\u2019s easily readable outdoors, plus an excellent selection of digital and analogue watch faces, and a large store of third-party offerings too.</p> <p>The thin bezel around the edge of the screen has a neat trick: it is touch sensitive and acts like a rotary controller similar to the spinning bezels on previous Samsung smartwatches.</p> <p>Slide your finger around the edge to scroll through lists, between screens or adjust numbers, with little vibration clicks for each increment. It\u2019s a simple and effective control scheme that is well integrated into the whole of the system unlike digital crowns in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/24/fossil-gen-5-review-googles-wear-os-smartwatch-at-its-best\">Wear OS</a>. Taps, swipes, a physical back button and an apps button take care of the rest.</p> <p>The Active 2 is water-resistant to a depth of 50 metres, and has a special water mode for preventing accidental activation and clearing the speaker of liquid when you come out. The watch comes with a high quality silicone strap, and takes standard 20mm watch bands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e744ed169fb9e6a111bb26fd8f2387e98e7a8b22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e744ed169fb9e6a111bb26fd8f2387e98e7a8b22/0_108_4817_2892/1000.jpg\" alt=\"samsung galaxy watch active 2 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Active 2 takes regular 20mm straps, which are easy to swap in and out and are available for as little as \u00a35.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Specifications</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Screen:</strong> 1.2in or 1.4in AMOLED (364 ppi)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Case size:</strong> 40 or 44mm</p></li> <li><p><strong>Case thickness:</strong> 10.9mm</p></li> <li><p><strong>Band size:</strong> standard 20mm</p></li> <li><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 26g or 30g</p></li> <li><p><strong>Processor:</strong> Samsung Exynos 9110 dual-core 1.15GHz</p></li> <li><p><strong>RAM:</strong> 0.75GB</p></li> <li><p><strong>Storage:</strong> 4GB</p></li> <li><p><strong>Operating system:</strong> Tizen 4.0 (One UI 1.5)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Water resistance:</strong> 50 metres (5ATM)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Sensors:</strong> barometer, gyro, HR sensor, light sensor, microphone, speaker, NFC, GPS</p></li> <li><p><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth 5, wifi</p></li> </ul> <h2>Slick performance and battery life</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1bbc1bfb9ff27b9df8c8792b292763cd3c67c5ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bbc1bfb9ff27b9df8c8792b292763cd3c67c5ef/649_639_3351_2011/1000.jpg\" alt=\"samsung galaxy watch active 2 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A small wireless puck clips on to the back of the watch via magnets for easy charging.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Samsung makes both the hardware and the software for its smartwatches and it really pays off. Performance all round is fast, snappy and lag-free. It\u2019s considerably better than even the best Wear OS watches, and very close to the slick experience Apple offers.</p> <p>With the screen on all the time, I easily get more than two days battery out of the Active 2, even with a 25-minute run or a two-hour walk tracked in high-accuracy mode.</p> <p>The Active 2 wirelessly charges in just under two hours using a puck that magnetically attaches to the back of the watch. You can also charge the watch from the back of a Samsung smartphone with Powershare and with compatible wireless chargers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d641b009623fabd61a52cad117315943cb951ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d641b009623fabd61a52cad117315943cb951ad/411_299_3910_2347/1000.jpg\" alt=\"samsung galaxy watch active 2 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Galaxy Wearable app on your phone handles the connection to your watch, settings, app installs and updates, watch faces and other bits and pieces.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The watch connects to your phone via Bluetooth, but can also remotely connect through wifi when out of range. The connection was strong and reliable, managed by the Samsung Galaxy Wearable app, which handles pairing, settings, apps and other bits.</p> <p>You can connect Bluetooth headphones directly to the watch to play music and listen to alerts without a phone too. Calls can also be taken directly on the watch, which works surprisingly well.</p> <h2>Sustainability</h2> <p>The Active 2 is generally repairable by authorised service centres, with diagnostics costing \u00a315 outside of the one-year warranty and screen repairs costing in excess of \u00a3100. Samsung offers <a href=\"http://go.theguardian.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fuk%2Ftrade-in%2F&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/19/samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-review-the-superphone-thats-a-little-too-massive\">trade-in</a> and <a href=\"https://www.samsungrecycle.co.uk/\">recycling schemes</a> for old devices.</p> <h2>Tizen</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3df603286f38b22c5b06b63c67270d1d3cf3f9ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3df603286f38b22c5b06b63c67270d1d3cf3f9ec/415_526_4128_2478/1000.jpg\" alt=\"samsung galaxy watch active 2 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The rotary interface works really well, making the most of the round screen and making app selection and scrolling through lists and text easy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Samsung\u2019s smartwatches run the firm\u2019s own Tizen operating system, rather than Google\u2019s Wear OS or Android. Since release in 2019, the Active 2 has received a series of updates that have improved various aspects of the watch. The firm has also offered long-term software updates to previous watches, which bodes well for new models coming this year.</p> <p>Tizen is based on a rotary interface, which makes the most of round watch screens, but can also be swiped with your finger.</p> <p>Notifications appear in tiles to the left of the watch face while widgets including music controls are on the right. Swipe down from the top for quick settings. Press the apps button on the side of the watch to bring up a ring of app icons, which you can tap or scroll around using the bezel.</p> <p>Tap a notification to expand and scroll through text, or swipe up to dismiss. You can action the notification with the same options you\u2019d have on your phone or quick reply to messages using canned responses, a T9-like keyboard, drawing letters on screen or dictation. It all works really well.</p> <p>There are only a handful of third-party apps, but that does include Strava and some other fitness tracking apps, plus Spotify which includes offline music downloads and playback.</p> <h2>Samsung Pay and Bixby</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e39128355a9325439cf70609c6226fbfe317374\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e39128355a9325439cf70609c6226fbfe317374/447_543_3950_2371/1000.jpg\" alt=\"samsung galaxy watch active 2 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">When Bixby works, it\u2019s perfectly capable of doing simple things such as setting timers and alarms, but forget trying to ask things such as the top speed of an African swallow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Active 2 has contactless payments, but it\u2019s limited to Samsung Pay, which has <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/samsung-pay/\">very little support in the UK</a> compared with Google Pay or Apple Pay. None of my credit or debit cards are supported.</p> <p>Samsung\u2019s voice assistant, Bixby, is the least polished bit of the Active 2. You can set timers, alarms, turn features on or off, start workouts, ask for the weather and other bits, but you cannot ask general knowledge questions. It also fails to activate sometimes, fails to understand more often than competitors and a recent update to Bixby broke it entirely requiring a full reset of the watch to fix.</p> <h2>Samsung Health</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c77f16758d29cd93ed1727a24b985d5ceb2e6dec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c77f16758d29cd93ed1727a24b985d5ceb2e6dec/335_487_4350_2611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"samsung galaxy watch active 2 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samsung Health ticks almost every box when it comes to health and fitness tracking, including stress monitoring with guiding breathing exercises.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Samsung Health is most comprehensive health-tracking services available and is built into the Active 2.</p> <p>It has all the usual features: constant heart rate, stress, steps, floors climbed, activity and menstrual cycle. But it also has hydration, caffeine, weight and sleep.</p> <p>Sleep tracking is good, matching data from a mattress-based tracker. Workout tracking is equally comprehensive, including walking, running, hiking, cycling, swimming, circuits, weights, yoga, loads of calisthenics and various gym machines.</p> <p>For running, you get many of the same options you get from a lower-end dedicated running watch. You can customise the information on screen, set targets for distance, time, calories, set up guides or laps and have the watch automatically pause when you do. The back button pauses or starts the run, which is better than using a touchscreen.</p> <p>The GPS-trace, pace and heart rate readings in high-accuracy mode in suburban London were similar to a Garmin Forerunner 245 too.</p> <p>The watch has the hardware to perform an ECG, but it\u2019s currently disabled pending an update with no timescale. The firm recently <a href=\"http://www.samsungmobilepress.com/pressreleases/samsung-announces-blood-pressure-monitoring-application-for-galaxy-watch-devices\">won regulatory approval in South Korea</a> for a blood pressure monitoring system, which is expected to roll out there later this year.</p> <h2>Observations</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfeaa2af4d8431f36da4e67b6d8df4d08b9b7bae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfeaa2af4d8431f36da4e67b6d8df4d08b9b7bae/869_696_3242_1946/1000.jpg\" alt=\"samsung galaxy watch active 2 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The back of the watch has the various sensors including heart rate scanner in a lump that sits comfortably on your wrist without being sweaty.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>The watch would not charge from the back of a OnePlus 8 Pro or a Belkin Qi wireless charging pad.</p></li> <li><p>The short, sharp vibrations for notifications and haptics are some of the best outside of the Apple Watch.</p></li> <li><p>There were playback and/or volume control issues with some headphones including Apple\u2019s Beats and AirPods, and AfterShokz\u2019s Aeropex.</p></li> <li><p>The Active 2 can be used with an iPhone but has limited functions compared to Android.</p></li> <li><p>I found it difficult to get size right with the silicone strap.</p></li> <li><p>Nest and Ring smart camera alerts fail to show an image on the watch with the notification, but Arlo\u2019s similar cameras show images just fine.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Price</h2> <p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 comes in either 40mm or 44mm sizes and with or without 4G connectivity.</p> <p>The Bluetooth aluminium version costs <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/wearables/galaxy-watch-active2-r830/SM-R830NZDABTU/buy/\">\u00a3269</a> for 40mm and <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/wearables/galaxy-watch-active2/SM-R820NZDABTU/buy/\">\u00a3289</a> for 44mm.

Other branded versions are available.</p> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p>The Galaxy Watch Active 2 might not actually run Android, but that\u2019s to its benefit. As Google\u2019s Wear OS has stagnated, Samsung has steadily improved Tizen and provided updates for its existing watches for years.</p> <p>The Active 2 is light, well-made, small with a large, bright, always-on screen. There are plenty of watch faces to choose from, the battery lasts two days and apps such as Strava and offline Spotify are actually good.</p> <p>The Active 2 also excels at tracking health and fitness, beyond simply steps or runs, leaning on the long-standing Samsung Health platform.</p> <p>But a few niggles such as poor support for Samsung Pay in the UK, Bixby and some notification oddities hold it back from being a five-star product. It can be used with an iPhone, but the Apple Watch is miles better on iOS.</p> <p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 is the best all-round smartwatch you can get for Android.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> slim, big and bright screen, lightweight, slick performance, long battery life, excellent fitness and health tracking, 50 metre water resistance, standard 20mm straps, long software support, cross platform.</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> poor contactless payment support, Bixby is poor, issues with some smart camera notifications from some manufacturers, limited functionality with an iPhone.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19bd66c0ea9fba67690ea26781aabc6c86d29d0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19bd66c0ea9fba67690ea26781aabc6c86d29d0d/427_487_4034_2422/1000.jpg\" alt=\"samsung galaxy watch active 2 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the best bits of Samsung\u2019s Tizen watches are the large variety of excellent faces built in, with many thousands more available in the Galaxy Store.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Other reviews</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/24/fossil-gen-5-review-googles-wear-os-smartwatch-at-its-best\">Fossil Gen 5 review: Google\u2019s Wear OS smartwatch at its best</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/23/apple-watch-series-5-review-the-king-of-smartwatches\">Apple Watch Series 5 review: the king of smartwatches</a></strong></p></li> </ul>",
  "<h2>Top story: Virus not going to disappear, Fauci warns</h2> \n<p>Hello and good morning from me, Warren Murray. Hopefully you are settled into a comfortable position \u2013 or a comfortable stride. Here is the news to start your Wednesday.</p> \n<p>Eight million people with underlying health conditions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/millions-with-health-conditions-at-risk-from-covid-19-if-forced-back-to-work\">should be exempted</a> from plans to get Britain back to work and normal life, according to scientists who warn that easing lockdown too quickly could propel the Covid-19 death toll to 73,000 this year. Union leaders have voiced concerns over Boris Johnson\u2019s exhortations to people to return to work from today if their jobs can\u2019t be done from home. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/stay-alert-or-stay-home-how-covid-19-lockdown-rules-differ-across-uk\">Whether to \u201cstay alert\u201d or \u201cstay home\u201d</a> is a different story from today depending on where you live in the UK, with devolved administrations diverging from the central government\u2019s plans for lifting the lockdown.</p> \n<p>As many as 6,000 children around the world could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/13/unicef-6000-children-could-die-every-day-due-to-impact-of-coronavirus\">die every day from preventable causes</a> over the next six months due to the impact of coronavirus on routine health services, such as family planning, childbirth, postnatal care and vaccination, Unicef has warned. This is in addition to the 2.5 million children who die globally every six months before their fifth birthday, and threatens to reverse nearly a decade of progress on ending preventable child deaths.</p> \n<p>Brazil and Mexico have both seen deaths from Covid-19 spike sharply on their deadliest days yet. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/global-report-brazil-and-mexico-record-deadliest-day-from-covid-19\">US remains by far the worst-affected country</a> and now has almost one-third of the world\u2019s 4.26m cases, and a national death tally of 82,339. Dr Anthony Fauci, the US government\u2019s top public health expert, has warned in Senate testimony via videoconference that the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll is under-counted and \u201cthe consequences could be really serious\u201d if America relaxes safeguards too abruptly.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cde94e03-8944-495c-8a0d-dc41e6593605\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TsRmIhTJ5YM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThere is a real risk that you will trigger an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/fauci-testimony-coronavirus-reopening-deaths-hearing\">outbreak that you might not be able to control</a>. Not only leading to some suffering and death, but it could even set you back on the road to economic recovery.\u201d Fauci said America might be headed in the right direction but this did not mean the pandemic was under control. And as Trump has claimed more than once, is the virus going to disappear? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/fauci-coronavirus-testimony-trump-reality-check\">\u201cThat is just not going to happen,\u201d</a> said Fauci, who has headed the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984.</p> \n<p>Jump on to our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/13/coronavirus-live-news-brazil-reports-record-881-deaths-as-wuhan-prepares-to-test-11m-residents\">live blog</a> for more Covid-19 news as it breaks, and here are the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance\">big developments at a glance</a>.</p> \n<p><em>There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice</a>.</em></p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Pension changes wreck health \u2013 </strong>Women in lower-grade occupations forced to work up to six years longer because of changes to the state pension age are a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/13/women-in-lower-grade-jobs-hit-by-pension-change-at-greater-risk-of-depression\">third more likely to suffer debilitating and potentially permanent depression</a>, as well as higher rates of health problems, according to a paper by academics at King\u2019s College London. \u201cWe know that worsening mental health will lead to higher healthcare costs, higher use of disability benefits and greater use of health services. Worsening mental health also leads to lower economic productivity and reduced ability to participate in life,\u201d said Dr Ludovico Carrino, co-author of the research paper. Almost 4 million women born in the 1950s lost their pensions when the pension age was raised from 60 to 66 between 2010 and 2018. The BackTo60 campaign took the government to court last year and lost but is appealing the verdict.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Midweek catch-up</strong></p> \n<p>&gt; At least five experienced surfers have drowned after going into the sea in stormy weather off the coast of The Hague. Their lives were lost in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/death-of-five-surfers-in-storm-shocks-netherlands\">thick foam whipped up by wind and waves</a> that hampered rescue efforts. Authorities fear more victims after the coast guard picked up more surfboards than victims.</p> \n<p>&gt; The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is due in Israel today to discuss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/mike-pompeo-to-break-travel-hiatus-for-hours-long-visit-to-israel\">US-backed plans to annex Palestinian land</a>. France, Ireland and Belgium are reportedly considering economic retaliation if Israel breaks international law by unilaterally claiming sovereignty over land it occupies.</p> \n<p>&gt; Georgia is investigating the prosecutors who first handled the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was killed while out jogging. Gregory and Travis McMichael were charged with murder last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/12/ahmaud-arbery-georgia-prosecutors-under-investigation\">more than two months after Arbery was shot</a>.</p> \n<p>&gt; Volunteers spending their lockdown poring over aerial surveys of the Cornwall and Devon borders have spotted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/13/amateur-archaeologists-redraw-map-of-roman-britain-from-home\">30 previously unknown Roman settlements</a> believed to date from between 300BC and AD300, as well as more than 20 miles of Roman road. And so far they have only studied a tenth of the material available.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Wind power ramp-up \u2013 </strong>Britain\u2019s biggest green energy companies are working on multibillion-pound wind farm investments across the north-east of England and Scotland to help power a cleaner economic recovery.

They looked at German shepherds, golden retrievers, labrador retrievers or crosses of the breeds, which start puberty at about six to nine months old.

  "<p>In a past life, the satirist Charlie Brooker may have been one of those dogs with a sixth sense for imminent natural disaster, barking urgently at the humans who are blithely unaware their whole world is about to be smashed to smithereens. The preteen Brooker watched scary TV documentaries about nuclear war and assumed it would happen some day. As the co-creator of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/06/every-episode-of-black-mirror-ranked-charlie-brooker\">Emmy-award-winning series Black Mirror</a>, he has offered dystopian prophecies of the unintended consequences of technology, from robotic killer dogs to tracking chip implants in Matrix-like virtual worlds. So a microbe shaking civilisation to its core can\u2019t have come as a complete surprise.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s odd,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know the film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/30/what-can-we-learn-about-coronavirus-from-watching-contagion\">Contagion that lots of people have watched recently</a>? When that came out and I read the description and everyone said this is really horrible and you should wash your hands a million times and use hand gel, I thought, there\u2019s no way on earth I\u2019m ever gonna watch that because that is exactly the sort of thing that terrifies me.</p> <p>\u201cLike when swine flu happened, I went around using hand gel and not touching doorknobs for several months. I\u2019ve always been a bit of a hypochondriac. I\u2019m like this every year when the norovirus happens and I\u2019ve always been concerned that something \u2013 you can detect, obviously, in Black Mirror a certain level of paranoia \u2013 that things could slide out of control at any moment.\u201d</p> <p>One of Black Mirror\u2019s best-known episodes, USS Callister, ends with a bully, Robert Daly, trapped inside a tiny spacecraft screaming: \u201cExit fucking game!\u201d as the lights of his computer-simulated universe wink out around him. At times, pandemic lockdown can make us all feel like Daly, floating in the void with no exit in sight. Brooker\u2019s blend of self-scrutiny, Alan Bennett-esque whimsy and curmudgeonly profanities would appear to make him an ideal pub companion. But the pubs are closed, so Brooker is speaking by phone from his home in Ealing, west London.</p> <p>It seems hard to be a Pollyanna-in-reverse, living in a perpetual state of hyperanxiety. But having long suspected that Armageddon is around the corner, has Brooker thicker psychological armour for the pandemic? \u201cI do think that, in a strange way, when the worst actually happens \u2013 I don\u2019t know if this is true for everyone who\u2019s an anxious or neurotic person, but it\u2019s definitely true for my head \u2013 you\u2019re not worrying about what is unknown because it\u2019s right in front of you. In fact, it\u2019s hypnotically clear what the challenge is. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m relaxed, but I don\u2019t have that sense of creeping dread of the unknown.</p> <p>\u201cThat means I\u2019m slightly acclimatised. I\u2019m not going through a giant psychological shock that this has happened because, in a way, I sort of thought it might. I don\u2019t think that in a smart-arsey way, but I had felt worried, for years, because having watched lots of nuclear war stuff as a kid, I assumed that was going to happen to me. I assumed I was going to be stumbling through rubble eating rats, so this happening just confirms my expectations in many ways.</p> <p>\u201cIt means once it\u2019s happened and it\u2019s occurring, I\u2019m not having to deal so much \u2013 obviously, like anyone I\u2019ve got my abyss-staring moments \u2013 but I\u2019m not having to deal so much with a huge adjustment, in a way. Hopefully that doesn\u2019t sound like bragging. It\u2019s certainly nothing to brag about.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1f577f97272964db5efcae214979a83e71613e35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f577f97272964db5efcae214979a83e71613e35/0_0_2986_4479/667.jpg\" alt=\"Black Mirror: USS Callister.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Black Mirror: USS Callister.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In isolation, he banged his head on a pull-up bar and almost had to go to accident and emergency. (\u201cIf you\u2019ve got a pull-up bar that goes in a doorway, immediately take it down and throw it away because it genuinely nearly killed me.\u201d) He and his wife, the former Blue Peter presenter Konnie Huq, are trying to juggle work commitments with home-schooling their sons, aged eight and six. \u201cTheir screen time has gone through the roof,\u201d Brooker says, cheerfully, a child\u2019s yell occasionally audible in the background. \u201cTheir screen time has probably always been higher and really would get me drummed off Mumsnet. But I always think, well, I watched loads of telly. And I think video games are good for you. If they\u2019re playing Mario Maker 2, where you\u2019re creating, I think that\u2019s much better than just watching a cartoon or something, so I don\u2019t particularly mind.\u201d</p> <p>Brooker has been catching up with Quiz, Tiger King and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/20/unorthodox-a-thrilling-story-of-rebellion-and-freedom-from-new-york-to-berlin\">Unorthodox</a>, as well as his \u201ccomfort watch\u201d, MasterChef. He grumbles: \u201cI just don\u2019t think things should have a one-word title. I mean, I guess you could get away with Quiz, but a show called See \u2013 why am I gonna watch that? Make an effort. If you can\u2019t be bothered to put two words in your title, why should I be bothered to tune in?\u201d</p> <p>He does get out for a walk or jog once a day. \u201cI\u2019m very aware if I\u2019m going out running that the joggers have got a bad rep at the moment, spluttering and running past. So I go out of my way to run into the middle of the road or cross the street and I get very cross when I see someone not doing that. I don\u2019t bother saying anything to them because what if they came over and hit me?\u201d</p> <p>For Brooker, who wrote the column <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/screenburn\">Screen Burn for the Guardian\u2019s Guide</a> from 2000 to 2010, there has also been an opportunity to revive one of his greatest hits, Wipe, in which he caustically reviews and skewers television from a sofa. The concept started life with Screenwipe on BBC Four in 2006 and moved to BBC Two with Newswipe, Gameswipe, Weekly Wipe and annual Wipes. Now a 45-minute <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/22/charlie-brooker-to-return-to-bbc-with-lockdown-special-antiviral-wipe\">Antiviral Wipe special will broadcast on Thursday</a>, including the familiar characters Philomena Cunk (Diane Morgan) and Barry Shitpeas (Al Campbell).</p> <p>Hollywood and the West End might be comatose, but Wipe marches on. Brooker was lucky to have a literal in-house production team that included Huq and a documentary-maker who has been helping with childcare and staying in a spare room. He also has the familiar sofa rescued from the studio when the show finished. \u201cThe only difference is that people have to keep running off to deal with a crying baby or the internet goes down or we have to synchronise our toilet breaks. Other than that, it\u2019s surprisingly seamless.\u201d</p> <p>The virus may seem like a tough topic for Wipe, but Brooker says: \u201cObviously we\u2019re mindful of the fact that this is an extreme time for everybody, but hopefully we\u2019re getting it right tonally. I hope we\u2019re not being patronising. It\u2019s not kid gloves. There\u2019s a bit of gallows humour in there. I think that\u2019s important and I think that\u2019s human and I think that\u2019s cathartic, and you just have to gauge it right. There are things to laugh at and there are things to question.\u201d</p> <p>Over in the US, Donald Trump has memorably suggested that once the lockdown ends, the coronavirus \u201cmust be quickly forgotten\u201d and the economy will boom. Does Brooker think that in, say, a couple of years from now, life can go back to normal, as if the virus never happened? Or has it changed everything for good?</p> <p>\u201cI would imagine probably somewhere in the middle,\u201d he replies. \u201cThere\u2019s an absolute thirst for: \u2018Oh, can we just go back to how things were\u2019, but the longer it goes on, the longer we\u2019ll forget what that was like. Weirdly, just the thought of things like everyone crowding into a stadium to watch a gig feels like: \u2018Oh my God, why would you do that?\u2019 at the moment. But I daresay behaviour changes. It happened after Spanish flu as well, so I imagine certain things we\u2019ll just forget about and go back to normal.</p> <p>\u201cHopefully, the other thing this does is throw into relief all sorts of things about what should be important in society in general and makes certain things fairly undeniable. God, how many people are now really delighted about the existence of delivery drivers, whereas a few months ago I would moan about delivery drivers with the best of them.\u201d He puts on a grouchy voice. \u201c\u2018He threw the parcel over the gate. Silly bastard. Typical.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI was a bit rude about a postman the other day and it\u2019s haunted me. I was like: \u2018I\u2019m not coming out to sign for that.\u2019 And then I thought maybe I was a bit terse with him and I didn\u2019t need to be. I\u2019m sure that you\u2019re not meant to sign for them at the moment; but trying to have that debate through a closed door?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05f72f9a2db261e7c2f38a31e07a8a3b00fcd730\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05f72f9a2db261e7c2f38a31e07a8a3b00fcd730/0_0_2050_1367/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charlie Brooker\u2019s Screenwipe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlie Brooker\u2019s Screenwipe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Endemol</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The wretched state of the economy, he notes, has been relegated to almost an afterthought. \u201cI\u2019m fortunate because I\u2019ve got a job at the moment so I\u2019m not having to worry about the stock market. But, again, you\u2019d hope that this means that it\u2019s hard to justify paying someone millions and millions of pounds for sitting on the board of something. But who knows? Maybe that sort of thing will shift and change. It needs to be a societal shift.\u201d</p> <p>When societal shifts happen in Black Mirror \u2013 which migrated from Channel 4 to Netflix and was praised by the novelist Stephen King as \u201cterrifying, funny, intelligent\u201d \u2013 they usually come with a dark twist. The season-four episode Metalhead features a post-apocalyptic future where humans are hunted by robot dogs (\u201calmost like a tone poem of bleakness,\u201d he says). Brooker has little appetite to write in that vein right now, but points out that Black Mirror can be uplifting too \u2013 San Junipero was a love story with a happy ending \u2013 so we should not necessarily give up on a sixth season.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not writing stories about societies falling apart at the moment, so read into that what you will. If you look at classic dystopian stories, it becomes every man for himself immediately. Actually, in this crisis, what\u2019s happened is you\u2019re more likely to be sitting indoors watching Tiger King and worrying that your neighbour\u2019s OK and asking to see if they need you to bring in a bag of potatoes or whatever. What\u2019s actually happening at the moment is much more cohesive and heartening.</p> <p>\u201cAt the moment, if you were trying to write a story about a pandemic sweeping the world and everyone immediately turning on each other, plenty of people would look at that and go: \u2018Well, that isn\u2019t what\u2019s happened.\u2019 So there\u2019s plenty of room for bleak stories and horror movies \u2013 it\u2019s just I think you\u2019ve got to approach it slightly differently.\u201d</p> <p>Brooker was summed up on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Desert Island Discs as: \u201cSardonic, deadpan, scabrous and snarky ... and he\u2019s really got it in for politicians.\u201d But now a dad in his mellow fifth decade, it turns out he even has a place in his heart for Boris Johnson \u2013 up to a point.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at Boris Johnson getting ill, when he was in intensive care, I\u2019m not a fan of Boris Johnson but I was worried about him on some level. He\u2019s a human being with a kid on the way. Worrying about that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not worried about everything else. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not critical of things he\u2019s done or decisions he\u2019s taken. And also it doesn\u2019t give him a get-out-of-jail-free card. Now he\u2019s back in the saddle, it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t criticise the decisions that he\u2019s made.\u201d</p> <p>Brooker\u2019s assessment of Johnson as prime minister is unflattering. \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of the new, sort of slightly bolshie shrugging off of the truth that happens, the way they slightly adopted the fake news. Dominic Cummings swanning out of his house and telling journalists that they\u2019re all rich remainers. It\u2019s a sort of gaslighting that goes on.</p> <p>\u201cThat feels to me like a new thing, or a new sort of shamelessness, which I hope goes into a great big burning bin. And I hope everybody involved in that eventually finds themselves nowhere near any position of power or employment. If I think about that for more than 20 seconds, I can get very cross indeed.\u201d</p> <p>Brooker\u2019s imagination prepared him well for the world-changing pandemic. How does he feel about an event that can be predicted with absolute certainty next year: his 50th birthday? \u201cI\u2019m resigned to it now, I guess,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember turning 30 that was: \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m going to be 30,\u2019 and then that was OK, that was almost: \u2018Oh, actually, hang on, I\u2019m still young.\u2019 Turning 40 was a bit more like: \u2018Oh no, this isn\u2019t great.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cIn my head I\u2019ve been 50 for a while so I think I\u2019m going to deal with it. But that\u2019s probably why I\u2019m going out running and trying to use pull-up bars, because I\u2019m desperately trying to not die. But then, we all are.\u201d</p> <p><em>Charlie Brooker\u2019s Antiviral Wipe will be on BBC Two on Thursday at 9pm</em></p>",
  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Confirmed deaths worldwide pass 290,000</strong></h2> <p>According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 4,261,955 people around the world are known to have contracted the virus, while at least 291,964 have died since the pandemic began.<strong> </strong>The numbers, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to be significant underestimates due to suspected underreporting and differing recording and testing regimes.</p> <h2><strong>More than 147,000 Americans could die by early August \u2013 study</strong></h2> <p>A newly revised coronavirus mortality model predicts more than 147,000 Americans could die from Covid-19 by early August, up nearly 10,000 from the last projection, as restrictions for curbing the pandemic are increasingly relaxed, researchers said on Tuesday. The current US death toll stands at 82,376.</p> <h2><strong>Brazil reports record deaths</strong></h2> <p>Brazil reported a record <a href=\"https://covid.saude.gov.br/\">881 Covid-19</a> deaths in 24 hours on Tuesday, its health ministry said, taking its total to 12,400 and making it the world\u2019s sixth worst-affected country in terms of deaths, according to John Hopkins University <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">figures</a>. Its total of 177,589 confirmed cases is the world\u2019s seventh-highest.</p> <h2><strong>US Senate threatens sanctions on China over Covid-19 accounting</strong></h2> <p>US Republican senators proposed legislation Tuesday that would empower President Donald Trump to slap sanctions on China if Beijing does not give a \u201cfull accounting\u201d for the coronavirus outbreak. The legislation will give Trump 60 days to certify to Congress that China has provided a full accounting on the Covid-19 outbreak to an investigation that could be led by the United States and its allies, or a United Nations body like the World Health Organization.</p> <h2><strong>Wuhan prepares to test 11 million residents</strong></h2> <p>The Chinese city of Wuhan, the original centre of the pandemic, plans to test all 11 million residents for coronavirus, according to local media. It was widely believed that this will be done within 10 days. However, Chinese media reports have given some more clarity, suggesting that while there is a city-wide testing plan, the time limit is for each region on staggered start times.</p> <h2>Twitter announces employees will be allowed to work from home \u2018forever\u2019</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/12/twitter-coronavirus-covid19-work-from-home\">Twitter will allow its employees to work from home \u201cforever\u201d</a>, chief executive officer Jack Dorsey said in a company-wide email Tuesday. A spokesperson from Twitter confirmed the decision to the Guardian. Twitter has \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d working from home since 2 March and mandated employees to work from home starting 11 March. Employees who prefer to work remotely can now do so indefinitely, Twitter said in its statement. Those who want to return to the office will probably need to wait until at least September.</p> <h2><strong>India PM announces US$270bn virus economic package</strong></h2> <p>India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled a stimulus package for labourers and small businesses on Tuesday worth about 10% of India\u2019s GDP.<strong> </strong>The package came as the country was set to mark its 50th day in the world\u2019s biggest lockdown as the number of virus cases topped 70,000 with 2,200 deaths.<br><br></p>",
  "<p>Ramadan is a quiet affair in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/yemen\">Yemen</a> this year. \u201cPeople are very afraid,\u201d said Ahmed, an aid worker in the Houthi rebel-controlled capital, Sana\u2019a, who asked for his last name to be withheld. \u201cThere\u2019s no money, there\u2019s no healthcare and now you can\u2019t even celebrate iftar with family because of the coronavirus.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yemen, where five years of war have already created the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/07/yemen-heads-list-of-countries-facing-worst-humanitarian-disasters-in-2020\">worst humanitarian crisis</a> in the world, is uniquely vulnerable to the coronavirus pandemic. Despite a unilateral ceasefire announced by Saudi Arabia last month, there has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/fighting-escalates-in-yemen-despite-coronavirus-ceasefire\">an uptick in fighting between the Houthis and the Saudi and Emirati-led coalition</a> fighting on behalf of Yemen\u2019s government, as well as renewed hostilities between the coalition and separatist forces in the country\u2019s south.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/taiz-yemen-roads-to-normal-life-blocked-houthi\">In the rubble of Taiz, all roads to a normal life are blocked</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The fresh violence, combined with humanitarian funding shortfalls and cuts, means <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19</a> could not have arrived at a worse time.</p> \n<p>The latest World Health Organization (WHO) predictions estimate that even if the pandemic response is well-managed, at least 42,000 Yemenis will succumb to the virus. A worst-case scenario could see 93% of the around 30-million-strong population infected.</p> \n<p>While government areas have only reported 65 confirmed cases so far, and the Houthis in Sana\u2019a have only announced two cases, aid workers told the Guardian at least 70 cases have already been identified in rebel-controlled territory.</p> \n<p>In the southern city of Aden, which Yemen\u2019s national coronavirus committee has declared is \u201cinfested\u201d with the disease, unofficial reports say at least one doctor has died and three more are ill. Some private hospitals have closed their doors to patients, afraid their staff will become infected.</p> \n<p>Since April the rainy season has also brought widespread flooding and a rise in cholera cases \u2013 110,000 so far. The recent implosion of Lebanon\u2019s financial sector, where Yemeni banks have long kept dollar reserves, has also <a href=\"https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/9948\">severely affected</a> the flow of vital imports.</p> \n<p>\u201cA time like this is not the right time [for the international community] to cut aid programmes and funding,\u201d said a Yemeni aid worker who asked not to be identified to keep their organisation\u2019s work safe. \u201cIf they\u2019re trying to pressure the Houthis, it won\u2019t work. They have already shown they\u2019re not going anywhere. Ordinary people are the ones suffering.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Some donors, including the US, cut funding to UN programmes in Yemen earlier this year after consistent attempts by the Houthis to consolidate control over the management and distribution of resources: aid agencies report lengthy permit delays, as well as harassment and detention of staff.</p> \n<p>In a country where 80% of the population relies on aid, the cuts are already being felt \u2013 and their effect could be irreversible. The World Food Programme (WFP), for example, feeds 9.6 million Yemenis in Houthi areas, but has already had to halve food deliveries to every other month, which could easily push 10 million people already living on the brink of starvation into full-blown famine.</p> \n<p>Half of Yemen\u2019s medical facilities are currently out of action, the majority because of coalition bombing facilitated by US and UK arms sales and technical support. At existing facilities, the WHO has had to top up healthcare workers\u2019 salaries for years, but even that<a href=\"https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/news/2020/05/07/coronavirus-health-yemen-unpaid-world-health-organisation-cuts\"> lifeline was cut</a> last week in the wake of a \u00a3122m funding shortfall.</p> \n<p>The UN\u2019s Population Fund (UNFPA) also says that only 41% of its 2020 funding appeal has been met. If funds are not found by next week, 140 reproductive health centres will be forced to close, putting 48,000 pregnant women at risk of death from obstetric complications.</p> \n<p>Operating under the assumption there is now widespread transmission of coronavirus in Yemen, the WHO temporarily ordered a pause in staff activity on Saturday. More NGOs are likely to follow suit in order to keep their staff safe.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Most agencies\u2019 hopes are now pinned on a hastily announced donor pledging conference hosted by the UN and KS Relief, Saudi Arabia\u2019s main humanitarian arm, scheduled for 2 June. The US has also made a one-off donation of $225m (\u00a3183m) in emergency food aid as a stopgap for the WFP\u2019s Yemen programme.</p> \n<p>Such measures, Ahmed said, may be too little too late. \u201cI have to tell recipients there is nothing to give them. Maybe if these families can hang on they\u2019ll live just to get coronavirus. The damage is already being done right now.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hi Alyx. Why is everyone messaging me about Robert Pattinson\u2019s chaotic pasta?</strong></p> <p>Robert Pattinson, the Twilight star-turned-arthouse-powerhouse, has used his <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/robert-pattinson-on-batman-tenet-isolation-june-cover\">cover profile with GQ</a> as an opportunity to promote his dream business venture. A pasta dish with the same \u201cfast-food credentials as burgers and pizzas\u201d that \u201cyou can hold in your hand\u201d. He\u2019s calling it Piccolini Cuscino, or \u201cLittle Pillow\u201d.</p> <p>He attempted to demonstrate his prototype for Zach Baron, who interviewed him over FaceTime in isolation, and it involved cornflakes, burning a burger bun with a lighter, a large quantity of sugar, and exploding a microwave in the London apartment the producers of Batman are paying for him to live in. </p> <p>In other words \u2013 it is the perfect business opportunity for our times.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/olsencassidy/status/1260231023159382018\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Robert Pattinson making breakfast <a href=\"https://t.co/2qjd1Ysrw9\">pic.twitter.com/2qjd1Ysrw9</a></p>&mdash; Cassidy Olsen (@olsencassidy) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/olsencassidy/status/1260231023159382018?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 12, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>Sorry, cornflakes, a microwave and sugar? Is he trolling us?</strong></p> <p>In the words of Baron, who has written <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/robert-pattinson-on-batman-tenet-isolation-june-cover\">a truly excellent profile</a>, \u201ceven now, I don\u2019t totally know\u201d.<strong> </strong>Still, there\u2019s a long, ongoing pop culture legacy of discussing Pattinson\u2019s body odour (<a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2009/11/we_found_out_why_robert_pattin.html\">used to be bad</a>;<a href=\"https://www.thethings.com/robert-pattinson-used-to-smell-bad-now-he-just-smells-like-crayons/\"> now, according to Pattinson himself, like crayons</a>) Given that, it wouldn\u2019t be wildly out of step to assume his kitchen habits are also a little ... odd. At one point he describes a type of pasta as \u201clike a blob, a sort of squiggly blob \u2026 it looks like a sort of messy \u2026 like, the hair bun on a girl\u201d. (Our working theory is he\u2019s talking about tortellini).</p> <p>At another point, he frets: \u201cI literally did this yesterday. And now it\u2019s just impossible. It\u2019s going to look like I can\u2019t cook at all.\u201d</p> <p>Either way, you\u2019ve got to admire his commitment to the cause. He sets one of his latex gloves on fire while using a lighter to brand his creation with the initials \u201cPC\u201d. He allows \u201ca lightning bolt\u201d of electricity to destroy his microwave in the process of concocting this dish. And he pulls this stunt off without care for his personal safety. (It\u2019s unclear who\u2019ll pay for the broken microwave.)</p> <p>As for the sugar, he says: \u201cYou really need to congeal everything in an enormous amount of sugar and cheese\u201d \u2013 which is also my approach to cooking in lockdown, so fair enough.</p> <p>A commitment to chaos is pretty much Pattinson\u2019s MO, according to the directors he\u2019s worked with. In the profile Robert Eggers describes him as \u201cAndy Kaufman-esque in real life. Rob\u2019s so beyond dry that it\u2019s, like, meta. You\u2019re like, \u2018Is that funny?\u2019 Like, \u2018I have no idea what\u2019s going on.\u2019\u201d <br><br>In the piece, Pattinson also claims he can\u2019t remember the plot of Tenet, an upcoming movie he just starred in directed by Christopher Nolan. So Baron calls Nolan to see if he\u2019s being played. The response: \u201cThe interesting thing with Rob is, he\u2019s slightly fucking with you.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Is it possible that he, like everyone else, is simply going mad in iso?</strong></p> <p>More so than most people, Pattinson is used to being isolated. He\u2019s spent a lot of his life hiding from the paparazzi \u2013 once, famously <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/robert-pattinson-shacks-vacation-home-reese-witherspoon-report-article-1.1126393\">at Reese Witherspoon\u2019s house</a>, a titbit I think about too often.</p> <p>In the interview, he seems to be coping about as well as any of us. Even though he\u2019s meant to be playing Batman, he\u2019s barely working out (my hero) and he\u2019s taking great liberties with his Batman diet: \u201cI\u2019ll have oatmeal with, like, vanilla protein powder on it.

  "<p>On Wednesday morning, Bret Chiafolo will have the surreal experience of listening to a live broadcast from the quarantined US supreme court as it debates whether his behavior during the 2016 presidential election was in breach of the constitution.</p> <p>Chiafolo was one of seven so-called \u201cfaithless\u201d electors who made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/19/electoral-college-faithless-electors-donald-trump\">national headlines</a> four years ago as they made a long-shot attempt to stop Donald Trump ascending to the US presidency. In the process, they raised fundamental questions about the workings of America\u2019s arcane system for choosing the occupant of the White House.</p> <p>Unlike direct democracies, US presidents are not elected by the popular vote of the American people. Instead, they are selected by 538 members of the electoral college \u2013 electors as they are known \u2013 who are in turn selected by political parties in each state.</p> <p>That anomaly led to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/president\">victory of Trump</a> by 306 electoral votes to 232 for Clinton, even though she attracted the support of almost 3 million more Americans in the popular vote.</p> <p>Chiafolo, a Microsoft employee who lives outside Seattle, was one of the 538 members of the electoral college who in 2016 would technically decide the outcome of one of the most heated and ugly races in US history. Under normal circumstances, his vote would be a foregone conclusion \u2013 he would merely cast his ballot for the presidential candidate who had won his state of Washington, in this case Clinton.</p> <p>But Chiafolo had other ideas. He thought it more important to follow his own conscience and make a stand against Trump than to act like a \u201crobotic automaton\u201d, as he puts it, in following party lines.</p> <p>\u201cI had committed to put country before party \u2013 I believed it was my constitutional duty as an elector to oppose Donald Trump,\u201d he told the Guardian in an interview this week.</p> <p>Despite being a Democratic elector himself, he decided to vote for a moderate Republican, Colin Powell, in the hope that it would inspire other Republican electors in different states that Trump had won to withhold their vote from the president-elect. He was found in violation of state law and fined $1,000.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e23b0d0ee9015152d3d9966db450adb611605a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e23b0d0ee9015152d3d9966db450adb611605a3/0_162_4480_2689/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters at Georgia\u2019s capitol building call on members of the state electoral college to vote against Donald Trump.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters at Georgia\u2019s capitol building call on members of the state electoral college to vote against Donald Trump.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The case was brought to court and rose to the supreme court of Washington state, which upheld the fine. Chiafolo appealed to the US supreme court which will begin oral arguments on his case at 10am ET on Wednesday.</p> <p>Later the same day a similar case from Colorado will be deliberated.</p> <p>At the center of the proceedings is the question, does the US constitution invest the 538 electoral college members with individual will or are they just cogs in the country\u2019s peculiar form of democracy? <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/19/19-465/142789/20200501134340291_19-465ReplyBriefForPresidentialElectors.pdf\">Chiafolo argues</a> firmly he had the right to choose as he pleased \u2013 as implied by the word \u201celector\u201d \u2013 and it was his constitutional duty to exercise that discretion.</p> <p>He points to Alexander Hamilton\u2019s <a href=\"https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed68.asp\">Federalist Paper number 68</a>, which specifically empowers electors to guard against presidential candidates ill-equipped to lead the nation. Hamilton expressly singled out candidates who lack \u201crequisite qualifications\u201d, display \u201ctalents for low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity\u201d or who are susceptible to \u201cthe desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils\u201d.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/19/19-465/139629/20200401140652396_19-465_bs_State.pdf\">counter-arguments</a>, lawyers for Washington state have warned that if the supreme court allows electoral college members to vote according to their individual consciences it would have \u201cbizarre and dangerous consequences\u201d. It would give the 538 electors more power than the millions of American voters, and \u201cprofoundly undermine public confidence in the value of participating in our democracy\u201d.</p> <p>Chiafolo said Wednesday\u2019s oral arguments would help to answer a question that should have been settled 200 years ago: \u201cDo electors have the freedom of voters or are they simply robotic automatons. Personally, I think it was always clear that it was always intended that there should be individual choice.\u201d</p> <p>He said he expects it to be an uphill battle attempting to convince the nation\u2019s highest court. \u201cThe supreme court has been increasingly politicized over the years and that might affect the judgment,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Representing Chiafolo and another \u201cfaithless\u201d elector in the Colorado case will be Lawrence Lessig, a constitutional law professor at Harvard. He said the supreme court\u2019s decision was crucial at a time when the country was heading into another hotly contested presidential election.</p> <p>\u201cThis case is especially important in the context of this election, as we maintain that there should be a human check or safety valve in the process of selecting the president,\u201d Lessig told the Guardian.</p>"
