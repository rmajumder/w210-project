Reuter, just past the halfway line, moseyed infield from the right and played a square pass to Helmer. He surged into the space, clipped a pass infield to Moller on the edge of the D and kept running. Moller held off Adams and then Gascoigne before playing a nice reverse pass to Helmer \u2013 that\u2019s the centre-back, by the way - on the left side of the area.

Paul Ince, who was missed so badly on Saturday, returns from suspension to replace the newly suspended Gary Neville. The only slight surprise is the inclusion of David Platt ahead of Phil Neville, who most expected to be chosen to replace his brother. </p> <p>That means England will play with three rather than four at the back. Venables has obviously decided that this game is too big for a 19-year-old, even one as precocious as Neville. But his time will come; on the evidence of the last six months, he\u2019s going to be a superstar. </p> <p>The word from Wembley is that Klinsmann has bugger all chance of coming off the bench, even though he will sit among the German substitutes. His replacement is the 33-year-old Stefan Kuntz, who plays for Besiktas in Turkey \u2013 not, as some of you have suggested, for Nominative Determinism FC. </p> <p>Kuntz will play up front of his own.

Come on, did you really think football would be allowed to come home without first getting past the Germans? They\u2019re the Keyser Soze of world football: nine of the last 12 major tournaments involving European teams have been won by the Germans or the team that put them out. And it\u2019ll probably be 10 out of 13 come Sunday evening.</p> <p>Whoever wins at Wembley will go into the final as decent favourites against either France or the Czech Republic. That game is heading for a penalty shoot-out: it\u2019s 0-0 at Old Trafford with a few minutes of extra-time remaining. I was going to say it\u2019s been a stinker, but that would be overly generous.</p> <p>As in 1990, when a bereft Argentina waited in the final for the winners of England and West Germany, this feels like more than a semi-final. England and Germany have been the two best teams in the tournament, even allowing for England\u2019s occasionally obscene good fortune against Spain on Saturday. That win added to an already overwhelming sense of destiny \u2013 and, if we\u2019re being honest, slightly dangerous giddiness - up and down the country.</p> <p>There are two ways of looking at this Germany side. The first is that they are Germany, and Euro 96 was fun while it lasted. The second is that, as German sides go, they aren\u2019t <em>that </em>scary. Their captain Jurgen Klinsmann is a big doubt after limping off with a calf injury against Croatia \u2013 we\u2019ll have team news shortly \u2013 and, for all the brilliance of Andreas Moller and especially the sweeper Matthias Sammer, they aren\u2019t a patch on the awesome power team that won Italia 90. </p> <p>You could have a good pub braw- sorry, debate about whether England\u2019s class of 96 are better than the boys of 1990. This team has one undeniable edge: home advantage. The world has changed a lot since 1966, and upper lips are nowhere near as stiff as they once were. The atmosphere at Wembley tonight will be like nothing we\u2019ve heard before.</p> <p>The euphoria of the last 10 days is such that nobody seems to have considered the possibility England might not win tonight. Nobody is ready for the party to end. Nobody wants to stop fakkin shoutin\u2019 lager, lager, lager. </p> <p>This country is certainly going to have an almighty hangover tomorrow. But let\u2019s be clear about this: there are hangovers, and hangovers.

The shutdown of the economy is damaging. It is a balancing of risks. I think we will be in worse shape in the public health sector and the financial sector if we just unthinkingly send people back to business as usual.\u201d</p> <p>Even one of Trump\u2019s closest supporters, the Republican senator Lindsey Graham, has distanced himself from the president\u2019s position <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1242120623448621061\">in a tweet</a>, writing: \u201cTry running an economy with major hospitals overflowing, doctors and nurses forced to stop treating some because they can\u2019t help all, and every moment of gut-wrenching medical chaos being played out in our living rooms, on TV, on social media, and shown all around the world.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If we had been better prepared for coronavirus, the economy wouldn\u2019t be where it is right now</p> <footer> <cite>Michael Greenberger</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere is no functioning economy unless we control the virus.\u201d</p> <p>But Trump has pinned his re-election hopes on soaring stock markets and record lows in unemployment. Now with stock markets in freefall and jobs set to follow, he seems determined to press ahead and try to relax restrictions on business in an attempt to cure the economic crisis.</p> <p>Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, said such a move would probably fail, economically and politically. \u201cThe first question is: what will people do?\u201d she said.</p> <p>Gould said some people were likely not to return to work even if ordered to do so. Secondly, she said, it was clear that state governors \u2013 who have shut down so many cities \u2013 would resist any move from Trump that could worsen the escalating health crisis.</p> <p>Even in normal times, such a conflict would create a constitutional crisis. In the current situation it could be much worse.</p> <p>Greenberger said: \u201cIn your worst imaginations, and our worst imaginations have come alive in this episode, you could see serious tension between the active military deployed to enforce the opening of businesses and the state police who are enforcing the closures.\u201d</p> <p>Trump predicted Americans would see \u201cpacked churches\u201d this Easter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1242537995103846400\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Trump on why he picked Easter as the day he wants to end strict social distancing and reopen American businesses: &quot;Easter is a very special day for me ...

  "<p>It sounds preposterous in hindsight, especially now the Tokyo Olympics has joined the ranks of the sporting postponements, but barely a fortnight ago organisers could still see a rickety route towards hosting the Games in 2020.</p> \n<p>Japan and China appeared to be over the worst of the coronavirus epidemic, so the thinking went, and most of Europe was still open. So a decision was made: to push on, to wait, to hope.</p> \n<p>That hope continued to flicker, even as the World Health Organization declared a pandemic, major sports shut down, and more countries entered lockdown. The Olympic flame was lit on a still March morning in Olympia, Greece and Thomas Bach, the president of the International Olympic Committee, insisted there was \u201cno plan B\u201d. But on 17 March, there was a subtle, almost imperceptible, shift missed by almost everyone.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/24/tokyo-olympics-to-be-postponed-to-2021-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic\">Tokyo Olympics postponed to 2021 due to coronavirus pandemic</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Speaking after chatting to G7 leaders, Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said: \u201cI want to hold the Olympics and Paralympics perfectly, as proof that the human race will conquer coronavirus, and I gained support for that from the G7 leaders.\u201d</p> \n<p>To most people that sounded innocuous. But in the IOC and elsewhere, ears started to tingle. It was not what Abe had said. Rather, it was what he had not. For the first time, Japan\u2019s leader did not mention hosting the Games in July 2020.</p> \n<p>From that moment on the decision to postpone the Games was inevitable, according to multiple conversations with those inside the Olympic movement about how the world\u2019s greatest sporting event came to be put back a year. The big question now was when \u2013 and how \u2013 it would happen.</p> \n<p>But it appears it was actually the Japanese who were the most reluctant to move the Games \u2013 while Bach was actively if quietly pushing for a postponement for some time. The problem was that the IOC could not move unless it got the Tokyo organisers on board. And that, to put it mildly, was not straightforward.</p> \n<p>The greatest difficulty was that the Japanese could not be seen to lose face. Another was that organisers were keen on holding the Games in October, while Bach felt it had to be 2021 because there was no guarantee that the Covid-19 virus would be under control by the autumn. A third problem was that Tokyo <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/22/ioc-expected-to-make-decision-on-tokyo-2020-olympics-within-four-weeks\" title=\"\">wanted a four-week deadline</a> to work through the issues \u2013 something the IOC reluctantly granted on Sunday.</p> \n<p>But that did not stop Bach stealthily putting the wheels in motion to bring the deadline forward. It was not a coincidence that the Australian Olympic Committee was one of the first to call for the Games to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/23/australian-athletes-told-to-prepare-for-olympic-games-in-2021\" title=\"\">moved to 2021</a>. The AOC\u2019s president, John Coates, is a close friend of Bach \u2013 and chair of the IOC\u2019s coordination commission for Tokyo. Bach knew he needed more negotiating cards. This was one of his strongest.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4da3b08e12f7e46a9fd3d3bb6fa519e9de47d224\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4da3b08e12f7e46a9fd3d3bb6fa519e9de47d224/0_239_4760_2856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tokyo Aquatics Centre\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 15,000-seat Tokyo Aquatics Centre is another venue that will now lie dormant for up to 12 months before the rescheduled Olympics take place.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kazuhiro Nogi/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As Michael Payne, a former senior marketing executive at the IOC who still has close ties to the Olympic movement, explains: \u201cThe IOC was both officially and through its back channels clearly applying major pressure to get to a quick decision, because it realised that the delay was damaging to athletes and their preparations.\u201d Payne, who handled the $1bn deal between Chinese group Alibaba and the IOC, adds: \u201cBut there was also a lot of political negotiations and delicate diplomacy involved to make sure the Japanese don\u2019t lose face.\u201d</p> \n<p>That explains why the IOC was happy for Abe to \u201cpropose\u201d a delay on Tuesday \u2013 which, of course, Bach quickly accepted. How could it not be, given the ever-sharpening criticisms from athletes who questioned why the IOC needed so long to reach a decision. Dina Asher-Smith, the world 200m champion, was particularly blunt: \u201cDoes this mean that athletes face up to another FOUR weeks of finding ways to fit in training \u2013 whilst potentially putting ourselves, coaches, support staff, and loved ones at risk just to find out they were going to be postponed anyway?\u201d</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Dai Greene, the former 400m hurdles world champion, said he was having to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/23/dai-greene-tokyo-olympic-2020-games-must-be-postponed\" title=\"\">flip tractor tyres</a> on his partner\u2019s farm and use bales of hay for box jumps because gyms were shut. \u201cOn Saturday morning, I went to recce the local 400m track by one of the private schools near where I live,\u201d he added. \u201cI even had a look at the fence and wondered to myself \u2013 can I jump over it?\u201d</p> \n<p>Greene was lucky. With Britain in lockdown, most athletes could barely train at all.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"19c1502c-287f-4589-8d1b-ef360eccdb91\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-DNXY0T6QvY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Guardian understands the British Olympic Association also took a strong position in talks with the IOC last week. While offering its support for hosting the Games in July, it came with a heavy caveat: if British athletes were unable to train because of the Covid-19 outbreak, the BOA would publicly call for the Games to be postponed.</p> \n<p>The BOA also increasingly felt that morally there was no way it could take a team to the Olympics in the midst of a pandemic. How, as one source put it, could they justify taking team doctors away from a national health crisis? Especially when its chief medical officer, Niall Elliott, was on the front line in Scotland?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A private opinion poll of more than 1,000 people reinforced the BOA\u2019s position. It found that only 5% of Britons wanted the Games to go ahead in July. So what now? It is almost certain the Olympics \u2013 which will still be branded Tokyo 2020 \u2013 will be staged in July 2021, although some IOC members have raised the prospect of a \u201ccherry blossom\u201d Games next April. That seems unlikely. Would the US media giant NBC, one of the IOC\u2019s biggest financial backers, really want a Games to clash with the latter stages of the NBA season?</p> \n<p>It would almost certainly be easier to try again in July next year. World Athletics has already indicated that it will be happy to shift its 2021 championships, which are due to take place in Eugene, to 2022, and Fina, the organisers of the 2021 swimming world championships in Japan in July, has indicated it too could reschedule.</p> \n<p>Of course there will still be major headaches \u2013 not least ensuring that venues can be freed up for whenever the Games take place. As Sebastian Coe, who ran the London 2012 Games and now heads World Athletics, put it after the IOC\u2019s announcement: \u201cThere is no project management that challenges a city or country like the Olympics does,\u201d and the cost to organisers from the delay is expected to be at least \u00a32bn.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/24/olympics-tokyo-2020-coronavirus-postponed-q-and-a\">Olympics Q&amp;A: What now for the Tokyo Games? | Simon Burnton</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Some of the headaches, however, may not be as great as assumed. The IOC will still get millions in broadcasting and sponsor revenues so long as the event takes place, much of which it will pass on to the sports movement. And while there has been some ill-informed speculation about whether a new athletes\u2019 village will have to be built, that is not a major concern given the 5,500 apartments in the village sold on to private owners for use after the Games do not have to be delivered to them until 2023 \u2013 and, as yet, only 500 have been sold. Meanwhile, among those in the Olympic movement there is a hope that the Tokyo Games in 2021 will become a joyous celebration of humanity and harmony after the devastation of coronavirus \u2013 much like the Salt Lake City Winter Games in 2002 helped America heal after September 11.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe leaders agreed that the Olympic Games in Tokyo could stand as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times, and that the Olympic flame could become the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present,\u201d the IOC said in a statement.</p> \n<p>Such pronouncements usually sound trite. But, in these dark and uncertain times, it struck pretty much the perfect note.</p>",
  "<p>Most of us are familiar with the remains of cuttlefish, <em>Sepia officinalis, </em>large chalky internal shells that are washed up on beaches and sold in pet shops as a source of calcium for birds.</p> <p>This relative of the squid and octopus thrives in the seas around Britain and is caught in large numbers for our continental neighbours who regard them as a culinary delicacy. Europeans also use their ink as a colouring agent in food, ink and paint.</p> <p>Owing to over-exploitation, cuttlefish have just been declared an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/12/cuttlefish-added-to-red-food-list-after-stocks-decline-in-channel\">endangered species along the south coast</a>. Next month they will be coming into shallow water to breed and lay their rubbery black eggs, known as sea grapes, on seaweed and sea grass.</p> <p>They are remarkable partly because they can change colour at will to match their background but also use this talent in dazzling courtship displays. More recently, scientists have discovered that they are both intelligent and have good memories.</p> <p>While cuttlefish eat lots of things, including crabs, their favourite food is shrimps. In a series of experiments using captive specimens, <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2019.0743\">scientists</a> discovered that they could remember routines and be patient.

  "<p>In the impactful new Netflix documentary Crip Camp, we\u2019re told a story so remarkable that it seems as if we should already know it or at least have a vague awareness of its existence. It starts with something small, a camp in upstate New York for those with disabilities, and ends with something big, an impassioned civil rights movement that led to vital systemic change. Like many of the best documentaries, more and more of which have been cropping up on Netflix, it educates us on an underrepresented minority, adding nuance and specificity to an experience that might have previously been painted in broad strokes, the kind of film that shouldn\u2019t just be recommended viewing but also required.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/20/tiger-king-joe-exotic-netflix-series\">Murder, madness and tigers: behind the year's wildest Netflix series</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Premiering to great acclaim earlier this year at Sundance, after securing the Obamas as executive producers, Crip Camp is in itself the small film that became something big, now reaching millions of, quite literally given the pandemic, captive viewers. It starts in 1971 in the Catskills at Camp Jened, a loose, free-spirited camp designed for teens with disabilities. It was a utopia for kids who felt alienated and sidelined, a rare haven devoid of judgment and discrimination, an eye-opening experience for so many who\u2019d felt shut out for so long. The teens who\u2019d previously been rejected were suddenly accepted, moving from high school classes in the basement out into the light.</p> <p>Directors Nicole Newnham and Jim LeBrecht immerse us at Jened through an invaluable amount of vintage footage as well as interviews with surviving participants. The freewheeling vibe of the camp, likened to Woodstock, is matched by a similarly unstructured first act which sits us with the teens as they play, smoke, flirt and, most interestingly, discuss key issues with each other. For so many of them, this was their first opportunity to speak about the intricacies of their experience, which admittedly were different given their range of disabilities, but there\u2019s a thrill in watching them bond, especially in one illuminating scene where they lament the lack of alone time they\u2019re allowed, protective parents never far away.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrIs22plz0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XRrIs22plz0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>But the camp is only the beginning and once the teens leave after the summer of 71, the film moves on to what life looked like and how that formative experience left an indelible impression. It was no longer acceptable to live in the background, to accept status as second-class citizens, and so many of them used this newfound, or newly awakened, energy to demand political change. The inarguable breakout star of the film is Judy Heumann, who was a counsellor at the camp and went on to lead the movement, fearlessly confronting a system that was intimidatingly stacked against her. She\u2019s a captivating central figure, persuasively, passionately petitioning for equity and in one of the film\u2019s most powerful moments, when certain legislation is passed, she poignantly refuses to be grateful for the basic right of an accessible bathroom.</p> <p>It\u2019s a film that takes small, incremental leaps until we\u2019re finally made aware of the bigger picture, of the brave strides made by people who met at a camp and realised that what they were being offered in their lives wasn\u2019t good enough. It\u2019s rousing stuff, especially when we see how Black Panthers and LGBTQ+ activists at the time rallied alongside, aware that their individual fights were ultimately not that different, and it\u2019s one that\u2019s similarly not over. The shameful lack of wheelchair access within New York\u2019s subway system, which the film traces back to callous decision-making in the 70s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/30/new-york-transit-accessibility-mother-death-fall\">remains a major problem</a> while disability groups have filed a complaint about Covid-19-based discrimination <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/23/820398531/people-with-disabilities-say-rationing-care-policies-violate-civil-rights\">just this week</a>.</p> <p>There\u2019s understandable anger here but also humour and insight, Newnham and LeBrecht allowing those in the film to be seen as sexual, ambitious, funny, interesting individuals, more than what society has too often allowed. It\u2019s as involving as it is necessary, a rare ray of sunshine on yet another cloudy day.</p> <ul> <li><p>Crip Camp is available on Netflix from 25 March</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>Once upon a time, wise elders foretold that east and west would meet, a reviving and ruling power coming together in new leadership. The idea of a <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-united-states-and-china-a-g-2-in-the-making/\" title=\"\">Sino-American G2</a>, reaching bilateral consensus on key issues to prudently steer the international community, always sounded like a fairytale. But from this moment in time, it seems more like a bad joke. As a pandemic threatens millions of lives, and further suffering through a global recession, the shortcomings of China and the US are increasingly glaring.</p> <p>Chinese authorities covered up the Wuhan outbreak and harassed those who tried to blow the whistle, allowing the coronavirus to spread within and then beyond its borders \u2013 though subsequent draconian measures appear to have contained the internal spread, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/life-after-lockdown-has-china-really-beaten-coronavirus\" title=\"\">for now at least</a>, and should have bought time for other countries to prepare. Chinese diplomats and state media <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gerryshih/status/1240843170620948480\" title=\"\">promoted wild conspiracy theories</a> suggesting the virus originated, or was even created, in the US, even if officials may now be drawing back. Last week, with everyone\u2019s attention on the pandemic, Beijing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/18/us-media-accuse-china-of-cold-war-mentality-after-move-to-expel-journalists\" title=\"\">threw out US journalists</a> from major news organisations in belated retaliation for tightened controls on Chinese state media companies in the US.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Donald Trump spent weeks dismissing concerns and suggested the virus would \u201cdisappear\u201d and was \u201cvery well under control\u201d. He ceded responsibility to states and now wants to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/trumps-push-to-shorten-the-coronavirus-shutdown-proves-the-captain-is-flying-blind\" title=\"\">return to business as usual</a>, as if that were possible \u2013 even as the World Health Organization <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/us-may-become-centre-of-coronavirus-pandemic-who-says\" title=\"\">warns</a> that America could become the new centre of the pandemic.

He has, until this week, insisted on referring to \u201cthe Chinese virus\u201d despite the resulting stigma and hate crime.</p> <p>Mr Trump may yet regret his finger-pointing; many materials needed for equipment such as masks are mainly produced in China. Pundits have blamed predatory pricing by Chinese firms for ending penicillin and aspirin production in the US, but the US has also showed complacency in failing to protect key national resources and relying on foreign production.</p> <p>Washington\u2019s failures are allowing Beijing, despite its own culpability, to restore its image and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/efdec278-6d01-11ea-9bca-bf503995cd6f\" title=\"\">build foreign influence</a>. \u201cThe only country that can help us is China \u2026 European solidarity does not exist,\u201d declared the Serbian president, Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, last week; masks and health experts arrived days later. China\u2019s dispatches of medical supplies to other countries are welcome; so presumably were the shipments it received from the EU when the outbreak emerged, and the equipment that European neighbours have shared with each other. The EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3076728/eu-fires-warning-shot-china-coronavirus-battle-narratives\" title=\"\">warned</a> on Tuesday of a \u201cstruggle for influence\u201d, including through the \u201cpolitics of generosity\u201d. The bloc must show that solidarity is not an empty phrase, he wrote.</p> <p>The pandemic has underscored the need for international cooperation. When problems are global, solutions must be too. But it has also shown once more that China and the US are neither fit to lead, nor interested in cooperation, and that the rest of the world will need to find its own ways of working together.</p>",

The sharp acceleration in cases \u2013 just two weeks ago the official number was less than 2,000 \u2013 has led to the WHO warning that the US is overtaking countries such as Italy as the global hotspot for the virus.</p> <p>The true scale of infection in the US is almost certainly far worse, with a severe lack of testing having stymied efforts to contain Covid-19 once it emerged near Seattle. Trump initially referred to media coverage of the outbreak as a \u201choax\u201d before banning travel from China, where the virus originated, and claiming it had been nearly vanquished on US soil.</p> <p>But the US response has been hobbled by the administration\u2019s rejection of standard WHO testing kits, instead opting to develop its own, which turned out to be faulty. The Trump administration previously dismantled a federal team working on pandemics and cut back a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) group based in China tasked with tracking new threats such as Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cThe administration has repeatedly and systematically corroded critical parts of the CDC,\u201d said Christopher Sellers, an expert in the environment and health at Stony Brook University. \u201cThis was just begging for an epidemic to hit us. It was a perfect storm of lack of preparation.\u201d</p> <p>Muddled messaging from the White House, where Trump has often contradicted the sombre warnings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/trump-fauci-meme-coronavirus-response\">his top infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci</a>, has done little to Americans stop congregating on beaches or in shopping malls.</p> <p>State governors have taken up the mantle, shutting down public gatherings and non-essential businesses. But a paucity of medical supplies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/coronavrirus-medical-staff-beg-for-masks-social-media\">has led doctors and nurses to beg for items online</a>. Dressmakers have been asked to make masks for hospital workers. As one hospital\u2019s equipment supply diminished, one anesthesiologist wore a plastic bag over his head during a procedure.</p> <p>These shortages have only worsened pre-existing problems. Nearly one in 10 Americans have no health insurance, while a widespread lack of sick pay across the country has forced many ill people into work despite the risk of spreading the virus.</p> <p>New York City, now at a standstill, faces a tsunami of sick and dying people. More than 2,600 people have been hospitalized in New York state with more than 150 deaths so far.</p> <p>The \u201cattack rate\u201d of the virus \u2013 the percentage of the population infected \u2013 is five times higher than in other parts of the country, leading Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, to warn: \u201cTo all of my friends and colleagues in New York, this is the group that needs to absolutely social distance and self-isolate at this time.\u201d</p> <p>Authorities in New York are scouring the world for the ventilators, masks and gowns needed for an unfolding public health emergency that is expected to peak in the next three weeks.</p> <p>The Javits Center, a hulking glass conference space in Manhattan, has been transformed into a field hospital, with 2,000 beds installed.</p> <p>\u201cThe apex of this pandemic is higher and sooner than we thought,\u201d said Andrew Cuomo, the New York governor who has garnered praise for his handling of the crisis. \u201cI will turn this state upside down to get the hospital beds we need.\u201d</p> <p>Cuomo also condemned Fema and the Trump administration again, saying: \u201cYou want a pat on the back for sending 400 ventilators? What are we going to do with 400 ventilators when we need 30,000 ventilators? You\u2019re missing the magnitude of the problem, and the problem is defined by the magnitude.\u201d</p> <p>The number of cases was higher in New York, he said, \u201cbecause it started here first because we have global travelers coming here first. Because we have more density than other places. You will see this in suburban communities across the country. We are just a test case. We are just a test case. And that\u2019s how the nation should look at it. Where we are today, you will be in three weeks or five weeks or six weeks.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/older-people-would-rather-die-than-let-covid-19-lockdown-harm-us-economy-texas-official-dan-patrick\">Older people would rather die than let Covid-19 harm US economy \u2013 Texas official</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But even as leaders such as Cuomo scramble to cope with an steep increase of sick patients while urging people to stay at home and avoid social contact, Trump has signaled that he is prepared to wind down restrictions at the end of a 15-day window in an attempt to bolster the economy and a sagging stock market.</p> <p>\u201cOur country wasn\u2019t built to be shut down,\u201d Trump said on Monday. \u201cThis is not a country that was built for this. America will again, and soon, be open for business. I\u2019m not looking at months, I can tell you right now.\u201d</p> <p>That stance, a reversal on previous assertions that the US was \u201cat war\u201d, put the president once again on a collision course with governors and public health experts.</p> <p>For tens of millions of anxious Americans, the coming weeks will probably shape the contours of the crisis.</p>",

Rather, it was the daily government coronavirus press conference, being chaired for the first time by Hanock. Boris Johnson has fronted most of them since they started eight days ago.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hancock said that the government had brought 3.5m antibody testing kits, to show whether people had had coronavirus, and that a new testing facility in Milton Keynes had opened today. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I understand why NHS staff, in particular, and others across public service are so keen to get the testing ramped up, that we need to see and that we are undertaking.</p> \n   <p>Of course it really matters for getting people getting back to work, so we have now bought 3.5m antibody tests.</p> \n   <p>That will allow people to see whether they have had the virus and are immune to it and then can get back to work.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He also said 7.5m pieces of protective equipment including facemasks had been shipped out in the last 24 hours.<br></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hancock implicitly blamed Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, for overcrowding on some London tube trains today.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/24/uk-coronavirus-live-news-lockdown-boris-johnson-sports-direct-abandons-talk-of-opening-stores-as-gove-clarifies-scope-of-lockdown-rules?page=with:block-5e79e6228f08cc9a819474b0#block-5e79e6228f08cc9a819474b0\">10.52am </a>for some video footage.) Asked about the problem, Hancock said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When it comes to the tube, the first and the best answer is that Transport for London [which is run by Khan] should have the tube running in full so that people travelling on the tube are spaced out and can be further apart - obeying the two-metre rule wherever possible.</p> \n   <p>And there is no good reason in the information that I\u2019ve seen that the current levels of tube provision should be as low as they are. We should have more tube trains running.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Generally the political figures from the UK government, the opposition, the devolved administrations and the major mayoralties who have been engaged in the coronavirus crisis have so far kept recriminations to a minimum. Perhaps Hancock\u2019s comment is a sign that this is changing, because it was a clear dig at Khan. Earlier Khan himself openly criticised the government, saying that he had wanted to close construction sites but that he had been overruled by Boris Johnson. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/24/uk-coronavirus-live-news-lockdown-boris-johnson-sports-direct-abandons-talk-of-opening-stores-as-gove-clarifies-scope-of-lockdown-rules?page=with:block-5e7a25558f08d17da4d88b2b#block-5e7a25558f08d17da4d88b2b\"> 3.21pm.)</a></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Jenny Harries, the chief medical officer for England, said that couples who live apart should ideally stay apart - or else use coronavirus to \u201ctest the strength of their relationship\u201d and move in together.</strong> She was responding to an invitation to clarify whether the government advice meant that couples who did not live in the same house should stop seeing each other. After Hancock ducked the question and passed it over to her, Harries replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If you are two individuals, two halves of the couple, living in separate households then ideally they should stay in those households.</p> \n   <p>The alternative might be that, for quite a significant period going forward, they should just test the strength of their relationship and decide whether they should be permanently be resident in another household.</p> \n   <p>What we do not want is people switching in and out of households. It defeats the purpose of reductions in social interactions and will allow the transmission of disease.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hancock said he was launching a scheme inviting up to 250,000 people to volunteer to contribute to the fight against coronavirus.</strong> He explained:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Today we launch NHS volunteers. We are seeking a quarter of a million volunteers, people in good health to help the NHS, for shopping, for the delivery of medicines and to support those who are shielding to protect their own health.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that 11,788 recently retired NHS staff had responded to the call to return to the service.</strong> They included 2,660 doctors, more than 2,500 pharmacists and other staff and 6,147 nurses, he said.

She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This material should soon provide considerable relief in Italy, Spain and in 23 more member states. Now it is up to the member states to sign the necessary contracts swiftly.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The commission said it expected the equipment to be available two weeks after the member states leading the procurement sign the contracts. </p> \n  <p>Two other procurement schemes, to supply ventilators and laboratory equipment needed for coronavirus testing, are at an earlier stage, with calls for tenders launched last week. Nearly all EU countries, 25 out of 27, are participating in the procurement scheme on ventilators, while 19 are joining forces to buy laboratory equipment. </p> \n  <p>The Brexit transition agreement means the government has the right to take part in EU joint procurement. Under David Cameron, the government signed the EU\u2019s joint procurement agreement in 2014, which was drawn up after some member states experienced shortages of medical kit during the H1N1 pandemic.</p> \n  <p>The logic behind joint procurement is to reduce administration, get better prices through bulk purchasing power and take advantage of medical purchasing skills that may not be equally shared (something especially useful for smaller countries).</p> \n  <p>British officials have not ruled out joining an EU procurement scheme and stress the NHS will get everything it needs to tackle the pandemic. Meanwhile Boris Johnson recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/16/vauxhall-owner-psa-car-shuts-european-plants-amid-coronavirus-fears\">called on manufacturers to make 20,000 ventilators \u201cat speed\u201d</a>, as the government prepares for a surge in people needing intensive care. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-24T16:20:44.612Z\">at 4.20pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7a2efa8f08c78e185cff38\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-24T16:03:04.872Z\">4.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Grant Shapps</strong>, the transport secretary, says he is asking retired rail staff to return to work to cover for any shortages generated by coronavirus.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/grantshapps/status/1242478808357154823\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">To ensure those who absolutely-need-to-travel are able to safely I\u2019m requesting the rail industry ask retired staff including signallers to assist in this great national effort to beat <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirusuk?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#coronavirusuk</a>.

Describing the experience of those abroad, she said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>An inability to get through to consular services on the phone, a standard acknowledgement email telling them to contact their tour operator, airline or insurer, an increasing inability to find accommodation. Hotels are shutting, flights are cancelled, borders are closed and there are no routes home. Many are hours away from large airports in countries operating curfews.</p> \n   <p>To them, it looks like [Raab\u2019s] words of last week were empty and I ask him today as I asked him last week to explain how he is working with airlines with unused planes, parked at airports around the globe to bring our people home. He must get the process fully under way. The vision of British citizens sleeping rough on the streets of Caracas is not a good one.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Raab replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>She said that embassies had been closed. Actually it\u2019s a very small number of posts that have to be closed \u2026</p> \n   <p>A large chunk of the consular staff work from home.

chancellor, told MPs a few minutes ago about why constructing a scheme to protect the self-employed who are losing work because of the coronavirus crisis was so complicated. He said it may require a brand new system. He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019re looking at pace at what support can be provided.</p> \n   <p>The fact is that [the 5m group] that we\u2019re dealing with contains such a wide variety of different people where we don\u2019t have the ability to target support - that\u2019s the challenge that we have in designing something that gets to the people that we want it to help whilst at the same time being affordable, not having to benefit absolutely everybody.</p> \n   <p>That is proving to be problematic, but we are hard at work on it.</p> \n   <p>In terms of delivery, it is almost certainly going to be the case that we would have to build another brand new system to deliver any support.</p> \n   <p>I think it\u2019s right, and I\u2019m sure honourable members on both sides of this house would agree, that in terms of prioritising system design, the scheme we have set up for 90% of the workforce that is employed should be delivered first and quickly, and that is what we have committed to do, ideally by the end of April.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Labour\u2019s <strong>Wes Streeting </strong>pushed him for clarification on this. He said people wanted an announcement very soon.</p> \n  <p>Sunak said that he \u201choped to have something to say very shortly\u201d. But he said that did not mean he would be able to implement a scheme immediately.

Here are the key points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Gove only partially rejected claims that the government had acted too late, saying that this would be for others to judge in the future.</strong> <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-03-23/debates/F4D06B4F-56CD-4B60-8306-BAB6D78AC7CF/CoronavirusBill#contribution-42294916-A34B-4479-844E-85E9BFA637B4\">In the Commons yesterday</a> <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong>, the former foreign secretary, former health secretary and former Tory leadership candidate, said that \u201cit may be too late\u201d to avoid the UK following Italy. Hunt said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One London hospital has seven doctors with the virus in just that one hospital. Yet still people are going to shops, parks, beaches and holiday homes as if nothing has changed. It may be too late to avoid following Italy, but to have any chance at all of doing so we must move now to lockdown rules that ban non-essential travel. It is time not just to ask people to do social distancing, but to enforce those social distancing rules\u2014not next week, not this week, but right away.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>On Sky News <strong>Kay Burley</strong> asked Gove about Hunt\u2019s comment and how he thought history would look back at the way the UK has handled this, Gove replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think the most important thing now is not to look back, but to do everything that we can in order to ensure that the instructions that are being put in place are being followed. People will form their own judgment at some point in the future. What I\u2019m concerned about now is making sure that we do everything possible to protect the NHS, and that means that wherever possible people should stay at home.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked again if the government had acted too late, Gove said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019ve followed advice at every stage on what is the appropriate measure to take, and I think that\u2019s the right thing to do. In a democracy it is perfectly understandable that people have a range of views and disagree. Judgments can be formed now. Judgments will be formed in due course. I think the most important thing now, though, is to do everything that we can now, as individuals in our communities and in government, to follow the steps that will limit the spread of this disease.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Gove initially sidestepped a question about whether the government was still expecting hundreds of thousands of deaths before the coronavirus outbreak was contained. </strong>When pressed on this, he said it would depend on what people did.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He suggested the rules announced last night could be made even stricter. </strong>He told Burley:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We will review in three weeks\u2019 time exactly who how these measures are working. Let me be clear: this is a public health emergency, a national emergency. We must do everything that we can to stop this virus spreading. The prime minister said in his statement if the virus spreads in an unconstrained way, it will overwhelm the health services of any nation. So that is why we are taking the steps that we are taking ... We will keep it under review. And in three weeks\u2019 time we will be able to say whether or not the path that we\u2019ve followed needs any further intensification, or whether there are one or two of the existing restrictions that may be capable of being lifted.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KayBurley/status/1242372505911857162\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\"In three weeks time we'll be able to say whether or not the path we've followed needs intensification.\"<br><br>Cabinet boss <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michaelgove?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@michaelgove</a> says the government will assess whether they can lift lockdown restrictions at the end of three weeks.

  "<p>The musician Manu Dibango, who has died aged 86 after contracting Covid-19, covered a vast spectrum of styles, from traditional African roots music to jazz, soul, Afrobeat, reggae, gospel, French chanson, Congolese rumba, salsa and solo piano. Most importantly, he was a founding father of funk.</p> <p>In 1972 he made his mark with the hit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0CeFX6E2yI\" title=\"\">Soul Makossa</a>. As soon as it was released, as the B-side of a tribute to the Cameroon football team, there were at least five different cover versions in the American charts. The use of the refrain \u201cmama-say, mama-sa, mama-kossa\u201d, on Michael Jackson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Uj3zitETs4\" title=\"\">Wanna Be Starting Something</a>, from his 1982 album Thriller, earned Dibango substantial compensation two decades later.</p> <p>Dibango was an unmistakable figure, with a shaved head, shades, a benign grin and a deep, reverberating laugh. The instantly recognisable tone of his music was always swinging, melodic and invigorating. Although best known as a saxophonist, Dibango was also a consummate keyboard and vibraphone player and a great arranger, who could get the best from a quartet or a 28-piece orchestra.</p> <p>As he once said: \u201cWhat is special is that Africa has a long historical relationship with sound, and a communion between sound and the visual stronger than in any other culture. The sound carries the rhythm and the movement creates the images. The way an African moves compared with the environment is different from the western conception.\u201d</p> <p>Emmanuel Dibango was born in Douala, in French-administered Cameroon. His father was a high-ranking civil servant, his mother a fashion designer, and both parents were devout Protestants who disapproved of secular music. Manu received encouragement from the musical director of his church choir, and surreptitiously broadened his musical perspective with a bamboo flute and a home-made guitar. In 1944 he was in the school choir for the state visit of Charles de Gaulle to Cameroon.</p> <p>During the second world war, West Africa provided many reluctant recruits to the allied forces and Dibango would recall helping to cut loose the ropes binding \u201cvolunteers\u201d press-ganged into the French army. One of them was an uncle of his.</p> <p>In 1949 his parents sent him to France to study and, as an incentive, promised to pay for music lessons. He arrived on a steamer to take up his education at Saint-Calais in the region of Sarthe. The only black child in this small country town, he got on well with his schoolmates, who remembered him bringing the first bananas they had ever seen. For his part, he found snow exotic and tried to post some home in an envelope.</p> <p>He was adopted by the community and settled quickly into the French way of life, but his individuality, his cultural roots and, possibly, memories of the \u201cvolunteers\u201d, prevented him from accepting the complete national identity expected by his host country. Due to his parents having different ethnic backgrounds, he was never satisfied with an imposed identity. He was unhappy to be classified as an African musician, preferring to be considered as an artist, and an African.</p> <p>Considered too old to take up the violin, his preferred instrument, he studied classical piano for four years. His fellow students included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/jan/30/101-strangest-spotify-francis-bebey\" title=\"\">Francis Bebey</a>, who would become a novelist and musicologist, with whom Dibango played classical and jazz pieces, although for student dances they became a blues band.</p> <p>While he was on holiday in 1953, a friend lent him a saxophone and Dibango took to the instrument, enrolling for two years of private tuition. After doing the rounds of French jazz clubs he moved to Belgium, where his soulful style attracted the owner of the Bantou club. Within months Dibango had been signed up by Joseph Kabasele, the founding father of modern Congolese music, whose band, African Jazz, spearheaded a musical revolution in Africa. In Brussels he also met his future wife Marie-Josee (known as Coco), whom he married in 1957.</p> <p>In 1959 Kabasele recorded the pan-African anthem Ind\u00e9pendence Cha Cha and invited Dibango to the Congolese capital, L\u00e9opoldville (now Kinshasa), to work with him. They made many hit records for the Ngoma label in the prevailing rumba style. Dibango also ran a recording band called African Soul in which he played the organ on his own interpretations of American music. He managed a nightclub, the Tam Tam, but despite financial success he and Coco experienced racism, so they moved to Abidjan in Ivory Coast.</p> <p>After a period as leader of the Ivoirian national broadcast orchestra, Dibango realised that the creative \u201cmiracle\u201d he thought he was observing in Africa had turned into a mirage, and he returned to France.</p> <p>In the late 1960s and early 70s he recorded film soundtracks \u2013 including that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jun/12/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">Ousmane Semb\u00e8ne</a>\u2019s celebrated feature, Ceddo (1976) \u2013 incidental background music and commercials, and singles for the African market.</p> <p>In 1972 he joined the Congo rumba combo <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=pqSEKbu_Mlw\" title=\"\">Ry-Co Jazz</a> for a tour of Algeria, along with the guitarist Jerry Malekani, who thereafter became his permanent accompanist. Following the death of the US tenor sax supremo King Curtis in 1971, Dibango released a tribute single which identified the American as a major influence on his technique. In 1978 he recorded two albums for Chris Blackwell\u2019s Island label in Jamaica, Afrovision and Gone Clear.</p> <p>In 1982 Dibango worked on a masterful triple album, Fleurs Musicales du Cameroun, which gathered contemporary and traditional musicians from the various ethnic groups of Cameroon.</p> <p>In the same year he toured France with the American jazz trumpeter <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-don-cherry-1578669.html\" title=\"\">Don Cherry</a>, exploring everything from soul to Malian folk music and Thelonious Monk. Soon after, he was blowing ice-cold funk on his album Electric Africa (1985), which featured Herbie Hancock, and the hit single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ph5GB8RArks\" title=\"\">Abele Dance</a>. He collaborated with a long list of top class performers: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/23/hugh-masekela-obituary\" title=\"\">Hugh Masekela</a>, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-fela-kuti-1243789.html\" title=\"\">Fela Kuti</a>, Tony Allen, Fania All-Stars, Ray Lema, Bill Laswell, Sly and Robbie, Ladysmith Black Mambazo and many up and coming Cameroonians.</p> <p>In 1984 he joined more than a dozen artists on the fundraising single Tam Tam Pour l\u2019Ethiopie, released indignantly in response to Band Aid, which many Africans considered condescending. Dibango\u2019s 1994 album Wakafrika featured King Sunny Ad\u00e9, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/peter-gabriel\" title=\"\">Peter Gabriel</a>, Salif Ke\u00efta, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/26/arts/music/papa-wemba-congolese-king-of-rumba-rock-is-dead-at-66.html\" title=\"\">Papa Wemba</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/youssou-n-dour\" title=\"\">Youssou N\u2019Dour</a>.</p> <p>Back in 1967 he had been bandleader on Pulsations, the first black music programme on French TV, and in the early 1990s he hosted his own prime-time French TV show, Salut Manu. In 1998 his achievements were celebrated by the rural community where he grew up, with the naming of a cultural centre after him. He reciprocated by donating the saxophone he had used on Soul Makossa.</p> <p>In later years he was an ambassador for Unicef, received several honours from African countries and, in 2010, was made a Chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur. He was still working last year, on tour with Symphonic Safari, blending jazz with classical music.</p> <p>In the UK his frequent concert appearances included a 2008 Africa Day show in Trafalgar Square, but the most satisfying for him were the regular bookings at Ronnie Scott\u2019s club, where he enjoyed being recognised as a \u201cjazz man\u201d.</p> <p>Coco died in 1995. He is survived by his daughters, Georgia and Marva, and son, Michel.</p> <p>\u2022 Manu (Emmanuel N\u2019Djok\u00e9) Dibango, musician, born 12 December 1933; died 24 March 2020</p>",
  "<p>When Vladimir Putin sat down for a briefing on coronavirus, Moscow\u2019s mayor had a tough message for him: the number of infected people is far higher than you\u2019ve been told, he said, and Russia\u2019s healthcare system could be overrun.</p> <p>Breaking with official tallies that show the disease\u2019s conservative growth in Russia, Sergei Sobyanin told Putin on Tuesday that a serious situation was developing as the disease spread in Moscow and in the regions, and that the problem \u201cwould emerge sooner or later\u201d.</p> <p>Sobyanin estimated that the number of people who are ill in the capital may have reached 500, far higher than the 290 that have been identified by Russian doctors.</p> <p>The remarks, apparently backed by municipal data, will confirm doubts about the Kremlin\u2019s claims that it has the coronavirus outbreak under control.</p> <p>\u201cThe growth is high; a serious situation is developing,\u201d Sobyanin told Putin and top aides during the meeting. Many sick people were isolated at home and had not asked for medical care, he said. \u201cThe number who are really sick is far higher [than official estimates].\u201d The remarks were reported on the Kremlin website.</p> <p>Russia has been an international outlier in terms of coronavirus testing, claiming to have identified just 500 cases of the disease despite having carried out more than 165,000 tests. By comparison, just 70,000 people have been tested for coronavirus in the UK, with 6,650 confirmed cases of the disease. Neighbouring Belarus has an infection rate that is three times higher per capita.</p> <p>Critics have questioned whether Russia\u2019s tests were effective at identifying those ill with the virus, and whether cases of coronavirus had not been mischaracterised as pneumonia in an effort to massage the official numbers and prevent panic. Earlier, the business newspaper RBC had reported that numbers of pneumonia patients in Russian hospitals had jumped more than 30% between January 2019 and January 2020, indicating that coronavirus patients may have been misdiagnosed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Sobyanin\u2019s remarks made him the first senior Russian official to publicly contradict the official tally and directly urge greater action from the Russian president in response to the outbreak. He called for prophylactic measures to be taken by the heads of all of Russia\u2019s regions, including the extension of a self-isolation regime for elderly Russians considered most at-risk from the disease.</p> <p>He also saidthat Russia\u2019s healthcare system could be overwhelmed if it was not prepared for a rise in patients, and urged greater testing throughout the country.</p> <p>\u201cNo one in the world knows the real picture,\u201d Sobyanin said.</p> <p>The Kremlin has largely presented the situation with the disease as under control, with top officials including Putin telling the public that the greatest danger was panic. But Tuesday marked a change in the government\u2019s rhetoric, with Putin suddenly donning a yellow protective suit and respirator to tour the capital\u2019s main hospital for coronavirus patients.</p> <p>Earlier on Tuesday, a woman died at the hospital in Kommunarka. Doctors claimed she had not been ill with coronavirus, and had died because of complications from cancer. Russia has tallied only one death linked to the virus.</p>",

But we should not lose sight of the fact that this crisis will pass. Indeed, amid all the negative news, the success in containing the coronavirus in China and other Asian countries is being overlooked. And this is where the coordinated policy response will really matter. Assuming that firms and workers emerge from the crisis relatively unscathed, fiscal and monetary easing should lay the foundation for a swift rebound for the economy.</p> <p> An economic recovery, when it materializes, is not consistent with the pound at its current levels. A number of factors have prompted the pound\u2019s slump. Demand for safe-haven dollars is one, but the UK\u2019s reliance on the \u201ckindness of strangers\u201d is also important given its large current account deficit.</p> <p>In our view, the UK will cope no worse than others in the downturn, nor will it miss out on the rebound.

  "<p>The US could become the new centre of the global coronavirus pandemic, according to the World Health Organization, which said case numbers were rising quickly there even asDonald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/trump-vows-to-open-up-our-country-even-as-deaths-from-coronavirus-rise\">talked of re</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/trump-vows-to-open-up-our-country-even-as-deaths-from-coronavirus-rise\">opening the country for business</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are now seeing a very large acceleration in cases in the US. So it does have that potential [to become the centre of the pandemic],\u201d said Margaret Harris, a WHO spokeswoman.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile in India, Narendra Modi ordered a 21-day lockdown of the whole country, the world\u2019s second most populous, after researchers warned more than 1 million people could be infected by mid-May.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe only way to save ourselves from coronavirus is if we don\u2019t leave our homes; whatever happens, we stay at home,\u201d said the prime minister, who was giving his second address in less than a week to try to rally India\u2019s 1.3 billion people to support the drastic measures.</p> \n<p>\u201cEvery district, every lane, every village will be under lockdown. If you can\u2019t handle these 21 days, this country will go back 21 years,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe only option is social distancing, to remain away from each other. There is no way out to escape from coronavirus besides this.\u201d So far India has reported 482 cases and nine deaths, but there is concern about the potential for the pandemic to spread rapidly.</p> \n<p>Hopes that Italy\u2019s extensive lockdown was bearing fruit, with drops in reported deaths in recent days, proved to be premature. The numbers have risen by 743 to 6,820, the head of the Civil Protection Agency said on Tuesday, ending two days of decline in fatalities. Deaths dropped from 793 on Saturday to 651 on Sunday and just over 600 on Monday.</p> \n<p>Angelo Borrelli, the top coronavirus response official in Italy, had earlier started to sound optimistic.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe measures we took two weeks ago are starting to have an effect,\u201d Borrelli said in an interview with La Repubblica. He said more data over the next few days would help officials understand \u201cif the growth curve is really flattening\u201d.</p> \n<p>But he noted that the real number of infections was probably 10 times higher than the official count. He also said the nation of 60 million was on course to overtake China\u2019s total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in a week.</p> \n<p>In the US, 46,450 people have become infected and there have been 593 deaths, according to the latest <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">data from Johns Hopkins University</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/coronavirus-us-new/map\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Trump acknowledged that crucial healthcare supplies to protect frontline staff treating sick patients were becoming difficult to obtain.</p> \n<p>In an early morning <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1242394374224392192?s=20\">tweet</a>, he said: \u201cThe world market for face masks and ventilators is crazy. We are helping the states to get equipment, but it is not easy.\u201d</p> \n<p>But while more US governors were urging people to stay at home, Trump appeared to play down the crisis on Monday night.</p> \n<p>The president said he was considering ways to restart the economy in the coming weeks and wanted to avoid the pandemic becoming \u201ca long-lasting financial problem\u201d. It would not last as long as three or four months, he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur country was not built to be shut down,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis is not a country that was built for this.\u201d</p> \n<p>Later he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1242455267603877894?s=20\">tweeted</a>: \u201cOur people want to return to work.

  "<p>The UK government published then deleted changes to abortion law that would have allowed women to access medical terminations without travelling to a clinic, leaving women\u2019s health charities \u201cstaggered\u201d.</p> \n<p>In the guidance, which was published for at least five hours on Monday, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said: \u201cThe secretary of state for health and social care has approved two temporary measures in England to limit the transmission of coronavirus (Covid-19) and ensure continued access to early medical abortion services.\u201d</p> \n<p>The changes were to ensure that women could take both pills required for an early medical abortion in their own homes \u2013 without the need to attend a hospital or clinic first, and to allow doctors to prescribe the pills from their own homes. The technical details that accompanied the news showed that the goals were to be achieved by defining both the doctor\u2019s and pregnant woman\u2019s homes as \u201capproved places\u201d for carrying out abortions.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/24/pregnant-healthcare-staff-under-pressure-covid-19\">Pregnant healthcare staff under pressure to work during Covid-19 crisis</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But at 8pm on Monday night, the changes were suddenly deleted from Gov.UK, with the only accompanying explanation stating: \u201cThis was published in error. There will be no changes to abortion regulations.\u201d A DHSC spokesperson repeated the statement, and declined to offer an explanation as to how the error occurred or whether the government no longer felt the changes were necessary to limit the transmission of coronavirus.</p> \n<p>A British Pregnancy Advisory Service spokesperson said the organisation was \u201cstaggered by the reversal\u201d, which came 30 minutes before the televised address in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/boris-johnson-orders-uk-lockdown-to-be-enforced-by-police\">Boris Johnson announced strict new measures</a> to ensure physical distancing across the UK.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe can only assume it is a bureaucratic blunder which will soon be rectified,\u201d they said. \u201cIt simply makes no sense at all that as the prime minister was ordering people to stay in their homes last night, the Department of Health was overturning a decision that would have enabled tens of thousands of women to access early abortion care lawfully at home, protecting their own health, that of their families, and that of the doctors, nurses and midwives who care for them.</p> \n<p>\u201cWomen with heath conditions, those self-isolating or caring for poorly family members simply cannot leave their homes at the moment \u2013 we are being contacted by women in desperate circumstances, incredibly anxious about what they should do.

  "<p>Backed into a corner, Boris Johnson has announced an unprecedented lockdown on Britain\u2019s public life. The solemn tone of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/boris-johnson-orders-uk-lockdown-to-be-enforced-by-police\">last night\u2019s address</a> carried the heavy weight of reluctance. For days, the government\u2019s messaging has been that the public were failing to practice social distancing of their own accord, with sources saying there was \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexwickham/status/1241769736737882114?s=21\">total fury</a>\u201d across Westminster over people flouting orders and Matt Hancock, the health secretary, accusing those still gathering of being \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/23/hancock-socialising-uk-slowing-coronavirus-effort\">very selfish</a>\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/23/hancock-socialising-uk-slowing-coronavirus-effort\">Hancock accuses those still socialising in UK of being 'very selfish'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You don\u2019t have to be too cynical to feel that this language sounds a lot like the government preparing to play its get out of jail card, whereby it offers vague and unenforceable \u201cadvice\u201d, points disapprovingly to those ignoring it, and is then free to shift blame for the inevitable rise in coronavirus cases on to the public.</p> <p>From the beginning, the government\u2019s communications strategy has bordered on lethal complacency. It told the public its plan was \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnharris1969/status/1241632642581303296?s=21\">herd immunity</a>\u201d, which required many to catch the virus, only to backtrack as if it had never said it. Johnson only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/london-pubs-cinemas-and-gyms-may-close-in-covid-19-clampdown\">closed </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/london-pubs-cinemas-and-gyms-may-close-in-covid-19-clampdown\">pubs and restaurants</a> at the weekend, having previously offered social distancing guidance that never cut through. Until Tuesday\u2019s address, ministers have used <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/dont-visit-mum-today-its-the-best-way-to-show-you-love-her-zzt7592ph\">paywalled articles</a> and a 5pm briefing to get information across, rather than the blanket national TV ads and billboards you would expect. It has even emerged that the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/government-ignored-advice-set-up-uk-emergency-alert-system\">can\u2019t send advice on coronavirus</a> directly to Britons\u2019 mobile phones because it repeatedly ignored its own findings that an emergency messaging system could help in times of crisis. Instead, it had to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52017451\">rely on mobile network operators</a>.</p> <p>The result has been all too predictable. People in the UK have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/disaster-waiting-to-happen-visitors-flock-to-skegness\">flocked to seaside towns</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/non-key-workers-tourists-defy-physical-distancing-advice-uk\">beauty spots</a> in recent days as many families appeared to view schools closing as an opportunity for an early Easter holiday. Parks were filled with groups of friends obliviously meeting up in the sunshine. New data confirms the UK has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/uk-lags-behind-other-countries-in-coronavirua-social-distancing-data-shows\">lagging behind other countries</a> in measures such as cutting down our restaurant visits and working at home.</p> <p>The social distancing shambles has led to some uncomfortable \u201cpunching down\u201d, such as high-profile online accounts <a href=\"https://twitter.com/haveigotnews/status/1242098116465131520\">mocking people for queuing at supermarkets</a>. But a focus on blaming the public risks letting the government \u2013 the party with power, resources and reach \u2013 off the hook. There is a middle ground, however. It is possible to think adults have a personal responsibility to consider their high-risk neighbours while believing the government has heavily influenced their failure to do so by poor communication and slow action.</p> <p>The theme of personal responsibility often becomes toxic when used politically \u2013 whether it\u2019s claiming that \u201cthe poor wouldn\u2019t need food banks if only they budgeted properly\u201d, or \u201cthe long-term sick would get off benefits if they had enough motivation\u201d. But you don\u2019t have to be a libertarian to understand that individual behaviour is key in a pandemic, or to believe that we have a duty to think of each other. While political structures strongly determine our choices, free will still means we hold some responsibility for them. </p> <p>To put it another way: leisure venues being open for so long in the UK was a psychological nudge that gave many people \u201cpermission\u201d to still use them \u2013 but it was still up to each of us if we chose a fun outing with mates over listening to calls to protect someone else\u2019s life. An 18-year-old with underlying health problems died this weekend. I wonder how many nights out at the pub they\u2019ll miss out on.</p> <p>Public behaviour in the light of Johnson\u2019s hands-off approach could be compared to smoking, in that smokers were well aware of the risk of cancer but it took legislative action to discourage many of them. But it\u2019s actually more like passive smoking: continuing to socialise in the face of coronavirus, and the state refusing to strongly step in, didn\u2019t just endanger individuals themselves, but other people at higher risk. Perhaps instead of photos of damaged lungs on fag packets, the government should be running ads of grandmas in ICU gasping for air. If this is hard to hear, it should be. People are dying. People are trapped inside their homes afraid. Others have enjoyed a day trip to the beach.</p> <p>For years, Britain\u2019s political culture has stoked a dog-eat-dog individualism, just as it has cast doubt on experts. We should not be shocked that those particular chickens are now coming home to roost. The government is finally introducing the state-led intervention this pandemic requires. But in the coming weeks values, as well as the law, are going to be what helps us get through this. A recognition that we are all more interconnected than appeared to be case. That individual want doesn\u2019t trump community need. That disabled and older people\u2019s lives are worth protecting. Some things should not need legislation.</p> <p>\u2022 Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist and author of Crippled: Austerity and the Demonisation of Disabled People</p>",

  "<p>A man convicted of theft and assaulting the police in a high-profile case nearly 50 years ago has had his conviction quashed at the court of appeal. </p> <p>Constantine \u201cOmar\u201d Boucher, now 71, was one of the Oval Four, a group of young black men who were framed by a corrupt detective and accused of carrying out muggings on the underground in London.</p> <p>Boucher, along with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/13/winston-trew-to-clear-his-name\">Winston Trew</a>, Sterling Christie and George Griffiths, were arrested in March 1972 by a group of undercover police officers at Oval tube station in south London and accused of \u201cnicking handbags\u201d on the underground. They were beaten in the police cells and then charged with attempting to steal, theft and assault of the police.</p> <p>During a five-week trial at the Old Bailey that concluded in November 1972, none of the supposed victims of the thefts appeared and the evidence was based mainly on police claims and contested \u201cconfessions\u201d. All four were convicted and given sentences of up two years in prison or borstal. The sentences were later reduced on appeal but the convictions upheld.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/aug/28/stephen-simmons-arrested-mailbag-theft-1976-hopes-clear-his-name\">DS Derek Ridgewell</a> of the British Transport Police, who led the so-called \u201cmugging squad\u201d and was responsible for a series of other notorious cases in the 1970s, died in prison in 1982 where he was serving a sentence for stealing mail bags.</p> <p>Trew, Christie and Griffiths all had their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/05/oval-four-men-jailed-in-1972-cleared-by-court-of-appeal-in-london\">convictions quashed</a> last December but at that stage it had not been possible to trace Boucher, who had moved to the US.</p> <p>Lord Justice Fulford, sitting with Mrs Justice Carr and Mr Justice Goss, quashed Boucher\u2019s conviction, saying it was \u201cfundamentally undermined by the apparent lack of integrity of DS Ridgewell and the team he led\u201d. He added: \u201cIt is clear that Mr Boucher\u2019s conviction is unsafe. It is highly unfortunate that it has taken nearly 50 years to rectify this injustice.\u201d</p> <p>Trew, whose research into Ridgewell played a major part in the appeals, welcomed the decision. \u201cThe quashing of Omar\u2019s convictions today finally puts an end to the case of the Oval Four,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough I have not seen him since the late 1970s, I expect he will be feeling as happy as I since my convictions were quashed last December by the lord chief justice.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which researched the case and referred it back to the court of appeal, said: \u201cThe commission is very pleased that all of the Oval Four have now had their convictions quashed thanks to our work. These cases may be of some vintage, but what we have found in these and many other older cases we\u2019ve referred over the years, is that wrongful convictions often have complex, serious and lasting effects on their victims.\u201d</p> <p>Boucher\u2019s lawyer, Jenny Wiltshire of Hickman &amp; Rose, said: \u201cWhile it is, of course, happy news that Mr Boucher\u2019s conviction has been quashed, the fact that it has taken nearly so long is very concerning. The British Transport Police and the Home Office have known about this officer\u2019s corruption for decades. Yet they have done little to right his wrongs. DS Ridgewell was first denounced as corrupt in 1973. He was imprisoned in 1980. The BTP could have re-examined his cases then. But they didn\u2019t. In my view, the BTP should now conduct a wholesale review of all this officer\u2019s cases. It seems to me very likely that there may be many other victims of his corruption.\u201d</p> <p>Ridgewell was involved in a series of controversial cases in the early 1970s in which young black men were falsely accused of crimes. His tactics were exposed in the 1973 acquittals of the \u201cTottenham Court Road Two\u201d, two young Jesuits studying at Oxford University. He was moved to a team investigating mailbag theft, where he joined up with career criminals with whom he split the profits of stolen mailbags. He was jailed for seven years and died of a heart attack in prison in 1982 aged 37.</p> <p>It is understood that some of the \u201cStockwell Six\u201d, also arrested by Ridgewell and his team, are having their cases reviewed. This news was welcomed by Trew. \u201cI understand that members of the Stockwell Six have also applied to the CCRC to have their wrongful convictions referred to the court of appeal. This is wonderful news as this is exactly what I called for last year when I urged other victims of Ridgewell\u2019s fit-ups to come forward. This is great news in these troubled times.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Labour\u2019s four-month leadership election to replace Jeremy Corbyn has hampered the party\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic, according to some of its MPs.</p> <p>Critics said the party\u2019s leadership has been sluggish in responding to the crisis and Corbyn, as outgoing leader, has failed to command authority.</p> <p>They said that it had instead fallen to backbenchers and shadow ministers to put pressure on the government, and called for the leadership race to be wrapped up early.</p> <p>Lucy Powell MP, who is leading an inquiry into Labour\u2019s general election loss, said she sympathised with Corbyn, who was facing an unprecedented international crisis as leader of the opposition, but that he could have ended the contest sooner. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/24/labour-leadership-poll-opens-keir-starmer-jobs-rivals\">Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy</a> have been battling for more than 11 weeks to succeed him. Voting is due to end on 2 April.</p> <p>She said: \u201cWe could have easily brought forward the election of the new leader. We are now in the worst of all worlds. Despite their best efforts, Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell feel less relevant.\u201d</p> <p>The Manchester Central MP said the party needed \u201cthat sense of clarity on leadership rather than different messages coming out from different quarters\u201d.</p> <p>She urged the party to act, saying it was not too late to bring forward the election date so the next leader could take over and start attending key government meetings on coronavirus, such as the privy council.</p> <p>Chris Matheson MP, a shadow cabinet minister backing Starmer, said: \u201cThe lesson for the future is seriously that such a protracted contest does nobody any good.\u201d</p> <p>Labour\u2019s national executive committee (NEC) fixed the timetable for the leadership election in January amid criticism that it was deliberately long to help Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, a close ally of Corbyn.</p> <p>The party has said it is reluctant to bring forward the election as it would risk disenfranchising members and supporters who haven\u2019t yet voted.</p> <p>One backbencher said Corbyn should have immediately stepped down and an acting leader would have galvanised key players from the parliamentary Labour party on coronavirus, rather than seeing a piecemeal approach, which has included amendments to the emergency legislation from MPs Harriet Harman and Chris Bryant and shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth, who personally pushed for enforced physical distancing.</p> <p>They said: \u201cFundamentally, it goes back to the fact that Jeremy stayed in post after the general election, which led to a ridiculously long leadership election. A sensible acting leader would never have allowed the NEC to allow it to go on for so long. We would have had a leader standing at the dispatch box with real credibility.\u201d</p> <p>The MP suggested Labour could have had more influence by creating a shadow Cobra, the government\u2019s emergency committee. \u201cOr you could have credibly asked the government to set up a cross-party taskforce using Labour\u2019s expertise on DWP issues.\u201d</p> <p>A Labour party spokesperson said: \u201cJeremy and the shadow cabinet have led a strong and effective response to the coronavirus crisis, offering constructive support to the government where possible and pushing it whenever necessary on key issues such as protection and testing for NHS staff, help for renters, income protection for workers, the self employed and those on insecure contracts, increasing statutory sick pay, and most recently calling for enforcing social protection measures.</p> <p>\u201cIn a number of key areas, the government has followed Labour\u2019s demands for action.\u201d</p> <p>Labour said that Corbyn wrote to the Boris Johnson on 14 March calling for mortgage and rent holidays, both of which the government has since adopted, and an expansion of statutory sick pay.</p> <p>A shadow frontbencher also criticised the core Labour leadership for taking too long to decide whether to support a lockdown.</p> <p>\u201cJeremy has been really cautious,\u201d they said. \u201cPeople are looking for politicians for leadership. They\u2019re not seeing it in government and it\u2019s lacking on our side as well.</p> <p>\u201cThe Labour leadership is just as guilty as Boris Johnson for not taking it seriously as they should. It feels like Jeremy and John were both completely absent until last week.\u201d</p> <p>It is understood that Shami Chakrabarti, the shadow attorney general and former director of civil liberties organisation Liberty, surprised fellow shadow cabinet members when she stepped in to encourage the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, that proportionate legislation could work, if it included a sunset clause.</p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s decision to continue attending the Commons, and carrying out an interview on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, despite the government guidance that people over 70, regardless of any medical conditions, should consider physical distancing has also angered colleagues. \u201cThat was just wrong. He should lead by example,\u201d said the frontbencher.</p> <p>But a Labour source said: \u201cUsing a time of national crisis to get in a last dig at Jeremy is divisive, silly and about as low as you can go. They should be ashamed of themselves.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The \u201ccomplete ban\u201d on evictions promised by the government has been widely criticised after it emerged that the coronavirus bill merely extends the notice required for possession, from two months to three.</p> <p>The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, said last week: \u201cThe government is clear \u2013 no renter who has lost income due to coronavirus will be forced out of their home, nor will any landlord face unmanageable debts.\u201d</p> <p>But the shadow housing secretary, John Healey, said the new coronavirus bill goes back on that vow.</p> <p>He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnHealey_MP/status/1242166208964825090\">tweeted</a>: \u201cWe\u2019ve finally had the government\u2019s amendment to the coronavirus bill spelling out its proposals on evictions, and I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s now clear Boris Johnson has broken his promise to the country\u2019s 20 million renters.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not an evictions ban, as Labour argued for, and renters were eventually promised by Boris Johnson. This legislation does not stop people losing their homes as a result of coronavirus, just gives them some extra time to pack their bags.\u201d</p> <p>The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the claim that it was rowing back on promises was \u201cabsolute nonsense\u201d.</p> <p>A spokesman said: \u201cAs soon as legislation is passed, no new possession proceedings will begin \u2013 in either the social sector or the private rented sector \u2013 for at least the next three months. We have the power to extend this notice period if necessary.\u201d</p> <p>Advice groups called on the government to implement a stronger ban.</p> <p>Dame Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \u201cSimply extending notice periods to three months cannot be seen as \u2018job done\u2019. It means that people dealing with unimaginable financial uncertainty still face the prospect of being served with an eviction notice.</p> <p>\u201cOver the coming days, the government must keep their promise and add to these changes to make sure no one loses the roof over their head as a result of coronavirus.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tenants fear they will be left with huge debts, after they lose their jobs, are chased for arrears on rent, and then forced out of their homes with eviction notices.</p> <p>Caitlin Wilkinson, of Generation Rent, said: \u201cThis legislation fails to deliver on these promises in every respect. All these measures do is extend the notice period for evictions to three months, which will provide little comfort to those faced with losing their homes in the midst of a pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cEqually worrying is the lack of provision made for rent arrears, which will stack up in the three-month period. Many renters will end up with thousands of pounds worth of debt and no means of paying it off. Landlords and tenants are expected to \u2018work together\u2019 to find a solution to suit both parties from June onwards \u2013 but there\u2019s absolutely nothing to stop landlords from evicting tenants if they can\u2019t pay.\u201d</p>",

It has also attempted to reduce funding to help countries in Africa still suffering from the Ebola epidemic, overseen the loss of 61 staff from the CDC\u2019s disease prevention program and proposed deep cuts to the CDC\u2019s environmental health work.</p> <p>Christopher Sellers, an expert in the environment and health at Stony Brook University and a lead author of the report, said the Trump administration\u2019s actions slowed down the response to the virus and probably affected the preparedness of hospitals and various government agencies to the crisis.</p> <p>\u201cThe administration has repeatedly and systematically corroded critical parts of the CDC,\u201d Sellers said. \u201cThis was just begging for an epidemic to hit us. It was a perfect storm of lack of preparation.\u201d</p> <p>Sellers added: \u201cIt\u2019s kind of incredible they are now trying to rewrite history to say we have plenty of resources when they\u2019ve systematically targeted them. They should be held responsible by the American people as it is outrageous.\u201d</p> <p>Donald Trump initially reacted to the onward march of coronavirus by calling it a \u201choax\u201d before then, also inaccurately, claiming that the US had completely contained the disease.</p> <p>The president has since declared a national state of emergency but the federal response has been dogged by a severe lack of testing, a dearth of crucial medical supplies such as ventilators and false and misleading statements by Trump over the need to avoid large gatherings of people.</p> <p>On Sunday, the president was asked in a press conference about the administration\u2019s cuts to the CDC, in particular the removal of an epidemiologist embedded within China\u2019s own CDC equivalent.</p> <p>Trump said: \u201cWe actually gave CDC more money, not less money. They said we defunded. It turned out it was more money. Every one of those things that were said were 100% wrong, and this sounds like another one them.\u201d</p> <p>Trump then sought to blame China for the crisis. \u201cI wish they told us three months sooner that this was a problem,\u201d the president said about a disease that emerged in December and was then reported by China to the World Health Organization in January. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know about it.\u201d</p>",

UK producers Chase &amp; Status concoct a menacing, dubstep-adjacent beat for the prowling Wait Your Turn, while the appropriately named Hard employs industrial-strength bravado (\u201cbrilliant, resilient, fan-mail from 27 million\u201d) to paper over any cracks in her armour. As well as trying out different genres, from the aforementioned dabbles in dubstep to the excellent Fire Bomb\u2019s 80s OTT rock balladry, Rated R also sees Rihanna sparring with more cliched masculine tropes. So the Slash-assisted Rockstar 101 finds her revelling in tortured genius territory, rolling lines like \u201csleep all day, long nights\u201d around in her mouth with renewed relish, while G4L\u2019s bass-heavy hip-hop peacocking features more natural charisma than an entire compilation of male rappers could muster.</p> <p>Still, Rihanna\u2019s personal life bleeds into the morbid atmospherics of mid-tempo lead single Russian Roulette, specifically during the excellent, emotionally charged middle eight: \u201cAs my life flashes before my eyes, I\u2019m wondering will I ever see another sunrise,\u201d she sings with a previously unheard emotional connection. It crops up again on the twisted revenge fantasy of the chugging Fire Bomb. This being a Rihanna album, there are flashes of pure, escapist pop \u2013 the lascivious Rude Boy, the Latin-tinged love story Te Amo \u2013 but the ultimate takeaway is of a pop star who had previously been defined by other people \u2013 be it her early mentor Jay-Z, or more catastrophically, Brown \u2013 making a statement above and beyond the narrative being written for her. </p> <h2><strong>The three albums to check out next</strong></h2> <p><strong>Good Girl Gone Bad (2007)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1mU6h4Xdxc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E1mU6h4Xdxc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Rihanna: Disturbia \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>2007\u2019s Good Girl Gone Bad (and 2008\u2019s equally hit-heavy Reloaded re-release) marked the point Rihanna morphed from radio-slaying popstar to fully blown pop culture-dominating megastar. Across both versions nine singles were released, from the globe-straddling, weather-altering Umbrella to the Ne-Yo co-penned ballad Take a Bow (both US and UK chart-toppers). Aside from the singles, including the Michael Jackson-sampling dancefloor behemoth Don\u2019t Stop the Music, and the gothic-pop of Disturbia, the album constantly flexes its pop muscles, with album track highlights including the futuristic swirl of R&amp;B stomper Breakin\u2019 Dishes, and the stop-start funk of the Timbaland-produced Lemme Get That.</p> <p><strong>Talk That Talk (2011)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg00YEETFzg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tg00YEETFzg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Rihanna: We Found Love ft Calvin Harris \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Following Rated R\u2019s rough-hewn melancholia, 2010\u2019s glossy Loud saw Rihanna return to the dance-orientated pop of old, scoring global smashes with Only Girl (In the World) and the lascivious S&amp;M. On 2011\u2019s Talk That Talk, the dial goes up another notch, be it utilising EDM\u2019s tension and release on the squelchy Where Have You Been and the incomparable, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/calvin-harris\">Calvin Harris</a>-helmed banger We Found Love, or diving headlong into pure filth on the double whammy of Cockiness (Love It) and Birthday Cake (spoiler: she\u2019s not talking about baking).

Gillingham\u2019s highest-paid player gets around \u00a33,000 a week, the lowest \u00a3250 a week.</p> <p>The EFL has agreed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/18/efl-announces-50m-relief-package-for-clubs-in-response-to-coronavirus\" title=\"\">a \u00a350m relief package</a> comprising the remaining TV and sponsorship money due to clubs at the end of the season, and has made available loans of next season\u2019s first payments. Parry has said he is \u201cnot a fan of the begging-bowl culture\u201d but Scally is adamant lower-league clubs require further financial assistance.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the solutions would be if we could approach the Premier League and ask each Premier League club to put \u00a32.5m per club into a solidarity fund for League One and League Two,\u201d Scally said. \u201cThat would give us about \u00a350m and that \u00a350m would probably get those League One and League Two clubs through the next three months, with what they are losing.</p> <p>\u201cWhen your income is between \u00a3150m-\u00a3250m or more, I\u2019m sure \u00a32.5m per club to help the pyramid of football get through this very difficult time is not going to break the bank for most of those clubs, but that is a discussion that Rick Parry I\u2019m sure will be having in conjunction with the head of the Premier League and the FA.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking to go begging with a cap because that\u2019s not what we should be doing \u2013 I agree with Rick on that because we have to look at our own businesses and see how we can realign them \u2013 but even after we\u2019ve realigned our business I\u2019ve got no income.

The Championship has owners that are content to lose collectively \u00a3700m over the last three or four years; that cannot be a sustainable model. If any good comes out of this awful situation, as an industry, maybe it is time we looked at and reflected on our business and said: \u2018We have got to realign our business into something that is normal,\u2019 if \u2018normal\u2019 is the right word, because clearly clubs losing \u00a350m a year is not normal.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s D-day for the industry, a time of reckoning for football. They always say it takes a crisis for people to realise where they are in life and maybe this is the time that football needs to look at itself from top to bottom and realign itself.

But words have meanings, and often real consequences, as we are still seeing in the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d and \u201cwar on terror\u201d.</p> <p>During a war, the liberal democratic order is temporarily suspended, and extraordinary measures are passed that significantly extend state powers and limit the population\u2019s rights. Some of the extended state powers only marginally infringe upon the lives and rights of citizens, such as the creation of a \u201cwar economy\u201d (ie making economic production subservient to wartime efforts), but others have traumatic consequences, such as the mass internment of Japanese Americans during the second world war.</p> <p>Across the world, government leaders have declared (and extended) states of emergency, in countries such as <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/22/europe/spain-coronavirus-sunday-intl/index.html\">Spain</a>, provinces such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQZYLaTJRP0\">Nova Scotia</a>, Canada, and cities such as <a href=\"https://www.wgnsradio.com/murfreesboro-mayor-declares-local-state-of-emergency-for-covid-19--cms-57046\">Murfreesboro</a>, Tennessee.

They also should be strictly related to the crisis at hand and proportional to the threat. At this stage, the threat of contagion is very high, which means that measures to limit the movement of people are legitimized.</p> <p>Similarly, most countries are woefully ill-prepared for the pandemic, with hospitals dangerously overcrowded and underresourced, requiring urgent state intervention. In addition to using massive funds to buy much-needed medical supplies, this could also include enlisting the military to create temporary hospitals, as <a href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-four-sites-identified-army-corps-engineers-initial-list-temporary\">New York</a> is currently doing.</p> <p>But many politicians have gone much further, trying to use the health crisis to push through dubious repressive legislation. For instance, in the United Kingdom, where the Conservative government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-uk-expert-advice-wrong\">response</a> so far has shown almost criminal negligence, Boris Johnson has pushed through a draconian \u201c<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/independentpremium/politics-explained/coronavirus-covid-19-boris-johnson-emergency-powers-bill-parliament-a9409601.html\">coronavirus </a><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/independentpremium/politics-explained/coronavirus-covid-19-boris-johnson-emergency-powers-bill-parliament-a9409601.html\">bill</a>\u201d, which, among others, gives police and immigration officials sweeping powers to arrest people suspected of carrying the coronavirus \u2013 this could make innocent Brits of Chinese descent targets of state repression in a similar way that post-9/11 measures have targeted innocent British Muslims.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/23/how-to-social-distance-tips-convince-friends-family\">An expert guide to physical distancing \u2013 and what to do if friends and family aren't onboard</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Israel, the embattled prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, hoped that the coronavirus could do what three elections have failed to achieve: extend his government rule and keep him out of prison. Linking anti-corona measures to anti-terrorism measures, Netanyahu proposed a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/world/middleeast/israel-convoy-protest-netanyahu.html\">package</a> that critics have called \u201canti-democratic\u201d and has led to public protests in several Israeli cities.</p> <p>Never to be outdone, the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has jumped on the coronavirus to push the final nail in the coffin of the country\u2019s bruised and battered democracy.

In a recent speech, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/22/trump-coronavirus-election-november-2020\">he stated</a>, in his own unique English: \u201cI view it as a, in a sense, a wartime president.\u201d</p> <p>What this \u201cwartime presidency\u201d could look like we could see in the emergency powers the Department of Justice \u201c<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/doj-coronavirus-emergency-powers-140023\">quietly asked</a>\u201d Congress for.

It also includes the request to grant chief judges the power to detain people indefinitely without trial, which critics fear could mean the suspension of habeas corpus (the constitutional right to appear before a judge after arrest and seek release).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>To prevent another Patriot Act, each new 'emergency measure' should be assessed individually on the basis of three clear questions</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are very serious problems with many of the proposed measures, many of them similar to the repressive measures taken after 9/11. First, in many cases the proposals are combinations of repressive measures that are unrelated to this specific crisis. Second, many measures are disproportional to the threat we face \u2013 habeas corpus is at the heart of the rule of law; should we really sacrifice that for a health crisis whose lethality is still largely unknown? Third, while they are all explicitly billed as \u201cemergency measures\u201d, limited to that emergency, the language is often vague and could be used to justify (endless) extensions. We know from experience that temporary measures often become permanent measures.</p> <p>To prevent another <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/30/politics/senate-makes-permanent-nearly-all-provisions-of-patriot-act-with-a.html\">Patriot Act</a>, each new \u201cemergency measure\u201d should be assessed individually on the basis of three clear questions: (1) what is its contribution to the fight against the coronavirus?; (2) what are its negative consequences for liberal democracy?; (3) when will it be abolished? If any of these three questions cannot be adequately answered, the measure should be rejected.</p> <p>While it is important to take the threat of the coronavirus seriously \u2013 really, people, stay at home! \u2013 and to provide the state with the powers it needs to fight the pandemic, we should not let our fear be used to drag us into yet another false \u201cwar\u201d.

  "<p>Asterix illustrator Albert Uderzo has died at the age of 92, his family has announced.</p> <p>The French comic book artist, who created the beloved Asterix comics in 1959 with the writer Ren\u00e9 Goscinny, died on Tuesday. He \u201cdied in his sleep at his home in Neuilly from a heart attack unrelated to the coronavirus. He had been very tired for several weeks,\u201d his son-in-law Bernard de Choisy told AFP.</p> <p>One of the best-loved characters in French popular culture, with more than 370m albums sold worldwide, 11 films and an Asterix theme park, the small-statured Asterix is a warrior from Roman-occupied ancient Gaul, who together with his best friend Obelix and dog Dogmatix \u2013 Id\u00e9fix in the French original \u2013 takes pleasure in outwitting Roman legionnaires.

Gaul is entirely occupied by the Romans. Well, not entirely \u2026 One small village of indomitable Gauls still holds out against the invaders. And life is not easy for the Roman legionaries who garrison the fortified camps of Totorum, Aquarium, Laudanum and Compendium.\u201d</p> <p>Waterstones children\u2019s laureate Cressida Cowell, author and illustrator of the How to Train Your Dragon books, said: \u201cI loved Asterix as a child, and his style was absolutely iconic. Creating a huge cast of individually recognisable characters, and the minute detail of all those group battles and the action scenes is an achievement in itself, but his real skill was combining fast-paced adventure with such humour and warmth. Children come to reading in a lot of different ways, with comics and graphic novels being hugely important for a lot of kids. Asterix has taught generations of children around the world to love reading.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/chris-addison\">Comedian Chris Addison</a> was one of many fans to mourn Uderzo\u2019s passing online. \u201cVery few people\u2019s work will ever give me the amount of pleasure his has ever since I was very young. One of my greatest culinary regrets is that I\u2019ll never get to eat wild boar the way he drew them for Asterix.

With him I learnt about expression more than anyone. Merci ma\u00eetre!\u201d he wrote on Twitter.</p> <p>Writer Oliver Kamm, whose mother, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/18/anthea-bell-obituary\">Anthea Bell</a>, translated the Asterix books into English, said Uderzo was \u201ca cartoonist of genius, whose skills perfectly combined with those of the brilliant Ren\u00e9 Goscinny\u201d. Kamm said he was deeply sad and added: \u201cThough not an English speaker like Goscinny (a keen anglophile), Uderzo had gracious appreciation of the Asterix translations of my mother.\u201d</p> <p>Uderzo met Goscinny in 1951, and the pair began creating characters together, including Oumpah-Pah, seen as a precursor to Asterix. In 1959, they were asked to create a magazine called Pilote, which would feature a \u201ctypically French hero\u201d. They agreed to set their story in ancient Gaul, with the first issue published in October featuring The Adventures of Asterix the Gaul. More than 300,000 copies were sold.</p> <p>Goscinny died in 1977, during an exercise stress test for a medical checkup. Uderzo continued the adventures of Asterix alone. The Great Divide, the 25th Asterix album, was published in 1980 and was the first to be written and drawn by Uderzo alone.

Census data from 2017 suggests there were more than 46,000 vacant units in the city of LA that were not on the market at the time, meaning some owners could be holding them for speculative purposes. That figure is more than the estimated number of homeless people in the city.</p> <p>In response to coronavirus, the state has purchased 1,300 trailers and is looking to lease hotel and motel space to help get the homeless off the streets and into isolation as necessary. In LA, the mayor is setting up thousands of beds in recreation centers. But some advocates and health experts fear the measures won\u2019t be enough and that the homeless population could ultimately <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2020-03-18/coronavirus-homelelss-money-california-risk-150-million\">overwhelm hospitals</a>.</p> <p>While some state lawmakers have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AsmRichardBloom/status/1239600867596091397\">called</a> for all vacant Caltrans properties to be made immediately available, others have said they were <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.com/2020/03/15/as-activists-occupy-caltrans-managed-home-lawmakers-lash-out-at-management-of-houses/\">concerned</a> the houses might not be safe for occupancy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bc7b3459993a2b44b79ce1bb424b8b0038e254c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bc7b3459993a2b44b79ce1bb424b8b0038e254c/0_0_5000_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An LA county health department employee prepares trailers amid the coronavirus pandemic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An LA county health department employee prepares trailers amid the coronavirus pandemic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00c9tienne Laurent/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the concern, then they need to act and make them safe,\u201d said Martha Escudero, 42, who is living in the first house the group reclaimed with her two daughters, ages eight and 10.

State police, however, showed up in vehicles throughout the neighborhood last week and stationed themselves outside other vacant Caltrans homes.</p> <p>Roberto Flores, an El Sereno activist who helped the Reclaimers, said it was emotional to see the empty homes occupied: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to recreate the social fabric that used to be here before \u2026 We\u2019re taking back our lives.\u201d</p> <p>If roughly 200 homes became available to three people each, \u201cThat is 600 human beings protected and treated like human beings,\u201d he added.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ba6a3c2ac02410f4041170c4c006adabed2943ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba6a3c2ac02410f4041170c4c006adabed2943ef/0_110_4800_2883/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martha Escudero, left, plants corn in the backyard of her reclaimed home with her daughters Meztli, right, and Victoria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martha Escudero, left, plants corn in the backyard of her reclaimed home with her daughters Meztli, right, and Victoria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Reclaimer families said they were willing to pay rent at an affordable rate, and that no matter what happens, they don\u2019t plan on leaving, especially during the pandemic.</p> <p>Benito Flores, the Reclaimer, said he knew he could be arrested, but that it was a risk worth taking: \u201cIf I look at the alternatives, it\u2019s illegal to be in a van and that\u2019s unhealthy. It\u2019s illegal to be here. It\u2019s just illegal to be unhoused.\u201d</p> <p>He said he hoped their efforts inspired people across the state to take a similar stand: \u201cThese houses belong to the people and belong to the community and should stay that way.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>O-T Fagbenle is on his knees in a bloodied toga, singing a cappella and begging Jourdan Dunn for one more chance. The supermodel looks wholly nonplussed, so Fagbenle \u2013 playing the eponymous deluded narcissist in the new E4 comedy Maxxx \u2013 sweeps out imperiously, only to creep back to tug the trailing toga fabric free from the door.</p> <p>Comparing Maxxx with Fagbenle\u2019s best-known role in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-handmaids-tale\">The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</a>, where he plays June\u2019s (Elisabeth Moss) husband Luke Bankole, offers a fine illustration of the actor\u2019s versatility: the gentle, measured Luke, risking his life to try to save his wife and child, could hardly be further from the self-absorbed clown that is Maxxx. But Fagbenle has been quietly doing eye-catching work for years on both sides of the Atlantic, notably in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/looking\">Looking</a>, Andrew Haigh\u2019s underseen HBO drama about gay life in San Francisco, and the BBC\u2019s fine Zadie Smith adaptation NW, as well as lead roles in thrillers including Sky One\u2019s The Five and BBC One\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/11/interceptor-review-law-enforcement-drama-spooks-dull\">The Interceptor</a>. You will have seen him in something, just nothing like this.</p> <p>Once one-third of the fictional boyband Boytown (signature hit: Can I See Your ID?), Maxxx is now a bankrupt, pill-popping joke, getting bottled off at nightclub PAs. His desperation to win back Dunn (gamely playing herself) drives him to plot an unlikely professional comeback. What ensues is a wincingly funny portrait of a man prepared to do anything and everything in order to clamber back up to the stars. It is a mordant, unhinged and probably pretty accurate depiction of life on the margins of celebrity.</p> <p>\u201cMaxxx is like the dude who took Beyonc\u00e9 to prom,\u201d says Fagbenle after the scene has wrapped. \u201cHis memory of the relationship is a lot sweeter than reality, and reality for Maxxx yesterday involved him shooting a music video and getting covered in dove shit. I didn\u2019t love [filming] that, but you\u2019ve got to go for it.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7QVo8ahKFA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d7QVo8ahKFA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>You certainly have to when the show is one you are writing, co-directing and headlining. Fagbenle\u2019s brother <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lutiseku/?hl=en\">Luti</a>, whose music videos for Drake, Jay-Z, Beyonc\u00e9 and more have had more than 4.5bn YouTube views, is exec-producing. Their fraternal dynamic feels, aptly enough, like Bros gone right: respectful, self-aware, rooted in genuine talent. Even months later, when Fagbenle arrives at Channel 4\u2019s HQ looking a legitimate star in tailored check suit, suede shoes and fedora, his relaxed demeanour belies a relentless work rate: \u201cI landed at 2am, was up at eight to record the Maxxx theme tune at my brother Rockwell\u2019s studio \u2026 But I have all the problems I\u2019ve asked for.\u201d</p> <p>Maxxx\u2019s problems are more severe. He cuts a tragic, even sympathetic figure because, Fagbenle feels, his aspirations hit close to home. \u201cWe all know people who think \u2018likes\u2019 represent genuine popularity. Those ideas of presentation versus reality, of chasing the one thing you think will give you meaning when it does the opposite, fascinate me.\u201d</p> <p>So should Fagbenle prepare for a backlash from Brosettes, Directioners or the BTS Army? \u201cHand on heart, it\u2019s not based on any particular pop star,\u201d he laughs. \u201cIf anything it\u2019s more my own failings and insecurities, those times where I\u2019ve chased vacuous things or felt depressed because I didn\u2019t feel valued. Ambition can make you do and say crazy stuff. And I\u2019ve got hung up for way too long on a couple of bad break-ups. Basically, I looked at all the ways I\u2019m a fucking idiot and wrote about that.\u201d Fagbenle is no one\u2019s idea of an idiot: engaged, opinionated, casually referencing Walt Whitman, Abraham Maslow and Steven Pinker in his answers. But ambitious? Absolutely.</p> <p>The fourth of 12 children, O-T (short for Olatunde) had to make himself heard.

Although few teenagers \u2013 and even fewer BAME candidates \u2013 were accepted back then, he got into Rada where, sure enough, he was the only black person in his year. It\u2019s a professional experience he has got used to: \u201cEvery time I go on set I play Spot The Black Person.\u201d His first acting job saw him asked to \u201cwhiten up\u201d in order to accentuate the blackness of his on-stage brother against his own mixed-race ethnicity. The reason given? \u201cUp north they might not be able to tell the difference! My first job,\u201d he says in disbelief. \u201cI was panicking about representing a false idea of the truth to fit with someone\u2019s stereotypical understanding. I\u2019ve had a number of experiences like that.\u201d</p> <p>The sort of experience that could have derailed a young actor instead hardened his resolve to make it his way. After building a steady career on screen and stage (his performances in Ma Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom at the National Theatre and Trevor Nunn\u2019s production of Porgy and Bess were particularly acclaimed), he decided to realise a long-held ambition to direct. A few short films followed, but more substantial material proved harder to come by, so instead he wrote something himself, working on Maxxx\u2019s scripts with improv comedians in Toronto while filming The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.</p> <p>On the surface, Maxxx and The Handmaid\u2019s Tale don\u2019t have much in common. Maxxx prods at issues but ultimately plays it for laughs, while comedy is in short supply in the dystopian future where the US has been taken over by a totalitarian patriarchy, and fertile women \u2013 or \u201chandmaids\u201d \u2013 are put into childbearing slavery. But both examine toxic masculinity, albeit from different angles. With Maxxx, which was written just as the #MeToo movement was kicking off, Fagbenle \u201cwanted to see a man out of time, trying to reconcile [his personification of masculinity]\u201d with the expectations of the modern world.</p> <p>In the era of Trump, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale retains an electrifying currency: the donning of scarlet cloak and bonnet among pro-choice campaigners in the US has been adopted by protesters worldwide, while the show\u2019s setting, Gilead, has become shorthand for any patriarchal regime. \u201cWe live in extraordinary times,\u201d says Fagbenle [speaking before the current coronavirus outbreak]. \u201cI\u2019m generally an optimist, although there\u2019s no silver lining to the environmental crisis. But it\u2019s a privilege to be part of something that asks big questions.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c036d84a88bf53fd0a1fee363f0b86cb8fcbc87c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c036d84a88bf53fd0a1fee363f0b86cb8fcbc87c/0_0_3976_2652/1000.jpg\" alt=\"O-T Fagbenle in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gilead tidings: O-T Fagbenle in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophie Giraud/Hulu</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fagbenle feels that the show has largely addressed accusations of gratuitous violence that circulated after a brutal second season. But its repurposing of slave narratives for the predominantly white women of Gilead, and not entirely convincing presentation of a colourblind world, remains troubling for many. \u201cThere\u2019s work to be done,\u201d he admits, \u201cbut there\u2019s been a diversification behind the camera which there wasn\u2019t earlier on, with black writers and black directors. If they continue to challenge themselves to do that, they\u2019ll be over the humps.\u201d</p> <p>Fagbenle also pushed to make Maxxx as diverse as possible on- and off-screen, interviewing widely for cast and crew. \u201cI don\u2019t need to give anyone a leg-up, I just have to make sure they get in the interview room; when you do that, you find talent. If you just say: \u2018We should make sure we get some black people in,\u2019 nothing will happen.\u201d</p> <p>One fascinating exchange on the show sees Maxxx\u2019s strait-laced black manager Tamzin (played by Pippa Bennett Warner) refuting the idea she might be \u201curban\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a really interesting question I wrestle with all the time,\u201d says Fagbenle. \u201cIs black a colour, a culture? Can a white person be urban? I wanted Maxxx to be funny but also explore philosophical things. And to have two love interests who are darker-skinned black women; you don\u2019t see that so often.\u201d</p> <p>It has also allowed Fagbenle to overturn a different sort of expectation, acquired over years in British TV. \u201cI became the professional boyfriend or husband,\u201d he sighs. \u201cLazy thinking. Different opportunities exist in theatre, but there\u2019s still a dearth of big, expansive characters for minorities and for women on screen. I trained classically for the most exciting texts known to man, and then you get the \u2018charming guy in the bar\u2019. Where\u2019s the complexity?

  "<h2><strong>Tell us about your job\u2026</strong></h2> <p><strong>Mike Dougherty (St Paul, Minnesota)</strong>: \u201cI have been a food and beverage vendor since 1989 when I started at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_H._Humphrey_Metrodome\">the Hubert Humphrey Metrodome</a> in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Coincidentally the first day I vended was the same day as my first day of classes at law school. What started out as a job to do as a fun distraction, and a little extra money, from the rigors of law school ended up being a lifelong career in and of itself.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Randi Trent (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)</strong>: \u201cI\u2019m a server at <a href=\"https://www.wellsfargocenterphilly.com/\">the Wells Fargo Center</a>, home of the Philadelphia 76ers. I\u2019ve worked at the stadium for the past 19 years. I love my job. I feed the press box, the cameramen, and work the VIP lounge.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Duane Thwaites (Miami, Florida):</strong> \u201cI\u2019m a father of four. Three boys, one girl. My girl is 11 soon to be 12. My youngest son is 19, he\u2019s away in college. My other children are older and they living in Atlanta. I am \u2026 I guess the reality is I am homeless. I sleep on the floor in a warehouse, downtown Miami, in the Little Haiti area. I\u2019ve worked at Marlins Park at a concession stand for eight years, this will be the beginning of the ninth season.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>How much of your livelihood depends on this job?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Mike Dougherty: </strong>\u201cThere have been years where vending has earned me more than lawyering. Now about a third of my annual income is from vending. Vending has its up and down years depending on attendance and fan enthusiasm for the teams. This year, we were especially looking forward to the baseball season as the Minnesota Twins won their division last year and prospects were high for another good year. From what I have heard through the grapevine, advanced ticket sales are way up.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Randi Trent:</strong> \u201cI work year-round at all three Philadelphia sports stadiums. When the basketball season ends, I start working at the Phillies Stadium, after that, it\u2019s football. My whole income revolves around Philadelphia sports. When a team goes to the playoffs, I make more money. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/11/nba-suspend-season-coronavirus\">Now that the NBA shut down</a>, my income has dropped to zero.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Duane Thwaites:</strong> \u201cI usually work during the home games. I would do 10 hours a day, easily. It\u2019s usually between 10-12 hours a day. Some weeks I don\u2019t work at all, and then there\u2019s some weeks where I do three to four games a week and I do 30-something to 48 hours. The [Miami Open tennis] was a good entry into the season. It usually lasted two weeks, I\u2019ve been doing it since it was at the Hard Rock Stadium, and after it got cancelled this year, everything pretty much went to hell.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>What is your day-to-day life like now?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Mike Dougherty: </strong>\u201cQuiet. We are on semi self-quarantine. We leave the house to run essential errands and walk the dog. With all entertainment venues closed it\u2019s about all we can do. We can\u2019t visit my mother at her assisted living facility, nor do we feel we can even visit friends and other family. We are getting a few chores and projects done around the house. My wife is a night nurse so she does go to work at night as we hope enough precautions are being taken at her hospital to mitigate the risk there.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Randi Trent: </strong>\u201cSince getting laid off, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time on the phone with my coworkers helping them file for unemployment. I\u2019m trying not to stress \u2013 the utility companies are being lenient for now, but I know my bills are going to start piling up. I just came back from a medical leave so I don\u2019t have any more savings. I\u2019m a cancer survivor and I need healthcare. I pay $400 a month for insurance, $975 for rent. I don\u2019t know how long I can pay my bills on unemployment.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Duane Thwaites:</strong> \u201cRight now? A lot of uncertainty. During the offseason, I normally go to my 70-year-old mom\u2019s house to take showers. Now I have to find another alternative to do that. I used to have an alternative where I had a gym membership and went to the gym to work out, but now all the gyms are closed, and so I\u2019m caught in a really hard place for something as simple as taking a shower. Plus, the uncertainty really has me because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next. There\u2019s no money. AT&amp;T still want their money for this phone, my car insurance still needs to be paid, and there\u2019s no money coming in, there\u2019s no work. Everything is still up in the air. People are saying we gonna get money, but nobody\u2019s explaining how or when.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Have you received help from teams or owners?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Mike Dougherty:</strong> \u201cI have not received any word about the teams, employers, or athletes reaching out to help. I am kind of encouraged by words that some teams are stepping up, Mark Cuban [of the Dallas Mavericks] and Glen Taylor of the Minnesota Timberwolves are individual owners I have heard <a href=\"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2880835-mark-cuban-mavs-announce-hourly-arena-workers-will-be-paid-during-nba-hiatus\">say they are going to do something</a>. But as for the teams I work with, the Twins, the Wild, and the Vikings, I have not heard anything about offers of assistance.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Randi Trent:</strong> \u201cNo. I was on the shuttle back to the employee parking lot when I heard the news from a coworker that the NBA suspended the season. The next day I learned that the Wells Fargo Center was closed until further notice. We\u2019re waiting to hear what will happen next.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Duane Thwaites:</strong> \u201cWe were informed via email. I believe it was last Thursday, saying it was official. We were actually in the process of training for the upcoming season. The [baseball] season was supposed to start on the 26<sup>th </sup>[of March] We just started basic training, alcohol, food, customer service training, and they only did two days, which was Monday and Tuesday. Wednesday got canceled and Thursday morning we got an email saying everything was canceled indefinitely. Nobody called or spoke to us directly.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>What other job prospects do you have?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Mike Dougherty:</strong> \u201cAs far as vending goes there are none. We can only wait until the crises ends. I do believe that when the games do start again, it will be a much-needed sign of a return to normalcy. Personally, I also am not sure if the agencies I work through for my day job will be manning any projects during this, and I don\u2019t know if I will be able to find any ancillary legal work I do, such as writing wills and reviewing contracts at a time when people may have more on their minds. But as my wife is in an essential health job she will be working so I take some solace that we will make it through. My bigger concern is with my fellow vendors and stadium workers, many of whom are more dependent on this work than I am.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Randi Trent:</strong> \u201cWhere am I going to get a job? I\u2019ve been a server my whole career. No restaurants are open, let alone hiring anyone. I know that everyone is suffering right now and there\u2019s nothing my employer can do about the pandemic. But it\u2019s hard to be left in the lurch with no income. I know some teams have stepped up to the plate to pay their stadium workers and it would mean a lot to see that happen in Philadelphia.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Duane Thwaites: </strong>\u201cIt\u2019s the reality for many of us that work these types of jobs, especially with the kind of work I\u2019m doing. I have background issues, it\u2019s not easy for me to get a job, so I really don\u2019t know what\u2019s left for me. I know some of my coworkers are just hoping that other part-time jobs will call them back to work, but for me there isn\u2019t too many at this moment.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Editor\u2019s note: since the subjects of this article were interviewed, it was announced that some, but not all, workers at the Wells Fargo Center <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/business/comcast/coronavirus-philadelphia-jobs-comcast-wells-fargo-center-aramark-unite-here-20200313.html\">will be paid for games postponed during March</a>.

  "<p>From midnight on Sunday 15 March, everyone entering Australia from overseas, except for flight attendants and residents of the Pacific Islands, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/all-overseas-arrivals-in-australia-must-self-isolate-for-14-days-amid-new-coronavirus-rules\">is required to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival</a>. Failing to do so risks thousands in fines.</p> <p>Tasmania, South Australia, the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Queensland have also imposed mandatory self-isolation requirements on non-essential travellers from interstate \u2013 including residents returning home.</p> <p>But what does self-isolation actually mean, and can you still Uber home from the airport? We answered your burning questions.</p> <h2><strong>Can I get a taxi, Uber or public transport home from the airport?</strong></h2> <p>The prime minister, Scott Morrison, indicated that people subject to self-isolation would still be able to take taxis and public transport from airports.</p> <p>People who need to travel domestically after arriving in Australia will be able to continue their journey, beginning self-isolation when they arrive at their destination, according to Victoria\u2019s chief health officer, Brett Sutton.</p> <p>However, in Western Australia, people will be asked to undertake their self-isolation at the point of entry, so at Eucla or Kununurra if they are arriving by road.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/mar/23/how-many-cases-of-coronavirus-are-there-in-australia-live-statistics\">How many cases of coronavirus are there in Australia? Live statistics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s important to maintain hygiene measures while in transit. Use hand sanitiser and cough into your elbow or into a tissue, and maintain a 1.5-metre distance from other passengers where possible. If you are a recently returned traveller in New South Wales, <a href=\"https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/factsheets/Pages/hubei-contacts-and-travellers.aspx\">you must</a> wear a surgical mask while travelling to your home or hotel.</p> <p>The safest way to get home from the airport is for someone you live with to pick you up. If you have to take an Uber or a taxi, it\u2019s worth sitting in the back seat and keeping a note of the vehicle number or the driver.</p> <h2><strong>Why doesn\u2019t the ban include Pacific Islanders?</strong></h2> <p>Travellers from the Pacific Islands who are transiting through Australia are currently<strong> </strong>exempt from the 14-day self-isolation requirement in both Australia and New Zealand.</p> <p>This exemption is <a href=\"https://www.premier.vic.gov.au/state-of-emergency-declared-in-victoria-over-covid-19/\">explicitly mentioned in the Victorian state of emergency declaration.</a></p> <p>That is because many Pacific Island nations are only accessible via Australia and New Zealand. There have also been very few cases of Covid-19 in the Pacific.</p> <h2><strong>I don\u2019t live alone. Does my family have to self-isolate as well? Can I share a bed with my partner?</strong></h2> <p>This depends. If you have been diagnosed with Covid-19, anyone you live with will be classed as a close contact, so all of you will need to self-isolate.</p> <p>If you are self-isolating as a precaution, for example because you have just returned from overseas, they do not need to self-isolate \u2013 but you should stay as far away from them as possible. Use a separate bedroom and bathroom if possible. Ensure everyone in the home washes their hands frequently, and surfaces and doorknobs are frequently wiped with an alcohol-based disinfectant. Try to stay at least 1.5 metres away from the other people in your home. You cannot have visitors.</p> <p>Police in NSW have been empowered to issue $1,000 on-the-spot fines for people breaching self-isolation rules. In Victoria, a squad of 500 police officers is checking on people at home. In all states, police are monitoring those supposed to be under self-isolation.</p> <h2><strong>Can I look after children, elderly parents or vulnerable people?</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s recommended you <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/how-to-protect-australias-most-vulnerable-people-from-coronavirus\">stay away from people who are particularly vulnerable to the virus</a>, including elderly relatives, and minimise contact with other people, including children. If you are experiencing symptoms, wear a mask or a makeshift mask.</p> <p>Moy said people needing to look after children or parents while in self-isolation should maintain good hygiene practices and minimise contact. Try to keep a 1.5-metre distance when possible, wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, and disinfect surfaces.</p> <p>\u201cTo expect hard and fast rules is difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re asking for patience, commonsense and probably a level of ingenuity from the public to get us through this.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Can I go for a walk?</strong></h2> <p>Each state and territory has slightly different laws around self-isolating, but if you are under a mandatory order to self-isolate it\u2019s best to avoid going outside for anything but medical appointments and emergencies. Wear a mask when outside.</p> <p>The Australian government\u2019s health advice recommends exercise DVDs or walking around your backyard.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/can-a-face-mask-protect-me-from-coronavirus-covid-19-myths-busted\">Can a face mask protect me from coronavirus? Covid-19 myths busted</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases expert from Australian National University, said the thing to keep in mind was proximity to other people \u2013 which means a walk alone, at a quiet time of day, should be fine. But the deputy chief health officer, Paul Kelly, said people on self-isolation for quarantine reasons should not leave their property at all, which is also implied in the <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert/what-you-need-to-know-about-coronavirus-covid-19#selfisolation-selfquarantine\">federal government guidelines</a>.</p> <p>The situation may be different if you are under a legislative order, in which case you will have to abide by the rules set down in each state.</p> <h2><strong>I have been self-isolating as a precaution and now I feel sick. What should I do?</strong></h2> <p>If you are self-isolating because you have returned from overseas or interstate, or have had contact with a known case, and you begin to notice respiratory symptoms (particularly fever, shortness of breath or a cough), contact your state or territory health department, your GP or the emergency clinic of your local hospital. Call before attending your GP or hospital to warn them you may have the virus.</p> <p>If you have severe shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, call triple zero.</p> <p>You will not be able to get a test unless you fit certain high-risk criteria and have respiratory symptoms. The Australian government is not testing asymptomatic people. Kelly indicated on 23 March that the testing criteria might be changed because the number of international travellers had dropped significantly due to travel restrictions. Those new criteria have not been released. Only a finite number of tests is available.<strong> </strong>If you have symptoms of pneumonia you will be tested regardless of travel or contact history.</p> <h2><strong>What if I run out of food?</strong></h2> <p>Ask a neighbour, family member or friend to deliver groceries to you. These should be left outside your door. The same goes for grocery deliveries and takeaway food.</p> <p>In Victoria, care packages will be delivered to vulnerable people who do not have friends or family to help out. Those care packages can be requested by calling the health department.<strong> </strong></p> <p>Some community groups are also organising to provide food and supplies to people in isolation. If you have a neighbourhood Facebook group, check with them.</p> <h2><strong>What\u2019s the difference between self-isolation and social distancing?</strong></h2> <p>If you are self-isolating you cannot go outside (except to the backyard) for any reason, other than emergencies or for medical appointments.</p> <p>Self-isolation is a requirement for people who have potentially been exposed, are entering Australia or moving between certain states or territories within Australia. It\u2019s mandatory for 14 days from point of contact or point of entry, and if you become unwell in that time you need to notify health authorities to get a test for Covid-19.</p> <p>If you are diagnosed with Covid-19, you are effectively under continual self-isolation until your doctors say otherwise.</p> <p>Social distancing is a preventive measure. If you are socially distancing, you can still leave the house, go to the supermarket, or go for a run, but you should not socialise. If you cannot work from home, you can still go to work. If schools are open in your state your children can go to school, although<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/victoria-nsw-lockdowns-scott-morrison-coronavirus-national-cabinet\"> the recommendation from some premiers is that you keep them home anyway.</a></p> <p>Social distancing means you limit your movement to essential activities. It\u2019s recommended you do not visit people who may be particularly vulnerable to the virus, such as elderly people.</p> <p>Bans on attending a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/australia-coronavirus-shutdown-what-is-open-closed-places-scott-morrison\">cinema, casino, restaurant, cafe, gym, pub, place or worship</a> came into force on 23 March. From midnight 25 March, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/australia-coronavirus-stage-2-shutdown-not-lockdown-which-places-closed-what-open\">beauty salons, galleries, libraries, museums, amusement parks, auctions, and open house inspections are closed</a>. Weddings have been restricted to five people, funerals to 10 mourners, and outdoor exercise like boot camps are also restricted to 10 people. </p> <p>The official health advice from the Australian government defines social distancing as remaining 1.5m from other people at all times, but the prime minister and all premiers and chief ministers have urged everyone who can to stay at home. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/23/no-getting-on-the-beers-at-home-with-mates-as-coronavirus-clampdown-increases-video\">Victorian premier Daniel Andrews said people should not be socialising</a> in their homes.</p> <p>Authorities have cracked down on people going to the beach, or gathering in public places. There are bans on outdoor gatherings of more than 500 people and indoor gatherings of more than 100, or where there is not at least 4 sq m of space per person. If you breach those mass gathering rules, you face a fine. NSW has introduced $1,000 on the spot fines for breaching social distancing rules, and a squad of 500 police is enforcing these rules in Victoria. </p> <h2><strong>What happens if I don\u2019t self-isolate? </strong></h2> <p>Self-isolation for 14 days is mandatory for any one who arrived in Australia after 12.01am on 16 March, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/how-australia-will-enforce-coronavirus-self-isolation-rules-for-overseas-arrivals\">financial penalties apply.</a></p> <p>Those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/how-australia-will-enforce-coronavirus-self-isolation-rules-for-overseas-arrivals\">penalties also apply to anyone who ignores state-specific self-isolation requirements</a>, and to people who have been ordered to self-isolate because they have potentially been exposed to the virus. If you are required to self-isolate you will be told by Border Force authorities at the airport, state police at a domestic border, or the health department.</p> <h2>More information</h2> <p>National coronavirus hotline \u2013 <strong>1800 020 080</strong></p> <p>NSW \u2013 <strong>1300 066 055</strong></p> <p>Victoria \u2013 <strong>1800 675 398</strong></p> <p>Queensland \u2013 <strong>13 HEALTH or 13 432 584</strong></p> <p>South Australia \u2013 <strong>1300 232 272</strong></p> <p>Western Australia \u2013<strong> 1300 62 32 92</strong></p> <p>Tasmania \u2013<strong> 1800 671 738</strong></p> <p>ACT \u2013 Business hours: <strong>02 5124 9213</strong>, after hours: <strong>02 9962 4155</strong></p> <p>Northern Territory \u2013 <strong>08 8922 8044</strong></p>",
  "<p>Last Tuesday, Jessica Altchiler led a ballet class. But instead of the long, sleek barre she would normally rely on for support, she grasped on to a TV stand. And if that alone didn\u2019t prove she wasn\u2019t at a conventional dance studio, the red-and-black plaid pet bed in the background gave her away.</p> <p>Still, she tendued, relev\u00e9d and coached other dancers, even though she couldn\u2019t see them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/23/rosie-o-donnell-broadway-livestream\">Broadway in a garage: the clumsy pleasures of Rosie O'Donnell's star-studded livestream</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m already sweating!\u201d she said as she ducked into the camera frame. \u201cI hope other people are sweating, too.\u201d</p> <p>Not even a week before she was teaching on Instagram Live, Altchiler had been in Detroit as part of her first professional job in the national tour of Fiddler on the Roof. While she and her fellow cast members performed in the show, they saw headlines about Broadway shutting down and March Madness being cancelled. Then, their own tour dates were postponed, and a suddenly unemployed Altchiler boarded a nearly empty flight back to her family home in Connecticut.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s strange for me to think about people still having a job because, for me, the world was just turned upside down,\u201d she said.</p> <p>All of the savings that she and her co-workers had been carefully growing to move to New York, pay for an apartment or invest in classes now have to be redirected toward survival during this unprecedented time in theater history, and some of her colleagues are scrambling to find a place to stay after months on the road.</p> <p>As the world wrestles with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19</a>, Altchiler\u2019s new reality isn\u2019t particularly uncommon among artists. Theater professionals are frightened, and they\u2019re mourning a lot of art that may never again see the light of day as venues shutter at least temporarily and would-be audiences disappear. But even as performers suffer great personal and professional losses, they\u2019re working overtime to send messages of hope and peace, provide necessary resources to others who are struggling and offer a balm for the social-distanced and self-isolated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aac11d82f6491e73ea7255754c0fbc600f43605c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aac11d82f6491e73ea7255754c0fbc600f43605c/0_0_3866_2578/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A note outside the theater for the hit play Hamilton explains why they have closed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A note outside the theater for the hit play Hamilton explains why they have closed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On an at-home edition of The Tonight Show last Wednesday, Lin-Manuel Miranda joined Jimmy Fallon to raise money for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights Aids\u2019 Covid-19 <a href=\"https://donate.broadwaycares.org/campaign/covid-19-emergency-assistance-fund/c276873\">emergency assistance fund</a>. The Hamilton star performed his song about parents wanting to give the best possible version of the world to their children, as parents everywhere, including Fallon and Miranda, stare down a global crisis alongside their own kids.</p> <p>Also online, the theater legend and radio host Seth Rudetsky and James Wesley, his producer husband, quickly organized <a href=\"https://actorsfund.org/about-us/news/stars-house\">twice-daily at-home performances</a> to fundraise for the Actors Fund. A long list of Broadway A-listers immediately signed up. Kristin Chenoweth was all dressed up when she appeared on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrCvJ4LXzeI\">the web series</a> from her bathroom over the weekend, and on Saturday, Lea Salonga will call in to sing at 2am Manila time.</p> <p>\u201cArtists love the world, and they love helping,\u201d Rudetsky said. \u201cSo every single person we wrote basically just wrote back right away and said: \u2018I\u2019m in, I\u2019m in, what do I do?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, theaters are trying to figure out how to stay afloat and take care of their own as the very notion of live entertainment has become taboo. Susi Damilano, co-founder and producing director of the San Francisco Playhouse, said she hasn\u2019t had to fire anyone, and she\u2019s asking hourly workers to submit their schedules on a week-to-week basis for compensation. She\u2019s hoping patrons will donate the value of a ticket and landlords will ease up on rent; if not, her playhouse will only be able to pay people for a few months.</p> <p>\u201cI think that the arts and culture are proving to be where we all turn in times of difficulty, and yet are the first and hardest hit economically,\u201d said Damilano. \u201cAnd people are realizing that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"24a826f2e82a0ea6aadc588a970ee0c587fb6f88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24a826f2e82a0ea6aadc588a970ee0c587fb6f88/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As theaters take a financial clobbering, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/theater/lynn-nottage-annie-baker-coronavirus.html\">some</a> are requesting that playwrights refund advance payments. Lynn Nottage \u2013 one of America\u2019s foremost playwrights who has earned two Pulitzer prizes for her work \u2013 was asked by a large regional theater to return her advance, even as everything she had scheduled was cancelled before her eyes and she lost what would have probably been the majority of her income for the year.</p> <p>Nottage said most companies aren\u2019t making such requests, but she did worry about what\u2019s going to happen as theaters \u2013 another place where people go to heal \u2013 close down for the time being. She empathized with the young artists who had debuts in Seattle, New York and Chicago, the up-and-coming actors, playwrights and directors who usually present work during this time of year and even the singers who were performing in her first opera <a href=\"https://www.lct.org/shows/intimate-apparel/\">at Lincoln Center</a>.</p> <p>On Broadway, young performers who were ready for their big breaks got caught in limbo, some even before their first performances. Michael Lepore, who is making his Broadway debut alongside 12 others in Sing Street, had just walked on the Lyceum Theatre stage for the first time when all of Broadway closed at least until April.</p> <p>\u201cIt was all these dreams come true, with this thing hanging in the air of like, \u2018Oh God, this is going to be it for a little bit,\u2019\u201d he said.</p> <p>With everything delayed, he retreated to his parents\u2019 home in Connecticut with all his instruments \u2013 as a cover, he\u2019s required to know the show on acoustic and electric guitar, bass, piano, synthesizer, baritone electric guitar and stylophone. He\u2019s been getting his notes in order and making sure he\u2019s off-book. But he\u2019s also started working on his own music, and he\u2019s recording a few things.</p> <p>People are adapting, Rudetsky said. Quoting the musical Closer Than Ever, he started to sing: \u201c\u2018If someone told me even just a week ago \u2026 I would have said you\u2019re crazy, I\u2019d have burst right into tears, but here I am.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cYes, the things we plan on happening are not gonna happen,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, who knows what <em>will</em> happen?\u201d</p>",

Anyone entering the state after that time, from overseas or another state of Australia, is required to undergo a mandatory 14-day self-isolation. The WA police commissioner has stated that this self-isolation will be required to occur at the point of entry. So if you drive in, you\u2019re stuck at Eucla or Kununurra for two weeks.</p> <p>The WA government is looking to acquire hotels to enforce self-isolation, and has also suggested repurposing Rottnest Island \u2013 a former Aboriginal prison turned holiday destination \u2013 for quarantine purposes.</p> <p>The new border provisions will be enforced by WA police, who are also enforcing rules around mass gatherings and social distancing, using powers under the <a href=\"https://www.legislation.wa.gov.au/legislation/statutes.nsf/main_mrtitle_294_homepage.html\">Emergency Management Act</a>. That act was empowered by a state of emergency declaration on 15 March. </p> <p>Under the act, travellers who breach the 14-day self-isolation order are liable for a $50,000 fine or possible jail time.

If there is an outbreak in those border communities, those exemptions will be lifted.</p> <p>Police have converted heavy vehicle weigh stations to border check points.</p> <p>SA<strong> </strong>declared a public health emergency on 15 March . Premier Steven Marshall told AAP the declaration would allow public health officers to take \u201call the necessary actions required to keep the people of South Australia as safe as we possibly can\u201d.</p> <p>The SA parliament this month passed new laws giving public health officers greater powers to order a person to self-isolate, be detained in a particular place or agree to medical testing.</p> <p>Failure to comply with orders under the revised <a href=\"https://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/LZ/C/A/SOUTH%20AUSTRALIAN%20PUBLIC%20HEALTH%20ACT%202011/CURRENT/2011.21.AUTH.PDF\">Public Health Act 2011</a> carries a maximum fine of $25,000.</p> <h2>Tasmania</h2> <p>On 19 March Tasmania announced state-specific quarantine measures, requiring everyone arriving in Tasmania or on Flinders or King Islands \u2013 whether they be a Tasmanian resident returning home, a domestic Australian traveller, or an international arrival \u2013 to undertake a mandatory 14-day quarantine period.</p> <p>The only exception is essential services, like health workers. Arrivals to Tasmania will be asked to fill in a new state-specific arrivals card, and will be told if they qualify as performing an essential service. From 23 March, travel on the Spirit of Tasmania was limited to residents and essential services.</p> <p>The new penalty for breaching this quarantine, under a state of emergency that was also declared on 19 March, is a fine of $16,800 or six months jail.</p> <p>Earlier, Tasmania followed other states in making an order to ban non-essential mass gatherings. That ban does not include markets, like Hobart\u2019s Salamanca market, on the justification that those events involve people moving through and are therefore unlikely to result in someone having sustained close contact with a stranger. However school fetes and assemblies have been banned.</p>",
  "<p>The huge financial cost of the coronavirus outbreak is being felt in the major football codes as Australian sport braces itself to feel the full impact of the pandemic. </p> <p>With the cancellation of the A-League on Tuesday, all professional sport in Australia is now on hold, with all top-level competitions either suspended or cancelled. </p> <p>The AFL on Sunday called a halt to its men\u2019s competition while the AFLW was cancelled outright. The NRL followed suit on Monday before Football Federation Australia made its own call on Tuesday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/24/a-league-postponed-as-australian-sport-grinds-to-a-halt-due-to-covid-19\">A-League postponed as Australian sport grinds to a halt due to Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The cancellations have raised doubts over the financial security of the organisations, with ARLC chief Peter V\u2019landys labelling the NRL\u2019s situation \u201ccatastrophic\u201d and AFL CEO Gillon McLaclan calling it the game\u2019s \u201cbiggest financial crisis in our history\u201d.</p> <p>AFL players have offered to take a 50% pay cut while clubs are out of action, with the competition on hold until at least 31 May. However, it is believed the AFL is not satisfied with that figure, with News Corp reporting the league will push for a 75% cut in the coming months.</p> <p>The AFL and its 18 clubs have had to slash staff numbers by roughly 80% in a brutal phase of job cuts while the NRL closed its offices from Tuesday until at least 1 May, forcing hundreds of staff across all departments to take annual leave. </p> <p>AFL executives, including chief executive Gillon McLachlan, are taking a minimum 20% pay cut. All remaining staff at the AFL will have reduced hours during the season\u2019s suspension, while casual workers have been let go.</p> <p>Almost half of the A-League\u2019s contracted players are facing life without a job from June. More than 120 players come off contract on 31 May with little or no fallback option due to the impact on football competitions in Australia and across the globe.</p> <p>The A-League is postponed until at least 22 April, though chances of a resumption before the contracts expire is unlikely given the estimations it could take months before the pandemic is under control.</p> <p>Collingwood president Eddie McGuire urged AFL decision makers not to \u201cscrew the players\u201d amid ongoing pay negotiations.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not a union dispute,\u201d McGuire said on Triple M on Tuesday. \u201cThis is not people trying to get into it and claim a scalp ... the situation is that the players have received money for this half of the year, because that was fair enough, everyone\u2019s getting paid.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the next part of the journey that we have to get through until we actually start playing games again and we can get some money coming in. The Channel 7 money, the Foxtel money stopped this week. It\u2019s finished, it\u2019s all over.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no gate receipts, the AFL is cutting through its costs, all the clubs are cutting through their costs, and we have to come to an elegant situation here ... if there\u2019s no money, there\u2019s no money.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to not screw the players at the same time. They are the centrepiece of our game, they\u2019re wonderful people, they\u2019re great young men, and we have to do the right thing.\u201d</p> <p>Players would likely have to take even bigger wage cuts if the remainder of the 2020 season was abandoned altogether, which remains a distinct possibility in uncertain times. </p> <p>NRL clubs have been informed they would receive their scheduled $1.2m monthly payment from league HQ next week. The payments are also expected to be made in May and June, however it is unclear whether the league can continue cashflow from July onwards.</p> <p>It is understood the game has around $150m in reserves. Just last week, it was revealed the game could lose roughly $500m should the entire season be cancelled. That includes $13m in lost broadcast revenue for every round missed, meaning a total loss of $104m should the game be postponed until June.</p> <p>League officials will next meet with Rugby League Players Association to discuss the shutdown\u2019s impact on player salaries.</p>",
  "<p>Standing in the Brady briefing room at the White House last week, Donald Trump said that despite new restrictions on the number of journalists allowed in the room, there were still too many reporters around.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re actually sitting too close,\u201d the president told the journalists. \u201cWe should probably get rid of about another 75, 80% of you. I have just two or three that I like in this room.\u201d</p> <p>If it was a joke, the timing was terrible.</p> <p>As the coronavirus crisis has grown, so too has the power of the president\u2019s whim to shape American life, whether that means choosing which states get emergency medical equipment first, deciding where to deploy troops to build temporary hospitals \u2013 or controlling what the public knows about what the government is doing.</p> <p>In recent weeks, Trump has invoked emergency powers enabling him to waive certain healthcare regulations and direct enormous streams of cash to areas of need. He has also announced that the federal government would use its authority to direct private companies to boost the production of surgical masks, gloves and other equipment, although the status of those efforts was unclear.</p> <p>For now the risk \u2013 the seeming surety \u2013 of a national disaster has fostered a willingness in even Trump\u2019s harshest critics for him to aggressively seize the reins of his office and marshal the power of the federal government toward a muscular and decisive response that could save thousands of lives.</p> <p>But with this widespread desire for action has come related concerns about where, exactly, that power will stop growing, when the emergency crests, and how that power will shrink when the crisis subsides.</p> <p>Civil society advocates warn the fog of crisis could give Trump cover to grab adjacent powers, not related to the current emergency, that might be difficult to claw back \u2013 especially if Congress and the courts failed to check Trump after the fact.</p> <p>\u201cOrdinarily, that\u2019s not something you\u2019d be worried about, because it would seem kind of unthinkable for a president to exploit a pandemic to arrogate a bunch of power that he doesn\u2019t need,\u201d said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the liberty and national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice.</p> <p>\u201cBut we have seen that this president is willing to abuse emergency powers, and to use them for political gains. And so we have to worry.\u201d</p> <p>By <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-declaring-national-emergency-concerning-novel-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-outbreak/\">invoking</a> the National Emergencies Act on 13 March, Trump gained access to emergency powers in more than 100 other statutes, Goitein said, \u201cand if you look at those authorities, very few of them relate to health crises\u201d. With incremental action, Trump could expand government control of the internet, freeze private assets or change the size and composition of the armed forces.</p> <p>Other steps Trump has taken in the coronavirus response, such as restricting international borders and imposing mandatory quarantines for certain travelers, do not rely on emergency authorities but could create a legacy of expanded executive power that advocates fear could outlast the virus.</p> <p>One step Trump did not take after his administration <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/01/31/secretary-azar-declares-public-health-emergency-us-2019-novel-coronavirus.html\">declared</a> a public health emergency on 31 January was to reallocate funds to speed approval for drugs and ramp up the production of coronavirus tests kits. Trump\u2019s failure to deploy that power, the University of Texas law professor Steve Vladeck said, may have ironically created a scenario in which he ends up using much broader powers.</p> <p>\u201cThe president\u2019s dilatory use of the powers he has, I think, is going to end up requiring him to use a lot more of that power, in ways that are a lot more controversial and a lot more coercive and a lot more inconsistent,\u201d Vladeck told Benjamin Wittes of the Brookings Institution in a <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/lawfare-podcast-bonus-edition-steve-vladeck-emergency-powers-and-coronavirus\">Lawfare podcast</a> about emergency powers and coronavirus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"38f39f4948cbc823d5c64fdcf4a908efd2ec8951\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38f39f4948cbc823d5c64fdcf4a908efd2ec8951/0_169_5098_3060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Members of the Maryland national guard control entry to a section of parking lot on the south side of FedEx Field on Monday that officials said will become a clinic for coronavirus health screenings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Members of the Maryland national guard control entry to a section of parking lot on the south side of FedEx Field on Monday that officials said will become a clinic for coronavirus health screenings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Concerns that the administration would look for ways to use the crisis to move the lines of the law were sharpened by <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/doj-coronavirus-emergency-powers-140023\">reports</a> last week that the justice department had asked Congress to pass legislation allowing federal judges to detain people indefinitely without trial during emergencies.</p> <p>But analysts differ in their imaginations of how a dangerous expansion of power by Trump might unfold, with the economy in a tailspin and a presidential election on the horizon.</p> <p>Under extraordinary powers accessible to Trump after his national emergency declaration, he could declare the coronavirus to be a \u201cforeign threat\u201d and impose financial sanctions on anyone he said was contributing to the threat, such as a media company or a political opponent.</p> <p>He could announce an interstate travel ban, enforceable by the military, citing a need to stop the spread of the virus. Along similar lines, he could take steps that could make it harder for some people to vote in the presidential election in November \u2013 or make it more difficult for legal challenges to such steps to be heard in court.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not hard to imagine the federal courts in general, and this supreme court in particular, being remarkably deferential to the federal government in a public health crisis like this one,\u201d Vladeck told Wittes.</p> <p>Or, in what analysts describe as a worst-case scenario, the justice department could move for a federal judge to declare a breakdown of local law enforcement \u2013 at which point Trump could theoretically deploy the military in the streets, in a manner breaking with <a href=\"https://www.army.mil/article/45029/the_army_response_to_hurricane_katrina\">past deployments</a> of active-duty troops for disaster response.</p> <p>As an ominous reference point, civil liberties advocates point to anti-democratic moves taken by the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to close most courts, adjourn parliament and exploit secret cellphone data.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to be on the lookout for any use of these powers that goes beyond what public health experts are recommending as necessary, and that intrude on civil liberties,\u201d Goitein said.</p> <p>In offhand comments, Trump has occasionally expressed a reticence about the power of his office, which he elsewhere has described as unlimited.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of executive power, if we don\u2019t have to use it that would be a good thing, not a bad thing,\u201d he said at the White House last week. As late as Wednesday, Trump was resisting calls to invoke the Defense Production Act to get private businesses involved in mask and ventilator production, saying, \u201cWe hope we\u2019re not going to need it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3044778bfa1fcc6a503b5817444bff2200d26707\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3044778bfa1fcc6a503b5817444bff2200d26707/0_134_4015_2409/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\u2019s track record offers no reason to believe that he will eagerly accede to the contraction of powers that expanded in a time of emergency response, experts warn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump\u2019s track record offers no reason to believe that he will eagerly accede to the contraction of powers that expanded in a time of emergency response, experts warn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Baradat/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Berkeley law professor John Yoo, who crafted legal cover for torture programs in the George W Bush years, took a sanguine view of Trump\u2019s power and its containment.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s not a whole lot more I think that the president can do, unless we saw something much more serious occur such as the breakdown of law and order,\u201d said Yoo in a call-in forum hosted on Friday by the Federalist Society. \u201cEven then the president would need to rely on the request of state governors for assistance before he could intervene.\u201d</p> <p>But Trump\u2019s track record offers no reason to believe that he will eagerly accede to the contraction of powers that expanded in a time of emergency response, said Goitein, of the Brennan Center.</p> <p>\u201cIf you divorce his emergency orders from the context of every other thing he\u2019s ever said or done, you might be able to believe that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you put it in the context of a president who has said that article II gives him the power to do anything he wants, and a president who has ordered officials not to comply with congressional subpoenas, and a president who has said that Congress does not have the authority to impeach him \u2013 then I think you absolutely have to be worried.\u201d</p>",

I pulled on some leggings, pushed back the table and repurposed the kitchen counter as a barre.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcT9uRJqCrE\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fcT9uRJqCrE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Rojo explains each exercise while a few dancers are spread out in the background. The sound and lighting in the studio aren\u2019t great, but that doesn\u2019t impinge on the pleasure of spying the latest dancer fashions, the many incomprehensible layers they wear to keep warm \u2013 puffy boots, shorty dungarees and Rojo rocking one full-legwarmer in red and black stripes. All of these are gradually shed as the class goes on, to reveal a ballet butterfly underneath.</p> \n<p>The pianist strikes up and it\u2019s straight into some tendus (pushing the foot along the floor into a point), then lifting the leg to make tiny circles in the air \u2013 if you\u2019ve done a barre fitness class, you\u2019ll know this special kind of torture. A great sweeping port de bras, bending forward and (supposedly) doubling over at the waist, sees my hamstrings yelp into action.</p> \n<p>Inevitably, as the dancers\u2019 quicksilver feet pick up speed, and out of nowhere Rojo\u2019s leg whooshes effortlessly up to her ear, they leave me far behind. I stop to marvel at a backbend. It\u2019s in the very fabric of a dancer\u2019s art to make it look easy, and after you\u2019ve watched a lot of ballet you can become a bit blase about this crazy level of athleticism. But to dance along with a class is to physically feel how exceptional their ability is, and to observe the details of their technique undistracted.</p> \n<p>Apart from hitting my knee on the dining table doing a pirouette, this was a welcome interlude to the day. When you\u2019re cooped up inside (or usually hunched over a laptop), even just standing up straight, lifting your chin and majestically sweeping an arm above your head fills your lungs with air and your heart with peace. At which point the reality of current circumstances intrudes and my two-year-old bowls in demanding, \u201cI want a biscuit, mummy! I want telly!\u201d and all that zen calm crumbles.

  "<p>In the hedgerows the blackthorn is shooting sprays of small white blossom upwards, thus signalling the end of the winter. If this is so, then we have had an exceptionally warm and wet season. Perhaps counter-intuitively, such weather can spell disaster for many insects; adapted as they are to sitting out a season, their biggest enemies become mould and bacteria that may proliferate in their dormant tissues. Concern turns to the potential impact on already struggling populations of insects that have faced so many challenges in recent times, most blatantly the fragmentation and pollution of their habitats.

Would you want to live an extra year if you spent it in a nursing home? Would you rather risk your life for a chance at cure or accept a lesser intervention to preserve quality? If your dementia was worsening, what would you want done about an asymptomatic cancer?</p> <p>Now we are in the grip of the coronavirus pandemic shown to particularly imperil the elderly with chronic comorbidities (ie the majority of cancer patients) although it increasingly seems the young cannot afford to be complacent either. The usual dilemmas of oncologists are suddenly compounded by a pressing new question: which cancer patients should be continuing their chemotherapy?</p> <p>This is a broad question with the usual caveat: \u201cIt depends.\u201d It depends on the individual, the diagnosis, the type, duration and intent of treatment. It also depends on a patient\u2019s philosophy and a clinician\u2019s preparedness to ponder harm and benefit. Medical conversations in a cancer clinic are necessarily imbued with ethical implications but now is the time to approach them with particular clarity and sensitivity. Given the predicted pressure on elective surgery, resource availability, supply movement and frontline staff, it is imperative to reassess the needs of every patient, not only the ones who express concern.</p> <p>Field experts are circulating their suggestions in a rapidly evolving space. Meanwhile, here are some questions that all chemotherapy patients should ask their oncologist.</p> <h2><strong>Why am I having chemotherapy?</strong></h2> <p>In general, chemotherapy is given before an operation to render surgery more successful, or afterwards to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence. It\u2019s sometimes combined with radiotherapy to improve outcomes. In these cases, the intent is cure. Many common cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage; therefore, many more patients receive palliative chemotherapy, intended to halt progression and extend life but without the prospect of a cure.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1204410\">landmark study</a>, the majority of patients with a poor prognosis believed they were receiving chemotherapy for a cure. <a href=\"https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2001.19.1.72?journalCode=jco\">Decisional regret</a> is common among cancer patients; people who do not clearly understand the goals of chemotherapy cannot make decisions in their best interest.</p> <p>This is not news to oncologists, but now we have an even greater responsibility to ensure that the decision to continue chemotherapy has been made deliberately.</p> <h2><strong>How does my treatment benefit me?</strong></h2> <p>Many patients never ask this question for fear of sounding ungrateful, but the basis of shared decision-making is to use professional expertise to help individual priorities.</p> <p>It\u2019s important for patients to understand how many people in their situation will derive benefit and what that benefit looks like. Will treatment alleviate symptoms, delay cancer progression or prolong life? Each goal is important but different.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/so-you-think-you-have-coronavirus-what-australians-should-do-if-they-are-unwell\">So you think you have coronavirus: what Australians should do if they are unwell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Patients are often astonished to hear that common therapies offer less than 5% benefit. The more lines of chemotherapy, the less the chance of success. Hand in hand with benefit goes harm. The mortality rate of curative intent chemotherapy is quoted between 0.5 and 4%. In one study, 7.5% of elderly patients receiving combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy for lung cancer died during treatment. And as many patients discover, impairment can persist long after treatment.</p> <p>A<a href=\"https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.19.02035\"> timely editorial</a> reminds oncologists of \u201cthe efficacy-effectiveness gap\u201d. To demonstrate the greatest efficacy, clinical trials select the fittest patients with the least comorbidities. But real-world patients are completely different \u2013 they are older, sicker and rarely treated at academic centres, therefore treatments that looked promising in clinical trials don\u2019t always translate into effectiveness for the individual patient.</p> <p>Patients deserve the best of modern medicine minus the worst of complications, which is why fully informed consent takes on an additional significance during a pandemic.</p> <h2><strong>Have my risks changed?</strong></h2> <p>The usual high risks of chemotherapy are magnified during a pandemic. Immunosuppressed patients are more prone to infections and many chemotherapy agents cause mucositis, thus breaching a natural protective barrier. Frequent tests and chemotherapy visits expose already vulnerable patients to pathogens and other sick patients. Mortality from the coronavirus appears higher in cancer patients. Being at risk doesn\u2019t necessarily mean abandoning useful treatment. But shared decision-making is essential to mitigating some risks and being prepared to handle others.</p> <h2><strong>Can I consider another therapy?</strong></h2> <p>Patients harbour a great fear of foregoing treatment, often viewing it as their failure. But evidence shows that more isn\u2019t necessarily better, and chemotherapy may be safely de-escalated, paused or even stopped without causing harm. Experts suggest a review of new and ongoing therapies to determine options including oral substitutes.</p> <p>Where intensive chemotherapy remains advisable, in-person visits must be reduced. Injections to maintain blood counts and oral medications taken at home to reduce nausea, anxiety and allergies may be ways to reduce the time in the infusion centre.</p> <p>A word about immunotherapy agents, whose promise though not peril, is often mentioned. While distinct from chemotherapy, they are responsible for a host of immune-related complications, the most relevant of which is pneumonitis. This drug-induced lung inflammation can be difficult to distinguish from a viral infection; furthermore, conventional treatment of pneumonitis with high-dose steroids may impede recovery from coronavirus-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome.</p> <p>Combination immunotherapy drugs typically cause substantially greater toxicity than single agents and there is emerging evidence that stopping immunotherapy in selected patients can be associated with durable responses. Patients on immunotherapy merit a detailed discussion about which agents to continue.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-what-happens-to-peoples-lungs-if-they-get-covid-19\">Coronavirus: what happens to people's lungs if they get Covid-19?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>What happens if I become unwell?</strong></h2> <p>Mild illnesses in other patients can become catastrophic for cancer patients. Confused by instructions or reluctant to attend hospital, patients may minimise their symptoms. Every cancer patient must know whom to call and where to go in case of concern. Queuing at a fever clinic or calling a general helpline may squander the opportunity for urgent care. Emergency professionals aren\u2019t familiar with all the nuances of cancer treatment and information isn\u2019t always readily transferrable across institutions. Therefore, it is vital for patients to self-identify as high-risk and carry basic information about themselves.</p> <h2><strong>Can we discuss an advance care directive?</strong></h2> <p>The truth is no one wants to dwell on their mortality, not doctors, not their patients. Despite widespread recognition of the resulting harm, a discussion about end-of-life care remains a second-order task in clinic. Many people worry that in pressured times, the sickest and oldest patients will be denied intensive care but in fact, these patients face such poor outcomes that it is in their best interest to receive good palliative care from the outset. <a href=\"https://www.advancecareplanning.org.au/get-involved/read-the-latest-advance-care-planning-news/article/2020/03/23/covid-19-is-it-time-for-australians-to-make-future-medical-decisions#/\">Advance care directives</a> return control to patients, which is why we must discuss them proactively but sensitively.</p> <p>Finally, to something that is unspoken but important. Patients invest great trust in professionals, but what happens when those very professionals become uncertain? Can we trust shaken doctors to guide shaken patients?</p> <p>I think the answer is yes.</p> <p>A profession with its share of discord and disharmony is coalescing in unforeseen ways. There is a genuine understanding across the workforce that the only way to face this crisis is together. Humbled by a virus and equal in our vulnerability, there is a newfound concern and care for each other. Our better angels have declared themselves.</p> <p>Over 2,000 years ago, Hippocrates observed that the highest aim of medicine was to \u201ccure sometimes, treat often, comfort always\u201d.

It\u2019s looking like it\u2019s heading to 50,000 or more deaths \u2013 deaths, not cases. 50,000 deaths \u2013 which is, that\u2019s a lot. And you look at automobile accidents, which are far greater than any numbers we\u2019re talking about. That doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to tell everybody no more driving of cars. So we have to do things to get our country open.\u201d</p> <p>Yet last Friday, when the car accident argument was put to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-c-oronavirus-task-force-press-briefing/\">he said:</a> \u201cThat\u2019s totally way out.

Trump: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t not agree.\u201d</p> <p>But the president was joined by coronavirus task force response coordinator, Deborah Birx. She noted: \u201cI was not here over the weekend... Saturday, I had a little low-grade fever...\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1242226099683237888?s=20\">Trump interjected \u201cUh, oh!\u201d</a> and cartoonishly recoiled to a distance. Attorney General William Barr smiled devotedly. Birx added: \u201cI got a test late Saturday night and I am negative.\u201d</p> <p>Trump gave an exaggerated, \u201cPhew!\u201d Again Barr smiled. But the room did not erupt in mirth. The president also mentioned that his wife, Melania, had taken a test that came back negative.</p> <p>Barr was on hand to discuss Trump\u2019s executive order to stop hoarding and price gouging. \u201cIf you have a big supply of toilet paper in your house, this is not something you have to worry about,\u201d the attorney general said. \u201cBut if you are sitting on a warehouse with masks, surgical masks, you will be hearing a knock on your door.\u201d</p> <p>In another reversal, Trump is dialling back his constant references to the \u201cChinese virus\u201d amid media reports of hate crimes against Asian Americans. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States and all around the world. They\u2019re amazing people and the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way shape or form.\u201d</p> <p>The briefing finished at 8pm. Trump and co-pilot Pence returned to the cockpit.

According to research published in the <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry\">British Journal of Psychiatry</a>, North America and Europe experienced 10,000 more suicides during the 2008 recession.

Then, if they test positive, for all intents and purposes they\u2019re likely to be immune (when they recover). If they don\u2019t have Covid they can work. If they do have Covid, they can self-isolate.</p> \n   <p>A lot of healthcare workers are in relationships with other healthcare workers. Children have fevers or coughs all the time. If you lose staff for 14 days every time they have a fever or cough or have contact (with someone with symptoms or who has tested positive) that is a problem. We\u2019ve got to test the medical staff and potentially even test their contacts. </p> \n   <p>The crux of this is having enough doctors and nurses and ventilators. We are in week four of a crisis.

There is nothing particularly surprising about its arguments \u2013 you will have read many of them in the Guardian, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/22/the-guardian-view-on-the-coronavirus-crisis-much-worse-is-to-come\">our leader today</a> says \u201cas we career into highly dangerous and uncharted waters, it is right to ask whether our ship\u2019s captain is up to the job\u201d - but Johnson expects to be criticised by the Guardian. If the Times is having a go at him too, that will cause more concern in No 10.</p> \n  <p>On the plus side for Johnson, the Times leader is qualified. The general thrust of it is more \u201cmust do better\u201d than \u201ccompletely useless\u201d. Here is an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The truth is that [Boris Johnson\u2019s] performance so far has been chequered. Since the start he has appeared behind the curve. Considerable time that could have been spent preparing for the crisis appears to have been squandered. The World Health Organisation first warned of the risk of a deadly global pandemic in mid-January, by which point the coronavirus was spreading rapidly in China and parts of Asia. Yet the government spent much of February apparently distracted with fights with some of Britain\u2019s institutions, including the civil service, the judiciary and the BBC. Even at the time many questioned why the prime minister disappeared from view for a week in the middle of the month to his grace-and-favour home in Kent. He did not preside over his first Cobra meeting to discuss the crisis until March 3. Even as the scale became apparent, Mr Johnson\u2019s response to it has been uneven. For the most of the first half of March, the official advice was simply to wash one\u2019s hands. On March 12, as countries across Europe and the world closed schools, restaurants, bars and shops and introduced lockdowns and travel bans, the government merely advised that those ill with coronavirus symptoms should self-isolate for seven days ...</p> \n   <p>Mr Johnson\u2019s liberal instincts and reluctance to restrict civil liberties would normally be admirable. But dithering over whether to shut schools, bars and restaurants, combined with anonymous briefings warning of imminent lockdowns that are then ruled out by ministers, may have only made the crisis worse. Panicked shoppers have stripped supermarkets of supplies while many Londoners will have escaped to the country, almost certainly further spreading the virus. City traders say that doubts about Mr Johnson\u2019s response contributed to the run on sterling. Britain\u2019s death toll is now at the same level as Italy\u2019s two weeks ago, yet already one hospital says that it has been overwhelmed and the NHS is warning of shortages of ventilators and protective clothing ...</p> \n   <p>And if the government is forced to introduce even more stringent restrictions to halt an escalating epidemic, they may ask why they weren\u2019t introduced sooner, as they have been in much of the rest of the world. The country needs to know that Mr Johnson has a coherent strategy. Otherwise the prime minister who dreamt of being Churchill may find himself cast as Neville Chamberlain.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-23T10:44:46.867Z\">at 10.44am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7890d88f08dcc95cc2169a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-23T10:38:03.113Z\">10.38am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Health minister <strong>Nadine Dorries</strong> is returning to work in Westminster after recovering from Covid-19. </p> \n  <p>She said on Twitter: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Good to be back in the saddle and able to play my part to help our PM, cabinet and the scientists who are working around the clock to keep us safe and #SaveLives.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NadineDorries/status/1242034640698867713\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">On my way back to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DHSCgovuk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@DHSCgovuk</a> and Parliament for the passing of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#coronavirus</a> bill.

They say they are concerned that \u201chighly exposed\u201d NHS staff are currently not being tested as the pandemic takes hold and the UK hurtles towards Italy-style levels of infection. </p> \n  <p>In a letter sent to the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt, who chairs the Commons health committee, they estimate that the real number of infected cases in the UK is likely to be 15 times higher than \u201crecorded\u201d cases of those tested so far, which only takes place in hospitals. On current numbers this would mean around 150,000 people currently have the virus in the UK, with the vast majority undiagnosed. Morris writes:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Germany has been testing at least four times as many people per population, and as a result has the lowest morbidity per capita of cases recorded in Europe. I attribute their success is by testing people and catching a positive test in their initial asymptomatic phase of infection, ie the first 5 days after inoculation before they notice symptoms. By quarantining this cohort early, it slows down spread and applied nationally will \u2018flatten the curve\u2019.</p> \n   <p>The new recorded UK cases are \u2018probably\u2019 1/15th the actual cases. The problem is \u2018probably\u2019. Testing will allow the NHS to prepare for the cases. Our model will define this.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The consultants argue that mass testing in line with their proposals will save more than 70% of deaths estimated over the next six months, mostly patients over 60. They have written to Boris Johnson and spoken to Hunt and to Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer.

Here are the main points he has been making.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hancock confirmed that the government was considering moving towards a European-style near-curfew, which would involve people being told not to leave home unless they had a specific reason for doing so. </strong>Asked if this was an option, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Of course we\u2019re looking at what other European countries are doing ... All the way through we have said we are prepared to take the actions that are necessary, and we are.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He said that parks, where people did not observe the two-metre rule, were a particular problem. Asked if there could be stricter enforcement of these rules, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can\u2019t say any more on the detail of it because these are discussions that are live, that are ongoing and we are considering it.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He did not rule out the government using the police to enforce social distancing rules.</strong> Asked if the government might have to use the police, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Yes, and in fact on Saturday I signed <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/327/pdfs/uksi_20200327_en.pdf?utm_source=hootsuite&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=post\">the order</a> to give the police the power to shut restaurants and bars and pubs if they\u2019re still open. This isn\u2019t the sort of thing that I wanted to do. But it\u2019s the sort of thing that as a nation we\u2019ve got to be prepared to see in order to stop this virus.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The Daily Mail\u2019s <strong>Jason Groves</strong> says he thought Hancock sounded like someone arguing behind the scenes for a full lockdown.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JasonGroves1/status/1242003138758037505\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Listening to health sec Matt Hancock it is pretty plain he's pushing for a full lock down.

And the actions that we have taken over the last week ... are unprecedented. And taking those decisions is a huge thing.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He also rejected the suggestion that Johnson did not deliver a clear message about social distancing at his press conference yesterday. When this was put to him, Hancock said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, the message yesterday was incredibly clear, and it is across every single front page, which is that if people don\u2019t follow the rules, we are going to have to get tougher still.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hancock said that people who were ignoring the two-metre distance rule in parks yesterday were \u201cvery selfish\u201d and were putting lives at risk.</strong> Asked why people were ignoring the guidance, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, I don\u2019t know, because it is very selfish. The NHS is doing everything it can and preparing for this spread of this virus. And if people go within two metres of others who they don\u2019t live with, then they are helping to spread the virus, and the consequence of that costs lives, and it means for everyone this will on for longer.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The first words of that answer were also interesting, because Hancock claimed not to know why people were ignoring the two-metre rule. Others have argued that people are ignoring this rule because Johnson and his government have not spelled it out with sufficient clarity. This is what<strong> Rosena Allin-Khan</strong>, a candidate for the Labour deputy leadership and an A&amp;E doctor told the Today programme this morning, having spent the weekend working in her local hospital. She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The prime minister simply said yesterday he wants people to enjoy themselves outside while also saying that people should stay two metres apart outdoors. This relaxed style, mixed messaging will cost lives and I believe people are struggling to follow guidelines because they are just not clear.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The Labour MP <strong>Yvette Cooper </strong>has also posted a detailed critique of the government\u2019s messaging in a Twitter thread starting here.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/YvetteCooperMP/status/1241849797155393537\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I watched the Prime Minister\u2019s press conference in despair.

Jurors summoned for this week are being contacted to ask them to remain at home, and contact the court they are due to attend. They will only be asked to come in for trials where specific arrangements to ensure safety have been put in place.

But he said he remained optimistic.</p> \n  <p>Germany has closed all its schools, and on Sunday ruled that no more than two people can gather at once, except for families or people sharing a household.</p> \n  <p>Wieler said that current data on Germany\u00b4s Covid 19 cases indicates that the average age of those infected is 45, the average age of those who have died is 82. Fifty-seven per cent of those with confirmed infections have so far been men, 43% are women. Of the symptoms people have experienced, the most common is coughing (55%) and fever (40%).</p> \n  <p>In his daily briefing, which has just ended, he appealed to German medical students to volunteer in the increasing effort to track all new cases, which he said continued to be an important part in the fight against the virus. </p> \n  <p>A nationwide collection data point called Cosmos, which is gathering data on how the illness is being fought, shows a considerable increase in awareness of the virus, but still a considerable gap between awareness and behaviour, he said. Mobile phone data monitored anonymously at the weekend, of 30 million mobile phone users, showed that people have considerably reduced their mobility, but still not as much as was necessary, he said. Keeping a distance, regular hand washing and sneezing or coughing into the elbow still remained the most effective ways to avoid the spread of coronavirus, he added. \u201cKeeping your distance is the order of the day,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>There are about 24,859 cases of coronavirus in Germany.
