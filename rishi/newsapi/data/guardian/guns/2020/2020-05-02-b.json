  "<p>A young film-maker who worked on a music video that mocked Egyptian president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi has died in an Egyptian prison, after he was imprisoned without trial for more than two years.</p> <p>Shady Habash, 24, died inside Cairo\u2019s infamous Tora prison complex, from \u201chealth issues not yet specified,\u201d according to announcements from family and friends.</p> <p>Habash\u2019s detention and death represent a stark reminder of the growing number of young people at risk inside Egypt\u2019s sprawling prison system, including many detained for their work as artists, making dissenting statements against Sisi\u2019s rule or for no charge at all.</p> <p>There is also growing concern over unsanitary and unsafe mass detentions inside Egyptian prisons, reflecting fears about the spread of Covid-19 in places of detention around the world. Prominent activist Alaa Abdel al-Fattah, re-imprisoned last September, recently began a hunger strike in protest at prison conditions. The Egyptian authorities, who <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde12/2152/2020/en/\">suspended</a> prison visits in March due to the coronavirus outbreak, have been criticised for widespread and deadly medical neglect of prisoners, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/17/mohamed-morsi-dead-ousted-president-egypt-collapses-after-court-session\">former president Moham</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/17/mohamed-morsi-dead-ousted-president-egypt-collapses-after-court-session\">ed Morsi</a>, who collapsed and died in court in June 2019.</p> <p>Mai al-Sedany, an expert on the Egyptian legal system with the Washington thinktank the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, said that Habash\u2019s death highlights rising concern around a lack of due process in Egypt. This includes \u201ca rise in prosecution around freedom of expression, continued and near automatic pretrial detention extensions in violation of even Egyptian law, and poor prison conditions that severely harm the well-being of those incarcerated,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The young artist was detained in March 2018, after directing a music video for the exiled Egyptian rock musician Ramy Essam. The video sees Essam, who now lives in Sweden, dancing as he criticises the rule of Egyptian president Sisi, comparing him to a date or \u201cbalaha\u201d, the name of a character in a popular comedy film used against Sisi by his critics. \u201cYou live in gardens and we live in jails,\u201d he sings, \u201cmay the Lord take you we all pray, with all your gang boys in that darkest jail, I hope you rot in such a place.\u201d</p> <p>The video\u2019s release prompted the arrest of eight people, most with little connection to Essam.

  "<p>Respiratory physician Dr David Darley says something peculiar happens to a small group of Covid-19 patients on day seven of their symptoms.</p> <p>\u201cUp until the end of that first week, they\u2019re stable,\u201d says Darley, a doctor with Sydney\u2019s St Vincent\u2019s Hospital. \u201cAnd then suddenly, they have this hyper-inflammatory response.

These patients who are severe tend to be older, they are more likely to be men, and also have other medical problems like diabetes, high blood pressure or cardiovascular disease.\u201d</p> <p>But there is no way of knowing which patients will be affected by the most severe symptoms. Clinicians like Darley hope that a disease biomarker \u2013 a unique characteristic in the blood, body fluids, or tissues \u2013 will eventually be discovered for each stage.</p> <p>\u201cIt would help clinicians predict what stage patients are at and maybe even if they will progress to the next stage of disease,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could help us predict who needs to be more closely observed in hospitals and would mean we have all the systems ready to go if they worsen. And it would give us more confidence to have them discharged to home if a biomarker says they are low risk for developing severe illness.\u201d</p> <p>Darley is one of the researchers working on a long-term St Vincent\u2019s study of patients admitted to the hospital with Covid-19. Patients will be followed for a year after being discharged, receiving tests at regular intervals to see if there are any lasting effects or changes in the body\u2019s immune system and blood. They will also be assessed for any ongoing changes to lung, gut and brain functions. No <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/coronavirus-what-do-scientists-know-about-covid-19-so-far\">one yet knows</a> if the virus causes permanent or long-term harm.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s clear yet whether it\u2019s the virus infecting the lungs and the blood vessels, or if it\u2019s the body\u2019s immune system which goes out of control which then causes lung and blood vessel injury,\u201d Darley said. \u201cOr, it could be a combination of both.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"983563080ca41ee9240f1509a47dfe0c7e34ec41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/983563080ca41ee9240f1509a47dfe0c7e34ec41/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A electron microscope image showing spherical particles of the novel coronavirus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A electron microscope image showing spherical particles of the novel coronavirus, colourised blue, from the first US case of Covid-19.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah A Bullock, Azaibi Tamin/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe pathogenesis is not clear yet. We are observing brain inflammation in a subset of patients, and in those we are seeing agitation and a change in behaviour or personality. That\u2019s really interesting, and there are reports coming from elsewhere of some people, including younger patients, suffering stroke. It\u2019s unclear whether the virus is infecting the lining cells of blood vessels in the brain, or whether the patient\u2019s blood is excessively prone to clotting because of all the inflammation, leading to stroke.\u201d</p> <p>A renowned intensive care specialist from Italy, Prof Luciano Gattinoni, said this type of clotting in respiratory diseases is \u201cextremely unusual\u201d. </p> <p>The 75-year-old has been working in intensive care for 40 years, and said he has never seen anything like what is happening to the lungs of some Covid-19 patients. What is particularly baffling is patients are presenting with poor oxygenation but little lung damage. This type of presentation is more typical of patients suffering from altitude sickness than a viral infection, Gattignoni says. As a result, patients who are very sick may not feel like they\u2019re really struggling to breathe \u2013 even as they\u2019re being critically deprived of oxygen.</p> <p>\u201cHow is this possible?\u201d Gattinoni told Guardian Australia from the intensive care department of the German hospital where he is working as a guest professor. \u201cBad oxygenation and good lungs tells me this must have something to do with the blood vessels. But these vessels are everywhere. In the brain. In the kidneys. So, in some patients, many organs are affected.\u201d</p> <p>The problem is, mechanical ventilation in intensive care replaces the strength of the respiratory muscles. If patients are struggling to breathe but their lung structure is OK, this ventilation does little to help and in fact may prove harmful, Gattinoni said, because mechanical ventilation is invasive. </p> <p>He said while only a small number of patients are severe enough to require ventilation, a significant proportion of those on ventilators die, continuing to show low blood oxygen levels despite mechanical assistance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45c1883601c52e3954d44abf8121b7e074e3b19c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45c1883601c52e3954d44abf8121b7e074e3b19c/0_0_7200_4950/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nurses tend to a patient on a ventilator at a New York hospital\" width=\"1000\" height=\"688\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nurses tend to a patient on a ventilator at a New York hospital.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gattinoni said doctors must use ventilators only when needed, and at the right time. Getting this right can improve survival rates, he believes, and he thinks wrongly timed ventilation is why some intensive care units treating Covid-19 patients have higher death rates than others.</p> <p>\u201cTiming with this disease is absolutely critical,\u201d he said. \u201cVentilation cannot begin too early or too late.\u201d In the meantime, patients are given anticoagulants, drugs that prevent or slow blood clotting in the hope that stroke can be prevented.</p> <p>Darley said scans of the lungs of Covid-19 patients are unique, showing \u201cground glass opacity\u201d, a hazy pattern that does not obscure the underlying lung structure. Lung cancer, for example, would typically show on a scan as a dark, solid lesion, obscuring other structures in the lungs. While other illnesses, for example bacterial infections, can result in ground glass opacity on a scan, there were some unusual features on scans for Covid-19, Darley said.</p> <p>\u201cIt has a classic pattern in Covid,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He suspects men are more severely affected than women because the virus is activated by an enzyme controlled by androgens, a group of hormones that play a role in male characteristics. But more research is needed to test this hypothesis. Darley added that any research into the virus needed to be conducted ethically and with strong scientific protocols.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/what-is-the-new-illness-affecting-children-and-is-it-linked-to-coronavirus\">What is the new illness affecting children, and is it linked to coronavirus?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWith no treatments for this virus, all we can do for severe patients at the moment is provide supportive care,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the level of fluid is low, we can replace it. If they need ventilation, we can help them breathe. But treatments for this disease can only come from clinical trials. </p> <p>\u201cOur commitment at our hospital is to work with the highest level of scientific inquiry. People are desperate for treatments but we are reluctant to try treatments outside of clinical trials here. </p> <p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t clearly show a treatment is better than placebo or other treatments, we could be creating noise and adding to the current chaos of the scientific community. Our responsibility is to find treatments that work.\u201d</p> <p>Gattinoni agrees. He said scientists had been trying for decades to find drugs that moderate the inflammatory reaction, and he said these drugs had been \u201cromanticised and popularised\u201d in the race to find treatments for Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cBut in thousands of experiments over the years trying to block inflammatory responses, we\u2019ve only had a lot of poor results,\u201d Gattinoni said. \u201cLike many other things in medicine, we have to be patient.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>With each week the plans become a little more refined and with each week any final decision is pushed back. Football may return, and this is how it may look if it does, but nobody is sure, and any proposed date can only be provisional. Which is as it should be. In an age that often favours decisiveness over the decision itself, there is something vaguely comforting about a process that accepts the wisdom of waiting.</p> \n<p>But in the background there is a crucial, nagging voice, and what it is saying is this: if football isn\u2019t prepared to return, at least initially, in a form very different to the one it took before the virus, it may not return for a very long time \u2013 and for many clubs that means never.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/may/01/premier-league-must-exercise-caution-in-return-fraught-with-lethal-hazards\">Premier League must exercise caution in return fraught with lethal hazards | David Conn</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Various fan bodies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/23/bundesliga-return-in-may-now-looks-inevitable-but-fans-are-far-from-happy\">particularly in Germany</a>, have protested about the prospect of football returning behind closed doors.

The accusation is of the authorities and clubs acting not for reasons of sport but finance, a tension that has existed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/apr/04/the-english-game-netflix\">since the advent of professionalism</a> 140 years ago. At some point, though, the two intersect.</p> \n<p>Football long ago abased itself before the capitalist altar and, while it would be preferable if more than lip service were paid to the idea the game has a community role, that it is not merely a business and didn\u2019t exist simply to make the rich even richer, equally there has to be some realism.</p> \n<p>Clubs, however socially responsible, need revenue to survive. In Europe\u2019s big five leagues, a high proportion of that revenue is derived from broadcasting rights and to generate that games need to be played.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27fc91c59bb8c176d87e26e848f072705ecb22f1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27fc91c59bb8c176d87e26e848f072705ecb22f1/0_188_5064_3038/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Schalke players training at a distance in Gelsenkirchen on 29 April, as the Bundesliga prepares for a possible resumption\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Schalke players training at a distance in Gelsenkirchen on 29 April, as the Bundesliga prepares for a possible resumption.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Friedemann Vogel/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>One of the reasons Dutch clubs seem to have reacted with relative equanimity to their government\u2019s decision to ban all public events until at least 1 September is that the pressure from broadcasters in the Netherlands is nowhere near as intense. The outcry in France after a similar decision would almost certainly have been louder \u2013 and various clubs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/01/amiens-vow-to-fight-ligue-1-relegation-after-injustice-of-season-resolution\">are considering their legal options</a> \u2013 had a new, far more lucrative television deal not been beginning next season.</p> \n<p>There has also been a quasi-moral argument raised, that there is something distasteful about plotting a return to live sport when people are still dying in their hundreds by the day. And perhaps there is; it\u2019s easy to imagine how modern football\u2019s combination of glitz and pettiness could jar with a general mood of sombreness.</p> \n<p>But it\u2019s not to diminish the unique nature of the coronavirus crisis or the tragedy of those deaths to observe that all life goes on all the time against a background of mortality. At some point, as the risk of contagion recedes, lockdown will ease and some version of some variant of life will begin again.</p> \n<p>Judging that point is, of course, enormously difficult, and where football should lie on the list of priorities can be debated. But the two principal factors in making a decision must be safety and resources.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9b85317a-89a0-4171-9e43-9f96feb62f57\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Premier League statement on Friday notably emphasised that clubs \u201cwill only return to training and playing with government guidance, under expert medical advice and after consultation with players and managers\u201d.</p> \n<p>What is clear is the clubs have no desire to make any call without official support and that there is no appetite on the part of the government to institute the sort of ban seen in the Netherlands and France. That football could be considering a return in Germany, Italy, Spain and England while suspended in two ostensibly similar neighbouring countries is bewildering, but given the easing of lockdown is necessarily a gradual process, perhaps it is only natural that different countries should have different concerns and take different steps first.</p> \n<p>Germany looks the country closest to a return, though the revelation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/01/three-cologne-players-test-positive-for-covid-19-as-training-continues\">three positive tests at Cologne</a> may affect those plans, perhaps before the end of this month.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The vital point, perhaps, is this: that measures may be necessary not only for this season but for next as well</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>That at least gives the Premier League an example of what football may look like, that minimising the risk to players will be complicated and require sacrifice and discipline is clear. To a layman, frankly, the processes look baffling and overwhelming, and it is entirely understandable that players should be concerned \u2013 and fully involved in any decision \u2013 but it may be their acceptance is the only way football can return without a wait of several months that could devastate clubs.</p> \n<p>Then there is the matter of resources. The guidance suggests players should be tested two or three times a week. Even if the tests are sourced privately, that clearly should not happen until staff in hospitals and other key positions \u2013 in shops, on public transport, in schools \u2013 are being tested regularly.</p> \n<p>Equally, there will have to be medical and security staff on duty at stadiums. Again, that cannot happen if they would be better deployed elsewhere. Those are matters on which football can only wait.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/01/amiens-vow-to-fight-ligue-1-relegation-after-injustice-of-season-resolution\">Amiens and Lyon threaten further action after Ligue 1 issues final table</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Using eight-to-10 neutral stadiums would seem a way of making the process more efficient: fewer arenas to adapt to the guidelines and keep clean, less risk of fans congregating. It is far from ideal but these are compromises that may have to be accepted for football to get under way again.</p> \n<p>And the vital point, perhaps, is this: that these measures may be necessary not only for this season but for next as well. Ending 2019-20 now, whatever method is used to determine positions and titles, promotion and relegation and European qualification, may resolve certain issues regarding contracts that are set to expire on 30 June, may allow prize money to be distributed (although probably not without legal challenges) and may answer some perceived need to be seen to be decisive, but the fundamental will remain: the virus will still be there.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Whether football returns in June or September, or later even than that, it will be a long time before it is played in stadiums packed with crowds of tens of thousands, without players having to undertake complex social distancing measures.

The Randox instructions that come with the kits state: \u201cTest kits are only valid for 48 hours after use.\u201d The 29-year-old told the Guardian:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> This means there could be hundreds of useless kits sent out to workers like myself.<br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>After calling the help centre, she was told there had been an influx of the same complaint and the advice was to order another one.</p> \n  <p>Similarly, Lou, a 31-year-old PR manager from London, was sent a kit without a return postage label enclosed. As a label couldn\u2019t be sent to her in time, Lou had a void sample and had to order a second kit to repeat the process. </p> \n  <p>Both women expressed concern over the delay in getting tested and also over whether the first testing kits they were sent would still count towards the government\u2019s daily testing figures.</p> \n  <p>The government was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/ministers-accused-of-changing-covid-19-test-tally-to-hit-100000-goal\">accused on Friday of bending the truth about how it passed its target of 100,000 tests a day</a>, amid reports that tests were being counted on dispatch rather than upon return to the lab.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/ministers-accused-of-changing-covid-19-test-tally-to-hit-100000-goal\">Hancock says UK hit 100,000 tests amid claims tally is artificially boosted</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>Jade also expressed concern that people would have trouble following the instructions to self-swab because, as she put it, testing for Covid-19 is \u201cquite invasive and very unpleasant for patients and the nurses doing it\u201d. This, she said, led her to fear many tests being sent out won\u2019t be utilised properly. </p> \n  <p>Lou said she had found the instructions \u201cexceedingly confusing\u201d and hard to follow. She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I mainly worry for those with severe symptoms, this delay could be really damaging and also the confusing nature of the instructions make it

resistance, which is \u201creally uncomfortable and difficult\u201d to do.</p> \n  <p>He said the difficulties with self-swabbing \u201cmeans that there will be a significant amount of people in whom

It found that changing the length of a lockdown \u2013 from eight to 12 or 16 weeks \u2013 would have an impact on the date at which any second wave might arrive, but only a marginal effect on the number of cases or deaths.</p> \n  <p>Another finding in the report claimed that the later a second period of lockdown was introduced \u2013 one that lasted for eight weeks \u2013 the bigger the reduction in any cases would be, compared to taking no lockdown action at all.</p> \n  <p>Communities with a younger average age of population would also extract greater benefit from a longer period of lockdown than one with an older population, according to the study. It found that any lockdown would save more lives amongst a younger community than an older one.</p> \n  <p>Dr Konstantin Blyuss, Reader in Mathematics at the University of Sussex, said: <br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Although in each case we explored, there will be a second epidemic peak after the quarantine is lifted, interestingly and quite counterintuitively, the later quarantine is introduced, the smaller this second peak will be. This reduction becomes quite substantial for quarantines introduced at a later stage.</p> \n   <p>Introducing an eight-week quarantine 10 weeks after the start of an outbreak reduces the magnitude of the peak in infected individuals by between 45% and 59% compared to no quarantine, and this reduces to only 8.5%-23.5% for a quarantine of the same duration introduced after six weeks.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Dr Yuliya Kyrychko, a reader in mathematics at the University of Sussex and one of the authors of the report, said the expanded effects of lockdown on young people could be explained by the likelihood of their being more socially mobile. She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A bigger impact of quarantine on reducing deaths in regions with younger populations can be attributed to a number of factors, such as the fact that younger people have more contacts and thus are making a bigger contribution to disease transmission, so quarantining them makes a bigger impact on reducing the overall disease burden.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T11:55:58.255Z\">at 12.55pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ead568e8f082b32fdd6bfc1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T11:16:51.070Z\">12.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e92e93d92f2969669fa66982b2d0553ae1873e4\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e92e93d92f2969669fa66982b2d0553ae1873e4/32_114_3077_1847/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mural in tribute to the NHS painted by artist Rachel List in Pontefract.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mural in tribute to the NHS painted by artist Rachel List in Pontefract.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lee Smith/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ead55ba8f082b32fdd6bfba\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/davidbatty\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T11:14:13.904Z\">12.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jeremy-deller\">artist Jeremy Deller</a> has called on middle-aged ravers to buy a poster he has produced in recognition of the plight of victims of domestic violence and care home residents during the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"http://www.pleasedonotbend.co.uk/work/bless-this-acid-house\">Sales of the print</a>, which says Bless this Acid House, will support Refuge, a charity for survivors of domestic abuse, and Pilgrims\u2019 Friend Society, which runs care homes across the UK.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_ra0jOlDZu/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Although a firm may be open for business, this does not mean it is business as usual.</p> \n   <p>Residential property transactions have ground to a halt. Reduction in court hearings has massively impacted on the amount of work available - while social distancing and the lack of face-to-face meetings is causing difficulty delivering in other areas, such as the execution of wills.</p> \n   <p>Elsewhere, small firms have suffered from the decline in overall activity - particularly from service industries such as retail, leisure and hospitality.</p> \n   <p>The fate of the high-street firm is thus intrinsically bound to that of other small businesses.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He said firms are struggling because although the government provides some relief, they are specifically excluded from support for small businesses, and are expected to continue paying business rates while their buildings are empty. There is therefore a growing fear that \u201cmany businesses will fall through the crack\u201d, he added.</p> \n  <p>Davis also said individual solicitors are also at risk, because some are not eligible for support for the self-employed, and those who are paid via dividends are in need of a support package.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T10:21:43.194Z\">at 11.21am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ead43238f087d47c7787fd7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/libbybrooks\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T09:56:13.263Z\">10.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>New polling shows extraordinarily high support for the SNP government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. </p> \n  <p>According to a YouGov survey for the Times Scotland, <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong> has the confidence of 71% of Scots when it comes to her ability to make the correct decisions in dealing with the virus, with 23% saying they do not have faith in her judgments.

Spokespeople from Montefiore did not return the Guardian\u2019s request for comment.</p> <p>In New York City, black women are nearly <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/ms/pregnancy-associated-mortality-report-2011-2015.pdf\">eight times more likely</a> to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women.

And, as Covid-19 overburdens already under-resourced hospitals and complicates how women give birth, experts fear pre-existing problems may get worse.</p> <p>Isaac died in the same hospital where her mother has worked for 25 years, after switching Montefiore facilities because she felt so mistreated at her original branch, under the care of a doctor she had known since she was a teenager.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/25/african-american-doula-collective-mothers-toxic-stress-racism-cleveland-infant-mortality-childbirth\">America has an infant mortality crisis.

But because of the pandemic, her routine doctor\u2019s visits turned into conference calls over Zoom, where she answered a few screening questions and checked her blood pressure.</p> <p>Isaac got updated bloodwork because she decided she wanted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/22/doulas-childbirth-coronavirus-pandemic\">hire a doula or midwife</a> for an at-home delivery during the pandemic, partially because she felt so neglected by the system, McIntyre said. But she was labeled too high-risk and needed a surgeon after she discovered her platelet counts were still falling.</p> <p>Isaac tried to raise the alarm and figure out what was happening, but her medical team at first ignored her calls. When she finally had blood work done and was later admitted to the hospital, she entered scared and alone \u2013 neither her mother nor McIntyre was initially allowed to join her.</p> <p>She died on 21 April, after being induced more than a month early, then rushed into an emergency C-section. The surgeon she had been assigned wasn\u2019t present.</p> <p>Aina said there has been an uptick in C-sections during the pandemic, after years of advocacy campaigns <a href=\"https://www.marchofdimes.org/news/march-of-dimes-and-partners-respond-to-alarming-rise-in-c-section-rates.aspx\">against </a>the invasive surgery\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.marchofdimes.org/news/march-of-dimes-and-partners-respond-to-alarming-rise-in-c-section-rates.aspx\">rising rates</a>.</p> <p>Now, Isaac\u2019s newborn Elias will live in an apartment that was meticulously planned for him by a mother who will never get to be a part of it.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very hard being in this home and imagining her here with us,\u201d McIntyre said. \u201cShe never got to even meet him. She never got to see him. And she was just so thrilled about having him.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>As the government considers a phased reopening of schools, let\u2019s hear it for parents who\u2019ve toughed it out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/21/pupils-begin-studying-at-home-a-challenge-for-them-parents-and-teachers\">home-schooling</a> their children. Well done, everyone, but you do realise that you\u2019re not real teachers, don\u2019t you?</p> <p>The phased reopening of schools looks set to be complicated, just as for many disadvantaged pupils home education has proved chaotic and calamitous, with long-term consequences for social injustice. Many children have accessed little, if any, online learning. It has emerged that the <a href=\"https://schoolsweek.co.uk/coronavirus-majority-of-free-laptops-wont-be-delivered-until-june/\">promised 200,000 laptops</a> to help them may not even arrive until late May/June. Schools have experienced huge difficulties trying to access the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-52488208\">free school meal voucher scheme</a>. I could go on, but the point seems clear enough: educators educate, but that\u2019s not all they do.</p> <p>Obviously, parents deserve praise, and lots of it. The lockdown continues to be challenging for children and carers alike \u2013 keeping on top of it is an enormous achievement. I know I\u2019m lucky to have a teenager in this situation, that it would have been totally different with a younger child requiring constant hands-on supervision. You\u2019d have to be a parenting saint not to sometimes find it stressful and difficult. Still, parents are only dealing with their child or children. Even after everything that\u2019s happened, how many of us could claim to truly comprehend what it\u2019s like to educate and care for whole classes, and entire schools, full of children?</p> <p>Whatever some of us may tell ourselves during these weeks, parents haven\u2019t been doing what teachers do. Not that they were supposed to \u2013 this has been an emergency, not some bizarre competitive parenting contest. However, had it been, it wouldn\u2019t even have been close. What has played out (if all went to plan) is more akin to a temporary parent-cum-teaching assistant, steered online by their school.</p> <p>It\u2019s not running a full class, or several of them, and doing everything else that educators do. The childcare aspect alone has hit home for parents during this period \u2013 the fact that schools enable them to do something as fundamental as go to work. Then there\u2019s the extracurricular stuff: the shocking amount of often unrecognised (and unpaid) proto-social work that goes on all over the country in Britain\u2019s poorer schools, with many teachers having to feed and clothe their most vulnerable pupils.</p> <p>So pat yourself on the back if you\u2019ve worked hard home-schooling your children, keeping them interested, happy and, of course, educated. At the same time, spare a thought for teachers who do all this, and more, but for many more children. People rightly applaud NHS staff and key workers, but perhaps our educators also deserve a lot more appreciation than they generally get. It\u2019s a tough job; sometimes the toughest parts aren\u2019t even in the official job description. During lockdown, parents may been committed, patient, resourceful and lots of other great and admirable things, but they have not been teachers.</p> <h2>Forget feminism - can we talk about my hair?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e4a7916b2023944141d90878279881b37f07284\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e4a7916b2023944141d90878279881b37f07284/0_190_5700_3420/1000.jpg\" alt=\"wastepaper basket\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018What is the Zoom etiquette for popping a wastepaper basket over your head?\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Image Source/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What is the feminist position on caring about resembling a lockdown hell-hag?

But with plenty of tangerine up in his grille, he rolls the ball back across the face of the box for Holden, who tees up Lofthouse for a speculative shot. Lofthouse smears a first-time diagonal effort towards the bottom left. Farm should parry, but the ball bounces just before it reaches his hands, hops gently over them, and in!

Lofthouse scored twice in the first half from \u201cdramatic breakaways\u201d, adding to goals from Doug Holden and Willie Moir as Bolton romped into a 4-0 half-time lead. As if that wasn\u2019t bad enough for Everton, their pain was compounded as striker Dave Hickson was forced to leave the pitch concussed for 15 minutes, and Tommy Clinton skewed a penalty wide just before the break.</p> <p><strong>But the Second Division strugglers - Everton are at a low ebb right now - came roaring back at Bolton in the second period. </strong>John Willie Parker pulled one back immediately, and though Lofthouse then hit a post, Everton went on to unleash an \u201conslaught\u201d: Peter Farrell slapped home a free kick and Parker added his second and Everton\u2019s third. But luck wasn\u2019t with the Merseysiders as they tried to reach Wembley for the first time in 20 years, and Bolton held on as \u201cthe game passed beyond the frontier of the normal into the realm of pure delirium\u201d. Worth the few shillings admission, huh? Final score: Bolton Wanderers 4-3 Everton.</p> <p><strong>Meanwhile at Villa Park, Blackpool and Tottenham were playing out a mini classic of their own. </strong>Stanley Matthews set up Bill Perry for the opening goal after seven minutes. Blackpool began to dominate, Matthews totally bossing Charlie Withers, but soon enough Spurs, champions of England just two years ago, began to get a grip. Their attacks \u201cswept and flowed\u201d, according to this very paper. \u201cOne glorious move went the length of the field with the ball on the ground and not a Blackpool player touching it.\u201d Eddie Baily headed against the bar, then Len Duquemin equalised at the start of a second half that would be all Tottenham.</p> <p><strong>But George Farm was inspired in the Blackpool goal, and the score remained 1-1 until the final minute ... </strong>at which point Spurs full back Alf Ramsey attempted to calmly poke a backpass into the hands of keeper Ted Ditchburn. The attempt ended in sad farce, Ramsey allowing the ball to clank off his thigh. Jackie Mudie nipped in to score an unanswerable winner. Ramsey walked off distraught. It was the sort of mistake that could destroy a man. That\u2019ll weigh heavy on him for a long time. You wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you never hear anything of him again.

Back in the day, he used to bang them in for ... of course he did ... Bolton Wanderers. Relentlessly so: he\u2019s their all-time leading scorer with 277 goals. As club captain, he lifted the FA Cup for the Trotters after the famous White Horse Final of 1923, and again three years later. Now having moved to the coast to manage Blackpool, he\u2019s hoping to make it third time lucky with the Seasiders, having lost the finals of 1948 and 1951. If his team prevail this afternoon, against his old club, it\u2019d surely be a story for the ages!</p> <p><strong>Having said all that, quite a lot of attention is being focused on Blackpool winger Stanley Matthews. Quite. A. <em>Lot</em>. </strong>The biggest star English football has produced to date is, at the age of 38, running out of time to win the FA Cup medal that\u2019s eluded him all these years. Blackpool twice let the lead slip against Manchester United in the 1948 final, they were undone by Newcastle cup specialist Jackie Milburn three years later, and many felt that was the old boy\u2019s last chance of a medal. Unexpectedly, here comes another. He really is boozing in the last-chance saloon this time. Is the idol of English football destined to end his career with nothing tangible to show for all his talent? It\u2019s unthinkable, but this is where we are.</p> <p><strong>Problem for Matthews, Smith and Blackpool is, Bolton are currently three for three in FA Cup finals at Wembley.</strong> Admittedly all of these triumphs came in the 1920s - in addition to the aforementioned finals starring Smith, they also won in 1929 - but footballers can be a superstitious lot, and every little helps. They\u2019ve also got a player of their own to rival the star power of Matthews: Nat Lofthouse, England\u2019s <em>Lion of Vienna</em>. Lofthouse is the newly crowned Football Writers\u2019 Player of the Year. And what a year! He scored 22 goals in the First Division, six in a challenge match between the Football League and the League of Ireland, and has found the net in every round of the cup so far. He\u2019s knocking them in at a prodigious rate for both club and country. Who knows, he may one day threaten Joe Smith\u2019s club record. Good luck stopping him today.</p> <p><strong>But y\u2019know, good luck stopping both of these attacks.</strong> Matthews and Lofthouse are flanked by a top-class supporting cast: Bolton forwards Willie Moir, Harold Hassall and Bobby Langton are all internationals, while Blackpool striker Stan Mortensen has been matching Lofthouse goal for goal in an England shirt. Throw in the results of the two league encounters this season - a 3-0 win for Blackpool and a 4-0 win for Bolton - and this has the promise to be a lot of fun. Can Blackpool win their first cup, and with it that precious medal for Matthews? Or will Bolton Wanderers lift the famous pot for the fourth time and break the old boy\u2019s heart? We\u2019ll find out soon enough. It\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick-off: </strong>3pm.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbec1a18803b1185d264430da659a57e9d43cca1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbec1a18803b1185d264430da659a57e9d43cca1/0_0_4096_2891/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blackpool fans roam the streets of London before the game.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blackpool fans roam the streets of London before the game.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T12:33:23.548Z\">at 1.33pm BST</time></p>  </div>",
  "<p>Until recently, Mike Hadreas was not a particularly emotional person. That may come as a surprise to fans of Perfume Genius, the name under which he releases gorgeous, theatrical, emotionally raw music. \u201cI think for a while my main emotions were either laughing, or just sort of irritated. The two modes, for years really,\u201d he says.</p> <p>But all of that has changed. He has moved cities, grown older, and learned how to dance. \u201cEven though I feel kind of unhinged and confused, it\u2019s where I need to be right now, and it\u2019s part of me going somewhere else, somewhere better. For however long it is.\u201d His new album, <em><a href=\"https://store.matadorrecords.com/set-my-heart-on-fire-immediately\">Set My Heart on Fire Immediately</a></em>, is about this arrival of big feelings, and a hunger for human connection, but for now human connection is on hold.</p> <p>We were supposed to meet in London at the beginning of March, but, with the global crisis growing, that was scrapped and now we\u2019re talking over FaceTime. \u201cI kind of had a little mini-panic this morning,\u201d he admits. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to just go on your phone and just refresh everything to see what\u2019s happening.\u201d </p> <p>It is early morning in Los Angeles, where Hadreas now lives. He is 38, but looks younger; on the screen, he cuts a gentle wary figure, softly spoken, though he grows more wry as the conversation unfolds. </p> <p>Hadreas\u2019s last album, 2017\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/07/perfume-genius-no-shape-review\">No Shape</a></em>, turned him into one of alternative music\u2019s biggest stars. Its grand, melodramatic songs popped up on blockbuster movie trailers, while his witty, arty tweets have amassed him almost a million followers.</p> <p>Two years ago, he moved from Tacoma, Washington, a short drive from where he grew up in Seattle, to LA, with his long-term boyfriend and collaborator Alan Wyffels. (Hadreas has been with Wyffels, a classically trained musician, for 11 years; they are in each other\u2019s company \u201c24 hours a day\u201d, and they have played every Perfume Genius show together.) Then, last summer, Hadreas collaborated with the choreographer Kate Wallich and the YC Dance Company on a dance piece called <em><a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/perfume-genius-becomes-a-dancer-brings-his-universe-to-life-the-sun-still-burns-here-review/\">The Sun Still Burns Here</a></em>, which they performed in New York. It made him realise he was looking for connection, that making music did not have to be so solitary. \u201cDance blew up so much for me,\u201d he says. \u201c[I started] really craving community, and being able to be present in the real world.\u201d</p> <p>Hence the title of the record he wrote shortly after it. <em>Set My Heart on Fire Immediately</em> is a demanding, grabby statement. \u201cBecause I get greedy,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI get a little of this good feeling and I\u2019m like, well, I want to constantly be in that state.\u201d For someone who has been used to having just two feelings, this is a confusing shift. \u201cIt feels really unhinged. If I don\u2019t get it, I\u2019m pissed! I\u2019m constantly waiting and searching for and demanding a big feeling.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ln4S83JeY2Y\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ln4S83JeY2Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=24&amp;v=ln4S83JeY2Y\">Watch the video for Perfume Genius\u2019s On the Floor.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>When the new record was sent out to critics, it came with an essay written by the author of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/14/on-earth-we-are-briefly-gorgeous-ocean-vuong-review\">On Earth We\u2019re Briefly Gorgeous</a></em>, Ocean Vuong, in which he notes that in Hadreas\u2019s most recent work, \u201cthe body (queer, healing, troubled, wounded, possible and gorgeous) sings itself into its future\u201d. Hadreas has often sung about his body, but says that now, he feels more in control of it, more inside it. \u201cI\u2019m always obsessed with this idea of leaving, and changing and shifting, and just blowing everything up and going. Before, I felt like I couldn\u2019t be in my body and do that, but I\u2019m starting to realise that I can.\u201d</p> <p>Has he always had a tendency to want to blow things up and leave? \u201cOh <em>yeah</em>,\u201d he says. \u201cI figured out when I was pretty young that drinking and going out and doing drugs and stuff will just give you a really full, 360-degree feeling. It is ultimately empty, but at least there is enough in the effect that you feel quiet and satiated for a long time. It comes with its own set of really horrible shit, too. It\u2019s kind of a death wish, in a way.\u201d</p> <p>Hadreas only started writing songs when he got clean in his mid-20s, after he dropped out of art school and eventually moved home, and has been sober ever since. Until recently, he says, he would hide from the world when he wasn\u2019t working, and nest at home with Wyffels, stop feeling so \u201cwild\u201d. \u201cI stopped looking for big \u2018feeling\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cBut now I\u2019m starting to realise that maybe there\u2019s another way. I can have more, and keep everything.\u201d Is that liberating? \u201cI feel free, but I also feel that I have no idea what\u2019s going on. Internally, externally. It doesn\u2019t help that the whole world doesn\u2019t, either. It\u2019s in the air, too.\u201d</p> <p>On the sleeve of the new album, Hadreas is topless and muscular, covered in dirt. On previous albums, he has been androgynous, feminine, in makeup and heels; in the videos released so far, he embraces an ultra-macho look. \u201cI wanted the cover [of <em>Set Fire\u2026</em>] and the video to have that same thing, where it\u2019s warm and nostalgic, but something\u2019s not quite right. It\u2019s hyper-masculine, but there\u2019s something off about it.</p> <p>\u201cMy presentation, and what I wear, there\u2019s definitely a performative element to it and I love that. But also, at the core of it, is that it\u2019s just what I feel like doing, and where I am at the moment.\u201d This matches the music, which dips in and out of 50s ballads, 80s pop and theatrical, lilting Americana. </p> <p>Hadreas has always sung about sex, and has never been one for coyness. A new song, Jason, recalls an encounter with a man who doesn\u2019t bother taking his clothes off (\u201cThat\u2019s one of the only songs that is really just a memory that I mined, and I told the story\u201d). On one of his best-known songs, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7OSSUwPVM4\">Queen</a>, he sings about sexuality as a menace to straight society: \u201cNo family is safe, when I sashay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c[Sex] is an easy place to funnel a lot of things that I can\u2019t explain into something that\u2019s very physical,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s much easier to put a beat on a song if it\u2019s about sex. Even when I dance, it all comes from a low place,\u201d he laughs, and gestures down. \u201cI think that\u2019s just the funnel.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac5fe76e33db5181ef0c2f294d3e8b98774f36f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac5fe76e33db5181ef0c2f294d3e8b98774f36f3/0_87_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Performing live at the 2018 Coachella festival in Indio, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Performing live at the 2018 Coachella festival in Indio, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rich Fury/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When he was a teenager in the 1990s, Hadreas loved female musicians who sang about sex frankly. \u201cLiz Phair was just straight up saying some <em>nasty</em> shit to me, that was so empowering. When I first heard it, I was like...\u201d He puts his hand to his mouth in mock fright. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you could say that.\u201d He loved Alanis Morissette, whom he considers the mainstream version of Phair. \u201cIt had a little bit of that underneath. My mom listened to it. And I was like, but mom, she\u2019s nasty! That\u2019s what I liked, this angsty nastiness.\u201d</p> <p>That angsty nastiness continued to inspire him. \u201cI think it is part of the reason I\u2019m obsessed with sex as an idea,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a queer person, [sex] is what everyone says is the disgusting part of how you\u2019re feeling. The wrong part, the dirty part. And I was 12. I hadn\u2019t had sex with anyone, but I was told there\u2019s something wrong with me, because of who I would <em>want</em> to have sex with eventually. It becomes such a loneliness and such a source of shame, and you start developing all these feelings around it before you\u2019re even allowed to find out what it truly is!</p> <p>\u201cTo hear people sing about sex, and women specifically singing about sex in an unapologetic way, where the dynamic was that they were on top, that was really revolutionary to me.\u201d</p> <p>I wonder how Hadreas feels about queerness becoming more mainstream in the entertainment world, even to the point of it becoming a commodity. \u201cI mean, I try not to be bitter,\u201d he smiles. \u201cBut if there is a gay award, I want it. If there\u2019s a gay cheque, then write it to me! That\u2019s how I feel.\u201d He says this lightly. \u201cI feel like queer voices are being heard more, because you can just speak out, and put it up online. I also feel like the gates are still closed, in a lot of ways, unless it\u2019s beneficial to everybody to channel some specific, non-threatening version of queerness. But we need that, too. It\u2019s a weird combination of things. People love queerness when it\u2019s just <em>adjacent</em> to it. When someone\u2019s playing with the idea, and not fully inhabiting it. I think it\u2019s too threatening, when people are...\u201d He reaches for a word, but only one will do. \u201cQueer.\u201d</p> <p>As Perfume Genius, Hadreas fully inhabits all of it. Is he making the music that he would have liked to have listened to, when he was a teenager? \u201cYes,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cI love that. I mean, that\u2019s it, for me.\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://store.matadorrecords.com/set-my-heart-on-fire-immediately\">Set My Heart on Fire Immediately is out on Matador on 15 May</a></em></p>",
  "<p><strong>True Spies</strong> (podcast) | <a href=\"https://spyscape.com/podcast/true-spies\">Spyscape</a><br><strong>Floodlines </strong>(podcast) | <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/floodlines/\">The Atlantic</a> </p> <p>My listening habits have changed since the lockdown; my listening tastes, too. I find myself turning to podcasts in the evening, while the other members of my family get into other media: watching telly, making TikToks, building <em>Minecraft</em> mansions, virtually murdering friends and virtually dancing to celebrate. Still, we\u2019re all usually in the same room, so it\u2019s a kind of bonding. We\u2019re physically close, though miles apart in our minds.</p> <p>Anyhow. The podcasts I\u2019ve searched out this week have been complicated and action-packed. Tales of danger and derring-do in an old world, where people saved each other\u2019s lives through more dramatic means than texting funny memes or playing board games via Zoom. (Yes, I know these things can be vital at the moment. I just crave more\u2026 excitement.) The BBC is usually good at this type of show, but I\u2019ve binged most of its podcasts, so I was happy to hear about a new series from <a href=\"https://www.cupandnuzzle.com/\">Cup and Nuzzle</a> called <strong><a href=\"https://spyscape.com/podcast/true-spies\">True Spies</a></strong>.</p> <p>The show has been made for New York spy museum <a href=\"https://spyscape.com/\">Spyscape </a>\u2013 \u201cthe headquarters of all things spy\u201d \u2013 and the series producer is Gemma Newby, whose credits include <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000cn22\">The Ratline</a></em> for the BBC. <em>True Spies</em> has actual spies telling us about what they actually do, concentrating on a different incident each episode. Future programmes will feature undercover CIA officers, KGB double agents and Cambridge Analytica whistleblower <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/29/mindfck-christopher-wylie-targeted-brittany-kaiser-cambridge-analytica-review\">Brittany Kaiser</a>, whom regular <em>Observer</em> readers may recall. The opening show, which came out last week, was about Gad Shimron, an ex-Mossad operative (apparently, they\u2019re not called \u201cagents\u201d \u2013 \u201cit sounds like you work in insurance\u201d sniffed Shimron), and a mad 1970s tale of the rescue of Ethiopian Jewish refugees from Sudan.</p> <p>There was a lot to explain but the podcast, ably narrated by Hayley Atwell, set things up well. After Haile Selassie\u2019s Ethiopian government was overthrown in 1974, the country\u2019s Jewish citizens, known as the Beta Israel, joined the resistance against the military regime. But it eventually became too dangerous for them to remain, so they fled to refugee camps in Sudan. Some Mossad operatives agreed to rescue them. The Mossad boys set up a real diving retreat for real-life tourists (it was very successful, apparently) as a cover, and then smuggled out the refugees, initially by boat and then by plane.</p> <p>This was a gripping adventure, with jeopardy and weirdness and heart-in-the-mouth upsets. However, when a show is anchored by a single interview with a single interviewee, the pace has to be perfect, and just occasionally, Shimron\u2019s story is too complicated and the pace a teensy bit too slow. But the truthful detail is great and <em>True Spies</em> is set to be an exciting series, not least because, at certain points during the show, Atwell asks the listeners: \u201cWhat would you do?\u201d This is encouragement for the listener to check out the <a href=\"https://spyscape.com/\">Spyscape website</a>, where there are various games to assess whether or not you\u2019d make a good spy. Yes, I\u2019ve tried some of them. Apparently I\u2019m too risk-averse. The lockdown has killed my sense of adventure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"616421fc0190a2a57eadad8110f3cb61b73e904d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/616421fc0190a2a57eadad8110f3cb61b73e904d/200_735_3544_3905/908.jpg\" alt=\"Vann R Newkirk II, host of Floodlines.\" width=\"908\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vann R Newkirk II, host of Floodlines.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emily Jan for the Atlantic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another big, scary, real-life show I\u2019ve been enjoying is <strong><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/floodlines/\">Floodlines</a></strong>, from the <em>Atlantic</em>. Although \u201cenjoying\u201d isn\u2019t quite the right word. <em>Floodlines </em>tells the full story of Hurricane Katrina and New Orleans and, God, what a tragedy that story is. From the end of the first episode, one full of dread and tension, we understand that Katrina wasn\u2019t as bad as everyone feared. Although it was severe (as it approached, residents noticed that the animals fled: \u201cNo parrots, no dogs, no cats, no birds,\u201d said one), Katrina was a Category 3 hurricane, not a 5, and its worst force landed east of New Orleans, not directly on the city. But the levees still broke, the water still rose, and the people still died. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/21/us/hurricane-katrina-new-orleans-danziger-bridge-shootings.html\">Some were shot by police</a>.</p> <p>Presented by <em>Atlantic s</em>taff writer Vann R Newkirk II, <em>Floodlines</em> is impeccable, using direct testimony and archive to build to a final, devastating episode, where Newkirk talks to Michael Brown, who was a director of the Bush government\u2019s response to Katrina. Brown\u2019s inability to properly engage and question himself means he is also unable to apologise. True empathy and responsibility prove an adventure too far. He\u2019s physically close, but miles apart in his mind.</p> <h2>Three alternative radio recommendations</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.resonancefm.com/\">Resonance FM\u2019s 18th birthday</a> </strong><em><strong><br></strong></em>Resonance FM, the most determinedly alternative and creative community radio station of them all, has made it to adulthood \u2013 possibly a shock to both itself and its parent, founder Ed Baxter. On Friday, it celebrated its 18th birthday with 48 specially commissioned shows from its impressive list of contributors (including our own Stewart Lee), plus archive sessions from Sleaford Mods and Kate Tempest, and a special gig from the unlikely combo of Led Zep\u2019s John Paul Jones, Rip Rig + Panic\u2019s Steve Noble and Sonic Youth\u2019s Thurston Moore. More power to its weirdness.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://play.acast.com/s/latenightswithiainlee\">The Late Night Alternative With Iain Lee</a> </strong><em><br></em>One of the few truly original call-in shows out there, Lee\u2019s award-winning talkRadio show, which he hosts on weekdays, 10pm-1am, with producer Katherine Boyle, never fails to surprise. It\u2019s rare that it doesn\u2019t make me laugh out loud \u2013 Barry from Watford leading a communal meditation had me howling on Monday \u2013 but it\u2019s also very touching, providing a genuine service for lonely people in lockdown. I have banged on about this show before, but I will continue to do so as long as it remains one of the few places where humour and humanity coexist. Tune in: you never know what will happen.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p07s2912\">Slow Radio</a><br></strong>Eleanor McDowall\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://fieldrecordings.xyz/\">Field Recordings</a></em>, which I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/22/girl-taken-immaculate-deception-review\">reviewed a couple of weeks ago</a>, are the most pure and up-to-date slow radio recordings. But BBC Sounds has a nice back catalogue of slow episodes, made by a producer putting a microphone in a particular place, shutting up and pressing record. This being the BBC, the producers can\u2019t resist a commentary, which can be irritating. But when that stops, you get some lovely, ear-filling almost-silence. The immersive sound of a still place, or \u2013 at least \u2013 a place where humans don\u2019t feel the need to fill the airwaves with talk. As a chatterbox, I love it.</p>",
  "<p>The row between cinema chains and Universal Studios over the digital-only release of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/29/amc-us-cinema-chain-boycott-universal-studios-home-streaming\" title=\"\"><em>Trolls World Tour</em></a> is one of may crises racking the entertainment industry during the coronavirus lockdown. The challenges range from working out how to stage live performances to managing social distancing in queues for rollercoasters. Here are some of the issues they face.</p> <h2>Television</h2> <p>Television is facing two main obstacle: programme supply issues in the short term; and, in the longer run, potentially fundamental changes to how shows are produced. ITV says, despite cuts in programme frequency, it will run out of episodes of <em>Emmerdale</em> at the end of May, and of <em>Coronation Street</em> at the end of June.</p> <p>The almost total shutdown of the UK\u2019s multibillion-pound TV and film production industry could see gaps in schedules for some genres, such as high-profile dramas, of up to two years. Kevin Lygo, ITV\u2019s director of programming, has already flagged likely reruns of <em>Midsomer Murders</em> in its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/30/itv-considers-filming-love-island-in-cornwall-or-cancelling-series\" title=\"\">depleted schedule</a> next year.</p> <p>How productions are made will change too. Live TV audiences may be a thing of the past for some shows. ITV and the BBC have said they will forgo them if necessary for upcoming series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/14/silly-naff-unmissable-the-masked-singer-is-a-truly-terrible-delight\" title=\"\"><em>The Masked Singer</em></a> and <em>Strictly Come Dancing</em>. On-set production will also be altered by social distancing \u2013 there will be no more mass catering or crowded makeup trucks, and the previously unthinkable prospect of stars actually driving themselves to studios and filming locations may become thinkable.</p> <h2>Music</h2> <p>Artists face a number of lean years following the shutdown of the $27bn global live music industry. The streaming revolution has been a boon for music discovery and promotion, but the real money remains in live performance.</p> <p>\u201cA typical artist gets 65% to 75% of their income from live performances,\u201d says Mark Mulligan, analyst at Midia Research. \u201cBut it will take ages for consumer confidence to recover and return in mass numbers to live music. Toilets, ticketing and cloakrooms are all cluster points. What are club venues going to do, those with capacity of 150 to 200 people? They won\u2019t be viable with two-metre social distancing.\u201d</p> <h2>Standup comedy</h2> <p>Standup is an industry built on close-knit audiences in intimate, sometimes cramped, locations. It is a social-distancing nightmare.</p> <p>\u201cStandup has always been in rooms above pubs, or basements: it\u2019s like an underground movement,\u201d says Simon Lupton, a former BBC commissioning editor for comedy and co-founder of Seven Seas Films. \u201cThese are the very venues you wouldn\u2019t want to go to with coronavirus around, but close-proximity environments are where comedy thrives.\u201d</p> <p>Comedy venues are not big moneyspinners; income from food and drink sales tends to be crucial, and decreased footfall is likely to push many to the brink.</p> <p>\u201cI hope we don\u2019t see venue closures, but I suspect it will be inevitable as a lot of these places run on shoestring budgets,\u201d adds Lupton. \u201cThis won\u2019t be the death of comedy: everything is evolving and finding new ways of working. It will take time, but it will survive.\u201d</p> <h2>Theatre</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"236c69411dbeb2a8936c5756d0b65c2a85dd5cd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/236c69411dbeb2a8936c5756d0b65c2a85dd5cd6/0_217_5824_3495/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A closed theatre in London\u2019s West End, with Les Miserables posters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A closed theatre in London\u2019s West End: large, costly productions rely on full houses to keep going.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Will Oliver/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alistair Smith, editor of <em>The Stage</em>, worries that while <a href=\"https://www.thestage.co.uk/opinion/editors-view-the-big-question-is-not-when-theatres-will-reopen-its-how\" title=\"\">the focus has been on when theatres might open,</a> another question has not been given equal billing: how?</p> <p>\u201cLarge communal activities such as theatre are going to be among the last to reopen,\u201d he says. \u201cEven then, it will probably be with some modifications: reduced capacities, temperature-testing on entrance, maybe even smaller casts due to cramped backstage facilities. And I can\u2019t imagine too many people wanting to crush around a theatre bar in the interval.\u201d</p> <p>Reduced capacities could have a knock-on effect on expensive West End productions with high running costs \u2013 they need packed theatres to be economically viable. Lower-budget shows could afford to play to smaller houses. And restrictions might make immersive theatre impossible.</p> <p>Smith adds that social distancing raises myriad questions, such as how audiences will get to their seats, and whether measures taken in theatres will be undermined if people travel to venues on public transport.</p> <h2>Theme parks</h2> <p>Large amusement parks operate as mini-cities: packed with rides, shopping malls, cinemas and restaurants, they face multiple issues in a virus-hit world. Guidelines published last week by Florida\u2019s Orange County \u2013 home to Disney World, Universal Studios and SeaWorld, all of which hope to reopen next month \u2013 make for lengthy reading. They include touchless hand sanitiser stations at all ticketing and entry areas and turnstiles, as well as markers six feet apart in queues. Mobile check-in will be encouraged at hotels, restaurants will have tables 6ft apart and bartenders will sanitise their hands after each order. In cinemas, people will be allowed in parties of up to four, with two seats between each group.</p> <p>But Andy Edge, a former director of Merlin Entertainments, which owns attractions including Thorpe Park and Chessington, wonders what will happen on rides. \u201cHow do you manage seat separation and social separation with families, couples and strangers? Rides rely on effective loading, and a 50% fill will have a major impact on operations. If coronavirus is here to stay, theme parks may have to think about the long-term physical design and production of rides.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>On 25 May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) became law throughout the European Union. Because it\u2019s a regulation rather than a directive, implementation is not left to the discretion of states; it became part of the legal code of every member of the EU, including the UK at the time. In essence, the GDPR is a set of rules designed to give EU citizens more control over their personal data. The drive behind the regulation was the need to bring the historical patchwork of laws and obligations around personal data, privacy and consent across Europe up to speed and make them fit for purpose in a world dominated by surveillance capitalism. On the face of it, the GDPR looks like a formidable legal instrument.</p> <p>At any rate, in the run-up to its implementation, the prospect of it seemed to scare the wits out of companies and organisations large and small. It was a gold mine for legal and data-protection consultants. Even amateurs such as me were often approached by small community groups terrified that their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/24/businesses-resort-to-desperate-emailing-as-gdpr-deadline-looms\">email list</a> would get them into trouble because they hadn\u2019t explicitly asked every individual on it for their approval.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have a powerful legal instrument that is not being brought to bear on the abusers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The GDPR conferred formidable powers on the data protection authorities (DPAs) of EU states, including the power to impose fines of up to 4% of a company\u2019s global revenues. But so far the number of fines levied has been minuscule compared to the scale of the covert data-broking marketplaces that underpin the revenues of social media and other companies. To date, the biggest fines seem to have been handed out by the UK\u2019s DPA: \u00a3183m on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/08/ba-fine-customer-data-breach-british-airways\">British Airways</a> and \u00a399m on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/09/marriott-fined-over-gdpr-breach-ico\">Marriott hotel chain</a>, both for failing to keep customers\u2019 data safe from hackers. But these are exceptions that appear to prove the rule.</p> <p>So we\u2019re faced with a paradox: on the one hand, there\u2019s massive abuse of personal data by a global data-broking industry; on the other, we have a powerful legal instrument that is not being brought to bear on the abusers. How come? Is it because national DPAs are corrupt? Or indolent? Or just plain incompetent? The answer, it seems, is none of the above. They\u2019re simply overwhelmed by the scale of the task \u2013 and lamentably under-resourced for it.</p> <p>This is what emerges from an <a href=\"https://brave.com/dpa-report-2020/\">investigation</a> by the developers of an innovative browser called Brave, which has led to a formal complaint to the European commission. At the root of the problem is a shortage of critical skillsets. Investigating the shady practices of data-trackers installing cookies on your computer via the websites you visit can be a pretty technical task. DPAs therefore need not just lawyers on their payrolls, but knowledgable, forensically minded techies and such people are in high demand these days and don\u2019t come cheap.</p> <p>The Brave investigation finds that half of Europe\u2019s DPAs have only five technical experts or fewer (three \u2013 Austria, Romania and Latvia \u2013 don\u2019t seem to have any at all). Germany, with 29% of all European tech specialists, has the highest percentage, followed by Spain and France with the UK in fourth place (only 3% of the 680 staff at the UK\u2019s Information Commissioner\u2019s Office are tech specialists). But the most worrying deficit of all is in the Irish DPA, which, according to the Brave report, has only 21 tech-enforcement roles. The fact that most of the tech giants have their European HQs in Dublin means that the Irish authority has the heaviest enforcement workload; it\u2019s currently the lead authority for 127 cases and yet its budget is being squeezed by the Irish government.</p> <p>With the exception of Germany, this seems to be par for the European course. The EU\u2019s governments pay lip service to the importance of citizens\u2019 privacy but they\u2019re evidently unwilling to pay to protect it. So we\u2019re left with a powerful but essentially unenforced regulation, which makes a mockery of the rule of law. Therefore, the big question about the GDPR comes down to this: has it turned out to be just an aspiration or is it a law? And if it\u2019s the latter, shouldn\u2019t we be enforcing it?</p> <h2>What I\u2019ve been reading</h2> <p><strong>Field work</strong><br>There\u2019s a fascinating article by PD Smith in <a href=\"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/the-public-and-private-lives-of-albert-einstein-p-d-smith/\">the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/the-public-and-private-lives-of-albert-einstein-p-d-smith/\">TLS</a></em> about the private and public lives of Albert Einstein.

  "<p>Beloved by artists, mystics and hermits, the desert is a place for contemplation and coming face-to-face with oneself; a place to fully detox from the outside world and enjoy the purifying nothingness of a vast, barren, empty space. The desert retreats featured on these pages \u2013 the Glass Pavilion in Granada, Spain, and the Desert Courtyard House, the Desert Nomad House and the Levin Residence, all in Arizona \u2013 are an invitation to do just that.</p> <p>These desert retreats are designed to help their inhabitants feel a sense of peace through connection to nature. Situation and design combine to turn the poetic idea of the idyll into reality.</p> <p>Architects designing homes or retreats in remote locations, whether mountain, coast, lake, forest, river, plains or desert, may choose to evoke the sculptural and make their dwellings stand out against a canvas of land, sea or sky. But sometimes, in the desert, as elsewhere, the dwellings are carefully camouflaged, often at the owner\u2019s behest in order to give nature its due supremacy, and they sometimes recycle earth, gravel or turf from the excavation of their plots. Many use local, natural materials, not only to reduce transportation costs and carbon footprint, but also to provide an organic sense of belonging to the terrain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b757073d2727041fed97a740fa9609327eaaee32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b757073d2727041fed97a740fa9609327eaaee32/0_198_6090_3654/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Desert Nomad House Studio Rick Joy Tucson Mountains Arizona USA 2006\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barren land: Desert Nomad House in Arizona.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Goldberg/Esto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In these unique desert dwellings, the watchword is not abundance but lack, and this lack is embraced by those who want total escape. A stay in the desert is a chance to experience a wilderness that is sometimes brutal \u2013 only the hardiest plants and animals can survive here. Not for the faint-hearted, a desert retreat is the diametric opposite of a cosy rural escape.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These retreats are designed around sleeping, meditating, cloudwatching and, of course, star-gazing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The retreats featured here tap into the desert\u2019s mythic status and possess an enigmatic quality. The vast blankness of the landscape provides an opportunity to practise serious abstraction: it is the perfect backdrop for bold, sculptural forms. Experiencing (and sometimes mitigating) the intense stimuli of desert immersion is the central idea behind many designs. The desert is harsh, and sometimes inhabitants need to withdraw into a protective shell. Interiors in these homes are cocooning, cave-like and cool \u2013 devoid of much fuss. Why bring endless stuff into the desert when the point of being there is to escape it all? These are not retreats for long stays, but are designed around sleeping, resting, meditating, cloud-watching and, of course, star-gazing.</p> <p>With scant resources, desert retreats must be sustainable, using solar power and passive heating and cooling, and the remoteness of some locations means that prefabrication is essential. Aesthetic intentions range from careful camouflage to experiments in industrial homage.</p> <p>Positioned to capture poetic moments \u2013 the way a mountainside reddens as the evening sun slides over it, or the first rays of dawn \u2013 many retreats here function as viewing apertures. The invitation is to arrive, switch off all distraction, and simply be, allowing your gaze to wander unchecked over the sublime emptiness.</p> <p><em>Living on Vacation: Contemporary Houses For Tranquil Living </em><em>is published by Phaidon at \u00a329.95.

It will be the only emergency loan programme to come with a standard interest rate, after an initial 12-month interest and payment-free period.</p> \n<p> It is also the only programme to come with a 100% guarantee, which means the government will cover the bank\u2019s losses if a customer defaults on their loan. The other schemes are covered up to 80%. Businesses will be able to apply through a short online form, meant to speed up the pace of approvals.</p> \n<p>Lenders have been accused of failing to distribute funds fast enough in recent weeks, with figures showing they approved less than 50% of the 52,807 applications for the existing coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS).</p> \n<p>Stephen Jones, chief executive of the banking lobby group UK Finance, said bank staff were \u201cworking incredibly hard to get money to those viable businesses that need it\u201d, and that lenders were working at pace to get the new scheme up and running.</p> \n<p>Some banks feared the fast-track application for BBLS would mean having to cut corners on affordability checks that would put them in breach of the Consumer Credit Act.

The government has been paralysed by a months-long political dispute over who won last year\u2019s presidential election, which prompted the US to withhold a billion dollars of funding, vital to the functioning of a country with little tax base.</p> <p>US President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to sign a withdrawal deal with the Taliban, in a bid to end America\u2019s long war, has thrust the civil conflict between Afghan factions into an uncertain new phase.

There have been 24 cases confirmed already, but hospitals were unprepared, he claimed, after funds were siphoned off by corruption.</p> <p>\u201cIn terms of equipment, we have zero of that, nothing.

It has an incredible capacity for self-reinvention\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now that the coronavirus is here, Lewis has further predictions. He says that financial speculators will be looking to the White House for tips to exploit the economic crisis that the pandemic has unleashed.</p> <p>\u201cGiven what we know about Trump and his network of cronies,\u201d he says, \u201cyou just wonder how many of them are out there with some advanced notice of what he\u2019s going to say, and are taking advantage of it.\u201d</p> <p>While he may not be overly concerned with the complexities of good governance, Trump has maintained a firm focus on a much more visible, if volatile, yardstick of success: the US stock market.</p> <p>On 12 February, the main <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/feb/12/european-us-stock-markets-record-highs-coronavirus-fears-stock-markets-business-live\">US stock indexes recorded all-time highs</a>, and the president was a happy man. Less than two weeks later, as Wall Street realised the dimensions of the approaching pandemic, there was a spectacular crash, followed by a series of further reversals. Suddenly, Trump\u2019s chief selling point looked as vulnerable as his hairdo.</p> <p>But every stock market crash is an opportunity for the canny speculator. Lewis\u2019s bestselling book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/mar/27/big-short-inside-doomsday-machine\">The Big Short</a></em>, later turned into an Oscar-winning film, was a classic on the subject. It told the story of the hedge fund managers and traders who bet against the market leading up to the 2007-8 financial crisis. Now, says Lewis, such people will surely be studying Trump\u2019s Twitter account.</p> <p>\u201cThere are bound to be smart hedge funds or high-frequency traders who have figured out how to time the tweets and the market reactions. Trump has the ability to move sectors up and down by recommending a drug or saying that he\u2019s solved the problem between the Saudis and the Russians, and the oil market\u2019s going to recover.</p> <p>\u201cI keep waiting for the story that they found the guy or guys who are doing this,\u201d he says.</p> <p>For all Trump\u2019s many missteps, the political impact of Covid-19 remains far from certain. The US leads the world with over a million cases and more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/29/coronavirus-us-economy-covid-19-donald-trump-live\">60,000 deaths</a>. But has it awoken the American public to their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/sep/27/this-guy-doesnt-know-anything-the-inside-story-of-trumps-shambolic-transition-team\">president\u2019s methodical shortcomings</a>? Or has it simply reinforced the ideological sectarianism that is a feature of a deeply divided country?</p> <p>\u201cIt has been party politicised,\u201d says Lewis, \u201cbut less successfully than anything else that\u2019s come down the pike. You see friction between Trump and Republican governors. You see friction between Trump and Republican legislators. He should\u2019ve had a big spike up in his poll numbers. Instead, he\u2019s drifting down.\u201d</p> <p>Liberal critics have come to realise that challenging Trump often serves only to rally his supporters. But, in recent weeks, tactical circumspection has been completely abandoned. In a piece in the latest issue of <em>The Atlantic</em>, entitled <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/underlying-conditions/610261/\">We Are Living in a Failed State</a>, the respected commentator George Packer writes: \u201cThe crisis demanded a response that was swift, rational and collective. The United States reacted instead like Pakistan or Belarus \u2014 like a country with shoddy infrastructure and a dysfunctional government whose leaders were too corrupt or stupid to head off mass suffering.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a5a523bc32668034b24e3ceaabbce128307af6c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5a523bc32668034b24e3ceaabbce128307af6c6/0_0_3500_2339/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Trump talks with Reuters in interview at the White House in Washington\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I think Trump\u2019s figuring out in his reptilian brain that he actually has to solve a problem.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Barr\u00eda/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The nature of that shoddiness and dysfunction was the issue that Lewis explored in <em>The Fifth Risk</em>, his coruscating expos\u00e9 of the depletion of US government agencies by the Trump administration. The book, published in 2018, sought to educate Americans in the many vital roles the much-pilloried federal bureaucracy performs \u2013 from maintaining nuclear waste to assembling the data for weather forecasts.</p> <p>Nowhere was ignorance of these responsibilities quite as glaring as within the Trump camp when it walked into the White House. The presidential team had next to no interest in studying the outgoing Obama administration\u2019s painstaking transition documents.</p> <p>And ever since, Trump has displayed a barely concealed indifference to the government he is supposed to lead, either leaving key posts vacant or appointing ill-suited hangers-on or business people with obvious conflicts of interest to head up different departments, agencies and regulatory bodies.</p> <p>It\u2019s a laissez-faire attitude that has left him ill-prepared to mobilise a coordinated national response to Covid-19. Lewis rates Trump\u2019s performance at the outset of the pandemic as \u201cappallingly bad\u201d, not least because he had already dismantled a programme called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/trump-scrapped-pandemic-early-warning-program-system-before-coronavirus\">Predict </a>that was designed to anticipate the movement of viruses around the world.</p> <p>\u201cBut the big thing he did,\u201d Lewis adds, \u201cwas to remove the pandemic response team from the White House. So he cost us time in the beginning, and time is lives. He cost us much more time than an ordinarily inept man would\u2019ve cost us because, in addition to being inept, he dug his heels in and pretended for weeks that he wasn\u2019t inept. And those weeks were expensive.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s downplaying or outright denial of the Covid-19 threat is well-documented. From mid-January to mid-March, he seemed to view it as something that could be talked away, as though it would disappear through the sheer force of his bluster. Since then he has been forced by events to change tack. The strategic line, though, has been rather muddled: one moment he emphasises the need to support the lockdown, the next he encourages protesters to reject individual state restrictions.</p> <p>\u201cHe should be speaking for the whole country and he\u2019s not,\u201d says Lewis, \u201cbut having said that, he hasn\u2019t been as hostile to science as he might have been.\u201d</p> <p>By this, Lewis means that Trump has largely stood by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/20/fauci-coronavirus-covid-19-stay-home\">Anthony Fauci</a>, the key member of the White House coronavirus task force, whom Lewis calls \u201cthe most popular man in America\u201d. The celebrated immunologist has certainly spearheaded a much-needed revival of expertise, but nonetheless Trump\u2019s newfound support for science is not an obvious improvement on his previous hostility. After all, the cause of empirical research was hardly advanced by his suggestion that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/24/first-thing-the-drugs-dont-work-nor-does-injecting-disinfectant-covid-19\">injecting disinfectant</a> could be the answer to the pathogen.</p> <p>Lewis concedes the point, yet sees signs that Trump, or those around him, are trying to scramble together a functioning operation to deal with the pandemic, if only because there is now no alternative.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to watch,\u201d Lewis says, \u201cbecause I think he\u2019s figuring out in his reptilian brain that he actually has to solve a problem, rather than just let it all happen and then make up a story after the fact.\u201d</p> <p>The problem for Trump, whose speciality is presidential edict by tweet, is that he\u2019s never had much respect for policy and planning. The degradation of federal planning and infrastructure is not a new development. It extends back to Ronald Reagan\u2019s day, but Trump has rapidly accelerated the process. He is, says Lewis, \u201cthe last station on the Reagan Express\u201d.</p> <p>An illustrative example of his approach to government was his appointment of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/13/rick-perry-department-of-energy-trump-administration\">Rick Perry as the head of Department of Energy</a> \u2013 a huge bureaucracy that, among other things, is responsible for nuclear weapons and waste. Perry\u2019s main claim to relevance was that, as an unimpressive presidential candidate, he promised to close down the Department of Energy, without actually knowing what it did.</p> <p>Trump also unsuccessfully sought to install Barry Myers, CEO of AccuWeather, as head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees the National Weather Service (NWS). At AccuWeather, which his family owns, Myers had lobbied to undermine the NWS.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite as cynical as Trump auctioning off the government to business interests,\u201d cautions Lewis. \u201cIt\u2018s more that he had no interest whatsoever himself, paid no attention to it, and so he had no positive motivation to put the right people into the various positions. Who then comes rushing in? The people who have a financial interest.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The  US reacted [to the pandemic] like a country whose leaders were too corrupt or stupid to head off mass suffering.</p> <footer> <cite>Michael Lewis</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Such behaviour has led Lewis to conclude that Trump never expected to become president. The campaign was just a brand-building exercise. \u201cHe\u2019s the dog who caught the car,\u201d he says. But if that were the case, wouldn\u2019t he welcome the release of electoral defeat in November?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing he\u2019s worried about going to jail if he doesn\u2019t control the White House,\u201d Lewis says.</p> <p>What\u2019s clear is that Trump has confounded, not to say dumbfounded, many experienced observers. At the outset, the received wisdom was that the established processes of the American political system, and the sheer weight of responsibility, would force the maverick to conform to presidential expectations.</p> <p>Not only has that not proven the case, but Trump has redefined the whole concept of presidential politics. The fact that no one knows what he\u2019s going to do next, least of all his advisers, has become the means by which the White House operates.</p> <p>\u201cThe model I have in my head right now for our society is the model of a family with kind of a psycho, alcoholic dad,\u201d says Lewis. \u201cIt is the story of how the country compensated for its president, which is a really bizarre story to tell about an American crisis. If you go back in history, it\u2019s usually a president who in some ways leads the response. In this case, he is being dragged along.\u201d</p> <p>But being forced in the direction he never wanted to go is not a role that a man of Trump\u2019s outsized ego will readily accept. He knows that if he is to avoid being the Neville Chamberlain of the pandemic, he has to wrest control of the narrative.</p> <p>To that end, he has directed fire at China (which does, indeed, have questions to answer) and dog-whistled the growing libertarian revolt. Ultimately, however, he will be judged on the numbers. Not of his favoured Dow Jones index \u2013 though that doesn\u2019t look great at the moment \u2013 but of the death count of Americans.</p> <p>As Lewis puts it: \u201cIf this pandemic does not wake Americans up to the importance of good government, then nothing will.\u201d</p> <p><em>Michael Lewis is the author of The Fifth Risk, published by Penguin.

  "<p>Yesterday morning I spent an hour doing a jigsaw puzzle, followed by a game of Scrabble, fortified by tea and scones. For once, there was no one I had to see and nowhere I had to be. The way we live now has split us in two. For introverts, it\u2019s largely business as usual. But for my more extroverted friends, who are clamouring for Zoom calls to fill the gaping hole the pub has left in their lives, it\u2019s a deeply testing time.</p> <p>I\u2019m an introvert, which means I need time alone to recharge. This doesn\u2019t mean I hate socialising, but it may well mean I will feel stressed and fatigued if I\u2019m not left on my own for a while afterwards.</p> <p>On the flipside, extroverts are energised by time spent with other people and are often, though not always, more outgoing. In the 1960s the German psychologist Hans Eysenck suggested the reason behind this difference lies in our environmental sensitivity. Introverts need lower levels of stimulation to reach their \u201cset point\u201d of social arousal than extroverts, leading them to seek an escape into quiet solitude sooner.</p> <p>So it makes sense that we introverts are finding lockdown easier than our extroverted counterparts. They are struggling to reverse their behaviour, which I sympathise with \u2013 I can\u2019t imagine what it would feel like to suddenly have to live life the other way round, with the government forcing me to socialise relentlessly. The thought of having to meet and talk to new people day and night without the possibility of withdrawing alone to recharge my batteries makes me feel nauseous.</p> <p>Natasha Tiwari, a psychologist with a practice in London, agrees that self-isolation plays to an introvert\u2019s strengths, but notes the importance of recognising that introversion and extroversion exist on a fluid scale. It\u2019s natural to find things tough, however you identify. \u201cIntroversion and extroversion are not binary concepts,\u201d she says. \u201cMany of us flick between them depending on our mood, environment and the people surrounding us. The key is to work out how to attain the right balance in your lifestyle to support your mental health.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For once, there is no guilt about wanting to stay at home</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In his 2011 paper on introversion, the American psychologist Jonathan Cheek argued that there are four main types of introvert: anxious, restrained, thinking and social \u2013 though overlap is normal. Anxious introverts struggle with shyness, often avoiding other people. Restrained introverts can enjoy socialising, but will stay in their shell until they feel comfortable. Thinking introverts are happy around others but are prone to daydreaming, and social introverts enjoy meeting friends but prefer to do so in intimate groups.</p> <p>I fall mostly into the last camp and always have done. I socialise one-on-one where possible. I relish a deep and meaningful conversation, but find the small-talk element of big gatherings tedious. You\u2019ll find me on the dancefloor, but I won\u2019t be asking 20 different people, \u201cHow\u2019s work?\u201d Being a social introvert means I am missing the injections of real-life connection that I carefully thread through my diary every few days. Technology isn\u2019t quite doing it for me; it feels too frenetic.</p> <p><em><strong>I\u2019m living with</strong></em> my extroverted mum who has been enjoying regular \u201cprosecco hours\u201d on Zoom, the soundtrack to which goes like this: \u201cWhere are you? Turn your camera on! Oh, there you are! Cheers darling! Oh, you\u2019ve gone again! Unmute! Unmute!\u201d</p> <p>I downloaded the Houseparty app, opened it up and immediately a friend\u2019s face popped up to say hi, entirely unannounced. The horror has stayed with me.</p> <p>Cat Archer Underwood, 36, a brand consultant from Hampshire and an introvert, is learning more about herself. \u201cI\u2019ve had moments of utter peace, watching my husband and four-year-old daughter pottering about in the garden,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I have been surprised at how I am feeling about the prospect of more weeks of this. I am dreaming of hosting barbecues, having a house full of laughing children and seeing people who aren\u2019t quite friends but are more than strangers. I may be choosier about the events I force upon myself in the future, but I\u2019ve learned that this introvert needs to party sometimes, too.\u201d</p> <p>Others further along the introversion scale are finding their daily life has barely changed. English teacher Ellie Grout, 29, from Bristol, is one of them. \u201cSelf-isolation is similar to my normal experience,\u201d she says. \u201cThe difference is that, for once, there is no pressure to arrange social events and no guilt about cancelling plans when I realise I want to stay at home.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Introverts like to have their own space to process their ideas</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hardcore introvert <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jessica-pan\" title=\"\">Jessica Pan</a>, 34, spent a year living like an extrovert while writing her 2019 book, <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sorry-Late-Didnt-Want-Come/dp/0857526154\" title=\"\">Sorry I\u2019m Late, I Didn\u2019t Want to Come</a></em>. She lives with her husband Ian, a \u201csolid ambivert\u201d. Both are working from home and appreciating the slower pace of lockdown life. \u201cI don\u2019t believe any introvert actively enjoys being locked in their home at this time of anxiety,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I am finding pleasure in the small things, such as reading more, cooking slowly and doing pilates. I\u2019m trying to embrace this new normal and live in the moment.\u201d</p> <p>Jemma Broadstock, 24, a virtual assistant from Derbyshire, is hopeful this lockdown will reveal the often overlooked strengths of introverts and help erode what Susan Cain, author of the 2012 bestseller <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/22/quiet-power-introverts-susan-cain-review\" title=\"\">Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can\u2019t Stop Talking</a></em>, dubs \u201cthe extroverted ideal\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBusiness is thriving for me,\u201d she says. \u201cThe idea of networking events has always felt overwhelming, but now people are holding them online and I\u2019ve been finding new clients. When everything goes back to normal, I hope employers will offer more remote-working opportunities, as I feel much more confident in my own space. I am able to make valuable input when I would normally stay quiet.\u201d</p> <p>Cain, a former Wall Street lawyer, went some way in challenging misconceptions that introverts are always shy, serious and aloof with nothing much to offer. In her book she extols \u201cthe man of contemplation\u201d in a society that has \u201calways favoured the man of action\u201d. Yet nearly a decade after its publication, extroversion is still considered a model of success, especially in the workplace where what Cain describes as \u201cthe omnipresent belief that the ideal self is gregarious, alpha and comfortable in the spotlight\u201d prevails.</p> <p>Working in an open-plan office, taking part in daily meetings, public speaking and networking are all activities that are geared towards the extrovert\u2019s need for stimulation, while introverts struggle to make themselves seen and maintain their energy reserves.</p> <p><em><strong>Our response to</strong></em> the coronavirus pandemic means that society has changed overnight, reshaped to suit a more introverted way of being \u2013 one that is rarely permitted \u2013 of thriving in a quiet setting, having time to think and be creative, and having control over how much socialising you do. No social experiment could have gone this far in modelling a way of living designed almost exclusively for introverts. It may just show employers that, as Cain says in her 2012 Ted talk, \u201cwhen it comes to creativity and leadership, we need introverts doing what they do best.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I mean zero. We could all stand to unplug and get inside our own heads a little more often.\u201d</p> <p>Tiwari hopes that this episode of upheaval will cause a long-term shift in working culture that could not come soon enough for introverts. \u201cIntroverts often enjoy having their own space to process ideas and work undistracted,\u201d she says. \u201cThe lockdown is proving that working from home and being in one\u2019s own space is not to the detriment of wider business interests and can, in fact, lead to a boost in productivity and wellbeing.\u201d</p> <p>Tiwari believes that extroverts and introverts can cope with this strange time together, so long as they respect their differences. \u201cBeing one or the other doesn\u2019t preclude you from sharing interests and being cosy together,\u201d she says. \u201cIt just means that you may need to be extra conscious of each other\u2019s needs. Extroverts may be surprised at how much they enjoy this quieter time, while introverts may find themselves craving the company of others. Don\u2019t overthink how you label yourself. Follow your intuitive sense for what you need right now.\u201d</p>",

After weeks of silence, the presumptive Democratic nominee categorically denied the accusation in a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-7a9593bd3012\">Medium post</a> and in an interview on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe.</p> <p>\u201cThis never happened, and when she first made the claim, we made it clear that it never happened, and it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d the former vice-president said on Morning Joe.</p> <p>But, of course, it isn\u2019t as simple as that. While it\u2019s commendable that Biden finally addressed Reade\u2019s allegations directly, instead of having his campaign issue more denials, he needs to go further. Biden must authorize a search of his Senate papers, which are held at the University of Delaware, to identify any evidence of the complaint that Reade says she made about him at the time.</p> <p>Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski repeatedly asked Biden if he would authorize such a search; his answer was \u201cno.\u201d Biden said that he would ask the National Archives to make public any record of a complaint filed by Reade, but would not allow his Senate papers to be unsealed as they \u201cdo not contain personnel files\u201d and could become political \u201cfodder\u201d.</p> <p>That\u2019s not good enough. Surely Biden can order an independent investigation of his Senate papers for mentions of Reade without compromising other sensitive information? If he\u2019s not capable of doing that then I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s capable of being the president of the United States.</p> <p>But what about the current president? What about the pussy-grabber in chief? What about the dozens of sexual harassment allegations against him? Why should Biden be held to a higher standard than Donald Trump?</p> <p>There has been a huge amount of whataboutism by liberals when it comes to the allegations against Biden. I can understand the frustration fueling this: the fact that Trump supporters are suddenly concerned about sexual consent is jaw-droppingly hypocritical.</p> <p>The White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, for example, seems to have suddenly become a massive #MeToo advocate. \u201c\u2018Believe all women\u2019 means <em>all</em> women,\u201d Conway <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/kellyanne-conway-joe-biden-accuser-believe-women\">told Fox News on Friday</a>. \u201cLet\u2019s not pretend Joe Biden doesn\u2019t have a history of, without permission, and without restraint, planting his face in the back of women\u2019s heads, sniffing their hair, fondling their necks and creeping them out,\u201d Conway <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CillizzaCNN/status/1256245211392606208?s=20\">further noted</a>. Hang on, does this woman know who she works for? Does she have any shame at all?</p> <p>But it\u2019s not just Trump supporters who are being hypocritical. Conservatives have rightly <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/495502-pelosi-tells-reporter-she-doesnt-need-a-lecture-on-biden-kavanaugh-comparison\">pointed out</a> the difference in the way Democrats and the mainstream media treated the sexual assault allegations against supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh versus the allegations against Biden. There is arguably a lot more evidence supporting the allegations against Biden than there ever was against Kavanaugh, but there\u2019s a hell of a lot less liberal outrage. When confronted with a question about those double standards on Thursday, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/495502-pelosi-tells-reporter-she-doesnt-need-a-lecture-on-biden-kavanaugh-comparison\">Nancy Pelosi responded</a> by saying that she didn\u2019t need a \u201clecture or a speech\u201d and \u201cJoe Biden is Joe Biden\u201d. An extremely persuasive retort.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure that the allegations against Biden will end up doing any serious damage to his campaign. However, the way in which the Democratic party and liberals have rallied behind him is going to do a huge amount of damage to #MeToo. Alyssa Milano, the woman who helped mainstream #MeToo, choosing to believe Biden over Reade will be brought up every single time someone says \u201cbelieve women\u201d. The way in which liberals downplayed allegations against Biden will be used as ammunition every single time someone on the right is accused of sexual assault.</p> <p>Indeed, Trump is already using the Democrats\u2019 defense of Biden to discredit his own accusers. When asked about the Reade allegations by reporters on Thursday he mused that Biden that might have been <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/495563-trump-biden-allegations-could-be-false-but-he-should-respond\">falsely accused</a>. \u201cIt could be false accusations. I know all about false accusations,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been falsely charged numerous times, and there is such a thing.\u201d Trump then went on to speak about Kavanaugh, saying: \u201cHe was falsely charged. What happened with him was an absolute disgrace to our country.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s an absolute disgrace to America: the fact that, in November, women will be forced to choose between two men credibly accused of sexual assault for president.</p> <h2><strong>New Zealand safety net helps sex workers in lockdown</strong></h2> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2003/0028/latest/DLM197815.html\">New Zealand Prostitution Reform Act</a>, developed with the input of sex workers, decriminalized sex work in 2003.

  "<p>One unexpected side effect of the current pandemic has been a plummet in the appeal of alien-related fiction. When our lives and those of our beloved are threatened by submicroscopic killers, the idea of extraterrestrial body snatchers, triffids or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/25/ridley-scott-no-xenomorphs-prometheus-2-alien\">xenomorphs</a> \u2013 yes, even the allegorical ones \u2013 seems extraneous.

Similarly, here you command a tight squadron of combatants, directing their movements from a bird\u2019s eye perspective above various fields of play. You take turns with an unseen alien commander to move your units from cover to cover, coordinating attacks, feints and retreats in a series of drawn-out but often exhilarating skirmishes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Clearing a mission without losing a soldier is immensely satisfying</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Each individual in your team has a class \u2013 sniper, healer, attacker and so on \u2013 a name and a customisable wardrobe. (And, look, if the idea of dressing your units in, say, bright pink armour seems childish, remember that since at least the 12th century, when a craftsperson carved the Lewis chessmen into walrus ivory, bespoke designs for game pieces have been popular.) Each unit, typically, has three \u201caction points\u201d, which can be spent on moving position, reloading weapons, chainsawing through alien limbs, applying first aid or setting up \u201coverwatch\u201d mode, whereby they cover a sector, firing their gun if anything crosses their line of sight.</p> <p><em>Gears Tactics</em> offers tremendous freedom to its armchair general: you can switch between units before you\u2019ve spent all of their designated points, and in this way build a uniquely individual response to every tactical situation. Missions evolve in ways that demand flexibility, too. Sink holes will open up, capriciously, then spew forth enemies, turn by turn, until you manage to throw a grenade into the opening to close up the ground. Alien reinforcements are dropped from passing transports, rendering a position previously considered safe comprehensively flanked.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XwN1s4xkTQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2XwN1s4xkTQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XwN1s4xkTQ\">Watch a trailer for Gears Tactics</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>You must adapt to these changes in circumstance with care and caution. A unit that is left alone is vulnerable. Yet risk-taking is often rewarded, especially when attempting to complete the mission\u2019s optional objectives, which earn rare pieces of armour or stat-improving attachments for your weapons.</p> <p>Clearing a mission without losing a soldier is immensely satisfying, a feeling compounded by the fact that each individual on your team earns experience points for their performance, unlocking new skills and abilities that, over the course of the campaign, represent the cumulative fruits of your journey. It\u2019s as if you had the ability to upgrade your chess pieces across multiple matches: a victory against a Kasparov might enable you to fit one of your pawns with a helmet that enabled them to evade a lunge from an attacking rook. As your tactical nous improves through experience, so your units advance materially. The better your performance, the greater the chance of future success.</p> <p>Along with the obvious benefits to the design comes one drawback: the question of balance. There is a purity to chess, Go and other traditional tactical board games that is lost when past performance dictates future capabilities. Still, it\u2019s an inevitable side effect in a game with an overarching storythat keeps pleasingly in step with one\u2019s progress.</p> <p>That story shares its themes of comradeship, loyalty and the mortal need for togetherness in the crucible of combat with much military-themed fiction, but here it\u2019s lightened by the fact your opponents are drooling aliens and not, say, lurking insurgents. A game that, for all its sci-fi excess, delivers a delightfully tuned tactical arena.</p> <h2><strong>Retro choice: if you like Gears Tactics, you\u2019ll love\u2026</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4a5b4b11c3cebbd551004d1eee2bc64e279c01c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4a5b4b11c3cebbd551004d1eee2bc64e279c01c/79_89_709_425/500.jpg\" alt=\"Final Fantasy Tactics.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018As beguiling as ever\u2019: Final Fantasy Tactics.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Final Fantasy Tactics<br></strong><em>(Square-Enix; PlayStation, iOS)<br></em>It\u2019s testament to the coherence of its fantastical world, strategic depths and refined storytelling that, almost 25 years after the game\u2019s original release, <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> remains as beguiling as ever. Unlike <em>Gears Tactics</em>, battles take place on a uniform grid, lending the strategy a more straightforwardly board game-like feel. But the ability to change each character\u2019s class, while carrying over previously learned abilities, opens up strategic depths that have, arguably, yet to be matched.</p> <p>Unexpectedly, this tinkering is couched in an unusually compelling and, at times, even affecting story of knights, castles and political and religious intrigue. Each unit becomes more than a pawn as you come to care for their plight, not only in the moment-by-moment thrust of battle, but also the sweeping arc of their fleeting lives.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Will Woodward, head of sport</strong></h2> <p>Sport\u2019s unravelling happened haphazardly \u2013 and then suddenly. With Champions League and Europa League games behind played behind closed doors or postponed, and plenty of debate about whether other sports should continue, the turning point was Arsenal\u2019s head coach <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/12/mikel-arteta-tests-positive-coronavirus-arsenal-head-coach-premier-league\">Mikel Arteta\u2019s diagnosis with coronavirus</a>, which popped up on Thursday 12 March, a few hours after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-johnson-warns-many-more-families-are-going-to-lose-loved-ones-video\">Boris Johnson had warned that many families would lose their loved ones</a>.

That day the Premier League, Women\u2019s Super League, Scottish Premier League, London Marathon and England\u2019s Test series with Sri Lanka all went. Somehow that day\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/al-boum-photo-wins-cheltenham-gold-cup-horse-racing-festival\">Gold Cup at Cheltenham</a> went ahead, seeming even then to misread the mood \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/21/experts-inquiry-cheltenham-festival-coronavirus-deaths\">it does even more so now</a>.</p> <p>\u201cSport was actually quite good wasn\u2019t it,\u201d tweeted our chief sportswriter, Barney Ronay. After a spell in which the ground shifted beneath our feet almost daily, we\u2019ve settled into some kind of routine. Inevitably we\u2019re covering a lot about postponements, cancellations and hopes for restarts. Our reporter David Conn was quickly on to fears that the virus had spread <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/22/liverpool-atletico-madrid-coronavirus-champions-league\">after the Liverpool-Atl\u00e9tico Madrid</a> game, and the Guardian has looked hard at evidence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/21/experts-inquiry-cheltenham-festival-coronavirus-deaths\">linking the virus to Cheltenham</a>. Otherwise we\u2019ve had time to wallow \u2013 not too much, but enough \u2013 in some of the great moments of the past, not least in our retro <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/apr/18/chile-v-italy-1962-world-cup-live\">minute-by-minute series</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/my-favourite-game\">My Favourite Game series</a>.

Sport isn\u2019t even close to the most important thing right now. But do we miss it? Like crazy.<br></p> <h2>Jonathan Liew, sports writer</h2> <p>It\u2019s like a metaphysical conundrum: how do you write about sport that doesn\u2019t exist? In a way, it\u2019s analogous to describing the silence that follows a piece of music: yes, technically you\u2019re trying to define the shape of something that isn\u2019t there. But if you listen closely enough, you can feel in the absence the weight of what was once present. And perhaps it\u2019s only in the void that sport leaves that you can truly appreciate its worth.<br><br>How do you fill the void? Archive features and retrospectives are perhaps an inevitable upshot of the shutdown, a chance to reconsider the past with a fresh eye and the benefit of time. But our readers don\u2019t simply want to wallow in nostalgia; they want to know when sport will return, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/20/with-sport-frozen-in-time-we-need-to-find-joy-in-the-journey-not-the-destination\">what it will feel and taste like when it does</a>. That\u2019s the balance I\u2019ve tried to strike, and in a way it\u2019s the balance we\u2019re all striving for: equal parts realism and escapism, the same bewitching brew that drew us all to sport in the first place.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5b407f12788bfd01ced6ea8ccd8f816fda4d393\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5b407f12788bfd01ced6ea8ccd8f816fda4d393/0_46_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cardboard cutouts replace supporters at Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach\u2019s stadium in April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cardboard cutouts replace supporters at Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach\u2019s stadium in April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sascha Steinbach/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><br>Claire Tolley, sports features editor</h2> <p>Sports journalism\u2019s rhythm is defined by the diary. But that diary is empty, at least in the immediate future, despite ongoing meetings to provide a roadmap of how and when live sport can return. Global championships, events and league seasons have been cancelled or postponed, falling like a row of dominoes in the past couple of months. And so the first part of lockdown has been shaped by a news agenda chasing what will no longer be happening this spring and summer and the repercussions of those cancellations or delays. That has now been replaced by talk of when live sport might get up and running again, and the ethics of such a return.</p> <p>There has been a glaring hole left in the absence of any live sport to cover. Interviews and features, too, are usually pegged to the news agenda or forthcoming events. Beyond those related to the pandemic itself, we have recast interviews or features to reflect the new reality of lockdown. We have also looked for different ways of engaging with our readers. Our hugely popular live minute-by-minutes have had a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/apr/11/the-masters-1996-greg-norman-final-round-live\">retro makeover</a>, some pegged to anniversaries or events that had been in the diary; we have brought in regular columnists such as the England cricketer Moeen Ali <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/18/ask-moeen-the-england-all-rounder-answers-guardian-readers-questions\">to answer readers\u2019 questions</a> and commissioned follow-up features off the back of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/12/missing-live-sport-here-are-12-great-documentaries-to-watch-instead\">readers\u2019 responses to articles</a>.</p> <p>As the lockdown continues, and the news ebbs rather than flows, we are embracing opportunities to turn back the clock, source interviews that we could never quite find the right time to publish, and investigate wider issues.<br></p> <h2>Barry Glendenning, sports writer and broadcaster</h2> <p>Before all this, the problems we were most accustomed to dealing with on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/footballweekly\">Guardian\u2019s Football Weekly podcast</a> involved how best to cram in all the big weekend talking points on a Monday morning. All four divisions of the English league had to be discussed, along with the latest news from Scotland and the major continental leagues, as well as any other business. That\u2019s a \u201chella lotta\u201d football chat.</p> <p>Presenter Max Rushden and I immediately promised our audience that, health permitting, we would continue recording twice a week until somebody higher up told us to stop. We hoped it would go some way towards maintaining our own sanity as well as that of the hundreds of thousands of listeners for whom Football Weekly seems to provide a reassuring sense of normality and routine. Our listening figures suggest that if anything, football has been holding us back for years.</p> <p>With no action to discuss, Max and I have had to come up with other ways to fill time. The most difficult part? Finding the right balance between discussions about particularly grim virus-related issues and more frivolous topics of discussion, such as the conspicuous absence of bookshelves full of intellectually weighty tomes in the background of each other\u2019s \u201chome studios\u201d, and general chit-chat about how we\u2019ve been coping in a world where pub-going is not an option. It should go without saying that our guests and listeners have been a source of welcome inspiration, their contributions and correspondence regularly sending us off on strange, often hilarious and always welcome tangents.</p> <p>While Max and I don\u2019t like to talk about the selfless manner in which we are putting our lives on the line each week in the interests of boosting public morale like a pair of modern-day Vera Lynns, we recently received an email from a nurse named David from the United States who could identify with the stress and hardship we are currently not enduring.</p> <p>\u201cYour voices cheerfully ring through the darkness of semi-rural Connecticut during my long drives into my night shift and balance out my thoughts of how many Covid patients my hospital now has, or how many of my co-workers have either tested positive or are now under quarantine,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am sure there are thousands and thousands of people like me around the world that deeply appreciate what you do. Please carry on.\u201d</p> <p>Just try to stop us.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Match reports have to be filed against tight deadlines.

A largely Saudi Arabian-funded consortium was buying the city\u2019s football club for \u00a3300m. Devoid of the usual framework of matches and press conferences \u2013 which provided welcome structure and routine for us \u201cpatch reporters\u201d who routinely work from home \u2013 there was something to write about again.</p> <p>Instead of debating whether teams should be playing 3-4-3 or 4-2-3-1, there is Newcastle United\u2019s extraordinary role in a bitter proxy war between Saudi and Qatar to consider: a Doha-based satellite broadcaster has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/22/bein-sports-asks-premier-league-to-block-saudi-newcastle-deal-over-piracy\">urged the Premier League to block the takeover</a>, arguing that Saudi Arabia should be accountable for a pirate network that illegally transmits English top-tier games.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/15/newcastle-expect-green-light-saudi-takeover-despite-amnesty-misgivings\">Amnesty are rightly concerned</a> about Saudi\u2019s human rights record but Newcastle fans are broadly delighted - and extremely excited - by the prospective departure of the club\u2019s loathed owner, Mike Ashley. It\u2019s an ethical quagmire. Sophisticated sports-washing or Saudi modernisation?</p> <p>Match reporting is infinitely more straightforward \u2013 and adrenaline-rich. Perhaps the biggest thing I crave is the adrenaline: reports invariably have to be filed against tight deadlines, either on the final whistle or, at night games, as \u201crunners\u201d, with chunks of copy delivered at half-time. They always involve a mild sense of panic. I miss that.</p> <p>The Premier League has been hit hard by the crisis \u2013 and the supply of sporting news has almost dried up.</p> <h2>Andy Bull, senior sports writer</h2> <p>Even now, looking back at it from a distance, the speed with which everything changed feels bewildering. On Saturday 7 March, a few weeks and half a lifetime ago, I was at Twickenham, reporting on England\u2019s victory against Wales in the Six Nations, one in a crowd of 80,000. Boris Johnson was there too. Five days later he was on TV telling us that we were in the midst of the \u201cworst public health crisis for a generation\u201d. And then, all of a sudden, someone pulled the rug out from under the summer. The rest of the rugby season was postponed, then the beginning of the cricket season too, and the Masters, the Open, Wimbledon and the Olympics, all events I was supposed to cover.</p> <p>Instead, I\u2019m a sportswriter with no sport to write, apart from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/01/cabin-fever-agenda-for-housebound-olympics\">marble racing videos and back garden marathons</a>. I\u2019ve been craving some escape from it all. Sport\u2019s a glorious triviality, after all. So I\u2019ve been busy losing myself in writing about my favourite old games and players, or reporting on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/mar/28/coe-and-ovetts-olympic-debt-to-bureaucrat-who-defied-thatcher\">forgotten stories about the Moscow Olympic boycott</a> and the CIA\u2019s attempts to recruit Soviet athletes in the 1960s, anything that I think will entertain readers, and give them something else to read and think and talk about, to try to help them forget about everything else, if only for a few precious minutes.</p>",

The first was in the aftermath of Iran\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/21/us/politics/trump-iran-decision.html\">shooting down of a US drone</a> in June 2019; then in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/15/world/middleeast/iran-us-saudi-arabia-attack.html\">September</a>, when Iran stood accused of having attacked Saudi oil infrastructure; and again when the US killed General Suleimani in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/11/us/politics/iran-trump.html\">January</a>, triggering retaliatory Iranian missile strikes in Iraq. The Covid-19 pandemic could have provided a window for a <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/iran/b76-flattening-curve-us-iran-tensions\">humanitarian ceasefire</a>, but instead appears to have become an occasion for displaying a hardening of positions.</p> <p>With neither side willing to yield, a dearth of effective communication channels, stalled diplomacy and a wide arc of regional flashpoints where the US, Iran and their respective allies are tensely poised, a single incident, even if minor, could quickly spin out of control.</p> <p>While the Swiss channel proved effective for conveying high-level messages, it is designed for diplomatic, not military, communication and may not prevent an incident during a standoff between military ships from turning into a shoot-out.

Based on these considerations, Oman would be a particularly strong candidate. It manages security for shipping exiting the Strait of Hormuz into the Gulf of Oman, and as a result has technical acumen and expertise in relaying communications. It has previously facilitated US-Iran communication. And both sides have typically considered it an honest broker. Oman has a military cooperation agreement with the US, and jointly operates a military commission with Iran.</p> <p>In one possible design, a one-star general within US Central Command\u2019s leadership would communicate by telephone with an Omani general maintaining a separate telephone line with a counterpart on the Iranian general staff.</p> <p>Critics of such a mechanism may contend that, owing to high tensions and hostility between Tehran and Washington, establishing a line of contact for operational de-escalation is likely to encounter insurmountable political opposition, and that it may prove ineffectual even if established. But its potential to prevent a catastrophic miscalculation and inadvertent escalation outweighs its costs and risks, even if its remit is limited. Also being modest in scope and ambition, it would not require any significant departure from the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d approach, nor would it entail Iran endorsing a US military presence in the region, which it rejects as a matter of principle.</p> <p>Overcoming obstacles facing any US-Iran channel, even a mediated one, will be difficult, especially given the wider diplomatic impasse and distrust between the two sides.

On the whole, you shouldn\u2019t spoil vegetables with too much fertility, but the opposite is true for cucurbits: the more love the better.

Or train rampant ones in a circle. You will need tent pegs. As the plants start to trail, pin down the stem gently as it grows in a spiral round the plant.

  "<p>In the winter of 2002, nine months before Hanif Qadir unpacked his bag at a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan, a group of men walked into the London MOT testing centre he owned with his brothers. They were collecting money for civilians caught up in the US invasion of Afghanistan; hundreds of children had been orphaned by indiscriminate bombing, the men claimed. Could he help? The appeal resonated with Qadir, who had lost his father when he was seven. He made a donation.</p> <p>The men returned regularly. Each time, they asked for more money, before gradually changing the subject to Qadir\u2019s faith. Eventually they invited him to a meeting at a local house to discuss the war in Afghanistan more freely. \u201cI felt they were sincere and genuine,\u201d Qadir recalls. At the meeting, the men encouraged Qadir to visit websites that claimed to show photographic evidence of violence against Afghan civilians by western troops.</p> <p>Qadir browsed hundreds of distressing images, among them scores of orphans, each accompanied by extended captions that described the way in which the child\u2019s family had been killed. One girl\u2019s story has remained with him. The website claimed she had lost 21 members of her family to a \u201cstray\u201d US missile. The caption explained it had taken locals three days to scrape their remains from the walls of the girl\u2019s home. The more he saw, the closer Qadir became to the men who were, unbeknown to him, recruiters for al-Qaida.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If someone calls for genocide against Muslims, \u2018they\u2019ve essentially tattooed a swastika to their forehead online\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Qadir grew up in Thornaby-on-Tees, a small town in North Yorkshire. After his father died, he had disengaged from school, leaving at 14 and moving to London. After a few odd jobs, he founded a business with his brothers, buying, repairing and selling cars. By the early 2000s, the business was profitable enough that he was able to donate generously to charitable community causes, a reputation that, he believes, led the recruiters to his door.</p> <p>The suggestion that Qadir travel to Afghanistan was seeded gently. \u201cWhen a person is radicalised they become suggestible,\u201d he tells me. \u201cWe discussed that, in order to prevent more loss of life, we needed to be prepared to fight.\u201d On 2 December 2002, he flew to Islamabad in Pakistan. A few days later, he crossed the border into Afghanistan.</p> <p>Soon after he arrived at a training camp, Qadir saw a man measuring up children who lived there. \u201cI thought they were being tailored for new clothes,\u201d he recalls. Then he heard one of the leaders telling the children they would soon be reunited with their dead parents. They were being fitted for suicide vests. \u201cI felt sick and angry,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to walk away.\u201d</p> <p>But in the middle of a desert compound patrolled by armed guards, any attempt to defect could be fatal. Qadir was trapped. \u201cI knew that if I asked to leave things would end badly.\u201d He had to think carefully.</p> <p>***</p> <p>In 2002, when Qadir was being radicalised, the internet was not yet ubiquitous. There was no Twitter, no Facebook; websites looking to groom people into supporting extremist causes were obscure. Two decades later, the digital landscape has been transformed. As the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Hate Crime <a href=\"http://www.appghatecrime.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/APPG%20on%20Hate%20Crime%20Report%20Hate%20Crime%20and%20Community%20Cohesion.pdf\" title=\"\">wrote last year</a>, the internet has become a \u201ckey breeding ground\u201d for extremism and hate speech \u2013 emboldened by the increasing ease of dissemination, anonymity and, thanks to outdated legislation, a lack of meaningful consequences.</p> <p>Perpetrators of terrorist attacks now routinely leave online statements or manifestos to justify their actions, hoping their words might encourage others. The 28-year-old gunman who killed 51 mosque-goers in Christchurch, New Zealand, last year posted a 73-page white nationalist rant to the fringe web forum 8chan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/21/facebook-could-have-moved-faster-on-christchurch-video-if-it-were-suicide\" title=\"\">and livestreamed the attack on Facebook</a>.</p> <p>But now, just as Facebook and Twitter have become the prodigious muck-spreaders of our age, a handful of clandestine startups are using technology to stem the flow. <a href=\"http://moonshotcve.com\" title=\"\">Moonshot,</a> whose office is at a secret location in London, is, at five years old, a veteran in this emerging industry. Its premises have the feel of a typical Silicon Valley operation: distressed floorboards, glass-fronted offices, beanbags by an open fireplace, exposed brickwork, a snug for breathers. There are a few clues that the company\u2019s business \u2013 using technology to disrupt violent extremism \u2013 is different from that of the fitness app developers, social media influencers and virtual reality speculators with whom it shares an aesthetic. The posters are not vintage prints but disquieting infographics revealing, for example, that after 22 people were shot dead in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/el-paso-shooting\" title=\"\">El Paso Walmart</a> last August, there was an 82% rise in the Google search term \u201chow to murder Mexicans\u201d.

Activity that indicates sympathy with a violent movement or ideology (eg Googling \u201cwhite pride worldwide\u201d) earns three points, while showing a desire to join, send money to, or commit acts on behalf of a violent extremist group or individual earns six.</p> <p>Home Office initiatives such as <a href=\"https://www.ltai.info/what-is-prevent/\" title=\"\">Prevent</a> have traditionally focused on training teachers and other leaders to identify people likely to be drawn to violent extremism within their communities \u2013 but these methods risk introducing discriminatory practices. \u201cIn France, for example, there were posters telling people their sons might be at risk of violent extremism if they grow a beard, start speaking Arabic or stop eating baguettes,\u201d explains Ross Frenett, Moonshot\u2019s cofounder. \u201cThat is obvious bullshit.\u201d</p> <p>By contrast, Frenett says, if someone makes a post glorifying Hitler, or calls for genocide against Muslims, there is a high degree of certainty that they fall into a high-risk category. \u201cThey\u2019ve essentially tattooed a swastika to their forehead in the online space,\u201d he says. \u201cSo our level of confidence when identifying individuals who are vulnerable to radicalisation is way higher online than it could ever be offline. And it sidesteps some of the discriminatory, stigmatising practices we\u2019ve seen in an offline setting.\u201d</p> <p>Moonshot, founded in September 2015, is a for-profit company that earns its income from government contracts in the UK, US, Canada, Australia and across western Europe. It does not limit its work to any particular strain of radicalism; in addition to the far-right and jihadism, Moonshot\u2019s work covers everything from Buddhist extremism in south Asia, to Hindu nationalism and \u201cincel\u201d terrorism in Canada.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The skill is in finding out what raised a person\u2019s interest in extremist ideology. You can\u2019t redirect them until you do</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the broadest level, Moonshot runs what it refers to as \u201credirection material\u201d \u2013 advertising that is designed to \u201cget in front of\u201d extremist material in Google\u2019s search results. Google has granted Moonshot dispensation to advertise against banned search terms such as \u201cjoin Isis\u201d. If a user clicks on one of Moonshot\u2019s camouflaged results, they are taken to, for example, a mental health website with relevant downloadable guides and a chat option. (These sites are run by partnered mental health organisations and groups that have experience dealing with gang violence. As Frenett puts it, they have \u201cappropriate risk protocols, and connections with law enforcement, should they be required\u201d.) So long as the search terms are carefully calibrated (advertising against \u201cwhite power\u201d is useless, Frenett explains, as you end up competing with power-tool companies) this can be an effective first contact.</p> <p>Success is measured in much the same way as any company seeking to advertise on Google, via click conversions. (\u201cWe pay for advertising just like any commercial advertiser does,\u201d Ramalingam says. \u201cWe don\u2019t get special rates. I wish we had a better story on that front.\u201d) A key metric is \u201csearch impression share\u201d, which records the amount of time your at-risk audience saw the ad. \u201cWe\u2019ve had campaigns that have run with only 50%, and that\u2019s not good enough,\u201d Ramalingam says. \u201cSo we work hard to get that up to 98% where possible.\u201d For this reason, as well as mental health practitioners and ex-police officers, Moonshot also employs marketers. \u201cMost of our work is analytics, marketing and social work,\u201d Frenett says. \u201cIt just happens to be marketing, analytics and social work related to terrorism.\u201d</p> <p>Occasionally the company will identify an individual who is too high risk for their interventions. \u201cThat\u2019s where, depending on the country we\u2019re working in, we refer a user to the police,\u201d Frenett says. In Australia, for example, Moonshot identified someone at the top of a network of around 200 at-risk individuals considered \u201cso risky we couldn\u2019t intervene\u201d. A few days later, the local police arrested the man, who was subsequently convicted on terror charges.</p> <p>There are deeper kinds of intervention. One of Moonshot\u2019s advertisements for, say, \u201cbomb manuals\u201d will take the searcher to a WhatsApp chat manned by a specialist trained in deradicalisation techniques. The company may also identify someone on a particular social media platform openly espousing pro-extremist or pro-terrorist views. Then a trained social worker, typically from a charitable partner organisation, contacts that individual via Twitter direct message or Facebook Messenger. Choosing the right person to make this kind of contact, which may be perceived as invasive, is essential. In many cases, the right person is a former extremist \u2013 someone like Hanif Qadir.</p> <p>***</p> <p>When Qadir realised the children in the Afghan training camp were being measured for suicide vests, his first instinct was to exact revenge on the people who had manipulated him. \u201cBut I only had a knife, no gun,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I knew that I couldn\u2019t tell anyone I wanted out.\u201d</p> <p>He stepped outside the gate of the camp to consider his options. There he spotted the driver of a pick-up truck with whom he had talked a few times. The men did not share a first language, but Qadir gambled. He pulled out \u00a350 and waved it at the man, asking if he could hitch a ride to Turkham, on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The driver nodded. Qadir climbed into the passenger seat. \u201cI didn\u2019t even collect my bag,\u201d he recalls.</p> <p>Qadir says he cried during the flight to London. \u201cI kept asking myself: \u2018What the hell have I done?\u2019\u201d When he arrived home, he and his brothers attempted to find his recruiters, but they had disappeared; the word was that they had moved to Manchester. Qadir decided he no longer wanted to run the car business and convinced his brothers to sell up. \u201cI just wanted to stay at home with my children.\u201d</p> <p>After a period of recuperation, he and his brothers opened a gym in a disused nightclub, which became a place where local youths, many of them young Muslims, would congregate. \u201cWe\u2019d talk,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d ask them questions about Afghanistan. I saw a lot of anger and questioning. It was clear to me that all it would take is for one person to manipulate them emotionally and they would get straight on a plane to fight. Or maybe they would do something here.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92014a2374e6f83a792163e3a6aa1095258a1586\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92014a2374e6f83a792163e3a6aa1095258a1586/410_555_4164_2496/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hanif Qadir standing in a room with a pool table and graffiti-style art on the wall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hanif Qadir went to a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan, but now works with young people at risk of radicalisation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eager to communicate this to someone in a position of power, Qadir started attending local council meetings. A police inspector, Ian Larnder, took him for a coffee, hoping to better understand why this former mechanic seemed so passionate about the subject. \u201cUntil then, I had told nobody about what had happened,\u201d Qadir recalls. \u201cIan was the first person I opened up to.\u201d A week later, Larnder was appointed to the police\u2019s national community tension team. He took Qadir with him to speak to forces around the country about his experiences.</p> <p>Today, with a number of other former extremists, Qadir works with Moonshot, where he provides training for online interventions. \u201cThe skill is in finding out what has raised a person\u2019s interest in extremist ideology,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou can\u2019t redirect a person until you understand this. It\u2019s no good asking something so broad as: \u2018What do you think about what is happening in India?\u2019 It has to be specific and personable. So instead you might say: \u2018Is it permissible to seek revenge for the loss of a loved one?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>This sort of broad line of questioning \u2013 and the fact that an anonymous dialogue might tail off, without scope for any follow-up \u2013 can seem frustratingly opaque for anyone trying to measure Moonshot\u2019s success. It\u2019s a criticism the company is used to fielding. \u201cThe struggle with preventive work is that, very often, it\u2019s unscientific and we have to ask people to take it on trust,\u201d Frenett says. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for a military contractor to come in and say, \u2018I installed a big, high fence and a man with a gun and that reduced terrorism.\u2019 Likewise, the army can come along and state: \u2018We killed 200 Taliban this week.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s much harder to say, \u2018OK. We invested $1m here and we prevented this much terrorism.\u2019 Our long-term aim is to start to change that calculation. Then we\u2019ll be able to say: \u2018If one dollar in every 100 spent on military hardware went towards targeted, community-focused preventive work it would be better value \u2013 and probably better for the world.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>In the corner of a chilly room at the end of a corridor in Cardiff University\u2019s Glamorgan Building, a flood of racial slurs, misogyny, antisemitism and far-right slogans flows across a PC screen. \u201cImagine you had a crystal ball in which you could watch someone perpetrating every hate crime as it occurred somewhere out there, on the streets,\u201d explains Matthew Williams, director of HateLab. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re looking at here, except the hate is happening online.\u201d</p> <p>While Moonshot and Qadir intervene with individuals who are vulnerable to extremism, HateLab\u2019s aim is to provide a more accurate picture of hate speech across the internet. It is, Williams says, the first platform to use AI to detect online hate speech in real time and at scale.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Moonshot\u2019s ads for, say, \u2018bomb manuals\u2019 take the searcher to a WhatsApp chat manned by a deradicalisation specialist</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Online hatred is so commonplace that the majority of incidents go unreported. According to British government data, <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/748598/hate-crime-1718-hosb2018.pdf\" title=\"\">1,605 hate crimes occurred online between 2017 and 2018</a>, a 40% increase on the previous year. But the Home Office admits this figure is probably a gross underestimate. </p> <p>\u201cUnlike the police, we don\u2019t have to wait for a victim to file a report,\u201d Williams says. \u201cThe program reflects a true indication of the prevalence of online hatred.\u201d</p> <p>It offers a granular indication, too. Williams specifies a date range, then picks from a filter of potential target groups: Jews, homosexuals, women, and so on (misogyny is by far the most prevalent form of hate speech on Twitter, he says). He selects \u201canti-Muslim\u201d and a heat map of the UK lights up in red blotches showing geographical hotspots. Elsewhere, it reports the average number of hateful posts per minute and the peak times of day (hate speech, the group has found, is most prevalent during the daily commute, when people read and react to the day\u2019s news).</p> <p>A word cloud indicates the most-used anti-Muslim slurs, while a spiderweb visualises a network of perpetrators, identifying the \u201cthought leaders\u201d who are generating the most retweets, and how they are linked, via online accounts. \u201cHateLab gives situational awareness to hate speech on Twitter at any given time,\u201d Williams says. </p> <p>Early last month, HateLab identified three forms of coronavirus-related hate speech: anti-Chinese or Asian; antisemitic, focused on conspiracy theories; and Islamophobic, focused on accusations of profiteering. \u201cWhat we are seeing is a threat to health being weaponised to justify targeting minority groups, no matter how illogical the connections may seem,\u201d Williams explains.</p> <p>(Moonshot has monitored similar rises in hate speech targeting Chinese nationals. The hashtag #ChinaLiedPeopleDied was tweeted 65,895 times in March, while #coronavirustruth, implying that the pandemic is a hoax, was used 77,548 times. The company also picked up tweets showing old videos of Muslim men leaving mosques accompanied by text claiming the footage was filmed during quarantine, a <a href=\"https://tellmamauk.org/no-the-muslims-praying-in-this-video-arent-ignoring-the-coronavirus-lockdown-its-far-right-fake-news/\" title=\"\">seemingly deliberate attempt to create anti-Muslim sentiment</a>.)</p> <p>Williams, author of a forthcoming book titled The Science Of Hate, is a professor of criminology at Cardiff, but his interest in the field is not purely academic. In 1998, he travelled to London with friends to celebrate a birthday. At some point during the evening, he stepped out of the gay bar in which the group was drinking. Three young men approached. One asked if Williams had a light. As he handed over his Zippo, the man punched him in the face. Williams returned to his friends but said nothing, fearing that they would want to retaliate. Eventually, one of them noticed blood on his teeth and urged him to report the attack. \u201cI said no,\u201d Williams recalls. \u201cAt that time my parents didn\u2019t know I was gay. My siblings didn\u2019t know, and neither did most people from my town. I didn\u2019t want to come out to the police.\u201d</p> <p>But Williams returned to Wales a changed person. \u201cAny attack on your identity has a profoundly destabilising effect,\u201d he says. \u201cI became angry and depressed. I modified my behaviour. I stopped holding my boyfriend\u2019s hand. I still won\u2019t show affection in public.\u201d He was not alone in failing to report his attackers; based on the combined 2015/16 to 2017/18 Crime Survey for England and Wales, only 53% of <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/748598/hate-crime-1718-hosb2018.pdf\" title=\"\">hate crime incidents came to the attention of the police</a>. \u201cPeople are fearful of secondary victimisation,\u201d Williams says. </p> <p>As domestic internet use became more commonplace, Williams noticed the hate speech he encountered on the streets reflected online. The difference was that it was there for everyone to witness. Fellow academics were initially sceptical of his preoccupation with online behaviour, but by 2011 \u201ceveryone knew hate speech was the key problem of the internet\u201d. That year, Williams received a lottery grant of more than half a million pounds to accelerate his research.</p> <p>Every social media platform represents a torrent of information too deep and wide to sift by hand. Williams and his team began by taking a random sample of 4,000 tweets from a dataset of 200,000. The trove was then handed to four police officers, trained to recognise racial tensions, who each evaluated whether every tweet was discriminatory. If three of the four officers concurred, the tweet was classified as hate speech. Over a four-week period, the officers identified around 600 tweets they deemed discriminatory, data that formed the gold standard by which the AI would test if a message was \u201cmalignant\u201d or \u201cbenign\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You have to engage and create conversations, but direct them positively \u2013 allow for grievances to be heard and discussed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On the afternoon of 22 May 2013, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/dec/19/lee-rigby-murder-michael-adebolajo-adebowale-guilty\" title=\"\">fusilier Lee Rigby was killed</a> by two Islamist converts in Woolwich, London, the software had its first live test. Within 60 minutes of the attack, Williams and his team began harvesting tweets that used the keyword \u201cWoolwich\u201d. As the software sifted the data, the team was able to examine the drivers and inhibitors of hate speech, and identify accounts spreading anti-Muslim rhetoric. The team found that hate speech peaked for 24-48 hours, and then rapidly fell, while the baseline of online hate remained elevated for several months. Astonishingly, this was one of the first times a link between terror attacks and online hate speech had been demonstrated. And importantly, an increase in localised hate speech both anticipated the attack and, in the aftermath, shadowed it, showing that it might be possible to predict real world attacks.</p> <p>The data fascinated social scientists, but Williams believed it was more than interesting: it could have a practical application in helping counter these narratives. In 2017, he began a pilot scheme with the national online hate crime hub, which was set up to coordinate reporting into this area. It now uses the HateLab dashboard to gauge ebbs and flows in the targeting of particular groups, as well as nuances in local tensions. This information can then inform operational decisions, helping direct frontline police work.</p> <p>There are obvious privacy concerns, and HateLab must comply with data protection regulations. The platform depends on the willingness of Twitter to make its data available to third-party applications. (Facebook closed down open access in 2018, so independent organisations cannot screen its posts.) Twitter shares data on the proviso that HateLab does not identify individual accounts via its dashboard. \u201cIn that sense, we can only provide the 10,000ft view,\u201d Williams says. The dashboard can highlight patterns, target groups and geographical hotspots \u2013 but connecting with individuals is outside its remit.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Qadir and the other former extremists working alongside Moonshot recognise the power that hate speech can have, and know firsthand that a conversation can steer someone down a more positive path. \u201cYou can only change people if you can reach them via conversation,\u201d he tells me. \u201cViolent extremists do this very cleverly, and evidence shows that it works for them, so I based all my programmes on this concept. You have to engage and create conversations, but direct them positively \u2013 allow for grievances to be heard and discussed.\u201d</p> <p>Since Moonshot was founded, there has been a radical shift in the perception of technology\u2019s role when it comes to extremist terrorism. \u201cFive years ago, there were still people inside the government who thought tech was for the kids,\u201d Frenett says. \u201cThere was a sense that it was almost amusing that terrorists were on the internet. You don\u2019t get that any more. Likewise, five years ago there were some great organisations doing great work on the violent far-right, but again it was almost seen as niche. That\u2019s no longer the case.\u201d</p>",

Gilgun leads as Vinnie, a northern town ne\u2019er-do-well who charms his way through a succession of self-made problems while supported by a diversely ragtag gang. This is peak Gilgun, who always plays remixes of more-or-less the same character in everything he does, but manages it so well it doesn\u2019t matter: brash and tender and funny, with a faultline of emotional weakness running through him, at any one time either threatening to cry about how much his friends mean to him or, alternately, giving the finger to someone out of the window of a stolen lorry while crashing it through a locked gate. This could be him in This Is England, or Misfits, or Preacher, really, but right now it\u2019s him in Brassic, a near-perfect platform for Joe Gilgun to Gilgun on.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zINFJn3-qSM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zINFJn3-qSM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>That\u2019s not to take away from the rest of the cast, though: the smart foil of Damien Molony\u2019s Dylan, the mothering-as-a-form-of-friendship role of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/24/tv-tonight-our-girl-returns-to-danger\">Michelle Keegan</a>\u2019s Erin, Ryan Sampson as a gruff sex-empire proprietor and Dominic West as Vinnie\u2019s posh doctor. At first blush, the supporting cast seems unnecessarily huge, but the more you watch it the more things click together; the more every role in every caper makes sense.</p> <p>Structurally there are deep parallels between Brassic and the good old days of Shameless: a shambolic central lead who works his way through each episode with all the poise of a box of dropped cymbals; the Ocean\u2019s Eleven-by-way-of-Emmerdale way every plan is carefully plotted, disastrously undertaken and ultimately pulled off; a depiction of working-class life that presents poverty as a hurdle to be cheerfully leapt over once a week instead of the fundamental pulse that beats ominously behind every second of every day; one-shot characters who are far more interesting than most shows\u2019 actual leads (John Thomson plays a salty circus magician for two small scenes that, in any other circumstance, would demand their own spin-off commission).</p> <p>What I like most about Brassic is that it is an hour long. It doesn\u2019t need to be, and in the wrong hands that would be a problem: a 22-minute episode padded out with flimsy subplots, a pointless cameo, a forced one-episode romance. Instead, Brassic stretches each instalment out elegantly, giving it room to breathe: scenes run longer to accommodate extra funny lines; there are few of those structural, \u201cso what are we doing and where are we going?\u201d pieces that necessarily bolt shorter shows together. Joe Gilgun running around a village getting threatened by villains doesn\u2019t deserve to be as good as this, but it is. Here\u2019s to four or five more seasons.</p>",
  "<p>When Drew Layton dropped out of college in 2006 to play online poker full-time, it was a hard sell to his parents: \u201cThey were not thrilled,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But 14 years later, as coronavirus and the subsequent shelter-in-place orders have shut businesses around the globe and forced people to stay inside, some jobs have proven more stable than others. For Layton, online poker seems to be a good bet.</p> <p>Layton said he had seen a marked increase in traffic to websites where he plays and thus a rise in his income. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m thriving because of the pandemic, but one area of my life has gotten a little better,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of a sudden, being self-employed is a huge benefit.\u201d</p> <p>The four US states with legal online poker sites \u2013 New Jersey, Nevada, Delaware, and Pennsylvania \u2013 reported record revenues in March. Operators in New Jersey, for example, took in a combined $3,629,112 that month \u2013 an increase of 90.9% year over year, according to numbers reported by the <a href=\"https://www.gambling.com/news/pennsylvania-new-jersey-online-poker-revenues-set-records-2236300\">New Jersey </a><a href=\"https://www.gambling.com/news/pennsylvania-new-jersey-online-poker-revenues-set-records-2236300\">division of </a><a href=\"https://www.gambling.com/news/pennsylvania-new-jersey-online-poker-revenues-set-records-2236300\">gaming </a><a href=\"https://www.gambling.com/news/pennsylvania-new-jersey-online-poker-revenues-set-records-2236300\">enforcement</a>, and more than double February\u2019s online poker revenue. </p> <p>With more time being spent at home, the number of people turning to online poker is increasing, said Donnie Peters, managing editor of online poker news site and forum <a href=\"https://www.pocketfives.com/\">PocketFives.com</a>. Meanwhile, in states like New Jersey and Nevada where gambling is big business, many avid poker players unable to go to casinos may be migrating online. According to the American Gaming Association, a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/sports/ncaabasketball/coronavirus-sports-betting.html\">trade group</a>, 987 of the US\u2019s 989 casinos were closed by early April to stop the spread of the coronavirus. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/uk-betting-firms-to-stop-advertising-on-tv-and-radio-during-lockdown\">UK betting firms to stop advertising on TV and radio during lockdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Veteran players are making more money for two reasons, according to Peters. The influx of online players are generally newer to poker and more inexperienced, making it easier for professionals to win. And when the number of players increases, so does the pot \u2013 the money players wager.</p> <p>On Sunday, the online poker tournament GGPoker <a href=\"https://www.pocketfives.com/articles/sunday-majors-alex-foxen-wins-powerfest-big-game-for-239k-630553/\">beat its</a> $500,000 guarantee pot for the first time after 3,662 players joined. The recent WSOP.com Super Circuit Series, which was launched to replace a live event in Las Vegas, increased its prize money from $1.24m to $4m after a higher-than-expected turnout of players.</p> <p>\u201cWhat this means is that not only are those who make their income from poker able to do so more efficiently because they\u2019re playing against a larger population of weaker competition, but the money that can be won from online poker tournaments has grown,\u201d Peters said. \u201cIn short, professionals are able to win more money more often.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs unfortunate as a situation as this has been for so many, online poker is an industry that is flourishing right now,\u201d Peters said.</p> <p>But the rise in online gambling has also sparked concern. Those who already gambled online are doing so more often, a survey published in the UK on Friday found. Since the beginning of the Covid outbreak, 25% of gamblers said they were continuing to bet at least once a week while 28% had increased their activity,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/24/growth-in-problem-gambling-amid-coronavirus-lockdown\"> the survey showed</a>. This has worried anti-gambling advocates in the UK, who are calling for legislation to protect people from gambling their money away while on lockdown. UK betting firms have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/uk-betting-firms-to-stop-advertising-on-tv-and-radio-during-lockdown\">stopped advertising</a> on TV and radio.</p> <p>No similar research has been published yet in the US, but advocates there too are calling on states to take measures. The anti-gambling group Stop Predatory Gambling on 20 April <a href=\"https://www.casino.org/news/anti-gambling-group-calls-on-state-lotteries-to-suspend-operations/\">called</a> on states to halt to state lotteries.</p> <p>Although there is no federal law banning online poker, regulations bar it most states and many online poker sites block users based on their computer location. So-called \u201csocial poker sites\u201d do not allow betting and thus are legal across the country. Instead of betting on each hand, users participate in sweepstakes and get cash prizes. One such site, National League of Poker, saw a 30%-50% increase in new players in March alone and a 131% increase in revenue, a spokesman said.</p> <p>Some worry that the restrictions on online poker sites may cause novice online gamblers to turn to unregulated and dangerous offshore poker sites. \u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic has magnified this issue,\u201d said Jed Hoffman, who has been playing online poker for 12 years but does not play full-time. \u201cOne thing we don\u2019t need right now, as individuals or as communities, is any more risk, especially at the precipice of a serious recession.\u201d</p> <p>Hoffman said he has noticed about four times as much activity in the past month on his go-to poker site, which is legal and based in Nevada. On Monday, he took home $4,259 in a tournament on Monday he only paid $75 to join.</p> <p>\u201cI do hope people stuck in lockdown don\u2019t injure themselves economically by playing too much or too high,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cThat is bad for society, and bad for the viability of long term growth in the online poker community.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>In the US, the <a href=\"https://www.ncpgambling.org/help-treatment/national-helpline-1-800-522-4700/\">National Problem Gambling Helpline</a> can be reached at 1-800-522-4700.

These will be announced next week.

What authorities do not know yet is how the virus then took hold of the hospitals.</li> \n   <li>There has been a lot of excitement about experimental drugs to treat the virus given currently, the only treatment patients can receive is supportive care. However, these drugs should not be overhyped or seen as a breakthrough in the absence of rigorous evidence,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/30/australias-chief-scientist-warns-against-claims-of-breakthroughs-on-coronavirus-cures\"> experts including Australia\u2019s chief scientist have warned. </a></li> \n   <li>It comes as the US pharmaceutical company Gilead is finalising the location of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/01/remdesivir-five-australian-hospitals-to-receive-experimental-coronavirus-drug\">five hospitals in Australia to receive the highly sought-after experimental coronavirus drug remdesivir</a> which made headlines this week after being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/remdesivir-the-antiviral-drug-is-being-touted-as-a-possible-coronavirus-treatment-but-will-it-work\">promoted by the White House</a>.<br></li> \n   <li>ME Bank <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/01/customers-angry-as-me-bank-slashes-amount-they-can-withdraw-from-home-loans\">has slashed the amount an estimated 20,000 customers can redraw from their home loans by thousands of dollars</a>, drawing outrage from borrowers hoping to use the money during the coronavirus crisis.<br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>It seems as we go into the weekend, many are hopeful that we will be seeing some kind of easing of restrictions sooner than anticipated. But the last thing Australian wants is the situation we\u2019ve seen unfolding in Singapore, where after successful containment of the virus which were praised around the world, it experienced record-breaking days of new cases last week. The country has now implemented a lockdown.</p> \n  <p>This is something we are going to see those countries who are containing the virus increasingly grapple with over the next few weeks. The deputy chief medical officer on Friday described this navigation between a return to normality and avoiding unmitigated virus spread as a \u201cdance\u201d, and it\u2019s something that the national cabinet will be discussing over the coming days.</p> \n  <p>Let me know if I\u2019ve missed anything throughout the day <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MelissaLDavey\">over at Twitter</a> or at melissa.davey@theguardian.com .

  "<p>Covid-19: which celebrity is annoying you the most? Ever since the world went pretty much into lockdown in March, we have been offered an embarrassment of riches. And yes, it truly is an embarrassment. Whether it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/ellen-degeneres\">Ellen DeGeneres</a> joking that being trapped in one of her many multimillion dollar mansions was \u201clike being in prison\u201d, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/justin-bieber\">Justin Bieber</a> sighing that it was similarly tough being in his mansion, \u201cbut obviously, you know, we\u2019ve worked hard for where we\u2019re at, so it\u2019s like, we can\u2019t feel bad\u201d, or of course <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/20/comedians-gal-gadot-imagine-video-joe-lycett\">Gal Gadot\u2019s gruesome </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/20/comedians-gal-gadot-imagine-video-joe-lycett\">all-star medley of Imagine</a>, we have not been left short of examples of \u201cthe talent\u201d seeming to be completely tone deaf. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/madonna\">Madonna</a> intoned, from a bath strewn with petals, that this strand of coronavirus was \u201cthe great equaliser\u201d, it turned out she was quite right. Yes, we replied straight back, you\u2019re all equally irritating.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2020/mar/25/the-guide-staying-in-sign-up-for-our-home-entertainment-tips\">The Guide: Staying In  \u2013 sign up for our home entertainment tips</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The speed of the spread of Covid-19 has been one of the most astonishing things about it; the rate at which it emerged and upended all of our lives. It is no surprise, then, that it should affect celebrity culture in the same way. The pace at which artists of every kind responded to the crisis, mostly through their own social media channels, was only equalled by the ferocity with which the public clapped back as they exposed new depths of narcissism and privilege. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/arts/virus-celebrities.html\">\u201cCelebrity Culture is Burning,\u201d screeched the New York Times</a> a few weeks ago; <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/04/celebrity-coronavirus-social-media\">\u201cThere Is No Good Celebrity Content Right Now,\u201d decreed Vanity Fair</a>.</p> <p>Before we go further, it must be said that we are loving some stars more than ever in this crisis: whether that is Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson, diagnosed with the virus early and handling their predicament with good grace (or, more to the point, communicating that good grace well, too); or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/meerasyal\">Meera Syal</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/naughtyboymusic\">Naughty Boy</a>, who have used their platform to broadcast health advice to the British BAME community, which seems to be disproportionately affected by the crisis; or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/08/john-krasinski-a-quiet-place-emily-blunt-horror\">John Krasinski</a>, who created a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOe_y6KKvS3PdIfb9q9pGug\">\u201cgood news\u201d YouTube show</a>, offering a virtual prom for high schoolers deprived of the real thing, and helping healthcare workers get tickets for their favourite baseball team.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b1c82d65fd2db9d179431a8cfa8eaef3944ff0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b1c82d65fd2db9d179431a8cfa8eaef3944ff0a/21_58_1470_1142/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ellen Degeneres at home.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"777\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sofa, so good... Ellen DeGeneres.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A kind of rigorously selfless approach seems to have defined the efforts of those who are coming out of this well (it helps, of course, if you already liked them in the first place). When, on Instagram Live (the stars\u2019 favourite recourse to publicity in these times), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/rihanna\">Rihanna</a> was asked yet again where her latest album is, she snapped back that she was busy \u201ctrying to save the world\u201d \u2013 after all, she has, among other things, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/10/rihanna-1-point-coronavirus-lockdown-donation-los-angeles-domestic-violence\">donated bucketloads of money</a>. Now, if some other celebrity had said that, we might not have been so forgiving. Yet people seem to have liked the comment; for one thing, that\u2019s how we like RiRi to talk, and, for another, unlike those stars who mostly seemed to have just been lecturing us from a (suitable) distance, there is the sense that she really is trying to save the world . </p> <p>Often, though, a simmering annoyance is defining many people\u2019s engagement with the biggest entertainers. And if you stop and think about it, there is a thudding inevitability to it. Not only are we, the public, cooped up at home, glued to our smartphones, with fewer places to vent our frustrations, but they, the stars, are as well. People who positively thrive off gaining our attention \u2013 who make a living both financially and emotionally from it \u2013 have had their means of doing so drastically reduced. Because it is vital to point out that the showbiz economy has been decimated: no TV shows or films being made, no plays staged, no festivals all summer, no \u201cevents\u201d that even that brightest new strand of celebrity, the influencer, can \u201cinfluence\u201d from. Whether you are dealing in old-school showbiz entertainment or very new-school social media performance, your stage has been shut down. And so it is that many have thrown themselves at their own phones, their last remaining medium, with a desperate fervour \u2013 and often equally desperate results.</p> <p>The ones who have most galled people \u2013 eg Sam Smith vlogging about having a \u201cquarantine meltdown\u201d from their mansion \u2013 have done so for a couple of reasons, diagnoses <a href=\"https://www.city.ac.uk/people/academics/chris-rojek\">Chris Rojek</a>, professor of sociology at City University, London, and author of an academic study of celebrity. If we now live in a world where celebrities are rated more than politicians \u2013 and can indeed take politicians\u2019 jobs \u2013 it\u2019s because they feel more \u201creal\u201d, says Rojek. Over the last century, stars became more and more intimate-seeming as they entered our homes via first the radio, then television and then, latterly, the internet.</p> <p>Indeed, the creation of Twitter, Facebook and Instagram has just accelerated the trend where celebs appear to us every single day, telling us stories about their lives and helping us make sense of ours. So, when all is well, they can project a profitable relatability. The intended effect is that \u201cyou can trust these people and what they say, because they seem more on your side than a politician,\u201d says Rojek.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/B95M4kNhbzz/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

They have inserted themselves in pretty much every facet of existence, from how to bake muffins to navigating war zones, and this is now broadly accepted as the norm. Again, this isn\u2019t necessarily sinister: Tom Hanks\u2019s Covid-19 diagnosis is credited with helping many Americans take the virus seriously (unlike, say, their president).</p> <p>When assorted superstars transmit messages from their mega-compounds in the countryside, they are reminding us that they are \u201cuntouchable\u201d, says Rojek. \u201cHere you are, saying: \u2018We\u2019re all in this together,\u2019 but you\u2019re actually underlining the fact that an enormous gulf separates celebrities from ordinary people.\u201d It is true that one of the fun side-effects of this crisis has been gaining ever more insight into celebrities\u2019 home lives, but the gawping has often turned sour.</p> <p>The funny thing is, though, we always knew this gulf existed. We did not need Covid-19 to get a peek into Ellen DeGeneres\u2019s or the Beckhams\u2019 mansions; we had had plenty of peeks already, as they invited us (at well-curated moments) into their own houses. The greatest stars of the 2010s, the Kardashian clan, built their behemoth brand round a show set for the most part in their airy LA homes. So why are we finding this so grating now? It could be that, before, we liked to think we could aspire to that lifestyle, somehow. Even a tiny unconscious part of you might still believe you could live like Kendall Jenner. Now, locked at home and with diminished income, the gap seems concrete and unbridgeable.</p> <p>Also, says Rojek, it might not just be a simple frustration that these people are far more privileged than us. \u201cI think one of the factors that is different about the virus is the sense that celebrities are appearing to the audience as irrelevant. The cure now lies with medical staff and with scientists and politicians. It\u2019s becoming apparent, in a crisis like this, that whatever gestures celebrities have made, they\u2019re as helpless as the ordinary person.\u201d Naturally, this is not a sexy look.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0659f4b7ab4b2172edda5605c21b0e5df11c5cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0659f4b7ab4b2172edda5605c21b0e5df11c5cb/243_0_3750_2251/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lady Gaga performing during One World\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All we hear is... Lady Gaga performing during One World: Together at Home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toge/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Funnily enough, so far it seems like the best way for an entertainer to handle the current crisis is just to, well, entertain. Whether it\u2019s Florence Pugh cooking up a storm in her kitchen on her Instastories, or a whole galaxy of singers just sticking to their day job, singing, in Lady Gaga\u2019s Together at Home concert, we are mostly appreciative of good, old-fashioned distraction. In today\u2019s cluttered celebrity landscape, it comes as a kind of relief. One of the most dominant stories being told in this Covid-19 era is that it could lead us back to a kind of simplification, or detox, and this applies to showbiz, too; there seems to be a persistent hope this pandemic may yet sort the celebrity wheat from the sublebrity chaff. It is an impression that is reinforced when I speak to one senior showbiz publicist in London, who looks after a handful of old-school megastars. \u201cEurgh! Influencers!\u201d he cries. If coronavirus does us one favour, he suggests, it would be to flatten the curve of the influencer boom. </p> <p>He may get his wish: there have been reports of influencers struggling to make ends meet, the events they post their missives from having all now evaporated. The publicist isn\u2019t too sympathetic. \u201cI think that proper celebrities \u2013 ie people that are talented and creative \u2013 might enjoy this time,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ll write a brilliant book or a brilliant song. But \u2018celebrities\u2019 in the modern sense of the word are gonna shrink, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p> <p>Certainly, it\u2019s true that for those who once motored on, constantly producing cosily banal content every day for content\u2019s sake, the machine has started to splutter. Instead, the publicist believes that all this will usher in a more austere take on celebrity culture. \u201cI saw something the other day where someone wrote: \u2018Why don\u2019t we fill the Strictly lineup with health workers and real life?\u2019 Although I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll do that, I do think there\u2019ll be a shift away from the sort of champagne-lifestyle celebrity.\u201d</p> <p>And yet \u2026 will there be? Coronavirus is unprecedented, and it is too early to grasp its effects on the celebrity ecosystem. For instance, the publicist thinks that many stars have already stopped keeping their PR teams on retainers; will they go back to them? Can gossip sites such as TMZ subsist on just reporting on celebrities\u2019 Instastories in lockdown? Still, it would be naive to hope that it will somehow undo the total dominance over our culture that celebrities have achieved throughout the 20th century and into the 21st. Yes, we may gripe and grouch and push back, chew them up and turn them into memes, but are we any less dependent on them? And, frankly, in a culture that looks set to be stripped back for months to come, what other options for entertainment do we have? Perhaps we need to be more honest with ourselves as to what we want from our stars. We may chuckle at their desperate need for approval but it works both ways, says Rojek. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that celebrities are going to go away because what we will need from them is that feeling of grounding, that somebody understands us,\u201d he says. If Covid-19 reveals the extent of our celebrity culture addiction, it doesn\u2019t yet offer us a way to wean ourselves off it. Honestly, imagine a world where your day was not brightened by Gal Gadot having Kristen Wiig mutter some John Lennon at you in a wide-brimmed fedora. No, really \u2013 can you?</p>",

One patient might have his or her sinuses probed by a swab at a drive-thru, while another might spit in a tube at home and another give a blood sample at a clinic.</p> <p>Each test has a different degree of reliability, with different amounts of time and labor required to complete the boomerang curve of sample collection to testing to result report.</p> <p>\u201cWe have too many [brands of] tests, and now there are a lot of people who are committed to their tests and they run their tests on their platforms,\u201d said Paul Reider, a renowned research chemist in the pharmaceuticals industry who teaches at Princeton University.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>We have too many [brands of] tests, and now there are a lot of people who are committed to their tests</p> <footer> <cite>Paul Reider, Princeton University</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf we had an effective administration \u2013 this is where the federal government comes in \u2013 they could essentially turn around and say, \u2018What we would like to do is, we want one test, maybe two, that are fast, that are accurate, that are scalable and transferable, .</p> <p>\u201cYou want a gold-standard test.\u201d</p> <p>In the US, regulatory and administrative hurdles are everywhere, with clinics unable to send samples to private labs that might be out of their usual networks, a lack of protocols for reporting testing data, slow regulatory approval for the use of alternative testing materials, insufficient federal funding to support lab efforts and no central leadership steering the country\u2019s massive laboratory apparatus.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a system that\u2019s ever been built for surveillance, for wide-scale population surveillance or wide-scale testing for people who aren\u2019t presenting to the hospital or the clinic,\u201d said Mina. \u201cThe demand is just so much larger than our system was built for.\u201d</p> <p>The Trump administration\u2019s response to this complicated thicket has been to declare the federal government a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/27/politics/white-house-releases-state-guidelines-on-coronavirus-testing/index.html\">supplier of last resort</a>\u201d and wish the states luck. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple,\u201d Trump has said. \u201cThey have tremendous capacity.

  "<p>The effects of the coronavirus crisis have been felt everywhere, but one of the hardest hit sectors has been the holiday industry. With resorts closed and all but essential journeys banned in countries across the world, 2020 looks set to be the year that travel was put on hold.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/who-declares-coronavirus-pandemic\">Less than two months into the pandemic</a>, thousands of holidays, honeymoons, backpacking trips, cruises, and city breaks have either been cancelled, or look like they will be.</p> <p>The shutdown has left hundreds of thousands of consumers out of pocket, in some cases by more than \u00a320,000. It has also left the travel industry fighting to survive. Here, we try to navigate you through the chaos.</p> <h2><strong>My flight </strong><strong>has been cancelled and </strong><strong>all I\u2019m being offered is an alternative flight or vouchers </strong>\u2013<strong> is this legal?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1cecaae1d68a5ae68d6d1195769682e41f51672\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1cecaae1d68a5ae68d6d1195769682e41f51672/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Signs asking people to not use seats in Terminal 5 at Heathrow airport\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coronavirus restrictions at Heathrow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No. But that hasn\u2019t stopped airlines doing exactly that. All flights on EU carriers within, or heading into the EU, and all flights leaving from an EU airport, are protected by \u201cdenied boarding\u201d rules, which require a full refund in seven days when flights are cancelled.</p> <p>The problem is that enforcing these rights is proving very difficult. Many airlines are making it near impossible to get refunds in the hope that customers will reschedule or accept vouchers instead.</p> <p>After initially promising to reimburse consumers within 20 working days, Ryanair has now said they should <a href=\"https://www.ryanair.com/ie/en/useful-info/refund-voucher\">accept vouchers</a> valid for 12 months, which it will then refund if not used by the end of the year. Alternatively, it says customers can wait until the \u201ccrisis has passed\u201d for a refund.</p> <p>Refunds at British Airways are being processed only by customer services, which is proving difficult to contact. It\u2019s a similar story across the sector, and the regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, has so far declined to intervene. Airlines have asked the EU to suspend the rules and allow vouchers instead, although it is hard to see how this could be applied retrospectively.</p> <h2><strong>In the face of a no-refund policy, what should I do</strong>?</h2> <p>Accepting replacement vouchers is risky. While Ryanair looks safe, some airlines have already collapsed and others, including Norwegian, are in bailout talks.</p> <p>Coby Benson, a solicitor at the specialist flight compensation firm Bott and Co, says the law is on the side of cash refunds. He advises customers to submit their refund request using the following text:</p> <p>\u201cI understand that my flight [flight number] on [flight date] has been cancelled and I therefore request a full refund pursuant to articles 5(1)(a) and 8(1)(a) of EC Regulation No.261/2004. For the avoidance of doubt, I do not accept a travel voucher.\u201d</p> <p>There is evidence that passengers have been getting refunds \u2013 but only after very long waits.</p> <p>If the airline does not respond or refuses to comply, you can issue small court proceedings or use the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alternative-dispute-resolution-for-consumers/alternative-dispute-resolution-for-consumers\">Alternative Dispute Resolution</a>. You will need the airline\u2019s address, which can usually be found online.</p> <p>Benson says all claims for flights that started or ended in the UK can be heard in Britain\u2019s courts. The other option is to approach your bank card provider (see below).</p> <h2><strong>My flight operated as scheduled but I was unable to go on it due to the lockdown. What then?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4792c81c5f0949a7ce2b68e41462d258eed7e673\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4792c81c5f0949a7ce2b68e41462d258eed7e673/0_150_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Planes on a runway in Seattle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Several airlines are still running flights in and out of UK airports.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary He/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Amazingly, several airlines are still running flights in and out of UK airports, meaning the trip is not cancelled.</p> <p>Richard Colbey, a barrister at Lamb Chambers, says the fact that it is currently illegal to go on holiday to, say Lisbon, means that the contract between the passenger and the airline can be deemed to be \u201cfrustrated\u201d. In such cases a refund is due, although the customer may have to resort to the courts to get the money.</p> <p>The easier option for many will be to claim on travel insurance. Because the government advised against all but essential travel, policies should pay cancellation claims provided you bought it before the pandemic was declared on 11 March.</p> <h2><strong>I had a package holiday booked</strong><strong>, what are my rights?</strong></h2> <p>Package tour operators are required to refund customers within 14 days when a trip is cancelled. However, in many cases refunds have been denied and holidaymakers told they must rebook or accept vouchers.</p> <p>Tui said this week it would give customers accepting vouchers a 20% \u201cbooking incentive\u201d \u2013 extra money to spend on their next break. However, you are under no obligation to take the vouchers and can insist on a refund.</p> <p>Your replacement voucher or new booking is protected by the government-backed Atol scheme in the event that the tour operator collapses before the trip is taken.</p> <p>If a refund is not offered, write to the travel firm stating that you want one under the terms of the package travel and linked travel arrangement regulations 2018, stressing that you will not accept vouchers. If have lost your job or income, ask to be moved to the front of the queue.</p> <p>Travel insurers will not pay out when the tour operator is legally obliged to refund and is still trading.</p> <h2><strong>I\u2019m booked to go away over the May half-term or in June, but I don\u2019t want to go</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1ef8b63ad6fe844c8fdd0eba2decf498975607ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ef8b63ad6fe844c8fdd0eba2decf498975607ed/0_338_5000_2999/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A row of white terraced cottages in Boscastle village, Cornwall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boscastle village, Cornwall.

If the Foreign Office continues to advise against all but essential travel, your tour operator will have cancel and a full refund will be due.</p> <p>Even if you have no intention of travelling, do not cancel the holiday yourself as you will lose your booking and the possible refund. </p> <p>It is a similar story for UK trips. Whether these will happen will depend on the lockdown measures still in place. Holiday cottages in Cornwall, for example, may technically be accessible in May and June. But will the government allow such travel?</p> <h2><strong>What about my Airbnb booking?</strong></h2> <p>The company is offering fee-free cancellations for those who booked their trips before 15 March and planned to check in before the end of May. Stays starting on 1 June onwards, and those booked after 15 March, currently carry the normal cancellation terms, unless you are ill and can show that there are extenuating circumstances. Airbnb is constantly changing its terms, so check for the latest updates.</p> <h2><strong>What about </strong><strong>ferry companies?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"033a8ee09d090ca7f27e6b854f348ae7ed7d8245\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/033a8ee09d090ca7f27e6b854f348ae7ed7d8245/0_0_7952_4771/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman looking at scenic view from a ferry in Norway\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Many ferries are still in operation during the pandemic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oleh Slobodeniuk/Getty /iStockPhoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stena has won praise from readers for offering vouchers and refunds on its trips to Holland and across the Irish Sea, including for non-refundable tickets, even though its ferries are still running. Brittany Ferries, however, has cancelled all passenger sailings up to 15 May and is only offering credit notes. Again, you do not have to accept this: <a href=\"https://www.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/advice/ferry-delay-your-rights#ferry-cancellation-rights\">consumers can ask for a refund for cancelled services,</a> which should be provided within seven days.</p> <p>P&amp;O is still running its services and therefore is not cancelling, although its would-be passengers clearly cannot use the service during the lockdown. It is only offering vouchers, which have to be used for future bookings.</p> <h2><strong>I had a holiday cottage booked but the owner won\u2019t refund</strong><strong> me</strong></h2> <p>Many owners have offered alternative dates later in the year, which could be a very attractive option come August, but this will not suit everyone.</p> <p>On 23 March the government <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/further-businesses-and-premises-to-close/further-businesses-and-premises-to-close-guidance\">ordered all holiday accommodation</a> to close, except in a few circumstances. Until the ban is lifted, bookers can insist on a refund, arguing that the contract was deemed to be frustrated. You can expect a battle, if our mailbag is anything to go by, but the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/uk-watchdog-vows-to-get-tough-with-uk-firms-over-stalled-refunds\">competition regulator has warned firms that they could face legal action</a> if they do not refund customers.</p> <h2><strong>I have paid a deposit on a</strong><strong> summer trip</strong><strong> and the holiday firm is now </strong><strong>requesting </strong><strong>the rest \u2013 what should I do?</strong></h2> <p>This is a conundrum lots of people are facing. Generally, the advice is to pay the balance owed, because if you do nothing you are deemed to have cancelled and will lose the deposit.</p> <p>If the holiday is subsequently cancelled you will get all your money back. This week easyJet Holidays said customers who had paid deposits on trips this summer could use them next year. Other operators may follow suit, so it is worth asking if you would like to delay a year.</p> <p>Ultimately, consumers are going to have to consider their financial situation. If you paid a deposit of \u00a350 on a \u00a32,000 cruise that you now have no intention of taking, you would probably be better off accepting the \u00a350 loss than paying the rest and fighting to get it back.</p> <h2><strong>What will my travel insurance cover?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"71e8d3378d63a86a478252e6b31ad98836266d9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71e8d3378d63a86a478252e6b31ad98836266d9b/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roseau, Dominica\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roseau, Dominica.

However, insurers will not be paying out where the tour operator/airline simply refuses a refund or offers vouchers instead. Most policies bought after 11 March will not offer any Covid-19 related claims.</p> <p>If your airline collapses before your departure, half of policies \u2013 those with scheduled airline failure cover \u2013 should compensate customers. If you have to cancel a holiday in, say, September because you were due to take elderly parents \u2013 and they have been advised by the government/doctor against travelling \u2013 this claim should succeed, provided you bought the policy and holiday before March.</p> <p>If your legitimate claim is turned down, the Financial Ombudsman Service can adjudicate your dispute free of charge. There are signs that some travel insurers will be rejecting claims and hoping the claimants give up. Do not.</p> <h2><strong>Will my debit or credit card provider come to my aid?</strong></h2> <p>Consumers who bought their trips using bank cards do have two other avenues to go down if they are denied a refund \u2013 a chargeback or a section 75 claim.</p> <p>Where there has a been a breach of contract \u2013 the holiday/flight has been not provided \u2013 you can ask your bank to reverse the payments. There is no legal obligation on the bank to process a chargeback, and the retailer can object, but consumers have had success with them in the past. If your online travel agent, in particular, will not deal with your refund, a chargeback is worth trying.</p> <p>Section 75 claims are a legal obligation and make the credit card firm jointly liable for the service bought, provided it cost more than \u00a3100 and you bought it directly from the provider. If the airline goes bust and you bought the ticket from it directly, the credit card provider has to refund you.</p> <p>The problem is the banks are reluctant to process section 75 claims in the best of times, and there have been reports of some refusing to process them in the current climate. When things finally calm down we suspect many passengers will be forced down this route.</p> <h2><strong>Can I book a trip for </strong><strong>later in the year?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06691523a86991f9b15a40351749fc0d8c74b91a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06691523a86991f9b15a40351749fc0d8c74b91a/31_0_5464_3278/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclists on their way up to the Herzogstand mountain near the village Walchensee, southern Germany.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Self-guided walking or cycling trips are likely to enable travellers to limit social mixing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christof Stache/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You can.

  "<p>Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Melissa Davey bringing you the main stories on Saturday 2 May.</p> \n<h2>Spread throughout NSW nursing home continues</h2> \n<p>Another two staff members at Sydney\u2019s Newmarch House nursing home have tested positive for Covid-19 following the deaths of 13 residents. The New South Wales chief medical officer, Dr Kerry Chant, has said NSW Health <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/02/investigation-into-possible-breaches-of-coronavirus-infection-control-at-newmarch-house\">will look into the possibility that infection controls were breached</a>. More than one-third of the home\u2019s residents have now been infected. Anglicare, which manages the home, said on Saturday that the new infections occurred \u201cdespite having strict procedures and enforced infection control practices in place\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are investigating further as to how this occurred and we continue to work closely with the NSW public health unit on this. Additional positive cases associated with Newmarch House are very distressing for our staff, our residents, and their families,\u201d Anglicare said in a statement. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/02/why-is-it-spreading-sydneys-newmarch-house-aged-care-home-becomes-epicentre-of-covid-19-fight\">Read more about how the highly infectious virus was able to take hold in the home</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/well-feel-a-bit-more-human-australians-welcome-partial-lift-of-coronavirus-lockdown\">'We'll feel a bit more human': Australians welcome partial lift of coronavirus lockdown</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>Restrictions begin to ease throughout the country</h2> \n<p>Queenslanders are enjoying their first weekend under eased restrictions, which means they can leave their home for recreation. They can have a picnic, shop for non-essential items, and the distance they can travel has also been extended. Some national parks are also open. Meanwhile the Tasmanian premier, Peter Gutwein, confirmed that as of midnight Sunday, extra restrictions in the north-west of the state, put in place following clusters of the virus in two hospitals, will be removed. On Friday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/well-feel-a-bit-more-human-australians-welcome-partial-lift-of-coronavirus-lockdown\">NSW partially relaxed its restrictions so that up to two adults (and any dependent children) can visit any other household</a>.</p> \n<p>While restrictions have eased elsewhere in Australia, they remain in place in Victoria. There are only four reasons for people in the state to leave their home: food and supplies, medical care and care giving, exercise, and work or education. Two further meetings of national cabinet are scheduled next week, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/morrison-says-early-mark-of-eased-restrictions-depends-on-uptake-of-covidsafe-tracing-app\">leaders to decide on Friday how federal restrictions can be eased</a>.

They received final approvals on Saturday. The latest green light was crucial for the NRL\u2019s ambition of a return by 28 May. The NRL chairman,<strong> </strong>Peter V\u2019landys, said the Warriors would join every club in a mandatory education day on Monday to ensure players toed the line during the coronavirus pandemic.

  "<p>There is a strange noise coming from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/21/tracee-ellis-ross-crush-bim-adewunmi\" title=\"\">Tracee Ellis Ross</a>\u2019s Los Angeles garden. Hang on, she says, looking away from her computer screen to the window with an alarmed expression. \u201cI\u2019m just going to go check that out. Stand by!\u201d</p> <p>If this were a horror movie, then the stylish woman disappearing into the distance would never come back. But it isn\u2019t a horror movie, it\u2019s a Zoom interview, and Ross, a Golden Globe-winning actor best known for her role in the US sitcom <a href=\"https://abc.com/shows/blackish\" title=\"\">Black-ish</a>, is talking to me from the sunny living room of her home. Or at least she was; right now, I\u2019m staring at a fiddle-leaf fig tree and a comfortable-looking couch.</p> <p>In a youth-obsessed Hollywood, many women find their careers decline with age, but at 47, Ross appears to be just hitting her stride. The actor, activist and entrepreneur has been in the public eye since her 20s, but started getting serious attention only in her early 40s, with Black-ish. Now on its sixth season, the show centres on an upper-middle-class African American family, living in a largely white LA neighbourhood, and stars Ross as the matriarch, anaesthetist Rainbow \u201cBow\u201d Johnson. Its unapologetic handling of race-related issues has turned the comedy into something of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/25/series-creator-kenya-barris-on-abc-sitcom-black-ish\" title=\"\">cultural phenomenon</a>. Barack and Michelle Obama are fans; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/517293224831234048?s=20\" title=\"\">Donald Trump, who tweeted that the show was racism at the highest level, is not</a>.</p> <p>A few minutes after vanishing, Ross slides back in front of her computer and gives the all clear. There is no emergency except, you know, the one we\u2019re all living through. At the time of speaking, LA has been under lockdown for almost a month and, like the rest of us, Ross is still struggling to get to grips with it. \u201cI think we\u2019re all dealing with these waves of emotion where everything seems fine. And then it hits you. It\u2019s like the fear is just waiting right there.\u201d She gestures towards the window.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ff6de3ecc67a7d8a403fe5d1b029d7fa0695b59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ff6de3ecc67a7d8a403fe5d1b029d7fa0695b59/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tracee Ellis Ross in ABC\u2019s Black-ish Season Six, 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Black-ish season six this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Raymond Liu/ABC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fear has not infiltrated her wardrobe. Ross\u2019s hair is styled into two Princess Leia-like space buns and she\u2019s wearing a floral, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jun/30/tate-modernist-how-georgia-okeeffe-shaped-feminist-style\" title=\"\">Georgia O\u2019Keeffe</a>-esque top. Even through the awkward interface of a Zoom call, her signature mix of goofiness and glamour comes through \u2013 a willingness to poke fun at herself that is a large part of her on-screen appeal. As Black-ish creator Kenya Barris once <a href=\"https://www.backstage.com/magazine/article/tracee-ellis-ross-loves-auditioning-8802/\" title=\"\">put it</a>, Ross \u201ccan do expressions and physical movement that take a joke from a five to a 10\u201d.</p> <p>But if Ross seems down to earth, her childhood was anything but. Her mother is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/diana-ross\" title=\"\">Diana Ross</a>, and her father, Robert Ellis Silberstein, is a successful music executive, who managed the likes of Ronnie Wood and Meat Loaf. As a child, she attended an elite school in Manhattan, and did a stint at the type of Swiss boarding school where a typical gym class means a skiing lesson. She did a photoshoot with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/andywarhol\" title=\"\">Andy Warhol</a> when she was 11, and modelled in her teens. How, I ask, did she avoid turning into a brat?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been taught that you work for the things you want,\u201d Ross says. \u201cMy mom always joked: \u2018I\u2019m not leaving you guys any of this money. I made this money for me! I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s a roof over your head. You can have health insurance and food. But other than that\u2026\u2019 I mean, I had a job in high school. I worked as a salesperson at Ralph Lauren. My mom was like, \u2018If you want to keep buying those clothes, you\u2019re going to have to figure out how to pay for them.\u2019 There was a commitment on her part to a normalcy that I have taken into my adult life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d2246e50007eeddf3fec712ede1722db2f5afa6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d2246e50007eeddf3fec712ede1722db2f5afa6/0_875_2263_1711/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Diana Ross with her daughters backstage at the Palace Theater in New York June 14 1976.

Her parents split when she was five but remained on good terms, and the childhood she shared with her siblings (four of whom were Diana Ross\u2019s children, and three of whom were step-siblings from Ross\u2019s second marriage) sounds happy and wholesome.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Being the child of somebody famous might unlock the door, but the people on the other side have their arms crossed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cMy mom always put us in bed, then she\u2019d go to the recording studio while we were sleeping. She\u2019d sit with us for dinner and she never left for more than a week.\u201d Ross remembers her mother getting the kids to help her make the beds, and she remains a pro at hospital corners. Actually, she says, she still has some of those sheets. \u201cI nicked them out of the closet at home and Mom doesn\u2019t know I have them. They remind me of my childhood.\u201d</p> <p>But being her mother\u2019s daughter didn\u2019t necessarily help when it came to work. \u201cWhen I was starting in my career, being the child of somebody famous was not what it is today,\u201d Ross says. \u201cIt might unlock the door, but the people sitting on the other side have their arms crossed and are asking: \u2018OK, is she as good as her mom?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She got her first big break as a comic on MTV\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0239178/\" title=\"\">The Lyricist Lounge Show</a> in 2000. The same year, she landed a lead role on the sitcom <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247102/\" title=\"\">Girlfriends</a>, which ran for eight seasons, making it the longest-running live-action network sitcom at the time; but its predominantly black cast meant it was always pigeonholed as a \u201cblack show\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"806cf3aa15fc5a6f16ecd39a39e62037eb15785a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/806cf3aa15fc5a6f16ecd39a39e62037eb15785a/0_505_2250_2096/1000.jpg\" alt=\"JILL MARIE JONES, TRACEE ELLIS ROSS, PERSIA WHITE, GOLDEN BROOKS AND REGINALD C HAYES, IN GIRLFRIENDS, SEASON 3, 2002\" width=\"1000\" height=\"932\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Girlfriends in 2002.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AF archive/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe landscape of television was not the same as it is now,\u201d Ross says. \u201cIt was still very segregated. We go through waves in this country, around celebrating black narratives: the early 2000s were not that time.\u201d Despite the size of Girlfriends\u2019 audience, she didn\u2019t get invited on to the late-night TV shows, or the award shows, or the high-profile industry events. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a matter of how many eyeballs were watching the show,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a matter of <em>which</em> eyeballs were watching.\u201d</p> <p>Then, in 2014, Black-ish came along and \u201ceverything started to happen\u201d. In 2017 she won a Golden Globe for her role, making her the first black woman to pick up the award since 1983 (when <a href=\"https://www.goldenglobes.com/person/debbie-allen\" title=\"\">Debbie Allen won for Fame</a>). Her proud family had already taken out a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TraceeEllisRoss/status/765708111327866880/photo/1\" title=\"\">full-page ad</a> in the Hollywood Reporter to congratulate her on the nomination.</p> <p>Ross says one of the things that drew her to Black-ish was the way it disrupted conventional narratives. There is a warmth and respect between Bow and her on-screen husband, Andre \u201cDre\u201d Johnson, that isn\u2019t always evident in sitcoms. \u201cOften the comedy of married couples on television is about how they roll their eyes at each other, how they frustrate each other,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve never enjoyed that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d3764fa9e8a9afdf1543e663a42bbd5a3eb4c140\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3764fa9e8a9afdf1543e663a42bbd5a3eb4c140/60_27_2543_3973/640.jpg\" alt=\"Tracee Ellis Ross, winner of Outstanding Actress in a Comedy Series, attends the 50th NAACP Image Awards at Dolby Theatre on March 30, 2019 in Hollywood, California\" width=\"640\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With her NAACP award for Black-ish last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot that poked holes in the status quo, particularly as a woman of colour,\u201d she continues. \u201cWhile the story is told through the eyes of the man, I\u2019m not just the wife. I\u2019m not just a doctor. I\u2019m not just a mom. I\u2019m all of those things. And my point of view is not seen in relation to Dre\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s based in my experience and my life.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes, Ross says, Bow\u2019s autonomy was \u201cnaturally written into the script\u201d and sometimes she pushed for it. \u201cI\u2019m very conscious about not perpetuating stereotypes,\u201d she explains. \u201cIn a scene, if they have written that I\u2019m doing \u2018lady-chores\u2019 such as the cooking, I\u2019m like: why? It\u2019s not pivotal to the story. Let Dre do the chopping and I\u2019ll stand here at my computer, or drink a glass of wine, or hold a book. I speak up and I drive them crazy sometimes. But in the context of being a black woman on television, I am very aware of what that imagery says and the stereotypes it perpetuates. My interest is in offering other expressions, other examples, other imagery.\u201d</p> <p>Some of that \u201cother imagery\u201d is the experience of being mixed race, which we don\u2019t always see on mainstream TV. \u201cI had never, ever played that in my career,\u201d Ross says. \u201cEven though [being half black and half Jewish], that\u2019s what I live.\u201d While her character is clearly mixed race, Black-ish didn\u2019t meaningfully explore that facet of Bow\u2019s identity. \u201cIt ended up being relegated to this space of jokes,\u201d Ross says. \u201cAs a mixed person, you\u2019re constantly being bombarded by questions such as, \u2018Are you this, or are you that?\u2019 which is the least interesting part of being mixed\u2026\u201d She trails off for a second, losing her thread. \u201cYou know when you haven\u2019t been talking a lot?\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like you lose access to words.\u201d</p> <p>She makes a wide-mouthed, silly face and recovers from Quarantine Voice\u2122 enough to explain how this particular frustration led her to co-create <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/tv/reviews/mixedish-review-blackish-spinoff-abc-1203347524/\" title=\"\">Mixed-ish</a>, a prequel to Black-ish that debuted on ABC last year. While Bow\u2019s heritage was a comic sidenote in Black-ish, Mixed-ish centres it: Ross narrates the story of Bow\u2019s childhood, as the daughter of a black mother and white father growing up in 80s America. But there were mixed reviews, with some critics deeming the show\u2019s politics too <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/10/mixed-ish-thomas-chatterton-williams-race/600679/\" title=\"\">simplistic</a>, and it\u2019s not clear whether it will be back for a second season.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0362fe141a595da4018776a7af5fa57e407d6ff8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0362fe141a595da4018776a7af5fa57e407d6ff8/0_30_2889_2106/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Actor Tracee Ellis Ross, December 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"729\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018As a mixed person, you\u2019re constantly being bombarded by questions: are you this, or are you that?\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amar Daved/Art Partner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, there is one thing Ross has not yet turned her hand to in a long and varied career.

She runs her own company, <a href=\"https://patternbeauty.com/\" title=\"\">Pattern</a>, a successful haircare line for people with naturally curly hair. But there is one thing she has spent her entire life petrified of doing: becoming a singer. \u201cI have wanted to sing since I was a kid,\u201d she tells me. \u201cBut it was something I buried, because it was too scary a dream.\u201d There was, after all, a lot to live up to.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At 47, to go into a studio and discover I had a voice: that was life-changing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A year ago she landed a lead role in a movie.

Afraid of creating fresh material, Davis keeps trotting out old hits until her assistant (played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/dakota-johnson\" title=\"\">Dakota Johnson</a>) convinces her to record new work. Ross sings six original songs in the film, a dream come true for her. Then, all of a sudden, it was a dream deferred. The High Note was due to premiere in May; in an alternative, coronavirus-free universe, Ross would be crisscrossing the country on a busy promotion schedule. Now, she says, she\u2019s not sure if a premiere will ever happen. The film will be released, but nobody is quite sure when.</p> <p>A lot of people are dealing with much worse than cancelled movie premieres, she says. \u201cThis is a very small disappointment.\u201d But still, it stings. \u201cAt 47 years old, to go into the studio and start singing, and discover that I actually had a voice that could work\u2026 it was life-changing for me.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8de43decbd005a92ed30ae8100aba7da3cb1c1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8de43decbd005a92ed30ae8100aba7da3cb1c1b/0_0_2717_1811/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tracee Ellis Ross (in yellow dress) with (from left) Dakota Johnson, Ricky Martin and Ice Cube in the film The High Note , 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In The High Note, with Dakota Johnson, Ricky Martin and Ice Cube.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Planet Photos/Focus Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Did she really wait until 47 to start? \u201cPretty much. In high school, I took choir \u2013 it was one of the required courses \u2013 and we had to perform The Pirates Of Penzance. I was furious. I was so scared of singing in front of people that I marched myself to the headmaster\u2019s office: \u2018Mrs Regalman, I do not think that it\u2019s fair to force somebody who doesn\u2019t want to sing and who doesn\u2019t want to be on a stage to be on a stage.\u2019 And she told me I had to do it. So I did the play but I just mouthed the words.\u201d</p> <p>Ross sang in public a couple of times after that, but says she would always add \u201ca flare of comedy or hide behind a character\u201d. So it wasn\u2019t until very recently that she decided \u201cto face one of my biggest childhood fears. And, typical me, I didn\u2019t do it small \u2013 I decided to do it as the lead in a movie playing a musical diva.\u201d</p> <p>A couple of months ago, Ross unveiled a clip of her singing <a href=\"https://www.oprahmag.com/entertainment/a30950759/tracee-ellis-ross-oprah-2020-vision-tour/\" title=\"\">in the film, during an on-stage interview with Oprah Winfrey</a>. Curled up in her chair in an electric-blue suit, she looked on the verge of tears as the song, called Love Myself, played to a live audience. \u201cI had no memory of getting myself curled up in that chair until I looked over and saw the screen,\u201d she says. She wasn\u2019t the only emotional one: Oprah cried, too, and the audience applauded; Ross has a beautiful voice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d61d071899e70811541a631e0555acd5df31f6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d61d071899e70811541a631e0555acd5df31f6e/54_237_3767_2261/1000.jpg\" alt=\"(L-R) Rhonda Ross Kendrick, Callaway Lane, Chudney Ross, Evan Ross, Jagger Snow Ross, Diana Ross, host Tracee Ellis Ross, Raif-Henok Emmanuel Kendrick, Indigo Naess, Ross Naess, and Bronx Wentz pose in the press room during the 2017 American Music Awards at Microsoft Theater on November 19, 2017 in Los Angeles, California\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With her family, hosting the 2017 American music awards.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Granitz/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On-screen and off, she has spent much of her career challenging established narratives. She is often asked about her unmarried status, and has become a sort of accidental spokeswoman for the joy of being a single, childfree woman. The idea that being a woman means having a husband and kids is so deeply ingrained, she says, that most people don\u2019t even know how inappropriate they\u2019re being when they ask why she\u2019s not married. Strangers poking around in her uterus used to irritate her, but she doesn\u2019t \u201cmind any more. It no longer stings. It\u2019s just an opportunity for me to expand somebody\u2019s idea of the world and add something different. Women, particularly black and brown women, are told we should occupy a smaller area of real estate. Everything in my being and my career is about encouraging women to give themselves permission to take up the space. I am very comfortable making people uncomfortable. Not just for my own wellbeing, but hopefully so that other women don\u2019t have to bear that weight quite as heavily as my generation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dd08271114b90ced026aaf88cd47f94181839622\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd08271114b90ced026aaf88cd47f94181839622/86_200_1781_2761/645.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Ellis Silberstein aka Bob Ellis attends a movie with daughters (L) Rhonda and Tracee in 1975 in Los Angeles, California\" width=\"645\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With her father and sister Rhonda (left) in 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She remains \u201chappily and gloriously single\u201d, but that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t men in the background.

  "<p>My sister is a junior doctor in a big hospital. I don\u2019t have much to say about how work has been for her during the coronavirus pandemic, because she tells me nothing about it. Or, to be more specific, she tells me things are \u201cfine\u201d. This is how things are with us. I\u2019ve always held out my problems for all to see, dumping them on friends and any poor sod who happens to sit next to me on the train, like a dog presenting its latest kill from the garden. But my sister operates in a lower key, as my parents and I discovered when she casually mentioned one night in her early 20s that she had been held up at gunpoint a year or so ago. She hadn\u2019t thought to tell any of us at the time, because she didn\u2019t want to worry people and, honestly, she was fine.</p> <p>So I don\u2019t hear much about the goings on at hospital from her, but I don\u2019t really have to: I read about them in my newspaper every morning. Even aside from the whole global plague situation, which would be a big enough portion on any doctor\u2019s plate, there are the now notoriously dwindling supplies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/coronavirus-ppe-shortage-doctors-face-hard-decisions-on-whether-to-treat-patients\" title=\"\">of personal protective equipment</a>, or PPE. I\u2019d previously thought PPE was merely an acronym for Politics, Philosophy and Economics, one of those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/feb/23/ppe-oxford-university-degree-that-rules-britain\" title=\"\">weird Oxford degrees</a> studied by people who fantasise about running Britain one day.</p> <p>And perhaps that\u2019s what the people who run Britain thought, too, because they were rather cavalier about our supplies: we don\u2019t need any more PPE \u2013 we\u2019re already chock-full of those degrees! Except it turns out the other kind is quite useful and the government missed not one, not two, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/uk-missed-three-chances-to-join-eu-scheme-to-bulk-buy-ppe\" title=\"\">three chances to bulk-buy</a> it for healthcare workers. As a result, while EU doctors were getting \u00a31.3bn of PPE this month, NHS staff were being told to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/nhs-staff-to-be-asked-to-treat-coronavirus-patients-without-gowns\" title=\"\">make do with aprons</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/01/nhs-staff-making-masks-from-snorkels-amid-ppe-shortages\" title=\"\">snorkel masks</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/11/small-talk-and-ready-made-sandwiches-things-i-dont-miss-about-normal-life\">Small talk and ready-made sandwiches: things I don't miss about normal life | Hadley Freeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As I write, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/at-least-100-uk-health-workers-have-died-from-coronavirus-figures-show\" title=\"\">at least 100 NHS healthcare workers</a> have died from coronavirus. By the time you read this, it will be more. Doctors are now forced to make an impossible decision: continue doing their job and risk infecting themselves and their families, or walk away from their patients and colleagues. This is not a choice those of us who are related to healthcare workers can make for them, as much as we would like to.</p> <p>So what do we do, aside from lying awake at 3am, wide-eyed with the effort of trying not to think about worst-case scenarios? There are the rainbow paintings, of course, which my children duly made in the early days of lockdown and we hung in the front window, their aunt\u2019s name written in the sky. And there\u2019s the clapping \u2013 oh, the clapping. The first two weeks I enjoyed it, for the collective experience and the chance to check my neighbours are all OK. But as the news from hospitals has worsened, it has felt increasingly and pointlessly performative, something we all do because we don\u2019t know what the hell else to do. </p> <p>Maybe there is something more we can do, besides tweeting photos of ourselves applauding on our front steps. Wide awake at night, I often think of certain women, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/07/iraq.military\" title=\"\">Rose Gentle</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/aug/18/michael-fallon-apologises-family-dead-soldier-snatch-land-rover-delays\" title=\"\">Susan Smith</a>. You may not recognise their names, but they were a frequent presence in the media in the early years of this century. They lost sons in the Iraq war because, they said, the Ministry of Defence had failed to provide the British army with sufficient equipment. The Chilcot report later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/mod-left-uk-forces-in-iraq-ill-equipped-amid-lack-of-plan-chilcot-report-says\" title=\"\">backed them up</a>, saying that the armed forces had been put in danger due to \u201cwholly inadequate\u201d preparation, and the families successfully sued the MoD.</p> <p>Is that where all this will end? Because anyone with a brain can see that this is a scandal unfolding in real time, and that where the government neglected one public sector, it is now neglecting another. Some 179 British servicemen were killed<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10637526\" title=\"\"> in the invasion of Iraq</a>; we have already lost more than half that in the NHS \u2013 and doctors, unlike soldiers, are not called upon to risk death to do their job. Already the letters pages of newspapers are filled with messages from desperate families, terrified for relatives who went into healthcare in order to help others. And it\u2019s up to the families \u2013 us, me \u2013 to speak for them, given that NHS workers are being warned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/31/nhs-staff-gagged-over-coronavirus-protective-equipment-shortages\" title=\"\">by their employers not to speak to the media</a>.</p> <p>And so we stay at home, full of anxiety, knowing that whatever fears we have are nothing compared with what our relatives are going through on their daily rounds in hospital. We read the newspapers, and in our heads we are being ever so brave, proud of the risks our closest family members are taking. But in our hearts we desperately try to shut out the truth, and momentarily kid ourselves into believing our sisters, brothers, parents, children when they tell us that, honestly, everything\u2019s fine.</p>",

The Covid-19 outbreak has opened another chapter.</p> <p>After seven weeks in the slaughterhouses of Chicago, the journalist Upton Sinclair wrote The Jungle, a 1906 novel which described the grim conditions inside. \u201cThere were things that went into the sausage in comparison with which a poisoned rat was a tidbit,\u201d Sinclair wrote.</p> <p>The novel created a media frenzy and prompted the US government to investigate the industry. A wave of consumer protection laws followed.</p> <p>But these improvements masked the intent of Sinclair\u2019s novel: to highlight the exploitation of immigrant labor and unchecked greed. Sinclair famously declared: \u201cI aimed for the public\u2019s heart and by accident hit it in the stomach.\u201d</p> <p>Advanced industrialization and globalization after the second world war exacerbated the exploitation of workers. Instead of the Eastern European immigrants who staffed slaughterhouses at the turn of the century, by the 1970s these factories were filled with workers escaping conflict in South America and Asia. Production grew exponentially and labor unions lost power. Advances in worker safety could not keep up and today, working in a processing plant remains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/05/amputations-serious-injuries-us-meat-industry-plant\">one of the most dangerous jobs in the country</a>.</p> <p>The plight of Central American migrants in the meat industry was drawn into sharp focus last year when the Trump administration\u2019s immigration enforcement agency (Ice) carried out its largest raid in years on four poultry facilities in Mississippi. They arrested <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/08/us/mississippi-immigration-raids-children/index.html\">680 undocumented workers</a> but none of the companies, which included the multibillion dollar Koch Foods, faced any charges over employment practices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"224a626b5acd7fb0fb47e6856869b8b7ba3062cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/224a626b5acd7fb0fb47e6856869b8b7ba3062cf/0_276_3550_2129/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Poultry workers inside a Fieldale Farms chicken processing plant in Gainesville, Georgia, USA, 27 April 2020.

Life is short. Enjoy it.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/09/debate-over-nmes-heyday\">Writing in the NME</a>, Paul Morley once described Coronation Street\u2019s loafer-in-chief, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Ogden\">Stan Ogden</a>, as \u201ca man who could see the whole world in a fried egg sandwich\u201d.

Using a circular container such as <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2009/09/fried-egg-sandwich-recipe.html\">an English muffin</a> (think of the potential overhang) or worse a bagel (gaping hole + runny yolk = tragicomic disaster) is baffling.

There is no need to create a textural contrast between crisp toast and soft egg. On the contrary, the comfort-food essence of a fried egg sandwich \u2013 nursery food for the never-nannied classes \u2013 lies in how it yields so easily as you bite into it. It should offer a lack of resistance in subtly differentiated layers so easy to penetrate you could gum your way through it without your teeth in. Generic white sliced bread \u2013 floppy, plasticised, woolly and unreal \u2013 is the way to go. And \u201cnone of that brown stuff\u201d, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2004/jul/11/foodanddrink.features6\">Peter Stringfellow</a> rightly insists.</p> <p>Opting for white sliced bread is not solely about texture and flavour (the bread acting as a bland delivery vehicle for its rich dairy partner*), but also feel and practicality. With a little pressure from the palm of your hand, thin slices of squishy bread will mould around the hot, slippery egg to form a malleable, manageable, partially sealed pocket, in which everything is securely contained. Such bread allows you to relax. Everything in that sandwich is under control.</p> <p>*On the rich dairy front, a fried egg sandwich should be buttered as surely as bears enjoy secluded, woodland toilet spots. If you cannot see teeth marks in the butter, if melted butter is not spotting your plate in the style of Jackson Pollock, you are doing it wrong.</p> <h2><strong>Flip v</strong><strong> drip</strong></h2> <p>The greatest schism in the fried egg community is between the chosen few who flip the egg and fry the yolk until it is verging on solid (over-medium approaching over-hard in <a href=\"https://www.thekitchn.com/whats-the-difference-eggs-over-easy-vs-sunny-side-up-96069\">US diner lingo</a>) and those heretics and heathens who leave the yolk runny.</p> <p>The soft yolk serve is mystifying. Even if (correctly) you do not cut your sandwich, eventually you will bite into that runny yolk and it will leak, nay spurt and gush forth, if not down your chin and over your fingers then to coagulate on cold porcelain, where it will set like an ugly stain on your psyche \u2013 a hideous reminder of your casual waste. The only people who want golden yolk seeping on to plates are food stylists on fried egg sandwich shoots. Unless you are going to suck hideously at your sandwich like a teat, a full, tremulous yolk poised to explode is pointless jeopardy.</p> <p>Instead, you need that yolk barely set, still fudgy, residually runny at its very centre, but only to the extent that any leakage can be quickly gobbled down or absorbed by the surrounding bread. That state is a matter of seconds cooking on the flip.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The inclusion of any salad items is symptomatic of a self-loathing that requires psychiatric intervention</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some of the biggest names in the egg game favour a third way. Halfway through, they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/mar/27/20-best-recipes-meals-for-one-linguine-clams-egg-sandwich-nigella-lawson\">deliberately split and spread out the yolk </a>before flipping the egg, to ensure you get some cooked yolk in each bite. \u201cIt results in its own unique flavour, different from both scrambled eggs and a fried egg,\u201d <a href=\"https://food52.com/blog/10207-michael-ruhlman-s-weekend-broken-yolk-fried-egg-sandwich\">reckons Michael Ruhlman, the author of Egg</a>, whose slightly different method involves putting two eggs in a ramekin first, gently breaking the yolks with his finger, then pouring them into a hot pan. But HTE is unconvinced. It prefers to retain the thick yolk in its intact state. It should be waiting for you at the centre of the sandwich, anticipation building as you eat towards the pronounced alteration in the nature of the sandwich that it delivers.</p> <p>That is not to say the yolk is the best part of the sandwich. HTE does not buy the yolk &gt; white hierarchy. Given that <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bKVCtH4AjwgC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;dq=%2B%2260%25%22+%2B%22mcgee%22+%2B%22yolk%22+%2B%22egg%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qYOKckO6tc&amp;sig=ACfU3U0hG8PWbVJaKJrc7wVGdWuQEKfZXQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjjsJCptIvpAhVeURUIHT50A_YQ6AEwCnoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%2B%2260%25%22%20%2B%22mcgee%22%20%2B%22yolk%22%20%2B%22egg%22&amp;f=false\">more than 60% of an egg\u2019s calories</a> are found in the yolk, HTE assumes we are genetically programmed to crave it. But its assumed superiority is a fallacy, a subjective trick of the obedient mind rather than an objective fact.</p> <p>Food writing is full of nauseatingly twee or pompous hymns to the velvety richness of egg yolks. By dint of its relative scarcity, the yolk is considered luxurious while the white is disregarded as workaday. HTE loves both, but, if forced to choose, the creamy white definitely edges it. On days when the yolk can seem cloying, there is still something irresistible about that sweet albumen, its tensile resistance between the teeth and the way its subtle flavour forms a holy trinity with bread and butter.</p> <p>Perhaps it is down to how your palate was formed. If from an early age your life was filled with gilt-edged gastronomic adventure, you may feel a pampered fealty to the yolk. If you are used to a plainer, cheaper diet, the white already tastes like a heaven-sent treat. HTE is not saying that a preference for yolk or white is the ultimate class divide. But nor is it saying that it isn\u2019t.</p> <p>As the soft, curvaceous smoothness of that white is precious, please do not ruin it by radically overcooking your egg. Fried eggs with crispy, browned frills, their edges like hardened melted plastic, are terrible. Better an undercooked white than burnt edges.</p> <h2><strong>Additions</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30ce860865e94c6a3df5db3f7e7b63090ec2d98c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30ce860865e94c6a3df5db3f7e7b63090ec2d98c/0_304_3024_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fried egg sandwich with tomato ketchup.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The vinegary twang of ketchup makes it the most acceptable condiment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tornadoflight/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a self-serving narrative implicit in food journalism (there are pages to fill, magazines to sell \u2026 or at least there used to be), that food is in a constant process of refinement and improvement, in pursuit of a forever-delayed perfection. We can never accept what we have, much less suggest subtracting ingredients from dishes. Simplicity does not sell. Every food must, by endless add-ons and ever-greater complexity, be elevated to its \u201cnext-level\u201d, \u201cdeluxe\u201d or \u201cultimate\u201d manifestation.</p> <p>Consequently, people are always adding ingredients to the fried egg sandwich (blue cheese, <a href=\"https://www.chowhound.com/recipes/california-style-fried-egg-breakfast-sandwich-31642\">avocado</a>, bacon jam, kimchi, bechamel, anchovy paste, rocket, ham, possibly all at the same time), which ruins the whole concept. What if, and HTE is just throwing this out there, the \u201cbest ever\u201d fried egg sandwich was ... a fried egg sandwich? One made with the best egg you can buy, enjoyed without distraction?</p> <p>Add some cheap, crispy bacon if you must (as a textural fillip, as seasoning), but why waste great bacon here? Savour it on its own. Similarly, a fried egg sandwich does not require additional sliced cheddar, which, as those slices soften but fail to melt, will morph into a gummy unsatisfying paste. Note: the inclusion of any salad items, such as sliced tomato, is symptomatic of a self-loathing that requires psychiatric intervention.</p> <p>A condiment is acceptable. If judiciously applied, tomato sauce is the most obvious contender, its sharp vinegary twang a counterpoint to the dairy. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2015/jan/05/-sp-brown-sauce-sales-are-falling-has-britain-finally-come-to-its-senses\">HTE considers brown sauce a terrible creation</a>, but, in this case, it is less egregious than mayonnaise (appalling flavour profile on hot sandwiches), mustard (only acceptable if you smoke 40 a day) or hot sauce, the use of which on all foods, no matter how unsuitable, is now a kind of mass hysteria.</p> <h2><strong>When</strong></h2> <p>From drunken, ravenous 4am feasts (remember them?) to moments of 4pm ennui, the fried egg sandwich fits.

Yet the impact on millions, particularly those living on the edge in daily informal labour has been acute.</p> <p>Amid limited government support, an outpouring of hundreds of initiatives has emerged across Lagos, providing food and essential goods.

These donations are sent to their home and packaged and delivered on weekends.</p> <p>\u201cWe were feeding around 570-600 families each time we went out, in the space of around three or four streets,\u201d says Wober. \u201cSince the lockdown we deliver to about 1,000.\u201d</p> <p>The group, now called Feed The Streets Lagos, keeps records of the locations, size and specific needs of the families they give aid to. \u201cAfter a while we got to know these people, so we could better understand their needs,\u201d says Ogunsulire. \u201d</p> <p>Lagos\u2019 government says it has provided \u201cfood stimulus packages\u201d to 250,000 people, and cash transfers to a further 250,000, out of the city\u2019s 22 million people.</p> <p>Nigeria\u2019s government is providing support to the poorest 3.6 million people, in payments of up to 20,000 naira ($51) a month.</p> <p>Yet the support only scratches the surface.

You can have food but no cooking oil. You can have cooking oil but no fuel. You can be able to eat but not have water or other really vital needs.\u201d</p> <p>Ten days into lockdown, Noella Nwakwesi, an interior designer, noticed several people in her neighbourhood in Lekki holding placards saying: \u201cI am hungry\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"290bb254069bfeb36fe35bc6c1646444c87caf59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/290bb254069bfeb36fe35bc6c1646444c87caf59/0_263_6240_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Residents make use of the food bank in Oniru.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Residents make use of the food bank in Oniru.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Grace Ekpu/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe numbers were growing everyday,\u201d says Nwakwesi, who formed the Lekki Food Bank.</p> <p>Volunteers made up of young professionals, including bankers, consultants and pastors, distribute roughly 1,000 meals a day and 500 packages of dry food and water.</p> <p>Six days a week, by midday long queues stretch into empty streets, each person standing along chalked markings on the road, with police standing by enforcing social distancing.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been humbled by the donations,\u201d Nwakwesi says. \u201cWe have a long-term goal to combat specifically food insecurity in our local communities.\u201d</p> <p>Other groups like the Lagos Food Bank existed before the lockdown started, building on existing systems, donations and partnerships.</p> <p>Fast food and manufacturing companies have donated food packages and face masks.

A medical team at locations where help is distributed provides check-ups for locals.</p> <p>The Coalition Against Covid-19 (CACovid) is the most high-profile private sector initiative to emerge in recent weeks. The group, led by three Nigerian billionaires, has pledged 23 billion naira ($59m) to provide food aid for 10 million Nigerians.</p> <p>Yet help has also been highly individual.</p> <p>Fighting restlessness amid the hours under lockdown, multimedia artist Taiye Idahor dug out sewing instruments that she\u2019d long abandoned in storage.

Jos\u00e9 poses in a landmine helmet, England\u2019s rose steering us through these dark, unmonetised, content-poor times.</p> \n<p>Probably this is just me. But in fairness, it has been slim pickings out there. The suspension of the match programme is one thing. The most notable co-casualty of the plague times is the absence of the endless football-style content that rides alongside: the lifestyle, the brand, the lucrative sense of belonging, a definition of football that has allowed certain Premier League clubs to state, with supporting commercial evidence, that they have a billion fans around the world, that they are in fact too big to fail.</p> \n<p>It is easy to forget this side of the business has also been scythed off at the knees. Right now eyeballs are no longer eyeballing. Clicks are unclicked. Needs, desires and disposable income are focused elsewhere. And the absence of this shadow industry is perhaps just as significant, at least for those clubs that rely on it to an unusual degree.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9b85317a-89a0-4171-9e43-9f96feb62f57\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>At which point, enter Manchester United. Or rather, enter \u201cManchester United\u201d. For the past seven years the endless growth of the United brand has been one of sport\u2019s gravity-defying miracles, a marvel of the age. How do you kill this thing? How do you stop it rising and spreading? Throw what you like at it. A full season of migraine-inducing Mourinho death-ball. A foul-tempered home defeat to a peppy Southampton on a freezing afternoon inside a clanky rain-drenched stadium followed by a half an hour of finger-jabbing post-match bile. It makes no difference. Switch the channel and Manchester United plc are still announcing record revenues, still bathing in an apparently insatiable appetite for its red-shirted commercial voodoo.</p> \n<p>And yet, there are no miracles really. Nobody really knows what the short-, medium- or long-term future might hold. What is certain is this is a stress test of something unprecedented. United\u2019s commercial arm has been breathtakingly successful at monetising the era-building of the previous 20 years. They have been hanging on to a rising balloon, \u00a3400m in debt but still clawing in cash to keep the engines thrumming forward.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"203e605214d51580482242ee4926f4e48e2e3568\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/203e605214d51580482242ee4926f4e48e2e3568/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Old Trafford\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018United\u2019s commercial arm has been breathtakingly successful at monetising the era-building of the previous 20 years.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nigel French/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>No other club is set up quite like this. It is a model predicated on constant growth, constant momentum. What happens when it crashes? More to the point, does this actually have to be a bad thing? So far there have been attempts to suggest large debts and reduced income isn\u2019t a problem. Perhaps correctly so. It has been pointed out by people who know this world that United have such ready access to credit they can simply borrow more without it being a problem. There is also a suggestion the reliance on commercial income actually puts them in a better place than other clubs. This version of the future states that the Official Brassiere Partner model is a huge advantage, a diversification of income to insulate the club against the absence of actual football.</p> \n<p>Does this sound convincing? The mathematics are certainly fascinating. One detailed projection in the Daily Mail has United losing \u00a3116m in commercial, TV and matchday revenue if the season is cancelled now, the most of any club. But why not more?</p> \n<p>The notion sponsors will keep propping this up is untested. There is already talk elsewhere of discounts. United\u2019s \u201cpartners\u201d are taking huge hits of their own. Those contracts will have force majeure clauses, or be open to frustration principles under common law. The Glazer family\u2019s own main business is based on vast areas of physical retail space in the US. Good luck with that one. Excess commercial deals, endless sloshing cash: this just isn\u2019t going to be there any more.</p> \n<p>This is an industry-wide problem. But United are the most extreme <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/17/glazers-legacy-manchester-united-liverpool\">debt-loaded commercial model</a> out there, a buy-to-let landlord in the middle of a rent revolt. Wages topped \u00a3300m last year. Encouragingly, debt repayments are a mere \u00a326m. But still: extend the match-staging restrictions into next season and the losses start to become vertiginous. Ever wondered why there is such an urgency to resume playing? Why we have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/29/premier-leagues-project-restart-what-is-it-and-is-it-feasible\">Project Restart</a> looming, a strangely menacing prospect that sounds less like a \u201cfestival of football\u201d, more like a doomed 1980s burglar rehabilitation initiative.

It is no secret the Glazers are terrible owners from one perspective. Fantastic for the commercial operation, yes, but there is no love here, no sense of sporting soul, no real interest in the intangible things \u2013 collectivism, sporting culture, coherent long-term planning \u2013 that built this super-club in the first place.</p> \n<p>This is an ownership that has ridden a rising tide, squatting on the shoulders of a grand old footballing institution. Many have wondered how United will ever escape this cycle of vampiric, debt-loaded ownership. In practice the only way is to become less attractive, less endlessly fecund. Contraction, brand collapse, revolution: whatever happens there will always be a Manchester United. In the meantime, here\u2019s your earthquake.</p>",

  "<p>For fans of televised sport, there will always be that golden Sunday, in July last year, when the broadcast of a topsy-turvy Wimbledon final overlapped with a British Grand Prix <em>and</em> England\u2019s blockbuster victory in the Cricket World Cup. Oh my Djokovic: an unimprovable time to be an armchair spectator, an afternoon of channel-hopping and ad-dodging, hurrying wees and tea brews, juggling screens and streams and replays till we sweated like athletes ourselves.</p> <p>Unthinkable, then, that 10 months on, the sport schedules would be empty. Wimbledon 2020 is off. The cricket season has been picked apart. Everything from motorsport to football to darts has been put on hold while the world deals with coronavirus.</p> <p>What are we left with? How are fans, broadcasters and sportspeople themselves coping with the dearth of live competition on TV? On a recent Sunday evening, the hero of last summer\u2019s Cricket World Cup, Ben Stokes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/02/england-cricketer-ben-stokes-signs-up-to-race-in-virtual-f1-grand-prix\" title=\"\">agreed to take part in a virtual </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/02/england-cricketer-ben-stokes-signs-up-to-race-in-virtual-f1-grand-prix\" title=\"\">grand </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/02/england-cricketer-ben-stokes-signs-up-to-race-in-virtual-f1-grand-prix\" title=\"\">prix</a> that was broadcast at primetime on Sky. It was a kind of high-end Mario Kart that, with some squinting, looked almost as good as the real thing. But it was fatally devoid of risk. The seriousness of the contest never fully recovered after a restless Stokes started speeding backwards around the track, colliding with drivers coming the other way. One of the cars was piloted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/02/liam-payne-on-life-after-one-direction-it-was-touch-and-go-i-was-slowly-losing-the-plot\">Liam Payne</a>. I decided then that virtual sports were not going to cut it for me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21e33be58446138d07dbc1a081817de76cf75497\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21e33be58446138d07dbc1a081817de76cf75497/37_0_1258_728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Screen shot of cricketer Ben Stokes taking part in a virtual grand prix on Sky in April\" width=\"1000\" height=\"579\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Stokes taking part in a virtual grand prix in April. Will he catch Jenson Button?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: F1 Esports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For a while I managed my cravings for sports programming \u2013 15 hours a week, pre-pandemic \u2013 by taking in a diet of football documentaries, season-in-review DVDs and YouTube clips of outrageous or obscure goals from years gone by. A striker for Brighton, I remembered, vaguely, had scored a last-minute <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/8370901/glenn-murrays-nods-in-winner-with-his-crotch-as-brighton-see-off-west-brom-in-fa-cup-replay/\">goal with his penis</a> in 2019. I watched the clip several times.</p> <p>The documentaries were more nourishing, especially the multi-hour Netflix series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/27/sunderlands-til-i-die-second-series-fans-stress-spanners-dismay\">Sunderland \u2019Til I Die</a> that charted, in immaculate turn-by-turn detail, the fortunes of the north-east club as it moved between the lower leagues. Viewers were introduced to fans for whom watching footie was more than just a diversion, it was a crutch. I was especially taken by a diehard called Michelle Barraclough who hadn\u2019t missed a Sunderland game in years.</p> <p>I called up Barraclough, one afternoon, to ask how she was coping. She\u2019d watched something like 20 hours of live sport a week, before the lockdown, and had now gone a fortnight without. The country\u2019s response to the coronavirus, she told me, had made her question her hero-worship of footballers in the past. \u201cFootball feels very small in the grand scheme of things,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople can\u2019t see their families. I haven\u2019t seen my five-year-old granddaughter since the lockdown started. If I told anyone, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m missing the football,\u2019 they\u2019d probably give me a slap.\u201d</p> <p>There was a pause. But are you missing the football, I asked? \u201cOh <em>God,</em> yeah,\u201d she said. \u201cMassively. Massively.\u201d</p> <p>I was, too. I\u2019d heard there were armchair fans out there who were looking east for their fix. Leagues had been suspended in England, Scotland, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. But not in Belarus, where the Premier League season kicked off in late March. A team from the outskirts of Minsk called Energetik (they\u2019d been rechristened to honour the Belarusian state energy company) won the opening game of the season 3-1. Energetik then went on to beat the incumbent league champions and had a chance to go top of the league, if they could beat their local rivals, Minsk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b8549ba9cac95bd03328d1930326093a763b800b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8549ba9cac95bd03328d1930326093a763b800b/0_783_2362_1447/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of a table tennis bat with  a ball shaped like a cornovarius\" width=\"1000\" height=\"613\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018An afternoon of Ukrainian table tennis was like watching events from space.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Gym Class/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I watched the derby live. Energetik scored in the first half. They had a player sent off in the second. They won the game in injury time, their goalie running the length of the pitch to celebrate with his teammates while, at my end, in my bedroom in London, I gave my laptop a celebratory waggle and clicked to close the small pop-up window I\u2019d been watching in. One of the gambling websites, Bet365, held streaming rights to the Belarusian league and this was the only way to watch along: a square of video the size of a couple of postage stamps, surrounded by flashing sports odds and gaudy ads for an Irish-themed casino game called Spin O\u2019Reely.</p> <p>Production-wise, it wasn\u2019t quite what I was used to: there was no commentary, only the sound of huffing players and (crystal clear) the Energetik coach screaming angry criticism at his players and the ref. Even so, I found myself looking forward to the next round of fixtures, in a week\u2019s time.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re watching football from Belarus? Getting your hit wherever you can find it, eh? You\u2019re like someone who\u2019s run out of single malt whiskey and has started drinking hand sanitiser.\u201d This was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/09/james-o-brien-interview-lbc\">James O\u2019Brien, the LBC radio presenter</a>, who I\u2019d called up at home. O\u2019Brien, who used to watch about eight hours of live sport a week, was one of the first to wonder aloud what its absence would be doing to the nation\u2019s mental health, and I was curious to know how he was managing. \u201cI\u2019m not watching Belarusian football, no,\u201d said O\u2019Brien, \u201cbut there is a massive gap that\u2019s been left and nothing is quite filling it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c783825a8551aa6753602c83f015f7b679fa5c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c783825a8551aa6753602c83f015f7b679fa5c1/0_25_4336_2921/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In this photo taken on Thursday, March 19, 2020, players are in action during the Belarus Championship soccer match between Energetik-BGU and Bate in Minsk, Belarus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Energetik take on Minsk in the Belarus Premier League in March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sergei Grits/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On his radio show, he said, he was hearing from dozens of people every day as they described their lives in this strange and unsettling period. \u201cAnd this has really come across to me, speaking to people, how hard it has been to find moments of mental space. I see now that sport was one of those doorways to a clear mind. I realise what value it had, emotionally. Because there was the distraction of the sport itself \u2013 but, almost as important, there was the comfort and reassurance that the sport was <em>there</em>.\u201d He said he still found himself flicking to \u201cthe 400s\u201d \u2013 the sports channels on Sky \u2013 just in case.</p> <p>What else was still showing live on TV and online? There was Australian horse racing, but it didn\u2019t start till the middle of the night. Malaysian volleyball? Russian ice hockey? I settled, in the end, for an afternoon of Ukrainian table tennis, following the progress of a pale and furious young player called Vadim Smetenko, who happened to be on a winning streak that day. The physically distanced players squeaked around a leisure centre, footage of the matches shot using a fixed camera above the table, the sound coming in and out, and the feed occasionally rippling with distortion. It was all a little like watching events from space.</p> <p>Soon it was time to watch Energetik play their next fixture. It was a bleak affair, and not only because they were beaten 2-0 by a team called Torpedo. \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d O\u2019Brien had said, \u201cthat Belarusian football is a market you want to be supporting at the moment. What, have they discovered something about coronavirus the rest of us haven\u2019t?\u201d He was right. Belarus was currently the only country in Europe with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/29/belarus-football-continues-coronavirus-premier-league\" title=\"\">an active football competition</a>. The country did not seem to have any special handle on the problem of coronavirus; its sports administrators had just decided to carry on regardless. The country\u2019s president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/alexander-lukashenko\">Alexander Lukashenko</a>, made the questionable claim that sport should not only be allowed to continue but that<strong> </strong>it \u201cis the best <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2020/mar/29/there-are-no-viruses-here-belarus-president-plays-ice-hockey-amid-covid-19-pandemic-video\">anti-virus remedy</a>\u201d. The chief of Fifpro, the world footballers\u2019 union, had described the situation as \u201cnot comprehendible\u201d. Wishing Energetik well, I decided to let the Belarusian Premier League carry on without me.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Watching sport, you can be irrational, or elated, or fuming angry, or goosebumpy. And that\u2019s why we need it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A handful of other hold-out sports bodies had been refusing to bow to the pandemic. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ufc\">Ultimate Fighting Championship</a>, a mixed martial arts competition based in the US, was preparing to build a ring on a remote private island, in order to avoid stay-at-home orders and continue staging bouts. The pro-wrestling federation, <a href=\"https://www.wwe.com/\">WWE</a>, had somehow secured \u201cessential\u201d business status from a sympathetic governor in Florida and would thus be able to continue some degree of live broadcasting. Other sports sought to push through the lockdown in a milder way, embracing the challenges posed by the moment and tweaking their rules and settings to become isolation-friendly.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCygUhvsu653-ldNvT4Wr_pw\" title=\"\">They were putting on internet darts</a>, for instance. A group of top players had agreed to play from their homes, with a webcam pointed at their dartboards, earpieces telling them when to throw, a tablet showing the scores, and two referees watching along on Zoom. The results were broadcast in split-screen on YouTube.</p> <p>And I tried to love it. I so admired internet darts, for the effort involved, and the example being set. But all I was really watching was a pair of physically distanced dartboards and the jerky appearance of arrows that had been thrown by an invisible hand.</p> <p>Meanwhile I\u2019d been learning a lot about the anatomy of a sports obsession. To be properly compelling, I knew now, sport had to be live. It had to have consequences. And it had to be human. I wanted to watch human achievement, but more than that I wanted to watch humans achieving.</p> <p>Perhaps I would find what I was missing in the world of basketball. The sport\u2019s governing body, <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/\">the NBA</a>, had organised a stay-at-home free-throw competition, with male and female pros competing against each other from their gardens and driveways while a studio host kept score. They leapt about. They chuntered and teased each other, completing nifty, unlikely throws from all angles until one of them triumphed. I didn\u2019t have the right subscription channel to see the action as it happened, so I found the replays online and followed along as if they were live \u2013 squinting where necessary to avoid accidentally discovering the results in the page furniture, and eventually leaning a book against the bottom of my screen to hide the absolute spoiler pit that was the comments section.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0a3acb7287970f7e4df7ce0965f6dd23a65aba2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a3acb7287970f7e4df7ce0965f6dd23a65aba2f/0_100_2362_2133/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of  hand with finger up, balancing a baseball shaped like a cornovarius\" width=\"1000\" height=\"903\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Perhaps I would find what I was missing in the world of basketball.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Gym Class/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Epiphany! If I could enjoy a backyard basketball competition (watched on delay, cowering from spoilers, simulating live conditions), why not a historical sporting contest with some more meat on the bone? I messaged friends whose knowledge of American sports went anorak-deep. What had I missed in recent seasons? What was out there, online, that I was ignorant of and could watch as if it were live? We put together a bill of fare, plucking the better games from three major American sports. A starter of ice hockey (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x18EQERgJQ\">Maple Leafs v</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x18EQERgJQ\"> Flyers</a>), a main of basketball (<a href=\"https://www.nba.com/playoffs/2019/finals#/\">Raptors v</a><a href=\"https://www.nba.com/playoffs/2019/finals#/\"> Warriors</a>), baseball for pudding (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/oct/30/world-series-game-7-washington-nationals-v-houston-astros-live\">Nationals v</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/oct/30/world-series-game-7-washington-nationals-v-houston-astros-live\"> Astros</a>). It took hours to consume all this hand-picked good stuff. There was an epic penalty shootout. Two celebratory confetti showers! But something was off.</p> <p>When I knew to expect grand drama, I was impatient for it, and I started fast-forwarding for the sexy bits. Any thrills did not feel earned, and it occurred to me for the first time that one of the perverse appeals of live sport might be the obligatory waiting \u2013 all that hanging around for a result to land, worrying it might wind up being a hideous waste of time.</p> <p>\u201cSport speaks to the drama of the unknown,\u201d the president of Eurosport, Andrew Georgiou, told me. \u201cWe hope for something. But we don\u2019t know we\u2019re going to get it.\u201d At the outbreak of the crisis, as sport wound down and stopped, Eurosport lost something like 2,500 hours of planned-for live footage for the spring. Georgiou and his team had to hustle to fill the gaps with archive material and virtual sports. \u201cI\u2019m looking at my calendar for the week,\u201d he said, \u201cand everything\u2019s planned. I know exactly what I\u2019m doing every minute of the week. Live sport allows you to escape from the predictability of [that] and get into untold drama\u2026 The very reason I watch sport is because of that massive unpredictability.\u201d</p> <p>I agreed, and I found myself drifting back to the Ukrainian table tennis. Smetenko had won three thrillers in a row. There was something about knowing he was out there, swearing, squeaking in his trainers, that made him a more compelling watch than all the confetti-showered basketballers and baseballers put together.</p> <p>Taiwanese baseball. Tajik football. The search continued. I had to ask myself the serious question: if the UFC was successful in staging a brutal ultimate fight on a private island, would I be desperate enough to pay to watch? Katherine Brunt, a World Cup-winning England cricketer and former devourer of TV sport (12 hours a week), told me she had been wondering the same thing. She had always been a fan of mixed martial arts in her former, sport-watching life. The prospect of a fresh, live bout would be hard to resist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bc2b0f8809156e60b0d7b8a2623da3a3474a2f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bc2b0f8809156e60b0d7b8a2623da3a3474a2f1/0_153_4300_2579/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katherine Brunt (c) and Anya Shrubsole (r) of England Women celebrate England men winning the Final of the ICC Cricket World Cup against New Zealand during Day Three of the International Friendly match between England Women and Australia A Women at Millfield School on July 14, 2019 in Glastonbury, England.

I heartily agreed. Like gourmands reminiscing over some old, closed-down restaurant, we traded memories about that golden Sunday of TV sport last summer. While Stokes led the England men\u2019s team to glory, Brunt said, she had been watching on a TV with her teammates, after a match of their own. \u201cWe\u2019d just played Australia. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/jul/31/womens-ashes-england-v-australia-third-final-t20-live-cricket\">Absolutely spanked them</a>.\u201d But do you know what, Brunt added? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-win-cricket-world-cup-and-for-once-the-nation-really-was-watching\">Watching the men\u2019s team win</a> on TV was almost better.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re playing, you can\u2019t let your emotions get the best of you. You have to almost turn your real feelings down a bit. When you\u2019re watching sport, though, you can let it <em>all</em> out.\u201d There happened to be a photographer on site that day, and he captured Brunt, in a moment of spectator-sport bliss, overturning the nearest chair. \u201cWatching sport, you can be irrational, or elated, or fuming angry, or goosebumpy,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we need it.\u201d</p> <p>She said goodbye. Off, maybe, to watch some fight clips on YouTube. I had a choice to make myself, between Swedish horse racing and the next round of internet darts.

And at a time when many of us are working from home and running up bills during the day, this is likely to be their biggest selling point.</p> <h2><strong>Thermostats</strong></h2> <p>Smart thermostats can be used to control your heating remotely by a smartphone app. Popular features include building a schedule based on your habits, turning down the heating when no one is home and multi-room control.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3db656250b37a3332daf63d9726da1b7635c619\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3db656250b37a3332daf63d9726da1b7635c619/0_0_4185_2511/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nest learning thermostat review - scheduler app\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Nest smart thermostat is one of the most popular, and can be scheduled via an app.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are loads of smart thermostats to choose from. The Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation (from about \u00a3160) and Hive Active Heating (from about \u00a3129) are among the most popular.</p> <p>The Tado V3+ Smart Thermostat costs from about \u00a395. The company claims it can reduce your energy bill by 31%. The average annual bill for a medium-sized house is \u00a31,163 (according to Octopus Energy) \u2013 so that\u2019s a saving of \u00a3360.</p> <p>Smart thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs) can also reduce your heating costs. These allow you to remotely control temperatures on a room-by-room basis \u2013 you will need to attach a valve to each radiator. Some smart TRVs work on a standalone basis, while others work with a smart thermostat.</p> <p>As an example, one Radbot Smart TRV costs from about \u00a335. Radbot estimates payback of your initial outlay in 11 months based on a 30% saving on heating bills.</p> <h2><strong>Lighting</strong></h2> <p>Households looking to save money on lighting costs should probably look to switch to LED bulbs rather than splashing out on smart lighting. According to SimplyLED, 20,000 hours of lighting costs \u00a325.80 if you use old-style filament bulbs, but just \u00a35.40 if you use an LED bulb.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43da88a261acbd32e31f3a18c277cadb49e38aaa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43da88a261acbd32e31f3a18c277cadb49e38aaa/119_79_1381_829/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philips Hue smart lightbulb kit\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philips Hue smart lightbulb kits start from\u00a3 50 to \u00a360.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phiiips</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But smart lighting systems are undeniably cool, offering mood lighting, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/23/alexa-lights-how-i-turned-my-home-into-a-sci-fi-dream\" title=\"\">voice control via a smart assistant</a> (such as Google Assistant or Alexa), plus the ability to turn lights on and off remotely. </p> <p>Philips Hue is widely regarded as one of the best smart lighting systems. You can get a starter kit including the Philips Hue bridge (which you connect to your router) and two bulbs for about \u00a350-\u00a360. Extra bulbs start from about \u00a315.</p> <h2><strong>Safety gadgets</strong></h2> <p>If you spend all day worrying you have left your hair straighteners or the iron on, a smart plug is worth buying, as it means you can turn off the socket from your phone. Smart plugs cost from \u00a315; the popular Hive Active Plug is available for about \u00a331.</p> <p>Water sensors and leak alarms can stop a minor leak becoming a catastrophe. The idea is to catch burst pipes, leaking showers and so on early to minimise the damage.</p> <p>Research by leak alarm firm LeakBot found that the average insurance claim for escape of water is more than \u00a32,500 \u2013 a significant amount if you have cover, and a huge cost if you don\u2019t.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f66dc421686f0ea35ea92870779cced0f1826a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f66dc421686f0ea35ea92870779cced0f1826a3/0_21_5700_3420/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Smiling retired senior male using smart phone while sitting with dog in room at home\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smart doorbells stream live video to your phone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maskot/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The usual retail price of a LeakBot is \u00a3149, but the company is currently running a promotion on Amazon\u2019s UK site where you can buy one for \u00a329.

  "<p>The British government is quietly seeking access to the European Union\u2019s pandemic warning system, despite early reluctance to cooperate on health after Brexit, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>The UK is seeking \u201csomething akin to membership\u201d of the EU\u2019s early warning and response system (EWRS), which has played a critical role in coordinating Europe\u2019s response to the coronavirus, as well as to earlier pandemics such as bird flu. According to an EU source, this would be \u201cpretty much the same\u201d as membership of the system.</p> <p>The government\u2019s enthusiasm in the privacy of the negotiating room contrasts with noncommittal public statements. <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/868874/The_Future_Relationship_with_the_EU.pdf\">Detailed negotiating objectives</a> published in February merely stated that the UK was \u201copen to exploring cooperation between the UK and EU in other specific and narrowly defined areas where this is in the interest of both sides, for example on matters of health security\u201d.</p> <p>Health was not even mentioned <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2020-02-03/HCWS86/\">in the government\u2019s written statement to Parliament</a>, aside from a reference to pharmaceuticals.

They are keen and they are keen to be seen to be keen. Both sides want close cooperation.\u201d</p> <p>However, the EU is not prepared to offer the UK full membership of the EWRS, an online platform set up in 1998 where public authorities share information about health emergencies.</p> <p>Instead, EU officials propose to \u201cplug the UK into\u201d the system when a pandemic emerges, similar to arrangements for other non-EU countries.</p> <p>Health security does not feature in the UK negotiating text sent in private to the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, although EU officials have received a \u201cnon-paper\u201d outlining government aims on health.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Covid-19%3A%20help%20us%20investigate&amp;description=The%20Guardian%20is%20investigating%20how%20the%20UK%20government%20prepared%20for%20%E2%80%93%20and%20is%20responding%20to%20%E2%80%93%20the%20coronavirus%20pandemic.%20We%20want%20to%20learn%20more%20about%20recent%20decisions%20taken%20at%20the%20heart%20of%20government.%20If%20you%E2%80%99re%20a%20whistleblower%20or%20source%20and%20with%20new%20information%2C%20you%20can%20email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Acovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Ecovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20(using%20a%20non-work%20phone)%20use%20Signal%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447584640566%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566.%20(The%20number%20does%20not%20take%20calls.)%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E.%20For%20general%20advice%20on%20confidentially%20contacting%20the%20Guardian%2C%20see%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.%20&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"Investigations\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Covid-19%3A%20help%20us%20investigate&description=The%20Guardian%20is%20investigating%20how%20the%20UK%20government%20prepared%20for%20%E2%80%93%20and%20is%20responding%20to%20%E2%80%93%20the%20coronavirus%20pandemic.%20We%20want%20to%20learn%20more%20about%20recent%20decisions%20taken%20at%20the%20heart%20of%20government.%20If%20you%E2%80%99re%20a%20whistleblower%20or%20source%20and%20with%20new%20information%2C%20you%20can%20email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Acovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Ecovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20(using%20a%20non-work%20phone)%20use%20Signal%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447584640566%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566.%20(The%20number%20does%20not%20take%20calls.)%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E.%20For%20general%20advice%20on%20confidentially%20contacting%20the%20Guardian%2C%20see%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.%20&link=false\">Investigations</a> </figure>  <p>In another sign of rising British interest in European cooperation, the Guardian has established that the UK attended all five of the EU\u2019s health security committee meetings on the coronavirus pandemic in April, a perfect attendance record, compared with a 70% British presence between 17 January and 30 March.</p> <p>During the April meetings, officials discussed lockdown exit strategies and launching a joint procurement scheme on therapeutics in intensive care.

People couldn\u2019t even wait until the end of lockdown to jump in their cars. On Friday there was so much traffic you could smell the pollution. Now in level 3, it seems that every man and his dog are in their cars, and you can hear the boy racers speeding on the roads, especially at night. I have already witnessed two incidents of road rage on my daily walk. In level 4 you could see whole families out cycling, but in just two days the motorists have intimidated them off the roads. <strong>Anonymous</strong></p> <h2>\u2018I hope we don\u2019t lose birdsong in a rush to return to normal\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df98b7f04e9923080581eb7cc26de792af31d3f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df98b7f04e9923080581eb7cc26de792af31d3f9/0_0_4032_2680/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hanmer Springs on New Zealand\u2019s South island during the coronavirus level 4 lockdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hanmer Springs on New Zealand\u2019s South island during the coronavirus level 4 lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lorna Davies</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the lockdown was eased, it felt as though our town was waking up and stretching after a long sleep. A cafe was buzzing as people returned for their caffeine fix and they had to move the tables outside to remind people that it was takeaway only. The quiet hillside walks we have been taking, almost in complete solitude, were suddenly populated with people laughing and chatting. Vans and cars tripled overnight with tradies ready to carry out maintenance on rentals and holiday homes, and overdue jobs for locals. In the meantime, the native birds sang their hearts out in a backdrop that I hope we don\u2019t lose in a rush to return to normal \u2013 whatever that may look like. <strong>Lorna Davies, Hanmer Springs</strong></p> <h2>\u2018Tamaki Drive was a sight for sore eyes\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7a2c66c65690a9ee66826b46b77273c719488c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7a2c66c65690a9ee66826b46b77273c719488c8/0_605_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katie Riley enjoys the end of New Zealand\u2019s level 4 lockdown on Mission Bay in Auckland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katie Riley enjoys the end of New Zealand\u2019s level 4 lockdown on Mission Bay in Auckland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katie Riley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first thing that was different was the noise. For weeks, I woke up to complete silence, like a Sunday morning, but more intense. I live in a quiet neighbourhood, so the increase in noise is not dramatic, but it is there, a dull background throbbing. I did a few hours of work, cleaned all the living areas, then the call of the beach got to me. I got in my car and drove to Mission Bay. Tamaki Drive, which has to be one of the more scenic city roads anywhere in the world, was a sight for sore eyes; the ocean, the city skyline, the boats, Rangitoto Island and freedom. I drove with the windows down, music blaring, and swore to myself that I would never take such simple pleasures for granted again. <strong>Katie Riley, Auckland</strong></p> <h2>\u2018It was bizarre to see so many people out and about\u2019</h2> <p>Our bubble went to the beach for the first time since before lockdown. It struck all of us how bizarre it was to see so many people out and about. We had become used to it just being the three of us. I\u2019m not sure if a person can develop agoraphobia this quickly, but I definitely feel that gaining back our confidence in public spaces and trusting that those around you are not an immediate threat to your health and wellbeing, are going to be some of the biggest long-term mental challenges we\u2019ll face as we slowly head back to \u201cnormal\u201d life. <strong>Alice Morrison, Dunedin</strong></p> <h2>\u2018It is a relief to have customers again\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"032a79deef61328196d0cc2235021461082508ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/032a79deef61328196d0cc2235021461082508ad/0_252_3024_3780/800.jpg\" alt=\"A contactless drop-off to Marie Rhodes\u2019s framing studio in Tauranga, North Island.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A contactless drop-off to Marie Rhodes\u2019s framing studio in Tauranga, North Island.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marie Rhodes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The relaxation of lockdown to level 3 means I can allow contactless pickup and drop-off of work to my business. I altered my website so people can \u201cbook\u201d the time they will be here, to avoid multiple people being on the premises at once. It is a relief to have customers again, but it is slow going. People seem to prefer to err on the side of caution and stay home still \u2013 I\u2019ve not had a rush of work coming in. <strong>Marie Rhodes, self-employed picture framer, Tauranga</strong></p> <h2><strong>\u2018We are in danger of losing all we worked for\u2019</strong></h2> <p>The messaging here has been clear and the level 4 lockdown saw generally good compliance from the public. Yesterday, however, reminded me how delicate all of this is. I popped to the pharmacy, as I have had to each week during level 4, and it was clear as soon as I pulled to the end of my road that the traffic was more like a normal Saturday afternoon than a Tuesday morning during lockdown. The queue for the McDonald\u2019s drive-thru opposite the pharmacy snaked back towards the motorway, a pattern which seems to have been followed across the country. We are in danger now of losing all that we worked for. <strong>Chris Smith, Auckland</strong></p> <h2><strong>\u2018I felt like the whole lockdown had been a strange dream\u2019</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8b9bab6d463f5742ce542ae5e256a5e416d647e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b9bab6d463f5742ce542ae5e256a5e416d647e7/0_131_1944_2430/800.jpg\" alt=\"Daryl French outside a cafe serving takeaway coffees in central Wellington, North Island.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daryl French outside a cafe serving takeaway coffees in central Wellington, North Island.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daryl French</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I live in the centre of Wellington. It was always a noisy area, but since the lockdown I had become accustomed to the quiet of the city centre. I had forgotten about the lifting of restrictions until I was awoken by the clattering of shutter doors from the appliance shop outside. I decided to go out for a flat white and it was almost overwhelming outside; I forgot to look before crossing the street and almost walked into traffic. The amount of people around made me feel anxious and I felt like the whole lockdown had been a strange dream. It was a beautiful sunny day and everyone seemed to be in great spirits, but I decided to go back to the bubble to finish my coffee. <strong>Daryl French, Wellington</strong></p> <h2><em><strong>\u2018</strong></em><strong>This will be a greater adjustment than the initial lockdown</strong><em><strong>\u2019</strong></em></h2> <p>It is noisy again - the kiwis do love a power tool, usually early in the morning \u2013 and the hope you had that people would be kinder and more relaxed already seems to be dissipating. My local village was bustling again; people queuing for the ubiquitous coffee (the 2m rule semi-ignored), cars becoming impatient with those crossing the road, not so many smiles and \u201chellos\u201d. For me this will be a greater period of adjustment than the initial lockdown; you had \u201cpermission\u201d to be slow, quiet, there were no social expectations, you didn\u2019t have to wash your hair, wear make-up, plan your day, but already I feel the undercurrent of this reappearing and, for me, that will be hard. <strong>Jennifer Clements, Auckland</strong></p>",

Whitmer rejected the idea of making a deal during a public health emergency, but said some outdoor work will be allowed to resume next week. </li> <li><strong>The White House blocked Dr Anthony Fauci from testifying</strong> before a House subcommittee looking into the coronavirus response.

Trump\u2019s \u201cnavigable waters protection rule\u201d, which was published in January, narrows the definition of waterways to exclude ephemeral streams, wetlands, creeks and other headwaters which do not have visible water 365 days a year because they run intermittently or temporarily underground. For example, 90% of streams that connect to the Colorado river, which supplies water to seven western US states and two in northern Mexico, run only after rainfall or snowmelt.</p> <p>The rule, which has attracted widespread criticism from scientists, environmentalists, and the tourism sector, replaces an Obama era regulation that strengthened protection for about 60% of the nation\u2019s interconnected waterways. But it goes much further than just repealing Obama\u2019s 2015 rule, by allowing landowners and developers to dump directly into hundreds of thousands of waterways, and to destroy or fill in wetlands for construction projects.</p> <p>\u201cAccess to clean water is a fundamental right for all Americans. Trump\u2019s dirty water rule ignores the law and science and is a reckless rollback of clean water protections \u2026 which benefits industry polluters and harms countless Americans,\u201d said <strong>Letitia James</strong>, New York\u2019s attorney general, at a virtual press conference today.</p> <p>The lawsuit argues that the new rule will result in more pollution, flooding, and harm to fish and wildlife across the country \u2014 undermining decades of work to protect and enhance water resources - and will result in widespread economic losses.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going into this fight with our three most reliable allies: the facts, science and the law,\u201d said <strong>Xavier Becerra</strong>, California\u2019s attorney general.

This never happened.'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Joe Biden has emphatically denied a sexual assault allegation against him, breaking weeks of silence to address the accusation that has roiled his campaign. </p> <p>\u201c<strong>They aren\u2019t true. This never happened</strong>,\u201d he said in a statement, released moments before his Friday appearance on Morning Joe. </p> <p>Tara Reade accused Biden of sexually assaulting her in the basement of an office building on Capitol Hill in 1993, when she was an aide in his Senate office. His campaign refuted the allegation in a statement, but this is Biden\u2019s first public comment on the accusation.</p> <p>He also calls on the National Archives to release any record of a complaint Reade said she filed. </p> <p>Here is the statement in its entirety: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>April was Sexual Assault Awareness Month. Every year, at this time, we talk about awareness, prevention, and the importance of women feeling they can step forward, say something, and be heard. That belief \u2013 that women should be heard \u2013 was the underpinning of a law I wrote over 25 years ago. To this day, I am most proud of the Violence Against Women Act. So, each April we are reminded not only of how far we have come in dealing with sexual assault in this country \u2013 but how far we still have to go.</p> <p>When I wrote the bill, few wanted to talk about the issue. It was considered a private matter, a personal matter, a family matter. I didn\u2019t see it that way. To me, freedom from fear, harm, and violence for women was a legal right, a civil right, and a human right. And I knew we had to change not only the law, but the culture. <br><br>So, we held hours of hearings and heard from the most incredibly brave women \u2013 and we opened the eyes of the Senate and the nation \u2013 and passed the law.<br><br>In the years that followed, I fought to continually strengthen the law. So, when we took office and President Obama asked me what I wanted, I told him I wanted oversight of the critical appointments in the Office on Violence Against Women at the Department of Justice and I wanted a senior White House Advisor appointing directly to me on the issue. Both of those things happened.<br><br>As Vice President, we started the \u201cIt\u2019s on Us\u201d campaign on college campuses to send the message loud and clear that dating violence is violence \u2013 and against the law. <br><br>We had to get men involved. They had to be part of the solution. That\u2019s why I made a point of telling young men this was their problem too \u2013 they couldn\u2019t turn a blind eye to what was happening around them \u2013 they had a responsibility to speak out. Silence is complicity. <br><br>In the 26 years since the law passed, the culture and perceptions have changed but we\u2019re not done yet.<br><br>It\u2019s on us, and it\u2019s on me as someone who wants to lead this country. I recognize my responsibility to be a voice, an advocate, and a leader for the change in culture that has begun but is nowhere near finished. So I want to address allegations by a former staffer that I engaged in misconduct 27 years ago.<br><br>They aren\u2019t true. This never happened.</p> <p>While the details of these allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault are complicated, two things are not complicated. One is that women deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and when they step forward they should be heard, not silenced. The second is that their stories should be subject to appropriate inquiry and scrutiny. <br><br>Responsible news organizations should examine and evaluate the full and growing record of inconsistencies in her story, which has changed repeatedly in both small and big ways. <br><br>But this much bears emphasizing.<br><br>She has said she raised some of these issues with her supervisor and senior staffers from my office at the time. They \u2013 both men and a woman \u2013 have said, unequivocally, that she never came to them and complained or raised issues. News organizations that have talked with literally dozens of former staffers have not found one \u2013 not one \u2013 who corroborated her allegations in any way. Indeed, many of them spoke to the culture of an office that would not have tolerated harassment in any way \u2013 as indeed I would not have.<br><br>There is a clear, critical part of this story that can be verified. The former staffer has said she filed a complaint back in 1993. But she does not have a record of this alleged complaint. The papers from my Senate years that I donated to the University of Delaware do not contain personnel files. It is the practice of Senators to establish a library of personal papers that document their public record: speeches, policy proposals, positions taken, and the writing of bills. <br><br>There is only one place a complaint of this kind could be \u2013 the National Archives. The National Archives is where the records are kept at what was then called the Office of Fair Employment Practices. I am requesting that the Secretary of the Senate ask the Archives to identify any record of the complaint she alleges she filed and make available to the press any such document. If there was ever any such complaint, the record will be there.<br><br>As a Presidential candidate, I\u2019m accountable to the American people. We have lived long enough with a President who doesn\u2019t think he is accountable to anyone, and takes responsibility for nothing. That\u2019s not me. I believe being accountable means having the difficult conversations, even when they are uncomfortable. People need to hear the truth.<br><br>I have spent my career learning from women the ways in which we as individuals and as policy makers need to step up to make their hard jobs easier, with equal pay, equal opportunity, and workplaces and homes free from violence and harassment. I know how critical women\u2019s health issues and basic women\u2019s rights are. That has been a constant through my career, and as President, that work will continue. And I will continue to learn from women, to listen to women, to support women, and yes, to make sure women\u2019s voices are heard.<br><br>We have a lot of work to do. From confronting online harassment, abuse, and stalking, to ending the rape kit backlog, to addressing the deadly combination of guns and domestic violence. <br><br>We need to protect and empower the most marginalized communities, including immigrant and indigenous women, trans women, and women of color. <br><br>We need to make putting an end to gender-based violence in both the United States and around the world a top priority. <br><br>I started my work over 25 years ago with the passage of the Violence Against Women Act. As president, I\u2019m committed to finishing the job.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read it <a href=\"https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-7a9593bd3012\">here</a>: </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-01T12:03:29.178Z\">at 1.03pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5eac004f8f08f76ffc19f64a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-01T11:59:37.376Z\">12.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Good morning \u2026</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u2026and welcome to another day of coverage of the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 and politics, both concerning the pandemic and tilted towards the election in November \u2013 in the US.</p> <p>The main news of the morning is that <strong>Joe Biden</strong>, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, will appear on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe to answer questions for the first time about <strong>an allegation of sexual assault against him</strong>. </p> <p>In advance of the interview, Biden issued a statement:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I recognize my responsibility to be a voice, an advocate, and a leader for the change in culture that has begun but is nowhere near finished.
