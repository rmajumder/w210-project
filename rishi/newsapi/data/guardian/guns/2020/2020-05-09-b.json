This includes what\u2019s known as \u201c<a href=\"https://foodfirst.org/what-is-parity-and-why-you-should-care/\">parity</a>\u201d \u2013 a fair price for farmers\u2019 crops, guaranteed by the government, to prevent overproduction and market chaos.</p> \n   <p>Subsidies that currently <a href=\"https://ips-dc.org/we-subsidize-the-wrong-kind-of-agriculture/\">propel</a> farming consolidation and mass production of commodities for livestock feed and fuel must be reformed to promote organic, smaller-scale, regionally and local foods. This will help farmers survive and provide communities with resilient and diverse food supplies rather than depending on vast and fragile corporate food supply chains.</p> \n   <p>If there were ever a time to bust up the food and farming monopolies, which are reminiscent of the Beef Trust of the early 1900s, now is it. Centralized corporate power is creating agricultural and economic mono-cropping at a time when we most need a food system that\u2019s diverse, equitable and sustainable.</p> \n   <p>The Covid-19 crisis and worsening climate chaos require far more public-sector direction and coordination of something as central to human survival as food.</p> \n   <p>Amid the current supply-chain breakdown, as news spread of gargantuan food waste, some <a href=\"https://www.wkbw.com/news/state-news/new-york-state-farmers-donate-34-000-pounds-of-milk-beef-and-produce-to-nyc-families-in-need?fbclid=IwAR0L4qkyEIvINGqaGblka5BiOrPTgo-nazaGBJYCfFNmFZ_Zc2NMqz81txU\">farmers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.king5.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/caravan-brings-thousands-of-pound-to-produce-to-western-washington-for-families-in-need/281-1eae725e-6923-4bcc-b7e2-ffb86f4ad56b?fbclid=IwAR2jloI75BLLJRtGwr2uRvLSTU4PlszVTxfkitpzxyheVfiS-euVBTKVfLA\">caravans</a> of volunteers have helped deliver food directly from the farms to people in need \u2013 a truly heroic gift.</p> \n   <p>But this vital act, feeding people in need and averting massive food waste, can\u2019t be left to random acts of kindness.

  "<p>You join me overlooking an empty Edinburgh crossroads, an indoorsman considering my new neck of the woods. Near-empty buses roll down Dundas Street and shush across the junction in the haar (fog). In this brave mute world \u2013 a month of Christmas mornings so far \u2013 I watch lone joggers and mothers with children, and wave at good dogs. I write to my friends. I check in by phone. \u201cYes,\u201d I say, several times a week, \u201cEdinburgh\u2019s very nice. Quiet.\u201d</p> <p>Two years ago, I spent several months travelling for a book, seeking out solitude and remote locations \u2013 strange to think now. I visited wild places on the edge \u2013 frozen Soviet ghost towns, Mars missions in the Utah desert, shrines perched high on Japanese mountains \u2013 as well as spartan structures whose wildness emanated from within, such as Simon Starling\u2019s metamorphic installation <a href=\"https://www.themoderninstitute.com/artists/simon-starling/works/shedboatshed-mobile-architecture-no-2-2005/88/\">Shedboatshed</a>, the writing \u201cWendy houses\u201d of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/feb/08/roald-dahl-100-anniversary-events-wondercrump-the-witches\">Roald Dahl</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/apr/11/moomins-creator-tove-jansson-finland-island-teach-about-small-worlds\">Tove Jansson</a>, and Roger Deakin\u2019s Suffolk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/aug/05/roger-deakin-cabins-walnut-tree-farm-suffolk\">shepherd\u2019s hut</a>.</p> <p>I\u2019m thinking about these places a lot these days; about the way different people either embraced their outposts or, like Jack Kerouac, went to pieces. Kerouac spent his 63 days as a wildfire spotter crazed and lonely, beset by nightmares of yetis and bears \u2026 as well as by actual bears. There are fewer bears in Edinburgh but the cabin fever is still very real.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"37fbc086804eeca2b637cab9916cc7d239d320a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37fbc086804eeca2b637cab9916cc7d239d320a1/0_0_5409_3606/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Mars Desert ResearchStation in a remote cornerof the Utah desert.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Mars Desert Research Station in a remote corner of the Utah desert, US.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jurriaan Brobbel/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here we all are isolating inside, alone together. Parisian writer Sylvain Tesson makes the point in his marvellous book<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/01/consolations-forest-sylvain-tesson-review1\"> Consolations of the Forest</a> when he\u2019s left alone for six months in a cabin in the middle of the Russian Taiga: \u201cIt\u2019s \u201327\u00b0 F. The truck has dissolved into the fog. Silence falls from the sky in little white shavings. To be alone is to hear silence \u2026 I will finally find out if I have an inner life.\u201d</p> <p>The closest I came to such boondocks deprivation in my outpost travels was the days I spent helping renovate a bunkhouse in the middle of Iceland\u2019s interior tundra \u2013 plumb in the middle of nowhere. The hut, called Hv\u00edt\u00e1rnes, was built in 1930 and sits on the shore of a frozen lake facing Iceland\u2019s second-largest glacier. Such cabins are called <em>s\u00e6luh\u00fas</em> in Iceland \u2013 houses of joy \u2013 and it\u2019s easy to see why when one pictures the ancient Norse people sighting such a shelter after a long day\u2019s slog.</p> <p>Originally built as way stations along ancient roads, they are used today by people exploring this country\u2019s uncanny beauty. Rebuilt and reimagined over the centuries, s\u00e6luh\u00fas now range in form from rudimentary rock-and-turf igloos to solid chalets with plumbing and stoves.</p> <p>I travelled to Hv\u00edt\u00e1rnes with two carpenters, Stef\u00e1n and Atli, to fix up the building for future hikers. As we drove towards the glacier\u2019s huge white maw, the s\u00e6luh\u00fas emerged from the grass and marsh: red roof, green gables, white sides banked with turf. A little cabin sitting up, hugging its knees. \u201cSo, you know this place we are going is a very haunted house,\u201d Stef\u00e1n announced. \u201cOh yes?\u201d I replied. Atli met my eye in the rearview mirror. \u201cOh yes!\u201d he said. \u201cOh yes.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"378349f25aff9dcea4054d2f9ebddd02e8a3baf0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/378349f25aff9dcea4054d2f9ebddd02e8a3baf0/0_312_4032_2418/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Landscape shot of Iceland. \u2018Hv\u00edt\u00e1rnes is one of the most haunted buildings in Iceland.

I was furnished with copious tales of spectral encounters \u2013 ghostly women haunting sleepers in the \u201cbad bed\u201d, doors slamming, heavy footsteps in the attic; or walkers approaching a well-lit cabin full of life but opening the front door to find the inside freezing, dark and silent. Imagine walking all day and reaching, at dusk, the only man-made structure on a vast permafrosted plateau to find your bothy beset by poltergeists. It would be\u2026 upsetting.</p> <p>But there was no sign of malevolence for the first week, and work to replace rotten planking and posts went well. In 24-hour daylight we hammered and dug, wrapped up against the wind, tiny figures in a leopard-print prairie. And we all slept well in our cosy cots \u2026 Until the time Stef\u00e1n had \u201ca long night with the ghost\u201d \u2013 an Inception-style series of dreams within dreams, none of them good. \u201cI\u2019m part-troll so I can deal with it,\u201d he told me next morning with a wry smile, but he looked knackered, like a man who\u2019d fought his way out of a supernatural tumble dryer.</p> <p>If ever I awake after bad dreams now, I think of Stef\u00e1n\u2019s matter-of-fact \u201cI\u2019m part troll\u201d mantra, because I think it\u2019s true that being at peace with oneself is important for any traveller who wishes to explore the unknown. So often wild places reveal us to ourselves \u2013 how we are, whether we\u2019re happy in our own skin. If only Kerouac had possessed Stef\u00e1n\u2019s stoicism, faced with the great beyond. So often, to paraphrase early conservationist<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/dec/06/john-muir-conservation-scotland\"> John Muir</a>, going out is really going in. In these locked-down times, many may be longing for company, noise and bustle, but solitude still enthrals me; just as much as wilderness, I think it\u2019s a great teacher.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Dan Richards is author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/04/outpost-journey-wild-ends-earth-dan-richards-review\">Outpost</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/04/outpost-journey-wild-ends-earth-dan-richards-review\">: A Journey to the Wild Ends of the Earth</a> (Canongate, \u00a39.99)</em></p>",

But a week after his return to Halls Gap in regional Victoria, Ryan was in bed, shaking himself to sleep. His suspicions were confirmed in a phone call from the state\u2019s Department of Health, which informed him his swab had returned positive.</p> <p>Breaking the news to his parents, a notable pause from his mother made him realise it would be a stress they\u2019d share. \u201cIt was the first time I ever thought of my mortality,\u201d he says. \u201cI definitely put a brave face on \u2013 and I know it\u2019s not the right thing to do.\u201d</p> <p>At his worst mentally and physically, Ryan prepared end-of-life arrangements and organised a will to avoid burdening his parents. \u201cI called a group of friends and asked if they\u2019d carry my coffin,\u201d he says. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018This thing people are so frightened of, this thing has the ability to kill me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Looking for relief, Ryan searched online for people recounting their experience of milder cases but what he found at the time was grim. \u201cIt would have felt amazing to turn on the TV and hear from someone I could associate with,\u201d he says. \u201cI understand it\u2019s horrific but it\u2019s important to give hope.\u201d</p> <p>For Ryan, the toughest time came at night. When supportive friends and family slept, he was plagued by questions that began with \u201cwhat if\u201d. He relentlessly searched for signs of improvement and was overwhelmed by what he saw online.

She stared back blankly.</p> <p>At the grocery store the other shoppers were, he says, \u201cin a different world to me \u2013 they were nervous, I was on a high\u201d. He felt \u201cuntouchable\u201d.</p> <p>For Sweetser, who lives in a share house with his 18-year-old son and a roommate, isolating in his bedroom was easy enough. He plugged a throwaway kettle into his en suite, had an assortment of disinfectants on hand and kept himself entertained with streaming services. He worked sporadically as an engineer. At the height of his symptoms, he stayed in bed. After some concern about how he and his son would be fed, the problem was solved by Sikh Volunteers Australia who dropped off hot meals. Logistically, most things were there: except empathy.</p> <p>\u201cThere was no compassion for me or the fact I might die, just themselves,\u201d he says of his son and roommate, who entertained conspiracy theories about the virus.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You're made to feel like you've done something wrong</p> <footer> <cite>David*</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Even after an honest conversation about their hostility, little changed, Sweetser recounts. \u201cIt felt biblical, I felt like a leper,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was the hardest part \u2013 being ostracised in your own home.\u201d</p> <p>Sweetser was cautious and managed to recover without infecting either housemate. But when his son left the air conditioning running for too long \u2013 a pet peeve of Sweetser \u2013 he jokingly threatened to touch the remote without a glove.</p> <p>As a regular blood donor in the past, Sweetser has been hoping researchers will ask him to be a part of a trial or make a blood donation.</p> <p>Instead, the question he does get often is if he will write a science fiction book on a deadly virus, having already published a few e-books in the genre. His answer is firm no: \u201cIt\u2019s boring. I like an enemy you can see \u2026 I prefer something like robots.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Karen Clements, 55: \u2018My immunity is now my superpower\u2019</strong></h2> <p>On the first leg of her trip home from a holiday in the US, Karen Clements had just flown out of New York when the pilot announced that the city\u2019s airspace had gone into a rare shutdown.</p> <p>By the time she boarded her third flight, Clements was riddled with anxiety. Airports were empty and passengers were scarce. Sharing a plane with cruise patrons, she worried about contracting the virus \u2013 unaware she already had it herself.</p> <p>\u201cThe stress was worse than my symptoms,\u201d says Clements, who had discounted her migraines and nausea as side-effects from travelling. \u201cI got home, my legs buckled, and I had a massive anxiety attack.\u201d</p> <p>After calling for an ambulance, paramedics arrived in protective suits and, though she no longer showed signs of the virus, a cautionary swab returned positive.</p> <p>With the mild symptoms behind her, Clements grappled with disbelief.

Recognising what she had done, Valvo walked back and apologised, assuring him it was OK because she was likely to be immune.</p> <p>After catching the virus from her daughter, a flight attendant, Valvo isolated at home with her husband: \u201cHe was asymptomatic but he could have had the virus.

The pair were among the first 80 cases in Australia; Anna was the first wedding guest to test positive.

Almost immediately, she said, Biden made her uncomfortable with behavior she said included putting his hand on her neck in a meeting.</p> <p>Reade said she reported Biden\u2019s conduct to superiors and was told to dress more conservatively. All such former Biden staffers have emphatically denied ever being informed of such a complaint.</p> <p>Not long after this conversation, Reade told Kelly, she was asked to deliver a bag to Biden in the Russell Senate office building.

  "<p>Little Richard\u2019s Rip It Up entered the UK top 30, right at the bottom, in December 1956. It looked up at a chart that included Bill Haley and Elvis Presley, but was mostly filled with light opera gloop such as Malcolm Vaughan\u2019s St Therese of the Roses, three different versions of the cod-calypso of Cindy, Oh Cindy, and toddler-friendly novelties including Dickie Valentine\u2019s Christmas Island and Mitchell Torok\u2019s When Mexico Gave Up the Rhumba, while the spirit of the blitz lived on with Vera Lynn\u2019s A House With Love in It. Play any of these records either side of Rip It Up and the effects are guaranteed goosebumps, an involuntary laugh and real surprise. With the sheer volume of Richard\u2019s raw-throated scream \u2013 ebullient, gleeful, quite filthy \u2013 the shock of the new can still be felt. Rip It Up \u2013 that title alone!</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Think of Bowie. Think of Prince. Little Richard was doing the same thing \u2013 with greater extravagance \u2013 decades earlier</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>By the following March, he was a sensation in Britain, with three singles \u2013 Long Tall Sally, She\u2019s Got It, The Girl Can\u2019t Help It \u2013 in the top 20. The early rock\u2019n\u2019roll hits were all about teenage concerns: Elvis\u2019s were about sex, Bill Haley\u2019s were about dancing and Gene Vincent\u2019s were about menace, and all of them dropped in fashion references. But Little Richard\u2019s singles were unrelatable \u2013 they got by entirely on their freakish energy. Theoretically, the lyrics were about gals named Sue and Daisy, but something else was going on. Long Tall Sally was an almost monotone roar from the off, Richard\u2019s voice a Martian wail, and references to bald-headed Sally, Uncle John, and sneaking in and out of alleys weren\u2019t obvious Friday night knee-trembler material. Little Richard\u2019s music was omnisexual and alien. It broke down barriers that Britain\u2019s teenagers didn\u2019t even know existed.</p> \n<p>Of course, Richard Penniman\u2019s sonic impact was only part of his outrageous long-term cultural impact. An erotic wild man, a drag queen, with a pencil moustache and pancake makeup, he had no predecessors; no one was about to confuse him with Dickie Valentine. Think how far beyond description Prince and Bowie seemed at their point of breakthrough, then think how Richard Penniman was doing much the same \u2013 and with greater extravagance \u2013 two to three decades earlier.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqL_pinZVp8\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TqL_pinZVp8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>James Brown adored Little Richard, mimicked his scream and his rhythmic whoops, although Richard would be the first to defer to Brown\u2019s dancing prowess. The sound and style of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/21/otis-redding-interview-rocks-back-pages-mr-cool-and-the-clique-from-memphis\">Otis Redding</a> \u2013 the second most famous son of Macon, Georgia \u2013 owed Richard everything. Later, there would be Sly Stone, Bootsy Collins, Janelle Mon\u00e1e. Beyond that, Slade\u2019s breakthrough hit, Get Down and Get With It, was a cover of Richard\u2019s UK-recorded 1967 single Get Down With It, and Noddy Holder\u2019s voice was a direct descendant. Led Zeppelin took the thundering drum intro to Rock and Roll from Richard\u2019s Keep A-Knockin\u2019. Elton John was a shy member of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/17/elton-john-interview\">Bluesology</a> when they supported Richard at London\u2019s Saville theatre in 1967 and saw the excitement generated by a peacock-plumaged star standing on top of a piano. When the Beatles supported Richard at the Tower Ballroom in the Merseyside resort of New Brighton in October 1962, he reportedly gave Paul McCartney tips on how to scream in tune; his advice would be put to good use on I\u2019m Down, Hey Jude, Maybe I\u2019m Amazed and other raucous Macca moments. </p> \n<p>The most remarkable thing about his influence is that Richard\u2019s time in the sun was so brief. After two years of raucous singles on the Specialty label, he released his first album, Here\u2019s Little Richard, in May 1957. That October, he announced his retirement from show business. Pop lost him to the church, and his records for the next five years were gospel \u2013 and dreary gospel at that. All momentum was lost, and he spent the rest of his career playing catch-up. </p> \n<p>You almost never hear them, but Little Richard did make good records \u2013 and some great records \u2013 after the 1950s. We can thank the impresario Don Arden for bringing him back into the fold.</p> \n<p>When Arden arranged for Richard to tour Britain in 1962, he was reportedly unaware that he was booking a gospel show. Richard appeared in an ecclesiastical cloak, accompanied by Billy Preston on church organ. Fortunately for Arden, the support act, Sam Cooke, drove the audience wild; Richard\u2019s competitive spirit overcame his godliness, and compelled him to play his hits so as not to be outshone. The gospel set lasted for all of one show. By 1964, Richard was back in the UK top 20 with Bama Lama Bama Loo, an obvious nod to his 50s hits, but strong enough to be a springboard for his comeback. He would remain a huge draw in concert, but there would be no more British hits, and Richard\u2019s subsequent recording career is hard to follow.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>He was the King of Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll. Every so often, he\u2019d feel the crown slip and make a little more noise</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>With judicious editing, you can avoid the re-recordings and budget compilations and realise that his discography didn\u2019t have to be so random and messy. As early as 1962, immediately after the Don Arden shows, he cut six secular sides under the group pseudonym the World Famous Upsetters so he wouldn\u2019t compromise his position in the church. One single emerged: a tough update of Fats Domino\u2019s I\u2019m in Love Again, backed by an intense and beautiful Every Night About This Time, which matched his very best 50s sides but was barely heard.</p> \n<p>The mid-60s soul era suited Richard\u2019s powerful voice to a T. One of his finest recordings was 1966\u2019s Dance A Go-Go (aka Dancing All Around the World). It matched the supercharged clanking backbeat of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/22/how-we-made-motown-records-berry-gordy-smokey-robinson-stevie-wonder-interview\">Smokey Robinson</a> and the Miracles\u2019 Going to a Go-Go to one of Richard\u2019s most ebullient vocals \u2013 he sounds like the happiest man alive. The song was only pressed as the B-side on promo copies of his deep soul ballad hit, Don Covay\u2019s I Don\u2019t Know What You\u2019ve Got (But It\u2019s Got Me). Almost no one heard it until the song turned up on compilations in the 70s. What a terrible waste.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Little Richard Spotify playlist\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:guardianmusic:playlist:4NZiVQrtIcGKVyby2z03g5\" width=\"300\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The fault for these missteps may well lie with Richard himself. Take the song I Don\u2019t Want To Discuss It \u2013 it has tricksy funk drumming allied with a flat-out northern beat, with Richard relatively restrained, but it works perfectly. Unfortunately, he hated it, and said he wanted to throw every brass instrument in the world \u2013 presumably with the exception of his signature honking sax \u2013 off a cliff. Give the people what they want: another cover album of 50s hits. Why need he bother with anything else? He was the King of Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll. Every so often, he\u2019d feel the crown slip and make a little more noise.</p> \n<p>There were two other lads on the comeback trail in the late 60s making the same claim. The trio may have been rival contenders for the title, but the mutual respect between Elvis Presley, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/08/jerry-lee-lewis-interview-heaven-hell\">Jerry Lee Lewis</a> and Little Richard was there on record \u2013 Elvis covered Richard (Rip It Up), Jerry Lee covered Richard (Jenny Jenny), and Richard covered Jerry Lee (Whole Lotta Shakin\u2019 Goin\u2019 On). The winner of this three-way tie was probably the singer who had never made the claim but simply let the public, and his record label, put the epithet out: Elvis became the King, no rock\u2019n\u2019roll qualifier needed.</p> \n<p>Unlike Lewis and Richard, Elvis\u2019s career sustained through the 60s. Even when he was cutting stinky soundtrack records, there was some sense of progress from his 50s recordings and his humility would pay dividends on the 1968 Singer Presents Elvis television comeback special, which gave his career a huge boost. Richard\u2019s career, meanwhile, felt like a neverending succession of comebacks.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>At a festival in 1969, John Lennon and Yoko Ono insisted on headlining and had the gall to play Little Richard's songs</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Why was this? One reason was that he had alienated a large part of his potential audience by refusing to play any kind of black awareness events. In any case, his existing audience was primarily white. Richard was never seen as a totem of the black community in the way that Joe Tex or James Brown were. Black radio stations tended to avoid him. Another reason was that he never stuck with a record label long enough for them to build a head of steam: in the 60s alone he recorded for End, Mercury, Atlantic, Specialty (a second stint with the label that broke him), Vee-Jay, Modern, Okeh, Brunswick and Reprise, where he settled for a record-breaking four years.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OfhmVmhL7s\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2OfhmVmhL7s?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>It wasn\u2019t as if there weren\u2019t opportunities for Richard to make it back to the top. At a festival in Toronto in 1969, John Lennon and Yoko Ono insisted on headlining, coming on after Little Richard, with the gall to include some of his songs in their set. Bumps Blackwell, who had produced those breakthrough singles for Richard in 1955, thought they were \u201crude\u201d. A riled Richard played an electrifying set. This followed fast on the heels of another festival in Atlantic City, at which he had upstaged Janis Joplin. Suddenly, with a return to rock roots pervading the charts \u2013 Creedence Clearwater Revival at one end of the spectrum, Sha Na Na at the other \u2013 Richard was in demand again.</p> \n<p>He still looked the part, too. People came expecting a wheezing man, someone as armchair-bound as Fats Domino, but he was as energetic and thrilling as he had been a dozen years earlier. Mo Ostin at Reprise signed him on the back of the Toronto show, and he quickly had an album (The Rill Thing) and a catchy new single (Freedom Blues) in the US charts.</p> \n<p>Richard went on to cut four albums for Reprise in the early 70s, a period of brief stability. For once, however \u2013 and this is surprising, given that they were at heart a supportive and understanding label \u2013 he had genuine cause to feel a grievance with the record company. Reprise gave him material by writers who had clearly been inspired by him (I Saw Her Standing There, Brown Sugar, Born on the Bayou), but it felt like an odd form of cap-doffing that often made for an unsatisfying end product. (Similarly, Reprise got Fats Domino to record Lady Madonna in 1968, a tribute to a tribute). Freedom Blues turned out to be another false dawn.</p> \n<p>Richard\u2019s biggest problems in the 1970s weren\u2019t record companies, but his drink and drug habits, which he later estimated cost him $1,000 a day. Larry Williams had begun in 1957 as a substitute Little Richard on Specialty with hits like Short Fat Fannie and Bony Moronie, before he turned provider \u2013 he wrote and produced Richard\u2019s terrific 1967 single I Need Love, with Commandments of Love on the flipside. By the 70s he was one of Richard\u2019s drug dealers, and allegedly called in a debt with a gun pointed at his mentor\u2019s head. While later laughing and claiming Williams loved him dearly, Richard was also certain Williams would have shot him if he hadn\u2019t stumped up the money on the spot. That was one of several dreadful episodes to befall the singer in 1977 \u2013 the murders of two close friends, the accidental shooting death of his nephew and his brother\u2019s fatal heart attack \u2013 that sent him back into the arms of the church. Most likely, he\u2019d have died the same year had he not changed his ways.</p> \n<p>To all intents and purposes, this was the end of Little Richard\u2019s career. Everything from this point on was built on the existing Richard persona, and that all too brief run of 50s hits. He would make regular appearances on stage and on chatshows, and would occasionally guest on the unlikeliest record. In 1990, Living Colour\u2019s Elvis Is Dead saw him briefly and thrillingly try his hand at rap: \u201cTo all you pimps making money on his name \u2026 don\u2019t you feel ashamed? Be my guest and let him rest!\u201d. He had nothing left to prove, after all. He had done more to break down racial and sexual barriers than almost any artist in the 20th century, and his greatest recordings are imperishable. We were lucky to have him, and he knew it.

  "<p>It seems that Adele\u2019s weight is fast becoming a feminist issue, although not in the way people usually mean. Last year, images of the singer\u2019s extreme weight loss rocked the world. When she released a photo to mark her 32nd birthday last week, the internet exploded all over again. Some people thought her new look was great; others considered it a (whisper it) betrayal. Some accused her of having a gastric band; others bitched that she would soon pile it all back on again. \u201cShe looks good.\u201d \u201cShe looks bad.\u201d \u201cShe looks weird.\u201d And on it goes.</p> <p>Adele isn\u2019t new to this: her weight was also discussed (admiringly, critically, endlessly) <em>before</em> she lost it. In the modern musical landscape, where female artists specifically are viciously pressured to be perma-slim, the message seemed to be that she was one of those rare talents who were \u201callowed\u201d to be bigger. At other times, the focus on her weight verged on patronising and reductive, as though her BMI-based \u201crelatability\u201d was the main draw and her talent a poor second.</p> <p>Is this why she decided to lose weight (she felt trapped in an outdated, stifling persona), or was it for health, love, personal reinvention? \u201cCome on, Adele,\u201d the world seems to be saying. \u201cNever mind your stellar achievements. Stand in a pair of outsized leggings stretching them out to demonstrate how wonderfully skinny you got. Tell us your weight loss story.\u201d</p> <p>For some, weight truly is the torture that never ends. On Planet Woman, even today, weight loss is still mainly cast as the life-giving sun, while weight gain is the foreboding death star that will <em>kill your dreams</em>. For some, it gets properly serious. The plus-size people who are made to feel grotesque on a daily basis. The anorexics whose deadly mental health condition is undermined and underfunded. The questions \u2013 the rage \u2013 around weight, diets and body image never stop. Why is a thin woman preferable to a fat one? Why is smaller better than bigger? Then you get Adele, a celebrity who decided to lose a shedload of weight, and there\u2019s another pressing feminist question: whose business is it really?</p> <p>It\u2019s depressing that one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/mar/27/adele-21-letterman-no1-interview\">most celebrated singers of her generation</a> has been reduced so easily and vehemently to a fat/thin binary. It\u2019s not that there\u2019s been a reaction to Adele\u2019s weight loss; rather, that she has come to embody every possible over-reaction. There\u2019s nothing wrong with a bit of a gossip but, casting around, neutrality to her new body is tellingly scarce. Instead, it\u2019s Adele is a \u201cthinspiration\u201d. No, Adele is too thin! She\u2019s let down other women! She\u2019s cheated with surgery! She\u2019ll be fat again soon! Some of these people won\u2019t even realise why her size matters so much to them, just that it really does. Somehow, just by deciding to lose weight, Adele has been forced to take on the burden of all the fatphobia in the world.</p> <h2>Scientists have never been so sexy</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"986ee68c1ddf633b78e905d51e6a978318b19209\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/986ee68c1ddf633b78e905d51e6a978318b19209/1852_518_3571_2143/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neil Ferguson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neil Ferguson: \u2018exceptionalism as its raciest\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Angus/Imperial College London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Oh no, the mother-in-law of the disgraced government scientific adviser, Neil Ferguson, clearly didn\u2019t get the media memo.

Otherwise, although there\u2019s much to love about your spirited and civilised response, it\u2019s complicated regarding Ferguson.</p> <p>Obviously Ferguson, who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-adviser-prof-neil-ferguson-resigns-after-breaking-lockdown-rules\">resigned</a>, shouldn\u2019t have flouted his own lockdown advice. Sure, some of the attacks seem politically motivated, not to mention salacious. However, Ferguson has a nerve: telling everyone to stay home to save lives, and then having his girlfriend over to save his own sanity. This was exceptionalism as its raciest.</p> <p>Still, no wonder some scientists might prefer to remain anonymous. It\u2019s one thing signing up to steer the nation through a pandemic, quite another ending up as tabloid fodder.

If this carries on, seats on scientific committees will have to start featuring leather straps and leg irons to keep the scientists there.</p> <p>It\u2019s not entirely unamusing to ponder the concept of data love gods (\u201cIs that your statistical model, or are you just pleased to see me?\u201d).

Had Everton managed to find a second goal just after the break, when Liverpool collectively lost their heads - they looked <em>gone -</em> they\u2019d have surely closed this game out. They\u2019d been much the better side for most of the first hour. And that\u2019s without bringing up the penalty shout. But Liverpool dug in, and when they finally found their rhythm, all bets were off. Two of their goals were astonishing pitch-length sweeps. Jan Molby was imperious, Ian Rush ice-cool and deadly. They imposed themselves on the final half hour to such an extent that 3-1 doesn\u2019t flatter them in the slightest. You have to feel sorry for Everton, who came so close to the double themselves. But this Liverpool side are worthy winners of both league and cup, and can now be found in the record books alongside the famous teams of Preston North End, Aston Villa, Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal.

There shouldn\u2019t be much; this wonderfully strange, effervescent game has flowed from the get-go like a bubbling mountain stream.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5eb6cf9d8f08464cd4297315\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-09T15:44:06.026Z\">4.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>89 min:</strong> All very scrappy now, and Liverpool care not a jot. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5eb6cf838f08c0a2409babdb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-09T15:43:17.000Z\">4.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>88 min: </strong>Dalglish scampers down the right, and has his boot whipped off by Bracewell.

Van den Hauwe comes racing in, but Molby turns and knocks the ball past him, into the wide open space the right-back had vacated. What vision! Whelan romps into acres down the inside left, past the naughty blue balloon, and checks infield. Dalglish makes a run across him and to the left, and wants the ball; he\u2019d be free in the box if Whelan plays the reverse pass. But Rush is sailing in from the right, and Whelan curls a perfect diagonal looper over Ratcliffe, the ball dropping gently at the feet of the striker. Rush takes a touch to sort his feet and batters an unstoppable shot across Mimms and into the bottom left, sending a camera flying.

The big Dane draws three Everton shirts, then flicks the ball through them with outrageous ease, releasing Rush with a perfectly weighted dink down the channel. Rush takes one touch to round Mimms on the left, then another to smoothly roll home. Johnston, the cheeky get, follows the ball in and tries to toe-poke it over the line, but he doesn\u2019t get there in time, it\u2019s Rush\u2019s goal.

Grobbelaar is beyond livid and squares up to Beglin, chest out. There\u2019s a full and frank exchange of views before the keeper shoves Beglin in the shoulder and wags a vicious finger at him.

Bracewell is on him in a flash, nipping the ball away from behind and allowing Sheedy to take up possession. He bursts into the box to the right of the D. He\u2019s one on one with Grobbelaar, though Hansen is doing his best to shepherd him further right. Sheedy goes for the top left, but his shot across the keeper is always curling away from goal. Inches wide of the left-hand post. A foot the other way and Grobbelaar wasn\u2019t getting to that.

Grobbelaar does well to get down and save, but the ball squirts to the right, and Lineker is perfectly placed to dink the rebound home with Hansen flat-footed and the keeper prone! That, it is safe to say, had been coming.

That looked extremely close, with Van den Hauwe almost certainly playing Dalglish on from a deep position on the opposite flank. Whether Dalglish would have finished the job had play been waved on is another argument; Ratcliffe got back and buzzed around him after the whistle, and Dalglish\u2019s eventual shot was deflected out for what would have been a corner.

That was a delightful sequence by Everton, and a little more juice on the final pass would have sent Lineker clear. The resulting corner is an opportunity for Grobbelaar to showcase his juggling skills, plucking the ball from atop Sharp\u2019s neep and Harlem Globetrotting for a couple of seconds.

However Ratcliffe, on his left shoulder, is a discombobulating presence, and a perfectly timed challenge nicks the ball away. Van den Hauwe does the rest with a line-clearing blooter.

He strokes a first-time pass wide right for Nicol, who slips a ball down the flank for Johnston. For a second, it looks as though he\u2019s got a yard on Ratcliffe; if so, he\u2019ll make it into the box. But the Everton captain recovers, goes shoulder to shoulder, and closes the door. Had Johnston got past, he had Dalglish and Rush in the middle, with barely 15 seconds on the clock. Jackie Milburn\u2019s quickest-goal record of 45 seconds, set in 1955 when Newcastle United did for Manchester City, stands for another year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8210f7f78fc7b14c01aa768f5816ea79fe1608c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8210f7f78fc7b14c01aa768f5816ea79fe1608c/0_78_2160_1370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Everton\u2019s Kevin Ratcliffe (right) tussles with Craig Johntson of Liverpool.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"634\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Everton\u2019s Kevin Ratcliffe (right) tussles with Craig Johntson of Liverpool.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-09T15:32:38.121Z\">at 4.32pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5eb6b5268f08c0a2409bab16\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-09T13:55:36.829Z\">2.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It\u2019s sunny but windy at Wembley.</strong> The 1986 FA Cup final will be underway imminently.

Sources in Iraq, Syria and Yemen in particular suggest that Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, and the Quds Force that projects its core interests, are struggling to maintain momentum.</p> <p>Interviews with Iraqi and Lebanese officials show his replacement, Esmail Ghaani, struggling to assert his authority, even after doing the rounds of Iraq\u2019s power base and the proxy networks that Suleimani had assembled over the 17 years of chaos that followed the US invasion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5c3d2a9c2e0b3926e47ea6477d6d96dccee60c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5c3d2a9c2e0b3926e47ea6477d6d96dccee60c2/0_112_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Esmail Ghaani at the funeral of Qassem Soleimani in Tehran in January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Esmail Ghaani at the funeral of Qassem Suleimani in Tehran in January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t speak the language, doesn\u2019t have the history in the region, and \u2013 to be fair to him \u2013 has been given a mandate that he can\u2019t deliver on,\u201d said an Iraqi official with ties to the country\u2019s national security apparatus. \u201cHe was in Afghanistan for 12 years and can\u2019t be expected to know the ways of the Iraqi tribes, or how things have been done here since the Saddam years.\u201d</p> <p>An image of Ghaani getting his beard trimmed during the Iran-Iraq war appeared on Iranian social media earlier this month, in an apparent attempt to make the new Quds Force leader more recognisable. On the same day, perhaps coincidentally, an Iranian publisher announced that Suleimani\u2019s memoirs from the Iran-Iraq war, titled <em>Our Blessed Comrade</em>, would soon be released. Even as Ghaani\u2019s backers tried to personalise him, his slain predecessor was eclipsing him from the grave.</p> <p>In Iran, Suleimani\u2019s role \u2013 as intelligence chief, special forces commander and presidential envoy to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei \u2013 has effectively been broken down. No one is likely to win such broad authority again. Without the weight of Suleimani, the Iranian-backed militia networks established over the past 17 years are proving difficult to manage.</p> <p>As Kadhimi edged closer to the top job, supported also by the US and Saudi Arabia, both of whom saw him as a leader outside of Iran\u2019s grip on Iraq, he ran foul of one of Iraq\u2019s most powerful militias, Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah, which has accused him of facilitating the US operation that killed Suleimani, and their leader, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, on a Baghdad road in the early hours of 3 January.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ff1af75455fcdfeeab92447cf3bd84dc231c0a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ff1af75455fcdfeeab92447cf3bd84dc231c0a1/0_73_4320_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A boy in Tehran holds a portrait of Qassem Soleimani.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A boy in Tehran holds a portrait of Qassem Suleimani.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vahid Salemi/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a statement issued in early this month, the group said: \u201cDuring the sensitive times we are going through, the brothers in politics who brought Mustafa al-Kadhimi to be prime minister-designate should know before it\u2019s too late that the man is not up to the responsibility that has been given to him and is still accused of a crime of which he hasn\u2019t been acquitted.\u201d</p> <p>Weeks earlier, Kadhimi had sought a meeting with Keta\u2019ib Hezbollah\u2019s leadership under the auspices of Iraq\u2019s president, where he tried to assure them that he had played no role in the deaths, but left open the possibility that an official in the Iraqi National Intelligence Service might have had contact with US spies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902yKzym1KdWG7u/\" data-alt=\"Map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902yKzym1KdWG7u/\">Map</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe informal agreement was that they would not stop him from getting the job, but would continue to talk out against him,\u201d said an official familiar with the conversation.</p> <p>\u201cKadhimi is facing so much pressure,\u201d said an official connected to the Iraqi presidency. \u201cThere are rows between the Shia parties, who don\u2019t see eye-to-eye on a lot. As for the Iranians, of course the loss of Muhandis and Qassem was a major blow; they\u2019re rearranging their structures now. But have they lost control? Not at all, the proof is their meddling in the formation.\u201d</p> <p>With Kadhimi now Iraq\u2019s premier decision-maker, US and Saudi officials are privately hailing a new era of Iraqi sovereignty. Washington pushed its allies in the country\u2019s Kurdish north and Sunni centre to endorse him. \u201cThey think they\u2019ve got their man,\u201d a regional official said. \u201cThey\u2019re celebrating.

  "<p>It\u2019s a good principle that, except in exceptional circumstances, architecture critics see the buildings that they review. You wouldn\u2019t want a food critic to recommend a restaurant based on photographs of loaded plates, nor a theatre critic to base their judgments on films of performances. You\u2019re meant to sniff, feel and sense the things you describe, to experience them in the round.</p> <p>There\u2019s a downside to this good principle, which is that buildings don\u2019t come to you, and that many fine works are done all over the world which it would be absurdly expensive and eco-reckless to visit. Circumstances are, what\u2019s more, what can only be described as exceptional. Given that almost everywhere is now almost equally inaccessible, whether another county or another continent, I\u2019ve decided to make an opportunity out of a problem, and to offer a world tour of the very best new architecture, as seen through the portal of a laptop.</p> <p>It helps that there are several websites \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/\">Dezeen</a>, <a href=\"https://www.archdaily.com/\">ArchDaily</a>, <a href=\"https://www.designboom.com/\">Designboom</a>, <a href=\"https://archinect.com/\">Archinect</a>, or the pickier <a href=\"https://www.domusweb.it/en.html\">Domusweb</a>, <a href=\"https://archpaper.com/\">Archpaper</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.architectural-review.com/special-subscription-offers?gclid=Cj0KCQjw-r71BRDuARIsAB7i_QMIkLpJHzW8Ir4FQ0nBVuFaUSRyjz2CUj8wjbXnlXOq644UP-M2f8AaAhEpEALw_wcB\">Architectural Review</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wallpaper.com/\">Wallpaper*</a> \u2013 that daily display new architectural gems sent to them by hopeful practices. I therefore propose a top 10 of the hundreds that have been published on these sites in the time of Covid-19. The start of this period is tricky to define, but let\u2019s say it was early March, which was when it dawned that this is a truly worldwide crisis.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The best of these projects are theatres for life, wherever it might take place</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a varied harvest. There are attention-seekers and duds among those hundreds of projects. There are a few ambulance-chasers \u2013 those who seek to promote themselves by proposing their very own architectural responses to emergencies, responses for which nobody asked. But there is also the never-ending desire of architects to discover in every building project the chance to make the world a little more interesting and a little more enjoyable. The best of these projects are theatres for life, whether that life is seeing art, living in your home, going to school or meeting friends, and wherever it might take place: in an ancient city, in a refugee camp, in deep countryside. They aim to make that life richer, fuller and more surprising.</p> <p>A few things stand out. One is the quality of work in places not traditionally seen as architectural powerhouses, such as Vietnam, Lebanon, Bangladesh and Paraguay. There is a related lack of really big names, the Dutch <a href=\"https://www.mvrdv.nl/\">MVRDV</a> being the best known to make the list. There\u2019s no single dominating style, although it is somewhat amazing how prevalent is a version of modernism that first matured some time in the middle of the last century \u2013 one that favours undecorated but textured surfaces like timber and rough concrete, sculpted into plain but sometimes complex forms.</p> <p>There\u2019s a good side to the persistence of this style \u2013 if it ain\u2019t broke why fix it? \u2013 but it leaves you wondering why this century doesn\u2019t have more to add. You are also grateful for those works that offer something else entirely: the self-indulgent but entertaining <a href=\"https://www.vensvanbelle.be/#alex\">guesthouse Alex</a>, for example, or the bamboo-built safe space. In some of the choices there\u2019s a certain attraction to the creative reuse of wrecked old buildings. This ruinlust might betray a personal preference, but it also reveals some architects\u2019 move away from the making of brand new magic objects towards the mining of the already-there.</p> <p>There are hazards in this operation. It\u2019s hard to tell at a distance if a building presents an ugly backside to its neighbours, or if there are catastrophic details out of sight of the camera. Did the budgets spiral out of control? Did any of these marvels reduce their clients or builders to sobbing wrecks? Are those humanitarian projects actually diverting resources from more essential but less photogenic purposes? I\u2019ll guess not, but it\u2019s difficult to know for sure.</p> <p>Mostly, it\u2019s heartening. There\u2019s energy and invention out there, plus the ability to respond to unusual and challenging situations. Which are qualities we will all need, whenever we are allowed out in public again.</p> <h2>Rowan Moore\u2019s top 10 new architecture projects (in no particular order)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47d80ee9a25abffc6de0d212e1d636b7b9fd77ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47d80ee9a25abffc6de0d212e1d636b7b9fd77ad/0_0_4992_4184/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Museum of Contemporary Art Helga de Alvear, C\u00e1ceres, Spain, by Emilio Tu\u00f1\u00f3n.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"838\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Stillness meets movement\u2019: Emilio Tu\u00f1\u00f3n\u2019s Museum of Contemporary Art Helga de Alvear in C\u00e1ceres, Spain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alberto Amores + Pancho Matienzo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.archdaily.com/936426/museum-of-contemporary-art-helga-de-alvear-emilio-tunon-arquitectos\">Museum of Contemporary Art Helga de Alvear, C\u00e1ceres, Spain, by Emilio Tu\u00f1\u00f3n</a><br></strong>On the one hand there\u2019s the stately rhythm of white pillars, which speak of temple-like repose. On the other there\u2019s an intricate series of steps and terraces, both inside and out, that work their way up, around and through the building, such that it grows out of the hilly city around it. Stillness meets movement, in other words. Closer examination reveals other nuances: the concrete verticals narrow as they get higher, and what at first sight seem rectangular rooms are skewed into parallelograms. A dignified and subtle work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"95cd0e518fee109ae64eaea9a083f71b4e5b3b2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95cd0e518fee109ae64eaea9a083f71b4e5b3b2f/0_0_3543_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tainan Spring, Tainan, Taiwan, by MVRDV.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shopping mall turned urban lagoon\u2026 Tainan Spring, Taiwan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Daria Scagliola</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.mvrdv.nl/projects/272/tainan-axis\">Tainan Spring, Taiwan, by MVRDV</a><br></strong>Most towns and cities have one: a senescent shopping centre once hailed as an economic engine, now overstaying its welcome like a kitchen appliance that the binmen won\u2019t take away. Tainan Spring offers a bold and direct response. Here the ruins of the China-Town mall, built over an old harbour in 1983, have been made into a public \u201clagoon\u201d, whose levels change with dry and rainy seasons, and with cooling vapour mists when it\u2019s hot. It\u2019s promised that the vegetation will become lush in three years, in evocation of the jungle that was there before the city came.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1af6fa8bc95edb811185ddfb0e07793ef6933b5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1af6fa8bc95edb811185ddfb0e07793ef6933b5d/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Beyond Survival Safe Space, Teknaf, Bangladesh,  Rizvi Hassan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rizvi Hassan\u2019s Beyond Survival Safe Space in Bangladesh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rizvi Hassan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.designboom.com/architecture/rizvi-hassan-beyond-survival-safe-space-women-girls-rohingya-refugee-camp-bangladesh-03-22-2020/\">Beyond Survival Safe Space, Teknaf, Bangladesh, by Rizvi Hassan</a><br></strong>This is a sheltered place in a camp for 600,000 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, where young women and girls can gather. It is built and decorated by residents of the camp, using locally sourced bamboo. As it was built in a hurry its materials will be short-lived, to be replaced by more durable alternatives later. While addressing these urgent practicalities, the structure achieves a ragged grace, with its oval form and undulating roof. Seen from a distance it looks like a union of a vital purpose and thoughtful design.

It combines solid and thin materials, and reused and new. There\u2019s not much you can do with it, apart from sit or perform on its stone steps.

But the architects wield these familiar tools with skill and sense, using concrete, rusty metal and reddish timber to effect the transition from robust exterior to reflective interior. Light is filtered through screens or descends from above. The ceremonial space envelops the congregation with wooden walls and ceiling that are also poised and geometrical. It gives the impression, at least from 6,000 miles away, of a warm if formal hug.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3fb433e56bfd62ebc1bedc1794caa26ac9df7562\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fb433e56bfd62ebc1bedc1794caa26ac9df7562/0_0_4986_3418/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fass school.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Full of delights\u2026 Toshiko Mori\u2019s Fass school.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Iwan Baan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/the-toshiko-mori-architect-designed-elementary-school-opens-in-dakar-senegal\">Fass school and teachers\u2019 residence, Fass, Senegal, by Toshiko Mori</a><br></strong>It\u2019s doughnut-shaped and made of local natural materials, and so might be compared to the Rohingya safe space, but there the likenesses end.

Without a doubt, a fear of debt is the main constraint on funding the current rescue operation and on making a boost to investment once the crisis is over.</p> <p>If you are a traditional Conservative MP with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/datablog/2013/apr/08/britain-changed-margaret-thatcher-charts\" title=\"\">picture of Margaret Thatcher</a> on the constituency office wall, you believe debts must be repaid, much like a domestic property mortgage.</p> <p>This is the household analogy Thatcher used to great effect during her years as prime minister, despite it being economically illiterate, and only ever deployed as a way to keep public spending in check and state power limited.</p> <p>Now, to tackle the coronavirus outbreak and nurse the economy until a vaccine is mass-produced, there is no choice but to watch the gap between spending and income soar.</p> <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates the government will need to borrow an extra \u00a3200bn in this financial year alone and is heading for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/thinktank-predicts-800bn-hit-to-economy-in-uk-over-next-10-years\" title=\"\">a debt-to-GDP ratio of 95%</a> from the current level of around 83%.</p> <p>A debt mountain that falls just short of the UK\u2019s \u00a32.2 trillion annual income is a level of borrowing that butts up against a significant psychological barrier \u2013 the three-figure debt-to-GDP ratio.</p> <p>In the mind of a conservative thinker, only countries that are reckless, and possibly morally dubious, have spent so much that their debts exceed 100% of GDP.</p> <p>In practical terms, a country with high debt levels can become the target of panicky investors, who can orchestrate a strike that means no one lends it money.</p> <p>A government borrows by issuing bonds with a maturity date, and it needs fresh lenders to step in and buy the debt from existing lenders each time it matures. \u201cBond vigilantes\u201d make money from orchestrating such bond-buying strikes and are ever watchful for countries that have left themselves vulnerable.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are too many savings in the world looking for a safe haven for the demand for bonds ever to fall</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The euro crisis is still fresh in many people\u2019s minds, when Italy and Greece found themselves bond-market pariahs. Italy\u2019s debts equalled 130% of GDP. Greece found itself with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 180%.</p> <p>George Osborne\u2019s career as chancellor, and his adherence to a debilitating austerity programme, was built on warnings that Britain could suffer the same fate as Greece and Italy. Like his hero Thatcher, he persuaded an anxious nation that debt was to be feared.</p> <p>Yet it was never true and is even less true today. Central to this argument is the path of interest rates. For the last 20 years in the UK and Europe, and the last 40 years in the US, interest rates on government debt have tumbled. Even though governments have borrowed more over time, the cost of financing each pound of debt has fallen.</p> <p>There was always the concern that interest rates could increase at some time, but it was never likely and most economists agree it cannot happen now, at least not for a decade or more. There are too many savings in the world looking for a safe haven for the demand for government bonds ever to fall, especially relative to stock markets or lending to corporations. That means the bond vigilantes have no leverage, except in the developing world. For the richer countries, there is always someone to borrow from.</p> <p>So, as the US and Japan have learned, it is not the size of your debts but how much they cost to service that matters. No wonder the US government debt-to-GDP ratio is at 110% and rising while Japan is a darling of the bond markets even though its government has a debt-to-GDP ratio above 250%.</p>",

  "<p>Tim Bray resigned as an Amazon vice-president last week. \u201cWho he?\u201d I hear you say. And why is this news significant? Answers: first, Bray is an ubergeek who\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Bray\">an alumnus</a> of many of the outfits in tech\u2019s hall of fame (including DEC, Sun Microsystems, the OED project at the University of Waterloo, Google\u2019s Android team and, eventually, Amazon Web Services); and second, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/04/amazon-tim-bray-resigns-working-conditions-coronavirus\">he resigned on an issue of </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/04/amazon-tim-bray-resigns-working-conditions-coronavirus\">principle</a></em> \u2013 something as rare as hen\u2019s teeth in the tech industry.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/04/29/Leaving-Amazon\">his blog</a>, he wrote: \u201cI quit in dismay at Amazon firing whistleblowers who were making noise about warehouse employees frightened of Covid-19.\u201d It was an expensive decision. Bray said the decision to resign would probably cost him more than a million dollars in salary and shares, and that he regretted leaving a job he enjoyed, working with good colleagues. \u201cSo I\u2019m pretty blue.\u201d</p> <p>The background to Bray\u2019s decision to leave his dream job as VP and distinguished engineer at Amazon Web Services was that Amazon had apparently fired several employees who had protested against the workplace conditions at warehouses amid the coronavirus pandemic. According to Bray, some employee activists responded by organising a petition and a video call on Thursday 16 April, featuring warehouse workers from around the world, along with guest activist the writer Naomi Klein. An announcement sent to internal mailing lists on 10 April was apparently the catalyst: Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa, two members of the internal campaign group Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, were dismissed that same day. Bray wrote that the justifications were \u201claughable\u201d and that it was obvious to any reasonable person that they were sacked for whistleblowing.</p> <p>At that point, said Bray, he snapped. He raised a complaint through internal channels, following company procedure. \u201cThat done, remaining an Amazon VP would have meant, in effect, signing off on actions I despised. So I resigned.\u201d</p> <p>A few points of clarification might be helpful. There are, in effect, two Amazons. Bray worked for Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company\u2019s vast and immensely profitable cloud computing platform. It was, he said, a very agreeable place to work. It treated its staff well, strove to allow them to achieve a proper work/life balance, made efforts to improve the diversity of the workforce, and was by and large an ethical organisation. More important, perhaps, AWS geeks have power. The average pay is very high, and anyone who is unhappy can easily get another job at a similar or better salary. So their employer has to handle them with care.</p> <p>But the events that led Bray to resign happened in the other bit of Amazon \u2013 the warehouse operation that has been serving as part of the critical infrastructure of economies under lockdown. He said it was all about the balance of power. The warehouse workers were weak and becoming ever weaker, given that coronavirus was fuelling mass unemployment and because, in the US, health insurance was often linked to your job. \u201cSo they\u2019re gonna get treated like crap, because [that\u2019s] capitalism. Any plausible solution has to start with increasing their collective strength.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39987d846d3dd01c67364d327ab4886b3953c2b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39987d846d3dd01c67364d327ab4886b3953c2b3/0_142_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon staff often have to inspect and scan hundreds of packages an hour.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amazon staff often have to inspect and scan hundreds of packages an hour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Mohatt/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It does, but making it happen would require overcoming the vehement opposition of the big tech companies \u2013 who regard unionisation the way the rest of us regard crocodiles. Amazon happens to be especially prominent in this regard, but that\u2019s because \u2013 unlike other tech giants \u2013 it actually employs huge numbers of people doing relatively mundane (but, as we now realise, critical) work. There have been numerous media reports about how pressurised work can be in its warehouses \u2013 reports that are invariably contested by the company. By comparison, the other tech giants get off relatively lightly, because they employ relatively few non-technical staff in proportion to their revenues and profits. But they don\u2019t want labour unions on their patches either.</p> <p>Ironically, though, we consumers don\u2019t seem to want unions either, especially if worker representation would lead to less pressurised working conditions in Amazon\u2019s and other warehouses. After all, it\u2019s our demands for near-instant gratification (AKA next-day delivery) that leads to a sorter on the outbound shipping dock of a warehouse having to inspect and scan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/05/amazon-workers-protest-unsafe-grueling-conditions-warehouse\">1,800 packages an hour</a> \u2013 that\u2019s 30 per minute \u2013 that are sent through a chute and transported on a conveyor belt before leaving on a truck for delivery. There was a time when I used to ask my teenage kids if they were happy buying a T-shirt in Primark at a price that meant that the worker in the Bangladeshi sweatshop who made it got less than a living wage. Maybe we should be asking the same questions for the things we order from Amazon.

  "<p>Anti-racism protesters have gathered outside a petrol station in Greater Manchester to demonstrate against the stun gun shooting by police of a black man in the company of his distressed son.</p> <p>Desmond Mombeyarara, 34, was shot with a stun gun by police on Wednesday evening after officers stopped him for allegedly speeding.</p> <p>Serious questions have been raised over the proportionality and justification for the initial decision to discharge the electronic weapon, the purpose of which is to incapacitate the individual so an officer can restrain them, amid growing concern about their disproportionate use against BAME people.</p> <p>Mombeyarara appeared in court on Friday and pleaded not guilty to two charges of obstructing or resisting a constable in the execution of duty, but admitted a number of other driving charges including speeding and being over the legal alcohol limit.</p> <p>He said he worked for the NHS but would not give further details and acknowledged he was in the wrong, but said the \u201cmagnitude of force\u201d was not warranted and that he had tried to reason with the police.</p> <p>\u201cI was saying to the officers: \u2018Let us calm the situation for the little one because the little one doesn\u2019t feel comfortable.\u2019 But they were making out like I was using him as a human shield,\u201d he told the Times.</p> <p>Describing the incident, he added: \u201cI lost consciousness, I was on the floor, I didn\u2019t know where I was \u2026 I was disorientated, I didn\u2019t have my glasses on and everything was blurred and my ears were echoing. I asked where my son was and they said he was in safe hands.\u201d</p> <p>On Saturday afternoon, a group of up to 15 people staged a physically distanced protest planned by Stand Up to Racism by the petrol station forecourt in Stretford.</p> <p>Paul Davidson, a minister at the Church of God of Prophecy, said: \u201cI am here because this news has outraged black people nationally \u2026 If the immediate clip is anything to go by then people have questions to answer and we should expect answers as a community. This sort of behaviour should not be expected by anyone in a civilised society.\u201d</p> <p>Vernetta O\u2019Loughlin, a social worker, said: \u201cThe incident will have caused the child a lot of distress and he will feel traumatised, but he won\u2019t be able to work out exactly what happened until he is older. It could have a long-term impact on his emotional and psychological wellbeing.\u201d</p> <p>The clip was shared widely on social media and showed the boy becoming hysterical and screaming: \u201cDaddy\u201d as Mombeyarara fell to the ground and convulsed as the stun gun was activated again.</p> <p>Mombeyarara said the boy\u2019s mother died in 2016 after a reaction to painkillers and that he was staying with his grandparents for the weekend. \u201cI have just had a video call with him and he is definitely still in shock,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was saying: \u2018They shot you.\u2019 He thought that they had shot me.\u201d</p> <p>The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, has questioned whether the use of a stun gun was \u201cproportionate or justified\u201d and demanded an urgent review.</p> <p>At Manchester magistrates court on Friday, Mombeyarara admitted speeding, being in charge of a motor vehicle whilst unfit through drink, using a motor vehicle without insurance; and being outside without reasonable excuse during the lockdown, according to the Manchester Evening News. A test showed he had 36 micrograms of alcohol per 100ml of breath. The legal limit is 35.</p> <p>Greater Manchester police has referred the matter to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.</p> <p>The police watchdog is investigating after another black man was left with a life-changing injury on Monday after he was shot with a stun gun by officers in London, from whom he was running away.</p>",

Right on cue, Jameela Jamil, who never misses an opportunity to opine on body image issues, strode into the debate. \u201cAdele would hate this so much,\u201d the actor and activist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jameelajamil/status/1258504640829681666?s=20\">tweeted</a> on Thursday, with a photo montage of Skinny Adele memes. \u201cI\u2019m so glad she isn\u2019t [on Twitter] to see people weaponize her body against women. These memes are everywhere. This is so offensive. So destructive. So reductive. It encourages us to demonize and become afraid of food.\u201d</p> <p>Those are all good points. Nevertheless, one does have to wonder exactly how helpful it is for Jamil to have shared the memes with her 1.1 million followers.</p> <p>You\u2019d think that during a once-in-a-century pandemic that is devastating the world we\u2019d all have gained a little perspective. You\u2019d think that we might have lost interest in how much a celebrity weighs. Alas, policing female bodies and appetites is a timeless trend. We\u2019ve been doing it since Eve was shamed for gluttonously eating that apple and, no doubt, we\u2019ll be doing it until we get hit by an asteroid or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/pentagon-releases-three-ufo-videos-taken-by-us-navy-pilots\">aliens arrive</a> to put us all out of our misery. Despite all the progress there has been around gender equality much of the world is still more interested in what goes into a woman\u2019s mouth than what comes out of it.</p> <h2>Jacob Wohl is at the centre of yet another fake sexual assault allegation</h2> <p>The pro-Trump smear artist reportedly <a href=\"https://reason.com/2020/05/07/she-said-anthony-fauci-sexually-assaulted-her-now-she-says-jacob-wohl-and-jack-burkman-paid-her-to-lie/\">paid</a> a woman called Diana Andrade to pretend that Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, had sexually assaulted her. Andrade initially went through with the plan but then had second thoughts and blew the whistle. Wohl, and his equally odious sidekick Jack Burkman, have a history of trying to (very badly) fabricate sexual harassment allegations against the likes of Robert Mueller, Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren. Last year he claimed that Warren had paid for an S&amp;M relationship with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/05/go-cougars-elizabeth-warren-gave-the-classiest-response-to-a-rightwing-trolls-lie\">twentysomething marine.</a> Wohl is a complete joke but his antics do a lot of damage to the credibility of sexual assault survivors.</p> <h2>Betsy DeVos revises campus sexual assault legislation</h2> <p>The US education secretary (and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/26/betsy-devos-yacht-vandalism-protest\">owner of multiple yachts</a>) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/06/betsy-devos-sexual-assault-title-ix-rules\">has issued new rules on sexual assault in schools and colleges</a>; equal rights groups argue these revisions \u201ctip the scales in favor\u201d of abusers and reduce the rights of survivors.

  "<p>Maturity is an often derided concept in a youth-facing art form. But when <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSj5k2K7w0\">Simmer</a>, a song about repressed feminist rage buoyed by creepy electronics \u2013 the lead track from Hayley Williams\u2019s debut solo album \u2013 was released in January, it signalled an intriguing sea change in an artist previously known as a bouncy, flame-haired emo cheerleader.</p> <p>The story of how Hayley Williams, now 31, went from leading <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCyGvGEtOwc\">angsty emo shoutalongs</a> in the Tennessee pop-punk band Paramore to releasing these startling songs about rage, femininity and suicidal thoughts is one of the knottier yarns in contemporary American guitar music. Her trio-of-EPs album is now complete, with the final EP \u2013 and a physical album uniting all three \u2013 released last Friday.</p> <p><em>Petals </em><em>for Armor</em> is not about Williams\u2019s time with Paramore, per se, but her recovery from a band she had been in since her teens, an outfit run on equal parts camaraderie and acrimony, tinged by God and latterday poptimist repositioning.</p> <p>From teenage beginnings, Paramore grew into one of the genre\u2019s premier arena-fillers, via endless Vans-sponsored touring festivals and umpteen packets of <a href=\"https://gooddyeyoung.com/\">bright hair dye</a>. Echoing Blondie in the early 80s, Williams would scrawl \u201c<a href=\"https://www.spin.com/2008/02/paramore-band/\">Paramore Is A Band</a>\u201d on her T-shirt (she was signed as a solo act, but insisted on forming a band). When Williams and her <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/2161638/taylor-swift-mom-hayley-williams-friends/\">good buddy Taylor Swift</a> first met, at a Grammys party in 2008, Williams was arguably nearly as big in her own sphere as her Nashville peer was in hers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A personal and artistic reboot, Petals for Armor processes, post-therapy, everything Williams has been through</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Certainly, the Paramore singer held an early lead on drama as fuel for songs. In just one minor subplot, Paramore\u2019s bassist left, returned and eventually left again, <a href=\"https://eu.tennessean.com/story/money/2017/05/11/paramore-former-bassist-jeremy-davis-settle-legal-dispute/318276001/\">a lawsuit in his wake</a>. In 2010, original guitarist Josh Farro left the band with his drummer brother, Zac, calling Paramore, not without some justification, \u201ca manufactured product\u201d, and accusing Williams, less quantifiably, of insufficient godliness. The fact that Farro and Williams had been in a semi-unrecognised relationship \u2013 see Paramore\u2019s 2009\u2019s <em>Brand New Eyes</em> LP \u2013 just added to the feeling of watching a soap opera with gnarlier chord play.</p> <p>By the time Paramore made 2017\u2019s redefining <em>After Laughter</em>, Zac Farro was back; Williams had divorced her partner of nearly a decade; Paramore\u2019s second guitarist, Taylor York, was playing lead and producing; and the band had pivoted away from moshpits towards a zesty, early <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEB6ibtdPZc\">80s-indebted funk-pop</a> that barely masked some seriously bleak lyrics.</p> <p>Williams\u2019s label, Atlantic, played a very long game because now, after <em>After Laughter</em>, it finally has a Hayley Williams solo album, <em>Petals </em><em>for Armor</em>, whose theme is strength through vulnerability.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lSj5k2K7w0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8lSj5k2K7w0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://youtu.be/8lSj5k2K7w0\">Watch the video for Simmer.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Williams\u2019s output has grown up immeasurably. Sudden Desire is a borderline R&amp;B song about female lust, a theme that contrasts markedly with Paramore\u2019s careful messaging. An overarching concern on <em>Petals</em>\u2026 is how Williams constructs a workable new femininity free from her old tomboy identity in Paramore. The blooming metaphor is, as a result, slightly overplayed throughout. But songs such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omHdRlpmqyg\">Roses/Lotus/Violet/Iris</a>, with its theme of female solidarity \u2013 emphasised by Phoebe Bridgers, Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus (AKA <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/nov/10/one-to-watch-boygenius-lucy-dacus-phoebe-bridges-julien-baker\">Boygenius</a>) on backing vocals \u2013 just avoids gilding that lily too much.</p> <p>A personal and artistic reboot, <em>Petals </em><em>for Armor</em> processes, post-therapy, everything Williams has been through \u2013 Paramore, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/12/paramores-hayley-williams-a-lot-of-my-depression-was-misplaced-anger\">the trauma laid down in Williams\u2019s childhood</a>, when her mother had to escape an abusive partner, and Williams\u2019s own various relationship breakdowns. The black squares that adorn Williams\u2019s hand on her album\u2019s artwork hide the tattooed-over initials of her former husband.</p> <p>All these factors sent Williams close to the edge. In an Apple Music interview last February, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTuq6_bqUEk\">she told Zane Lowe</a> that only the thought of her dog waiting for her in vain quelled her suicidal thoughts. A tremendous song such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABRlosiCsM\">Leave It Alone</a>, which mixes acoustic guitar with strings, treats these dark matters gently, with Williams imagining new uses for \u201cthe noose that she made\u201d (\u201cturn it into a fire escape\u201d).</p> <p>If the floral theme can feel a little much, the experimentation sometimes struggles to hit the right note. Watch Me While I Bloom starts as a surprise, Bj\u00f6rk-like explosion of self-love and slithering electronics and<strong> </strong>develops into Janet Jackson funk. It\u2019s not wrong, but on those funkier occasions when Williams turns to face the mainstream, she loses her individuality. Pure Lover is one tune where the hard-won wisdom of her lyrics \u2013 \u201cIf I want pure love, must stop acting so tough\u201d \u2013 is lost in a swirl of textbook funk-pop. The refusal to sit with any genre longer than a few bars confuses just as often as it impresses.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZkVaM-0K8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eIZkVaM-0K8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZkVaM-0K8\">Watch the video for Dead Horse by Hayley Williams</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Most courageously, however, this is not the sort of Damascene pop conversion where Williams dallies with all the A-list producers du jour, as Gwen Stefani, a trailblazer of sorts, did when her first band, No Doubt, ended. Although there are a couple of low-key co-writes, Williams and York remain the organising creatives, and Williams sounds both free and in control.</p> <p>The unfettered glee with which these former pop-punk lifers go about renewal is striking, never more so than on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x7jORhJntM\">Cinnamon</a>. Here, upfront percussion, Williams\u2019s vocals and paranoid electronics bounce off one another on a song about the spooky house she moved into, alone, after her divorce.

That\u2019s the kind of stuff where you begin to get worried that basic \u2013 not just institutional norms \u2013 but our basic understanding of rule of law is at risk.</p> <p>\u201cAnd when you start moving in those directions, it can accelerate pretty quickly as we\u2019ve seen in other places.\u201d</p> <p>The president has repeatedly blamed Obama for the FBI investigation into Russian election interference which expanded to include links between his campaign and Moscow. Last week, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/04/don-lemon-trump-cnn-coronavirus-conspiracy-theories\">retweeted a conspiracy theorist</a> who claimed Obama directed the investigation.</p> <p>On Thursday Trump said at the White House: \u201cWhat they did, what the Obama administration did, is unprecedented \u2026 and I hope a lot of people will pay a big price because they are dishonest, crooked people. They are scum, human scum.\u201d</p> <p>The president added: \u201c[Flynn] was targeted by the Obama administration, and he was targeted in order to try to take down a president.\u201d</p> <p>After nearly two years of work, special counsel Robert Mueller did not establish a criminal conspiracy but did detail extensive links between Trump aides and Russians and numerous instances of possible obstruction of justice by the president.</p> <p>Trump claims exoneration by Mueller. Mueller said he was not exonerating Trump.</p> <p>Flynn\u2019s guilty plea to lying to the FBI was one of Mueller\u2019s biggest coups. In 2017 Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/937007006526959618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E937007006526959618&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2020%2Fmay%2F07%2Fmichael-flynn-criminal-case-trump-russia\">acknowledged</a> it, writing on Twitter: \u201cI had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice-President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!\u201d</p> <p>According to Yahoo News, Obama told the web call the case made him feel a \u201csense of urgency\u201d about November\u2019s election, in which Trump is set to face Joe Biden, Obama\u2019s vice-president.</p> <p>\u201cWhenever I campaign,\u201d Obama reportedly said, \u201cI\u2019ve always said, \u2018Ah, this is the most important election.\u2019 Especially obviously when I was on the ballot, that always feels like it\u2019s the most important election. This one, I\u2019m not on the ballot but I am pretty darn invested. We got to make this happen.\u201d</p> <p>Obama reportedly said the election would be about fighting \u201clong-term trends in which being selfish, being tribal, being divided, and seeing others as an enemy [have] become a stronger impulse in American life\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of the reason,\u201d he reportedly said, \u201cwhy the response to this global crisis [the coronavirus outbreak] has been so anaemic and spotty. It would have been bad even with the best of governments. It has been an absolute chaotic disaster when that mindset of \u2018what\u2019s in it for me\u2019 and \u2018to heck with everybody else\u2019, when that mindset is operationalised in our government.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why, I, by the way, am going to be spending as much time as necessary and campaigning as hard as I can for Joe Biden.\u201d</p> <p>As of Saturday morning, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, 1,283,762 cases of Covid-19 had been confirmed in the US, with 77,175 deaths. Encouraged by the White House, more than half the 50 states are seeking to reopen their shuttered economies, despite warnings from public health experts that it is too soon to do so without risking a high death toll.</p> <p>Obama has followed precedent in not criticising his successor in the Oval Office in public but reports of his view of Trump are fairly regular. In January, for example, it was reported that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/27/obama-warned-trump-fascist-2016-hulu-film-hillary-clinton-sundance\">he said Trump was a fascist</a>.</p> <p>On Saturday Trump was at the White House. He did not immediately respond to the Yahoo News report.</p> <p>However the attorney general, William Barr, perhaps spoke for the president earlier when he was <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/attorney-general-william-barr-on-michael-flynn-obamacare-and-coronavirus-restrictions-transcript/\">asked</a> how he thought history would view his decision to drop the Flynn case.</p> <p>\u201cWell, history is written by the winner,\u201d he told CBS News. \u201cSo it largely depends on who\u2019s writing the history.\u201d<br></p>",

  "<p>If it\u2019s a balmy evening and you hear buzzing in the sky over Rathdrinagh, a townland in the middle of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland\"> Ireland</a>, the odds are that it\u2019s not bees but beer.</p> <p>Specifically, a drone carrying bottles of beer, and maybe a bag of crisps. \u201cBottles of Heineken usually, or sometimes a few cans of Bulmers,\u201d said Avril McKeever.</p> <p>She is the owner of McKeever\u2019s Bar &amp; Lounge, a 152-year-old pub that serves a rural community 30 miles north of Dublin. It used to offer drink, food and craic, but then came the coronavirus lockdown, so now it offers aerial delivery.</p> <p>The drone, operated by McKeever\u2019s nephew-in-law, Paul Clarke, criss-crosses the neighbourhood, bottles dangling from a string. \u201cWe had a bottle of wine and a bag of Tayto crisps ready to go last night but it didn\u2019t take off because of the wind,\u201d McKeever said last week.</p> <p>The innovation is whimsy, a way to stay connected with customers, but is part of a deadly serious struggle for survival confronting Ireland\u2019s 7,000 pubs.</p> <p>When the pandemic hit Ireland in March, pubs were among the first businesses to close, leaving 50,000 workers without jobs and the population bereft of a part of Irish culture.</p> <p>Seven weeks later, a question mark hangs over when \u2013 or even if \u2013 pubs will reopen.</p> <p>They have taken a big financial hit by missing the \u201cgoldrush\u201d weekends around St Patrick\u2019s day and Six Nations rugby matches, lost beer that went stale, and faced ongoing pressure to pay rent and utilities. </p> <p>Under the Irish government\u2019s lockdown roadmap, they may be able to reopen on 10 August but customers\u2019 fear of infection plus social distancing rules could yet sabotage any revival. Donal O\u2019Keeffe, the chief executive of the Licensed Vintners Association (LVA), called the rules a \u201ccomplete nightmare\u201d for pubs.</p> <p>Which raises a question: can a business model premised on bringing people together exist in an era of staying apart?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s terrible to see your pub empty, it\u2019s like a death in the family</p> <footer> <cite>Mark Grainger, Dublin publican</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ireland\u2019s pubs have faced challenges before. The temperance movement, depopulation, political upheaval and economic boom-and-bust all took their toll. But the survivors adapted and thrived.</p> <p>Covid-19 presents an existential threat. Former customers have become used to stocking up at supermarkets and drinking at home. How many will return to pay higher prices and risk infection in pubs stripped of bustle and atmosphere?</p> <p>Pubs are responding as best they can. For McKeever, the drone deliveries are a way to lift spirits \u2013 no pun intended \u2013 and nourish her bar\u2019s connection to the community. </p> <p>Other pubs are racking up brisk sales by delivering pints to customers\u2019 doorsteps. \u201cYou ring up, order pints and pay with a credit card,\u201d said Mark Grainger, owner of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/graingershanlonscorner/\">Graingers Hanlons Corner</a>, a Dublin pub which has pioneered the strategy.</p> <p>Staff pull the pints \u2013 usually Guinness \u2013 seal the glasses and put them in a coolbox. Drivers with gloves and masks deliver them within the 5km radius permitted by lockdown rules. \u201cThe pint would be perfect. We\u2019re now nearly six weeks in and not had one complaint,\u201d said Grainger.</p> <p>Orders come from all over the world \u2013 Britain, the US, Australia, Dubai \u2013 as the Irish diaspora seizes on the chance to send some love, in the form of drinks and cooked meals, to Dublin relatives in lockdown. \u201cIt\u2019s good business-wise but not as good as if the pub was open. It\u2019s survival. If we didn\u2019t do it, we wouldn\u2019t be getting any income,\u201d said Grainger.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9656e5b6b02f7e76efe485629199ce755fc480dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9656e5b6b02f7e76efe485629199ce755fc480dc/0_178_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Grainger owner of Graingers pub in Dublin delivers pints of Guinness\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Grainger, of Graingers pub in Dublin, delivering pints of Guinness to a customer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niall Carson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One publican has installed a keg and pump in a van so he can pull pints at customers\u2019 houses. The Big Romance, a north Dublin pub, takes orders online and dispatches drivers with two-pint \u201cgrowler\u201d bottles.</p> <p>These are emergency measures. Survival hinges on reinvention in a Covid-19 world.</p> <p>A survey found that six out of 10 Dublin pub owners fear their businesses will founder if forced to stay closed for the rest of the year \u2013 a prospect flagged by the Irish health minister, Simon Harris, who suggested full reopening may need to await a Covid-19 vaccine.</p> <p>Hope of sorts came last week when the government\u2019s lockdown roadmap proposed letting pubs open on 10 August. Physical distancing measures, however, will increase costs and shrink revenue.</p> <p>Last week, the LVA and the Vintners\u2019 Federation of Ireland, which represents publicans outside Dublin, submitted a request to let pubs open in June \u2013 with cafes and restaurants \u2013 on the promise of a new type of pub: no more than four people per 10 square metres, no more than six per table, no live music or DJ, no sitting, standing or ordering at the bar, using hand sanitiser upon entry and staff keeping distance from customers.</p> <p>The government is reviewing the proposals. No one knows how many pubs will cope with such restrictions.</p> <p>Mark Grainger\u2019s pub used to draw 300 people on a Saturday night but will have to limit that to 70, he said. He is installing partitions, converting a bar area into a newsagent\u2019s \u2013 and crossing his fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible to see your pub empty, it\u2019s like a death in the family. We have to do what we have to do \u2026 That\u2019s the deck of cards we\u2019ve been dealt.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Couples who have been unable to get married because of the coronavirus lockdown have had their wedding insurance claims rejected \u2013 in some cases despite being assured they were covered before buying their policy.</p> <p>The Guardian has heard from people who have lost thousands when claims were turned down by provider WeddingPlan Insurance.</p> <p>Lidia and her partner Adam were due to get married on 4 April, after the lockdown had begun.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/01/coronavirus-has-put-our-20000-trip-to-costa-rica-in-jeopardy\">Coronavirus has put our \u00a320,000 trip to Costa Rica in jeopardy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They became concerned that their plans would be affected in early March and looked for insurance that would offer cover against cancellation due to coronavirus. After checking with WeddingPlan that they would qualify, they bought a \u00a357 policy and made payments to caterers and other suppliers.</p> <p>\u201cOn 21 March the venue told us they would not be able to hold our wedding because they couldn\u2019t guarantee the safety of staff,\u201d Lidia says. \u201cThen on 23 March came lockdown, and everything was officially shut down.\u201d</p> <p>They asked about a new date next summer, but the price will be much higher. The caterers said they had prepared most of the food and they will not survive if they give a refund.</p> <p>The couple, who marked their planned wedding day with drinks in the garden and a Zoom call with friends and family, made a claim for just under \u00a310,000 to cover costs they cannot recover. Emails seen by Guardian Money show they were told they could make a claim if the wedding had to be cancelled as a result of an infectious disease. \u201cThe rejection says they won\u2019t pay out because the venue was closed as a result of a government act,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the cancellation was made before the legislation went through.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c63f2906ca179791a29e57f4d07fdade70c763b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c63f2906ca179791a29e57f4d07fdade70c763b7/0_770_2448_1469/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lidia and her partner Adam\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lidia and her partner Adam had their claim for just under \u00a310,000 rejected.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lidia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Others have had their claims turned down. Debenhams wedding insurance customers appear to be in the same position, as both brands are operated by UK General.

In an FAQ section on its website in late March, it said: \u201cIf the government or relevant body cancels all public gatherings due to coronavirus, would the cancellation or postponement of my wedding be covered?\u201d. The response is: \u201cYes, if the venue was closed due to general outbreak of infectious disease, where the government issues a notice, this would fall under \u2018closure of the venue by the relevant authority\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Many, like Lidia, had also been reassured by email and phone.</p> <p>Annie was due to get married on Saturday 21 March \u2013 before the lockdown began but the day after the government announced pubs and hotels would have to close. \u201cThe photographer pulled out because he was in the vulnerable group, and the guests were dropping like flies,\u201d she says. So they checked with WeddingPlan, and were assured they would be able to claim.</p> <p>After setting up the venue on the Friday, they watched the press briefing announcing the first round of closures, and at 7pm got a call to say the venue would have to close. The couple had planned a church wedding and, with family gathered for the event, they called the insurer to ask if they could still claim for loss of the reception if they went ahead with the legal part of the day. Thanks to a vicar with a tape measure, they were allowed to marry, but with none of the celebrations.</p> <p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t claiming for a photographer, because we had pictures of the ceremony. We are claiming for flowers for the table, but not for the bouquets. But it was too late to postpone, so we had to pay for the food and the venue.\u201d</p> <p>Their \u00a320,000 claim has also been rejected because the insurer said the venue was forced to close by a government act. They contest that, saying the law did not come into effect until after their wedding date, and that the insurer\u2019s website initially said it would take claims in these circumstances. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had the wedding we planned, and we have paid full price for it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b84a5f0cea5590748f927951beac188e035c058\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b84a5f0cea5590748f927951beac188e035c058/0_36_1440_864/1000.jpg\" alt=\"screengrab image issued by Ben Jackson  and Sophie Austin of the school sweethearts getting married over Zoom video chat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some couples have got married over Zoom video chat after the coronavirus lockdown made their dream wedding impossible.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Jackson/Sophie Austin/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>UK General says it did not underwrite the policies and was a distributor of a number of insurance products \u201cso we do not have the final say in whether or not a claim is paid\u201d.</p> <p>It adds: \u201cWe acknowledge that our customers expect to be able to make a claim on their wedding insurance policy as a result of having to postpone their wedding, and when their claim is turned down it is extremely upsetting ... A pandemic cover, for situations such as for Covid-19, was not written into wedding policies, and policies were thus not priced to cover pandemics. The policy is intended to cover localised issues, such as a local authority closing a specific venue following an outbreak of food poisoning. A government-imposed lockdown is not, and was never intended, to be part of the cover provided under this policy.\u201d</p> <p>UK General says anyone who has had a claim turned down can use its complaints process and the Financial Ombudsman Service.</p> <h2>What does the law say about demands to pay?</h2> <p>Couples who put down deposits for weddings that have had to be cancelled due to the lockdown have faced aggressive demands from venues to pay their final bills \u2013 which can easily be \u00a312,000-\u00a317,000 \u2013 for a wedding that can no longer take place.</p> <p>Faced with such a demand what should you? James Cronin, a director at the Cheltenham law firm Eight Legal, advises couples against handing over any more money. Instead, he says, they may want to argue that the original contract to provide the wedding venue has been frustrated.</p> <p>\u201cIf a contract exists for a wedding or holiday which is now impossible to perform in a way that resembled the original terms agreed between the parties in any meaningful way, a letter arguing that the contract has been frustrated and referring to the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943 may well help,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cFrustration applies when an unforeseeable event would make it impossible to perform the contract at all or on terms which bore any real commercial resemblance to those agreed between the parties. If one party has benefited considerably prior to the frustrating event \u2013 covid cancellation - a judge is allowed to apportion some or all of the benefits to the other party if this would result in a fair outcome.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f39b9e609701d786df18775185bafa4bfe13f45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f39b9e609701d786df18775185bafa4bfe13f45/0_85_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Champagne and chairs are set up for a wedding\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Which? says it has received complaints from couples about wedding venue cancellations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James D Morgan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Consumer rights group Which? says it has received complaints from couples about wedding venue cancellations.</p> <p>\u201cIt is unacceptable that some venues are refusing to provide any refund of couples\u2019 significant upfront deposits or charging customers extortionate fees, particularly when it is not the couples\u2019 decision to cancel,\u201d said Adam French, consumer rights editor at Which?.</p> <p>\u201cWhile many businesses will be struggling during this difficult time, it does not seem fair for customers to be charged fees or left thousands of pounds out of pocket for a service the venue can\u2019t deliver.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Miles Brignall</strong></p>",

The warning signs are there, she says. \u201cYou read some of the things people were saying then, and you can find people saying the exact same thing today.\u201d</p> <p>In her homeland, run by far-right president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jair-bolsonaro\" title=\"\">Jair Bolsonaro</a>, the then culture minister Roberto Alvim recently borrowed heavily from Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi minister for propaganda during the second world war, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/17/brazil-culture-minister-goebbels-roberto-alvim-nazi\" title=\"\">in a speech</a>: \u201cBrazilian art in the next decade will be heroic and national, he said, as Wagner played in the background (he was later sacked).</p> <p>\u201cThings like that motivate me to keep doing my job,\u201d Amaral says. \u201cIt\u2019s why I believe in the value and importance of colourising photos. Only when people really understand what happened, and why, will they be able to do something, to not let those moments or those radical people rise again and transform the world into something ugly and unbearable.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44200d911699a2aba0f112a0505d4bce54756ea6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44200d911699a2aba0f112a0505d4bce54756ea6/0_0_4824_4008/1000.jpg\" alt=\"5th London Rifle Brigade soldiers with German Saxon regimental troops at Ploegsteert Wood, on the western front, during the Christmas truce in 1914: black and white image coloured by artist Marina Amaral\" width=\"1000\" height=\"831\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">5th London Rifle Brigade soldiers with German Saxon regimental troops during the Christmas truce in 1914.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>5th London Rifle Brigade soldiers with German Saxon regimental troops during the Christmas truce in 1914.

Bolsonaro has dismissed coronavirus as media \u201chysteria\u201d and a \u201cbit of a cold\u201d, shunned social distancing, and even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/jair-bolsonaro-dictatorship-rally-protest-brazil-president-denounced\" title=\"\">joined his supporters in anti-lockdown protests</a>. \u201cI think he will commit mistakes that will cost the lives of many people,\u201d Amaral says. When we speak, her grandmother isn\u2019t well; they don\u2019t know if it\u2019s virus-related, but she\u2019s worried. \u201cI\u2019m scared, to be honest.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>The story of how Marina Amaral came to colour in the past is a very 21st century one. When she was 12, she had a blog and wanted to add some graphics. She didn\u2019t know how, nor did she know anyone who could help. So, using YouTube tutorials, she taught herself to use Photoshop, which she has been exploring ever since.</p> <p>A degree in international relations was abandoned; it didn\u2019t excite her. But her mother is a historian and Amaral has always been fascinated by the past. After stumbling across an online collection of colourised photographs of the second world war, she decided to have a go herself. Sourcing pictures from free image libraries, she developed her own Photoshop techniques and published the results on Facebook and Twitter, where she soon gained large followings. That\u2019s where Dan Jones came across her. The historian saw what she had done to a <a href=\"https://marinamaral.com/portfolio/lewis-powell/\" title=\"\">photograph of Lewis Powell</a>, one of the men executed in 1865 for conspiring to assassinate Abraham Lincoln, his vice-president and the secretary of state (Amaral transformed Powell from a nondescript 19th-century Confederate soldier into a smouldering James Dean). Jones got in touch, the rest is\u2026 well, you know what. In colour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"517b3116eb422f12d8c17aba7f9664d99196797e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/517b3116eb422f12d8c17aba7f9664d99196797e/0_0_4064_3272/1000.jpg\" alt=\"American soldiers disembark on Omaha beach in Normandy on D-day, June 1944: black and white image coloured by artist Marina Amaral\" width=\"1000\" height=\"805\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">American soldiers disembark on Omaha beach in Normandy on D-day, June 1944.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert F Sargent/Getty images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>American soldiers disembark on Omaha beach in Normandy on D-day, June 1944.

Historical research is the most important part of the process. \u201cBefore I sit down and start colourising a photo, I will analyse it deeply, often with the help of historians and experts, gathering as much detail and information as possible and cross-referencing it all with visual and written descriptions of the time. I have to dig to find pieces of a puzzle and fill in the gaps.\u201d</p> <p>The process can be time-consuming, depending on the number of details and the complexity of the image. \u201cI will spend hours, days or weeks working on a single photo. There are some that do not work in colour for various reasons \u2013 maybe the original was damaged, or it just doesn\u2019t look right \u2013 so then we have to discard it and start again. It\u2019s important to have an artistic eye, otherwise the photograph will not look real.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes, the result looks less like a picture taken in the last couple of months and more like one painted centuries ago. Her colourised photograph of the Russian dancer <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ida-Rubinstein\" title=\"\">Ida Rubinstein</a> volunteering as a nurse in Paris at the start of the first world war, has something of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/29/jan-van-eyck-arnolfini-portrait-make-art-come-alive\" title=\"\">Van Eyck\u2019s Arnolfini Portrait</a> about it.</p> <p>The most powerful of the 200 photographs in the book are not the loudest ones: the action, horror, the famous and infamous faces. I\u2019m not sure what it adds to know that the hole in Mussolini\u2019s head leaked what looks like pink blancmange on to the body of his girlfriend, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Petacci\" title=\"\">Claretta Petacci</a>. Robert F Sargent\u2019s famous D-day photograph, <a href=\"https://www.visitthecapitol.gov/exhibitions/artifact/jaws-death-photograph-d-day-normandy-landing-robert-f-sargent-june-6-1944\" title=\"\">Into The Jaws Of Death</a>, of American soldiers disembarking on Omaha beach, is powerful in colour \u2013 but no more so than it is in black and white. More startling is another landing craft photo, of US troops in Operation Torch, the 1942 invasion of North Africa, because this one was taken <a href=\"http://ww2today.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Torch-landing-craft.jpg\" title=\"\">into the faces of the soldiers</a>. One face in particular: a blue-eyed boy who looks about 15, stares into the camera. Is that fear? What happened to him, you wonder? What was his name?</p> <p>For me, Amaral\u2019s colourisation process is most moving when applied to pictures of children. The addition of eye colour, skin tone, freckles \u2013 suddenly, they look like children you might know. And children, especially, relate to her colourised pictures because they are witnessing a reality that is more similar to their own, she says. Amaral\u2019s day is made when teachers email to say her work has helped their history classes, or engaged their students more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5ba44c5f4ad3c15f0570882da3530560840f005\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5ba44c5f4ad3c15f0570882da3530560840f005/0_0_2958_1359/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A triple head shot of 14-year-old Czeslawa Kwoka, photographed at Auschwitz\" width=\"1000\" height=\"459\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s very powerful in black and white\u2019: 14-year-old Czeslawa Kwoka, photographed at Auschwitz...</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Auschwitz Memorial and Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"21e8bf216042f99e3ad85aeeeff1390b4b00cde9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21e8bf216042f99e3ad85aeeeff1390b4b00cde9/0_0_2741_1193/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A triple head shot of 14-year-old Czeslawa Kwoka, photographed at Auschwitz: black and white image coloured by artist Marina Amaral\" width=\"1000\" height=\"435\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Czeslawa Kwoka, 14, photographed at Auschwitz.

He is surrounded by a group of adoring boys. They are mostly very fair, and one is wearing lederhosen; otherwise, they could be the scout group that meets down the road. They are all members of the Hitler Youth.</p> <p>But the most haunting picture shows another child, 14-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/27/the-holocaust-is-not-your-metaphor-to-use-in-modern-political-debates\" title=\"\">Czeslawa Kwoka</a>, who was murdered at Auschwitz. It was, Amaral says, one of the most difficult pictures she\u2019s worked on. \u201cIt\u2019s very powerful in black and white, but in colour you can see that her lips are bleeding. She had just been beaten by a guard. You can really see the fear in her eyes, but you can also feel her courage. Colour allows us to understand the reality in a much deeper sense.\u201d</p> <p>The photograph of Czeslawa Kwoka is also part of a special project Amaral is involved in, <a href=\"https://facesofauschwitz.com/\" title=\"\">Faces Of Auschwitz</a>, a collaboration with the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum, for which she is colourising registration photographs from the museum\u2019s archive. It\u2019s the hardest work she has done, she says: \u201cBut I think it\u2019s also necessary. They send me the pictures but also the documents, so I have to spend hours looking at their faces, knowing that, after the photo was taken, they were murdered. I need to have that feeling, otherwise I will be transformed into a machine and the whole purpose will be lost.\u201d</p> <p>Amaral knows that colourisation isn\u2019t for everyone. Some see it as ersatz or interfering, even sacrilege. But it isn\u2019t a matter of choosing one or the other, she says. \u201cMy intention is not to replace the original, but to give people the opportunity to see history from a different perspective.\u201d Also to see it more as the photographer saw it, and the way it actually was. The photographer might not have had the choice, or the technology, to take a picture in colour. But looking through the viewfinder, that\u2019s what they saw; the past \u2013 even its grimmest, darkest hours \u2013 was not in black and white.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://headofzeus.com/books/9781789542028\" title=\"\">The World Aflame</a>, by Marina Amaral and Dan Jones, is published by Head of Zeus on 14 May at \u00a325.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 10 May 2020.

It\u2019s not an individual sport and you need to do things sometimes that are not in your comfort zone, or that are not in your best interests, for the greater good of the team.</p> \n   <p>That\u2019s what great teams are built on ...

Fellow Titan <strong>Nathan Peats</strong> and Manly\u2019s<strong> Marty Taupau</strong> both hesitated to get the shot due to past adverse reactions, but eventually had the injection.</p> \n  <p>As of Saturday afternoon, the Titans were still awaiting confirmation from Cartwright and Kelly over whether they would agree to be immunised and resume training.</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s understood <strong>Dylan Walker</strong>, <strong>Addin Fonua-Blake</strong>, <strong>Josh Papalii</strong>, <strong>Joseph Tapine</strong>, <strong>Iosia Soliola</strong> and Canterbury\u2019s <strong>Sione Katoa </strong>all signed a waiver to remain compliant under the NRL\u2019s guidelines and continue training.</p> \n  <p>It has sparked confusion over how different states and territories will enforce the NRL\u2019s return to training protocols, and casts doubt over whether unimmunised players will be allowed to play in Queensland.</p> \n  <p>Graham, who sits on the RLPA\u2019s board of directors, said the confusion was always a risk as the game rushed to resume training. He believes players and clubs could have sacrificed another week of training as a team to ensure these loose ends in the biosecurity guidelines were tied up.</p> \n  <p>Should the NRL decide to bow to government pressure and enact a \u2018no jab, no play\u2019 policy, Graham says players will need to consider the strength of their convictions against their livelihoods.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I know for me, if I don\u2019t like a flu jab, if it puts my livelihood at risk preventing me from making some money to feed my family, I\u2019m getting the flu jab.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019s simple in my eyes ... It depends on how strong their convictions are on an individual level. If they want to sacrifice their rugby league game for their personal preference not to get a flu shot, that\u2019s their prerogative.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a52fa0f2edbd31f05fe57c073d4ffff8b27a9e93\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a52fa0f2edbd31f05fe57c073d4ffff8b27a9e93/0_18_3448_2068/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nathan Peats (centre) at a Gold Coast Titans training session on Saturday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nathan Peats (centre) at a Gold Coast Titans training session on Saturday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Hunt/AAP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-09T06:58:57.411Z\">at 7.58am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb64bbc8f0858b1a8106e0f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-09T06:21:04.369Z\">7.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The deputy chief medical officer, <strong>Paul Kelly</strong>, has also doubt on the chances of fans attending finals footy this year \u2013 another rubbing of salt into an already heavily seasoned wound.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There are some iconic moments in Australian sport coming up in that period \u2013 the last weekend in September is dear to many of us.

Dfat staff in Canberra and at posts abroad have been committed to providing Australians with practical solutions to return to Australia.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-09T03:37:44.721Z\">at 4.37am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb623588f0858b1a8106d7d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-09T03:28:47.819Z\">4.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Five new cases in NSW</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The NSW Health department has released updated Covid-19 statistics, which are current up to 8pm on Friday.<br></p> \n  <p>There have been five new cases recorded in NSW, bringing the state\u2019s total to 3,051.<br></p> \n  <p>NSW has also set a new record for a single day, with 13,692 tests conducted in the previous 24 hours.

(Cognisant that last week the federal education minister <strong>Dan Tehan</strong> similarly attacked Andrews \u2013 over school closures \u2013 and then was forced to rapidly apologise).</p> \n  <p>I\u2019m going to run Wilson\u2019s quote in full so readers can make up their own minds. He was speaking on ABC TV with WA Labor member <strong>Josh Wilson</strong> (the member for Fremantle, no relation (<em>at least I don\u2019t think so!</em>) about different states easing restrictions at different times.</p> \n  <p><strong>Tim Wilson</strong>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m a federalist and I believe that we should have local laws reflecting local conditions. But the other reason is because it puts the burden and responsibility on the states to actually explain why they\u2019ve taken the different approaches. Now, they\u2019re taking the point that Josh [Wilson] has just raised \u2013 you know, WA has done things differently. They let kids go back to school earlier, whereas Victoria is saying no. The burden and the responsibility then has to be on Dan Andrews, when other states are allowing people to go and visit their mums on Mother\u2019s Day, why can\u2019t we go and visit in Victoria, our mums on Mother\u2019s Day? Why can\u2019t we send our kids to school? Why are businesses being unnecessarily punished longer than in other states? And he has to come out and articulate that case and take responsibility for it.</p> \n   <p>I\u2019ve just outlined some serious questions I think that Dan Andrews needs to answer for Victorians, if he wants to maintain public confidence. <strong>Because I think ... and there is actually now a narrative that\u2019s building in parts of Victoria where people are increasingly concerned that he\u2019s probably enjoying the </strong><strong>clampdown too much in terms of the authority and power it\u2019s given him</strong>, <strong>and he\u2019s not as enthusiastic to roll it back.</strong> </p> \n   <p>So, people will have their own opinions.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Wilson later went on to say he was reflecting the sentiments expressed on the front page of the <strong>Herald Sun</strong> as evidence of the \u201cnarrative\u201d he was referring to.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I made the observation of what\u2019s in the Victorian press, and you need to actually go and read the Victorian press. I understand in WA that may not be the case, but the front page of the Herald Sun today is very clear, wanting to understand the rationale, the reasoning, behind why Dan Andrews is not reopening Victoria as other states are doing.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But there are three words at the beginning of that key sentence: \u201c<strong>Because I think.</strong>\u201d</p> \n  <p>Victoria has the second-highest total of Covid-19 cases in the country (1,468) behind only NSW.</p> \n  <p>Andrews said on Thursday:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Nobody is enjoying these settings, I understand that, but it is ... important to stay the course on this, not just to do what we want to do, but to do what is ... in the interests of every single Victorian family, every single Victorian business.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And yesterday: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can tell you what I will be doing on Mother\u2019s Day, I will not be visiting my mum. She is in good health, but has underlying health issues. I just wouldn\u2019t do it. I would very much like to.</p> \n   <p>These are unprecedented times. We are all doing things very differently.

  "<p>When Kate Milman was 21, she paused her English degree at the University of East Anglia to join <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/jan/23/the-newbury-bypass-protest-of-1996-in-pictures\" title=\"\">protests against the Newbury bypass</a>. It was 1996, and the road was being carved out through idyllic wooded countryside in Berkshire. She took up residence in a treehouse, in the path of the bulldozers, and lived there for months. It was a revelation. She lived intimately with the catkins, the calling birds, the slow-slow-fast change in the seasons. Despite being in a precarious position as a protester, she felt completely safe and her brain was calmed.</p> <p>\u201cYou know when you go camping and go back to your house, and everything feels wrong? The lighting is harsh and everything seems complicated indoors. It just got under my skin, this feeling \u2013 that [living in the woods] is like being at home.\u201d</p> <p>Finally, however, she was evicted from her forest heartland. The men and their machines arrived beneath her tree. Kate was arrested under a newly created \u201caggravated trespass\u201d law and barred from joining the protests again. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/24/newbury-protest-camp-bypass-legacy\" title=\"\">The wood was ripped apart</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThat level of grief \u2013 it felt like losing somebody,\u201d Kate says now. It was a highly complex woodland and she had come to know it intimately. \u201cI knew how beautiful it was at dawn and at full moon, and then it was bulldozed. When you watch that amount of stupidity, when you have that much grief and impotence, what can you do with it?\u201d</p> <p>The idea for <a href=\"https://wildthings.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Wild Things</a>, a workers\u2019 cooperative set up to provide children with experience of the natural world, was born. For three days each week, she and her fellow co-op members, Kath, Kat and Nick (her partner), provide half-day sessions for groups of nine pupils from various city schools.</p> <p>I\u2019ve come to a Wild Things day at Bestwood Country Park, a hilltop woodland on the edge of Nottingham. The wind runs through the canopy in waves, worrying the leaves, but it is calm and snug in the green, brambly understorey. The slender trunks of silver birches shine in the low sunlight.</p> <p>We are both layered in the warm, shapeless garb of the forest school practitioner. From the moment formal, government-provided schooling began in the Victorian era, dissenters have championed alternative forms of education based outdoors, which have placed the health and creativity of the child at their heart. \u201cForest school\u201d, a specific type of outdoor schooling with an emphasis on imaginative play in a forest setting and a fire circle, developed in Britain in the 1990s after teachers visited outdoor schools in Denmark. It has flourished in the last two decades without state support, as parents react against the rigid, test-based learning imposed by government reforms and the national curriculum.</p> <p>When I talk to people about forest schooling, everyone agrees that it\u2019s very important to help children \u201cconnect\u201d with the natural world. But, they often say, it\u2019s terribly middle class and white, isn\u2019t it?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b587ac9ab82d28dca697545d834ee841f55cbae4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b587ac9ab82d28dca697545d834ee841f55cbae4/0_0_2947_2947/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children's hands holding jay feathers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jay feathers discovered in the woods.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wild Things</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The children we\u2019re with today are mostly 10-year-olds, members of an \u201cEnglish as a second language\u201d group from Forest Fields primary and nursery school. The school\u2019s bucolic name belies its location in central Nottingham. Its 620 children speak 52 languages. Everyone in today\u2019s group arrived in Britain in the last two years. Several started school only two months ago. They are from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Romania and Syria, and some came from refugee camps. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what they\u2019ve seen,\u201d says their teaching assistant, Yasmin Khaliq, who speaks five languages. She has been bringing groups to Wild Things for nine years. \u201cIt\u2019s a godsend,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s all outdoors, they are seeing things with their own eyes, there\u2019s no language barrier.\u201d</p> <p>From somewhere above us comes the anxious \u201ccheeeept-cheeept\u201d of a great spotted woodpecker. Then another call, carried on the wind. \u201cKooooo-eeeeeeeeee!\u201d</p> <p>Kate replies, with a completely unexpected volume: \u201cKooooo-eeeeeeeeee!\u201d</p> <p>The children have been allowed to run ahead, alone, through the woods, and they follow the sound of Kate\u2019s call. I hear the heaving of a small pair of lungs before I see the boy, Mohammad, a slim child bent double with effort, legs flying out sideways like a skittish calf, eager to win his personal race. Next up the hill is a tiny, beaming Syrian girl. \u201cI\u2019m Amira, but you can call me Lion,\u201d she grins.</p> <p>All nine children are effervescent. I can\u2019t banish the image of a group of puppies, bouncing around outdoors for the first time. Kate and I walk to the Wild Things base camp. The children scamper ahead, shimmying around brambles, poking around the site with the sharp-eyed curiosity of chickens, investigating branches, tree stumps and some interesting-looking clippers laid out on a tarpaulin.</p> <p>On the days Kate doesn\u2019t take children on camps, she \u201cscrats around\u201d for charitable funding because, mostly, the only way to get pupils from cash-strapped state schools into the woods is to offer the sessions free. The Wild Things staff survive on a minuscule co-op \u201cshare\u201d wage. Kate lives with Nick and their eight-year-old son in a small rural housing co-op. They drive a battered high-top Transit stuffed with bow saws, loppers, clippers, ropes, tarpaulins, plastic mugs, hot chocolate and other essentials such as children\u2019s wellies and woollen gloves: the pupils rarely bring clothes suitable for outdoors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"17a0ce9c99f9b6bc326f7d48b37bb305d5138d8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17a0ce9c99f9b6bc326f7d48b37bb305d5138d8d/0_206_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A boy running on a path through the wood in Bestwood Country Park, Nottingham that the Wild Things Forest School uses as its classroom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Children need to feel liberated and free.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The children sit round the fire circle while Kate, Kath and Kat (\u201cthe three Ks\u201d) show them how to use loppers and saws, and explain today\u2019s activities. The pupils choose their own adventure. This child-led approach is intended to offer an alternative to conventional didactic, adult-led education, which misses \u201cthat whole chunk of experience where children are just getting to be a wild animal\u201d, Kate says. Ten-year-olds \u201care at that stage of development where they need to feel liberated and free\u201d.</p> <p>Today the children can learn to use bows and arrows, build a fire and cook on it, or lay a trail, hide and have another group track them down. The activities, says Kate when we break for lunch, are really giving them an excuse to mooch and dream in the forest. No two children respond to the place in the same way. Kate and her colleagues are constantly surprised by the infinite span of children\u2019s creative thought and their willingness to express it in the woods: one boy decides to build a gym, another a mask; a girl spins stories \u2013 about a frog and a turtle crossing her path.</p> <p>I join Kat and a trio of girls \u2013 keen little Amira; Homa, a Pakistani girl; and Cristina, a Roma Gypsy from Romania with a long plait, who wears a purple jumpsuit and a shiny purple padded jacket. She can\u2019t speak much English but understands plenty.</p> <p>Our mission is to lay a trail of arrows made from sticks through the wood to a spot where we will hide from the other members of the group.</p> <p>\u201cLike da?\u201d says Cristina, fashioning an arrow from three large branches.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Children can feel at home in the woods in a way they find more difficult in the community they have landed in</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cMake it smaller?\u201d suggests Kat.</p> <p>\u201cNo. Big!\u201d says Cristina.</p> <p>Cristina gasps as we twist along a narrow path, passing a tree stump covered in gleaming bracket fungus. Beech leaves shine luminous orange on the forest floor. \u201cCome on, guys!\u201d says Cristina. Last week she didn\u2019t talk at all, says Kat.</p> <p>I struggle to break a large stick into arrow pieces. Homa laughs: \u201cCristina is stronger than you,\u201d she says.</p> <p>I assumed that most refugees have come to the UK from cities, but Wild Things has worked with many migrant children who grew up in rural areas. Meanwhile British-born city children belong to a country called Indoors: they ask Kate, \u201cWhat\u2019s mud?\u201d or, \u201cWhy are there so many trees here?\u201d It is often only in Britain that rural children from overseas are confined to city-centre flats. Their questions \u2013 \u201cAre there elephants?\u201d or, \u201cAre there deadly snakes here?\u201d \u2013 are rooted in experience of their countries of origin. For many, Kate says, the woods awaken lost memories and a yearning for home. \u201cAs soon as we light a fire, they say, \u2018Ah, I know this\u2019 or they point to a plant and get really animated. They are in their element.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b58c5d380f381eca58dccf211c6c93fa88687d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b58c5d380f381eca58dccf211c6c93fa88687d4/0_120_4032_2904/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children setting off on a tracking hunt at a Wild Things forest school\" width=\"1000\" height=\"720\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Setting off on a tracking hunt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wild Things</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One group last spring included a partially sighted girl. \u201cWalking up into the woods, she stopped and said, \u2018Listen to that sound!\u2019\u201d remembers Kate. \u201cIt was the buzzing of the insects.\u201d It reminded the girl of her former country. At the end of her six weeks, she said, \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve come home.\u201d The Wild Things staff frequently hear similar declarations. \u201cOften children can feel at home in the woods in a way they find more difficult in the community they have landed in, where technology is everything, money is everything, they are at the bottom of the pecking order and there are massive tensions in the area. In the woods they are on a level playing field. They can just be kids again.\u201d</p> <p>We return to the fire circle and the children discuss their plans for next week.</p> <p>\u201cMake a wood house,\u201d says Sanaya. \u201cI made a house with sticks in Pakistan. My grandma makes a fire like this.\u201d</p> <p>It reminds her of home? \u201cYes.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We help a child to fall in love with nature and we don\u2019t know if they will ever be able to access it again</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What is the best thing about the wood? \u201cEverything,\u201d says Homa. \u201cHide-and-seek, the fire, the bread, because that makes us all hot.\u201d</p> <p>This prompts Adnan to reminisce about Syria. \u201cI used to like playing with my cousins. It was just like this but with less trees.\u201d</p> <p>Cristina is the most reluctant to leave.</p> <p>\u201cNext time, again?\u201d she asks Kate, looking worried. Kate counts on her fingers to show Cristina seven days.</p> <p>Cristina\u2019s face lengthens at the prospect of such a long wait, but she joins the rest of the group hurtling back down the hill to their minibus heading for the city, and their new homes.</p> <p>Kate and her fellow Wild Things workers often feel the weight of the children\u2019s longing to stay in the woods. \u201cThey constantly say things like, \u2018I feel so free out here,\u2019\u201d she says. Already today, on her second of six sessions, Sanaya was saying, \u201cI know I won\u2019t come back because my family haven\u2019t got a car.\u201d After the six weeks, Wild Things give every child a leaflet with bus routes, showing how they can reach the forest from Nottingham. But the bus drops them in the nearest village, and there\u2019s no cafe in the woods. It will be a very strong-willed 10-year-old who makes her own way here, and an act of faith for her parents to follow her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ac7478e7897d2a8317a3c7ccc476246c95b971f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ac7478e7897d2a8317a3c7ccc476246c95b971f/0_37_4032_2599/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children share treasures back at camp at a Wild Things forest school\" width=\"1000\" height=\"645\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sharing treasures back at camp.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wild Things</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wild Things know their work enhances the children\u2019s lives but, as Kate points out, \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to measure improvements in confidence, self-esteem, friendships, behaviour. Sometimes you do see something tangible, other times you don\u2019t. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s not happening.\u201d</p> <p>Forest school is still relatively new, educational research is poorly funded and a child\u2019s achievement is shaped by myriad circumstances that make it difficult for academics to control for every confounding factor. But there is an enormous weight of scientific research demonstrating the benefits of wild green space for adult mental and physical wellbeing, and a growing body of evidence pointing to the specific benefits of outdoor schooling.</p> <p>The physical gains are easiest to measure. In one study, <a href=\"https://www.owlscotland.org/images/uploads/resources/files/Physical_Activity_at_Forest_School_Research.pdf\" title=\"\">a group of Scottish nine-</a><a href=\"https://www.owlscotland.org/images/uploads/resources/files/Physical_Activity_at_Forest_School_Research.pdf\" title=\"\">11-year-olds were fitted with accelerometers</a> to measure their physical activity during a typical school day and during a day at forest school. These revealed that activity levels were 2.2 times greater during forest school days than on normal school days that included PE lessons, and 2.7 times greater than on \u201cinactive\u201d school days. Scandinavian studies of outdoor schools have also found they improve children\u2019s attentiveness. In 2017, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494417300737\" title=\"\">a four-year study from Norway</a> identified more inattention and hyperactivity symptoms the less time children spent at an outdoor preschool.</p> <p>Perhaps most surprisingly, there is also hard evidence that outdoor schooling can produce better academic outcomes. A <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03004430.2018.1446430\" title=\"\">three-year study of primary school pupils</a> who were \u201cstruggling to thrive\u201d found a group who attended weekly forest school sessions achieved better overall attendance than their primary school-only peers, and markedly better attainment. The forest school pupils\u2019 writing improved by 18% compared with 7% among comparably disadvantaged pupils; reading improved by 27%, compared with 22% among school-only children; and maths attainment rose by 27% compared with 11%.</p> <p>Even so, forest school teachers are acutely aware that they offer only a tiny taste of magic in childhoods where more time is spent indoors than in any preceding generation. \u201cWe help a child to fall in love with nature and we don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll ever be able to access it again,\u201d Kate says. She thinks for a moment. At least the children now know the woods are there. The place may call to them at any point in the future. \u201cIt\u2019s better to know there\u2019s a bit missing.

In an affectingly claustrophobic second-person address, the immigrant speaker talks to her white, middle-class, liberal host. Despite the host\u2019s \u201ccontra-regime\u201d politics and assurances that \u201cWhat\u2019s mine is yours\u201d, the power dynamic is steeped in inequality; everything is done on the host\u2019s terms, and \u201cthere\u2019s no law / That requires / What you\u2019re offering me to last\u201d. In this house \u2013 or in the nation state in which the immigrant is forced into the role of constant guest \u2013 the speaker is subtly undermined, turned into a \u201cpet\u201d and her rights amended accordingly. The host interrupts the speaker, polices her interactions, finds and reads aloud her diary. Hospitality is conditional: the performance of generosity is hollow. In this series of precise, destabilising poems, Kapil skilfully amplifies the pressured immigrant heart, showing how precarious it is to exist in colour in a white space.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a652f0298c9b427e4788b964c821666a0878ebe4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a652f0298c9b427e4788b964c821666a0878ebe4/0_0_189_293/189.jpg\" alt=\"Saffron Jack by Rishi Dastidar \" width=\"189\" height=\"293\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The ways in which immigrant voices are failed by the state are also examined in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/gallery/2008/oct/13/memoir-on-a-postcard\">Rishi Dastidar</a>\u2019s second collection, <strong>Saffron Jack</strong><em> </em>(Nine Arches, \u00a39.99), a long narrative poem that revises the fervent imperialist Rudyard Kipling\u2019s story <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/oct/12/featuresreviews.guardianreview1\">\u201cThe Man Who Would Be King\u201d</a>, from <em>Plain Tales From the Hills</em>.

  "<p>With gyms and leisure centres closed, many people have turned to running. You can literally just step out of your door and begin your government-approved exercise but, if you want to make the most of it and improve your health and fitness, a few small things can go a long way.</p> <h2><strong>The basics</strong></h2> <p><strong>Shoes</strong></p> <p>A good pair of running shoes is essential to help keep your feet in healthy shape.</p> <p>Most will need regular road shoes, with proper cushioning for pavement and Tarmac, unless you\u2019re running trails.</p> <p>Everyone\u2019s feet are different so specialist shops offer gait analysis for free.

Stability or motion control shoes can help those who overpronate, while neutral shoes are normally recommended for everyone else.</p> <p>Shoes need enough room in the front so you can freely wiggle your toes, and to be well fitting along the whole of your foot. Different brands have different fits, too, with some being wider in the toe or shallower in depth, while each manufacturer will have a range of models differing in weight, cushioning and support.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e34d9aa7c4b3c8672b7f90c13d729f83f802470\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e34d9aa7c4b3c8672b7f90c13d729f83f802470/0_0_5079_3048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A close, low angle view of a male athlete running along a tarmac road\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The right shoes, such as these from Asics, can help protect you from the impact of running on hard surfaces.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordan Weeks/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All the big brands sell running shoes, but there are also many specialist makes.

  "<p>Airbnb has revolutionised travel and since it was founded in 2008 hundreds of thousands of property owners have used the holiday accommodation platform to make ends meet, make a living and, in some cases, make a killing.</p> <p>But while hosts, as they are known, are wringing their hands over the collapse of the travel industry and their loss of income, many city authorities are rubbing theirs at the prospect of thousands of holiday lets returning to the traditional rental market. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/20/soaring-rents-and-noisy-parties-how-airbnb-is-forcing-out-barcelona-locals\">Cities complain</a> that the highly profitable holiday lets have driven up rents and forced out residents with the knock-on effect that local businesses no longer have a community to serve.</p> <p>\u201cWe hope to see a third or even a half of these licensed tourist apartments become normal apartments to rent over the next three years,\u201d said Janet Sanz, Barcelona\u2019s deputy mayor.</p> <p>This was echoed by Ian Brossat, the Paris deputy mayor in charge of housing. \u201cWe intend to take the opportunity to regain control,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Brossat said Airbnb listings had \u201ccollapsed\u201d in Paris and hosts had registered just 40 stays with authorities in the first three weeks of April, compared to an average of 1,210 a month last year. Airbnb refutes the figures, preferring to focus on supply rather than demand.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a report by the holiday rental analysts <a href=\"https://www.seetransparent.com/coronavirus-impact/impact-in-global-demand.html\">Transparent</a> shows a drop of about 98% in reservations in Spain since the lockdown began on 14 March. No one expects a quick recovery and in Spain the tourism industry has effectively written off 2020 and is looking ahead to next year.</p> <p>In order to recoup their losses, owners are now turning to the conventional rental market, with hundreds, possibly thousands, of apartments being offered in Spanish cities for short lets of up to a year, clearly with an eye to a recovery in 2021.</p> <p>However, short lets are only legal for people who have to move temporarily to the city for work. As no one is allowed to move anywhere at present such rentals are likely to be illegal and Sanz says efforts will be made to prosecute.</p> <p>Barcelona has had a long-running war with Airbnb. There are 9,600 licensed holiday apartments in the city and at least that many are unlicensed, contributing to an explosion of tourism to the city since the platform started offering listings in 2009. The platform is also blamed for driving up rents in the city.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the owners of tourist apartments want now is stability, and they can get that from conventional lettings,\u201d Sanz believes. \u201cOf course they\u2019ll make less than they would renting to tourists.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"936a1093fb34d6388297e1bd4fff3ebe95d8fd95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/936a1093fb34d6388297e1bd4fff3ebe95d8fd95/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An aerial view of central Paris during lockdown\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paris city hall estimates Airbnb deprives residents of about 30,000 homes used exclusively for short-term tourist lets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacques Witt/Sipa/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paris city hall, also a longstanding opponent of Airbnb\u2019s relentless expansion, estimates the platform deprives the city\u2019s residents of about 30,000 homes used exclusively for short-term tourist lets, including up to 25% of apartments in the four central arrondissements.</p> <p>Brossat <a href=\"https://www.lejdd.fr/JDD-Paris/avec-la-crise-paris-veut-reprendre-le-controle-face-a-airbnb-3966018\">told Le Journal du Dimanche</a> that authorities were concerned some cash-strapped hosts were renting their apartments for prostitution or other illicit activities, while others were illegally using a new type of medium-term rental contract lasting from one to nine months and reserved for students and employees on secondment or attending training courses.</p> <p>\u201cThe city could buy up some of these apartments and return them to the traditional rental market,\u201d Brossat said. \u201cSeveral hundred apartments in central Paris could be involved.\u201d</p> <p>A similar pattern has emerged in Dublin, where there are an <a href=\"http://insideairbnb.com/dublin/?neighbourhood=&amp;filterEntireHomes=false&amp;filterHighlyAvailable=false&amp;filterRecentReviews=false&amp;filterMultiListings=false\">estimated 9,400 Airbnb</a> apartments.

Around this time of year we usually help with the transition from year six to year seven but because of the lockdown that couldn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/08/kyle-walker-hits-back-at-harrassment-after-breaching-covid-19-lockdown\">Kyle Walker hits back at 'harassment' after breaching Covid-19 lockdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With half of Palace for Life\u2019s staff furloughed and only children of key workers attending school, Henry and his mentors quickly realised they needed to find a new way of staying connected.</p> <p>\u201cFor the first couple of weeks we were just checking in with our young people and most of them said they were spending most of the time on their Xbox or PlayStation,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was when we thought: \u2018I wonder if that can help us continue our work?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The foundation has since provided consoles to a number of local families thanks to a partnership with the gaming retailer Go2Games, enabling the mentors to communicate with their young people on a daily basis via the consoles\u2019 chat facility.</p> <p>\u201cThey are learning very quickly if they don\u2019t know already how to play Fifa or Fortnite,\u201d says Mike Summers, the Palace for Life Foundation\u2019s chief executive. \u201cIn a normal situation we are encouraging young people to get out and be active but most of the activities aren\u2019t possible. It\u2019s early days but we have had some very promising signs about how young people are responding.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36711c80f6afc3196ea65232cf8a34e6762a3d6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36711c80f6afc3196ea65232cf8a34e6762a3d6a/0_371_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Crystal Palace foundation at work before the coronavirus pandemic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Crystal Palace foundation at work before the coronavirus pandemic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: palaceforlife.org</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Almost six weeks after lockdown measures were implemented, however, Henry admits some have taken matters into their own hands. He says one child, who had recently moved to a school in a different borough because he was getting into trouble, ran away from home for a few days.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a lot more cases of kids feeling anxiety,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s our job to offer some support in terms of their mental health. But there are a few who are seeing this as an opportunity because they have previously been involved in crime. They think that no one is watching what they are doing and there is no one to stop them going wherever they want in half the time it usually takes.</p> <p>\u201cWe have reminded them about the consequences of their actions: just because you got away with it once that doesn\u2019t mean you will next time. We\u2019ve had a few cases of people saying they are going out to meet their friends but this gives us another chance to emphasise the government\u2019s message that they are putting their own families at risk.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to encourage them to use this time wisely by learning a new skill or finding online courses they might have an interest in. Now at least they have the luxury of time.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A small number of coaches are still delivering sessions in schools \u2013 with physical-distancing rules in force \u2013 and the foundation is providing an online healthy eating course for the children to follow.</p> <p>\u201cOur business model changed overnight,\u201d Summers says. \u201cWe are usually out in the community delivering football to children and all of a sudden we couldn\u2019t do most of that. But we still have coaches delivering modified activities in six schools and we are very proud of all of how brave they are all being.</p> <p>\u201cYoung people and particularly those from a more deprived background are really going to struggle as these weeks go on. Often they are in crammed accommodation with no garden, potentially living in environments where everyone is not getting on harmoniously.</p> <p>\u201cIf this goes on for a lot longer then tensions are going to build as young people are missing out on their opportunity to play football or see their friends. There\u2019s a melting pot of problems that could blow up so hopefully programmes like ours can help.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Charlie is working on two things in lockdown. First, his studies: at 13, he\u2019s the first to admit his focus is patchy. \u201cI don\u2019t do a lot of homework,\u201d he says. \u201cMy mum complains about that all the time.\u201d That isn\u2019t to say he hasn\u2019t thought about a career. \u201cI wanted to be a game designer, but now I think the future\u2019s in diseases, in microbiology, so I am also interested in that. A bit.\u201d</p> <p>His other work requires hours of dedication and is something Charlie has genuine enthusiasm for: working on his body. His daily routine starts with 40 press-ups while his shower is running. He eats five eggs and four pieces of toast for breakfast. His ideal lunch would be grilled fish and rice, but when he is at school he typically has to eat pasta with tuna sauce, since the canteen\u2019s focus is feeding children, not lean body sculpting. \u201cHe won\u2019t eat sausages or any processed stuff,\u201d says his mother, Helen. She is married and lives in Liverpool with the couple\u2019s three children, aged five to 13.</p> <p>Charlie snacks on bananas, strawberries, protein yoghurts and expensive juices with ingredients such as broccoli and barley grass. He hasn\u2019t eaten refined sugar since 2017. \u201cI started to get acne and cut down,\u201d he explains.</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d his mother says. \u201cHe was the Nutella king. Now he\u2019d be gobsmacked if I served him chocolate.\u201d He drinks lots of water.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you\u2019ve got a child who is overweight, you worry. I\u2019ve got one who is extremely muscular and lean, and I still worry</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At 5pm, it\u2019s time for Charlie\u2019s workout, a ritualised activity he does in his bedroom. He wouldn\u2019t be allowed in a gym \u2013 the minimum age in most is 16 \u2013 but he doesn\u2019t really like the idea anyway, mainly because he wouldn\u2019t know what to do with the equipment. </p> <p>Instead he has developed his own programme: a rapid-fire routine of push-ups (55 x 3); curls (65 in five minutes); planks (hold for four minutes x 3); biceps curls with dumbbells (150 each side). His exercises are directed at the parts of his body he most wants to transform: his arms and chest. \u201cI don\u2019t really work on my legs, because no one sees them. I don\u2019t wear shorts much.\u201d He prefers a pair of joggers and a sleeveless top to emphasise his biceps and shoulders.</p> <p>He works until his muscles can\u2019t take any more. \u201cI push myself until I can barely breathe and I\u2019ve got a headache. Then I go downstairs to have some food, and then go back up again.\u201d After he\u2019s finished, Charlie warms down with five minutes of leg raises, then has dinner: four salmon fillets and rice. \u201cI am probably spending an extra \u00a340 a week on him,\u201d Helen says. \u201cI also spend loads on skincare products. Charlie will say, \u2018I need charcoal soap \u2013 everyone says it\u2019s good for your skin.\u2019 Or, \u2018I need ginger shampoo because it\u2019s good for dandruff.\u2019\u201d The recommendations come through Instagram, she says. \u201cWhen I was 13, my mum just put a bar of soap in the bathroom and that was it.\u201d</p> <p>Is she spending more than she should? \u201cYes, it\u2019s expensive, but everything healthy costs more,\u201d Helen says. \u201cMy husband says there are worse things he could be doing. Muscles, training and fitness \u2013 it\u2019s not the worst vice to have.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68734d749a540f8457ea9634404bdd714ea9297b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68734d749a540f8457ea9634404bdd714ea9297b/0_2329_3839_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The top of a young boy's head and his arms holding a bar with heavy weights on\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I wouldn\u2019t say I was being bullied, but I was being pushed around by a load of kids, because I was really skinny.\u2019 Photograph: Kellie French/The Guardian.

But as a mum you always worry. If you\u2019ve got a child who is overweight and eating loads of chocolate, you worry. I\u2019ve got one who is extremely muscular and lean, and I am still worried. God forbid he gets into steroids. At the moment his body is a temple. He won\u2019t vape. He won\u2019t smoke. He doesn\u2019t want to damage anything.\u201d</p> <p>Charlie was quite shy as a little boy, according to his mother, and had a slight stutter. Things came to a head when he was nine. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I was being bullied, but I was being pushed around by a load of kids, because I was really skinny,\u201d Charlie says. His mother enrolled him in boxing classes, twice a week, after being told \u201cboxing is very good if you get bullied. It channels your energy and controls your emotions.\u201d He did karate twice a week.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There have been studies that show boys internalise a desire to be muscular as young as six years old</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And as he got stronger, he felt better. \u201cIt made me feel I can handle myself,\u201d Charlie says. He no longer gets pushed around by older boys. The way he sees it, working on his body is paying off. \u201cYes, I would say I\u2019m popular,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s started a big trend in his year group,\u201d his mother adds. \u201cThe boys want to be fit because he gets a lot of attention from being like this \u2013 from girls.\u201d He also gets approval on social media, something that motivates many teenagers. \u201cYou have to look good on camera, or people are going to judge you,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s massively different to when I was young,\u201d Helen says. \u201cWe might not have seen our friends after school. You wouldn\u2019t have to look good all the time, whereas they are socialising 24/7, on their phones, Instagram and Snapchat, sending photos. They\u2019ll be posing in front of the mirror. They\u2019re still arguing, fighting, flirting, whatever. We went home and you wouldn\u2019t speak to anybody.\u201d</p> <p>Is there anything you would like to change about your body, I ask Charlie. \u201cI\u2019d like to wax my back,\u201d he replies. He\u2019d also like bigger muscles. \u201cSchool is probably cancelled until September, so I\u2019ve got a load of time to work on that.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>\u201cThe pressure on young men, and boys, to become more muscular has grown,\u201d says Jason Nagata, assistant professor of paediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco, and an expert in body image and eating disorders. In a 2018 study of more than 15,000 US high school students published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, nearly one third of teenage boys aged 13-18 reported <a href=\"https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(18)30417-8/fulltext\" title=\"\">trying to gain weight or bulk up</a>. This ambition affects even small children. \u201cThere have been studies that show boys internalise a desire to be muscular as <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1740144518300640?via%3Dihub\" title=\"\">young as six</a>,\u201d Nagata says.</p> <p>This messaging starts with toys. In 2006, sports scientists measured the necks, chests, arms, forearms, thighs and calves of five popular action figures, comparing them with the dimensions of their original designs. They found that Batman, Superman, the Incredible Hulk et al were <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1740144505001026\" title=\"\">significantly more muscular than their original counterparts</a>. </p> <p>The same thing has happened to Hollywood actors. <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/470068/daniel-craigs-james-bond-buff\" title=\"\">\u201cIs Daniel Craig\u2019s James Bond too buff?\u201d</a> asked one columnist in 2012. While Sean Connery\u2019s Bond was all savoir-faire and sophistication, Craig\u2019s put the emphasis on delts and pecs. The actor\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/daniel-craig-james-bond-no-time-to-die-cover-2020\" title=\"\">most recent photoshoot</a>, promoting the now-delayed No Time To Die on the cover of GQ, topless and with jeans unbuttoned, suggests the era of the body-shaming Bond is not over yet. (It was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/chris-hemsworth\" title=\"\">Chris Hemsworth</a>, the actor who plays Thor in the Marvel films, who first inspired Charlie to start working out.)</p> <p>It\u2019s now not just Premier League footballers who are ripped; it\u2019s their offspring, too. When David Beckham\u2019s middle son, Romeo, 17, posted a picture of himself working out <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/romeobeckham/\" title=\"\">on Instagram</a> last year, all abs and pecs, the photo got more than 185,000 likes<strong>.</strong> Meanwhile Cruz Beckham, 15, has <a href=\"https://www.hellomagazine.com/healthandbeauty/health-and-fitness/2018041147738/david-beckham-workout-son-cruz/\" title=\"\">joined his dad for gym sessions</a> and, recently, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwYqg2TlpWE\" title=\"\">a lockdown workout of 50 crunches</a>. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In lockdown, Joshua worries he is falling behind: he is lifting a rucksack full of school books</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI wonder how many young lads would be going to the gym if it wasn\u2019t for social media,\u201d says Terry Anderson, owner of CrossFit All Out, a gym in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham. A gym chain manager for 13 years, he opened his own gym in 2014 after spotting a growing demand for CrossFit \u2013 a fitness programme that combines weightlifting, running and gymnastics \u2013 especially from those too young to join regular gyms. He caters for children as young as three; the half-hour session includes squatting (to understand the correct position for when they come to lift a barbell) and swinging 2kg kettlebells. Anderson says he wants children to learn the joy of physical activity, which is one reason why his gym is mirror-free. \u201cI don\u2019t want kids stood posing in front of mirrors. If you go to normal gyms, it\u2019s lads looking in the mirror at their biceps when they\u2019re doing their curls, and taking selfies on the machines.\u201d</p> <p>Is three too young to be lifting weights? Anderson argues that the children are \u201cexcited\u201d to use the little kettlebells, and that 2kg is not a harmful weight. \u201cWe often have a superhero theme,\u201d says Vikki, Terry\u2019s wife. \u201cIt\u2019s low-key, very basic, just giving them a little taste. The actual workout is maybe 10 minutes.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, getting fit can be a good thing when so many children are overweight (<a href=\"https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/key-topics/nutrition-obesity/about-childhood-obesity\" title=\"\">almost one in five when they start primary school</a>). But experts worry when the ideal becomes a tyranny. \u201cThere is a fine line,\u201d Nagata says. \u201cSome young men become obsessed with their appearance and engage in excessive or compulsive exercise, and body image takes over their lives.\u201d</p> <p>How did body sculpting go from a niche hobby, practised by bodybuilders in underground gyms, to a physical goal for many young men around the world? And just how worrying is today\u2019s pressure on young boys to get ripped?</p> <p>***</p> <p>In the 60s and 70s, we had the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/davidbowie\" title=\"\">David Bowie</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/mick-jagger\" title=\"\">Mick Jagger</a>, who reinforced the desirability of a specific type of body: thin, elegant, suggestive of a drug habit. In the 80s, there was a shift; we had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/arnold-schwarzenegger\" title=\"\">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> in Conan The Barbarian, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/sylvester-stallone\" title=\"\">Sylvester Stallone</a> in Rambo. The world of advertising was waking up to the marketability of men\u2019s bodies, too. \u201cAdvertisements were no longer just the kind of Marlboro Man cowboy, clothed from head to toe. We started to see shirtless ads,\u201d says Roberto Olivardia, clinical psychologist and lecturer in the department of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, and co-author of <a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Adonis-Complex/Harrison-G-Pope/9780684869117\" title=\"\">The Adonis Complex</a>. Where advertising had long preyed on the insecurities of women, it was, Olivardia says, the turn of men.</p> <p>The turn of the century marked another shift. David Fincher\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/15/fight-club-at-20-the-prescience-and-power-of-david-finchers-drama\" title=\"\">Fight Club</a> was released in 1999, and developed a cult following among men who wanted to replicate Brad Pitt\u2019s \u201clean and mean\u201d body: muscular but not bulky. The cult is still strong, and Pitt\u2019s Fight Club body remains a topic of conversation <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/uk/fitness/a758243/how-to-get-a-body-like-brad-pitt-in-fight-club/\" title=\"\">on bodybuilding and nutrition forums</a> 20 years after the film\u2019s release. It is a difficult look to achieve, a physique that requires a strict high protein diet and a lot of hard working out.</p> <p>In today\u2019s world of work, looking toned is seen as a career asset because of the discipline involved. A lean, fit boss is an indicator of a lean, fit business; both Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos and Apple\u2019s Tim Cook have <a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/health-fitness/worlds-powerful-ceos-getting-super-buff.html/\" title=\"\">made headlines for their \u201csuper buff</a><a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/health-fitness/worlds-powerful-ceos-getting-super-buff.html/\" title=\"\">\u201d bodies</a>. \u201cI work with a lot of men who feel this pressure to go to the gym \u2013 not to be healthy but to achieve this body image that says, \u2018I am in control,\u2019\u201d Olivardia says. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb3952c5c68aa971b1031ae23a1b92ce5f380867\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb3952c5c68aa971b1031ae23a1b92ce5f380867/61_3_4627_2780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A boy in school uniform standing behind a bar with heavy weights on\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018After I joined the gym, I was so sore the next day, I couldn\u2019t put my school shirt on without Mum\u2019s help.\u2019 Photograph: Kellie French/The Guardian.

William is 15 and lives in Newcastle with his brother, Liam, 16, and his mother, who runs a business. Most days, William wakes at 6am, runs to the park, where he does pull-ups and dips in the workout zone. About 40 minutes later, he\u2019ll run home and get ready for school. After school, he does his homework and then spends an hour working out in the garage, where there is an exercise bike, rowing machine and punchbag.</p> <p>About three times a week, he\u2019ll do a routine of push-ups, sit-ups and maybe some chest-openers. He works out in his bedroom, where the decor includes a poster of Captain America, a duvet patterned with Marvel comics and a book he got for Christmas, Men\u2019s Health Best: Weight-Free Workout. He has an Apple Watch fitness tracker to record his progress.</p> <p>William started on his regime when he was 13. \u201cI gave up my iPad for Lent and had loads of free time. I just wanted to get stronger because it\u2019s good for you,\u201d he explains. He\u2019s grown up in a household that values fitness: his mother runs, and his grandfather was a bodybuilder.</p> <p>William\u2019s mother describes her son as self-disciplined and persistent, someone who likes targets. His friends are into comedy shows, not fitness, but he is a convert because of its psychological benefits. \u201cI am definitely more focused. If I didn\u2019t do any exercise for the whole day, I\u2019d have excess energy and wouldn\u2019t be able to concentrate.\u201d That\u2019s not to say he doesn\u2019t also take pleasure in the physical results. \u201cMy legs and chest are definitely more defined than they used to be,\u201d he says. His mother adds that he has \u201ca beautiful, flat tummy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cGirls naturally mature into their bodies \u2013 they get their boobs and waist and everything \u2013 but boys don\u2019t naturally grow muscles,\u201d she continues. \u201cTo get the muscle definition they\u2019ve got on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/love-island\" title=\"\">Love Island</a> is unattainable, unless you\u2019re eating a really strict diet. But that\u2019s what society has moved towards. What boys see online is what they think they should look like.\u201d The UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/good-childhood-report\" title=\"\">2019 Good Childhood Report</a>, a survey of almost 2,400 children, echoed this, finding that one in 12 boys aged 10-15 were unhappy with their appearance, citing the \u201cripped\u201d male body types shown on Love Island as one factor.</p> <p>Jack, 16, who lives in London, is clear about why he goes to the gym. \u201cMuscles are attractive to girls,\u201d he says. \u201cPretty much anyone who is popular has muscles.\u201d He\u2019d been desperate to join his local gym since he was 14, but the rules said he had to wait until his 16th birthday. Pre-lockdown, he would typically go four times a week after school, with a group of seven friends, all boys. They work on a different part of their body each time \u2013 chest, arms, legs \u2013 hoping for a return on their \u00a323.99 a month investment.</p> <p>After the first visit, he was so sore, \u201cI couldn\u2019t put my shirt on for school the next day without my mum\u2019s help. My muscles had tensed up.\u201d He was just beginning to see the results, Jack says, when lockdown started. Now he does a few sit-ups and push-ups at home. \u201cMum has a resistance band and I\u2019ve been trying to use that, but it\u2019s a bit too small. So I feel I\u2019m going back to how I was before.\u201d</p> <p>Joshua, 18, was typically spending around 18 hours a week in the gym.

Screening is often based on the premise of thinness, and doesn\u2019t take the \u201cripped\u201d phenomenon \u2013 muscle dysmorphia or \u201cbigorexia\u201d \u2013 into account. \u201cWe don\u2019t ask about muscle-enhancing behaviours, so I think a lot of these [disorders] are missed.\u201d</p> <p>Professor David Veale, a London-based consultant psychiatrist in cognitive behaviour therapy, and an expert in body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), says it\u2019s not a problem BDD practitioners see a lot, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not there. \u201cIn general, it\u2019s below the radar. They don\u2019t tend to be so distressed that they are seeking mental health help. Many cope and get by.\u201d</p> <p>So nobody knows how many boys might have BDD?</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely. Mental health services are completely stretched anyway, and compared with other people with severe body image problems, they tend to get away with it. But I am sure they are building up problems for themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Kitty Wallace of the UK-based <a href=\"https://bddfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Body Dysmorphic Disorder Foundation</a> agrees. \u201cWhen boys start to show this behaviour, it can be responded to quite positively by people around them, and by social media. But they\u2019ll miss some of the more negative behaviour that goes with it, such as huge anxiety about body image. By the time it starts to affect a boy\u2019s day-to-day life, they are often older and don\u2019t necessarily have people around them who are able to say this isn\u2019t quite right. Then they find it harder to come forward and talk about their mental health.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e568d36f6d8f7446de2663f579a0770f146e6028\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e568d36f6d8f7446de2663f579a0770f146e6028/0_0_3110_2599/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A photograph of a boy in a school shirt and tie with protein bars in his pocket\" width=\"1000\" height=\"836\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One study found 22% of young men aged 18-24 had disordered eating due to a desire to enhance muscles.

What should make a parent worry? \u201cFirst, how accurate is the person\u2019s body image?\u201d says Olivardia, who treats boys with bigorexia. \u201cWhen they look in the mirror, are they able to see how they look, or is there a distortion? Are they always dissatisfied with the way they look?\u201d He also points to the amount of time a boy is spending on his body, \u201cand how much time it is taking away from other things that are important and fulfilling in life. He has to do well at school, has to be healthy and has to foster real relationships, not just online likes.\u201d</p> <p>The patients referred to him have a very narrow sense of identity, he says. \u201cIt is defined by their body image. I have some patients who are nearly suicidal because they can\u2019t work out, because they have sustained some kind of injury \u2013 often from overexercising. It shouldn\u2019t take on that much importance, that you feel life isn\u2019t worth living because you are going to lose some muscle mass.\u201d Olivardia treats these patients in a similar way to others with eating disorders and OCD: through a combination of education about nutrition and the dangers of overexercising, and cognitive behavioural therapy to address negative thinking patterns.</p> <p>***</p> <p>In Liverpool, I ask Charlie what teenage boys worry about most. He says his friend Nathan, who is football-obsessed, would be \u201cdistraught\u201d if he didn\u2019t make the school football team. \u201cOthers worry about, \u2018Oh no, will I lose this game on Call Of Duty?\u2019 I don\u2019t worry about that.\u201d He pauses. \u201cMum and Dad have no idea about this, but I mainly worry about my great-grandma. She\u2019s really old and we\u2019re really close. My biggest worry is losing her.\u201d</p> <p>When it comes to working out, it\u2019s the validation Charlie gets from social media that is the biggest draw. Olivardia says he sees this as one of the hardest habits to shake. \u201cAs the parent of a 15-year-old [boy] and a 13-year-old [girl], my goal is for neither of them to have social media until they\u2019re at college. I am generally very open-minded, and as a teen I would have absolutely loved social media. But I know it wouldn\u2019t have been good for me.\u201d</p> <p>How big a problem does he think bigorexia is becoming among young boys? Olivardia says it\u2019s important to keep it in perspective; there are other, worse health crises: \u201cWe have a very big problem with obesity in children and teenagers.\u201d Larger numbers of teens are playing video games and not exercising at all. Working out and getting fit, even at a young age, is fine, he says, up to a point. \u201cAs long as the conversation is always around health and the joy of physical activity \u2013 as opposed to just being strong for strong\u2019s sake, or looking good for looking good\u2019s sake.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Some names and identifying details have been changed.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 May 2020 to correct references to \u201cbicep\u201d to biceps.</p>",

The Last Dance, a 10-part film jointly produced with Netflix, promised an unvarnished deep dive into one of the most transformative stars and feted dynasties in the history of sports: Michael Jordan and the 1990s Chicago Bulls.</p> <p>The anticipation only mounted with the release of a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Peh9Yqf1GXc\">glossy extended trailer</a> at Christmas that teased never-before-seen footage and a star-studded roster of interviewees \u2013 Barack Obama! Justin Timberlake! \u2013 along with the participation of Jordan himself, who has spoken only sparingly about the Bulls\u2019 imperious reign and dumbfounding break-up in the two decades since his playing days. Initially slated for a June release alongside this year\u2019s NBA finals, ESPN swiftly moved up the premiere date to April after the coronavirus pandemic went scorched earth on its spring programming schedule.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/01/sixers-lakers-2001-nba-finals\">My favourite game: Iverson stuns Kobe's Lakers in the 2001 NBA finals | Bryan Armen Graham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As entertainment, it has delivered in almost every imaginable way. Buoyed by the narcotic allure of nostalgia, the slick blend of archival footage, present-day interviews and <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX45xYefy6tIi\">spare-no-expense soundtrack</a> breathes fresh life into even the most familiar plot points of Jordan\u2019s trajectory from precocious amateur to larger-than-life symbol both overexposed and mysterious. It is one of the few American sports yarns worthy of such a sprawling canvas and the episodes have become appointment television on Sunday nights throughout the past month, averaging a massive-for-today six million viewers over the first six installments ahead of their next-day release internationally on Netflix. Turns out even the opening notes of Sirius by the Alan Parsons Project, the instrumental backdrop for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn6kiimEsYc\">the Bulls\u2019 player introductions</a> and perhaps the closest US analogue to the All Blacks\u2019 haka for spine-tingling pregame stagecraft, are still enough to elicit chills after all these years.</p> <p>But as journalism, regrettably, The Last Dance borders on malpractice. What ESPN has declined to mention during its breathless promotional blitz is that Jordan\u2019s own production company, Jump 23, is among the co-producers behind the project \u2013 a fact you wouldn\u2019t know from the closing credits, from which it has been <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8420184/companycredits\">notably omitted</a>. Among the few to seize on this detail amid the film\u2019s deliriously enthusiastic public reception has been the venerable American documentarian Ken Burns, who described the arrangement as \u201cthe opposite direction of where we need to be going\u201d to the Wall Street Journal this week. \u201cIf you are there influencing the very fact of it getting made it means that certain aspects that you don\u2019t necessarily want in aren\u2019t going to be in, period,\u201d Burns said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not the way you do good journalism ... and it\u2019s certainly not the way you do good history, my business.\u201d</p> <p>ESPN\u2019s failure to disclose what amounts to Jordan\u2019s retaining final cut of its film might not stand out as an ethical sticking point had it been put forth as a point-of-view piece in the spirit of, say, 2002\u2019s The Kid Stays in the Picture, which leaves it to the viewer to parse the truth from Robert Evans\u2019 unreliable narrator. But The Last Dance has instead been presented as a definitive account, even as it is compromised by the defects and biases inherent in any authorized biography, with little regard for those cast as villains (even <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/society/michael-jordan-last-dance/\">if they\u2019re not alive to give their side</a>).</p> <p>Of course, concessions were necessary for the project to even get off the ground. The more than 500 hours of behind-the-scenes footage from Jordan\u2019s titular final season with the Bulls, which comprises the narrative spine of The Last Dance, has only seen the light of day because of a pact between the star and the NBA\u2019s in-house entertainment division: that any of it could only be used with his explicit consent. As commissioner Adam Silver <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29044827/an-all-access-michael-jordan-documentary-how-last-dance-was-made-possible\">recalled</a> to (who else?)

Jordan\u2019s near-psychopathic competitive streak, a sort of Daniel Plainview in high tops, has been exhaustively documented, but watching a 57-year-old man reflect on that image and <a href=\"https://streamable.com/uxvwy1\">weigh in on decades-old scores</a> is undeniably compelling theater. Still, allowing the subject to have final review and editorial control all but ensures the most ambitious promises of The Last Dance can never be fulfilled.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/04/michael-jordan-espn-last-dance-republicans-sneakers-quote-nba\">Michael Jordan insists 'Republicans buy sneakers too' quote was a joke</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What\u2019s been billed as a warts-and-all chronicle doesn\u2019t quite gloss over the less pleasant elements of Jordan\u2019s legacy, long the fodder of whisper networks and urban legend, but he addresses them entirely on his terms. Story arcs on his compulsive gambling habit and tyrannical proclivities with teammates can appear problematic at the outset, but come off looking forgivable in the end. For the first time Jordan opens up about his infamous \u201cRepublicans buy sneakers, too\u201d apoliticism \u2013 a trait which has not aged especially well amid the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/jan/14/donald-trump-inauguration-us-sports-activism\">post-Kaepernick resurgence of athlete activism</a> \u2013 yet the filmmakers apparently didn\u2019t think it was worth speaking with Craig Hodges, a key contributor on the first two of Jordan\u2019s six championship teams who has been among <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/apr/20/craig-hodges-michael-jordan-nba-chicago-bulls\">his most vocal critics on the subject</a> \u2013 a conspicuous omission given the more than 100 people in Jordan\u2019s orbit that were interviewed. We are left with the unshakeable sensation that we\u2019re not getting the straight dope, rather seeing Jordan as he wants to be seen.</p> <p>This is less than an indictment of the filmmakers and more a commentary of our media climate. As much as we\u2019d love to see this material in the hands of a Pennebaker or Burns or Asif Kapadia, that\u2019s simply a non-starter in an age where the titans of sports and entertainment can bypass traditional channels to control the narrative through their own production companies or friendly platforms like the Players\u2019 Tribune, a trend which Jordan, it must be said, was decades ahead of the curve on. And ESPN, a rightsholder which pays billions of dollars annually to broadcast NBA games, is hardly the lone culprit in the blurring of journalism and entertainment: Look no further than the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93aE8jXnIag\">Verheoven-flecked pantomime</a> on offer at Fox News or Jeff Zucker\u2019s cringeworthy handiwork at CNN, where the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/e1qRFil9xj0?t=14\">promos for presidential debates</a>, once beamed into America\u2019s living rooms as a public service, wouldn\u2019t feel out of place on Monday Night Raw.</p> <p>Which is all to say The Last Dance might feel like a missed opportunity if there were even an opportunity to miss anymore. It may not be the prestige journalism that ESPN would be happy for it to be mistaken for, but in the newly arrived genre of longform branded content you could do a whole lot worse.</p>",
  "<p>Adam and Eve left the Garden of Eden wearing animal skins to hide the shame of their human flesh. \u201cThe Lord God made clothing\u201d from the skins \u201cfor Adam and his wife\u201d, Genesis 3:21 tells us. In a few Biblical pages, Creator had metamorphosed into Original Skinner. The Italian intellectual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/13/roberto-calasso-interview-the-unnameable-present\">Roberto Calasso</a> takes a dim view of this in his latest meditation on the roots of modernity in ancient myth. \u201cChristian revelation is responsible not only for the declining reverence towards the cosmos \u2026 but also for a certain new, summary and almost brutal way of dealing with animals.\u201d</p> <p>Calasso doesn\u2019t have only Christianity in his crosshairs. What unites Judaism, Christianity and Islam, he thinks, is not just an \u201cobsession about divine oneness\u201d but \u201cthe silent sacrificial war against the animal\u201d. He finds that war prosecuted on the Rue Saint-Jacques in 18th-century Paris. An abb\u00e9 recorded what happened when a pregnant dog rolled over at the feet of Cartesian theologian Nicolas Malebranche. \u201cThe Philosopher gave it a great kick, for which the dog let out a cry of pain and M Fontenelle a cry of compassion. \u2018O, really,\u2019 said Father Malebranche coldly, don\u2019t you know that it feels nothing?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>That war continues today, Calasso argues. The law requires that livestock be stunned before slaughter. \u201cBut the animal suffers above all before being killed. Tormented, constrained, goaded toward death, so that it doesn\u2019t misbehave, doesn\u2019t cause delay.\u201d Each animal follows its Way of Sorrows to a personal Golgotha. \u201cStunning serves to dull the sense of the one who is willing rather than the one being killed. It is a euphemisation of death. Its purpose is to persuade the killer he is killing a creature that is already almost dead.\u201d</p> <p>These thoughts arise in the ninth volume of Calasso\u2019s project. His series of staggeringly learned books started in 1983 with <em><a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/274/274703/the-ruin-of-kasch/9780141397016.html\">The Ruin of Kasch</a></em>, which considered the rise of nationalism and totalitarianism through the prism of diplomacy\u2019s shapeshifting survivor Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord; it will conclude next year with <em>The Book of All Books</em>, a monumental retelling of the Old Testament. In between there have been virtuosic studies of Baudelaire, Tiepolo and Kafka, as well as <em><a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/308/308742/the-unnamable-present/9780141988016.html\">The Unnameable Present</a></em>, a book that suggests that we in the 21st century live in a world of unfixed meanings and constant dread, which certainly resonates with me today. When complete, the series will amount to the testament of a man out of temper with our age of science, progress, material accumulation and Anthropocene hubris.</p> <p>But the 78-year-old\u2019s most abiding concern has been with myth \u2013 Greek, Roman, Egyptian and Vedic. In <em>The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony</em> (1988), still the best introduction to his work, Calasso wrote: \u201cA life in which the gods are not invited is not worth living. It will be quieter, but there won\u2019t be any stories.\u201d There are two kinds of knowledge, he insists, scientific and mythological \u2013 and while he doffs the fedora occasionally to the former, it\u2019s the latter that has made his life worth living and his books worth reading, especially when, as in this latest book, he narrates some captivating passages about divine slap and tickle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"289b1f3ea76ce4d4b88d3ee3763727b1ef5bac51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/289b1f3ea76ce4d4b88d3ee3763727b1ef5bac51/0_0_2468_1804/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Birth of the Milky Way by Rubens (c1636)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"731\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>The Birth of the Milky Way </em>by Rubens (c1636)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Art Archive/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One day, for instance, the infant Heracles was sucking passionately at Hera\u2019s breast while she slept. She awoke, understandably vexed and shook him off, causing spilt milk to spatter across the cosmos. Hence the Milky Way. Then there is Minos who ejaculated scorpions, serpents and centipedes, poor chap, until kindly Procris treated his ailment with a root that grew from the black blood of a dead giant. You\u2019ll be hard pressed to get that on prescription. <br></p> <p><em>The Celestial Hunter</em> thus reconstructs a lost world before we turned into what Hegel called \u201csick animals\u201d, uber-predators who ruined the planet. Palaeoanthropology tells us that things used to be otherwise between us and other creatures. Indeed, there was no us and them. \u201cEverything, from spiders to the dead, occurred within a single flow of forms. It was the realm of metamorphosis,\u201d Calasso asserts. And when hunting began, it was not clear who or what chasing and who or what was being chased. Ovid\u2019s <em>Metamorphoses</em> depicts then an age when we were mutable rather than sick.</p> <p>Man\u2019s detachment from the animal world \u201cwas the great event among all events in history\u201d, Calasso writes. \u201cMan for a long time was a primate among many and, as such lived for a long time in terror of certain predators, knowing that he was one of their favourite foods.\u201d In this, Calasso is exploring similar terrain to the philosopher Timothy Morton, whose 2017 book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/23/humankind-solidarity-with-nonhuman-people-by-timothy-morton-review\">Humankind</a></em> considered what he called \u201cthe Severing\u201d, the moment, 400 generations ago, when we started considering ourselves separate from nature. Calasso supposes that the Severing occurred when human prey started to imitate its predators.</p> <p>We first imitated hyenas who could crush bones with their jaws, using flints and hammers to achieve the same end. No other species kills without touching. For Calasso, we moved from the era of metamorphosis into the age of the prosthesis. We still live in that age, with drones as our latest means of remote-control killing. \u201cThe western way of knowledge was the way of the prosthesis. Technology is nothing less than its culminating moment.\u201d</p> <p>Calasso cites Herodotus\u2019s claim in the <em>Histories</em> (3.108) that lionesses give birth only once because unborn cubs tear uteruses with their claws. \u201cBut if this didn\u2019t happen predators would multiply and would wipe out other animals,\u201d writes Calasso. The suggestion is that this is an example of divine providence. Well, it might be if it were true, but Aristotle and modern zoology are united in suggesting Herodotus\u2019s claim is ridiculous. Nonetheless, humans have done what lions could not; we have become the most formidable of all predators and indeed, as William James put it, \u201cthe only one that preys systematically on his own species\u201d.</p> <p>All this is fascinating enough. But <em>The Celestial Hunter</em> also offers beguiling if abstrusely digressive essays on Plato\u2019s<em> Laws</em>, the nature of Eleusinian mysteries, Zeus\u2019s last night on Earth, Egyptian statuary, the neo-Platonist Plotinus\u2019s disputes with Gnostics \u2013 all infused with the enviable learning of Calasso, whose favoured mode is incontrovertible assertion, sweetened with some lovely poetic passages.</p> <p>He is most compelling when he writes about a favourite theme, sacrifice. Calasso considers sacrificing animals as Sisyphean nightmare whereby the atonement eternally recapitulates the crime. \u201cBlood sacrifice was blood poured over a wrong to heal it \u2013 an operation that always had to be repeated since the wrong was always repeated.\u201d</p> <p>Today, he thinks we still live in a sacrificial society, except we have become sacrificial victims too. Sacrifice \u201cnow means the acceptance of loss by an individual, of some monetary benefit to assist the wellbeing of society as a whole\u201d. But in changing what and why we sacrifice, we have become hopelessly divided against ourselves: the \u201cchoice is between a secular society but one that continues to perform acts of devotion (though now directed to itself) and a society devoted to some divine object which it can no longer recognise\u201d. We may suppose we are better than animals and that we have gone beyond our irrational ancestors, who were steeped in myth, rituals and sacrificial blood. Calasso is vital because he elegantly argues otherwise.</p> <p>\u2022<em> The Celestial Hunter is published by Allen Lane (RRP \u00a325)</em>.</p>",
  "<p>Mindfulness is the last thing I want to practise while running.

Total convert. But full disclosure: I\u2019ve never got to the end. It lasts 36 minutes, and I still don\u2019t run for that long. So it\u2019s partly suspense that keeps me going back.</p> <p>The first principle is, as you would expect, exist in this lap: don\u2019t think about the ones you\u2019ve done, or the ones you\u2019re going to do. Hobbs is running while he records, so you can hear the labour in his voice, the wind picking up and dropping off. It\u2019s strangely calming once you know you can\u2019t get away from it. Concentrate on bits of your body, one at a time. Your feet. We don\u2019t really talk about our feet, unless they hurt, Hobbs observes. This is a fine approach to the body, in my view; don\u2019t talk about it unless it hurts. But we talk about our glutes all the time, he continues. True. My answer to this is to talk less about our glutes. Why am I silently arguing with the mindful running coach? I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just who I am. We do a few more body parts, and 10 minutes have gone by. They went by much faster than they usually do, but this could just be a trick of the new. We move on to eyeline; if you can look 50 metres ahead, your brain will assess obstacles without really troubling your conscious mind, and you\u2019ll find you can clear curbs and manholes, and suchlike, without having to think about it. That\u2019s all well and good, I think, but now I\u2019m no longer living in the moment. I\u2019m living 50 metres ahead. I\u2019m arguing with the voice again. I never used to argue with Maniac.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/11/fit-in-my-40s-the-upsides-of-remote-therapy\">Fit in my 40s: the upsides of remote therapy | Zoe Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Around the 19-minute mark, I was really huffing and puffing, nearing the end of my stamina, but this was when I noticed something odd; it wasn\u2019t that I felt fitter or any less out of breath than normal, but I felt detached: like my body was going through some arduous event, but I was floating above it, completely in control; I could ask it to continue, or I could allow it to stop, and either of those outcomes would simply happen, at my command.

The faster we reopen, the higher the human cost because of more lives lost,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Even Dr Anthony Fauci, the infectious disease expert who has been central to the federal Covid-19 response, addressed the subject. \u201cHow many deaths and how much suffering are you willing to accept?\u201d <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/05/health/us-coronavirus-tuesday/\">he said</a>, adding that states that lifted restrictions were \u201cinviting a rebound\u201d.</p> <p>One reason that states like Nebraska may choose blithely to reopen, despite the risks, is that the impact will not be visible immediately. \u201cIt takes a while for a wave to build,\u201d said Forman. \u201cMy guess is that where states reopen we are going to see the build of a wave sometime late in the summer that will start to be more and more scary.\u201d</p> <p>Topol agreed. \u201cIn the early days of reopening everybody is feeling great. The weather is perfect, people are congregating. Check back in a month and see how it\u2019s going.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This virus has not just exposed but exacerbated the deep, structural racial inequities that have taken the lives of people of color for generations</p> <footer> <cite>Senator Cory Booker</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s another reason for complacency about the virus \u2013 many people can\u2019t see its ravages where they live. As the coronavirus crisis deepens in America, evidence is mounting that its impact is concentrated among certain racial and ethnic groups and elder Americans, often behind closed doors.</p> <p>Though anybody is at risk from the contagion, the virus has rampaged through <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/magazine/oakdale-federal-prison-coronavirus.html\">prisons</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-nursing-homes.html\">nursing homes</a> and exacted an especially heavy toll in African American and other minority communities. \u201cIt is abundantly clear that this virus has not just exposed, but exacerbated, the deep, structural racial inequities that have been taking the lives and livelihoods people of color for generations,\u201d the former Democratic presidential candidate Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cThe stunning health disparities we\u2019ve seen with Covid-19 will not simply disappear as states begin to reopen \u2013 they will remain and get worse. This means communities of color will continue to face heightened health risks due to the president\u2019s reckless and irresponsible guidance.\u201d</p> <p>The pattern that Booker describes is amply illustrated in Nebraska. Here, the pandemic is hitting hardest in the center of the state, where there is a concentration of meatpacking plants with largely immigrant workforces.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are afraid,\u201d said Audrey Lutz, executive director of the <a href=\"http://mcofgi.org/\">Multicultural Coalition</a>, a non-profit working with immigrants in the area. \u201cFear is pervasive. You have to provide for your family, you know a lot of people who are sick, you are maybe sick yourself, so what do you do?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"11046efa7f9314c69d46597e477dca7b2bcad25d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11046efa7f9314c69d46597e477dca7b2bcad25d/0_0_5783_3856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A worker wearing a protective mask disinfects the hand rails on an escalator at NorthPark Center mall in Dallas, Texas, U.S., on Friday, May 1, 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A worker wearing a protective mask disinfects the hand rails on an escalator at NorthPark Center mall in Dallas on 1 May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>JBS Beef, one of the <a href=\"https://www.theindependent.com/news/237-coronavirus-cases-now-tied-to-jbs-beef-plant/article_49820822-83ea-11ea-933d-c3c188ac00fc.html\">most stricken meatpacking plants</a>, has had hundreds of confirmed Covid-19 cases but has stayed open after Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/28/trump-meat-plants-dpa/\">declared</a> meat plants to be \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d. Health authorities have struggled to keep a grip on the plant as an incubator of the disease, a job made next to impossible by the dearth of testing in the area.</p> <p>Lutz said that the national guard was providing 300 tests a day for Hall county and the surrounding health district covering JBS Beef. At that rate it would take 12 days just to test every employee in the plant, let alone the other 80,000 people in the area.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s devastating,\u201d Lutz said. \u201cThe people in power are not affected by the decisions that they make. In our state, those people are white and privileged, while those who have to accept their decisions are minorities and immigrants \u2013 and they are paying a terrible price.\u201d</p>",

According to Virendra Singh, the 22-year-old who was the only one of the group who survived, they had presumed that because trains had been stopped during lockdown, it would be safe to briefly rest on the tracks. They were run over at 5:15am on Friday morning by a train travelling from Mumbai.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe wanted to go back to our village as for the past month and a half there was no work and no money,\u201d said Singh. \u201cWe had started walking at 7pm on Thursday and at 4am everyone\u2019s legs were in pain, and so we took a rest on the tracks. When I heard the train sound from the distance I screamed at them to move, but they were asleep and did not hear, and the train mowed them over.\u201d The train tracks were left littered with the meagre possessions they were carrying, including battered shoes and the few <em>roti </em>they were surviving on.</p> \n  <p>India\u2019s lockdown of its 1.3bn people has been described as one of the largest and harshest in the world, depriving the 80% of India\u2019s workforce who work in the informal sector of a way of earning a living.

He and two of his brothers convicted of embezzlement had been placed in Hall 2 of Wing 4 of the prison on their return as part of a supposed 14-day quarantine.</p> \n  <p>But he was taken away on Tuesday to hospital and his brother on Thursday confirmed that he had been tested positive.

She is waiting to hear if she will be granted clemency or instead returned to jail. Her husband Richard Ratcliffe has asked the UK ambassador to Tehran to visit her in an act of solidarity.</p> \n  <p>Tehran itself was hit by 5.1 earthquake on Thursday night, leading to civilians to rush into the streets for safety.
