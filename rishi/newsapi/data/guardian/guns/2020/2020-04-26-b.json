  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>More US states to end lockdown as US economy worsens</h2> <p>US states Colorado, Mississippi, Minnesota, Montana and Tennessee will join four other states in the lifting of lockdown restrictions, as economists predict an unemployment rate of 16% or higher for the month of April.</p> <h2>Italian PM announces easing of lockdown</h2> <p>Prime minister Giuseppe Conte told the nation in a televised address \u201cif you love Italy, maintain distance\u201d as he announced a plan that will see the country slowly ease lockdown measures from 4 May.</p> <h2>British PM ready to return to work</h2> <p>Prime minister Boris Johnson returned to Downing Street on Sunday evening, where the government is headquartered, for the first time since he was admitted to hospital with Covid-19 on 5 April.</p> <h2>Egypt asks IMF for coronavirus bailout loan</h2> <p>Egypt has asked the International Monitory Fund (IMF) for financial assistance to deal with the economic fallout caused by the coronavirus. With aviation and tourism at a standstill, the partial lockdown threatens the livelihoods of many of Egypt\u2019s 100 million people.</p> <h2><strong>Russia \u2018could experience new spike in cases\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Covid-19 cases in the country could rise sharply if people flout lockdown measures during public holidays scheduled for early May, a top health official said on Sunday, after total reported infections in Russia topped 80,000.</p> <h2><strong>Chile to push ahead with immunity passports</strong></h2> <p>The country is is planning to issue previously announced \u201crelease certificates\u201d for recovered Covid-19 patients \u2018\u201csoon\u201d, despite a World Health Organization warning that it is not clear whether people have immunity after becoming infected.</p> <h2><strong>New York governor outlines lifting of restrictions for parts of state</strong></h2> <p>Andrew Cuomo said some regions such as upstate New York might qualify to open sooner, \u201cwith certain precautions\u201d, as the daily death toll was markedly lower on Sunday than it was on Saturday.</p> <h2><strong>France daily death toll slows</strong></h2> <p>Officially recorded Covid-19 fatalities in France rose by 242 to 22,856 on Sunday, down from 369 new deaths the previous day. The country\u2019s prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/coronavirus-french-pm-to-set-out-road-to-normality-restrictions-ease-in-australia\">said he would present a national exit strategy</a> to parliament on Tuesday, which would then debate and vote on the recommendations.</p> <h2><strong>Germany could introduce right to work from home in future</strong></h2> <p>The country\u2019s labour minister Hubertus Heil is working on legislation that would give employees the right to work from home, even after the current crisis when social distancing will be no longer needed, he said on Sunday.</p> <h2><strong>Israel\u2019s health minister announces resignation</strong></h2> <p>Yaakov Litzman declared that he would step down, following a public uproar over his handling of the coronavirus crisis, such as his initial decision to exclude the ultra-Orthodox community from social distancing regulations.</p>",
  "<p>The number of web pages featuring child sexual abuse that are being taken down globally has plummeted during the coronavirus pandemic, an internet watchdog has said.</p> <p>The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), a UK charity that identifies child sexual abuse content online, said 1,498 URLs were taken down between 16 March and 15 April after being identified as showing child sexual abuse.</p> <p>This was an 89% reduction from the previous month, when 14,947 URLs on the IWF list were taken down.</p> <p>The IWF said this could be because tech companies and law enforcement agencies were operating with reduced numbers of staff and did not have the capacity to take down the material.</p> <p>Last month Facebook\u2019s founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said third-party US content moderators would be working from home and the company would increase its use of artificial intelligence to moderate content during the health crisis.</p> <p>Susie Hargreaves, the chief executive of the IWF, said: \u201cWhat we are seeing here is the first hard evidence of how the global crisis is affecting the fight against child sexual abuse material. Even though our analysts are working as normal to find this evil content, it is staying available for longer, even after they have reported it. This means there is more opportunity for sexual predators to view and share it.\u201d</p> <p>She added:\u201cHotlines and abuse teams across the globe need to be aware that there is a slowdown of this content being removed and to be mindful of doing what they can, within their ability, to get this content taken down.\u201d</p> <p>The IWF provides a list of child sexual abuse URLs, which companies use to block and filter so criminal content is not available through their services. When the imagery has been taken down, the URL comes off the list.</p> <p>The IWF\u2019s annual report says nine out of 10 webpages identified as featuring child sexual abuse, rape or torture are hosted on servers in Europe, with the vast majority held in the Netherlands.</p> <p>In 2019, 89% of URLs known to contain child sexual abuse material were hosted in Europe, compared with 79% in 2018.</p> <p>Of all the content found by the IWF, 71% \u2013 the equivalent of 93,962 URLs \u2013 was hosted in the Netherlands. This was an increase from 2018, when the Netherlands was found to be hosting 47% of all known child sexual abuse material.</p> <p>The Netherlands has become a target for hosting child sexual abuse material due to its strong internet infrastructure, which makes it an easy place for any internet company to operate, offering low-cost hosting services, the IWF said.</p> <p>North America hosted 9% of all known child sexual abuse URLs in 2019, a fall from 18% in 2018, the report says.</p> <p>Hargreaves said the situation could worsen given increased concerns over activities of sexual predators online during the pandemic. Europol, the EU\u2019s law enforcement agency, said early on in the crisis that it had seen \u201cincreased online activity by those seeking child abuse material\u201d.</p> <p>Hargreaves said: \u201cWe have seen a real and frightening jump in the amount of child sexual abuse material that is being hosted right on our doorstep here in Europe. No country is immune to this terrible criminality. While the UK doesn\u2019t have the hosting issue, our problem is that many consumers of child sexual abuse live here. We\u2019ve got to fight this on both fronts \u2013 both the supply and the demand.\u201d</p> <p>The IWF develops tools and provides services for technology companies to prevent the abuse of their platforms for child sexual abuse content.</p> <p>Arda Gerkens, the chief executive of EKOM, which comprises the Dutch hotline for dealing with child sexual abuse as well as the helpline for victims of online sexual abuse, said: \u201cThe Netherlands is unfortunately the biggest webhosting country when it comes to this material. A strong and swift infrastructure combined with low costs, appeals to services that host images. Those services are often abused by people sharing this material.</p> <p>\u201cActing on a notice to take down should be a last resort. It\u2019s best if this material doesn\u2019t come online at all.\u201d</p>",

But workers need confidence that they won\u2019t have to put themselves or their families at unnecessary risk.\u201d</p> \n<p>Polling carried out for the TUC showed 40% of workers are concerned about the health risks of returning to their workplace. O\u2019Grady called for bosses who put the health of their staff at risk to be prosecuted.</p> \n<p>Raab declined to say what physical distancing in schools might mean in practice \u2013 though Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, suggested that in Scotland it could involve staggered attendance by different year groups.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt would not be right or safe to open schools right now and that may continue to be the case for some time to come, but the point I think everybody is trying to get their heads round right now is that as we come out of these very restrictive measures we\u2019re not going to be going back to normality as we knew it,\u201d Sturgeon told Marr.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I described \u2013 and many others have used this phrase \u2013 a new normal that we\u2019re looking for where social distancing will be a fact of life for quite some time to come and different ways of operating will have to be contemplated.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-testing\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-testing&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus-testing</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The shadow education secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, called the government to consult with the teaching unions about how best to manage children\u2019s return to school when it is safe to do so.</p> \n<p>\u201cSchool leaders, teachers and support staff have been working tirelessly to keep children\u2019s education going during this crisis and to minimise disruption and the inevitable impact on social inequality. Any decision to lift restrictions cannot be sprung upon schools at short notice,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>In another sign of the scale of disruption to normal life, the environment secretary, George Eustice, repeated his call for furloughed workers to go to the aid of Britain\u2019s farmers, by picking fruit and vegetables during the harvest season this summer.</p>",

The order has been criticized by Democrats and Republicans because of the state\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/24/opinion/coronavirus-covid-19-georgia-reopen.html\">increasing infection rate and lack of testing</a>.</p> \n<p>Birx\u2019s cautious wording underlined the difficulties faced by health experts working for the administration throughout the pandemic, who have attempted to balance sound scientific advice without directly contradicting haphazard and sometimes dangerous political rhetoric from political figures, including the president.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s promotion of injected disinfectant was only the latest example of reckless promotion of unfounded or potentially harmful medical advice during the pandemic. The president had previously touted an unproven antimalarial drug, hydroxychloroquine, which the FDA has now ruled cannot be used outside of clinical trials or a hospital settings because of its <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-cautions-against-hydroxychloroquine-outside-hospital-setting-n1191266\">potential cardiac risks</a>.</p> \n<p>On Sunday, Dr Birx told CNN she had \u201cmade it clear\u201d to Trump that injected disinfectant \u201cwas not a treatment\u201d, but added the president\u2019s advocacy on the issue should be viewed as a \u201ckind of dialogue will happen\u201d between scientists and politicians.</p> \n<p>Although Trump has not specified where the idea of using injected disinfectant as a possible remedy for Covid-19 came from, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/revealed-leader-group-peddling-bleach-cure-lobbied-trump-coronavirus\">the Guardian revealed on Friday</a> that a prominent group peddling the use of bleach as a \u201cmiracle cure\u201d had written to the president earlier in the week.</p> \n<p>Trump had also pushed the potential use of ultraviolet light on the body as a treatment for coronavirus, pushing research by the Department of Homeland Security exploring how heat and sunlight affect the virus on surfaces. Experts have also <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200327-can-you-kill-coronavirus-with-uv-light\">long cautioned against the dangerous, potentially lethal side effects of UV light</a> on the human body.</p> \n<h2>Hogan: hundreds of hotline calls after Trump comments</h2> \n<p>On Sunday, Birx also sought to distance herself from the president\u2019s suggestion, and instead cited research from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that suggested sunlight can affect the aerosolization of the virus outdoors.</p> \n<p>The back-and-forth comes as senior state Republicans showed signs of being more forceful in their criticism of Trump\u2019s wild claims.</p> \n<p>Larry Hogan, the Republican governor of Maryland, told ABC News on Sunday that the state received \u201chundreds of calls come into our emergency hotline at our health department asking if it was right to ingest Clorox or alcohol cleaning products \u2013 whether that was going to help them fight the virus\u201d.</p> \n<p>The calls forced the governor to issue a warning against doing so.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think when misinformation comes out or you just say something that pops in your head, it does send a wrong message,\u201d Hogan added, with reference to Trump\u2019s press conferences.</p> \n<p>Trump indicated over the weekend he could halt the daily press briefings that have underpinned his shambolic response to the pandemic, drawing widespread criticism for their similarity to campaign rallies rather than public health briefings.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/coronavirus-west-coast-small-businesses\">'Haven't seen a dime': five small businesses on the struggle to survive a pandemic</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cWhat is the purpose of having White House News Conferences when the Lamestream Media asks nothing but hostile questions, &amp; then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately,\u201d he tweeted on Saturday at roughly the same time in the evening that the briefing would have taken place.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey get record ratings, &amp; the American people get nothing but Fake News.

  "<p>Packed pools, beaches and tour buses, as well as middle seats on planes, hotel minibars and scrums at airport check-ins, may all be a thing of the past as Europe\u2019s tourism industry attempts to reimagine the holiday in the wake of the coronavirus.</p> \n<p>Travel will take place only under \u201cspecific new rules\u201d, Greece\u2019s tourism minister has said as he prepares to propose ways of salvaging the sector with his EU counterparts in the era of Covid-19 on Monday.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we are to think of the possibility of travelling this year it has to be under specific new rules,\u201d says Harry Theoharis, the country\u2019s tourism minister , whose economy is especially dependent on the sector. \u201cWe have to have new rules for hotels, new rules for beaches, new rules for pools, new rules for breakfast buffets, new rules for tour buses.\u201d</p> \n<p>How the regulations will work, and what they will look like, in Europe at least, will be the focus of talks between EU tourism ministers on Monday. Health and safety measures, including Covid-19 immunity certificates, will be high on the agenda. The possibility of passengers being subject to temperature checks and pre-flight blood tests is also likely to be raised.</p> \n<p>\u201cI will be pushing for agreement on a common set of [EU] rules,\u201d Theoharis told the Guardian. \u201cWe need them if we are to start moving people from one country to another by road, air or sea. Temporary rules that will have to make economic sense. If, for example, you can only fly with 10 people on a plane to be deemed safe then obviously there will be no flight,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Global tourism has been among the hardest hit industries by the public health emergency, impacting the lives of some 75 million people employed in an industry brought to a near standstill by travel bans and closed borders. In Greece, where tourism accounts for 20% of GDP and provides one in five jobs, the economy is expected to suffer an immense blow \u2013 contracting by as much as 10% - just as it was emerging from its worst crisis in recent times.</p> \n<p>Theoharis, who assumed the post last July when the centre-right government was catapulted into office, predicts the country could have \u201cless than a third\u201d of the tourists it hosted last year.</p> \n<p>In 2019, Greece attracted a record 33 million arrivals, more than three times its total population, and double the number it lured a decade ago. The boom brought in an unprecedented \u20ac18.2bn \u2013 revenue that played a crucial role in reviving an economy thrown into depression by a near-decade long public debt crisis that cut output by a quarter.</p> \n<p>On the back of mass cancellations, the Hellenic chamber of hotels forecasts that 65% of its members could be forced to declare bankruptcy. Christina Tetradis, who runs a resort on the Ionian isle of Zakynthos and is the chamber\u2019s vice-president, says any desire to resurrect tourism is also tempered by concerns over keeping Greece virus-free. Industry figures, she says, are acutely aware of the dangers inherent in removing travel restrictions too fast. \u201cNo one wants to blamed for putting staff at risk or endangering lives.\u201d</p> \n<p>But, like Theoharis, she is also persuaded that Athens\u2019 handling of the pandemic will reap rewards.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In contrast to other European countries, Greece, which is poised to ease lockdown measures with the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, addressing the nation on Tuesday, applied tough restrictions to contain coronavirus early on.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen health and security are so important for travellers worldwide, the way the government has managed to keep the numbers down does, I think, give us a competitive edge,\u201d said Tetradis. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be complicated especially for bigger hotels. There are so many questions, like how many people can you have in a pool, are buffets out and what if someone falls sick? But there is also a sense of safety regarding coronavirus that we can project too.\u201d</p> \n<p>With 2,517 confirmed cases of the disease and a death toll of 134, Greece has to date fared far better on the Covid-19 battlefront than expected.</p> \n<p>Turkey to its east and Italy to its west have suffered hugely, by Sunday registering mortality rates of 2,706 and 26,386 respectively.</p> \n<p>Reimagining travel will be as paramount to tourism\u2019s survival as the precautions needed to prevent possible infections, say officials. After the 9/11 <sup> </sup>terror attacks in 2001 the sector took three years to recover but rose dramatically when it rebounded.</p> \n<p>Theoharis acknowledges that the future is fraught with uncertainty. Already, fears abound of a second wave of the epidemic later this year and, ultimately, much will depend on the discovery of a vaccine.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/coronavirus-nearly-60-new-cases-found-on-cruise-ship-in-japan\">Coronavirus: global death toll passes 200,000 as more countries prepare to reopen</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But if the warm weather brings a reprieve, as epidemiologists hope, Greece, he says, could open to holidaymakers in July \u2013 later than usual but in time for the peak summer months when most revenue is made.</p> \n<p>Selective tourism is not ruled out: traditional markets in the UK, Germany and France, may be replaced by tourists from eastern and central Europe used to accessing the country by car if air links continue to be suspended.</p> \n<p>\u201cOnce measures are relaxed a good month will be required to prepare the ground for the [tourism] engine to get started,\u201d he said. \u201cTour operators are waiting and hoping we can come up with the right rules so that we can start bringing visitors in.

  "<p>So concludes the election campaign to be World Rugby\u2019s top dog. Voting has begun, though we will not know for sure whether Bill Beaumont or Agust\u00edn Pichot has prevailed for more than two weeks. There are, of course, mitigating circumstances but, as convoluted processes go, you might have thought lessons would be learned from the contest to host the 2023 World Cup (more on that later).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/23/european-clubs-collision-course-world-rugby-unacceptable-fixture-plans\">European clubs on collision course with World Rugby over 'unacceptable' plans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It may yet prove to be the smoothest of ballots, but a fortnight is a long time in sports politics. That the vote is secret and heavily weighted so that the Six Nations countries each get three votes, Fiji or the USA one, serves only to muddy the waters further.</p> <p>On to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/21/world-rugby-administration-needs-to-work-many-not-few\">candidates</a> and Beaumont has had a trying couple of weeks, what with his campaign being backed by a convicted killer who has been condemned by Amnesty International. The Fiji rugby union chairman, Francis Kean, has been denied a visa for the US but astonishingly he emerged as a key supporter of Beaumont\u2019s bid. It is just one of this campaign\u2019s great ironies that a key part of Sir Bill\u2019s manifesto is a fit and proper persons test for elected officials.</p> <p>To briefly recap, Beaumont has been nominated by France and seconded by Fiji. In turn, Bernard Laporte, who is running unopposed as his vice-chairman, has been nominated by the Rugby Football Union while Kean was seconded by France for a role on World Rugby\u2019s executive committee. This was all announced nearly two weeks ago but then fresh allegations of homophobia by Kean came to light and Beaumont had to act, with Fiji pressured to stand down Kean from the World Rugby council and the election. Meanwhile, Fiji\u2019s vote falls to Frank Bainimarama, the president of the union and who happens to be Kean\u2019s brother-in-law and his country\u2019s prime minister. Bainimarama, lest we forget, took charge of the country in 2006 via military coup.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e2524fe8d7e6b76a1fd9a7f01734fd102646d0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e2524fe8d7e6b76a1fd9a7f01734fd102646d0d/0_68_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Agust\u00edn Pichot in action for Argentina at Twickenham in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Agust\u00edn Pichot in action for Argentina at Twickenham in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Hevezi/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is against this backdrop that Beaumont has also had to deal with the white knight in white trainers coming up the rails. Pichot has portrayed himself as the underdog but he has gathered late momentum. For this is an election fought on the north-south divide, the traditionalist Beaumont against the revolutionary Pichot, the dinosaur versus the dynamo. Accordingly, Beaumont has undergone a bit of a rebrand, trying to come across as a bit more avuncular. Pichot has called for a new rugby computer game to spin the world game on its axis, Beaumont insists: \u201cI\u2019m not bad with modern technology.\u201d You get the gist.</p> <p>While Beaumont has the backing of the European stronghold, Pichot has the Sanzaar votes and has been canvassing for the support of the tier two nations. This new radical wants to shake up the existing order. Indeed, Pichot wants to spread the British &amp; Irish Lions gospel in the Americas. That\u2019s Argentina\u2019s Pichot, who was appointed to the USA Rugby board in late 2018.</p> <p>There is also the matter of the 2027 World Cup. Argentina had been expected to bid but Pichot recently revealed that was no longer the case and instead the union would be getting behind Australia. Pichot\u2019s nomination in the election was seconded by Rugby Australia. It is only a couple of years ago that RA was furious to learn of his<a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/sport/rugby-union/twiggy-recruits-world-rugby-deputy-to-head-mining-push-in-argentina-20180816-p4zxwd.html\"> relationship with the Australian iron ore billionaire Andrew \u2018Twiggy\u2019 Forrest</a> \u2013 the brains behind the rebel World Series Rugby competition.</p> <p>Indeed, eyebrows were raised when he appointed Pichot, not previously famous for being an expert in the field, as head of his South American mining operation. So much so that one of RA\u2019s leading officials, Brett Robinson,<a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/sport/rugby-union/twiggy-recruits-world-rugby-deputy-to-head-mining-push-in-argentina-20180816-p4zxwd.html\"> reportedly demanded that Pichot declare his conflict of interest</a> to World Rugby. It seems the pair have made up, however, because Robinson\u2019s nomination to World Rugby\u2019s executive committee was seconded by the Argentinian union.</p> <p>Beaumont and Pichot have spent the past four years as chairman and vice-chairman respectively, but this election battle has long since been coming. According to one well-placed source, they were \u201cwatching each other\u2019s every move\u201d throughout the Japan World Cup and their manifestos do not differ greatly from each other. But while Pichot has decided to go it alone, Beaumont has enlisted Laporte\u2019s services. And Laporte is a political animal.</p> <p>It was he who, despite an official recommendation that South Africa should be awarded the 2023 World Cup, convinced the voters to plump for France. It seems likely Laporte fancies a crack at the top job, a year after delivering that tournament, and while that 2023 fiasco came at great embarrassment to Beaumont, clearly he recognised the Frenchman\u2019s influence. Indeed, it was Laporte who almost convinced the uber-conservative Six Nations to back the Nations Championship proposal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/21/world-rugby-administration-needs-to-work-many-not-few\">Trad turkeys of World Rugby unlikely to vote for Christmas on election day</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Having Laporte as his No 2 has not been without its difficulties, however. There is his role in the Kean affair and Beaumont was also forced to row back on Laporte\u2019s recent claims that World Rugby would run a proposed Club World Cup and the Champions Cup would be ditched as a result. It is unlikely that was a slip of the tongue by Laporte who, crucially, understands the balance of power within the global game and just how much of it lies with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/25/premiership-rugby-union-clubs-in-danger-funding-shortfall-from-paused-season\">clubs in England</a> and France.</p> <p>We have heard plenty about a new-found cooperation between unions and clubs in recent weeks, but already the cracks are beginning to show. World Rugby wants to play Tests in October, the European clubs have balked at the idea. The best way to interpret Laporte\u2019s comments is as planting a flag, the Frenchman aware that the coronavirus crisis has rendered the clubs weaker than usual. Because, for all that Beaumont and Pichot have both promised change, it will only happen with the say-so of the clubs, regardless of whoever accrues most votes on 12 May.</p>",

Consensus estimates suggest it will put aside $622m (\u00a3502m) in the first quarter, having already warned that it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/27/standard-chartered-misses-growth-targets-amid-coronavirus-fears\">miss financial targets for 2020.</a> Pre-tax profits are forecast to fall by a third, to $796m.</p> <p>Domestic banks in the UK have been scrambling to grant mortgage and credit card repayment holidays to retail customers and dole out government-backed loans for small businesses hit by the outbreak.

They \u201cset cheeky challenges to each other, like taking pictures in some sort of theme \u2013 such as with water, kissing or chocolate\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/16/self-love-in-isolation-i-hope-people-are-using-this-time-to-explore-their-sexuality\">Self-love in isolation: 'I hope people are using this time to explore their sexuality'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHaving said that, we also discuss parenting and current life struggles as well as successes and maybe the yummy food we have been making. It\u2019s a space to be real,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Rosy isn\u2019t alone in exploring her sexual side through naked photographs and erotic texts during the Covid-19 lockdown. On 22 April, actor Ansel Elgort teased his followers on Instagram by<a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/ansel-elgort-nude-photo-instagram.html\"> posting a nude photograph</a> and suggesting he had set up an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/06/can-one-site-change-what-a-porn-star-is-supposed-to-look-like\">Only Fans</a> account. Although the post was for charity, he deleted it a few hours later. Meanwhile, social media influencer<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/12/who-is-caroline-calloway-and-why-cant-the-internet-stop-talking-about-her\"> Caroline Calloway</a> really did launch a profile on the subscription-based pornography service, and <a href=\"https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/whos-actually-horny-on-main-when-everyones-horny-on-main\">claims she will make US$80,000 </a>from the account by the end of the year.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s a way of being intimate in a time where we actually can\u2019t touch each other</p> <footer> <cite>Tanya Koens</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Clinical and somatic sexologist Tanya Koens reflects that the current crisis is impacting people\u2019s intimate online behaviour. Yet it\u2019s not just that people are bored and horny \u2013 there\u2019s more to it.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are feeling very vulnerable and they are feeling scared. They don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. When we\u2019re facing death, we tend to become much more vibrant in wanting to be alive,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Koens believes people are turning to sexting and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/01/nude-selfies-what-if-they-are-just-an-ordinary-part-of-teenage-life\"> nudes</a> because it\u2019s \u201chooking into our desires. It\u2019s hooking into our desirability. It\u2019s hooking into our body. It\u2019s special because this isn\u2019t something that we do with everybody [and] it\u2019s a way of being intimate in a time where we actually can\u2019t touch each other\u201d.</p> <p>Sexting \u2013 in case you aren\u2019t familiar \u2013 is using text, images, photos, video and audio to get saucy with someone online. Right now the practice is having a heyday. What\u2019s more, people are using their creativity to sext in varied and unexpected ways. Koens notes that some groups of friends \u2013 such as the Cheeky Chicks \u2013 are sending nude images to each other too \u201cfor shits and giggles\u201d.</p> <p>However, others, such as 41-year-old public servant Mia*, are sexting their crushes one to one. And not just a bit. But a lot. Mia says: \u201cI\u2019ve been enjoying sharing a long fantasy of: \u2018What I\u2019d do if we were locked in the steamy spa room at my gym together\u2019 texts with my bloke.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like the end of the world, so all the basic urges like cooking, sleeping and fucking are really important again,\u201d Mia says. \u201cThe isolation is ramping up the desire to connect. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/16/self-love-in-isolation-i-hope-people-are-using-this-time-to-explore-their-sexuality\">Vibrators and self-love</a> don\u2019t cut it right now. It needs to be more.\u201d</p> <p>Our feelings of isolation and fear are causing us to reach out and connect in a far more vulnerable way. Take 51-year-old legal professional, Jennifer*, as another example. She thinks back a few weeks: \u201cAt the start of the crisis, anxiety was peaking, and I was standing in the supermarket crying.\u201d</p> <p>This prompted Jennifer to send her best friend of 25 years, who lives interstate, a message along the lines of: \u201cI would give anything to see him just so he could hug me.\u201d</p> <p>A phone call followed, and the relationship quickly evolved into regular sexting between the pair. \u201cIt\u2019s like a sexy story just for me where I am beautiful and desirable. That\u2019s an intoxicating feeling,\u201d she says.</p> <p>While exploring new forms of intimacy can be a thrill, Rosy wants to underscore something crucial: \u201cNo one is forced to put something up and you engage at the level you feel comfortable at.\u201d</p> <p>Koens says people sext for all kinds of reasons. \u201cWhen we flirt with somebody we get a little bit of an extra spring in our step \u2026 It can be very validating to have somebody responding positively to messages that you\u2019re writing or imagery or voicemails that you are sending.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/21/single-people-living-with-couples-coronavirus-lockdown\">'I\u2019m so starved for human touch': a hell of its own for single people living with couples</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just like with face-to-face sexual interactions, consent is king when it comes to sexting. \u201cIf you\u2019re having sexy banter and you want to up the ante and send a recording or an image, you need to check first,\u201d says Koens. \u201c\u2018Would you be open to receiving some images of me? Would you be open to receiving naked images of me? Would you be open to seeing pictures of my genitals?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cPeople say that\u2019s not sexy [to ask] and I\u2019m telling you that\u2019s incorrect \u2026 Once you\u2019ve got permission, you have zero risk of offending somebody.\u201d</p> <p>When wanting to turn the chat to sexy talk, Koens has noticed that men can often \u201cpressure\u201d women into sending images. Anecdotally, more of this fishing <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_CnGYThidx/\">seems to be happening</a> at the moment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_CnGYThidx/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

  "<p>Like most Australians, George* has spent the better part of the past two months trying to stay at home.

While people like George are managing to find a way through the crisis, experts are concerned that rising substance abuse fuelled by the virus, coupled with new restrictions on an already over-burdened drug and alcohol rehabilitation system, could see Australia staring down a crisis in addiction.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re really concerned about what\u2019s coming down the line in the next six months,\u201d Leone Crayden, the chief executive of The Buttery, a rehabilitation centre near Byron Bay on the New South Wales far north coast, says.</p> <p>\u201cWe know alcohol sales are up, we know anecdotally in our community that people are hoarding prescription medicines. It\u2019s early days yet, but this is what is happening and I just hope governments are aware of it.\u201d</p> <p>Problems in drug and alcohol treatment in Australia did not begin with Covid-19.</p> <p>Earlier this year, a special independent commission, appointed to investigate the rise of crystal methamphetamine addiction in New South Wales, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/27/landmark-nsw-inquiry-condemns-ineffective-drug-laws-and-calls-for-decriminalisation\">highlighted a \u201csignificant and long-standing unmet demand for treatment\u201d in Australia</a>. The commission estimated that between 200,000 and 500,000 people were unable to access treatment for drug and alcohol addiction each year, and a survey of residential rehabilitation facilities in NSW found 21% had wait times of between three and six months.</p> <p>There are also significant gaps in treatment. Before entering residential rehabilitation, most facilities require clients to undergo a period of detoxification. But the inquiry found those services were often not well linked, creating a significant risk of relapse between detoxification and entering rehabilitation. Other forms of treatment are simply not widely available. In 2016 the federal government made the drug Naloxone, which works as an antidote to opioid overdoses, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/29/selling-opioid-overdose-antidote-naloxone-over-counter-will-save-lives\">available over the counter without a prescription in Australian pharmacies</a>. But other issues such as cost remain a significant barrier. While the commonwealth government has been trialling free Naloxone access in three states, a new study released this week found the over-the-counter sale of the drug had not substantially increased since it was rescheduled.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/americans-addiction-rrelapse-coronavirus\">Recovering addicts more at risk of relapse amid coronavirus, experts warn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rehabilitation centres and addiction specialists say these issues have all been exacerbated by Covid-19, as services see an increase in demand at the same time as their capacity is severely restricted by the virus.</p> <p>At the medically supervised injecting centre in Sydney\u2019s Kings Cross, director Marianne Jauncey says social distancing measures mean their capacity has been reduced from 18 to nine clients at any given time.

During one week in April, spending on online wagering increased by 67% while expenditure on alcohol and tobacco increased by 33%, <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/alarming-rise-in-online-gambling-has-experts-worried-20200408-p54ics.html\">according to a consumer spending database collated by analytics consultancy AlphaBeta and credit firm Illion</a>.</p> <p>The link between stress and substance abuse or damaging behaviours is well established. Following the devastating Christchurch earthquake in 2011, <a href=\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/canterbury-earthquake/80975/concern-at-rise-in-gambling-in-christchurch\">spending on poker machines in the city tripled</a>. Despite a significant drop in tourism and an exodus of some 10,000 residents from the city, revenue from gambling rose by almost $4m against a downward national trend.</p> <p>Amanda Curran, vice-president of the Australian Association of Psychologists and a registered psychologist, says factors such as lack of stimulation, increased stress particularly around finances and potential illness are all driving increased rates of substance use.</p> <p>\u201cOn top of that, the disconnect from social support systems such as friends, neighbours, therapists, church and family can contribute significantly to mental strain,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cFor those in recovery, the lack of access to support services is a major concern. Those who were traditionally involved in support groups such as AA or NA may not have computer access to attend online meetings, and they are particularly at risk here.\u201d</p> <p>Treatment centres such as The Buttery are already seeing the effects of the virus. Crayden tells the Guardian that since lockdown rules came into place the centre has seen a significant increase in calls from people worried about drug and alcohol consumption.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting more calls to our intake line from people saying, \u2018look, my partner had a lot of control around their drinking or substance use previously because they worked and had their routines, but that\u2019s not happening any more, so the 6pm beer is turning into the 12pm beer\u2019,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cPeople have their own harm reduction minimisation strategies \u2013 eating well, sleeping well, keeping busy, exercising and just having a purpose. Well a lot of people have been stood down, they\u2019re not working and so they don\u2019t have that purpose. We\u2019re all anxious about contracting coronavirus, about our families. We\u2019re seeing a lot of calls from young mums who are overwhelmed with home schooling. So there\u2019s a lot of anxiety and fear around and we know people self-medicate to deal with that.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, Crayden says, The Buttery has been unable to accept any new residential rehabilitation clients since the virus hit. While it is finding innovative ways to continue client outreach \u2013 including buying phones and laptops for those without access to technology \u2013 she fears the 90 people already on their waitlist face additional challenges while they work on a strategy to allow them to take new clients.</p> <p>Anecdotal reports of increased substance use coupled with hobbled treatment options has prompted Suzanne Nielsen, the deputy director of the Monash Addiction Research Centre, to warn of a potential for a syndemic \u2013 two endemics operating at the same time.</p> <p>Australia was already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/13/he-was-gone-fentanyl-and-the-opioid-deaths-destroying-australian-families\">grappling with an escalating crisis with opioid-related disease and death rates</a> before Covid-19, and Nielsen fears that unless authorities begin considering the risk of a rise in addiction rates the problem could get worse. While she says easing access to methadone was a good step, governments could do things like expanding the number of medically supervised injecting centres and increasing free access to naloxone.</p> <p>\u201cObviously when people inject drugs it\u2019s often multiple times a day, so if you\u2019re really going to reduce the risks associated with that the injecting room really needs to be in your local area so you are able to attend without travelling long distances,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cIn cities as large and geographically diverse as Melbourne and Sydney it really doesn\u2019t make sense to have one place. Kings Cross is no longer the epicentre of injecting in Sydney and we absolutely need more of these services so we can have more equitable access to them.\u201d</p> <p>Jauncey agrees, pointing to a 2019 recommendation by the NSW deputy coroner Harriet Grahame for a feasibility study into a new injecting centre in Sydney\u2019s south-west after <a href=\"http://www.coroners.justice.nsw.gov.au/Documents/7.%20FINAL%20Bugden%20and%20Bestrin%20findings%20-%20redacted.pdf\">25-year-old Amaru Bestrin died of a heroin overdose in a publicly accessible toilet at Liverpool hospital</a>.</p> <p>\u201cPeople take drugs where they get drugs,\u201d Jauncey said. \u201cWe know injecting centres are not a honeypot, so you need to put these services where the market is.\u201d</p> <p>All of the experts the Guardian has spoken to are also concerned about a changing market profile in illicit drugs. In the same way that the shutdown of major sporting codes has seen online sports betting websites simply shift to offering odds on obscure leagues such as Russian table tennis and Nicaraguan football, experts warn a potential heroin shortage caused by border closures could lead to unintended consequences.</p> <p>When Australia experienced a significant heroin drought in early 2001, the country saw a 67% reduction in fatal and nonfatal opioid overdoses. But there is also evidence that many long-term users simply <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1524737/\">switched to other substances such as prescription benzodiazepines</a>.</p> <p>Nielsen says evidence from overseas, and in particular the US, suggests that \u201csupply shocks\u201d in the heroin market could lead users to more dangerous drugs such as the prescription opioid fentanyl.</p> <p>\u201cWe have seen in other countries that when there have been supply shocks it can be a time when more potent drugs are introduced,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cFentanyl is an obvious candidate because it\u2019s easier to ship and because of its potency. It\u2019s one of those things where we just don\u2019t know which way it will go because we don\u2019t have the data yet.\u201d</p> <p>Jauncey says the potential for users to shift to fentanyl analogues and crystal methamphetamine is a significant concern for those in the industry.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a vexed issue. We are all expecting to see a change in availability and when you see that there\u2019s a change in access, supply and strength,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t make heroin in Australia, all of it is imported from south-east Asia and China, where we have very established trade routes which have now been interrupted.</p> <p>\u201cAt some level it\u2019s crystal ball gazing. But we know when there is a market shock you do see increased treatment seeking. What I hope happens is the treatments are there and available and we\u2019re ready for them. One of the not-so-good outcomes is people can potentially start using other substances, which can be more harmful.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the risk of fentanyl and high-potency analogous. The other thing the sector is concerned about is an increase of local methamphetamine. We don\u2019t make our own heroin but we do make our own methamphetamine.\u201d</p> <p>*not his real name.</p>",

  "<h2>1. Leaving lockdown?</h2> <p>Pressure has been mounting from backbench Conservative MPs \u2013 and some cabinet ministers \u2013 for elements of the stringent distancing rules imposed on 23 March to be lifted.</p> <p>Whitehall has been working on options \u2013 \u201cdoing the homework\u201d, as Johnson\u2019s deputy, Dominic Raab, put it on Sunday \u2013 but ministers have been reluctant to make any decisions without the prime minister.</p> <p>The health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, is determined that the transmission rate of the virus \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/apr/22/see-how-coronavirus-can-spread-through-a-population-and-how-countries-flatten-the-curve\">the R0, as it is known</a> \u2013 be suppressed well below 1 before the lockdown is eased. He is also racing to get a track-and-trace system up and running to help control the virus when restrictions are eased.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who unlike Hancock was present at a three-hour meeting in Chequers on Friday, is known to be keen to allow some businesses to reopen, given the catastrophic impact of a total shutdown on the economy.</p> <p>There are also growing anxieties over the impact of an extended lockdown on mental and physical health, domestic abuse and the welfare of vulnerable children.</p> <p>Johnson will have to make the ultimate decision about how to balance these and other concerns, with a formal review of the measures due by 7 May.</p> <h2>2. Test, test, test</h2> <p>Matt Hancock\u2019s self-imposed deadline of completing 100,000 tests a day by the end of April expires this week.</p> <p>Capacity has ramped up significantly in recent days, with all key workers now able to apply for a test \u2013 but self-administered testing kits have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/england-and-wales-coronavirus-test-slots-and-kits-run-out-again\">running out within minutes on the government\u2019s website</a>, and workers have complained that they cannot book a test slot anywhere locally.</p> <p>The government announced at the weekend that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/26/uk-military-to-operate-coronavirus-mobile-testing-units-for-frontline-workers\">the army will now be involved </a>in setting up mobile testing units.</p> <p>Hancock has insisted his goal remains achievable \u2013 but it looks a stretch, and some colleagues feel it was always a hostage to fortune.</p> <p>Johnson will have to choose whether to maintain No 10\u2019s staunch backing of Hancock, or to distance himself from the pledge (though the prime minister himself suggested 250,000 tests a day would be achievable).</p> <p>He will also have to decide how much of the government\u2019s effort should be focused on the tracking-and-testing approach Hancock now regards as crucial.</p> <h2>3. Deciding who makes decisions, and how</h2> <p>Johnson will have to decide whether the decision-making structure in place through the peak of the crisis remains the right one for managing its next phase.</p> <p>In his absence, key decisions have been made by a \u201cquad\u201d of ministers: Sunak, Hancock, Raab and the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, each of whom chair one of the four powerful Covid-19 committees that have been managing the government\u2019s day-to-day response.</p> <p>At key turning points, decisions have also been rubber-stamped by the Cobra emergency committee, which includes representatives of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London, as well as ministers and experts.</p> <p>In turn, Cobra receives advice from the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage). The government has repeatedly insisted its approach has been \u201cled by the science\u201d, but the independence of Sage has been thrown into doubt by the revelation that Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, has been attending its meetings, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/attendees-of-sage-coronavirus-meetings-worried-by-presence-of-dominic-cummings\">to the disquiet of some members</a>.</p> <p>The prime minister will have to decide whether Cummings should continue to attend and more broadly, which stakeholders should be included in decision-making from now on.</p> <p>Some Tory MPs would like to see the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, bound in to deliberations about lifting lockdown, for example \u2013 and as parts of the economy reopen, the TUC have called for the formation of a national council for reconstruction and recovery, including unions and employers as well as government.</p> <h2>4. Addressing his own handling of the crisis</h2> <p>Keir Starmer confronted Raab at his first prime minister\u2019s questions as Labour leader in a largely empty House of Commons chamber last Wednesday.</p> <p>This week, it will be Johnson who has to face an interrogation, without the usual supportive roar from Tory backbenchers. It comes amid mounting questions about whether the prime minister was slow to react to the crisis at the start of the year: including whether he was right to allow Hancock to lead five early Cobra meetings on the virus.</p> <p>A series of early decisions have been challenged, including halting the tracing of cases, allowing mass events such as the Cheltenham Festival to go ahead, and failing to act quickly enough to secure supplies of PPE.</p> <p>Starmer made clear in a letter to the prime minister this weekend he will try to make some of this criticism stick \u2013 and will continue to press for more details on the government\u2019s planned exit strategy.</p> <p>\u201cI fear we are falling behind the rest of the world,\u201d the Labour leader wrote, urging Johnson to promise that no one will have to travel more than 20 minutes to have themselves tested for the virus.</p> <h2>5. The Brexit impasse</h2> <p>The latest round of the (physically distanced) Brexit talks ended on Friday, with both sides blaming the other for the lack of progress.</p> <p>The government is accusing the EU of treating the UK more harshly than other counterparts in recent trade deals, while the EU fears ministers are backsliding on aspects of the Brexit deal struck last October.</p> <p>Boris Johnson is expected to ask the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and EU leaders to intervene in the negotiations in the hope of breaking the deadlock.</p> <p>The government must decide in June whether to seek an extension to the status quo transition period, something ministers have repeatedly insisted they are determined not to do.</p> <p>Only two more rounds of videoconference negotiations are currently scheduled, but Johnson may hope that his personal involvement could help, as it did last autumn.</p> <p>Gove is likely to reveal more about the government\u2019s thinking when he appears before the House of Commons EU future relationship committee on Monday.</p> <h2>6. The Priti Patel bullying inquiry</h2> <p>The Whitehall ethics adviser Alex Allan has reportedly completed his investigation into events surrounding the resignation of the former Home Office permanent secretary Sir Philip Rutnam, who accused Priti Patel of bullying \u2013 but it was set aside in the prime minister\u2019s absence.</p> <p>Rutnam resigned on 29 February, claiming he had been \u201cthe target of a vicious and orchestrated briefing campaign\u201d .</p> <p>He has already announced that he is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/20/priti-patel-bullying-row-ex-home-office-chief-philip-rutnam-launches-tribunal-claim\">taking legal action against Patel under whistleblowing laws</a>, with the case expected to focus on her treatment of civil servants.</p> <p>The prime minister tasked Allan with examining Patel\u2019s alleged conduct, and whether it contravened the ministerial code. Johnson has previously backed Patel, saying he is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/04/pm-backs-priti-patel-saying-doing-outstanding-job-corbyn\">\u201csticking by her\u201d</a>, but that could change if Allan finds she has broken the rules.</p>",
  "<p>Boris Johnson is expected to push for an intervention from EU leaders in the faltering trade and security negotiations with the bloc after being warned by advisers that the current talks are on course to fail.</p> <p>There is recognition on both sides of the talks that there is little prospect of agreement on the most contentious issues without a major reset of positions.</p> <p>With the prime minister set to return to Downing Street on Monday, Johnson is expected to press the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and EU nation governments to dedicate attention to the negotiation with the British government.</p> <p>Sources suggested that there would need to be a rethink over the next fortnight in order to rescue the negotiation. The UK will leave the single market and customs union at the end of 2020, after which tariffs will be applied to the trade in goods unless there is a deal agreed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/24/who-and-what-uk-and-eu-resume-interupted-brexit-talks-future-relationaship\">Brexit talks: who is involved and what is being covered?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both sides have said they need to see progress by June, with Downing Street warning that they may need to walk away from the talks at that point to prepare solely for a no-deal outcome.</p> <p>There are just two scheduled rounds of video-conference talks, and senior sources on both sides said these were not likely to deliver a deal, due to principled differences as well as the difficulties presented by the technology.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t see all the faces of the people around the table; you don\u2019t see the body language, you cannot have discussion in the margins\u201d, an EU official said. \u201cBut having said that, this is how we are working now; we need to make the best of it.\u201d</p> <p>The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and his British counterpart, David Frost, came out fighting from last week\u2019s round of talks on the future relationship, only the second since the UK left the EU on 31 January.</p> <p>Barnier accused the UK of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/24/britain-running-down-the-clock-in-brexit-talks-says-michel-barnier-eu\">not engaging with key issues</a> of particular importance to the EU, including access to British waters for European fishing fleet and the so-called level playing field conditions to ensure neither side can undercut environmental, labour and social standards.</p> <p>EU sources added that UK officials \u201clistened politely\u201d to their proposals but did not seek to negotiate on them. \u201cI regret it, and this worries me\u201d, Barnier told reporters at a press conference at the end of last week\u2019s talks.</p> <p>The British negotiating team has rejected the claim, instead questioning the value of the deal being proposed by Brussels, which would tie the UK to EU regulations while also constructing significant non-tariff barriers on trade.</p> <p>Whitehall sources said there was a difference between not engaging and simply disagreeing with the EU approach. There is a particular frustration on the UK side that the EU has rejected proposals to remove unnecessary technical barriers to trade, including some sanitary and phytosanitary checks on animal products, despite British commitments to maintain high standards and there being precedent in previous trade deals.</p> <p>On security cooperation, the UK has argued in the negotiating room that the EU\u2019s offer is based on existing deals but comes with unprecedented obligations, including a direct role for the European court of justice in dispute settlements: a red line for Downing Street.</p> <p>Two areas in which there have been better talks are civil nuclear cooperation and UK involvement in EU programmes. \u201cThe UK has expressed interest in participating in [the research and science programme] Horizon, for example\u201d, said an EU official. \u201cSo there\u2019s certainly some useful discussions ongoing in this area.\u201d</p> <p>However, there is growing concern about the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/02/uk-government-in-row-with-eu-over-proposed-office-in-belfast-brexit\">implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol</a> in the withdrawal agreement, which was designed to avoid a border on the island of Ireland.</p> <p>The protocol requires checks on goods passing from Britain to Northern Ireland. \u201cYou need to have customs checks on goods arriving in Northern Ireland, veterinary controls, a VAT system needs to be put in place\u201d, said an EU official.</p> <p>The two sides are expected to have a stock check on 30 April at the next meeting of the joint committee, the body established to ensure implementation of the provisions in the withdrawal agreement.</p> <p>Frost has ruled out an extension of the transition period. The UK believes there is ample time to agree and ratify a free-trade deal if the EU changes its position.</p>",

The warning came as the academic developing the app admitted that 60% of population would need to sign up to the app to make it effective. </p> \n  <p>Clare Collier, advocacy director at Liberty, said: \u201cBy presenting surveillance tools as a solution to lockdown, the government is drawing on the willingness we have all shown to make sacrifices in the face of this crisis while refusing to show it is taking seriously the enormous risks presented by invasive technology.</p> \n  <p>She added: \u201cContact-tracing technology may require us to sacrifice deeply sensitive personal information and there can be no question of state bodies or private companies sharing our personal data other than what is absolutely necessary. It is vital no-one is coerced into having the app installed, and using it as a condition for returning to work or everyday life will inevitably lead to discrimination.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe opportunities presented by technology should be fully investigated, but seeking quick solutions in surveillance tools that rely on our personal data creates serious long-term threats to our rights and ways of life. The government needs to focus on providing a public health response that ensures we come through this crisis with our rights intact.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Prof Christophe Fraser of the University of Oxford, who is leading a team developing the app, said that it would a require a very high take-up to be effective. </p> \n  <p>\u201cFor this intervention alone to stop a resurgence of the epidemic, about 60% of the population would have to use the app,\u201d he told the BBC. </p> \n  <p>He added: \u201cThe app is going to be one of the building blocks of how to get out of the epidemic. For every one to two users who download the app, and who adhere to the instructions, you will prevent one infection.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He explained if you become infected the app will send warning messages to anyone you have who has come within Bluetooth range of your phone.

  "<p>Doctors have postponed more than 2m operations after non-emergency surgery was cancelled for at least three months to free up beds for coronavirus patients.</p> <p>The mounting backlog of procedures could cost the NHS \u00a33bn to work through and may require many of the 20,000 doctors and nurses who have returned to the health service to stay on once the Covid-19 crisis has been brought under control.</p> <p>According to NHS England, postponing the planned operations, which typically cost \u00a31bn per month, has released 12,000 beds for patients who have fallen ill after contracting the virus.</p> <p>\u201cWe are probably only delivering around on- third of our usual surgical activity and that\u2019s nearly all for emergency and very urgent surgery. In the short term, we have to do a really major catch-up exercise to stop this backlog causing harm,\u201d Prof Derek Alderson, the president of the Royal College of Surgeons in England, told the Sunday People.</p> <p>Operations for hip and knee replacements, cataracts and hernias have all been delayed to make beds available to cope with coronavirus cases. Outpatient procedures are also on hold.</p> <p>The disruption to operations will have consequences for scores of patients, ranging from those with cancer, whose tumours may grow while they are waiting for surgery, to those who are less able to exercise and become unfit in the run-up to physically demanding operations.</p> <p>\u201cThe consequences are really serious,\u201d Alderson said. \u201cThere are some patients who have cancers that are usually slow-growing but this may impact on long-term survival. A patient\u2019s condition may deteriorate so they are no longer fit for the operation. Someone may be waiting for a hip replacement and may not be able to exercise and become even less fit for surgery. They may become addicted to opiates to manage their pain. Then there are all the mental health consequences.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The warning follows concerns raised by Cancer Research UK that the number of patients with suspected cancer who are being referred to hospital specialists has fallen dramatically. The charity believes more than 2,000 cancers are being missed each week and that many will become inoperable if they remain undetected. As estimated 400 cancers a week are being missed because normal screening programmes for breast, cervical and bowel cancer have been suspended.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/coronavirus-crisis-is-stopping-vital-cancer-care-doctors-say\">Coronavirus crisis is 'stopping vital cancer care' in England</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An NHS spokesperson said: \u201cWhile NHS staff have pulled out all the stops to manage coronavirus cases, they have continued to work hard to ensure patients can safely access services.</p> <p>\u201cNext week we will set out new guidance on redeploying some of the treatment capacity that was created while the number of Covid-19 patients rose sharply.

  "<p>Stone upon stone, the towering embodiment of their builders\u2019 wealth, status or hunger for defence, Scotland\u2019s iron-age brochs have fascinated and confounded archaeologists for centuries.</p> <p>The precise constitution of these architecturally complex roundhouses, and why they remain unique to Scotland, is the subject of ongoing research, but there is broad agreement that a broch is a drystone tower built between around 2,500 and 1,800 years ago, in the mid-iron age, often with cells and stairs built within the walls.</p> <p>According to Historic Environment Scotland (HES), between 500 and 600 have been identified using this definition, scattered across the country but with the densest distribution in Orkney, Shetland, and Caithness.</p> <p>On the Caithness coastline, north-east of Helmsdale, conservation work on the broch at Ousdale \u2013 now among the best preserved in the country and one of the few with evidence of a second floor \u2013 was weeks away from completion when it was abruptly halted by the lockdown.</p> <p>With fresh gravel flooring ready to lay when restrictions allow, the Caithness Broch Project, which coordinated the \u00a3180,000 Ousdale preservation, will then be ready to proceed with its flagship experiment: building a new broch from the ground up for the first time in the modern age, with the aim of understanding through construction how these structures developed and what they signified to the people who built them.</p> <p>\u201cExperimental archaeology is a more practical and innovative way of dealing with the difficult questions posed by these enigmatic constructions,\u201d explains Kenneth McElroy, the director of the Caithness Broch Project. \u201cIn turn, this helps us to better understand peoples of Scotland, and what drove them to build such impressive constructions.\u201d</p> <p>A handful of the most impressive brochs \u2013 Gurness, dominating the shoreline of Eynhallow Sound in Orkney, or the 13-metre Mousa broch in Shetland, which features in two Norse sagas \u2013 are open to the public. Many are cared for by HES or local authorities, but still more are lost beneath grassy tors, evidenced only by a few protruding stones.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bec07ad3ed5c34105a2a8c46a4fdb37625aaa6ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bec07ad3ed5c34105a2a8c46a4fdb37625aaa6ec/0_46_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Midhowe broch on the island of Rousay\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Midhowe broch on the island of Rousay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Sargent/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dr John Raven, the deputy head of casework at HES, suggests that a series of factors combined to create the context for the development of brochs. \u201cIn the background is a social crisis throughout north-western Europe in the mid-iron age which resulted the creation of hierarchies who sought to express their status and ownership by building complex structures. This was also a period of climate change which resulted in a significant expansion of peat growth in north and west Scotland, which limited the extent of good agricultural land and placed pressure on communities.</p> <p>\u201cIt is also possible that communities were reacting to slave trading with communities to the south and later the knock-on effects of the expansion of Rome. The structural complexity of brochs also suggests the development of specialised building techniques which largely limited the spread to inter-connected communities.\u201d</p> <p>As well as a thrilling exercise in experimental archaeology, the construction of a new broch will preserve and promote the skills of drystone dyking, says McElroy. He is working with a firm of architects to identify a suitable site for the project before fundraising stars in earnest. Crucially, he adds, the newbuild broch could serve as a world-class tourist attraction to draw visitors to Caithness, an area often bypassed on the way to more familiar island destinations.</p> <p>McElroy says: \u201cThere are so many unanswerable questions in archaeology, and in the past, but this should go some way to revealing more about our iron-age ancestors.\u201d</p>",

However, there are already significant exceptions.</p> \n<p>During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, cases involving paramilitaries were heard without a jury for fear of jury intimidation. Judges would hear evidence then sum up as though addressing a jury before delivering a verdict.</p> \n<p>In 2007, Diplock courts, as they were known, were abolished <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/aug/12/uk.northernireland\">except where Northern Ireland\u2019s director of public prosecutions certifies</a> the administration of justice might be impaired by a jury trial.

  "<p>Jury trials for serious crimes have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/mar/23/jury-trials-put-on-hold-in-england-and-wales-coronavirus\">come to a halt</a>.

That would get courts back up and running, even if barristers and judges have to argue through their face masks, and it would be a boon to defendants with good cases who do not want justice delayed.</p> <p>It is, of course, an Englishperson\u2019s enduring right not to be sent to prison for more than a year without the option of having his or her guilt determined by a jury of peers. But the right to jury trial was left out of the Human Rights Act, which merely adopted the European convention. Juries, as we know them, are not available in most continental countries, where first instance judges do an acceptable job of detailing rational reasons for findings of guilt that can then be scrutinised on appeal. There are cases in the UK where justice would be better served, and defendants would be better off, if they could choose trial by judge alone.</p> <p>Trial by judge alone operates in all international criminal courts and was introduced in Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles by the judge-only Diplock courts. There were civil liberty concerns at first but the Northern Ireland judges were generally astute and rejected some high profile RUC prosecutions. There is a rarely used power for prosecutors to apply for trial by judge alone, but only if they can show that the defendant is bent on jury tampering.</p> <p>Cases where defendants may prefer trial by judge alone are those where the prosecution does not have the evidence to exclude a reasonable doubt, and trial by judge would predictably produce a speedy acquittal. This could also be preferable in cases involving defendants demonised either in person or because of their racial or religious group. When I defended Irish terrorist suspects and black activists in earlier days, juror prejudice was inevitable due to oppressive police security arrangements in court precincts and sensational media coverage, and it resulted in some notoriously wrongful convictions. In such cases, a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial would have been more secure had they been entitled to opt for trial by judge alone.</p> <p>The most powerful argument against this was encapsulated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/nov/13/lord-hutchinson-of-lullington-obituary\">Lord Hutchinson</a>\u2019s response to my proposal: \u201cIt sounds fine in principle, but it will be the thin end of the wedge.\u201d He was afraid, like many great criminal lawyers, that it would be the first step to abolishing a trial system that they knew instinctively was worth keeping. They thought it vulnerable to politicians\u2019 attraction to cheaper, speedier and more rational justice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/19/uk-courts-told-not-to-overreact-during-coronavirus-crisis\">UK courts told not to 'overreact' during coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But provision of a jury waiver option will not lead to the demise of a form of trial that has so much public acceptance, in particular because it involves the public in the delivery of justice.

These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations.</p>\n    <p>The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers.</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The reports come after the National Police Chiefs Council and the National College of Policing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/driving-for-exercise-allowed-under-lockdown-rules-police-advised-coronavirus\">issued new advice earlier in the month clarifying that driving to the countryside for walks</a> \u2013 where more time is spent walking than travelling \u2013 is among a list of reasonable excuses for people leaving their home during the coronavirus lockdown.

  "<p>For most of the past 20 years, gymnastics is the only thing that Kyla Ross has known. She was doing handstands by four years old, she was an Olympic gold medallist by 15 and this year at 23 she was finishing an exceptional college gymnastics career at UCLA. This was supposed to be the season that tied all the loose ends as she achieved her final goals and then departed into the night. Instead, Ross watched helplessly as the coronavirus outbreak had the final say, briskly sending her into retirement.</p> <p>For a full week in mid-March, each new day brought one more blow in a series of gut punches for college athletes. First they learned that their meets would be audience-free, then the Pac-12 national competition was scuppered, then the entire season was cancelled. By 12 March, universities were closing down.

She also happens to be one of the best gymnasts of the past decade.

As the entire 2012 Olympic team stepped forward against Larry Nassar, the toxic culture of Marta Karolyi\u2019s camps was revealed. However, college is often different. The gymnasts are hellbent on pairing fierce competition with enjoyment, friendship and an enriching culture.

  "<p>For almost six years now, a network of volunteers in Europe and Africa have been providing a service that some of the world\u2019s wealthiest countries have chosen not to. When migrants get into distress in the Mediterranean, they can call <a href=\"https://alarmphone.org/en/\">Alarm Phone</a>\u2019s emergency number; the call is relayed by a team of people spread across France, Tunisia, Italy, Germany, the UK, Morocco and elsewhere to the coastguard service nearest the boat.</p> <p>On the night of 10 April, Alarm Phone received a call from one of 63 people on board a rubber boat drifting between Libya, Italy and Malta that was slowly filling up with water.<a href=\"https://alarmphone.org/en/2020/04/16/twelve-deaths-and-a-secret-push-back-to-libya/\"> According to Alarm Phone</a>, the EU was aware of the boat but Malta, the country that should have been responsible for rescuing it, held off until the migrants could be returned to Libya, where torture and other forms of mistreatment are well documented. The boat drifted for five days, during which time five people died of thirst, according to survivors, and another seven people went missing, presumed drowned.</p> <p>Malta\u2019s prime minister, Robert Abela, is now<a href=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/malta-prime-minister-migrant-deaths-5078016-Apr2020/\"> under police investigation</a> for the incident but remains defiant: \u201cMy conscience is clear because we have done everything in our power to protect our people and all those who live in this country,\u201d he said, explaining that Malta\u2019s ports were closed during the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cIn a health emergency, this country is not a safe port for migrants.\u201d</p> <p>To many people, this logic \u2013 we must look after our own \u2013 will seem unassailable, despite the costs. Malta is not the only country to shut off help to vulnerable migrants during the pandemic: Italy has also<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/italy-declares-own-ports-unsafe-to-stop-migrants-disembarking\"> closed its ports</a>, while the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/patel-refuses-to-take-children-from-greek-camps-threatened-by-covid-19\">declines to evacuate</a> refugee children with relatives in Britain from unsanitary Greek camps, and the US has <a href=\"https://apnews.com/7e9426532434bdda47f270a57d091c91\">quietly suspended</a> its entire asylum system. Earlier this month, nearly 400 Rohingya refugees were found starving on a boat near Malaysia, which had reportedly <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-52305931\">cited the pandemic</a> as a reason not to take them in.</p> <p>Temporary limits on movement \u2013 within countries and cities, as well as internationally \u2013 are regarded by most public health experts as an essential part of the fight against the coronavirus. But the overriding message from leading scientists has been that this needs to be based on a system of testing and contact tracing that tracks the spread of the virus, rather than blanket assumptions about foreigners and other outsiders. If clampdowns on national borders are offered as a substitute for more meaningful forms of protection then everybody loses.</p> <p>In recent years, as rightwing populism has become a defining political force in many parts of the world, the demand for tougher border control has come to stand in for a range of wider anxieties about identity, culture and economic security. The political theorist Wendy Brown links this to decades of neoliberal policies that have allowed finance-driven global capitalism to undermine wages, infrastructure and social security in wealthy countries; her book<a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/walled-states-waning-sovereignty\"> Walled States, Waning Sovereignty</a> suggests that the politically potent image of the border wall has come to stand in for security that the state no longer provides.</p> <p>Nowhere does this seem more apt today than the US. Universal healthcare and comprehensive unemployment support is anathema to much of the political elite; what they have instead is a president who grandstands about flight bans and protecting Americans<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/21/trump-us-immigration-ban-pause-green-cards\"> from being \u201creplaced\u201d</a> in their jobs by immigrants even as he actively undermines domestic social distancing policies and efforts to source vital medical equipment. But the impulse is present in Europe too: as the coronavirus arrived on the continent the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/28/coronavirus-outbreak-migrants-blamed-italy-matteo-salvini-marine-le-pen\"> first response of many rightwing populists</a> was to attack refugee policy and the EU\u2019s internal free movement rules. Some of these voices<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/01/populist-right-coronavirus\"> have, for the moment, been dimmed</a> as many citizens prioritise the advice of scientific experts in a time of medical emergency.</p> <p>If the border is a dominant symbol of national welfare, it is not the only one. In the UK, while a vocal minority on the right<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/30/course-must-stop-coronavirus-not-cost-becoming-police-state/\"> continues to play on this theme</a> in order to attack domestic lockdown measures, it has been eclipsed by the call to rally around the NHS. There is no more powerful symbol of collective good in the British political lexicon; not even politicians who oppose the principle of socialised medicine dare say so openly. It sits at the heart of the government\u2019s call to action: <em>stay home, protect the NHS, save lives</em>.</p> <p>The solidarity expressed by millions of people at a moment of crisis is an amazing thing. As in other afflicted countries, the vast majority of the UK\u2019s population have made huge, largely voluntary changes to their lives for collective benefit. But our desire for security can nonetheless be pushed in an exclusionary direction. \u201cIt\u2019s the national health service, not the international health service,\u201d<a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthancock/status/1195997609942560768\"> wrote</a> the health secretary Matt Hancock during last year\u2019s general election campaign, promising to extend the health surcharge to non-resident EU citizens after Brexit.</p> <p>Over the past decade, as the strength of the NHS has been depleted by austerity economics, along with other public services, the right has pushed the claim that foreigners are an unacceptable drain on the state, accompanied by a host of bureaucratic measures \u2013 charges, restrictions, surveillance, punishment \u2013 to police their activities even as the rest of society benefits from their labour. It is no small irony that as Britain expresses a newfound gratitude to the immigrants that help keep the NHS and other key services running, the Home Office is<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MayaGoodfellow/status/1252550524790018048\"> fighting to maintain</a> many of its notorious hostile environment policies.</p> <p>Once the pandemic subsides, and we are left to deal with the social and economic upheaval in its wake, nationalist demands for wealthy countries to turn inwards are likely to intensify. These may well start with demands to exclude outsiders but they are likely to turn on \u201cundeserving\u201d citizens too. Events in the Mediterranean may seem distant from many everyday concerns right now, but the way our governments treat people in need is the defining question of our time. If you want to see what happens when death and suffering are swept under the carpet and rendered acceptable by political euphemism and omission, then the frontiers of the rich world are a useful place to start. This is a planetary crisis, not a national one, and it is vital that we do not allow our respect for human life to end at the border.</p> <p>\u2022 Daniel Trilling is the author of Lights in the Distance: Exile and Refuge at the Borders of Europe</p>",
  "<p>Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1986 wisecrack \u2013 \u201cThe nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I\u2019m from the government and I\u2019m here to help\u201d \u2013 would not get a lot of laughs today. In much of the world, people are desperate for the government to show up and rise to the challenge of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Reagan\u2019s attitude to government solidified into orthodoxy for more than three decades, spreading abroad \u2013 particularly in the UK with the help of Margaret Thatcher \u2013 and captured the centre ground of politics in both countries.</p> <p>The antipathy to the state was selective: Reagan, like Donald Trump today, racked up huge deficits, spent heavily on defence and built up a system of corporate welfare through subsidies and tax breaks. But on both sides of the Atlantic, the prevailing wisdom was the state should wherever possible get out of the business of trying to control inequality and provide services to the less fortunate.</p> <p>There are already some signs that the Covid-19 shock may challenge those attitudes. Disease and mass unemployment have always been far better recruiting sergeants for the cause of big government than any party manifesto \u2013 and this crisis is unlikely to be an exception.</p> <p>Some social scientists and historians argue that this pandemic could become a turning point in social history \u2013 on a par with the New Deal in the US or the post-war Labour government in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been on this kind of trajectory for last 30-odd years where the individual was taking priority over the collective.

The less a government does for its people, the more it has to control them.</p> <p>In the US, the Trump administration is likely to face resistance if it seeks to withdraw forms of social support that have long been standard in most western democracies.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole pandemic, I think, has laid bare all of the inadequacies of the US social safety net,\u201d John Schmitt, the vice-president of the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, said. \u201cA very basic thing every other advanced economy in the world guarantees workers is at least a minimum amount of paid sick days. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/19/coronavirus-crisis-paid-sick-leave-is-a-start-to-our-collective-security-as-a-nation\">The US does not have at the national level any laws like that</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to imagine that there won\u2019t be significant support when the dust settles for state, local and federal legislation to address that incredibly longstanding policy failure,\u201d he said.</p> <p>There are two other areas where Schmitt predicted there would be strong demand for lasting change.

As a far broader cross-section of Americans face medical bankruptcy because they have partial or no health insurance, it will be harder for Trump to pursue his effort to obliterate the Obama administration\u2019s Affordable Care Act, which extended the scope of health insurance coverage, and could provide support for a more ambitious expansion of government-funded healthcare.</p> <p>For parallel reasons, it will be even harder politically for Boris Johnson to bargain away the fundamentals of the NHS at trade talks with Washington, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/12/boris-johnson-leaves-hospital-as-he-continues-recovery-from-coronavirus\">after it saved his life</a>.</p> <p>It is too early to predict how the coronavirus shock will affect the outcome of this year\u2019s US elections. All other things being equal, greater popularity for a government-funded social safety net should translate into more votes for Democrats, who have traditionally championed such policies. But Trump will seek to take that ground, insisting, for example, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/15/donald-trumps-name-to-be-printed-on-covid-19-stimulus-cheques-report\">his name is on the $600 cheques the federal government is sending out each week</a> to supplement unemployment benefit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63309317c87499a8631daf38c29b826db48fd4cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63309317c87499a8631daf38c29b826db48fd4cb/0_160_4810_2886/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump signs the coronavirus stimulus relief package in the Oval Office.

In such circumstances, formerly unthinkable solutions become more palatable.</p> <p>\u201cPeople use the analogy of the financial crisis but I think it\u2019s the wrong one. War is a much better one because it is both a supply and a demand shock,\u201d said Branko Milanovic, an economist at the City University of New York, adding that a prolonged economic downturn would lead to \u201ca reassessment of the role of the state\u201d.</p> <p>Milanovic cautioned, however, that it was also quite possible that a groundswell of support for a universal healthcare system and a much more robust social safety net might not be reflected in the US political system. He said: \u201cWhat we would actually face in the US is an ever-increasing discrepancy between the demand for change, and the total absence of change.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Civil liberties campaigners are concerned that the public could be \u201ccoerced\u201d into sharing data about their movements through a coronavirus contact-tracing app being developed by the UK government.</p> <p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, says the app, which will be available within weeks, is \u201ccrucial for holding down the rate and the level of transmission\u201d of Covid-19.</p> <p>But the campaign group Liberty is worried that signing up to the app could become a compulsory condition for returning to work and being allowed out of lockdown when conditions are eased. Such a condition would amount to coercion, Liberty claims.</p> <p>The academic developing the app has said that tens of millions of people would need to sign up to the app to make it effective.</p> <p>Clare Collier, the advocacy director at Liberty, said: \u201cBy presenting surveillance tools as a solution to lockdown, the government is drawing on the willingness we have all shown to make sacrifices in the face of this crisis while refusing to show it is taking seriously the enormous risks presented by invasive technology.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cContact-tracing technology may require us to sacrifice deeply sensitive personal information and there can be no question of state bodies or private companies sharing our personal data other than what is absolutely necessary. It is vital no one is coerced into having the app installed, and using it as a condition for returning to work or everyday life will inevitably lead to discrimination.</p> <p>\u201cThe opportunities presented by technology should be fully investigated, but seeking quick solutions in surveillance tools that rely on our personal data creates serious long-term threats to our rights and ways of life.</p> <p>\u201cContact-tracing technology will only work if 60% of people use it. But people will only use it if they trust their rights are being protected. For this approach to have any hope of helping us beat the virus, privacy safeguards must be hard-wired into the design from the outset.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Christophe Fraser, of the University of Oxford, who is leading a team developing the app, said it would a require a very high take-up to be effective.</p> <p>\u201cFor this intervention alone to stop a resurgence of the epidemic, about 60% of the population would have to use the app,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cThe app is going to be one of the building blocks of how to get out of the epidemic. For every one to two users who download the app and who adhere to the instructions, you will prevent one infection.\u201d</p> <p>He that if a person became infected, the app would send warning messages to anyone who had come within Bluetooth range of their phone. He said: \u201cYou\u2019ll either get a message which says you\u2019ve been in contact with a suspected case of Covid-19. Or you may later get a message and you\u2019ve been a contact of a confirmed case. At that point, we would recommend quarantine of 14 days after the contact has taken place.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>He added: \u201cWhen you install the app, this is an opt-in system so it will work in the background. Your phone builds up a memory of the sort of anonymous IDs of the other phones you come into contact with. It needs to be a contact long enough that there\u2019s a risk of transmission.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about privacy concerns he said: \u201cThe NHS records patient data already and we trust the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">NHS</a> to look after private data. This is being developed with a minimal amount of data \u2013 enough to make it work. It\u2019s a public health intervention with data collected within a health system.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Christian Drosten, who directs the Institute of Virology at the Charit\u00e9 Hospital in Berlin, was one of those who identified the Sars virus in 2003. As the head of the German public health institute\u2019s reference lab on coronaviruses, he has become the government\u2019s go-to expert on the related virus causing the current pandemic.</p> \n<p>In an exclusive interview, Drosten admits he fears a second deadly wave of the virus. He explains why Angela Merkel has an advantage over other world leaders \u2013 and why the \u201cprevention paradox\u201d keeps him awake at night.</p> \n<p><strong>Q: Germany will start</strong><strong> to lift its lockdown gradually from Monday. What happens next?<br>A: </strong>At the moment, we are seeing half-empty ICUs in Germany. This is because we started diagnostics early and on a broad scale, and we stopped the epidemic \u2013 that is, we brought the reproduction number [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/apr/22/see-how-coronavirus-can-spread-through-a-population-and-how-countries-flatten-the-curve\">a key measure of the spread of the virus</a>] below 1. Now, what I call the \u201cprevention paradox\u201d has set in. People are claiming we over-reacted, there is political and economic pressure to return to normal. The federal plan is to lift lockdown slightly, but because the German states, or L\u00e4nder, set their own rules, I fear we\u2019re going to see a lot of creativity in the interpretation of that plan. I worry that the reproduction number will start to climb again, and we will have a second wave.</p> \n<p><strong>Q: If the lockdown were kept in place longer, could the disease be eradicated?<br>A:</strong> There is a group of modellers in Germany who suggest that by prolonging lockdown here for another few weeks, we could really suppress virus circulation to a considerable degree \u2013 bringing the reproduction number below 0.2. I tend to support them but I haven\u2019t completely made up my mind. The reproduction number is just an average, an indication. It doesn\u2019t tell you about pockets of high prevalence such as senior citizens\u2019 homes, where it will take longer to eradicate the disease, and from where we could see a rapid resurgence even if lockdown were extended.</p> \n<p><strong>Q: If there were such a resurgence, could it be contained?<br>A:</strong> Yes, but it can\u2019t happen based on human contact-tracing alone. We now have evidence that almost half of infection events happen before the person passing on the infection develops symptoms \u2013 and people are infectious starting two days prior to that. That means that human contact-tracers working with patients to identify those they\u2019ve been exposed to are in a race against time. They need help to catch all those potentially exposed as quickly as possible \u2013 and that will require electronic contact-tracing.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Germany\" data-alt=\"Coronavirus in Germany\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Germany\">Coronavirus in Germany</a> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Q: How close we are to achieving herd immunity?<br>A:</strong> To achieve herd immunity we need 60-70% of the population to carry antibodies to the virus. The results of antibody tests suggest that in Europe and the US, in general, we are in the low single digits, but the tests are not reliable \u2013 all of them have problems with false positives \u2013 and herd immunity is also not the whole story. It assumes complete mixing of the population, but there are reasons \u2013 in part to do with the social networks people form \u2013 why the whole population may not be available for infection at any given time. Networks shift, and new people are exposed to the virus. Such effects can drive waves of infection. Another factor that could impact herd immunity is whether other coronaviruses \u2013 those that cause the common cold, for example \u2013 offer protection to this one. We don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s possible.</p> \n<p><strong>Q: Should all countries be testing everybody?<br>A:</strong> I\u2019m not sure. Even in Germany, with our huge testing capacity, and most of it directed to people reporting symptoms, we have not had a positivity rate above 8%. So I think targeted testing might be best, for people who are really vulnerable \u2013 staff in hospitals and care homes, for example. This is not fully in place even in Germany, though we\u2019re moving towards it. The other target should be patients in the first week of symptoms, especially elderly patients who tend to come to hospital too late at the moment \u2013 when their lips are already blue and they need intubation. And we need some kind of sentinel surveillance system, to sample the population regularly and follow the development of the reproduction number.</p> \n<p><strong>Q: What is known about the seasonality of the virus?<br>A:</strong> Not a lot. The Harvard modelling group led by Marc Lipsitch has suggested that transmission might slow over the summer, but that it will be a small effect. I don\u2019t have better data.</p> \n<p><strong>Q: Can we say for sure that the pandemic started in China?<br></strong>I think so. On the other hand, I don\u2019t assume that it started at the food market in Wuhan. It is more likely to have started where the animal \u2013 the intermediate host \u2013 was bred.</p> \n<p><strong>Q: What do we know about that intermediate host \u2013 is it the \u201cpoor pangolin\u201d, as it\u2019s come to be known?<br>A:</strong> I don\u2019t see any reason to assume that the virus passed through pangolins on its way to humans. There is an interesting piece of information from the old Sars literature. That virus was found in civet cats, but also in raccoon dogs \u2013 something the media overlooked. Raccoon dogs are a massive industry in China, where they are bred on farms and caught in the wild for their fur. If somebody gave me a few hundred thousand bucks and free access to China to find the source of the virus, I would look in places where raccoon dogs are bred.</p> \n<p><strong>Q: Will it be useful to identify patient zero \u2013 the first human to have been infected with this virus?<br>A</strong>: No. Patient zero is almost certain to have acquired a virus that is very similar to some of the first sequenced viruses, so it wouldn\u2019t help us solve our current problem. I don\u2019t think you could even argue that it would help us prevent future coronavirus pandemics, because humanity will be immune to the next Sars-related coronavirus, having been exposed to this one. Other coronaviruses could pose a threat \u2013 a prime candidate is the Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) virus \u2013 but to understand that threat we have to study how Mers viruses are evolving in camels in the Middle East.</p> \n<p><strong>Q: Are human activities responsible for the spillover of coronaviruses from animals into people?<br></strong>Coronaviruses are prone to switch hosts when there is opportunity, and we create such opportunities through our non-natural use of animals \u2013 livestock. Livestock animals are exposed to wildlife, they are kept in large groups that can amplify the virus, and humans have intense contact with them \u2013 for example through the consumption of meat \u2013 so they certainly represent a possible trajectory of emergence for coronaviruses. Camels count as livestock in the Middle East, and they are the host of the Mers virus as well as human coronavirus 229E \u2013 which is one cause of the common cold \u2013 while cattle were the original hosts for coronavirus OC43, which is another.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Q: Flu has always been thought to pose the greatest pandemic risk. Is that still the case?<br>A:</strong> Certainly, but we can\u2019t rule out another coronavirus pandemic. After the first Ebola outbreak, in 1976, people thought it would never come back again, but it took less than 20 years to do so.</p> \n<p><strong>Q: Is all the science being done around this coronavirus good science?<br>A:</strong> No! Early on, in February, there were many interesting preprints [scientific papers that have not yet been peer-reviewed] around. Now you can read through 50 before you find something that\u2019s actually solid and interesting. A lot of research resources are being wasted.</p> \n<p><strong>Q: Angela Merkel has been praised for her leadership during this crisis. What makes her a good leader?<br></strong>She\u2019s extremely well-informed. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/angela-merkel-draws-on-science-background-in-covid-19-explainer-lockdown-exit\">It helps that she\u2019s a scientist</a> and can handle numbers. But I think it mainly comes down to her character \u2013 her thoughtfulness and ability to reassure. Maybe one of the distinguishing features of a good leader is that they are not using this present situation as a political opportunity. They know how counterproductive that would be.</p> \n<p><strong>Q: From where you stand, how is the UK handling the situation?<br>A:</strong> It\u2019s clear that testing was implemented a little bit too late in the UK. Public Health England was in a position to diagnose the disease very early on \u2013 we worked with them to make the diagnostic test \u2013 but rollout in Germany was driven in part by market forces, which made it fast, and that wasn\u2019t the case in the UK. Now, though, I have the impression that the UK is really gaining momentum in this regard, and that it is coordinating testing efforts better than Germany.</p> \n<p><strong>Q: What keeps you awake at night?<br>A:</strong> In Germany, people see that the hospitals are not overwhelmed, and they don\u2019t understand why their shops have to shut. They only look at what\u2019s happening here, not at the situation in, say, New York or Spain. This is the prevention paradox, and for many Germans I\u2019m the evil guy who is crippling the economy. I get death threats, which I pass on to the police. More worrying to me are the other emails, the ones from people who say they have three kids and they\u2019re worried about the future. It\u2019s not my fault, but those ones keep me awake at night.</p>",

Many will try to leave the country, while those who do not have that chance will face daily humiliations.</p> <p>\u201cIn Hungary, you need to show your ID to rent a bike, buy a bus pass or to pick up a package at the post office. It basically means coming out as trans to complete strangers, all the time. The good version is they are nice about it, but there are situations where people turn quite hostile,\u201d said Ivett \u00d6rd\u00f6g, a 39-year-old trans woman living in Budapest.</p> <p>Hungary\u2019s anti-immigration prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has prompted a wave of international criticism during the coronavirus pandemic by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\">adopting legislation that allows him to rule by decree</a> indefinitely. Parliament is still sitting, but instead of focusing on fighting coronavirus, it is dealing with issues such as the new trans legislation.</p> <p>Bernadett Sz\u00e9l, an independent MP who has opposed the law in parliament\u2019s judicial committee, described it as \u201cevil\u201d and \u201ca step back in time\u201d. During a hearing in the committee, she tried to read out a letter from trans people explaining how harmful the law would be for them, but was shut down by the committee\u2019s chair, who described the letter as \u201cnot relevant\u201d.</p> <p>Sz\u00e9l also criticised the timing of the bill. \u201cWe have a pandemic going on and all of us should be focusing on two things: healthcare issues and helping people financially to secure their wellbeing. What is happening in Hungary is a scandal,\u201d she said. It is not clear when the bill will be put to a vote, but observers say its passage through committees suggests the government is pushing ahead with it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a0817d9fc5f220550ecb35fcd3f99f8ff0b43f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a0817d9fc5f220550ecb35fcd3f99f8ff0b43f0/0_345_2942_1764/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernadett Sz\u00e9l\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernadett Sz\u00e9l: \u2018What is happening in Hungary is a scandal.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zolt\u00e1n Balogh/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The law also opens up the possibility that it could target people who have already made a legal change and now live with a gender that does not match their \u201csex at birth\u201d, the planned new gender category on official documents.</p> <p>\u201cWe think it\u2019s likely that they don\u2019t plan to go after people who already changed, but we just don\u2019t know,\u201d said Tam\u00e1s Dombos, a board member of the H\u00e1tt\u00e9r Society, a Hungarian organisation focused on LGBTQI rights.</p> <p>Legal experts say the new law will be in violation of European human rights case law, leaving it open to challenge in both the Hungarian supreme court and the European court of human rights (ECHR).</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s very clear case law on this in the ECHR, so it\u2019s very likely it will be challenged soon after it\u2019s implemented. But the court takes years, and the decisions are always individual. People will probably get compensation but it won\u2019t mean they get new documents,\u201d said Dombos.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/25/anti-lgbt-rhetoric-stokes-tensions-in-eastern-europe\">Anti-LGBT rhetoric stokes tensions in eastern Europe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Until 2016, the procedure for legally changing gender in Hungary was fairly straightforward, said Dombos, but for the past three years, authorities have been reluctant to implement the law, meaning there is a backlog of people waiting for decisions on their applications for gender changes. \u201cMy request has been sitting there for a year, and this new law will mean it will be fully rejected,\u201d said \u00d6rd\u00f6g.</p> <p>Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government has become more hostile towards the LGBTQ+ community in the past two years, moving from generic language about traditional values and the benefits of heterosexual marriage to openly discriminatory language, such as comparing homosexuality to paedophilia.</p> <p>\u201cThis kind of language was not present before, and now it is no longer just discourse, it\u2019s going to become policy,\u201d said Dombos.</p> <p>Although it will still be possible for people to change their names, in Hungary there is an official register of allowed names compiled by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and this list is gendered. There are no names approved for both genders. \u201cI cannot change my legal name to anything that doesn\u2019t give me away as a trans person,\u201d said \u00d6rd\u00f6g.</p> <p>Even without the new law, life for trans people in Hungary is filled with obstacles. Amanda Malovics, a 30-year-old trans woman, left Hungary in 2015 for London, with one suitcase and enough money to last a month, she said, as she felt uncomfortable starting her transition in Hungary.</p> <p>In Britain she has changed her name by deed poll, which means that bank accounts, bills and the rest of her life in London can be conducted under her new name. As soon as she needs to travel, however, she is faced with using her Hungarian passport with her old name and gender. She applied to change her gender in Hungary last year but, like others, has had the application stalled.</p> <p>\u201cI live and breathe as a woman, I look like a woman, I am present in myself as a woman and I identify as a woman, but my ID says otherwise. I absolutely hate travelling, because of this. There\u2019s massive fear and anxiety every time,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Now, she says, she is waiting until she qualifies for UK citizenship to receive a passport in her new name, and at that point will consider making the difficult decision to revoke her Hungarian citizenship. She believes many other Hungarian trans people will also leave.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s pointless for me to belong somewhere where I\u2019m not wanted or welcome,\u201d she said.</p>",

  "<p>Midnight in Tokyo. I\u2019m standing in a narrow alleyway behind one of the hostess clubs in the capital\u2019s red-light district. A large screen displays live updates of the gender balance inside, currently: ladies 113, men 87. Just around the corner is a famous hangout of the yakuza gangs, where a few months earlier there was a bloody shootout and a Korean crime boss was killed.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.dynamomagician.com/\" title=\"\">Dynamo</a>, one of the world\u2019s most successful magicians, is used to performing in edgy atmospheres: he\u2019s done street magic for gang members in LA\u2019s Compton, and illicit tricks in Saudi Arabia where magic and the supernatural are banned and punishable by 40 lashes. But Tokyo is the one he\u2019s always dreamed of, especially after he saw <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/jun/18/actionandadventure.drama\" title=\"\">Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift</a></em> in his 20s \u2013 a film that includes the immortal line: \u201cThe first drifters invented drifting out here in the mountains by feeling it. So feel it!\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019re not really in any danger. These days the area is frequented by tourists searching for a sanitised version of seedy and, besides, we\u2019re with a crowd of people 15 deep. But magic has always thrived on the impression of peril. The most popular early illusions involved sawing women in half or being shackled while submerged in water. More recently magicians, such as <a href=\"https://davidblaine.com/\" title=\"\">David Blaine,</a> have tried to push the human body to its limit. <a href=\"http://derrenbrown.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Derren Brown</a> has managed to raise the stakes further not just by appearing to endanger his own life, as he did when he played <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2003/oct/09/thisweekssciencequestions3\" title=\"\">Russian </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2003/oct/09/thisweekssciencequestions3\" title=\"\">roulette</a> on live TV, but those of his subjects. In his 2016 Netflix special<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jan/13/derren-brown-pushed-to-the-edge-review\" title=\"\"> Pushed to </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jan/13/derren-brown-pushed-to-the-edge-review\" title=\"\">the Edge</a></em> he appears to coerce a member of the public, who doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s being manipulated or filmed, into pushing someone off a roof to their apparent death.</p> <p>But, increasingly, the idea of making a spectacle out of death and misery seems out of step with our post-truth world. What does it mean, for example, to be able to guess what someone is thinking when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\" title=\"\">Cambridge Analytica</a> was able to make seemingly astonishing guesses about people\u2019s political persuasion, and facial recognition software can link millions of people to their private information? British science fiction writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/09/arthur-c-clarke-king-science-fiction\" title=\"\">Arthur C Clarke</a> famously wrote that \u201cany sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic\u201d, a statement normally considered to be about the wonder of scientific advancement \u2013 but it could also be about the redundancy of magicians.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e6046c81c490a7af8e023a159bcf133cd0f3232\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e6046c81c490a7af8e023a159bcf133cd0f3232/452_74_4819_2895/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dynamo holds back an accelerating car in Tokyo.

Techno-illusionist <a href=\"https://marcotempest.com/en/\" title=\"\">Marco Tempest</a>, a director\u2019s fellow at MIT\u2019s Media Lab, gives magic demonstrations to rapturous audiences of billionaires at places like Davos, using augmented reality and interactive projections in a bid to outpace technology. But the problem is that Tempest\u2019s demonstrations from even five years ago, when he made drones react to his movements or a robot perform simple sleight of hand, now look entirely unremarkable \u2013 already superseded by the automotive dystopias on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/BostonDynamics\" title=\"\">Boston Dynamics </a>YouTube channel.</p> <p>\u201cThe technology that comes out is so fascinating and moving at such a rapid pace that it\u2019s so hard to comprehend what is going to be out in the future,\u201d says Dynamo when I ask whether people are more amazed by human magicians or virtual achievements. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any piece of technology out there that is more advanced and can grow more than the human mind. The technology that\u2019s getting developed, it starts off as an idea in someone\u2019s head. And that\u2019s what magic is. It\u2019s taking something that just starts in your mind and bringing it to life.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, the magicians that seem to be doing best are those who have moved beyond the idea of illusion in these untrustworthy times. On <em><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80190510\" title=\"\">Magic for Humans</a></em> with Justin Willman, a big Netflix show, one of the most interesting tricks is explained in its entirety before it begins. Willman explains that he has hired an audience of stooges for a magic show in a park and then waits for one unsuspecting man to join them, who he picks \u201crandomly\u201d as a volunteer and says he\u2019s going to make him disappear. He doesn\u2019t do anything, just chucks a blanket over his head and pulls it off again, but the fake audience reacts as if he\u2019s gone, so he believes he has. The magic comes in watching a person \u2013 waving in people\u2019s faces and getting no reaction \u2013 believe they have truly become invisible.</p> <p>Even those that once made a living out of can-you-believe-it stunts are moving away from illusion. Brown\u2019s most recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/13/derren-brown-sacrifice\" title=\"\">Netflix special</a> was all about teaching a man who harboured racist views enough empathy to take a bullet for someone of Mexican descent, with Brown relying more on a combination of psychological techniques than showpiece stunts. The final five minutes involved no magic at all, instead letting a moral argument play out between two of his advisers about whether they had a responsibility to resign from the programme if Brown refused to take his own safety seriously. The question of these shows becomes not \u201cHow did he do it?\u201d but \u201cShould he do it?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9090d2974c72df835cd6140d5c52ba40f46ea86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9090d2974c72df835cd6140d5c52ba40f46ea86/0_188_1080_648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Streets ahead: Dynamo in a still from his new Beyond Belief series.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Streets ahead: Dynamo in a still from his new Beyond Belief series.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Inner Circle Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.gold.ac.uk/psychology/staff/kuhn/\" title=\"\">Gustav Kuhn</a>, a former magician turned psychology professor, has spearheaded examination of magic as a field of science. He\u2019s interested in the places magic, clinical psychology and the modern world overlap. In one recent study, for example, he got a \u201cmedium\u201d to claim they were talking to the dead relatives of an audience of undergraduate students. Using magical trickery, he was able to guess correctly some of the things the students were thinking.</p> <p>\u201cThe sheer number of people, and these are Goldsmiths undergraduates, who believe what they\u2019re seeing is true really shocked me. What\u2019s even more frightening is that even if you tell someone what they\u2019re seeing is a magician who is using deception, they still believe what they are seeing is true. It\u2019s alarming how easily people are led to believe things that are impossible.\u201d</p> <p>This, he says, has a big impact on the way we think about fake news. It\u2019s not merely enough to tell people it isn\u2019t real, to factcheck \u2013 people ignore that information. Only when we are told how a trick is done do we stop believing in it, as the Goldsmiths students eventually were.</p> <p>For Dynamo, the distorted dangers of magic and the jeopardy of real life have become inexorably linked. Just a few years ago it seemed he might never make it to Japan. Having suffered with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/oct/19/bad-gut-feelings-doctors-arent-spotting-crohns-disease\" title=\"\">Crohn\u2019s</a> disease his whole life, in 2014 a complication caused by a bout of food poisoning meant he was hospitalised for months with chronic pain and a series of worsening symptoms, including arthritis that affected every joint in his body and meant even some basic tasks, never mind sleight of hand, were impossible.</p> <p>While we\u2019re waiting for shooting to reset, he tells me that although he experienced \u201cthe worst pain ever\u201d during those months, he never lost focus on magic \u2013 coming up with more than 250 tricks and even learning Japanese from his hospital bed. When he was eventually discharged, he was followed home by paparazzi. He didn\u2019t want photos of him appearing unexplained, so he posted a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dynamomagician?lang=en\" title=\"\">video</a> outlining his condition. In it he looked unrecognisable, his face and body bloated and swollen, a result of the medication. But with the help of rehabilitation he was able to relearn the fundamentals of his craft. Now, at 37, he\u2019s finally made it to Japan. When he arrived a few days earlier, he was met by hundreds of screaming fans at the airport, a sign of his global appeal (he\u2019d just come off a 145-date <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/sep/27/dynamo-magician-next-trick-live-tour-interview\" title=\"\">live tour</a>, selling out arenas from Cardiff to Cape Town). Now he says he worries less about the damage trickery can do and thinks more about the hope it can inspire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78f9fd527e9e70fbaa032318786bfd637e3a9c2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78f9fd527e9e70fbaa032318786bfd637e3a9c2a/16_215_2487_1491/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Blaine crouching in a street and holding up playing cards.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kingmaker: David Blaine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Donna Svennevik/Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was raised in what he describes as \u201cquite a broken home\u201d. His father was in jail for most of his young life. He was close to his mother, but she was only 16 when she had him and was also trying to sort her own life out. He was raised by his grandparents and great- grandparents, but says he mostly spent a lot of time alone, on his Bradford council estate. Once he got to school, he was bullied relentlessly, in part because of his size, but also his father\u2019s Pakistani heritage. \u201cI was beaten up quite a bit, because I went to quite a racist school \u2013 being of mixed background, you know. My mum\u2019s English so a lot of people now wouldn\u2019t necessarily know, but it is kind of obvious. I got a real rough time.\u201d</p> <p>His grandfather\u2019s magic manuals and the comic books he used to collect provided an escape route, and he was drawn by the super-powers he found in them. At that age, the magic of fantasy fiction and the trickery of illusion were hard to distinguish. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a TV licence, but the local video store gave me a VHS player. So I used to watch everything. Back then I didn\u2019t comprehend the difference between a documentary and a movie. So I was watching these superhero movies, believing it was a real-life story. That gave me belief in myself, that I wanted to grow up and be like that when I was older. Before magic, I didn\u2019t know who I needed to be, who society wanted me to be as a person. I didn\u2019t totally feel comfortable being myself, because I didn\u2019t feel that I belonged into any particular group. I felt like an outsider.\u201d</p> <p>Dynamo agrees with Kuhn that magic can be powerful, and that power has to be wielded responsibly. But he sees his own belief in superhero-like powers changed his life, and he wants to create the same effect, especially for young working-class Brits who had an upbringing like his.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know what to believe, in this day and age. And whether people want to believe what I\u2019m doing is real magic or skill, it\u2019s totally up to them. But I want to inspire the kid who\u2019s living in Bradford now on a council estate and who feels there\u2019s no opportunity for him. He doesn\u2019t know if the country is going to be in a position to provide for him in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Kuhn is not anti-magic, far from it, but he says we need to understand its power. \u201cThere\u2019s an evolutionary drive for us to explore things we don\u2019t understand. A magician like Dynamo has universal appeal because he\u2019s dealing with these raw psychological experiences.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77765c00bc3ae85cca23d08be66a299b48663856\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77765c00bc3ae85cca23d08be66a299b48663856/0_0_2206_1324/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pulling the trigger: Derren Brown\u2019s infamous Russian roulette stunt.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pulling the trigger: Derren Brown\u2019s infamous Russian roulette stunt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Youtube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The following day, we head out of the city to a car show in an old racetrack deep in the suburbs. A huge typhoon hit this area a few days earlier, and the whole event was almost cancelled, but instead they\u2019ve made it free to all, so throughout the day families wander around as very rich Japanese men in their early 20s arrive in souped-up muscle cars, find a spot and pop their bonnets to show their engines and the boots to show their sound systems. You can see why Dynamo chose to film here, it\u2019s real-life <em>Tokyo Drift</em>.</p> <p>As night falls, Dynamo gets ready for the big stunt. First, he gets four of the boy racers to line up and try to push him over \u2013 the four of them should easily be able to topple him, but as hard as they push, Dynamo is able to hold steady. Then he ups the ante and gets one of the guys, who can\u2019t be older than 20, to get in his sports car and floor it with Dynamo standing right in front. The guy starts revving, first a little, then a lot. Dynamo is holding the car back with his bare hands. The wheels are spinning, the air filling with exhaust, but the car isn\u2019t moving. I can feel my heart racing, too. There are little kids everywhere, if it went wrong it would be a disaster. Suddenly, Dynamo jumps out the way and the car zooms to the other end of the lot within seconds.</p> <p>In the past when I\u2019ve watched these shows, I\u2019ve felt uncomfortable \u2013 a good magician is a confidence trickster, someone who makes you believe the impossible. I wonder if there\u2019s really more that differentiates David Blaine and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/feb/01/conspiracy-theorist-david-icke-should-be-banned-from-australia-minister-told\" title=\"\">David Icke</a> than the calibre of the company they keep. Kuhn\u2019s research suggests there might not be.</p> <p>Dynamo has tried to change my mind about that. In his vision, the magician is a leveller whose modus operandi is not to take advantage of their audience, but to bring something seemingly impossible into a world that can often feel mundane. Talking to him about his motivation, seeing his big tricks up close, has certainly nudged me towards this lighter view of the dark arts.</p> <p>But it\u2019s after the trick is over, when Dynamo has left and the cameras are packed away, that I become a true convert. I spot the guy whose car it was. He\u2019s still agog, bent over staring at his own tyres, trying to work out what just happened. At one point he just looks up at the sky, as if the answer might be in the stars. I start to believe in the magic of magic.</p> <p><em>All episodes of Dynamo: Beyond Belief are available on Sky and Now TV</em></p>",

The PPP is only forgiven if at least 75% of the money is used to cover payroll costs \u2013 leaving little for business supplies, rent, or utilities. What was first announced as a forgivable $10,000 advance on an SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) was changed days later to $1,000 per employee a business previously had on staff.</p> <p>Small businesses on the west coast appear to have had a particularly hard time securing aid.

Almost exactly four years later, the parties, corporate events, weddings and other advance orders that make up the majority of her income dried up in mid-March.

It\u2019s work she does entirely on her own now, having been forced to lay off five part-time employees not only because she couldn\u2019t pay them, but because there\u2019s no room for more than one person to work in the Angel Cakes kitchen at a time and stay at a safe distance from anyone else. Those workers are now receiving unemployment benefits, but Angel is drawing no personal income.</p> <p>\u201cI have basically applied for every loan and every grant,\u201d said Angel, from the US Chamber of Commerce (full) to a Facebook small business aid program (no response yet) to a City of Oakland grant for low-income business owners (rejected). \u201cThey said they had $5,000 to give to 90 businesses, and they received 1,200 applications. Every program is overwhelmed.\u201d</p> <p>Angel did receive a $5,000 forgivable advance from the EIDL emergency grant, $1,000 for each employee \u2013 \u201cThe way I found out I got it was it just appeared in my bank account. There was no email, no letter, nothing.\u201d But she hesitated to apply for the larger PPP loan.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if the shelter in place order goes past 30 June ? What if some of my employees have different jobs? They might have moved, they might not be available. What if I can\u2019t get back up to my previous payroll?

  "<p>A firm advised by a former Conservative foreign secretary and a former chief prosecutor is funding a large-scale legal action in the English courts by a convicted Russian fraudster once banned from Britain.</p> <p>The firm, 17 Arm, which is advised by Malcolm Rifkind, Ken Macdonald and other establishment figures, is financing the legal claim by Alexander Tugushev against a Russian billionaire in an expensive and lengthy court battle.</p> <p>Tugushev was jailed for six years for fraud in Russia in 2007 after he was convicted of receiving an illicit payment while holding a government post. He disputes the conviction.</p> <p>In the legal action in London, he alleges that his former business partner has cheated him out of his share of a substantial fishing empire. He is suing to recover the share, which he values at $350m. 17 Arm would be paid a slice of that sum \u2013 running to millions of pounds \u2013 if he wins.</p> <p>The case throws a spotlight on a relatively novel and risky area of legal practice known as litigation funding. In such actions, a commercial firm backed by private investors pays the upfront cost of barristers and solicitors to fight a case for an individual who has a legal claim. If the individual wins, the commercial firm is rewarded with a cut of money won in court. If the individual loses, the firm gets nothing.</p> <p>This winner-takes-all approach is funding a significant number of lawsuits in Britain. But critics such as the <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/litigation-funders-are-a-growing-threat-to-our-justice-system-hj6r0s2nh\">former justice minister Lord Faulks</a> say it can mean that, for example, litigation is started to make a profit rather than to redress grievances.</p> <p>In a statement, 17 Arm said: \u201cLitigation funding is a common mechanism which empowers aggrieved people, who couldn\u2019t otherwise afford to bring litigation, to fight their cases and win justice.\u201d</p> <p>Lord Clanwilliam, 17 Arm\u2019s chairman, declined to respond when asked how much it would win if Tugushev were victorious in his legal claim. \u201cWe pride ourselves on discretion and do not discuss the specifics of our work,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://17recovery.com/about-us/\">Eton-educated businessman</a> described 17 Arm, which was set up three years ago, as being involved in litigation finance management as well as recovering and returning assets to their owners through investigative and legal means.

The Michigan Freedom Fund, which \u201cfights to champion conservative policies on behalf of Michigan taxpayers\u201d \u2013 including lower taxes \u2013 helped promote a rally in Michigan against the state\u2019s stay-at-home order.</p> <p>The MFF, which is chaired by Betsy and Dick DeVos\u2019 longtime political adviser, Greg McNeilly, helped promote, rather than organize, the Michigan rally.</p> <p>But the MFF exists, in large part, due to the DeVos family\u2019s largesse.</p> <p>The organization has received <a href=\"https://cfrsearch.nictusa.com/committees/516317\">more than $500,000</a> from a slew of family members. As well as Betsy DeVos, her husband donated $80,000 just last year. Betsy DeVos\u2019 brother-in-law Daniel and sister-in-law have also handed over tens of thousands to the fund.</p> <p>While Betsy DeVos has stopped donating to political causes while she serves as education secretary, her family has kept up the flow of cash. In the 2018 midterm elections, the DeVoses splashed at least <a href=\"https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2018/11/01/devos-family-big-bucks-republican-campaigns/1831731002/\">$7.6m on Republican candidates</a> and committees.</p> <p>They didn\u2019t end up with much to show for their money, as Republicans <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/republicans-midterms-popular-vote-worst-ever-1226441\">lost the House of Representatives</a>. If that was an example of the DeVoses not getting what they wanted, in 1997, DeVos herself outlined what she did expect to get for her money.</p> <p>\u201cI have decided,\u201d <a href=\"https://devosprize.wordpress.com/2009/08/28/soft-money-is-good-hard-earned-american-dollars-that-big-brother-has-yet-to-find-a-way-to-control/\">she wrote in RollCall</a>, \u201cto stop taking offense at the suggestion that we are buying influence. Now I simply concede the point. They are right. We do expect some things in return.</p> <p>\u201cWe expect to foster a conservative governing philosophy consisting of limited government and respect for traditional American virtues. We expect a return on our investment; we expect a good and honest government. Furthermore, we expect the Republican party to use the money to promote these policies, and yes, to win elections.\u201d</p>",

to make sure we can continue the success we have got.\u201d<br>The re-opening of schools remains a contentious issue between the federal and states and territory governments.</p> \n  <p>However, a

  "<p>Philippe Sands, 59, is a professor of law at University College London and a barrister. He appears regularly before the international courts: last year he acted for the prosecution in the Rohingya genocide case at The Hague. His memoir, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/22/east-west-street-origin-genocide-crimes-against-humanity-philippe-sands-review\">East West Street</a></em>, won the 2016 Baillie Gifford prize. His new book, <em>The Ratline</em>, is about an Austrian Nazi, Otto von W\u00e4chter, and his wife, Charlotte, who helped him to evade justice when he went on the run in 1945.</p> <p><strong>How is</strong><strong> </strong><em><strong>The Ratline</strong></em><strong> connected to </strong><em><strong>East West Street</strong></em><strong>?<br></strong>In 2010 I went to Lviv, in Ukraine, to give a lecture. That led to <em>East West Street</em>. It was supposed to be about my grandfather, Leon, who grew up there, and Hersch Lauterpacht and Rafael Lemkin [also from Lviv], the jurists who put the terms \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d and \u201cgenocide\u201d into international law. But then Hans Frank came into it: the governor of German-occupied Poland, who was hanged at Nuremberg. Following a speech he gave in Lviv, the Jews of the region known as Galicia [Lviv was its capital] were exterminated. I came across a book by Frank\u2019s son, Niklas. We met and became friends, and he introduced me to Horst, the son of Otto von W\u00e4chter, who was the Nazi governor of Lviv from 1942-1944 and Frank\u2019s deputy. Niklas hates his father; Horst doesn\u2019t. I made a documentary about them, then<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06lh2b5\"> a podcast</a> about Otto, and now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2020/apr/18/i-was-a-nazi-boy-then-everything-was-gone-philippe-sands-the-ratline-audio-extract\">this book</a>.</p> <p><em><strong>The Ratline</strong></em><strong> is very different from </strong><em><strong>East West Street</strong></em><strong>, isn\u2019t it? The reader is horrified, but </strong><strong>also gripped; at times, it\u2019s</strong><strong> like a thriller.<br></strong>Yes, and that was the source of bother. I\u2019m really fond of Horst, but he also upsets me [by defending Otto]. I would think: why am I putting myself through this? Then there\u2019s Charlotte. She fascinates me. She\u2019s a Nazi, but what she does for Otto is incredible; there\u2019s something almost beautiful about it. Until May, 1945, he\u2019s pulling all the strings \u2013 then, with one snap of a finger, the power balance is changed. He needs her absolutely.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He did monstrous things, but he was also a father, a lover, a husband, a highly cultured man</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>How has Horst reacted to </strong><em><strong>The Ratline</strong></em><strong>?<br></strong>He hasn\u2019t read it yet. He\u2019ll be upset. But other Von W\u00e4chters have already come out of the woodwork. One begged me not to publish; another asked me to forgive Otto. A book like this is worrying to them in terms of their reputation, particularly in the context of Austria, which has not come to terms with the war as Germany has. They think some things are best not talked about.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s remarkable is the way that you show Otto in the round.<br></strong>Yes. It\u2019s unhelpful to describe these men as monsters. He did monstrous things, but he was also a father, a lover, a husband, a highly cultured man. One scene that stays with me is in 1942, when the worst killing is going on. At the weekend, he\u2019s going boating. How do you do it? How do you round people up and murder them, then go home and, say, listen to an opera? This is the question, to which there\u2019s no satisfactory answer.</p> <p><strong>Has writing </strong><em><strong>The Ratline</strong></em><strong> brought you closer to understanding where such antisemitism comes from?<br></strong>Otto\u2019s is easier to account for. It comes through his dad, a German nationalist: the idea that in Vienna there are all these Jews from the east coming in. But Charlotte was from a little town. There were only 27 Jews there; her family were magnates, not downtrodden. The Catholic church played a role, and I suspect there was also a deep-seated fear of Bolshevism, which was considered a Jewish idea.</p> <p><strong>Is anti</strong><strong>semitism on the rise again? Are there parallels to be made?<br></strong>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s rampant in Britain. It\u2019s there on the far left, and the far right \u2013 and plainly, under Jeremy Corbyn, things were allowed to happen in the Labour party that shouldn\u2019t have. But in Europe, there\u2019s no question it is. The tropes in places like Hungary are very clear.</p> <p><strong>Are you frightened? Can it be stopped?<br></strong>I don\u2019t think history repeats itself, but nor does it learn. You get variations on a theme. When the coronavirus crisis is over, nationalism could be rampant. Or we could remember the lessons of the 30s; that the only way out of recession is via global solidarity and trade. Either way, we need to pay attention. Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/viktor-orban-ditches-mayor-plan-amid-claims-of-coronavirus-power-grab\">new laws in Hungary</a> are unparalleled in Europe. He can rule open-endedly by decree. Let\u2019s consider our own emergency legislation. Yes, it must be reviewed by parliament in six months. But who would have thought that in 2020 we\u2019d have a situation where people over 70 are told they can\u2019t leave the house? How much of a leap is it from that to: OK, we\u2019re going to place the elderly in \u201csafe areas\u201d? To care-home ghettoes?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/18/on-the-trail-of-a-nazi-war-criminal-its-my-duty-as-a-son-to-find-the-good-in-my-father\">On the trail of a Nazi war criminal: 'It's my duty as a son to find the good in my father'</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Four million Jews died in Galicia, including your grandfather\u2019s family, yet when Horst tries to defend his father, you remain so calm, so dispassionate.

The war was a dark hole that no one talked about.

Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel, New Zealand\u2019s Jacinda Ardern, and Taiwan\u2019s Tsai Ing-wen are among competent and compassionate women singled out for praise.</p> <p>Yet do the worst-performing leaders share dysfunctional characteristics beyond mere maleness? A war fixation is one. Poverty of imagination is another. They routinely trot out tired martial metaphors and cliches such as \u201cwartime president\u201d, \u201cblitz spirit\u201d, and \u201cfighting the invisible enemy\u201d.</p> <p>Lack of empathy also seems to be a common denominator, even among self-styled \u201cman of the people\u201d populists. This may be a product of class, culture or elite upbringing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dcaf9f1a68e950e6914de9a1609eb852b3ffda89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dcaf9f1a68e950e6914de9a1609eb852b3ffda89/0_116_5400_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New Zealand\u2019s prime minister Jacinda Ardern speaks to the media.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New Zealand\u2019s prime minister Jacinda Ardern has been praised for her leadership.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hagen Hopkins/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A more decisive factor is a man\u2019s political orientation. Broadly speaking, illiberal leaders who run authoritarian regimes, refuse democratic and legal constraints, abuse civil and women\u2019s rights, reject media scrutiny, tolerate corruption, and believe that they, personally, know best are the worst-behaved, least effective pandemic performers.</p> <p>Donald Trump ticks all the boxes. He is the Covid champ of chumps. His advice last week to inject disinfectant hit new heights of toxic idiocy, even for him. But there are plenty of challengers for the world title.</p> <p>Take Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey\u2019s \u201cstrongman\u201d president. His initial response to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/turkeys-covid-19-infection-rate-rising-fastest-in-the-world\">growing Covid-19 threat</a> was to put the economy before lives. Erdogan is accused, like Trump, of politicising the crisis, for example by banning fundraising efforts by opposition-controlled city councils in Istanbul, Izmir, and Ankara. The impressive performance of Istanbul\u2019s mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, a possible 2023 presidential rival, is said to worry him more than the disease.</p> <p>Rushed curfews and protective measures have caused confusion and panic-buying. And Erdogan fumbled a chance to foster unity of purpose when an early release of prisoners excluded jailed political opponents, journalists and human rights activists.<br><br>The world expects better of Turkey. In the Philippines, the macho antics of Rodrigo Duterte, a president notorious for celebrating extrajudicial murder, are par for the course. Like right-wingers elsewhere, Duterte minimised the Covid-19 threat, then over-reacted.</p> <p>A typically heavy-handed clampdown has followed belated lockdown measures. Duterte ordered the police and military to kill those who did not comply. \u201cShoot them dead,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/poverty-punished-philippines-tough-virus-pandemic-200413063921536.html\">he urged</a>. \u201cInstead of causing trouble, I\u2019ll send you to the grave.\u201d</p> <p>Duterte\u2019s assumption of emergency powers mirrors power-grabs in other countries with weak systems of democratic accountability. Hungary\u2019s rightwing populist leader, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, says his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\">new power to rule indefinitely</a> by decree can be revoked any time. Opponents fear a tame parliament may never do so.</p> <p>Some of the world\u2019s most authoritarian leaders have reacted with a morbid mix of crass irresponsibility and calculation. Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil\u2019s president, <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/20/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-coronavirus-denialism-fire-mandetta-mourao-wont-hurt-him/\">appears to hope</a>, Trump-like, that he can turn the poor\u2019s hostility to job-destroying lockdowns to political advantage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6660836db4c2e7e136a4dab7c3165663591b400b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6660836db4c2e7e136a4dab7c3165663591b400b/0_0_3203_2185/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police check the temperature of motorcyclists in Manila on Friday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"682\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police check the temperature of motorcyclists in Manila on Friday.

If Brazil\u2019s economy implodes, Bolsonaro, weirdly, could be the gainer \u2013 unless he is impeached first.</p> <p>China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, is also using the pandemic for political ends, as evidenced by the opportunistic arrest last week of 15 veteran Hong Kong pro-democracy figures. Virus-related security and economic fears <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/fresh-hong-kong-crackdown-will-result-in-deaths-says-democracy-leader-martin-lee\">are being exploited</a> to justify an ever tighter crackdown after last year\u2019s failure to halt anti-Beijing protests.<br><br>But the hard men are not having it all their own way. Xi\u2019s carefully nurtured reputation for quasi-celestial infallibility has taken a knock in the wake of the Wuhan disaster. The shine is also coming off India\u2019s Hindu nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi.</p> <p>Modi seemed to carry all before him last year, especially following the Kashmir crackdown. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/india-delhi-after-hindu-mob-riot-religious-hatred-nationalists\">brutal anti-Muslim pogrom</a> in Delhi barely dented his domestic standing. But self-inflicted economic and social damage arising from clumsy, chaotic anti-virus measures are painting a less flattering portrait of incompetence and irrelevance.<br><br>Likewise the credibility of Vladimir Putin, the Russian president who specialises in exporting lethal germs, is in question after a slow start to the fightback.</p> <p>Shielding himself from harm, he-man Putin <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/20/russias-coronavirus-outbreak-why-it-could-be-bad-news-for-president-putin.html\">looks on impotently</a> as Russia\u2019s coronavirus caseload spirals upwards and the global oil price, key source of Kremlin cash, goes the other way.<br><br>In contrast, the pandemic has saved Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, from deserved oblivion. After a third, inconclusive election, and with a corruption trial looming, Netanyahu looked dead and buried. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/netanyahu-and-gantz-agree-to-form-unity-israeli-government\">His resurrection</a> is largely due to unscrupulous use of the virus threat as a national rallying cause.<br><br>Faced by all this bad behaviour, despair is an option. As Eliot wrote in<em> </em>The Hollow Men, \u201cThis is the way the world ends/ Not with a bang but with a whimper\u201d. And yet, perhaps not.</p> <p>Progressives can take comfort from the way autocrats and rightwing populists have mostly flunked the Covid-19 challenge. Maybe people around the world, shocked by all the high-handed bungling, will begin to resist and reverse the recent trend towards authoritarianism.</p> <p>It would be reassuring to think so. On the whole, democracies have behaved better during the crisis. But the UK and US responses have been dismal. Maybe that\u2019s because, in both cases, a certain kind of shallow, arrogant man is in charge.</p>",
  "<p>Boris Johnson\u2019s expected return to Number 10 this week is triggering much speculation about whether his brush with mortality has made him a changed man. We should hope it has.</p> <p>The pre-infection prime minister belonged to the entertainer branch of populist leadership that prospered in more insouciant times. Before an invisible enemy changed everything, one former cabinet minister tried to explain the Johnson phenomenon by telling me: \u201cBoris is not really a politician like the rest of us. Boris is a brand. One day, someone will start selling Eau de Boris.\u201d</p> <p>He has lived his life to Winston Churchill\u2019s maxim: \u201cSuccess consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.\u201d His career is potholed with scandals, betrayals and mendacities that would have undone many another politician, but he somehow always bounced back. His party did not make him leader because they thought he would be a diligent administrator, a wise head or a safe pair of hands in a national emergency. His party made him leader because they thought he was a lucky mascot, he was their best communicator and they were desperate for someone to cheer them up after the mirthless agonies of the May years. I lost count of the Tory MPs who voted for him saying: \u201cBoris is a terrible man, but he will be great fun.\u201d The voters confirmed him as prime minister not because they thought he had the qualities necessary to handle a pandemic. He was returned to Number 10 because he was an energetic frontman for the Tories up against a deeply unpopular opponent.</p> <p>He is about to marry his third wife and has children by women who have never been his wife. A raffish private life and a rascally public one magnified \u201cbrand Boris\u201d in the mind of both his colleagues and the public. He became one of those rare politicians who is referred to by their first names. Before he was struck down by the coronavirus, he had thought himself unusually robust. Getting to the top of the greasy pole despite his many career car crashes was taken as further evidence of his indestructibility. Friends report that he used to view illness in others not as a misfortune but as a sign of personal weakness.</p> <p>I dwell on these character traits because they have made a material difference to the government\u2019s response to the epidemic and are essential to understanding many of its mistakes. In the early period of the crisis, he was conscious that he needed to get more serious, but only patchily successful at being so. He oscillated between straining for a pseudo-Churchillian gravitas and sounding blithe with occasional lapses back into clowning. In early March, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/how-coronavirus-advice-from-boris-johnson-has-changed\">casually declared</a> that he had visited a hospital with coronavirus patients \u201cand I shook hands with everybody\u201d. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>His party made him leader because they thought he was a lucky mascot</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He used the comedy phrase \u201csquashing the sombrero\u201d to describe the effort to flatten the peak of infection. In conversation with potential manufacturers of ventilators, he joked about \u201cOperation Last Gasp\u201d.</p> <p>All of which strongly suggests that he was slow to grasp the seriousness of the threat and oblivious to his own vulnerability to infection.</p> <p>Number 10 has reacted with a scolded defensiveness to the revelation that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/michael-gove-fails-to-deny-pm-missed-five-coronavirus-cobra-meetings\">he missed the first five C</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/michael-gove-fails-to-deny-pm-missed-five-coronavirus-cobra-meetings\">obra meetings about coronavirus</a> in late January and February and only started to turn up once it was confirmed that infection had broken out in Britain. It is true that the crisis committee has not always been led by prime ministers in the past; it is equally true that a prime minister who was fully alert to the scale of the menace would have insisted on chairing those meetings.</p> <p>There is a gathering consensus that he ought to have been quicker to order a lockdown. It now seems incredible that, even after the government accepted that Britain faced \u201cthe worst public health crisis in a generation\u201d, pubs and gyms remained open while many thousands of people were permitted to mingle at football matches, racecourses and pop concerts. The personality of the prime minister was not the only factor in play, but it was a significant one. This is a man who doesn\u2019t like rules and much of his biography involves the breaking of them. Overestimating how many of his fellow Britons think as he does, all his basic instincts were repelled by the idea of a lockdown and he reckoned there would be a rebellion against it. Officials and colleagues also report that he was reluctant to accept that the triumphant story he had composed in his head about his premiership was going to be rewritten by a microbe. You will recall how he would ridicule opponents of Brexit as \u201cthe doomsters and the gloomsters\u201d. He couldn\u2019t resist a similar boosterism when it came to the disease. In mid-March, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/how-coronavirus-advice-from-boris-johnson-has-changed\">breezily proclaimed</a> that \u201cwe can send coronavirus packing\u201d before suggesting that \u201cwe can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks\u201d, an assertion that his scientific advisers conspicuously declined to agree with. </p> <p>Even when he did finally announce a lockdown, it was with obvious reluctance as he lamented \u201ctaking away the ancient and inalienable right of every freeborn Englishman to go to the pub\u201d.</p> <p>He did then get much crisper in his communications with the nation. One thing that can be said for Mr Johnson and the team around him at Number 10 is that they have a talent for crafting strong and simple messages, skills with the demotic that were honed during the Brexit referendum and the 2019 election. The frontman for \u201cTake Back Control\u201d and \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d now bashed into the public consciousness \u201cStay at Home\u201d, \u201cProtect the NHS\u201d and \u201cSave Lives\u201d.</p> <p>The video he released after his discharge from hospital was his most effective public performance of the crisis to date. There was dramatic revelation about his personal ordeal: \u201cIt could have gone either way\u201d. The thanks expressed to the NHS \u2013 \u201cthe best of us\u201d \u2013 gave every appearance of being heartfelt. And he used the opportunity to again drill home the government\u2019s essential messages on social distancing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a gathering consensus that he ought to have been quicker to order a lockdown</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This has worked. Public cooperation with the lockdown has been much more comprehensive than ministers anticipated. Fears that the NHS would be overwhelmed by coronavirus victims have not, so far, been realised.</p> <p>Much of the rest of the picture remains grim. The official fatality rate is now around 20,000 and the real one is higher. The toll on the economy becomes more savage by the day. Some Tories are hoping that their leader will return to Downing Street wearing his sunny face. \u201cWe need him back to cheer us all up,\u201d says one senior Conservative. That wish is way too premature. The next phase of this crisis will bring with it exceptionally hard decisions, ones that have been waiting on his reappearance because no one was properly empowered to substitute for him during his absence. These choices are too fiendish to be hidden behind a deceiving mask of bogus optimism.</p> <p>The arguments boiling up within the cabinet about rival versions of an \u201cexit strategy\u201d cannot be contained behind closed doors for any longer. The prime minister faces a host of complicated choices about when and how to ease the lockdown that all add up to one giant decision. Is the aim to maximise the repression of the disease at an ever-escalating cost to the economy and with rising deaths from other causes? Or does he choose to experiment with a more permissive relaxation of the restrictions at the risk of a resurgence in infection, leading to the much-dreaded second wave? To magnify the challenge, the scientists are candid that there is much that they still do not fully comprehend about the virus.</p> <p>There are no easy outcomes here, none that can be compressed into simple three-word slogans. All paths are perilous and the decision about which to take will have to be made without completely reliable information.</p> <p>Some leaders are trying to navigate their way through this hellish maze by treating their citizens like adults and levelling with them about the uncertainties and the competing risks. By doing so, they hope to garner public consent and understanding.</p> <p>Angela Merkel is the standout example of this type of leadership in Europe. True leadership is not about concealing the hard nature of the choices confronting the nation. True leadership requires honesty about them.</p> <p>One of the first things Boris Johnson has to decide when he returns to Number 10 is whether to start being frank with the country about the horribly difficult decisions that lie before us. His personal experience with the disease will guarantee him an audience, but the skills required for leading this conversation are not those of the entertainer.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",

The set dressing only reinforces that impression \u2013 peregrine nests are bleakly exposed boxes of gravel strewn with dismembered pigeon parts. A friend who watched one pair dourly raise four gawky chicks on bloody morsels of birds, nicknamed them \u201cTed and Sylvia\u201d.</p> <p>Tricia Glass is one of the cathedral volunteers for whom the peregrine webcam is a connection to a place they cherish and are currently excluded from. I can hear her excitement as she tells me how Sally, the resident female, found herself without a mate in 2018, then failed to defend her nest against an incoming pair in 2019, returning in the middle of the night (\u201c17 May, that\u2019s how much I watch them\u201d) to attempt a coup. \u201cThere were some fairly spectacular fights on the tower, absolutely bloodthirsty.\u201d She\u2019s far from alone: Salisbury\u2019s webcam drew 6,008 page views in March 2019; this year it was more than 55,000 so far.</p> <p>But Monty and Sally may not return; not all stories have happy endings. \u201cIt\u2019s not Disney\u201d is a phrase you hear frequently in nestcam circles. Some species lay more eggs than they can successfully raise; fledgling tragedies are commonplace. Famously, in 2014, the <a href=\"https://www.whoi.edu/ospreycam/page.do?pid=41055\" title=\"\">Woods Hole osprey cam</a> in the US created online horror when the female began attacking and starving her chicks.

A big part of the communication strategy at Cornell is explaining that (with the exception of some critically endangered species) non-intervention when things go \u201cwrong\u201d is usually the ethical approach, however difficult to watch. It\u2019s also about explaining that upsetting behaviours can be normal and natural.</p> <p>\u201cThere are species for whom living on that edge of failing is part of their history,\u201d Eldermire explains. Cornell\u2019s philosophy is that individual upset can be usefully reframed and refocused on species-level concern and conservation. \u201cIf you feel like these individuals are important and you\u2019re bummed about that cat eating them, we need to think about our own choices and our own governments.\u201d</p> <p>For others, it\u2019s less a thirst for drama that drives our viewing than a craving for a natural world we can\u2019t currently experience in person. \u201cNow, more than ever, plenty of people don\u2019t have access to nature,\u201d says Eldermire. The popularity of nestcams \u201cunderscores the power that experiencing nature has, even if it\u2019s just through a screen. That we can transmit a slice of it and still have an effect is marvellous, but it\u2019s also something to marvel at.\u201d</p> <p>For Eldermire part of the appeal is the sense you are experiencing nature firsthand. \u201cYou don\u2019t control the binoculars, but there\u2019s a true validity to the experience. You\u2019re not selecting the playlist in Spotify for \u2018calm work mode\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReal\u201d birdwatchers might disagree. Richard Smyth is the author of <em>An Indifference of Birds</em>, which explores how the lives of humans and birds intersect (or don\u2019t). He partly agrees with Eldermire. \u201cThe birds don\u2019t know they\u2019re supposed to be performing and there\u2019s no director bellowing, \u2018Be magnificent!\u2019\u201d Despite that, the experience of watching through webcams seems to him a partly artificial one. \u201cThere\u2019s a school of thought where it\u2019s not an authentic experience if you haven\u2019t taken three days to walk across the Trossachs to find it; that it\u2019s a mediated modern experience that is not truly authentic.\u201d</p> <p>Smyth does see the value of filmed footage. \u201cAnyone being sniffy is missing this really obvious point: you\u2019re just not going to see that kind of behaviour, that kind of detail in any other way. What other chance have you got to see eggs in a nest, eggs hatching?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df782a2f756c77264a1bbd28fb61580c54383afc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df782a2f756c77264a1bbd28fb61580c54383afc/306_65_2749_1650/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New arrival: adults stand arund a new chick as seen on the Royal Albatross Cam.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New arrival: adults stand arund a new chick as seen on the Royal Albatross birdcam.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cornell Lab Bird Cams</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He will happily watch a peregrine cam. The falcon\u2019s resurgence as an urban bird, nesting on church spires and tower blocks after decades of critical endangerment, is an extraordinary success story that features in his book. \u201cYou have to stop and think: \u2018Hang on, 30 or 40 years ago this would have seemed absolutely mad.\u2019 Webcams are helping us get in touch with that.\u201d</p> <p>A webcam can\u2019t compare with the solitary thrill of seeing a flash of osprey in the wild, though, as he did as a \u201cbird mad\u201d 11-year-old. \u201cSome people enjoy communal experiences and some don\u2019t. It\u2019s nice to know people are sharing in nature, but I don\u2019t get a lot out of that.\u201d</p> <p>Others do \u2013 nestcams such as the Cornell ones are, above all, communities where watchers swap observations. \u201cIt\u2019s like the guys hanging around the cooler talking about the sports game,\u201d says Eldermire. \u201cOne of the reasons these communities form is that they allow people to share what it\u2019s like to be doing this. These cameras are one of the few things left, beside sport, where they happen live.\u201d</p> <p>Dyfi too is a collective experience. I spend a few days on the osprey chat and quickly get hooked. There\u2019s not much happening \u2013 lots of shots of windswept nests and Telyn moodily dismembering the occasional fish \u2013 but the collective wait for Monty creates its own drama. It\u2019s a sweetly supportive place, too, where minute observations of twig placement as the osprey nest takes shape alternate with swapped bread recipes and reminiscences from previous years. I\u2019m tickled when someone mentions an osprey bringing its mate a Battenberg cake. Another makes me laugh by saying: \u201cHere we are, 493 people staring at an empty nest.\u201d</p> <p>Nestcam communities needn\u2019t be national or international. The technology is simple and affordable; backyard cams are increasingly common. Catherine and her partner installed a webcam after a pair of barn owls adopted the nest box in her home in the Cairngorms. She now shares footage on a private Facebook group of 140 who post comments, pictures and jokes about \u201cclaw sanitiser\u201d. She and the other watchers are especially looking forward to the chicks this year. The owls are \u201ca salutary and cheering reminder to us all that there are so many creatures on the earth to whom we\u2019re neither here nor there.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ca4c655eeedc225c88a593fedaa721a7022bd9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ca4c655eeedc225c88a593fedaa721a7022bd9e/570_0_2790_1675/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Now is the moment to get hooked, as the eggs start to hatch\u2019: a female white-tailed tropicbird sits with her young chick.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Now is the moment to get hooked, as the eggs start to hatch\u2019: a female white-tailed tropicbird sits with her young chick.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cornell Lab Bird Cams</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em><strong>That\u2019s why I love</strong></em> nestcams, too. Our predicaments, however all-consuming, seem irrelevant to creatures preoccupied with the yearly drama of reproduction and survival. Ten years ago, recently separated and sharing custody of my children, my life felt sad, strange and empty. I sat in my grotty kitchen scanning the internet for distraction until an acquaintance sent me a link to a Dutch webcam of an eagle owl incubating two eggs on a rocky outcrop.</p> <p>Eagle owls are vast, orange-eyed beauties with murderous talons. There was a strange, stolen intimacy to watching something I should, in normal circumstances, never be able to see. The female occasionally moved, or ate the prey her mate brought her, but mainly she sat, stoic and unmoving. It should have been boring, but it wasn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t see the eggs hatch, but I remember waking to see two bedraggled clumps of wet feather, moving jerkily. I spent hours staring at the terrifyingly fragile babies, wobbly heads too big for their bodies, watching as they ate, grew and lost their fluff. They started practising heart-stopping hops and flaps. Eventually, wonderfully, they fledged. I was bereft \u2013 and hooked. Even now, when I\u2019m anxious, I think back to those magical evenings watching owl babies learn to fly on a strange rock in another country.</p> <p>For anyone with anxiety and an appetite for a good story (all of us, surely), now is the perfect moment to get hooked, as eggs start to hatch. For first-time watchers, Eldermire recommends picking a cam with a high success rate: the <a href=\"https://www.allaboutbirds.org/cams/barred-owls/\" title=\"\">Cornell barred owl clutch</a> is on the verge of hatching as I write and, Eldermire assures me, \u201cevery year they are successful\u201d. This morning there was great excitement in Dyfi: Telyn has laid her first egg (Idris is the father: he celebrated with a gift of fish). Peregrine eggs across the UK are hatching now, too: pick a cam on a local landmark for an additional thrill.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to get very excited,\u201d says Tricia Glass, as the Salisbury interlopers incubate four eggs on screen in front of her (the last egg was laid at the end of March, so there should be chicks soon if all goes well). \u201cI\u2019ve been feeling quite flat the last couple of weeks, but just talking about it reminds me of last year and how wonderful and exciting it was.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The number of new cases of Covid-19 being diagnosed is still much too high to allow any easing of the lockdown soon, leading scientists have warned, as the virus death toll in UK hospitals passed 20,000 on Saturday.</p> \n<p>The home secretary, Priti Patel, described the figure as a \u201cterrible milestone\u201d and a \u201cdeeply tragic and moving moment\u201d. She said it showed the need for the British public to \u201cstay strong\u201d and remain at home for the foreseeable future.</p> \n<p>A further 813 deaths were reported in hospitals, taking the UK total to 20,319.

We will have to get case numbers down a lot lower than they are now before we can think of lifting current regulations.\u201d</p> \n<p>Professor Keith Neal of Nottingham University agreed that the number of patients being taken to hospital with Covid-19 remained far too high. \u201cThis daily figure peaked on 5 April with 5,903 cases. This Saturday it stood at 3,583,\u201d he added. This latter figure was boosted by an extra 1,330 new cases of infected care and health workers, which brought Saturday\u2019s overall total to 4,913.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt has therefore taken three weeks for numbers of hospitalised Covid-19 patients to decline from a daily total of 5,903 to 3,641.\u201d</p> \n<p>Professor Paul Hunter, of the University of East Anglia, added: \u201cThere is no doubt this rate of decline is disappointing. Certainly it is far too high to consider lifting lockdown restrictions at present. We need to get numbers down to a few hundred new cases a day before we can do that. Such a decline could take months.\u201d</p> \n<p>With no firm indication being given by the government on when social distancing rules might be eased, prime minister Boris Johnson will return to Downing Street on Monday after convalescing at Chequers, having fallen seriously ill with Covid-19 earlier this month.</p> \n<p>The prime minister is facing an acute dilemma over the lockdown as members of his cabinet and MPs in his party argue over whether it should be eased to save the economy from collapse \u2013 the predominant view in the Treasury \u2013 or whether the public should be told to double down on restrictions to reduce the death toll. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is pushing the more cautious approach.</p> \n<p>Former chancellor Philip Hammond said on Saturday it was time that the government announced plans for an exit strategy, while Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, said MPs wanted to see a strategy for desperate businesses. He said: \u201cAll members of parliament must be receiving representations from businesses large and small needing further assistance, or some sense of when they can start to plan for at least a partial release from these measures.\u201d</p> \n<p>But Patel insisted the government\u2019s five tests for easing the lockdown had to be met in full. \u201cIt is clear that is not right now,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Amid signs that public confidence in the government\u2019s handling of the crisis is waning in a new Opinium poll for the <em>Observer</em>, ministers are facing an uphill battle to meet their target of testing 100,000 people a day for Covid-19 by the end of April.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/trust-wanes-in-uk-ministers-handling-of-coronavirus-pandemic-poll\">Public trust plummets in Britain's handling of pandemic, new poll reveals</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As of 9am, a total of 640,792 tests had taken place, with 28,760 being conducted on Friday.</p> \n<p>Downing Street said the prime minister had said he was \u201craring to go\u201d after being given the green light by doctors, who had been closely monitoring his progress since he was discharged from St Thomas\u2019 hospital two weeks ago.

If we want to take people with us and secure their consent, this is necessary now.\u201d</p> \n<p>Meanwhile the Department of Health and Social Care announced that mobile testing units, operated by the armed forces, would travel around the UK to increase access to coronavirus testing.</p> \n<p>On Saturday the website offering tests to key workers was overwhelmed for the second day running by 10am, with people in the south of England reporting that the only tests available were in Scotland.</p> \n<p>The DHSC said the new units would respond to areas of highest demand, travelling to test frontline workers and the most vulnerable at sites including care homes, police stations and prisons.</p>",
  "<p>I heard the first cuckoo on Wednesday evening. I was outside the back door splitting logs when the song floated down from the copse on Bryn Arw, the hill behind our house in the Black Mountains. Cuckoos have been coming to the same copse for as long as we have lived here and I have always written down the date of their arrival from Africa. It is an important moment in the turning year, as the lyrics to the traditional medieval round attest: \u201cSumer is icumen in/ Lhude sing cuccu.\u201d</p> <p>My recordings of cuckoos have always been haphazard, though. Some years, because the weather is dreadful or I am working hard and chained to a desk, I fail to get outside. I might first hear<a href=\"https://www.xeno-canto.org/37447\"> the male\u2019s distinctive song</a>, which gives the bird its onomatopoeic name, days after his actual arrival.</p> <p>Other years, I have been abroad for work. This year, however, I have the correct date. There is no doubt, since every evening for the past four weeks I have been in the garden \u2013 weeding the vegetable patch, painting a bench, splitting alder logs and, on occasion, sitting in a chair looking up the hill with pricked ears, waiting for him. The cuckoo arrived on 22 April and I wrote it down in my notebook.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d4b5b2822bea8e86a11aa50aedf8bec8e252edf3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4b5b2822bea8e86a11aa50aedf8bec8e252edf3/0_208_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stacked alder logs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stacked alder logs, with dandelions and lesser celandines in the foreground.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Penn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Observing the changing seasons is a fascination as old as the seasons themselves. There is a strange satisfaction in knowing that the arrival of the first cuckoo, with its gratifying intimations of summer round the corner, is a pleasure we partake in with people who lived hundreds and, presumably, thousands of years ago.</p> <p>The first person to actually write down the times of the recurring natural phenomena that mark spring\u2019s arrival was Robert Marsham, a Norfolk squire. In 1736, he recorded the first swallow, the dates different trees came into leaf, first flowering or blossoming dates, first time he heard frogs croaking and rooks nesting, first appearance of butterflies and the earliest singing of the cuckoo. In all, he recorded 27 seasonal occurrences in what he called his \u201cIndications of Spring\u201d.</p> <p>He maintained <a href=\"https://www.robertmarsham.co.uk/about-robert-marsham/indications-of-spring/\">this record</a>, without interruption, for more than 60 years. It became his life\u2019s work. More remarkably still, successive generations of his family continued the record \u2013 until 1958. The field of study the Marshams effectively invented is called phenology.</p> <p>I am no phenologist. This spring, though, I have become a keen and patient student of nature, with notebook in hand. For the first time in my adult life, I have the hours to sensitively bear witness to the delicate, daily changes. And I have taken the trouble to record them, like Marsham. In our small wood, I have observed the succession of wild flowers, all eager for their moment in the sun before the tree canopy closes over them. The sequence started in early March with lesser celandines and, a few days later, primroses; then came sweet violets, wild daffodils, wood anemones and greater stitchwort, in that order; next, yellow archangel flowered by the stream; last week, red campion, garlic-scented <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/apr/23/seasons-eatings-wild-garlic\">ransoms</a> and bluebells, the wild flower that has the power of Prozac on the British collective consciousness, all bloomed. They have been entered in the notebook.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bad77cbcd7219be6ada61580ec0669797ee05de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bad77cbcd7219be6ada61580ec0669797ee05de/0_289_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sessile oaks coming into leaf.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Sessile oaks are leafing as I write.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Penn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Similarly, there are entries about the progression of leafing trees. Elder and horse chestnut were first, in mid-March. Sycamore, then hawthorn, rowan, silver birch and pedunculate oak followed. Beech, field maple and sessile oak are all leafing as I write. I have logged the conspicuous unfurling of the first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/07/country-diary-harts-tongue-ferns-thrive-in-the-gloom-otley-west-yorkshire\">hart\u2019s tongue fern</a> and the first broad buckler fern.</p> <p>The first brimstone and orange tip butterflies are logged. The arrivals of pied flycatchers and willow warblers from sub-Saharan Africa are accounted for. Damson and wild cherry blossom, dandelions, daisies, wasps, red mason bees, nest-building blue tits and song thrushes are all minuted. There are even notes on the time it takes for the alder I have been splitting to oxidise; the process turns the exposed wood <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/06/country-diary-a-chainsaw-massacre-in-the-alder-woods\">a rich orange colour</a>.</p> <p>In fact, keeping a nature diary is beginning to feel like a chore and I\u2019m still not sure why I am doing it.</p> <p>Gilbert White, the best-known nature diarist of the 18th century and a correspondent of Marsham, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/11/gilbert-white-fourth-most-published-book-in-english-language-natural-history-and-antiquities-of-selborne-to-go-online\">published </a><em>The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne</em>, in 1789, as a weapon in the fight against the \u201csuperstitious prejudices\u201d held by the \u201clower people\u201d of his district in Hampshire.</p> <p>White, like his brother-in-law, Thomas Barker, who kept a punctilious weather diary for six decades, and Marsham, were part of a new breed of amateur naturalists that emerged towards the end of the Enlightenment era. Keeping a journal became the prevailing method of reducing weather and the natural world to a definitive system.</p> <p>Today, phenology is even more important than when White and Marsham lived, because of the insight it provides into the effects of climate change. The largest phenology database, part of a project called <a href=\"https://naturescalendar.woodlandtrust.org.uk/\">Nature\u2019s Calendar</a>, is held by the Woodland Trust. Thousands of people add their own recordings to the website every year and the data is used in academic research.</p> <p>I may add my observations to the database, but citizen science is not the main reason why, this year, I am observing nature with the methodology of an 18th-century country parson. Rather, I am trying to comprehend events by ordering what is around me. As William Faulkner said: \u201cTo understand the world, you must first understand a place.\u201d His place was Mississippi, mine is the Black Mountains.</p> <p>Observing the changing seasons in a diary is also an internally imposed discipline, a form of spiritual self-monitoring, while the storm rages elsewhere. How long the diary will last into summer, I can\u2019t yet tell. For now though, pen poised, I am waiting for the first swallow.</p> <p><em>Rob Penn is the author of </em>The Man Who Made Things Out of Trees</p>",

How does she feel? \u201cTo be fair, it has been a headfuck,\u201d she responds, before reeling off more figures.</p> <p>Mai-Davies became a TikTok influencer after a video she posted of her boyfriend pretending to break the coronavirus lockdown \u2013 by creeping down their road in a grass-covered costume \u2013 went viral. (At the time of writing, it had 1.6m views.) Sudden fame has left Mai-Davies punch-drunk on her own celebrity. \u201c<em>This Morning</em> got in contact with me,\u201d she says breathlessly. \u201cThey want me to FaceTime Holly and Phil. We\u2019ve been in hundreds of articles in 20 different counties.\u201d</p> <p>Becoming a TikTok influencer is now a viable career. \u201cI want to be a content creator and make people laugh,\u201d says 24-year-old <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/nsT2WV/\">Akafi Ali</a>, from London. Ali quit his job as a Sainsbury\u2019s cashier to pursue his TikTok dream: his videos satirise Somali culture or feature Ali on caterwauling form. \u201cEveryone is going to the supermarket to grab toilet rolls!\u201d Ali says in one video. \u201cAre you serious? Just wash your ass!\u201d</p> <p>Ali says TikTok was already popular before coronavirus, but that the lockdown has supercharged it. \u201cThere are a lot more people jumping on,\u201d he says. With this influx of new influencers comes competition. \u201cBefore, if you uploaded a video, you could easily get 100,000 views in the first hour,\u201d says Ali. \u201cBut now you don\u2019t get on the For You page as easily as before.\u201d (For You is the landing page on TikTok, tailored to users\u2019 interests.)</p> <p>Mai-Davies also plans to give the TikTok influencer thing a go and is posting daily videos. \u201cWhen I go to bed, I think about ideas for tomorrow\u2019s video,\u201d she says. She tells me that some young girls have set up a fan page about her on Instagram. \u201cThey write, \u2018I love her so much, she\u2019s my Queen,\u2019\u201d she says. She sounds bemused. \u201cThis is so crazy. How have I got a fan page?\u201d</p> <p>The most important thing to understand about TikTok is that it is anarchic: it has no internal logic or guiding principle. Many TikTok videos are absurdist jokes. People surprise family members, impersonate celebrities or set up elaborate punchlines. The platform frequently has the surreal quality of a fever dream: videos riff on arcane internet ephemera or make nonsensical jokes. Non-sequiturs are common. Creativity is paramount.</p> <p>\u201cSurrealism is embedded into the DNA of the internet,\u201d says Kenneth Goldsmith, author of <em>Wasting Time on the Internet</em>. He sees TikTok\u2019s popularity as a natural reaction to the oppressive mania of a global lockdown \u2013 it is a pressure valve for people cooped up indoors. \u201cThe only response to an existential situation is absurdity and humour,\u201d Goldsmith says. \u201cIt brings us back to the darker side of surrealism.\u201d</p> <p>On Instagram, we are primped and preening, on Twitter, loudmouthed and strident, but on TikTok, we can just be weird. Which makes it the perfect platform to ride out a pandemic that has nearly one-third of the world\u2019s population trapped at home. \u201cIt\u2019s therapeutic,\u201d Goldsmith explains. \u201cIf we look at Freud\u2019s theorising of the joke, the joke is always about showing humour in the face of death.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sort of embarrassed by it,\u201d says <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/nGNWao/\">John Palmer</a> of his TikTok account. The 17-year-old, from County Durham, specialises in the sort of hyper-surreal videos you\u2019d expect to jump into through a chalk pavement drawing \u2013 if Mary Poppins used TikTok. Typically, Palmer\u2019s videos refer to popular memes or obscure internet jokes.</p> <p>In one video, Palmer rips a much-memed Michelle Obama soundbite to make a joke about Prince William using coronavirus to leapfrog Charles in the line of succession. In another, he pretends to talk to the squadron of imaginary friends he\u2019s made in self-isolation. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of about finding the template, but pushing the meme as far as it will go, making it weirder and weirder, until it gets to a point where it doesn\u2019t make sense unless you\u2019ve seen everything else before,\u201d Palmer says. \u201cIt spirals down into something else.\u201d</p> <p>This is TikTok as pure subculture: in order to participate at Palmer\u2019s level, you need to have swum through digital water since childhood, a graceful stroke through each platform \u2013 Facebook, Vine, Instagram \u2013 that is easy and assured. There is no need for gatekeepers: the price of admission to this subculture is simply understanding the joke. \u201cI show it to my parents and they don\u2019t get it,\u201d Palmer explains. \u201cIt\u2019s the meme culture of Gen Z. There\u2019s so much background to memes. You need to have lived through them.\u201d</p> <p>As a TikTok old timer, Palmer is mortified by the platform\u2019s exploding popularity during the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI\u2019m not looking forward to all of the adults discovering TikTok,\u201d he says with a sigh.</p> <p>There\u2019s a simple reason why people are flocking to TikTok: it\u2019s a superb time waster. And in lieu of freedom or gainful employment, right now the only thing the British public has in abundance is time to burn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Rachel Leary on TikTok\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tiktok-embed&quot; cite=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@rachleary/video/6807502301582871814&quot; data-video-id=&quot;6807502301582871814&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;&quot; &gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;@rachleary&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@rachleary&quot;&gt;@rachleary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Welcome to my stay-at-home-covid-19-update rave x &lt;a title=&quot;coronavirus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/coronavirus&quot;&gt;##coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;foryou&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foryou&quot;&gt;##foryou&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;foryoupage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foryoupage&quot;&gt;##foryoupage&lt;/a&gt; *contains flashing lights*&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;\u266c B.B.C.

There\u2019s nothing else to do.\u201d</p> <p>TikTok is designed to be addictive: you can scroll its dashboard for hours without ever running out of content. Its algorithm uses artificial intelligence to observe your interests and deliver videos that fit. Palmer tells me that since downloading TikTok on his phone, his screen time has gone up from seven hours a day to 12.</p> <p>And when you finally tire of scrolling through TikTok\u2019s neverending dashboard, you can start making videos. Palmer only started posting his own videos when the coronavirus lockdown started. \u201cI was locked in the house and had nothing else to do,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought making a video might be something to do for a day to occupy myself.\u201d He sounds surprised. \u201cBut then I continued with it.\u201d</p> <p>TikTok is a curative to boredom: there is always a new challenge to try or dance routine to learn. \u201cTikTok is a space for the familiar play we\u2019ve seen on the internet for decades now,\u201d says Ryan Milner of the College of Charleston. \u201cChallenges that went around on YouTube or Facebook, like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/may/30/als-after-the-ice-bucket-challenge\">ice-bucket challenge</a> or the Kylie Jenner challenge, are now on TikTok.\u201d</p> <p>And although many TikTok videos may appear inane on first viewing, making a successful TikTok video takes skill, care and creativity. \u201cWhen you\u2019re writing the caption on TikTok, it really has to flow well and have the right syntax,\u201d Palmer says, \u201cbecause if it\u2019s too confusing people don\u2019t like it or ignore it. It has to flow really well.\u201d</p> <p>Leary reshot her most popular TikTok video \u2013 in which she pretends to DJ to the BBC News theme tune using household cleaning products \u2013 to improve her comic timing. \u201cI didn\u2019t instantly look at it and think, that\u2019s so funny,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo I refilmed it and the second time I took a swig of wine. That\u2019s the part of the video that people have found the funniest and commented on.\u201d Her instinct was correct: the video has received 151,000 likes and was played on the BBC.</p> <p>Another characteristic of TikTok that makes it well suited to the coronavirus lockdown: it is primarily an indoor platform. \u201cTikTok has always been about being 15 and staying at home,\u201d explains David Nichols of the University of Melbourne. \u201cThat\u2019s the accepted backdrop. And now everyone has to stay at home! So TikTok was made for coronavirus. Not deliberately, but it was.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike Instagram, where influencers swagger in front of a rotating backdrop of cocktail bars and tropical beaches, TikTokkers have always filmed themselves at home, in their bedrooms. \u201cInstagram is more for like going out and getting drunk or going on holiday,\u201d Palmer says. \u201cInstagram is superficial. But TikTok is just people posting stupid things and it\u2019s addictive, so you can keep going and going.\u201d</p> <p>Many of the young people I speak to say a variant of the same thing: TikTok used to be uncool, until suddenly it wasn\u2019t. Palmer tells me that his peers would often write \u201cHere as a joke\u201d on their TikTok bios, because they were embarrassed to be on the app. \u201cIf TikTok came up in conversation, everyone would say, \u2018Urgh, no one goes on that,\u2019\u201d says 16-year-old <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/nGjfv5/\">Libby Atkinson</a>, from Manchester.</p> <p>Coronavirus supercharged a process that was already taking place: the process of TikTok becoming cool. \u201cAll my friends are coming on it because they have nothing to do,\u201d says Atkinson. As a result, more young people are jumping ship, from Instagram to TikTok. \u201cEveryone is moving away from Instagram to TikTok,\u201d says Ali. \u201cIt\u2019s going to become the No 1 app that everyone is using.\u201d</p> <p>This exodus of Gen Z from Instagram to TikTok mirrors the way millennials dumped Facebook in the 2010s. \u201cApps are generational in a half-decade sense,\u201d says Milner. \u201cIt makes perfect sense that Gen Z would have their own platform and it would be TikTok. If you look at Instagram and everyone on it is aged 25 and older, you want to find your own place.\u201d</p> <p>Even as we abscond from Instagram in droves, TikTok would not exist without it. Milner says: \u201cSomething unique about TikTok is how much it is centred on the image of the creator and their physical body\u2026 That wouldn\u2019t have happened had Instagram not made us much more used to having our face and bodies being on camera.\u201d Instagram sandblasted away our self-consciousness: it made us comfortable with being on camera.</p> <p>Where 16-year-olds go, adults follow. Celebrities including <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/nGFEbf/\">Lizzo</a>, <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/nGBpRd/\">Britney Spears</a> and <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/nGYrat/\">Justin Bieber</a> have posted TikTok videos during the lockdown. Non-celebrities are also flooding the app: Leary\u2019s mum has become hooked on the platform. \u201cShe keeps telling me that she can\u2019t stop scrolling,\u201d Leary laughs. \u201cTikTok has made it into the mainstream now,\u201d says Nichols. \u201cIt\u2019s part of popular culture. A year ago, I\u2019d have to explain what TikTok was to adults.\u201d</p> <p>As TikTok grows up, it loses its countercultural edge. \u201cI discovered it through my daughter,\u201d explains Wendy Paintain, a 54-year-old from Lichfield. \u201cShe was throwing herself around the living room, in front of her phone. I thought, <em>what on earth is this rubbish? </em>I downloaded it to have a look. And then I thought, actually, it\u2019s quite entertaining.\u201d She lets rip a loud laugh.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Grandad Joe on TikTok\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tiktok-embed&quot; cite=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@grandadjoe1933/video/6806714661153557765&quot; data-video-id=&quot;6806714661153557765&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;&quot; &gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;@grandadjoe1933&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@grandadjoe1933&quot;&gt;@grandadjoe1933&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;very sad, we need to do better \ud83d\ude14. video creds @goubtube \ud83d\ude4c. &lt;a title=&quot;staysafe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/staysafe&quot;&gt;##staysafe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;selfisolation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/selfisolation&quot;&gt;##selfisolation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;wishmeluck&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/wishmeluck&quot;&gt;##wishmeluck&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;supermarket&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/supermarket&quot;&gt;##supermarket&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;considerothers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/considerothers&quot;&gt;##considerothers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;washyourhands&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/washyourhands&quot;&gt;##washyourhands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;\u266c If The World Was Ending - JP Saxe ft.

The <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/nGR6BN/\">Grandad Joe</a> account blew up after Paintain posted a video of Joe looking forlorn in a ransacked supermarket. It went viral, amassing 42.5m views.</p> <p>Since then, Joe has been accepted into the TikTok top creators programme, been invited for TV appearances and has even started to make money from brand partnerships. \u201cHe\u2019s grown really quickly,\u201d says Paintain of her father\u2019s TikTok account. \u201cHe got 1.6 million followers in nine weeks. He\u2019s even got a blue tick!\u201d (An indicator of a verified celebrity.) She takes me upstairs to speak to Joe, who is having a nap. \u201cI can\u2019t understand why it\u2019s so popular, really,\u201d Joe tells me. \u201cI\u2019m an old fossil. I guess I\u2019m having my 15 minutes of fame. Did you know that I might be going on the telly?\u201d</p> <p>Alongside these older content creators, official bodies have been using TikTok to publish public health information during the coronavirus pandemic. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has uploaded TikTok videos urging people to stay at home; the World Health Organization has 1.4 million followers on the app. During the Easter bank holiday weekend, when many feared people may break lockdown rules, due to the warm weather, the UK government ran ads on TikTok, asking people to stay at home.</p> <p>Coronavirus trends float through the app, like driftwood. There\u2019s the #iwillsurvivechallenge (where users wash their hands to the Gloria Gaynor anthem), and the #stayathomechallenge, where <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/nsEtDt/\">NHS workers</a> and TikTok creators urge users to stay indoors, sharing exercise routines or cooking tips to pass the time. (The #stayathomechallenge has more than 2.6bn views.) Bored in the House, the song by Tyga and up-and-coming rapper Curtis Roach, has become <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/BORED-IN-THE-HOUSE-6800281264655026950?lang=en\">TikTok\u2019s unofficial coronavirus anthem</a>: more than 2m videos have been created using the song, with more than 923 million views globally.</p> <p>All coronavirus content on TikTok has a banner linking to reputable news sources. The app\u2019s UK general manager, Richard Waterworth, says: \u201cWe [have] introduced a range of in-app features, notifications and safety measures specifically designed to elevate credible and accurate information from trusted sources.\u201d But preventing the spread of fake news can be difficult to enforce in practice: conspiracy theories linking 5G to coronavirus are easy to find.</p> <p>Healthcare workers have also turned to the app. \u201cTraditional TikTok was a dance platform,\u201d says NHS doctor and former <em>Love Island</em> contestant <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/nsvwyh/\">Alex George</a>. The 29-year-old has 104,000 followers on TikTok, where he posts videos explaining how coronavirus is transmitted or the correct way to wash your hands. \u201cBut that\u2019s not true any more. People are engaging with health content.\u201d</p> <p>Coronavirus has helped TikTok to grow up. What was once a platform for uninhibited free play, detached from the cares and concerns of the outside world, has become outward facing. Although this is not the first time that TikTokkers have been civic-minded \u2013 during the 2019 Australian bushfires, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/23/australian-teens-turn-to-tiktok-to-mock-pm-over-hawaii-holiday-during-fire-crisis\">users ridiculed Australian prime minister Scott Morrison\u2019s handling of the crisis</a> and raised money for affected communities \u2013 coronavirus has pushed TikTok into a new prominence. TikTok itself has pledged \u20ac62m to support European healthcare workers and communities affected by the pandemic.</p> <p>George is hopeful that his videos will communicate key public health messages to a younger audience. \u201cYoung people don\u2019t engage with traditional media forms,\u201d he says, \u201cbut they might watch my TikTok videos and educate their grandparents about how to wash their hands properly.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Alex George on TikTok\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tiktok-embed&quot; cite=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@lizzo/video/6816474944399101189&quot; data-video-id=&quot;6816474944399101189&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;&quot; &gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;@lizzo&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@lizzo&quot;&gt;@lizzo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Omg y\u2019all&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;\u266c original sound - jeanvictorm&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6812435361357171462&quot;&gt;\u266c original sound - jeanvictorm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@sorchamackenzie?lang=en\">Sorcha Mackenzie</a> joined TikTok long before coronavirus. She did so for the same reason many other people will be downloading it right now: because she was lonely.</p> <p>\u201cAt the time, I was pretty socially isolated,\u201d explains Mackenzie, a 28-year-old artist from Melbourne. \u201cI was running this gallery across town, in the docklands, and it\u2019s a pretty desolate area. Not many people come there. I would be there all day, until late at night, on my own every single day.\u201d She was rapidly hooked. \u201cIt made the world feel like a very big place,\u201d Mackenzie explains. \u201cYou feel interconnected.\u201d</p> <p>Mackenzie believes the new TikTok users are reaching out for the same thing she craved during her days in that abandoned Melbourne dockyard: a sense of community. \u201cIt makes perfect sense to me why TikTok has boomed and so many people have downloaded it at the moment,\u201d Mackenzie says. \u201cIt offers a salve to isolation.\u201d</p> <p>As the British public hunkers down at home, alone, in some cases literally returning to the bedrooms of its youth, TikTok connects us to an online community of people who are also muddling along as best as they can. \u201cIt feels like a safe place,\u201d says Atkinson. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re being judged.\u201d</p> <p>The sublime and the serious, the silly and the strange: TikTok is the perfect platform for these times. As the world changes, people who\u2019d never have dreamed of posting videos of themselves dancing in their pyjamas online or lip-syncing in their kitchen, think: why not?</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like such an uncomfortable, incredibly bizarre moment,\u201d says Mackenzie, \u201cand there\u2019s such a big shift in everything. People are forced to take stock of what is important. They lose that sense of ego or barrier of caring about what other people think about them.\u201d TikTok allows us to see others and be seen ourselves. It brings levity to otherwise dark and anxiety-filled days. It lets the air in.</p> <p>Layer by layer, the coronavirus pandemic has peeled away our braggadocio and our hubristic plans for the future and returned all of us to a childlike state. We sit at home, like children, and wait to be told what to do. And while we wait, we play online.</p>",
  "<p>Perhaps, the most surprising aspect of the British Covid-19 crisis is the extent to which the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments, and the English regions, have allowed strategy to be decided by Westminster.</p> <p>Health and social care are devolved, and this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/coronavirus-uk-how-many-confirmed-cases-are-there-in-my-area\">national epidemic </a>is not homogenous. It is made up of hundreds, if not thousands, of outbreaks around the country, each at a different stage . England had its first confirmed case on 30 January, Wales on 28 February and Scotland on 1 March. Some areas \u2013 such as Rutland, Hartlepool, Blackpool, Isle of Wight, Tyneside, Durham, Orkney, Western Isles \u2013 had no reported cases until late March, and some even now have relatively few cases.</p> <p>Contact tracing and testing, case finding, isolation and quarantine are classic public health measures for controlling communicable diseases. They require local teams on the ground, meticulously tracking cases and contacts to eliminate the reservoirs of infection. This approach is recommended by the WHO at all stages of the epidemic. It was painstakingly adopted in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/mass-testing-alerts-and-big-fines-the-strategies-used-in-asia-to-slow-coronavirus\">China, Singapore and Taiwan</a>, with a high percentage of close contacts identified and many housed in hotels. Germany has traced contacts throughout. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/leaked-cabinet-office-briefing-on-uk-pandemic-threat-the-key-points\">leaked UK national risk register</a> proposes it.</p> <p>Yet <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england\">Public Health England,</a> the agency responsible for communicable disease control in England, stopped contact tracing on 12 March, having reportedly only contacted 3,500 people, of whom about 105 were found to be positive. It\u2019s now about to resume. But why was it stopped, and how will it be resumed?</p> <p>We\u2019ve not seen an official explanation for its stopping. But lack of both resources and effectiveness are usually mentioned. Resources are essential, just as they have been for increasing acute care capacity, and the potential pool of contact tracers is vast. There are thousands of environmental health officers in local authorities and other sectors who have the necessary skills and experience. Singapore used its army. Teachers and barristers have volunteered in Ireland. Centralising control and management of the pandemic through NHS 111 has also left 7,500 GP practices underused, and the potential for real-time knowledge of new cases, results of swab tests and insight into the geography of spread has been lost. Yes, it\u2019s true that contact tracing is insufficient, but that\u2019s not the same as ineffective. It should have been supplemented, not replaced. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/coronavirus-under-control-in-germany-as-some-countries-plan-to-relax-lockdowns\">Look at Germany.</a></p> <p>We think there are more fundamental reasons. The system of local communicable disease control was established in the 19th century. After the NHS was set up in 1948, it was supported in England and Wales by national, regional and more than 40 local public health laboratories. But since local medical officers of health were abolished in 1974 \u2013 replaced by community physicians at different levels of the NHS \u2013 the system has been gradually but relentlessly eroded, fragmented and centralised.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s true contact tracing is insufficient, but that\u2019s not the same as ineffective. It should have been supplemented, not replaced</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Communicable disease control was centralised in the Health Protection Agency in 2003, and local public health laboratories transferred to NHS hospitals. Public health was then carved out of the NHS in England in the 2012 Health and Social Care Act, which abolished local area health bodies, created Public Health England to fulfil the government\u2019s duty to protect the public from disease and charged local authorities with improving public health \u2013 but with limited proactive scope for infectious disease control and woefully inadequate resources.</p> <p>Then came austerity. Local authorities suffered a 49.1% real terms reduction in central government funding from 2010 to 2018. Numbers of community control teams and consultants in communicable disease control have decreased. PHE made \u201csavings\u201d of \u00a3500m over five years in the name of \u201cefficiency\u201d and now has nine regional \u201chubs\u201d serving 343 English local authority areas.</p> <p>With further waves of the epidemic likely, resumption of contact tracing is critical. Each of the four nations needs to institute scores of locally led, nationally coordinated and funded teams to trace, find and test contacts. Caernarfon isn\u2019t Cardiff, Gairloch isn\u2019t Glasgow, London isn\u2019t Lulworth. Teams in England and Northern Ireland would be based in local authorities; in Wales and Scotland they would be in local health boards. Their composition should be locally determined, drawing on a range of expertise, especially among directors of public health, field epidemiologists, environmental health officers, GPs, local NHS laboratories, NHS 111 and test centres, plus volunteers if required.</p> <p>Widely used apps with robust data protection could play a supportive, but not framing, role. In addition, the apparently strategy-free <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-testing-to-be-offered-to-england-key-workers-and-families\">plans for 50 mass drive-in test centres</a> need to be decisively directed to support local contact tracing, as well as strategically targeting the most at-risk groups.</p> <p>We would expect rigorous implementation of these measures now to make an overdue but significant contribution to controlling the epidemic. Restoring and updating local communicable disease control is an integral part of properly funded, publicly provided health and social care.</p> <p><em>Allyson M Pollock, professor of public health, Newcastle University, and<br>barrister Peter Roderick, principal research associate, Newcastle University</em></p>",

Several told the <em>Observer</em> they wanted tests as much for their patients, or the people they worked and lived with, as for themselves. Many had signed up in the small hours, including a school key worker who had gone online at 2am to register.</p> \n<p>\u201cI work around Covid patients, although we wear full PPE,\u201d said one nurse who asked not to be named. \u201cThis is the first opportunity we\u2019ve had to get tested. It\u2019s for my patients as well as myself, so I don\u2019t risk infecting them.\u201d She had travelled with her sister who works in care, and her parents who are isolating with them. Their father\u2019s diabetes makes him a high risk if he contracts Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Once inside the car park the symptom carriers were directed into one of five bays, and greeted by a worker in full protective equipment, holding up a mobile phone number to ring from inside the car.

Before attending, she said it would be \u201cvery scary\u201d because she hadn\u2019t left the house since 4 January when she got back from holiday incredibly ill. \u201cActually, going into the outside world is something that gives me a high level of anxiety, so going 22 miles makes it worse,\u201d she added.</p> \n<p>When Mitchell arrived at the testing site at Worcester Warriors rugby club just before 3pm on Saturday, she was told that there would be a two and a half hour wait \u2013 but the centre would shut at 5pm regardless.

Milton Keynes has one of the biggest labs in the country, based at the<a href=\"https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/uk-biocentre-2/\"> UK Biocentre</a>, just a few miles from the car park test centre, which handles swabs sent from at least 20 testing centres across the country.</p> \n<p>The labs are largely manned by scientists who volunteered to step away from their usual research to carry out testing, which is labour-intensive work.</p> \n<p>At Milton Keynes, the scientists operate in pairs working 12-hour shifts, and together can handle around 400 to 500 swabs a day. The lab\u2019s daily capacity, at full stretch, is around 8,000 tests.</p> \n<p>Inside the lab there are three work stations, the first of which is protected by a biosecurity hood, where samples are treated with a solution to kill everything inside. In the second, the virus\u2019s genetic material (or the material of anything picked up by the sample) is extracted. In the third, that genetic material is put through a machine that multiplies it, so that there is enough for the test to detect, then checked for coronavirus. The biggest challenge, experts say, is not the science but the logistics of getting the tests in, then scaling up and bringing in robots.</p> \n<p>The Milton Keynes lab is part of a centralised approach to testing in the UK that has puzzled many scientists and may have been a key contributor to the slowincrease of testing capacity.</p> \n<p>Other countries that have rolled out more rapid testing programmes have relied at least in part on letting existing labs become testing centres with their own teams and equipment, who are able to start testing almost immediately on site.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c05ac5d1537c13ecc40c1c46ddaa339971772f2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c05ac5d1537c13ecc40c1c46ddaa339971772f2/0_99_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Technicians carry out a sample transfer during the opening of the new Covid-19 testing lab at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Technicians carry out a sample transfer during the opening of the new Covid-19 testing lab at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow last week.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WPA/Getty</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the UK, by contrast, authorities have chosen to bring equipment and scientists together in government-established centres, which are slower to get going because logistics and supply issues need to be worked out.</p> \n<p>Prof Allyson Pollock, of Newcastle University, says one of the many reasons the UK\u2019s reaction has been late and, until now at least, fairly ineffective is that it can no longer respond to local need, because of endless reorganisations and years of austerity. She also says the government is treating this pandemic as a national one, when actually it is a series of local ones, requiring dedicated local responses.</p> \n<p>But what angers scientists, health workers, experts and others more is why it was left until so recently \u2013 when Hancock was already admitting the peak was near \u2013 for this mass process of testing and contact tracing to be ordered across the country. And why has it all seemed so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/06/uk-missed-coronavirus-contact-tracing-opportunity-experts-say\">chaotic and poorly planned</a>?</p> \n<p>The criticism of ministers and their advisers is all the greater because they know the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/31/two-people-in-britain-test-positive-for-coronavirus\">started on the right road</a> only to halt, change course, then resume when the virus had spread and all that could be achieved was damage limitation.</p> \n<p>In early March, during the \u201ccontainment phase\u201d, Public Health England (PHE) began testing and contact tracing of the few cases identified. Just under 300 staff were hired at that time. The team, working around the clock, traced 3,500 people and supported the 3% of contacts found to be infected to self-isolate. But tracing was then scaled back when the UK moved to the \u201cdelay phase\u201d.</p> \n<p>Governments that have contained larger scale outbreaks once they are under way, perhaps <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/test-trace-contain-how-south-korea-flattened-its-coronavirus-curve\">most notably South Korea</a>, which at one point was the worst affected country outside China, have done it through large-scale testing and rigorous tracing of the contacts of infected people.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe fact is that the UK was not able to operate a testing and tracing campaign like the one used in South Korea,\u2019 says Prof James Naismith, of Edinburgh University. \u201cWe, like many countries, did not have the infrastructure in place to maintain a testing programme in the first wave. South Korea - and Germany - did. However, as with being on the Titanic after it hit the iceberg, there is no time for recriminations, we need to act now to save lives. While we have lagged behind in testing and tracing, if we focus we can catch up.\u201d</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>After the UK stopped its testing and contact tracing, the World Health Organization ordered all countries to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/16/test-test-test-who-calls-for-more-coronavirus-testing-video\">test, test, test</a>\u201d. But in a vital period last month, the UK resisted. Only recently, as pressure to limit the lockdown has grown from businesses, Conservative MPs and a frustrated public, and as Hancock\u2019s testing target looked in danger, has the government completely changed course.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c89ca9ae45963ef0f8b0510eeeb95a0f9bfcd88\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c89ca9ae45963ef0f8b0510eeeb95a0f9bfcd88/0_7_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers direct cars at a coronavirus testing site in a car park at Chessington World of Adventures, south-west London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Workers direct cars at a coronavirus testing site in a car park at Chessington World of Adventures, south-west London.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There is dismay among health workers who see daily the effects of Covid-19, that early efforts to \u201cramp up\u201d testing (before key workers were included from last Thursday) were suboptimal to say the least.</p> \n<p>Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said: \u201cThere has been a lot of zig-zagging and veering on what is the policy, who is responsible for mobilising it, what is the plan.\u201d When Hancock first announced his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/matt-hancock-sets-target-of-100000-coronavirus-tests-a-day\">target of 100,000 tests a day</a> she says no one really knew how it would work. \u201cIn our view it was not clear. It was just a number that was put out there.\u201d Cordery says it is not clear who the 100,000 should be initially, nor who would be involved in the testing. Should those to be tested include NHS staff, patients, who? </p> \n<p>This lack of action was irksome for scientists, who last week pointed to the UK\u2019s massive but ignored capacity for carrying out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/the-two-tests-that-will-help-to-predict-spread-of-covid-19\">genetic testing</a>. Medical virology, molecular cancer and regional genetic laboratories as well as other academic centres around the country routinely use PCR [polymerase chain reaction] technology, which could easily have been turned to Covid-19 work a long time ago, they say.</p> \n<p>\u201cOnly the US has a greater capacity to do testing,\u201d said ProfGerome Breen, of King\u2019s College London. \u201cBut the NHS has refused to reply to many offers of help from research centres to supply tests.\u201d One of these offers came from Breen, a geneticist whose department already carries out PCR testing on a large scale. \u201cA month ago we offered to turn our laboratory over to Covid-19 work and test medical staff at King\u2019s College Hospital to find out who might have been infected with the virus. We could have started within a fortnight and would have been doing thousands of tests a day by now. We had a couple of emails from the department but heard nothing from them after that. It was intensely frustrating.\u201d</p> \n<p>Prof Martin Marshall, the chairman of the Royal College of GPs, suggested GPs should have been able to play a bigger role in referring patients for testing and helping the testing process. This admittedly would have required them to have the correct PPE, which has proved another challenge altogether.</p> \n<p>\u201cHave they been a bit slow in getting to general practice, understanding the needs of general practice, understanding the PPE needs, for example, which took a time, understanding the role of general practice in identifying vulnerable patients understanding the testing needs for general practice? I think all of that has been slower than we would have liked to see.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked if the government knew who it ought to be testing, he said: \u201cI think the testing programme has been influenced more by the politics of the availability of testing than it has by the epidemiology of what\u2019s required.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou can have a good policy on testing, but you can only deliver it if you\u2019ve actually got the kit.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"69bc2609-b61f-4a43-a042-0af3c62f3de7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3GqhApWmFtA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>This weekend, with the UK passing 20,000 hospital deaths from Covid-19 , and the WHO insisting that testing and contact tracing is essential before life can go back to normal, both are suddenly back at the heart of government policy.</p> \n<p>But have the U-turns and the delays cost? And what if the lockdown has to continue for months more because effective testing and contact tracing has not been put in place?</p> \n<p>Already business leaders and Conservative MPs are beginning to warn that without an <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52389967\">easing of the lockdown</a> based on testing and contact tracing, the economy faces ruin. Last week, the crisis facing small businesses and the need for a balance to be struck between saving lives and saving the economy was raised in a heated, virtual meeting of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers.</p> \n<p>The former cabinet minister, David Davis, said: \u201cThere is deep concern among backbenchers about the fate of the vast numbers of small businesses, which will determine how fast we come out of this economic slump. Unless we are very quick and very effective at bringing as many as possible back into work in a few weeks\u2019 time, the scars of this problem will go on for a decade.\u201d</p> \n<p>Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee, said: \u201cAll members of parliament must be receiving representations from businesses large and small needing further assistance or some sense of when they can start to plan for at least a partial release from these measures.\u201d</p> \n<p>Charles Walker, the committee\u2019s vice-chair, added: \u201cOur inboxes are full of desperate people who own small businesses, some of which are their lives\u2019 work, who now risk losing everything. We need to have a cabinet minister put in charge of small business.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"77142d5a-0bf3-4a80-b538-c47a11b57f6a\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>People over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, according to new guidance from the World Health Organization, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask.</p>\n    <p>The WHO guidance, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation.

He said studies of infected hospital patients in Wuhan, in China, where Covid-19 first emerged, indicated that around 40% had contracted the disease inside the hospital. \u201cHospital transmission is a very likely source of ongoing Covid-19 infection in the middle of a lockdown,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>For some patients \u2013 for instance, those with life-threatening cancers \u2013 this is a very serious issue. \u201cPatients are avoiding going to their GPs and GPs are making fewer hospital referrals. There are also 200,000 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/coronavirus-crisis-is-stopping-vital-cancer-care-doctors-say\">fewer cancer screenings</a> taking place each week in the UK, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. That, in turn, means there are approximately 2,000 to 2,500 cancer diagnoses being missed each week.\u201d</p> \n<p>Many scientists now believe reliable testing on a large scale really does offer the UK a route out of its Covid-19 crisis. However, merely reaching a figure of 100,000 tests a day on its own is not enough, warned Naismith.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt won\u2019t matter if we can test numbers of that order if we cannot then rapidly trace the contacts of those who are found to be positive and then isolate them. Once a person is found to be positive we will have to trace their contacts very, very quickly \u2013 within a day \u2013 and then test them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Such tracing will inevitably require technological aids \u2013 mainly by using mobile phones to track a person\u2019s movements, said Naismith. \u201cInevitably, that will have privacy issues,\u201d he added. \u201cHowever, these will have to be dealt with because testing and tracing offers us the best chance we have for dealing with Covid-19 at the moment.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 April 2020 to correct a quote from James Naismith.</p>",
  "<p>Last week, in Oxford, the first volunteers in the first European human trial were injected with a potential <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/the-hunt-for-a-coronavirus-vaccine-a-perilous-and-uncertain-path\">coronavirus vaccine</a>. At the same time, Pakistan\u2019s National Institute of Health <a href=\"https://www.dawn.com/news/1551432\">received an offer</a> from the Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinopharm International Corp to take part in a trial of another potential coronavirus vaccine.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/25/africas-covid-19-research-must-be-tailored-to-its-realities-by-its-own-scientists\">Africa's Covid-19 research must be tailored to its realities \u2013 by its own scientists | Monique Wasunna</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The two events reveal twin aspects of the global process of drug trials and development. On the one hand, there is the ingenuity and drive that allow a potential vaccine to emerge in a fraction of the time it would normally take, as well as the courage and selflessness shown by the volunteers risking their health to test it. On the other, the increasing use of poorer nations as testing grounds for new medicines, in trials in which the subjects often have, because of poverty and lack of access to health provision, little choice about whether to take part.</p> <p>The details of the proposed Chinese trial are still unclear, but it is part of what many call the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd2441\">\u201cglobalisation of clinical trials\u201d</a>. Until the end of the last century, virtually all clinical trials by western pharmaceutical companies were conducted in Europe or America. The majority still are. But over the past 20 years, US, European and, increasingly, Chinese companies have taken to offshoring trials to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4428044/#b2\">low- and middle-income countries</a>. In 2017, 90% of new drugs approved by the US Food and Drugs Agency <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2017/09/08/clinical-trials-overseas-data/\">were tested</a> at least in part outside the US and Canada. At a time when so much attention -and hope - is focused on the possibilities of a Covid-19 vaccine, it\u2019s worth reminding ourselves of what the development of medicines means for most of the world.</p> <p>The reasons for conducting tests offshore are not hard to discern. In lower income countries, regulation is looser, staff cheaper and subjects easier to find, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41591-019-00008-7\">cutting costs</a> by 30-40%.</p> <p> Take India. It has a huge population, enormous levels of poverty, almost 20% of the global disease burden and a pitiable health infrastructure. It also has highly trained scientists and medics, skilled technicians and good laboratories. As a result, in the first decade of this century, India became the poor country of choice for many pharmaceutical companies. The proportion of <a href=\"http://isid.org.in/pdf/WP179.pdf\">global clinical trials</a> conducted in India rose from less than 1% in 2008 to 5% six years later \u2013 just about on par with the UK.</p> <p>The globalisation of clinical research has many potential benefits. It could help tackle diseases long ignored, develop medical and scientific innovation in non-western countries, improve their health infrastructure and increase the diversity of trial subjects and thereby the quality of the final product. In reality, too little of this has happened because offshore clinical trials have at their heart not a concern for the welfare of subjects or the health of local populations but the need to cut costs and generate profits.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In India, many poor people were recruited to HIV trials without knowing that they were taking part in experiments</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ethical guidelines for clinical research normally require participating patients to have access to the best available treatments for their condition. But in poor countries, the fact that people are poor has often been an excuse for researchers brushing aside such considerations.</p> <p>A particularly egregious case was in the treatment of HIV in the 1990s. The standard care at that time to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV was a course of the drug AZT. The drug was expensive, so researchers wanted to see if other treatments might work.</p> <p>In the west, the control group in such trials would have received the normal course of AZT. In a series of trials in Africa and Asia, however, the control group received not AZT but a placebo, on the grounds that poor people would normally not have received treatment anyway. Hundreds of babies were born infected with Aids when they might have been free of the virus. As <a href=\"http://soniashah.com/books/the-body-hunters/\">Sonia Shah</a> wrote in her book <em>The Body Hunters</em>: \u201cRather than working to overcome the inevitable barriers of poverty and inequity, many Aids researchers felt compelled to accommodate them.\u201d Too often, that remains the case.</p> <p>In India, many poor people were <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-20136654\">recruited to trials</a> without knowing that they were taking part in experiments. Thousands died<strong>, </strong> though as no proper records were kept the true figure is unknown<strong>.</strong> Government data indicate <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5553263/\">2,868 deaths</a> between 2005 and 2012 and a <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h6149\">further 2,209</a> between 2013 and 2015; <a href=\"https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/news/11550-over-24000-clinical-trial-deaths-and-saes-india-ten-years\">others sugges</a>t the total might be much higher. The scandals, court rulings and parliamentary scrutiny led to a tightening of regulations. This in turn led to pharmaceutical companies <a href=\"https://www.livemint.com/science/health/india-losing-out-on-clinical-trials-raises-health-worries-1551115944303.html\">pulling out of India</a>, forcing the government to <a href=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/4238150/PharmOlam_March2018/PDF/pharm-olam_india_clinical_trials_white_paper_1.pdf?t=1524594556831\">loosen regulations</a> once more.</p> <p>Equally troubling is that clinical trials in poor countries rarely address local health problems. Every year, infectious diseases take a devastating toll in India: 440,000 people die annually from TB. To put that in perspective, more than <a href=\"https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases\">190,000 peopl</a>e have died globally so far from Covid-19. Yet just <a href=\"http://isid.org.in/pdf/WP179.pdf\">0.7% of clinical trials</a> in India target TB. Among children, the biggest killers are diarrhoeal diseases; fewer than 1% of trials concern gastrointestinal infections.</p> <p>More than 12% of Indian clinical trials are, on the other hand, designed to find cures for cancer. That\u2019s half as many again as the total number of trials targeting all infectious diseases. Indeed, there are more trials in India investigating skin problems, including for the development of cosmetics, than for infectious diseases. Cancers and skin problems are important to tackle, but these are conditions that more afflict rich nations \u2013 and the rich in India. The issues that primarily affect the poor still remain largely ignored. Globally, diseases of relevance to high-income countries are investigated in clinical trials <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)61046-6/fulltext\">seven to eight times more often</a> than diseases whose burden lies mainly in low- and middle-income countries.</p> <p>There is little profit in tackling TB or diarrhoea. There are large bounties in cures for cancers or improvements in cosmetics. And so the bodies of the wretchedly poor become exploited to alleviate the ailments of the comfortably rich.</p> <p>This year or next, we will, it\u2019s hoped, find a vaccine for Covid-19. Once the pandemic is brought to an end, there will still be millions in the global south dying for want of basic medicines and research. Will we take their lives as seriously as we are taking the lives of those devastated by coronavirus? Will we rethink the way that clinical research is conducted and what its priorities should be? Or will we continue to ignore the poor and persist in allowing profit to take precedence over people?</p> <p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",
  "<p>There have not been too many encouraging graph lines in recent weeks. One that does offer a breath of optimism, however, is the slight downward curve that implies one of the most toxic trends of our times \u2013 the anti-vaxx movement \u2013 might just be in retreat. The shift is incremental, but in a UK-wide survey in mid-March, 7% of people insisted they would refuse to have a coronavirus vaccine if one were available. By early April, with hospital wards and mortuaries filling up, that number had dropped to 5%. Perhaps vaccine conspiracy cannot bear too much pandemic reality.</p> <p>As with the strategies against the virus itself, however, the response to any likely \u201ccure\u201d seems likely to vary from country to country. A similar survey in France, also conducted by the London-based <a href=\"https://www.vaccineconfidence.org/\">Vaccine Confidence Project</a>, suggested 18% of people would refuse a vaccine, while in a poll in New York, the city worst affected by the pandemic, 29% insisted they would not consent, a number that may render any programme ineffective.</p> <p>The depth of misplaced fear about vaccination \u2013 which remains one of the unambiguous triumphs of global public health \u2013 has been further illustrated in widely shared remarks from lockdown. Novak Djokovic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/19/novak-djokovic-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccination-tennis\">last week volunteered</a> that he would have to think seriously about whether he could even carry on playing tennis if a vaccine were to become mandatory to travel. The rapper MIA went further in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/22/mia-claims-british-vogue-pulled-article-about-her-over-anti-vax-comments\">informing her 650,000 Twitter followers</a> melodramatically, that \u201cif I have to choose the vaccine or a [location-tracking] chip, I\u2019m gonna choose death\u201d.</p> <p>The most prominent American anti-vaxxer, Robert Kennedy Jr, meanwhile, amplified an unhinged conspiracy that believes Bill Gates is using the virus as part of a supposed plot to control the world\u2019s population through immunisation.</p> <p>All pandemics trail a ready market in superstition, quackery and prejudice \u2013 a sense of powerlessness generates in some the need for catch-all theories, however deranged. At the time of the great plague in London, the spread of miracle cures and scapegoating prophecy was almost harder to contain than the infection itself. As part of its strategy the government was moved, <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/376/376-h/376-h.htm\">Daniel Defoe reported</a> in his <em>A Journal of the Plague Year</em>, to \u201csuppress the printing of such Books and Pamphlets as terrify the People\u201d. The efforts to prevent the spread of damaging conspiracies across our own media have shared a similar profile \u2013 and often a similar success rate \u2013 to the efforts to curb the disease.</p> <p>In this respect, the pandemic is something of a test case for the social media monopolies of Silicon Valley to deliver on their widely trumpeted commitment to slow the spread of dangerously false information. After being confronted with the evidence of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/10/facebook-fake-news-election-conspiracy-theories\">manipulation in the elections of 2016</a>, and the spread of such vile conspiracies as that which argued that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/31/alex-jones-pay-sandy-hook-conspiracy-theory\">Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax</a>, Facebook and Google and the rest have been forced to step up efforts to monitor and block extreme misinformation campaigns on their various platforms. Arguably, that effort is finally starting to show some effect.</p> <p>Counterintuitively, some evidence for that might be found in the response to the most pernicious of the current conspiracies which has, entirely without scientific foundation, sought to link the spread of coronavirus with the rollout of the 5G data network. The real-world effects have been the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/04/uk-phone-masts-attacked-amid-5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory\">acts of vandalism and arson</a> against mobile phone masts in the past weeks. Up to 50 such attacks have been reported, mostly on Merseyside and in the West Midlands, including the burning of the 5G mast adjacent to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/14/arsonists-attack-phone-mast-serving-nhs-nightingale-hospital\">new Nightingale hospital</a> outside Birmingham.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7f04146b7f7c20d9d8156d5698993736094abca3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f04146b7f7c20d9d8156d5698993736094abca3/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eamonn Holmes on This Morning\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This Morning received more than 400 complaints after presenter Eamonn Holmes gave credence to Covid-19 5G conspiracy theories.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV This Morning</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A report from the independent verification charity Full Fact <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/online/5g-and-coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-came/\">last week revealed</a> how this copycat campaign was only the most dramatic expression of a conspiracy theory with different strains, which include \u201cthat all the symptoms [of the virus] are actually caused by 5G\u2026 [and] that there is no disease at all, and the outbreak is a gigantic hoax to enable the government to install 5G under the cover of lockdown\u201d. It should go without saying that there is no possible connection between the 5G radio waves and the spread of a virus. Even so, the government was forced to address the fears, calling them \u201cdangerous nonsense\u201d.</p> <p> Thinking about contagious ideas now, I recall <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/mar/12/scienceandnature.features1\">interviewing Daniel Dennett</a>, the philosopher of evolution, back in 2006, just before the launch of Twitter. Dennett was talking excitedly of a word that he and Richard Dawkins had coined to describe how Darwinist idea-germs could be sent into battle against the politicised viruses of creationism. He called these idea-germs \u201cmemes\u201d. Nah, I thought at the time; it will never catch on.</p> <p>In the 14 years since, it has become second nature to trace the originators of particularly incendiary memes. <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory\">A story in </a><em><a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory\">Wired </a></em><a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory\">magazine</a> located the origin of the 5G conspiracy in an interview of 22 January in a Belgian newspaper with Kris Van Kerckhoven, a general practitioner from Putte, near Antwerp. He was quoted as saying that \u201c5G is life-threatening\u201d, but then added a speculative comment (\u201cI have not done a fact-check\u201d) that linked that falsehood to the virus then confined to China. The \u201clink\u201d became an ill-advised clickbait headline. (The piece, in <em>Het Laatste Nieuws</em>, was subsequently withdrawn.)</p> <p>If these words marked the moment when the 5G conspiracy established its RNA, however, the \u201cwet market\u201d for those ideas to jump species and spread human to human was a conference given on 11 March at the Health and Human Rights Summit, in Tucson, Arizona. The headline act was the original anti-vaxxer Andrew Wakefield, the discredited English doctor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/may/24/mmr-doctor-andrew-wakefield-struck-off\">who was struck off</a> by the GMC after being shown to have deliberately falsified evidence to make bogus claims of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Wakefield was in this case upstaged by a Californian, Thomas Cowan, author of <em>Cancer and the New Biology of Water</em>, who is serving a five-year suspension from medical practice for prescribing unlicensed drugs to cancer patients. Cowan claimed, entirely falsely, that Covid-19 was caused by electromagnetic waves and, also incorrectly, that Wuhan, where it originated, had been the guinea-pig city for 5G.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/04/uk-phone-masts-attacked-amid-5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory\">UK phone masts attacked amid 5G-coronavirus conspiracy theory</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Videos of this talk were viewed 1.8 million times on YouTube and widely shared on Facebook before the sites moved to take the posts down.</p> <p>In their book <em>A Lot of People Are Saying</em>, their study of conspiracism in the Trump era, Russell Muirhead and Nancy Rosenblum classify people such as Cowan as \u201cconspiracy entrepreneurs\u201d.

  "<p>When coronavirus emerged in China, people across much of the region were quick to start wearing some form of face mask when they went out in public. Memories of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/apr/21/china.sars\">Sars epidemic</a> were still strong, and there is a <a href=\"https://qz.com/299003/a-quick-history-of-why-asians-wear-surgical-masks-in-public/\">cultural tradition of wearing masks </a>to protect oneself and others.</p> \n<p>In the west, however, even though masks sold out as fast as hand sanitiser in chemists and online as people stockpiled supplies, initially there was widespread reluctance to wearing face coverings in public.</p> \n<p>The divide was so strong that, as racism against people of east Asian heritage rose sharply, some <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronavirus/Asians-in-US-torn-between-safety-and-stigma-over-face-masks\">stopped wearing masks</a> because face protection had become a focus for abuse, discrimination and stigma.</p> \n<p>A few weeks later, masks and improvised substitutes are rapidly becoming the new normal in cities from New York to Berlin, and those who go out without their nose and mouth covered risk censure or stronger penalties.</p> \n<p>Millions of people are even learning how to create their own as they wait for supplies to return to stores around the world.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/facemask-zip/giv-3902CN5iba3GbXmu/\" data-alt=\"make your own mask\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/facemask-zip/giv-3902CN5iba3GbXmu/\">make your own mask</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Take up has been slow because, for months, scientists and authorities were divided on whether they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/face-masks-coronavirus-covid-19-public\">help slow the spread of the disease</a>. The World Health Organization today still recommends their use by anyone coughing or sneezing, but says healthy people should <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks\">use them only</a> if taking care of someone infected with the coronavirus.</p> \n<p>It seems increasingly likely that where masks do provide a benefit outside a surgical setting, it is for society as a whole, not the individual wearing it. Rather than preventing the wearer picking up an infection, they may be more likely to prevent carriers of the virus from passing it on, whether through coughs, sneezing, during conversation or even while yawning.</p> \n<p>There are concerns that masks may give a false sense of security, as they do not block all particles, and leave the eyes uncovered and open to infection.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5d25beb5-14fb-47b4-bd06-0714dbfabc04\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cqLnDhHSJDU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But as the coronavirus crisis drags on, and governments look for ways out of economically devastating lockdowns, they are unlikely to vanish any time soon. Here are how different countries have regulated mask supplies and mask-wearing as they battle coronavirus.</p> \n<p><strong>Czech Republic</strong></p> \n<p>The Czech Republic was the first country in Europe to make face covering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/czechs-get-to-work-making-masks-after-government-decree-coronavirus\">mandatory in public</a>, with a decree in mid-March. In an effort to set a public example, the prime minister, Andrej Babi\u0161, and other politicians have addressed parliament and made television appearances wearing masks. The government claimed the policy helped slow the spread of the disease, and bring the outbreak under control with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/czechs-grapple-with-how-to-ease-covid-19-lockdown\">relatively low casualty numbers.</a></p> \n<p><strong>Taiwan</strong></p> \n<p>Anticipating high demand, Taiwan started rationing masks in January, giving everyone a weekly allowance they could buy at designated pharmacies. The country also invested millions in creating new mask manufacturing capacity, expanding so much that there is a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chowleen/status/1252798444244254721?s=20\">quota for Taiwanese living abroad</a>, and started <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/taiwan-donate-ten-million-masks-172312113.html\">donating masks</a> to some coronavirus hotspots.</p> \n<p>There is no legal obligation to wear a mask, but because of the experience of living through the Sars epidemic, people are used to wearing them in crowded places.</p> \n<p><strong>Germany</strong></p> \n<p>On 15 April, Angela Merkel recommended people wear masks, and since then all 16 German states have made it mandatory on public transport and while shopping. Masks can also include any kind of face covering, such as scarves or bandanas. However, most cities have said they won\u2019t actually enforce the rules or issue fines, because they don\u2019t have enough staff.</p> \n<p>The eastern city of Jena was the first to make mask-wearing mandatory and had a very positive response. The mayor, Christian Gerlitz, said that \u201c99% of the population sticks to the rules\u201d.</p> \n<p><strong>Spain</strong></p> \n<p>Masks are not required, but the government advises people to wear them on public transport and in situations where social distancing is difficult, and started handing them out when it loosened the restrictions on non-essential workers. There have also been problems with supply; defective masks from a Chinese company have resulted in 1,000 health workers requiring isolation over fears they may have been infected with the virus.</p> \n<p><strong>United States</strong></p> \n<p>In early April, America\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reversed months of official insistence that healthy people did not need to wear masks, and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html\">recommended everyone wear non-medical face coverings in public.</a> A national shortage of masks means it is almost impossible to buy them, and this has sparked an interest in sewing across the country as people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/06/how-to-make-no-sew-face-mask-coronavirus\">try to make their own instead.</a></p> \n<p>President Donald Trump said the guidelines were voluntary, and he would not cover his face, although his wife Melania <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/09/politics/melania-trump-face-mask-coronavirus/index.html\">shared a photo of herself wearing a mask</a>, and encouraged others to do so. Other officials have warned that the face coverings must not replace hand washing and social distancing.</p> \n<p><strong>Japan</strong></p> \n<p>Mask-wearing is common in Japan, but as the country stepped up its battle against the pandemic, it announced early this month that it would supply every household with two washable, reusable masks at a cost to the nation of \u00a3350m. That effort has been marred by complaints about mould, insects and stains, with the government forced to replace some of the face coverings, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-japan-masks-idUSL3N2CA10N\">Reuters reported.</a> Electronics company Sharp has halted online sales of masks until further notice, after its website crashed due to overwhelming demand.</p> \n<p><strong>Hong Kong</strong></p> \n<p>Masks have been worn in public by the majority of the population in Hong Kong since the epidemic began. Their use has been supported, but not mandated, by the government. There have been some tensions over the reluctance of many in the city\u2019s large expat community <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3076796/coronavirus-exposes-cultural-divide-hong-kong\">to cover their faces</a>, and some health experts are now calling for covering up to be made compulsory.</p> \n<p>Despite efforts to tackle the virus, authorities have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/hong-kong-court-upholds-face-masks-ban-despite-coronavirus\">doubled down on an \u201canti-mask ban\u201d</a> brought in last year to try to halt the city\u2019s months-long protest movement.</p> \n<p><br></p>",
  "<p>Boris Johnson must extend the UK\u2019s transition out of the EU for up to two years to avoid compounding the economic damage of the coronavirus pandemic with a hugely disruptive and disorderly Brexit, according to a close ally of Angela Merkel.</p> <p>In an interview with the <em>Observer</em>, Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, chair of the Bundestag\u2019s foreign affairs committee, said it was now impossible to see how the UK and other EU countries could agree even a minimal outline free trade agreement this year because the talks were so behind schedule.</p> <p>The transition period is due to end on 31 December unless the UK asks for a prolongation by 30 June. The maximum extension would be two years, under the terms of the withdrawal agreement. R\u00f6ttgen said he could not see any sensible option other than for the UK to apply for the extension to avoid even more damage to the British and European economies. On Friday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/24/britain-running-down-the-clock-in-brexit-talks-says-michel-barnier-eu\">Michel Barnier</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/24/britain-running-down-the-clock-in-brexit-talks-says-michel-barnier-eu\"> said there had been \u201climited progress\u201d</a> in the initial stages of \u201cvirtual\u201d negotiations, which he said was disappointing.</p> <p>R\u00f6ttgen, a member of Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union party, said: \u201cBefore the current coronavirus crisis, I think it would have been possible to have a minimum agreement with the UK on the broad outlines to avoid a crash [the UK crashing out with no deal], with more detailed negotiations then taking place afterwards.<br><br>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine now that this is possible, given the fact that all the EU countries, Brussels and London are so absorbed by the pandemic \u2013 and this will go on.

To think that you could then add to this extraordinary situation a very disorderly exit, to me is not imaginable. I think everyone will say that this is not in the British interest or in the interest of any of us.\u201d</p> <p>The Brexit transition began when the UK left the EU on 31 January. The arrangement \u2013 under which the UK is outside the EU but continues to be subject to its rules and a member of the single market and <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/customs-union\">customs union</a> \u2013 was negotiated by both sides to smooth the UK\u2019s exit.</p> <p>The transition was also designed to allow the UK to continue much of its previous relationship with the EU while the fine details of a future trading relationship and <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/negotiating-brexit-policing-and-criminal-justice\">security co-operation</a> were negotiated.</p> <p>Barnier cited an alarming lack of progress in four of the most crucial areas of the talks. Sources said he was greatly frustrated that the UK did not appear ready either to discuss detail or make compromises.</p> <p>The four areas of difference were the so-called \u201clevel playing field\u201d (the extent to which the UK would adopt EU standards to have access to the single market); fisheries, particularly EU access to UK waters; security co-operation and governance issues.</p> <p>The German MEP David McAllister, who chairs the UK co-ordination in the European Parliament (correct) said both sides were now \u201cunder enormous time pressure to organise a half-way orderly exit of the UK from the single market and the customs union.\u201d</p> <p>It had been hoped that an outline deal could be concluded over the coming months, in time for it to be signed off over the summer by EU leaders. But talks between the UK and EU sides are well behind schedule, although the second set of discussions, effected by video link, ended last week.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think there is a recognition by some of the UK side that they will have to extend but no one knows how to do it</p> <footer> <cite>Senior EU politician</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>EU officials have said that concluding deals on such complex issues \u2013 already a lengthy and tortuous process \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/24/who-and-what-uk-and-eu-resume-interupted-brexit-talks-future-relationaship\">is far more difficult without face-to-face meetings</a>. One high-level EU source said: \u201cYou can get so far but what you can\u2019t do is go away into small groups of six or eight people in a dark room and hammer out the final, vital details. That is not possible in a virtual meeting.\u201d</p> <p>The UK is also understood to have redeployed some of its staff who were posted to the EU trade talks to coronavirus duties since the Covid-19 pandemic developed.</p> <p>The issue of whether to apply for an extension is now emerging as a huge additional problem for Johnson, who prides himself on having \u201cgot Brexit done\u201d. Until now, Downing Street has said it will not contemplate asking the EU for an extension under any circumstances.</p> <p>To do so, Johnson would have to reverse legislation that, in effect, bars him from seeking an extension, and he would have to agree additional financial contributions to the EU to pay for that extension.</p> <p>Another senior EU politician involved in the talks said there were signs of division appearing on the UK side, with some civil servants and Tory MPs believing the UK had to find a way to abandon its opposition to extending the transition: \u201cI think there is a recognition by some on the UK side that they have to extend but no one knows how to do it. The question is what Johnson will decide when he returns to Downing Street after his illness.

EU lawyers say that once that window is missed, EU law makes it very difficult to agree to any extension.</p> <p>Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, who is regularly in touch with diplomats in EU capitals, said: \u201cIt will be very hard for both sides to reach the outlines of a free trade agreement by autumn, or indeed by June, which is when the PM wants to take a decision on whether it is worth pursuing a free trade agreement.</p> <p>\u201cLast week should have been the fifth round of negotiations, but it was the second. The bottom line is that on both sides the top politicians\u2019 attention is focused on coronavirus, not Brexit, which makes a deal in the short term highly unlikely.\u201d</p>",

His fascinating body of work is the best record we have of the city from that period. </p> <p>The second is <strong>Ed van der Elsken </strong>(1925-1990), a street photographer and film-maker. He is best-known for Love on the Leftbank, his photobook of Paris, but he also took great portraits of 1950s Amsterdam. Martin Parr is a big fan. Breitner and Elsken are the two best guides you could have to the streets of Amsterdam.</p> <h2>Film</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3__3R2R2RMU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3__3R2R2RMU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>My Rembrandt trailer</figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>My Rembrandt</strong>, a 2019 documentary by Oeke Hoogendijk, is a fascinating story about various people and their relationship with the artist.

There is a traditional Dutch cuisine, but it isn\u2019t too famous for a reason! One of the few traditional Dutch dishes we cook in my house is a kind of comfort food called <em><strong>stamppot</strong></em>. You boil potatoes with one or more other vegetables (carrots, endive, kale, onions), then drain, add hot milk and mash. We serve it with smoked sausage and pickles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e3877a5e3cd1e8840bc655fbc1121ccd08cb720\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e3877a5e3cd1e8840bc655fbc1121ccd08cb720/0_149_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dutch stamppot - mashed potatoes and vegetables with sausages\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dutch stamppot - mashed potatoes and vegetables with sausages.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sergii Koval/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We drink a lot of beer in the Netherlands, so visit virtually with a Dutch beer. Heineken is the most famous, but there are lots of small breweries in Amsterdam, such as <strong><a href=\"https://www.brouwerijhetij.nl/home_en/?lang=en\">Brouwerij \u2019t Ij</a></strong>. We also like making home brew \u2013 a good activity during lockdown. And <em><strong>jenever</strong></em>, Dutch gin, is having a revival among young people. They drink it neat, but it\u2019s strong, so you should eat something with it! It goes well with beef sausages, cheese and mustard.</p> <p> </p>",
  "<p>The 2016 election left the US gaping at a brewing battle between the president-elect and the most senior members of the law enforcement and intelligence communities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/05/front-row-at-the-trump-show-review-jonathan-karl\">Front Row at the Trump Show review: Jonathan Karl's pre-pandemic warning</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Into the conflagration jumped Virgil, a pseudonymous contributor to Breitbart, who wrote of a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/12/12/virgil-the-deep-state-vs-donald-trump/\">deep state</a>\u201d within the US government, bolstered by the mainstream media and a \u201cgalaxy of contractors, profiteers, supporters\u201d, all purportedly intent on destroying Donald Trump.</p> <p>His near-4,000 word essay appeared weeks before the FBI director, James Comey, briefed the president-elect about the Steele dossier, on 5 January 2017, before 11 January when Trump compared America\u2019s intelligence agencies to Adolf Hitler\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/819164172781060096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2017%2F01%2F11%2Ftrump-melts-down-on-twitter-are-we-living-in-nazi-germany.html\">Gestapo</a>. For Trump and his minions, Virgil\u2019s take became a touchstone.</p> <p>Enter the New Yorker\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/david-rohde\">David Rohde</a>. Under the subtitle \u201cThe FBI, the CIA, and the Truth About America\u2019s \u2018Deep State\u2019\u201d, the two-time Pulitzer-winner rejects the nomenclature of conspiracy theorists. In doing so he relies in part on Will Hurd, a moderate Republican congressman from Texas who served overseas with the CIA, opposed impeachment and is not seeking re-election.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump placing his hand on the shoulder of an FBI director and whispering into his ear is the stuff of Scorsese\u2019s films</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But Rohde does little to dispel the notion that government is riddled with entrenched interests, and that career officials can find themselves at odds with incumbent presidents and vice versa. In Rohde\u2019s view, civil servants are part of \u201c\u2018institutional government\u2019\u201d, a relatively benign term that masks turf fights, budget battles, policy skirmishes, built-in biases and well-formed points of view. The left has frequently derided the military industrial complex. Name-calling plays both ways.</p> <p>Rohde acknowledges that \u201call countries have permanent governments\u201d, but says the US imposes greater political control over its employees and the resultant process. Even so, campaign finance records reflect that the federal bureaucracy is not a Republican bastion.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-taxonomy-of-scandals-is-obama-nearing-a-breaking-point\">Going back in time</a>, in 2012 Internal Revenue Service employees donated to Barack Obama over Mitt Romney by a 4\u20131 ratio while lawyers at the National Labor Relations Board and the education department <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-age-of-obama-a-strong-government-and-a-weak-america\">shut out Romney completely</a>. In 2020, Joe Biden is outpacing Trump at the IRS and the justice department, as Hillary Clinton did in 2016.</p> <p>Of course, who joins the federal government is not necessarily in sync with who prevails on election day. But the Trump presidency appears unique and disheartening. The fight between the president and law enforcement and intelligence was an avoidable consequence of Russia\u2019s \u201cactive measures\u201d <a href=\"https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report_Volume4.pdf\">in support of the Trump campaign</a>, and a candidate all too willing to accept the sordid bounty.</p> <p>\u201cI love WikiLeaks\u201d was bound to gain attention. And as Rohde makes clear, Trump has waged a persistent assault upon the rule of law, the ideal of a justice department removed from politics and the concept of an intelligence community loyal to the country rather than the man in the Oval Office.</p> <p>A recent Senate intelligence committee report <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/us/politics/russian-interference-senate-intelligence-report.html\">observed</a> that the intelligence community has \u201cpresent[ed] a coherent and well-constructed intelligence basis for the case of unprecedented Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election\u201d. As Robert Mueller reminded us, absence of indictment was not akin to prosecutorial absolution, despite what <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/01/20/william-barr-trumps-sword-and-shield\">the attorney </a><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/01/20/william-barr-trumps-sword-and-shield\">general, William Barr</a>, may have thought and said.</p> <p>On that score, <a href=\"https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/6805-judge-walton-ruling-on-barr-cr/2df9b5c6d7de0fef1e35/optimized/full.pdf#page=1\">in an opinion issued last month</a> Reggie Walton, a George W Bush appointee to the federal bench, \u201cseriously\u201d questioned Barr\u2019s integrity and credibility, using words like \u201cdistorted\u201d and \u201cmisleading\u201d to drive the point home.</p> <p>Suffice to say, all this is coming with a steep cost to our democracy and our post-Watergate system, which sought to make law enforcement something other than the handmaiden of the White House.

Except life is very much allowing it and my brain is very much not.</p> <p>The zapping of our concentration and attention spans may seem anecdotal, but there is substantial neuroscience to explain it. Living through a pandemic plugged with sadness, fear and uncertainty is a mind soup designed to tip us <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/anxiety-on-rise-due-to-coronavirus-say-mental-health-charities\">off balance</a>.

Getting frustrated because I can\u2019t find comfort in fiction is wildly wasted energy and yet it didn\u2019t stop me from spending a whole day taking all my books off the shelves and re-ordering them, hoping I\u2019d trick myself into reading again.

Honestly, how did I resist?)</p> <p><a href=\"https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/kate-mclaughlin\">Katie Ann McLaughlin</a>, a clinical psychologist and Harvard professor, smiled when I told her about my unrelaxing methods to try to relax. The only way to regain focus, she said, is to actually relax: breathing exercises and mindfulness are mentioned as scientifically proved ways to buffer stress. Doing good for others also ranks high.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a limited capacity system; we don\u2019t have enormous bandwidth to cope with all the channels competing for attentional resources,\u201d she told me. \u201cStress saps you. An increase in stress can age your working memory by a decade.\u201d Terrifying, but not necessarily permanent. McLaughlin described what plenty of us are going through as ego depletion \u2013 ego in the psychological, not everyday sense \u2013 where the resources needed for willpower and self-control to concentrate on anything but, say, all nine seasons of the US version of <em>The</em> <em>Office</em>, are severely limited.

  "<p>Barbara Parry* arranged to switch her phone and broadband account from Sky to Now TV in March, a week before lockdown. Instead, she was left incommunicado as her line was cancelled and her phone number reallocated.</p> <p>During the following four weeks, as she pleaded in vain to be reconnected, her partner contracted Covid-19. He died four days later in hospital. Due to the blunders by Now TV, he was unable to call Parry from his deathbed and she was unable to say goodbye. The news was broken by a relative as the hospital could not get through on her cancelled number.</p> <p>\u201cNow TV\u2019s failed promises have left a 79-year-old woman, grieving for a lost loved one, completely on her own, with friends and family unable to contact her,\u201d says her son-in-law, Anthony. \u201cThe day after her partner died, the company reneged on a promise to retrieve her old number and said it was not possible. Instead of promised call backs, we\u2019ve had auto-generated emails asking why we cancelled the contract and I\u2019ve spent over seven fruitless hours on the phone explaining it was a life-and-death situation and trying to get her connected.\u201d</p> <p>Coronavirus has turned telecoms into a lifeline. Service delays that would once have been an inconvenience can now prove catastrophic. Figures from the Office of National Statistics show that 77% of people cited phone and internet contact as the most common coping strategy.</p> <p>However, service providers are struggling with some companies losing up to 40% of staff to sickness and self-isolation.</p> <p>Ofcom, which regulates the industry, has eased some of the obligations of telecoms firms to reflect the challenges. They are absolved from having to fix problems within the usual 30-day window for customers receiving less than their guaranteed broadband speed and automatic compensation, introduced last year for each day of delay to a repair or installation. Companies are expected to explain to customers why they will not receive a payout and to stop charging those without a service.</p> <p>\u201cBroadband and mobile firms are focusing their efforts on keeping their customers connected, particularly those who are vulnerable and depend on their services the most,\u201d Ofcom says. \u201cWe think this is absolutely the right approach. And we recognise this might affect the companies\u2019 ability to comply with some of our rules. We have written to the providers explaining that we will take account of the unique circumstances when enforcing our rules.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the current climate we are both classed as extremely vulnerable but in an emergency have no means of contacting anyone</p> <footer> <cite>Colin Noddings</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The problem is that customers with mental or physical impairments had to be registered as vulnerable with their service providers in order to be prioritised before the pandemic. Now anyone self-isolating due to age or a medical condition falls into that category, but may not be flagged up on their provider\u2019s database.</p> <p>Pensioners Colin and Anne Noddings* found that their landline had been disconnected after Vodafone installed a broadband service. They were told it would take 10 days to restore and Colin had to borrow mobile phones from neighbours to call for updates.</p> <p>Three days later, the couple was informed that their contract had been cancelled for reasons unknown and the phone number they\u2019d had for 30 years, withdrawn. It would take an estimated 15 days to reconnect them.</p> <p>\u201cMy 73-year-old wife is classed as disabled as her mobility is extremely limited and I have a heart condition, diabetes and have recently been diagnosed with asthma and COPD,\u201d says Colin. \u201cIn the current climate we are both classed as extremely vulnerable but in an emergency have no means of contacting anyone.\u201d</p> <p>Ofcom says it expects companies to provide self-isolating customers alternative means of communication if their issue can\u2019t be prioritised. However, Vodafone only acted when the <em>Observer </em>intervened. It reinstated the line and the original number 13 days after the couple were disconnected and has given them \u00a350 and two months free line rental.</p> <p>Charlotte Hughes* lost her internet connection in January after a cable to her flat was severed. Virgin Media claimed it was unable to reconnect her because of scaffolding on the council block where she lives. The inconvenience for the first two months, when lack of wifi impeded her search for a job, turned to hardship when lockdown began a week after she underwent surgery for cancer. She was unable to order food online and had to risk trips to the supermarket, despite an NHS letter requiring her to shield, and she was unable to seek comfort from friends and family.</p> <p>\u201cSkype is the main way I connect, and I simply cannot say what it meant not to have a reliable enough connection to talk to people,\u201d she says. \u201cThis was especially difficult at a time of diagnosis and pre- and post-operative treatment for cancer. I was told that the cable had been severed by a Virgin Media technician connecting a neighbouring flat, but the company displays no sense of urgency or responsibility and clearly has no reliable mechanism for communicating between departments or flagging up unresolved problems.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve never been more reliant on broadband and mobile phone networks, but our data suggests some firms are falling short</p> <footer> <cite>Martyn James, Resolver</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Virgin Media says that it believed the cable was severed by builders, and that health and safety risks prevented it reinstating the line while scaffolding was in place. After involvement from the <em>Observer</em>, however, it dispatched a \u201cspecialist crew\u201d and completed the repair. It has credited Hughes\u2019 account for the 11 weeks she was without service and given her an extra two months free.</p> <p>The online resolution service Resolver reports a doubling of complaints about telecoms service issues since lockdown. \u201cMost people are pragmatic enough to expect service disruptions and slow speeds, but they weren\u2019t expecting poor customer service,\u201d says spokesperson Martyn James. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been more reliant on broadband and mobile phone networks, but our data suggests some firms are falling short.\u201d</p> <p>Customers who are self-isolating or in financial straits are advised to contact their provider to receive priority status. If that fails, they can still complain to whichever of the two dispute resolution schemes it\u2019s signed up to \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.cisas.org.uk/\">CISAS</a> or <a href=\"https://www.ombudsman-services.org\">Ombudsman Services</a>. These are prioritising those who are left without a connection because of delayed installation, a faulty line or inability to pay their bill. Other complaints will be parked until there is a degree of normality.</p> <p>Parry\u2019s ordeal was caused by disjointed customer service and a failure to escalate the problem. When the <em>Observer</em> alerted the management of Now TV, part of Sky Group, the response was immediate and remorseful. The director of operations called her to apologise, her old phone number was retrieved and her line connected.</p> <p>Managing Director, Marina Storti, says: \u201cWe take our responsibility to keep customers informed and connected very seriously, especially in these challenging times, and we know we\u2019ve let the customer and her family down. We\u2019ve spoken to the family and while we know that no amount of money can make things right, we have met the request of compensation and offered to match it with a donation to a charity of their choice.\u201d</p> <p>The company\u2019s contrition is some mollification, but the anguish of losing a loved-one without a farewell will never heal. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to put into words how much greater the misery has been because of the mistakes,\u201d Parry says.</p> <p>\u201cThey let me down in the first place and they let me down again when we tried to sort it out. I\u2019m a Christian and I believe in forgiveness but this is very tough for me.\u201d</p> <p><em>* Names have been changed</em></p>",

  "<p>Social distancing is saving lives every day. But the physical and psychological toll of the lockdown is not spread evenly among us. Care home residents, prisoners and children in the care of the state are just some of those whose health and wellbeing have been disproportionately endangered for the common good. And the enforced social isolation of a lockdown is a particularly terrifying prospect for victims of domestic abuse and their offspring.</p> <p>Abusers so often rely on isolating their victims from friends, family and colleagues in order to prolong and worsen the impact of their abuse. The lockdown has aided and abetted them in their mission to terrorise. Around 6% of adults <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/crime/are-third-domestic-abuse-victims-men/\">report having experienced domestic abuse in the last year</a>, the overwhelming majority of them women; <a href=\"https://www.refuge.org.uk/our-work/forms-of-violence-and-abuse/domestic-violence/domestic-violence-the-facts/\">two women a week</a> are killed by a current or former partner. Since social distancing restrictions came into force last month, there are alarming signs that domestic abuse has surged; the National Domestic Abuse helpline has seen <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52157620\">a 25% increase</a> in calls, and the <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-4-000-domestic-abuse-arrests-in-london-in-just-six-weeks-police-say-11978358\">Metropolitan police have reported a 2</a><a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-4-000-domestic-abuse-arrests-in-london-in-just-six-weeks-police-say-11978358\">4% increase</a> in charges and cautions for domestic abuse. The pandemic also makes it more difficult for women to access help: not just because they may be constantly monitored at home, but because <a href=\"https://safelives.org.uk/sites/default/files/resources/SafeLives%20survey%20of%20frontline%20domestic%20abuse%20organisations%20for%20COVID-19%2030.03.20_0.pdf\">three quarters of domestic abuse services</a> have reported having to reduce their services, because of staff self-isolating and social distancing requirements.</p> <p>This week, the long-delayed domestic abuse bill will return to parliament for its second reading. It comprises some welcome measures, including the creation of a statutory definition of domestic abuse, which includes emotional, coercive and economic abuse as well as physical violence, and the legal establishment of a domestic abuse commissioner. But it goes nowhere near far enough in tackling the hurt that is going on behind closed doors.</p> <p>The nature of domestic abuse means that properly addressing and preventing it is relatively resource intensive: it is not simply a matter of removing a woman and her children from an unsafe situation. Domestic abuse survivors need ongoing support \u2013 first, to be able to leave their abuser, and then to process the trauma that years of damage can inflict. Evidence-based perpetrator programmes are required to reduce the risk of them reoffending, either with their former partner or a new one. None of that comes cheap.</p> <p>Yet the bill provides nowhere near the level of resourcing that is needed to keep women safe. Like all locally funded services, those for domestic abuse have faced significant funding cuts over the last decade. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/housing-secretary-confirms-new-support-for-survivors-of-domestic-violence\">extra funding</a> announced by government in February for refuge services will not fill the gap \u2013 the number of refuge spaces in the UK is almost a third lower <a href=\"https://1q7dqy2unor827bqjls0c4rn-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Domestic-Abuse-Report-2020-The-Annual-Audit.pdf\">than that recommended by the Council of Europe</a> \u2013 and there has been no extra funding allocated for community services, which are accessed by most domestic abuse survivors. While the legislation would give the police greater powers to enforce domestic abuse protection orders, the government is planning no resources or training for already stretched law forces.</p> <p>The bill also does nothing to recognise that the government is complicit in the abuse of migrant women through its hostile environment policies. Many have no recourse to public funds and so are unable to access statutory support, leaving them trapped in life-threatening situations. Abused women whose migrant status is insecure are put off from seeking help from the police because it can result in their deportation and separation from their children; too often abusers know this and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/03/domestic-abuse-laws-to-be-brought-back-before-parliament\">use it as yet another weapon of intimidation</a>. All victims of domestic abuse and their children should be entitled to support, regardless of their immigration status.</p> <p>The cost of properly resourcing domestic abuse services pales in comparison to its huge societal cost, which the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-economic-and-social-costs-of-domestic-abuse\">government estimates at \u00a366bn</a> a year. It is small change compared with the vast sums that have been rightly found to protect the economy through the pandemic. For abuse victims and their children, the lockdown has only tightened the security of the domestic prisons in which they are trapped. Yet they continue to fall through the cracks of the government\u2019s Covid-19 response.</p>",

The Germans, who will hold the EU council presidency from July, have already indicated as much. Berlin\u2019s focus, rightly, will be on Europe\u2019s reconstruction, not <a href=\"https://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/corona-krise-deutscher-eu-botschafter-schreibt-brandbrief-ans-kanzleramt-a-90f62ece-5cdf-4a92-b720-16c051660ccb\">Britain\u2019s self-destruction</a>.</p> <p>Uncomfortable fact 2: Britain\u2019s negotiating positions are inflexible to the point of obtuseness. Barnier singled out fisheries. But there are deep differences across the board. The EU\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/24/britain-running-down-the-clock-in-brexit-talks-says-michel-barnier-eu\">chief negotiator complained</a> Britain was dragging its feet, pointing out that doing so made the December deadline even less practical. The very real possibility that Johnson actually has no coherent plan at all does not appear to have occurred to Barnier. He should consider it.</p> <p>Uncomfortable fact 3: a no-deal crash looms large because there is almost certainly not enough time to achieve the most rudimentary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/brexit-uk-plan-to-secure-trade-deal-by-december-is-fantasy-says-eu\">bare-bones free trade</a> agreement, if one were on offer, or even to fully implement last year\u2019s withdrawal agreement. Any transition extension must be agreed by 30 June. After that, in EU and British law, there is no going back. The chasm beckons.</p> <p>This is not a policy - it is a charlatan\u2019s farce. These are not the acts of responsible, sensible political leaders. Brexit was always a largely delusional, dishonest project. Now it is entering the realms of fantasy and nightmare. By persisting as though nothing has changed, Johnson, Dominic Raab and the rest risk untold additional damage to a country already desperately struggling to survive the pandemic.</p> <p>Given the disaster that has befallen us all, the only rational course is to swiftly apply for a Brexit extension of at least one year and preferably two, agree additional budget contributions and actively cooperate with the EU on measures to rebuild a pan-European economy that remains vital for UK prosperity.</p> <p>It\u2019s plain, despite the denials, that Brexiters\u2019 disdain for such cooperation lay behind the lethal failure to join an EU purchasing scheme for protective clothing and ventilators. It is also of great concern that Johnson\u2019s hard Brexit guru, Dominic Cummings, is attending meetings of the government\u2019s scientific advisory group, Sage. His presence undoubtedly pollutes discussions that are supposedly strictly non-political. Here is further evidence of Brexit blight.</p> <p>There are hints in Whitehall that <a href=\"https://www.cityam.com/exclusive-growing-divide-in-boris-johnsons-brexit-unit-over-trade-deal-extension/\">more grounded Tories</a> understand that continued intransigence over an extension cannot be sustained. It should be evident to even the most ideologically obsessed that taking back control cannot mean kicking away yet more human, economic and social props as the national edifice trembles and people suffer and die. This is plain common sense.</p> <p>Johnson must decide and quickly. Once he re-enters politics after his illness, he should level with the country. Even though he doesn\u2019t want to, Johnson needs to talk about Brexit \u2013 and why the current timetable must change. Brexit isn\u2019t done.</p>",

  "<p>When Marama Davidson, ahead of an official trip to New Zealand\u2019s Hawkes Bay, found out that low-income families living in motels there would be evicted to make way for visiting dignitaries like her, she refused to be part of it.</p> <p>After Davidson \u2013 co-leader of the left-leaning Green party that is part of New Zealand\u2019s power-sharing government led by Jacinda Ardern\u2019s Labour \u2013 saw the headlines, she cancelled the booking and packed a tent in her suitcase instead.</p> <p>\u201cThey were kicking people out of motels that were being used for emergency housing,\u201d she says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, I hate that we\u2019ve got people living in motels, but I don\u2019t want to be the reason for them to live in the car for a week.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Davidson had an even better time at the campground during the trip to visit the M\u0101ori performing arts festival Te Matatini, she says. The young performers and their families were staying there too; she fixed her hair and makeup for official events in the communal bathroom block alongside them and \u201cwas stealing all their babies\u201d while groups rehearsed.</p> <p>\u201cCamping is my deal,\u201d Davidson, 46, says. So are the arts; her father is the actor Rawiri Paratene and her mother an activist; she was raised at the heart of a kind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/28/google-disney-maori-new-zealand\">M\u0101ori cultural renaissance</a> \u2013 political, linguistic, creative \u2013 with some of New Zealand\u2019s most towering Indigenous writers, artists and agitators as her doting babysitters. Leadership was natural; parliamentary politics was not.</p> <p>When the Guardian visited her office in the capital, Wellington, in February \u2013 before parliament closed for the national lockdown intended to eliminate Covid-19 from New Zealand \u2013 Davidson was barefoot and dispensing hugs to anyone who arrived.</p> <p>There is tension between her idealism and her pragmatism in the story about sleeping in a tent while on official business. \u201cI understand that we need to solve the systemic issue and me camping for two nights does not solve the systemic issue,\u201d she says. \u201cI got all that.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/22/flattening-curve-new-zealand-coronavirus\">Crunching the coronavirus curve is better than flattening it, as New Zealand is showing | Devi Sridhar</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is also reflective of the Greens\u2019 uneasy relationship with power: the party of activists and environmentalists returned its best electoral results while in opposition against the previous centre-right government, and the current electoral term is the first time the party \u2013 with its eight parliamentarians \u2013 has been part of the ruling group.</p> <p>But the trade-off for the discomfort, Davidson says, are policies such as the one she was shortly to announce: a plan to reduce the housing agency\u2019s reliance on motel rooms for emergency accommodation for the homeless, and to build more short-term housing for those on New Zealand\u2019s longest-ever public housing waiting list, at a cost of $300m.</p> <p>\u201cEssentially, we are operating in a system which goes against our values,\u201d she says of the Green party.

That will be the pitch for the Green party at September\u2019s election, Davidson says: telling stories about what its lawmakers did when they touched the levers of power.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d5687919d93c959047036d40d8956328378b07f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d5687919d93c959047036d40d8956328378b07f/0_0_5400_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marama Davidson talks to Jacinda Ardern during debate over the zero carbon bill last year\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marama Davidson talks to Jacinda Ardern during debate over the zero carbon bill last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hagen Hopkins/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She mentions bolstered protections for victims of domestic abuse, safeguards for water and the environment, collective M\u0101ori approaches to Indigenous matters.

Two other adult children live nearby. Davidson is working \u201c14 to 16 hour\u201d days in politics, representing the Green party on a parliamentary committee set up to scrutinise the government\u2019s response to the virus. She seeks refuge from the chaos in the garage, or with her laptop balanced atop a stack of books on two bar stools in the bedroom.</p> <p>\u201cOn the one hand I\u2019ve been able to put my children to bed every night and that has been an absolute luxury for me,\u201d she says, adding that in order to spend time with her family in the evenings, she is often still working at 2am.</p> <p>Politics is emphatically not \u201cfor life\u201d for Davidson, but her husband and children agreed that the chance to lead a political party was worth the sacrifice.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Do the work.

Her point about the difficulties of survival on welfare in New Zealand was drowned out by rancour over her wrongdoing, but Davidson says Turei\u2019s \u201cbravery\u201d had \u201cchanged the narrative\u201d about poverty in New Zealand.</p> <p>Journalists who ask her about welfare payment increases these days, she says, are on the side of the beneficiaries. But when Davidson learned the woman who mentored her into politics was stepping aside less than two months before the 2017 election , she had \u201ca very raw moment of grief and feeling quite bewildered as to whether I could carry on\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe way I reconciled it was: \u2018Do the work. Get it done,\u2019\u201d she recalls. She cried in her car outside a campaign event. Less than a year later, she was the party\u2019s co-leader.</p> <p>Before Turei had urged her into politics, Davidson worked at New Zealand\u2019s human rights commission for a decade. Her penchant for activism, combined with an absence of ministerial portfolios allows Davidson more flexibility to petition the government than she might otherwise have.</p> <p>Her best-known stand came as an opposition MP when she was thrown out of parliament for objecting to the then-prime minister John Key\u2019s accusation that his opponents supported \u201crapists.\u201d She stood in the debating chamber and referred to her own sexual assault; the demand that she leave prompted a walk-out in support from other lawmakers, many of whom said they had been assaulted too.</p> <p>She spoke further about the abuse, which had happened when she was a young child, on a news podcast in 2018. It generated a huge outpouring \u2013 talkback callers, messages, headlines \u2013 of support and recognition.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to affect you until you see it in broad daylight out in the world,\u201d Davidson says, of sharing the story. \u201cAnd then I saw I saw it all around the place and then I was like, \u2018What have I done?
