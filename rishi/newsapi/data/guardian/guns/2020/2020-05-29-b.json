He didn\u2019t want to tell his dad what happened. It took him months to tell a friend, a fellow altar server.</p> <p>Together they confided in a priest named Jack Niland.</p> <p>\u201cWell boys,\u201d the priest allegedly replied. \u201cPriesthood is a lonely life.\u201d (Niland is now the subject of multiple sexual abuse lawsuits. He died in 2009.)</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until 2015 that Denton realised his childhood trauma wasn\u2019t an isolated incident. Back on Guam, he overheard a cousin talking with a friend about how Apuron had sexual relations with seminarians. Denton says hearing that made him so angry, and he blurted out that Apuron had raped him.</p> <p>Later that year, he wrote a letter to the Vatican detailing his alleged rape. In 2016, he described his trauma at a press conference on Guam. His was among a series of public announcements organised by local critics of the archbishop who had convinced Denton and others to speak up against Apuron, then one of the most powerful people on Guam.</p> <p>Though Denton didn\u2019t realise it at the time, his allegation would help set off a chain of events that has revealed hundreds of sexual abuse cases across multiple decades on Guam and forced the church there to declare bankruptcy, shaking the foundations of a community deeply rooted in the Catholic religion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40da2a22a7625cf29d2de12bc0ab186a637c45ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40da2a22a7625cf29d2de12bc0ab186a637c45ac/0_0_1920_1280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The annual fiesta mass at Our Lady of Purification church in Maina, Guam.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The annual fiesta mass at Our Lady of Purification church in Maina, Guam.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken San Nicolas/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the time Denton went public, levying such accusations against a priest on Guam was almost unthinkable. But in the four years since, these allegations have formed a steady drumbeat in the backdrop of everyday life on the western Pacific island. Nearly 300 sexual abuse lawsuits have been filed against nearly two dozen priests on the island, and while local newspapers still regularly publish stories detailing new accusations they\u2019re now so familiar they no longer make the front page.</p> <p>After Denton and others came forward in 2016, Apuron forcefully denied the allegations and left the island. Guam\u2019s legislature removed the statute of limitations for child sex abuse cases, just a few years after rejecting similar legislation.</p> <p>No criminal charges have been brought against Apuron, but the Vatican held a canonical trail and ultimately exiled Apuron from Guam, stripping him of his title as archbishop. Pope Francis denied the priest\u2019s appeal of that decision, securing Apuron\u2019s banishment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e5fdbe89d2bd2de0b43f6bc661dbab2e9c4f017\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e5fdbe89d2bd2de0b43f6bc661dbab2e9c4f017/1343_1332_3592_2395/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A poster of Pope Francis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A poster of Pope Francis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Apuron, who still receives a $1,500 monthly stipend from the church, is now the subject of multiple civil lawsuits alleging sex abuse and has not returned to Guam. His attorney declined to comment for this story.</p> <p>Roy Quintanilla, who spoke out with Denton against Apuron in 2016, says he never imagined the settlement talks would drag out for so long. \u201cI know that this is taking a toll on the people of Guam and it\u2019s just so sad,\u201d says Quintanilla, who now lives in Las Vegas but follows the news developments closely.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes I think \u2014\u201d he pauses, and then continues slowly. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that I did the right thing, that\u2019s for sure, because I think it needed to be said. I just didn\u2019t realise the impact on the community.\u201d</p> <h2>Brouillard, the predator</h2> <p>More than half of the total cases against the church related to one priest: Louis Brouillard, a priest from Minnesota who served from 1948 until 1981, teaching at an all-boys Catholic school and working as a Boy Scouts of America scout leader.</p> <p>He is now the target of more than 150 sexual abuse lawsuits on Guam. After settling several lawsuits related to Brouillard, the Boy Scouts declared bankruptcy last month.</p> <p>The cases against Brouillard describe how he lured and cajoled children, threatening, photographing and molesting them. One case filed against the priest as recently as mid-February describes how he victimised a child who was left homeless after a typhoon.</p> <p>\u201cAt that time, when I was that age, I got the impression that kids liked it, so I went ahead,\u201d Brouillard told the Associated Press in 2016. He didn\u2019t know how many children he abused.</p> <p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe 20.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"4169ec8e689168ff100a871df10e641c824d0e96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4169ec8e689168ff100a871df10e641c824d0e96/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Our Lady of Mt Carmel Church, in Agat, Guam.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Our Lady of Mt Carmel Church, in Agat, Guam.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken San Nicolas/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brouillard, who died in 2018, was never prosecuted for his offences, because the statute of limitations for child molestation was two years. He said that other members of the church knew about his abuse but did not tell him to stop, instead telling him to pray.</p> <p>Emmanuel Cruz was a teenager living in the village of Mangilao when he says the priest came to his house and asked his parents if he could take Cruz to his office and talk about religion. Instead, Cruz alleges Brouillard asked him about his dating life and asked Cruz to take off his clothes and allow Brouillard to photograph the boy naked. That\u2019s when the priest measured his penis, Cruz says.</p> <p>Cruz hasn\u2019t filed a lawsuit; compared with the other allegations against the priest, he says he feels his experience wasn\u2019t so bad. Still, the shame made him keep it a secret for decades.</p> <p>At age 71, he\u2019s only now talking about his experience because he wants people to know that the people filing lawsuits are telling the truth. He suspects there are a lot of people like him who aren\u2019t going to court.</p> <p>Cruz still goes to church, and says now that Brouillard is dead, God will be the ultimate judge. \u201cWhat do they say? God rest his soul,\u201d he says.</p> <h2>A devout community</h2> <p>Benjamin Cruz, no relation to Emmanuel, understands why it took sexual abuse survivors on Guam so long to speak up.</p> <p>The former Guam lawmaker was behind an unsuccessful effort to temporarily lift the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse on Guam back in 2011. He remembers how Apuron persuaded his colleagues to dilute the bill until it was essentially meaningless.</p> <p>Cruz also understands the shame associated with sexual abuse \u2014 he says he himself was victimised by a priest in California when he was growing up, although he never filed a lawsuit.</p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t only shame that kept sexual abuse survivors on Guam from speaking out. Many feared their parents and grandparents were so devoted to the church that they wouldn\u2019t believe them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aa9df22c7f4fb4e15c93cd30f3236516a144ec37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa9df22c7f4fb4e15c93cd30f3236516a144ec37/0_0_1920_1280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The annual fiesta mass at Our Lady of Purification church in Maina, Guam.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The annual fiesta mass at Our Lady of Purification church in Maina, Guam.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken San Nicolas/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The western Pacific island is a US territory home to the indigenous CHamoru people, most of whom are Catholic.

The property has a sweeping view of the village and the shimmering ocean. It is also one of the properties that could potentially be up for sale to resolve the lawsuits, for an estimated $2.5m. Faced with mounting lawsuits, the Archdiocese of Aga\u00f1a declared bankruptcy last year.</p> <p>When Byrnes arrived on Guam, the church was in turmoil.

But European diplomats said the US was half-hearted in its campaign and lost the tussle with China.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting, looking at the last WHA meeting for me, was a very clear sign that American influence has diminished significantly,\u201d said Abraham Denmark, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence for East Asia. \u201cIt was embarrassing that we weren\u2019t able to wrangle international support for our policy goals in that meeting, and that China was able to really get what they needed out of that.\u201d</p> \n<p>The move appeared to confirm the suspicions of many in the WHO and in western capitals that Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/us-gives-g7-countries-a-list-of-reforms-it-wants-who-to-undertake\">never intended to seek reforms or open a dialogue with the WHO</a>, but left the body for political reasons.

  "<p>Yes, on its own, the olfactory experience of fish sauce might remind you of standing in the middle of pungent, damp fish market, knee deep in fishy detritus.

It is not being taken through the menu details blow by blow \u2013 it comes in the form of a little dish filled with freshly chopped birds eye chillies, immersed in fish sauce, which arrives at your table before your food is served.

But its inclusion is often unknowable. Unless you are a well-versed home cook or chef, the thing that makes a dish taste amazing can\u2019t quite be placed.</p> <p>If your heritage means you grew up eating food where fish sauce is a ubiquitous ingredient, you probably have the proclivity to souse nearly everything savoury with it.&nbsp;</p> <p>I grew up thinking fried eggs came complete with fish sauce, the lacy fried whites and creamy half-cooked yolks were the perfect vehicle for the deep, rich, salty mineral taste I craved.

Their tastes vary on factors like the species of fish used (most commonly oily fish varieties); whether it is fresh water or from the open sea; how much salt is added; whether or not fish is the only protein (there are versions that include krill, squid, prawns, soy and even wheat); what kind of vessel was used during the ageing process; the method of extraction and so on. Speak to a connoisseur, and they will tell you that these are all crucial to differentiation between sauces. Most of us don\u2019t look at the fine print \u2013 but it\u2019s worth it.</p> <h2>How to choose quality fish sauce, wherever you live:</h2> <ul> <li><p>Look for a minimum of three ingredients, the main one being fish.&nbsp;</p></li> <li><p>Make sure the sauce is preservative-free, colour-free, MSG-free and additive-free.</p></li> <li><p>Minimum to no sugar is my preference, as during the cooking process you can add your own sweet element. You have more control over this if you are using seasoning that starts off with a higher purity.</p></li> <li><p>What you pay for is often what you get. If there\u2019s a difference of a couple of dollars, pay more. A little fish sauce goes a long way.</p></li> <li><p>Buy a larger bottle, it\u2019s often more economical and it\u2019ll keep.</p></li> <li><p>When you read the label, don\u2019t be confused by the number before an N. This means the level of amino nitrogen, and indicates the protein level in the sauce. The higher the number the better the grade. Look for anything over 30N.</p></li> <li><p>As in olive oil, the first pressing is always the best.&nbsp;</p></li> </ul> <h2><br>Brands to look out for</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ee49c7d1d2cd40e309cbedd9d290e9d99917a9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ee49c7d1d2cd40e309cbedd9d290e9d99917a9e/157_75_3382_2195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Red Boat and Megachef fish sauces\" width=\"1000\" height=\"649\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Red Boat is light enough to use as a dressing on salad greens, while Megachef is a favourite of chefs such as Christine Mansfield and Andy Ricker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Red Boat, Megachef</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some of my favourite South East Asian fish sauces are made in Phu Cuoc, Vietnam and the Traat region of Southern Thailand.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Megachef brown label premium fish sauce</strong>: This is a collaboration between Megachef and the venerable chef David Thompson.

The complaints were first revealed by the Telegraph on Friday.</p> <p>The nature of the complaints is not known. The force\u2019s findings published on Thursday prompted anger both from people who believe Cummings did break the law and those who believe the force should never have retrospectively investigated the matter.</p> <p>A Durham constabulary spokesman said: \u201cThere is currently no investigation into the force\u2019s handling of this inquiry.\u201d </p> <p>The professional standards department could decide to take matters further if it believes there is enough evidence to warrant a misconduct investigation.

  "<p>The Premiership is unlikely to return until late July at the earliest following a study \u2013 co-authored by the Rugby Football Union\u2019s chief doctor \u2013 which finds that players will need six weeks of training before matches can begin.</p> <p>The study, written by a group of leading medics including the RFU\u2019s Simon Kemp, also warns of the increased risk of both injury and anxiety among players when returning to training and competitive matches.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/28/premiership-will-not-adopt-world-rugbys-law-trials-to-reduce-virus-risk-rugby-union\">Premiership will not adopt World Rugby\u2019s law trials to reduce virus risk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Premiership clubs have still not returned to any form of training despite being given approval from the government to do so. It was hoped a meeting of key stakeholders on Thursday would provide more clarity but a date for returning to training is now not expected until next week. Different clubs have varying views on how many weeks of training will be required before matches can begin with a number believing four will be sufficient. The study published on Friday is likely to lead to a further delay, however.</p> <p>\u201cA period of around six weeks of preparation is likely to be sufficient for most athletes to return to being competition ready,\u201d reads the study. \u201cAlthough this will ultimately depend on the length of governmental social distancing policies, which differ by country.\u201d</p> <p>Premiership Rugby still hopes to complete its entire season \u2013 nine remaining rounds as well as the play-offs \u2013 but increasingly that is looking unlikely. Indeed, the Northampton chairman, John White, admitted that it may end up being the case that only play-offs take place, based on current league positions. He said: \u201cAs time rolls on, we may not get nine rounds in \u2013 it may go down to just play-offs eventually. But there is a determination to see the season out, so I think we will do that.\u201d</p> <p>The fact that Kemp co-authored the new study is significant because he is responsible for drawing up a list of stringent protocols that clubs must adhere to before returning to training. The present hold-up is in the main because of concerns over testing but the study raises additional issues of the dangers of players suffering injuries after a lengthy lay-off. Drawing on comparisons with the NFL, which was shut down for 20 weeks in 2011 and saw a significant increase in achilles injuries upon returning, the study also warns that the length of the lockdown could lead to more injuries next season.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.<br></figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cA key concern arising from a period of enforced modified training due to Covid-19 is that athletes cannot maintain physical qualities that likely protect against injury,\u201d continues the study. \u201cA 20-week shutdown of the National Football League in 2011 was associated with a four-fold increase in achilles tendon ruptures in the first 29 days of a condensed return to competition period. Over the subsequent season, soft tissue injuries were higher than preceding or subsequent seasons.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIn professional rugby union, even after a short off-season typically lasting four-to-five weeks during which athletes have opportunities to train, there is a greater frequency and burden of training injuries in the early, compared with later, period of pre-season. This highlights one of the challenges when athletes return following an extended period of enforced modified training.\u201d</p>",

The officer is alleged to be seen dragging the 44-year-old male off his bike before pulling down the man\u2019s protective face mask.</p> <p>The video also apparently showed a female colleague holding the man down while the male officer appeared to punch the cyclist three times in the back.</p> <p>Further footage emerged of an incident on 27 February in the Handsworth area of Birmingham where Trevalie Wyse, a 30-year-old local black man, had witnessed a car crash. The same officer in the April incidents is seen ordering the man to the ground even though he was a bystander: he was then shot with a stun gun for failing to get down on the floor.</p> <p>Wyse later described being shot with the weapon: \u201cI was hit in the stomach and in the throat. I passed out \u2013 when you\u2019re being Tasered, it\u2019s not a nice feeling \u2026 It\u2019s disgraceful, there was no reason to do that whatsoever.\u201d</p> <p>On the use of the weapons by the West Midlands force and excessive police actions in general, Joseph Morgan, a solicitor with Bindmans, said: \u201cThe recent incident in Birmingham highlights the dangers of arming rank-and-file officers with Tasers. Police guidance on the use of Tasers is vague and leaves much to the judgment of individual officers. With the significant government rollout of Tasers to police forces leading to a rapid increase in their use in recent years, it is to be expected that instances of police officers overzealously using Tasers against members of the public would also increase.\u201d</p> <p>Deborah Coles, the director of Inquest, said the use of stun guns and excessive use of force generally by some police officers disproportionately targeted black people and other ethnic minorities.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a sense in these communities that no one is ever held accountable after deaths and serious incidents. The test for the credibility of this IOPC investigation will be if something happens as a result,\u201d Coles said.</p> <p>The head of the West Midlands force\u2019s professional standards department, Chief Supt Chris Todd, said: \u201cServing and protecting the public is paramount and it is vital that our communities have trust and confidence in everything that we do.\u201d</p> <p>Derrick Campbell, the IOPC\u2019s director in the region, said: \u201cI would like to reassure communities in the West Midlands that full, fair and thorough independent investigations are under way into all of these incidents and the conduct matters brought to our attention by the force.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 May 2020 to clarify a paraphrasing of the IOPC\u2019s inquiry. The headline was also amended.</p>",

No, the senator said, but he added that if a vacancy does arise, filling it before the election \u201cwould be the goal\u201d.</p> <p>McConnell famously refused to replace Scalia with Merrick Garland, Barack Obama\u2019s nominee, a moderate, the Senate leader citing contested precedent when claiming vacancies should not be filled in an election year.</p> <p>McConnell has said no such strictures would apply in what could be Trump\u2019s last year in office.</p> <p>\u201cWe changed the rules for the supreme court [to require a simple majority for confirmation],\u201d Graham said.</p> <p>\u201cSo if a vacancy did occur, and I don\u2019t expect one to, I hope everybody has a long, healthy 2020 on the court \u2026 you would see an effort by Republicans, I\u2019m sure, to fill the vacancy.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>One Friday evening in 1953, <a href=\"http://www.richardanuszkiewicz.com/\" title=\"\">Richard Anuszkiewicz</a>, who has died aged 89, was painting in his cubicle at the Yale School of Art when a white-haired figure appeared silently at his side. This was <a href=\"https://albersfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Josef Albers</a>, the ex-Bauhaus master who was then chairman of the school\u2019s painting department. Albers was famed for the brutality of his Friday night critiques, or \u201ccrits\u201d. Ex-GIs, back from Korea, would emerge from them with tears running down their faces. \u201cYou never really knew whether he was going to tear you down or build you up in a crit,\u201d Anuszkiewicz recalled in an interview in 1996. \u201cYou had your suspicions, though.\u201d</p> <p>When the German paled in front of Anuszkiewicz\u2019s painting \u2013 of a butcher in a gory apron, in the gritty, New York <a href=\"https://www.theartstory.org/movement/ashcan-school/\" title=\"\">Ashcan school</a> style \u2013 the 23-year-old student feared the worst. Instead, Albers croaked, \u201cAch, boy, you don\u2019t mind if I don\u2019t look at it. I can\u2019t stand blood,\u201d and stalked off. This was the more unexpected because figure painting was one of many genres for which Albers had no time. The worst sin, though, was to paint like Albers. He was then three years into the series <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/albers-study-for-homage-to-the-square-t02312\" title=\"\">Homage to the Square</a>. Students who painted squares would receive the rebuke, \u201cThat\u2019s my shape! Go get your own.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlbers shook up my whole way of thinking,\u201d Anuszkiewicz would later say. \u201cIt took me a couple of years to get myself reassembled.\u201d It was only after leaving Yale in 1955 that he would feel free to develop the style for which he became known. This, to his ex-teacher\u2019s annoyance, would for a decade involve the painting of squares.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7a959133bded924df9e1514cc29b99ad19568cee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a959133bded924df9e1514cc29b99ad19568cee/0_0_900_653/500.jpg\" alt=\"Grand Midnight Palace, 1989, from Anuszkiewicz\u2019s Translumina series.\" width=\"500\" height=\"363\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grand Midnight Palace, 1989, from Anuszkiewicz\u2019s Translumina series.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Estate of  Richard Anuszkiewicz</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anuszkiewicz was born in the rust-belt town of Erie, Pennsylvania, not far from his contemporary, Andy Warhol. Like Warhol\u2019s, his family was working class, religious and came from Mitteleuropa. Richard\u2019s Polish-born father, Adam, was a machinist in a paper mill; his mother, Victoria (nee Jankowski), a widow who already had five children. Richard would be the only child of their marriage.</p> <p>The nuns at the local Catholic parish school noticed, and encouraged, his precocious talent for drawing. In 1947, Anuszkiewicz won a National Scholastic Art award, followed the next year by a full scholarship to the Institute of Art in Cleveland, Ohio, from where he graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in fine arts in 1953. That year as well, he was given a Pulitzer travel fellowship. Rather than using this to go to Europe, Anuszkiewicz put it towards a master\u2019s under Albers at Yale.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Everybody would say: \u2018Oh, they are nice, but so hard to look at. They hurt my eyes.\u2019</p> <footer> <cite>Richard Anuszkiewicz</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was while studying for a teaching degree at Kent State University in Ohio (1955-56) that he began to paint seriously and, as he put it, \u201cnon-objectively\u201d. Gone were the realist scenes of midwestern life. \u201cFor the first time I discovered what a full complementary will do,\u201d Anuszkiewicz recalled. \u201cWhen you put a red on a blue, you have this kind of fluorescent effect.\u201d In 1957, he moved to a New York still in thrall to the abstract expressionists. Dealers were unimpressed by the young out-of-towner\u2019s optical discoveries. \u201cEverybody would say: \u2018Oh, they are nice, but so hard to look at,\u2019\u201d Anuszkiewicz remembered. \u201c\u2018They hurt my eyes.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>His luck changed when he showed his work to Karl Lunde, the scholarly owner of the Contemporaries gallery on Madison Avenue, who offered Anuszkiewicz a show in March 1960. Initially a flop, this became an overnight success when Alfred Barr, director of the Museum of Modern Art, walked in and bought a work called <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/works/79522\" title=\"\">Fluorescent Complement</a> (1960), showing it with other MoMA acquisitions later that year. By 1961, there was a waiting list for his eye-popping pictures.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"155a6e1f829eb8a96e8df8d17f1fff0c2735fdcb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/155a6e1f829eb8a96e8df8d17f1fff0c2735fdcb/0_0_900_861/500.jpg\" alt=\"Marriage of Warm and Cool, 1991.\" width=\"500\" height=\"478\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marriage of Warm and Cool, 1991.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Estate of  Richard Anuszkiewicz</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was a MoMA exhibition called <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/2914\" title=\"\">The Responsive Eye</a> that brought his work to a broader public. Opening in February 1965, this would define what had lately been dubbed op (optical) art. The two stars of the show were Anuszkiewicz and a British painter called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/bridget-riley\" title=\"\">Bridget Riley</a>. \u201cAnuszkiewicz,\u201d wrote the critic of the New York Times, \u201cmight already be called an op old master \u2026 a virtuoso technician whose sizzling colours arranged in symmetrical bands, stripes and squares almost jump from canvas to eye.\u201d Time magazine ran a profile of the artist alongside a full-page illustration of his painting <a href=\"http://www.anuszkiewicz.com/paintings/1960s?page=1\" title=\"\">Plus Reversed</a> (1960). Life magazine anointed Anuszkiewicz \u201cthe new wizard of op\u201d.</p> <p>The Responsive Eye would prove to be the high point of his career. Although successful on its own terms, Anuszkiewicz\u2019s work was hard to live with. A painting such as <a href=\"https://curiator.com/art/richard-anuszkiewicz/principle-of-unity\" title=\"\">Principle of Unity</a> (1966), based, like Albers\u2019, on the square, disconcerts by refusing to settle. No sooner has the eye located a colour in space than space and colour switch about, foreground becoming background and vice versa. The dazzling interaction of complementaries leaves afterimages on the viewer\u2019s retina, so that the timing of psychological perception \u2013 a subject in which Anuszkiewicz took a keen interest \u2013 is called into question. The colours in Albers\u2019 Homages help each other along; the colours in works such as the ones in Anuszkiewicz\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.lorettahoward.com/catalogues/richard-anuszkiewicz-translumina-series\" title=\"\">Translumina</a> series (1986-2001) trip each other up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da05082dbe82c971ef3a62102137e8262c44a6fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da05082dbe82c971ef3a62102137e8262c44a6fd/0_590_3817_2291/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Anuszkiewicz in 1968.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Anuszkiewicz in 1968.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This discomfiture was reflected in sales. In 1965, his annus mirabilis, Anuszkiewicz had been taken on by Sidney Janis, a gallerist whose stable included Philip Guston, Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko and, inevitably, Albers. By 1976, Janis\u2019s tastes had moved on from op and Anuszkiewicz left for the less blue-chip Andrew Crispo.</p> <p>In the 1970s and 80s, his work grew more mathematical, the fields of luminescent colour in the Spectral series being divided up by calibrated lines. In the decade after that, Anuszkiewicz\u2019s paintings turned architectural. An early job touching up plaster models of classical temples in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York now showed itself in the thin strips of wood that he glued to columnar shapes on canvases in the Translumina series. Later still, wood was replaced by laser-cut aluminium, followed by a series called <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/63050463512182393/\" title=\"\">For Mondrian</a> (2000) made of painted steel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23b5d3b6b9481c3dde1d1991d7567fbd19dcb452\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23b5d3b6b9481c3dde1d1991d7567fbd19dcb452/0_0_2109_2700/781.jpg\" alt=\"Plus Reversed, 1960.\" width=\"781\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plus Reversed, 1960.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Museum of Art, University of Austin, Texas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For all its visibility, though, Anuszkiewicz\u2019s work faded from the public eye. When the gallerist <a href=\"https://www.lorettahoward.com/artists/richard-anuszkiewicz/selected-works\" title=\"\">Loretta Howard</a> gave him an <a href=\"https://www.lorettahoward.com/catalogues/richard-anuszkiewicz-new-work-2003-2013\" title=\"\">exhibition in 2013</a>, it was his first in New York for more than a decade; <a href=\"https://www.lorettahoward.com/artists/richard-anuszkiewicz/a-exhibitions\" title=\"\">more followed</a>, the most recent <a href=\"https://www.lorettahoward.com/exhibitions/specific-forms\" title=\"\">this year</a>. Although Anuszkiewicz\u2019s career was not to enjoy the late second flowering of Riley\u2019s. If this was a source of dismay, it did not show. Asked, in old age, about his cash-strapped upbringing, Anuszkiewicz replied, \u201cI really had a very happy childhood ... I had companionship, affection, all the good things.\u201d This contentment carried on into later life.</p> <p>In 1960 he married Sally (Elizabeth) Feeney, a schoolteacher. In 1967, the couple moved to suburban Englewood, New Jersey, where they raised their three children, Adam, Stephanie and Christine, and where Anuszkiewicz painted from home. Sally and his children survive him.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Richard Joseph Anuszkiewicz, artist, born 23 May 1930; died 19 May 2020</p>",

  "<p>Boris Johnson\u2019s government began daily Downing Street briefings about the Covid-19 pandemic in the second half of March. Back then, the briefings tried to do two things at once. They addressed an urgent public need for reliable information about the advance of the coronavirus. They also tried to shape the way the public should respond to the health, lifestyle and economic threats that it carried. The structure of the briefings evolved on the hoof. They were far from perfect in a number of ways. Nevertheless, in the absence of parliament, which went into recess until 21 April, the briefings performed a useful public information and advice function for an anxious nation in lockdown.</p> <p>Ten weeks on, that is quite simply no longer true. <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/uk-public-still-staying-home-huge-degree-and-even-getting-used-lockdown-life-new-data-reveals\" title=\"\">The gap</a> between the public\u2019s caution and the government\u2019s desire to lift lockdown restrictions is stark. Mr Johnson has also been badly damaged by the Cummings affair. The daily updates have become increasingly tendentious and uninformative. Objectivity has fought a losing battle against the government\u2019s increasingly beleaguered mishandling of the pandemic. It is therefore now time to end the briefings in their current form.</p> <p>The decline in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/slides-and-datasets-to-accompany-coronavirus-press-conferences\" title=\"\">briefings</a> has had many features. Statistics have been presented in inconsistent ways that sow confusion and even suspicion. Ministers, whose talent varies, have grown more defensive and evasive when questioned. The inevitable overlaps between political and scientific messaging have become notably more opaque. Government suspicion of the media has caused curtailing of questioning and the refusal of follow-ups. On Tuesday, parliament, to which any government is constitutionally accountable, <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/about/faqs/house-of-commons-faqs/business-faq-page/recess-dates/\" title=\"\">returns for two months</a>. It is time to do things differently and better.</p> <p>The defects of the Downing Street system came to a head <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqU-a5dT5Qc\" title=\"\">on Thursday</a> in the briefing over which Mr Johnson presided disgracefully. There was no serious attempt to inform in the spirit of sound science that had marked the early weeks of the pandemic. Instead, Mr Johnson resorted to browbeating of advisers, journalists and the public. Some of Thursday\u2019s problems were of long standing: the presentation of meaningless aggregate figures, the ever-shifting baselines used for statistical trends (Thursday\u2019s slides all started their measurements on different dates), the potentially misleading shapes of graphs, the now-you-see-them-now-you-don\u2019t approach to information about care homes, and the abject abandonment of embarrassing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/may/29/excess-deaths-uk-has-one-highest-levels-europe\" title=\"\">international comparisons</a>.</p> <p>Other problems, though, were far more immediate. Mr Johnson\u2019s desperation to keep Dominic Cummings in his job was at the heart of most of them. It meant that Thursday\u2019s briefing became a concerted effort to bulldoze all questions about Mr Cummings out of the way, and instead to bombard the public with announcements about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/uk-lockdown-rules-what-are-the-key-changes\" title=\"\">easing the lockdown</a>. Mr Johnson bluntly refused to discuss Mr Cummings. When he then prevented England\u2019s chief scientist and chief medical officer from answering any Cummings-related questions either, the prime minister crossed a line. He destroyed the briefings\u2019 always uneasy balance between public information and political propaganda.</p> <p>When Mr Johnson said that the purpose of Thursday\u2019s briefing was \u201cto crack on with our programme and [get] our messages across\u201d, he gave the game away. That was not the original purpose of the briefings at all. But the briefings have long since shaken off much of their original purpose of providing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/coronavirus-symptoms-not-isolating-sage-track-and-trace\" title=\"\">clear public information</a>. Instead they have become a politically driven daily broadcast at the public\u2019s expense. Mr Johnson\u2019s reputation and ratings have been thrown overboard as he clung to the manifestly out-of-order Mr Cummings. Now the reliability of the briefings has been sacrificed too.</p> <p>As the <a href=\"https://media.service.gov.wales/news/stay-local-to-keep-wales-safe-changes-to-the-lockdown-announced\" title=\"\">governments of Britain</a> edge their way out of the lockdown next week, it is time to disentangle the different threads that make up the briefings. Information about the pandemic should be under the control of independent government scientists, medical advisers and statisticians, who should be able to present the facts without political spin or censorship. Policy is the government\u2019s and the people\u2019s business. Ministers are accountable to parliament for what they intend to do next. Britain, especially England, is now advancing into a dangerous new phase of the pandemic. The country needs the right tools to ensure that wise choices are made. The current briefings make that far more difficult.</p>",
  "<p>Wales will ease its lockdown regulations from Monday with plans unveiled to allow family and friends to meet outside.</p> <p>The Welsh government has taken a slower approach than England to lifting the strict stay-at-home coronavirus guidelines, as has Nicola Sturgeon in Scotland.</p> <p>Under new \u201cstay local\u201d guidelines, which replace the \u201cstay at home\u201d message, two households in the same area will be able to meet outdoors, but they will need to follow social distancing and strict hand hygiene practices to control the spread of the virus. Travel will be allowed if it is to work, to seek care or for shopping for essentials if they are not available locally.</p> <p>The first minister, Mark Drakeford, said he believed the Welsh public were \u201ccomfortable with the careful and cautious approach\u201d of his government.</p> <p>Anticipating an increase in trips to the Welsh coast, he limited travel to a five-mile radius around a home. He added that those who lived in coastal communities were \u201cabsolutely entitled\u201d to use the beach, but people were not allowed to travel more than five miles to get to a beach.</p> <p>Drakeford said his approach had been dictated by the R number - which refers to the average number of people that one infected person can expect to spread the virus on to. He said Wales had \u201climited headroom\u201d for relaxing restrictions as the R infection rate in the country remained at 0.8 and was falling more slowly than expected.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe R rate across Wales is no better today than it was three weeks ago, which is why we have only limited headroom to make any difference.</p> <p>\u201cAnd that is why we decided to focus on this one measure to allow households to see one another.\u201d</p> <p>Drakeford later said there was no cap on the number of people from one household that could meet people from another household, but warned that the new guidelines were not an \u201cinvitation\u201d to meet up.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe safest thing remains to see as few people as you can and to stay as locally as you can.</p> <p>\u201cRunning to people\u2019s houses, sitting in gardens close together, having a beer and it all breaking down - that\u2019s definitely not what we are proposing in Wales.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/covid-19-spreading-too-fast-to-lift-uk-lockdown-sage-adviser\">Covid-19 spreading too fast to lift lockdown in England \u2013 Sage adviser</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Drakeford was criticised for the five-mile restriction on travel, with the rule being described as \u201carbitrary\u201d by the former leader of the Welsh Conservative group, Andrew Davies.</p> <p>Davies called on the first minister to reconsider, claiming it would unfairly affect those living in rural communities.</p> <p>\u201cNot everyone in Wales lives in a town or city close to family and friends, and this will unfairly impact those in our rural communities. I therefore politely ask the first minister to change this regulation,\u201d he said.</p> <p>However Drakeford said the restriction was necessary to prevent the virus spreading from one area to another.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m asking people to do is to use that judgment seriously and soberly. The further you travel, the greater the risk that is posed to yourself and others of coronavirus ending up in parts of Wales where we\u2019ve succeeded in keeping it to a minimum. Nobody, I think, wants to do that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On Thursday, Public Health Wales announced a further 14 people had died after testing positive for Covid-19, bringing its total confirmed deaths to 1,307, though the true number is said to be more than 2,000.</p> <p>Another 72 cases of the virus were also reported, bringing the total of confirmed cases in Wales so far to 13,725.</p>",

Someone let off fireworks.</p> \n<p>\u201cNo justice, no peace,\u201d came the cry. \u201cFuck the police.\u201d</p> \n<p>But there were no police in sight.

So Urquhart he became.<br><strong>Sue Atkins</strong><br><em>Lewes, East Sussex</em></p> <p>\u2022 When we moved to our house on a farm in the Scottish Borders, some 46 years ago, there were five or six albino pheasants, the pride of the owner.

  "<p>Martin Scorsese\u2019s Zoom call to the world is a marvellous coup for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000jjqc\">Mary Beard\u2019s BBC Lockdown Culture</a> special: a personal short film shot on his smartphone \u2013&nbsp;sometimes artlessly in portrait mode, sometimes giving it a clockwise quarter-turn for the more professional landscape format. (He does seem to be holding the phone himself.)</p> <p>It is a brief, intense, ruminative snapshot about his life in his New York apartment during the lockdown. We see Scorsese brooding on his house arrest. At some moments, his face looks very glum, as if perennially struck afresh with the novelty of what is happening, the fact that there is no end in sight, and the impossibility of coming to terms with it until there is. Occasionally his face will be lit up with a smile that makes him look decades younger. We get tantalising glimpses of bookshelves, family photos, and what is conceivably an east Asian carved figure (something from his movie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/dec/11/reel-history-kundun\">Kundun</a> perhaps? Or maybe Silence?)</p> <p>And of course Scorsese gives us a couple of movie clips: Hitchcock\u2019s The Wrong Man, which allows us to reflect on the nature of wrongful imprisonment, and Scorsese playfully lets the background music from this continue under what he is saying. There is also Siodmak\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/14/the-killers-robert-siodmak-dvd-philip-french-classic-burt-lancaster-ava-gardner\">The Killers</a>, which shows us Burt Lancaster and the other prisoners looking out through the bars and gazing at the stars, which one of them has learning about with a book from the prison library. Has their lockdown has given them an insight into the universe? (It\u2019s impossible to watch this without remembering some of Scorsese\u2019s own great prison scenes: Jake LaMotta pounding the walls of his cell in Raging Bull, Paulie savouring his cuisine in GoodFellas, the ageing Russell playing bowls in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/13/the-irishman-review-martin-scorseses-finest-film-for-30-years\">The Irishman</a>.

He is vulnerable. For me the impact of this little film is that it really brought that fact home to me for the first time. I think of him as a dynamic force in the movies, which of course he is. But he is also a human being and I loved his honesty and insight about the fact that when the lockdown first hit he was just relieved. He could step off the treadmill for a little, simply take a break from the demanding schedule.</p> <p>But now that novelty is wearing off. You can see Scorsese straining to get back to work, you can a little hint of that mega-espresso livewire jittery energy starting to kick back in. But it\u2019s co-existing with what looks like a new reflection on mortality. Scorsese ponders his final meeting with the late Iranian film-maker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/jul/04/abbas-kiarostami-master-of-cinematic-poetry-peter-bradshaw\">Abbas Kiarostami</a>, and what Kiarostami told him about the unreliability of time.

Floyd told the officers he could not breathe 12 times, including within the first few seconds of the video.&nbsp;Floyd said: \u201cI\u2019m about to die \u2026 they\u2019re gonna kill me,\u201d and called out for his mother.&nbsp;He lost consciousness, stopped breathing and his body went limp after four minutes. Forty seconds later witnesses told officers that Floyd was unresponsive. At least 16 times they asked the officers to take his pulse.&nbsp;</p> <p>The officers even prevented a woman who identified herself as an EMT from trying to save his life.&nbsp;Two minutes and 20 seconds after Floyd lost consciousness, witnesses began to say: \u201cThey just killed him.\u201d&nbsp;The officers all knew that Floyd was unconscious, was not breathing, that his body was limp, but an officer kept his knee pressed on his windpipe, making sure he did not breathe for another four minutes, despite witnesses\u2019 relentless insistence that he was dying.&nbsp;If the witnesses knew he was dying, the officers knew he was dying.&nbsp;The officers knew that Floyd needed oxygen to live, but they never attempted CPR, never took his pulse and never tried to save his life.</p> <p>Racism is the eye staring down the barrel of our justice system and threatening to pull the trigger. Recall that only after a mass protest movement did the officer who killed Eric Garner in a chokehold face any consequences.&nbsp;</p> <p>Freeman cannot allow the Minneapolis police officers who killed Floyd to elude criminal charges under the weak, shameful excuse that the level of force used was \u201cnon-lethal\u201d, or that the officers didn\u2019t know that Floyd would die without oxygen. That argument is as dishonest as saying they didn\u2019t know what happens to a fish out of water.&nbsp;We can all visualize that image: the fish out of water, its mouth open and gasping for air; and we all know the fish is going to die, just like the officers knew that Floyd was going to die.&nbsp;</p> <p>We encourage people to call Mike Freeman at (612) 348-5550 and demand that the officers involved in killing George Floyd be charged with first-degree murder.</p> <ul> <li><p>Ben Crump is a civil rights attorney and founder of the national law firm Ben Crump Law.

  "<p>It has been called the \u201cMinnesota paradox\u201d. The Twin Cities, comprising the conjoined urban areas of Minneapolis and St Paul, regularly tops the list of places in the US with the best quality of living.</p> <p>Largely low rise and sprawling, set around the cities\u2019 lakes and the Mississippi, the area is marked by affordable and largely good quality housing with lawns, parks, museums and tree-lined streets.</p> <p>Its politics too have long reflected a strong progressive strand, represented by figures such as the late senator Paul Wellstone, once described as the most liberal member of the Senate. Employment \u2013 pre-pandemic, at least \u2013 was high, and St Paul serves as the global headquarters for 3M.</p> <p>But there is another side to living in Minnesota, often ignored. Factor in the black and ethnic minority experience, and the state is suddenly not such a good place to live.</p> <p>Despite Minneapolis celebrating itself as the city of Prince and Paisley Park, Minnesota\u2019s black education and employment outcomes by US national standards have long been dismal in comparison with those of the state\u2019s white population.</p> <p>Rated in 2018 second in terms of overall best states in which to live in the US, in the same year Minnesota ranked close to the bottom for both employment gap by race (47th) and income gap by race (38th).&nbsp;</p> <p>According to a report released last year, even before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/28/jobless-america-unemployment-coronavirus-in-figures\">mass unemployment triggered by the coronavirus</a> took hold, some 10% of black American residents of the Twin Cities were unemployed compared with just under 4% of white American residents. Given the pandemic\u2019s disproportionate impact on communities of color, that already bad situation has now worsened.</p> <p>The reality of Minneapolis and St Paul is that behind the veneer of \u201cMinnesota nice\u201d, behind the reputation of a socially liberal and highly tolerant metropolitan area (in contrast with the state\u2019s more conservative rural areas), there have long been glaring divisions along racial lines in a place where 20% of the population is African-American.</p> <p>Despite having a white mayor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/jacob-frey-donald-trump-minneapolis-mayor-tweets-riots\">Jacob Frey</a>, who has been outspoken about the problems of structural racism, and being located in the same congressional district that elected Ilhan Omar, the state\u2019s first non-white woman to be elected to Congress, race relations have foundered on chronic inequalities and a series of high-profile killings of black people involving the 800-strong police force.</p> <p>As the academic Samuel Myers, who coined the notion of the Minnesota paradox, pointed out two years ago, it is not only in employment and income gaps that the paradox exists, pointing to racial disparities in incarceration rates, in child maltreatment report rates, educational outcomes, and even racial disparities in drowning rates.</p> <p>Among all these indicators, it is education that has witnessed one of the worst disparities, despite this being acknowledged as a problem by state officials and leading to a current restructuring effort to try to address the inequalities.</p> <p>According to a report last year, while 95.9% of white adults in the Twin Cities metro area have a high school diploma, one of the highest figures in the US, just 82.2% of black adults do, a number below the national black high school attainment rate of 84.9%.</p> <p>Add to all that the dangerous accelerant of the issue of police violence against black people, including the police shootings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/philando-castile-shooting\">Philand</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/philando-castile-shooting\">o Castile</a> in 2016 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/31/jamar-clark-police-killing-no-charges-minneapolis-protesters\">Jamar Clark </a>in 2015, which led to protests that shut down some of the city\u2019s highways, and what occurred this week becomes more understandable.</p> <p>Finally, as one resident pointed out to the Guardian, the impact of the coronavirus \u2013 not least its devastating economic impact on the poorest and least protected communities \u2013 has fed the simmering anger that existed before George Floyd\u2019s killing.</p> <p>All of which has left a journey along Minneapolis\u2019s historic east-west thoroughfare Lake Street, location of the 3<sup>rd</sup> police precinct which was attacked after the Floyd killing, as a metaphor for many of the tensions.</p> <p>A longtime magnet for new immigrants, from Scandinavians in the 19<sup>th</sup> century through black Americans during the Great Migration and those who relocated from cities such as Chicago in the 60s and 70s, to Hispanic, Hmong and most recently Somali immigrants, this street underlines the disparities.</p> <p>Running from uptown with its wealthy homes, and bookended by the middle class neighborhoods close to the river where Black Lives Matter placards proliferated on lawns in 2016 after Castile\u2019s killing, it also traverses poorer neighborhoods with immigrant-run businesses.</p> <p>It was not always this way. While race relations in the state have largely mirrored the wider experience of the US, the Twin Cites in the 60s and 70s were seen for the African Americans who relocated there as a place with access to jobs and good schooling.</p> <p>But race in Minnesota has become foregrounded even more in the Trump era, as some local rightwing politicians in towns such as Saint Cloud, outside the metropolitan area, have fostered anti-immigrant sentiment aimed largely at Somalis and Latinos.</p> <p>All of which led Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/opinion/george-floyd-minneapolis.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">write in the New York Times</a> that what is \u201cunmistakable in the bitter protests in Minneapolis and around the country is the sense that the state is either complicit or incapable of effecting substantive change\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>Before his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/27/george-floyd-sister-police-officers-should-be-charged-with-murder\">death</a> beneath a Minneapolis police officer\u2019s knee, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> was suffering the same fate as millions of Americans during the coronavirus pandemic: out of work and looking for a new job.</p> \n<p>Floyd moved to Minneapolis from his native Houston several years ago in hopes of finding work and starting a new life, said Christopher Harris, Floyd\u2019s lifelong friend.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe was looking to start over fresh, a new beginning,\u201d Harris said. \u201cHe was happy with the change he was making.\u201d</p> \n<p>As a teen in Texas he was a football star many nicknamed \u201cgentle giant\u201d.</p> \n<p>But he lost his job as a bouncer at a restaurant when Minnesota\u2019s governor issued a stay-at-home order.</p> \n<p>On Monday night, an employee at a Minneapolis grocery store called police after Floyd allegedly tried to pass a counterfeit $20 bill. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/27/george-floyd-sister-police-officers-should-be-charged-with-murder\">a video</a> of the subsequent arrest, taken by one of the many members of the public that witnessed the violent event, Floyd, who was black, can be seen on the ground with his hands cuffed behind him while a white officer, Derek Chauvin, presses him to the pavement with his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck.</p> \n<p>Chauvin can be seen holding Floyd down for minutes as Floyd complains he can\u2019t breathe, speaking with greater difficulty and then becoming unresponsive, as witnesses beg the officers to release him. The video ends with paramedics lifting a limp Floyd on to a stretcher and placing him in an ambulance.</p> \n<p>Floyd, 46, grew up in Houston\u2019s Third Ward, one of the city\u2019s predominantly black neighborhoods, where he and Harris met in middle school. At 6ft6in, Floyd emerged as a star football player, positioned as the tight end for Jack Yates\u2019 high school team, and played in the 1992 state championship game in the Houston Astrodome.</p> \n<p>Donnell Cooper, one of Floyd\u2019s former classmates, said he remembered watching Floyd score touchdowns. Floyd towered over everyone and earned the nickname \u201cgentle giant\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cQuiet personality but a beautiful spirit,\u201d Cooper said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"877b9c6d-7c9c-4a97-827a-1b9af0c16314\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iwPPqDryPO8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>His life later took a different turn and in 2007 Floyd was charged with armed robbery in a home invasion in Houston and in 2009 was sentenced to five years in prison as part of a plea deal, according to court documents.</p> \n<p>Harris, Floyd\u2019s childhood friend, said he and some of their mutual friends had moved to Minneapolis in search of jobs around 2014. Harris said he talked Floyd into moving there as well after he got out of prison.Floyd landed a job working security at a Salvation Army store in downtown Minneapolis. He later started working two jobs, one driving trucks and another as a bouncer at Conga Latin Bistro, where he was known as \u201cBig Floyd\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cAlways cheerful,\u201d Jovanni Tunstrom, the bistro\u2019s owner, said. \u201cHe had a good attitude. He would dance badly to make people laugh. I tried to teach him how to dance because he loved Latin music, but I couldn\u2019t because he was too tall for me. He always called me \u2018Bossman\u2019. I said, \u2018Floyd, don\u2019t call me Bossman. I\u2019m your friend.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Harris said Floyd was laid off when Minnesota shut down restaurants as part of a stay-at-home order to curb the Covid-19 pandemic. He said he spoke with Floyd on Sunday night and gave him some information for contacting a temporary jobs agency.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe was doing whatever it takes to maintain going forward with his life,\u201d Harris said, adding he couldn\u2019t believe that Floyd would resort to forgery. \u201cI\u2019ve never known him to do anything like that.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThe way he died was senseless,\u201d Harris said. \u201cHe begged for his life. He pleaded for his life. When you try so hard to put faith in this system, a system that you know isn\u2019t designed for you, when you constantly seek justice by lawful means and you can\u2019t get it, you begin to take the law into your own hands.\u201d</p> \n<p>Floyd leaves behind a six-year-old daughter who still lives in Houston with her mother, Roxie Washington,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/George-Floyd-police-brutality-minneapolis-dead-vid-15296192.php\">the Houston Chronicle reported</a>.</p>",
  "<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/south-korea\">South Korea</a>&nbsp;</strong>has postponed the planned reopening of more than 800 schools as it battles a renewed outbreak of the coronavirus, with cases now at their highest level for almost two months.</p> <p>The country\u2019s easing of lockdown measures has gone into reverse, with museums, parks and art galleries closed again on Friday for two weeks. Kindergarten pupils, and some primary and secondary school students were due back from Wednesday, in the last phase of school reopenings.</p> <p>According to the education ministry, however, 838 schools out of 20,902 nationwide remain shut. They are located in areas hard hit by the latest wave of infections, including the capital, Seoul, and the cities of Bucheon and Gumi.</p> <p>South Korea has been praised for its deft handling of the Covid crisis. It seemed to have brought the virus under control only to record 79 new cases this week, the highest daily figure for two months. The government has responded by bringing back lockdown measures in the Seoul metropolitan area, home to half of the country\u2019s 51 million population.</p> <p>Most of these cases have been linked to a distribution centre in Bucheon. The warehouse is run by the country\u2019s biggest e-commerce firm Coupang. Health officials traced at least 82 infections to the facility, with the virus found on workers\u2019 shoes and clothes. They are now testing all employees and visitors.</p> <p>In the <strong>Philippines</strong>, meanwhile, plans were unveiled on Friday to ease strict lockdown measures despite a record spike in new cases. The country reported 539 infections on Thursday, bringing its total to 15,588, with 921 deaths.</p> <p>From Monday the capital, Manila, will allow gatherings of up to 10 people and free movement in and out of the city as long as travellers wear masks and keep their distance. Workplaces, shops and some public transport will reopen. Manila is home to 12 million people and is the centre of the nation\u2019s outbreak and efforts to battle the contagion.</p> <p>\u201cFor me, this does not look bad,\u201d President Rodrigo Duterte said in a televised address. He described the country\u2019s mortality rate as low and called for a move to the \u201cnew normal\u201d. Health minister, Francisco Duque, said 90% of the country\u2019s Covid-19 cases were \u201cmild\u201d.</p> <p>Manila\u2019s lockdown will this weekend surpass the 76-day quarantine of Wuhan, the city in <strong>China </strong>where the first outbreak of the coronavirus was detected. Manila\u2019s restrictions have hit the livelihoods of millions of workers and there is pressure to ease damage to an economy that is facing its deepest contraction in 34 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4be97355e91b379bb28b614be675fc47063390a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4be97355e91b379bb28b614be675fc47063390a7/0_108_2250_1350/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manila police trainees maintain social distancing on a train during an exercise in preparation for the resumption of public transport\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manila police trainees maintain social distancing on a train during an exercise in preparation for the resumption of public transport</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eloisa Lopez/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Globally, deaths stand at nearly 360,000, with 5.8 million cases.

The city has clocked up 43 cases this week, bringing its total to 119. How more than a dozen of the latest infections came about remains unclear.</p> <p>The mayor, Kenji Kitahashi, warned of a second virus wave and asked residents to refrain from non-essential outings. \u201cIf we leave this as it is, we will definitely be hit by a large second wave,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Several Middle Eastern countries eased restrictions on Friday. In Saudi Arabia a three-day transition to relative normality got under way, with malls and waterfronts open and the Kingdom readying to allow up to 90,000 mosques to receive worshippers on Sunday for the first time in nearly two months.</p> <p>In the United Arab Emirates, Dubai\u2019s beaches and parks reopened. The city\u2019s museums are expected to reopen their doors on Monday, as officials try to position the country as \u2018open for business\u2019 after the most crippling economic slowdown in the country\u2019s history.</p> <p>Both the Emirates and Saudi Arabia have been among the regional states most affected by Covid-19, with the virus taking an unprecedented toll on state revenues and forcing seismic shake-ups in labour markets and other key sectors.</p> <p>Balancing dwindling revenues and consumer confidence against a public health emergency has been particularly challenging for the UAE, one of the globe\u2019s main aviation hubs and an emerging tourist destination, the viability of which depends heavily on a pre-Covid interconnected world resuming on a similar scale.</p> <p>Both countries have enforced social distancing and have imposed curfews throughout the crisis. Numbers have increased steadily throughout the pandemic, with more than 32,500 cases registered in the UAE and more than 80,000 in Saudi Arabia. Migrant workforces account for large numbers of cases in each state. The ratio of deaths to contractions in each state is lower than the global average, at less than one per cent.</p> <p>In other global developments:</p> <ul> <li><p>Health officials in <strong>Moscow</strong> updated their figures on coronavirus deaths<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;On top of 636 deaths in April reported earlier, the health department added the deaths of 756 people who tested positive for the virus but died of other causes.</p></li> <li><p>In&nbsp;<strong>France</strong>, the prime minister said a ban on journeys of more than 100km (62 miles) would end on Tuesday, adding that cafes, bars and restaurants in so-called green areas \u2013 where the virus is not circulating widely \u2013 would be able to reopen on the same date.

Annual falls of about 7% are estimated to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/04/paris-climate-deal-world-not-on-track-to-meet-goal-amid-continuous-emissions\">needed to keep global heating within the Paris upper limit</a> of 2C above pre-industrial levels.</p> <p>The economic turmoil and disruption caused by the coronavirus is likely to result in a short-term drop in emissions, as it has so far this year across the world, but the longer-term impact is unknown.</p> <p>As people return to work, and governments try to stimulate the economy, emissions are likely to rise again, and some behavioural changes \u2013 such as avoiding public transport and the resumption of air travel on emptier planes \u2013 may increase emissions beyond the level of recent years if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/20/what-steps-can-the-uk-take-to-reach-net-zero-emissions-by-2050\">measures are not taken to rein them in</a>.</p> <p>This week, the UN decided to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/28/cop26-climate-talks-in-glasgow-will-be-delayed-by-a-year-un-confirms\">postpone vital talks on the climate crisis by a year</a>, from this November to November 2021. The hiatus is longer than many countries had wished, but was deemed necessary given the disruption caused by lockdowns.</p> <p>Green groups urged governments to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/28/uk-urged-to-tie-green-recovery-from-covid-19-crisis-to-cop26-summit\">link the recovery from the coronavirus with the need to reduce carbon, ahead of the Cop26 talks</a>, and said the year\u2019s delay must not be allowed to slow down action on the climate crisis.</p> <p>\u201cA 2.1% emissions drop isn\u2019t nearly enough to avert massive climate breakdown, and we absolutely cannot lose sight of the urgency of this task,\u201d said Aaron Kiely, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth. \u201cPostponement of the climate talks cannot come at the cost of international climate action \u2013 it doesn\u2019t give governments a get-out clause from their international responsibilities. There is a way out of both [the climate and coronavirus] crises if we collaborate, listen to the science, and stop losing time.\u201d</p> <p>Although the European commission set out its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/28/eu-pledges-coronavirus-recovery-plan-will-not-harm-climate-goals\">initial plans for a green recovery this week</a>, there is still no guarantee that member states will also take the actions needed to ensure long-term emissions reduction as the lockdowns ease.</p> <p>Mark Breddy, Greenpeace\u2019s EU spokesman, said: \u201cThere is a real risk that the EU\u2019s coronavirus recovery plan will be a lifeline for fossil fuels and other polluting sectors. We\u2019re already seeing governments pump billions into airlines and carmakers with no real green strings attached. To get back on track ahead of next year\u2019s climate summit, the EU needs to adopt a target to cut emissions by 65% by 2030, in line with the Paris agreement.\u201d</p> <p>The difference between the EU\u2019s emissions fall with the UK as a member state and the smaller decline without the UK\u2019s contribution also highlights how the EU will have to step up its efforts after Brexit. A large part of the UK\u2019s emissions cuts since 1990 came from an early switch away from coal to gas, but more recent falls have come from an increase in renewable electricity generation.</p>",

  "<p>The mayor of Minneapolis has accused Donald Trump of shirking responsibility and chided the president for insulting him on social media at a time of crisis in his city and the country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-minneapolis-minnesota-us-twitter-donald-trump-latest-news-live\">George Floyd killing: protests spread across US as Twitter hides Trump tweet 'glorifying violence' \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-minneapolis-minnesota-us-twitter-donald-trump-latest-news-live\">Protests</a> have erupted across the country over the killing of George Floyd, a black man, by a white police officer in Minneapolis, that was captured on cellphone video. The city has seen large-scale demonstrations and unrest, as protesters call for the officer who knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck and the three officers who were there during the incident to be criminally prosecuted. Protests, some marred by violence, have also broken out elsewhere in the US.</p> <p>But, tweeting about an hour after midnight in Washington, Trump launched a Twitter attack on Minneapolis\u2019s mayor, Jacob Frey.</p> <p>The president wrote: \u201cI can\u2019t stand back and watch this happen to a great American City, Minneapolis. A total lack of leadership. Either the very weak Radical Left Mayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together and bring the City under control, or I will send in the National Guard &amp; get the job done right.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>In a second tweet, Trump wrote: \u201cThese THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won\u2019t let that happen \u2026 Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter has since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">hidden</a> the second tweet behind a warning that it violated \u201cTwitter rules about glorifying violence\u201d, fanning the president\u2019s anger toward the social media company.&nbsp;</p> <p>Frey responded to the attack when a reporter read aloud Trump\u2019s tweets directed at him and the protests.&nbsp;\u201cLet me say this: weakness is refusing to take responsibility for your own actions. Weakness is pointing your finger at somebody else at a time of crisis,\u201d Frey said.</p> <p>The mayor shook his head when the reporter read that Trump called him a \u201cvery weak radical left mayor\u201d.</p> <p>Frey said: \u201cDonald Trump knows nothing about the strength of Minneapolis. We are strong as hell. This is a difficult time, yes, but you better be damn sure that we\u2019re going to get through this.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Late on Thursday night, the protests took a dramatic turn as a police precinct was set <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/george-floyd-minnesota-governor-national-guard-protests\">alight</a> by demonstrators. Police officers working in the precinct fled the building after unconfirmed reports that gas lines had been cut and explosives were in the area. Although no explosions went off in the night, the building continued to burn into the early hours of the morning.&nbsp;</p> <p>At the press conference, Frey said it was his call to evacuate officers from the building. \u201cThe symbolism of a building cannot outweigh the importance of life,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Frey also denounced the riots that were taking place in the context of the demonstrations.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWhat we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights is unacceptable. These are banks that people rely on to get cash, grocery stores that people rely on to get food. They are essential to our community.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier, Frey called on the district county attorney to arrest the officer who suffocated Floyd.</p> <p>\u201cIf most people, particularly people of color, had done what a police officer did late Monday, they\u2019d already be behind bars,\u201d Frey <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jacob_Frey/status/1265708253264195586\">tweeted</a> on Wednesday.</p>",
  "<p>The battle to lure tourists to the Mediterranean is hotting up with Cyprus declaring it will go one step further than its competitors, footing the bill for anyone whose holiday is ultimately ruined by coronavirus.&nbsp;</p> <p>The island says its decision to pick up the tab for infected tourists \u2013 providing free healthcare for Covid-19 patients and all hotel expenses for their dependents \u2013 will give it an unbeatable edge.&nbsp;</p> <p>Savvas Perdios, the deputy tourism minister, said: \u201cWe will cover the cost of hospitalisation of those who test positive during their holiday. And pay for their families and close contacts to be accommodated in quarantine hotels.\u201d</p> <p>While Britons are still banned from Cyprus, with local epidemiologists viewing Boris Johnson\u2019s handling of the disease as catastrophic, Perdios said he hoped UK visitors would be allowed back in by early to mid-July. \u201cThe relevant list is updated continuously,\u201d the tourism minister said.&nbsp;</p> <p>The only bills the Greek Cypriot government will not cover are those for repatriation flights and taxis to airports.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/25/life-after-lockdown-in-athens-parthenon-acropolis-marble-had-space-to-breathe\">Life after lockdown in Athens: 'The marble had space to breathe'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The gesture to foreign tourists was outlined in a five-page letter to airlines and tour operators announcing the health protocols&nbsp;the island will adopt when it reopens to air travel on 9 June. It had been well received, Perdios&nbsp;said. \u201cNeither Greece nor Spain will be able to do this with the tourism volume they\u2019ll have,\u201d he said. \u201ct\u2019s greatly appreciated by our partners abroad and is being seen as one of our strong points this summer.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>In the unprecedented era of coronavirus, the tourism industry is more desperate than ever to lure holidaymakers.&nbsp;In Sicily, the regional government&nbsp;is planning to&nbsp;pay for one of every three nights in hotels in a \u20ac50m (\u00a345m) scheme to attract visitors, including overseas tourists, while Spain\u2019s state-owned, high-end Parador chain of castles and stately homes, is offering giveaway stays for about \u20ac65 a night.&nbsp;</p> <p>Perdios admits the tourist industry has taken \u201ca massive hit\u201d this year. Although the island has successfully&nbsp;kept the pandemic in check, attracting visitors this summer is going to be a herculean task. In the Greek south there have been fewer than 950 confirmed coronavirus cases and 17 deaths, while the breakaway Turkish north proclaimed itself coronavirus-free several weeks ago. But with the former colony reliant on British tourists, Greek Cypriot officials say they will be lucky to get a third of the estimated 3.98 million people who visited last year.&nbsp;Perdios says recognition of good healthcare, including availability of intensive care units, will play a crucial role when Cyprus readmits&nbsp;travellers from countries with similarly low infection rates next month.</p> <p>With that in mind, 112 ICUs equipped with 200 respirators have been reserved for critically ill patients while a 100-bed hospital has been earmarked to cater exclusively for foreign tourists who test positive. A 500-room \u201cquarantine hotel\u201d for relatives and close contacts will also be set up.&nbsp;</p> <p>Like Greece, the island nation\u2019s economy is heavily dependent on tourism and plans are afoot to extend the season into the winter \u2013 to attract visitors from the UK and other nations still struggling with the virus.&nbsp;</p> <p>Letting any tourists in is a calculated risk.&nbsp;In the race to readmit them, Cypriot authorities are demanding that, initially, visitors carry health certificates proving they have tested negative for Covid-19 at least three days before departure.&nbsp;</p> <p>From 20 June, when flights from 13 other, mostly central and eastern European countries resume, the precautionary measure will be lifted.&nbsp;At all times social distancing will have to be observed, be it at the pool, in the bar, cafes or pubs, with guests encouraged to pay with contactless cards and hotel staff obliged to wear masks.&nbsp;</p> <p>On Friday, Athens\u2019s tourism ministry announced that from mid-June 29 countries would be able to resume air links with Greece. The list, which does not include nations still deemed to be Covid-19 hot-spots such as Spain, Italy and the UK, was broader than expected, reflecting the Greek government\u2019s desire to kickstart the vital industry. Taking a page out of Cyprus\u2019s tourism manual, Greece has quashed the idea of visitors having to be quarantined.</p> <p>But in the battle to entice a bigger share of the diminished tourism sector Athens has also gone one step better than Cyprus, nixing the notion of obligatory immunity certificates and announcing that&nbsp;spot coronavirus tests will be conducted upon arrival at airports instead.&nbsp;</p> <p>Popular islands that appear to have remained remarkably Covid-19 free are also joining the charm offensive, cutting prices at resorts and hotels with the aim of luring crowds when destinations are relinked to the outside world through direct international flights on 1 July.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>For the first time in decades, an overnight stay on the Cycladic isle jewel of Santorini will become affordable \u2013 even if industry figures say health protocols have added heavily to running costs.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be some discounts of between 15% to 25% to make resorts more attractive,\u201d said Antonis Iliopoulos, the president of local hoteliers.&nbsp;Occupancy rates on the volcanic island, long blighted by overtourism, are between 5% and 10% in late June.&nbsp;</p> <p>The party isle of Mykonos, whose prices last year surprised even the super-rich, is reportedly offering entire villas to rent for significantly low prices.</p> <p>Across the Mediterranean, industry figures concede that ultimately all eyes will be on Germany this year. The nation\u2019s habit of holidaymakers moving south in the summer months, combined with Berlin\u2019s relatively successful containment of Covid-19, has raised hopes \u2013 and with them ever more extravagant package tour offers.&nbsp;</p> <p>With Tui and other tour operators already aggressively promoting Greece, Cyprus, Spain and Portugal, hoteliers across the sea&nbsp;are hoping for a share of German tourism.</p>",

Now you hear it.</p> <p>Imagine again that you were scrolling through Twitter and stumbled across the image of a coronavirus victim, dead in a morgue.

There are countless more instances that go unnoticed and covered up because no one was there with a smart phone to capture the person\u2019s last moments. Sharing footage of these brutal events is no doubt a very powerful tool to have in our arsenal.&nbsp;But it seems to be the only tool.</p> <p>The problem is the last resort is your last resort because you\u2019ve got no more aces up your sleeve.

  "<p>My aunt, Eirian Evans, who has died aged 104, was the first female solicitor elected to the council of the Law Society.</p> <p>In 1973, she became the first female president of the Chester and North Wales Law Society. Although the battle to admit women to membership of the Law Society had long been fought and eventually won in 1922, the council of the Law Society remained an all-male bastion until Eirian was elected to it in 1977, representing Chester and North Wales. Four years later, when she stood down, the Law Society Gazette noted that she would be missed \u201cnot merely or mainly because she was the first woman member but because her contributions to the debates had always been both constructive and apt\u201d.</p> <p>Eirian was born into a Welsh-speaking home in St Asaph, Flintshire, the third of four children of Edward Owen Evans, a surveyor and sanitary inspector, and his wife, Edith (nee Brooks), and attended the local grammar school. Having studied law at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, she joined the firm of solicitors JR Williams of Abergele, where she remained for the whole of her working life.</p> <p>If Eirian\u2019s professional life was busy, her leisure time was no less so. She was a leading light in the Garthewin theatre company, which was housed in a large converted barn behind the 18th-century mansion of Garthewin, near Llanfair Talhaearn, Conwy. In 1947, Eirian became secretary of the company. She acted in many of the productions staged between 1937 and 1969, some of which were Welsh-language plays written by figures such as <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/saunders-lewis/\">Saunders Lewis</a> and Huw Lloyd Edwards, others Welsh translations of European classics. Her performances received warm praise from reviewers in the Welsh-language press: \u201cAll agreed that Eirian Evans was the star of the evening\u201d (Drama magazine) and \u201cOne of the best on our theatrical stage\u201d (Y Faner).</p> <p>Eirian contributed in other ways to the cultural life of Abergele. She was a member of an English-language amateur dramatic society in Rhuddlan, took an interest in local history, was a member of the Cambrian Archaeological Society and of the Soroptimists, and was instrumental in securing an Abbeyfield retirement home for Abergele.</p> <p>Eirian\u2019s older brothers, Berwyn and Llywelyn, and her sister, Myfanwy,&nbsp;predeceased her. She was a much-loved aunt to me and my siblings, Huw, Arthur and Joanna, and to the sons \u2013 Gerallt, Iwan, Alun (deceased) and Dafydd \u2013 of her cousin and close friend, Glenys.</p>",

Enoch Powell\u2019s brief time at Soas saw him learn Urdu so \u2013 the Conservative leadership candidate thought \u2013 he could some day become viceroy of India. But even after Soas shed that role, as Britain shed its empire, the school remained determinedly international, able to attract staff and students from around the world.</p> <p>As recently as 2005, the Guardian\u2019s university guide <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/apr/19/education.highereducation\">ranked Soas</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/apr/19/education.highereducation\"> as fourth-best</a> in the UK, ahead of its neighbours, King\u2019s College London and University College London.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/04/government-refuses-multi-billion-pound-bailout-for-universities\">Government refuses multi-billion pound bailout for universities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But while its physical location, alongside the British Museum, suggests permanence, its recent history is one of increasing uncertainty, eroded by the changes that have swept through higher education in England.</p> <p>One of Soas\u2019s specialities remains the languages of Africa, Asia and the Middle East. But the study of popular modern foreign languages, such as French and German, has been in decline in the UK for the past decade, as fewer pupils take them at school. That has left Soas\u2019s suite of language courses facing an even tougher domestic recruitment market.</p> <p>Teaching languages is also relatively expensive. In larger universities, cheaper and more popular courses, such as politics and law, cross-subsidise the costs of modern languages, but Soas is also a victim of its size. While it does offer popular courses such as law for undergraduates, the numbers are too small to offset the costs of language provision. While English universities have a median turnover of about \u00a3150m a year, Soas\u2019s is barely \u00a390m.</p> <p>Matters were made worse in 2015 when the government removed the cap on undergraduates numbers that had restrained individual university growth. Coupled with the \u00a39,000 tuition fee introduced in 2012, institutions suddenly had both the incentive and the means to recruit as many students as possible. Many grew rapidly, eating into Soas\u2019s pool of students at home and abroad.</p> <p>If a restructured Soas continues to struggle to attract students, the question will be if a government that wants to declare Britain open in a post-Brexit, post-coronavirus world can afford to let it close. The school still attracts policymakers from around the world for training, while the United Nations and other multilateral organisations are filled with its graduates.</p> <p>\u201cSaving Soas needs a political decision at some point, the government needs to decide that this institution is valuable. But everybody is really sceptical that this government would do that,\u201d said one academic.</p>",

What remains forever unbelievable is that Boris Johnson closed down <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/uk-to-start-coronavirus-contact-tracing-again\">contact tracing 11 weeks ago</a>: if he hadn\u2019t, we might have a European-level service \u2013 never mind his absurd \u201cworld-beating\u201d.</p> <p>From Monday, millions more return to work, often thrown into close contact with others, with no guarantee they will be safe.

  "<h2><strong>When will the Premier League restart?</strong></h2> <p>The league has set a provisional date for return of 17 June. That\u2019s a Wednesday, when two games would be played: Manchester City v Arsenal and Aston Villa v Sheffield United. They are the two fixtures left over from March. Once completed, all clubs will have played 29 games each. A full programme of fixtures would then follow at the weekend.</p> <h2><strong>When will the games be played?</strong></h2> <p>The plan is to complete all 92 remaining fixtures before 2 August, a deadline set by Uefa. That means there is going to be a lot of Premier League football in June and July. The published schedule for matches features games every day of the week, often at multiple times. The kick offs will be: Friday 8pm; Saturday 12.30pm, 3pm, 5.30pm, 8pm; Sunday 12pm, 2pm, 4.30pm, 5pm; Monday 8pm; Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday 6pm, 8pm.</p> <h2><strong>Where will the games be played?</strong></h2> <p>Mostly at stadiums of the home team, always behind closed doors. Concerns over the possibility of fans gathering outside grounds have led the police to request the following games take place at neutral venues: Manchester City v Liverpool, Manchester City v Newcastle, Manchester United v Sheffield United, Newcastle v Liverpool and Everton v Liverpool. The police have also asked that this list includes any match that may see Liverpool win the title.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <h2><strong>When can Liverpool win the title?</strong></h2> <p>With J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team 25 points clear of their nearest rivals Manchester City, Liverpool could win the league with their first fixture, the Merseyside derby. That would require City to have lost against Arsenal. Liverpool, whatever their rivals do, need two wins to seal their first championship in 30 years. How they will celebrate any win is to be decided, with the league drawing up plans for a physically-distant trophy lift.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/28/premier-league-restart-june-details-manchester-city-arsenal-aston-villa-sheffield-united\">Premier League plans restart on 17 June with Manchester City v Arsenal</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>What role will TV play?</strong></h2> <p>With no fans allowed into stadiums, the resumption will be made for TV. Every match will be shown live, the majority \u2013 64 of 92 \u2013 on Sky. The broadcaster has pledged to show 25 games free to air. BT Sport will show 20 matches but none will be free to air. Amazon will show four games and, in a first for the national broadcaster, the BBC will also show four Premier League matches live.</p> <h2><strong>What about the fans?</strong></h2> <p>Project Restart has involved no shortage of problems but the question of how any resumption should include the people who would have filled the stands has not been at the forefront. There may be cardboard cutouts of fans, as in Germany, there may be videos shown on big screens, but the interaction between fan and team will be lost. Most clubs have announced that ticket holders will be refunded for matches behind closed doors.</p> <h2><strong>What about the Football League?</strong></h2> <p>As it stands none of the three divisions beneath the Premier League have resolved what to do next. League Two clubs had voted to end the season, while League One remains divided over what to do and the Championship hopes to resume. The EFL has announced a meeting on 8 June at which a process for deciding on possible outcomes will finally be agreed.</p> <h2><strong>Could the restart still be stopped?</strong></h2> <p>The Premier League has always said it planned to resume competition when it was \u201csafe to do so\u201d. That is now felt to be the case after medical protocols were developed and approved by clubs and players. Any player or member of staff who tests positive for Covid-19 will be expected to isolate for seven days but plans as to what will happen should multiple players test positive are yet to be agreed. A broader resurgence of the virus in the country may also take the restart out of the league\u2019s control.</p>",
  "<p>It was 11pm on Sunday when Amy Fenton realised she needed to leave Barrow-in-Furness \u2013 and fast. She woke up her five-year-old, grabbed a few toys and bundled her in the car to flee the Cumbria town she has called home for the last 12 years. A police officer had called to say they had assessed dozens of threats made against her over the previous few days and thought there was now a credible risk to not just her life but her child\u2019s too.</p> <p>As chief reporter for the Mail, Barrow\u2019s daily newspaper, Fenton, 35, had made a few enemies over the years. People would usually rather she wasn\u2019t sitting on the press bench when they were found guilty of drink driving or beating their wives. She became hardened to the abuse, even when a local man, Leroy McCarthy, was <a href=\"https://www.holdthefrontpage.co.uk/2020/news/man-jailed-for-20-weeks-after-threatening-to-rape-terrified-reporter/\">jailed for 20 weeks</a> in February for threatening to rape her, after she wrote about the Muslim convert\u2019s terrorism conviction for threatening to blow up Furness general hospital.</p> <p>But she was not prepared for what happened last week after the Mail published her report about a 19-year-old woman from Barrow charged with lying about being abused (her name was later taken off the article due to the volume of abuse she was receiving). Just 279 words in length, the story said the woman had appeared in court charged with seven counts of perverting the course of justice. The charges related to seven allegations of rape, sexual assault and sex trafficking made against five different men between 2017 and 2019.</p> <p>The woman \u2013&nbsp;whose name and partial address the Mail published, as it always does when someone appears in court unless reporting restrictions apply \u2013 was remanded in custody to await a crown court trial and sent 100 miles away to Wakefield prison.</p> <p>By this point most of Barrow had already heard the woman\u2019s name. She had become the subject of a huge social media storm last week after a long and distressing Facebook post in her name detailed abuse she is said to have suffered this month and for years at the hands of Asian men in towns across the north of England. The Mail had already reported her claims, albeit anonymously.</p> <p>Two days later, she appeared in court, charged with breaching her bail, imposed after she was charged with perverting the course of justice back in March.</p> <p>Legally, that is all the Guardian (or indeed anyone) can say about the woman\u2019s case. As it is now \u201cactive\u201d, under the Contempt of Court Act, no one is allowed to publish anything that could prejudice jurors at her trial.</p> <p>The law applies to everyone, not just journalists, but many of the people who started threatening Fenton for her reporting on the case do not understand this, she said. They have alleged she is in bed \u2013 sometimes literally \u2013 with the men the 19-year-old accused. They were incensed after she wrote a piece last week <a href=\"https://www.nwemail.co.uk/news/18467274.this-ruined-lives---mithali-takeaway-boss-barrow-reveals-impact-untrue-assault-allegations/\">interviewing an Indian takeaway owner</a> who said they had to temporarily close their business after receiving death threats following rumours of an Asian grooming gang in Barrow.</p> <p>Some of those threatening Fenton suggested that because she is from Blackburn-with-Darwen, Lancashire, which has a large Asian population, she is \u201cin\u201d this rumoured gang. Yet Cumbria police says it conducted a year-long, independently peer-reviewed investigation and found no evidence such a gang existed.</p> <p>In a video statement, Ch Supt Dean Holden said he had to be \u201cvery careful ... because I don\u2019t want to undermine any judicial processes\u201d but \u201cwhat I would say is when the question is asked, \u2018Is there an organised gang of Asian men in Barrow conducting abuse and exploitation against individuals?\u2019 - our investigation has shown that has not been corroborated or otherwise evidenced.\u201d</p> <p>In addition, the force said it was investigating a new allegation that \u201ccirculated on social media concerning reports of physical and sexual abuse committed against a woman, aged in her late teens\u201d in Barrow.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This wouldn\u2019t happen if the threats were made against emergency workers. Something needs to change</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Fenton, now holed up in a secret location outside Cumbria, says she and her colleagues have reported more than 100 threats against her. Cumbria police confirmed it was investigating and on Thursday \u2013&nbsp;as a crown court judge refused the 19-year-old\u2019s application for bail and Barrow\u2019s Labour and Conservative councillors <a href=\"https://www.nwemail.co.uk/news/18480277.council-rivals-unite-call-calm-barrow/\">put out an unusual joint statement</a> appealing for calm \u2013 the fire service was fitting anti-arson letterboxes to her and her ex-husband\u2019s homes, she said.</p> <p>She says she wants police to use the \u201cfull force of the law\u201d against those who have threatened her family. It was when people began to involve her daughter \u2013 with one person suggesting she pimped her out to paedophiles \u2013 that she decided she wanted them to be prosecuted. \u201cFor the last two or three years, I took the stance that I was happy enough if the police just went round and spoke to people and told them it\u2019s not acceptable, but that is not enough now. If people don\u2019t feel the consequences of this behaviour, it won\u2019t stop.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier in the year Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, responsible for media policy, wrote to Fenton after hearing about the abuse she had suffered, before this alleged grooming scandal blew up.</p> <p>She wants the government to crack down on those who threaten journalists: \u201cThis to me is the last straw that highlights that there is such little protection for us journalists. Up until the guy who threatened to rape me [McCarthy] the consistent message from the police when I reported it was that they had to balance these individuals\u2019 right to freedom of speech and expression with my right to be safe. In my mind, this wouldn\u2019t happen if the threats were made against emergency workers. Something needs to change to give us better protection.\u201d</p> <p>The National Union of Journalists has issued a statement condemning threats against her, and Fenton insists she will not be cowed from doing her job. \u201cNothing is ever going to stop me wanting to be a journalist, ever. It was my dream from the age of about eight and I love my job.</p> <p>\u201cI love the way we are in a position to help people. It\u2019s not just reporting court cases and when bad things happen. I love that we can champion people\u2019s causes and fight for decency and morality and fairness, even though there is never anyone fighting for us.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 May 2020 to clarify that Fenton\u2019s byline was subsequently removed from the article about the 19-year-old woman charged with lying about being abused.</p>",

  "<p>When lockdown began, I took up running. Regular runners may remember those first few agonising jaunts \u2013 where the background noise of the world disappears and the only sound is your heaving breath, the only sensation your aching feet (and bruised pride, at being outpaced round the ponds by an unleashed sausage dog).</p> <p>Perhaps that\u2019s why on my third, stitch-filled run, I didn\u2019t know what time it was when I found myself on the home stretch. I didn\u2019t know why, as I huffed up the road, people were in their front gardens clapping, their faces alight. The penny dropped: it was a Thursday. It must have turned 8pm. We were clapping for the NHS. And as I stopped to join the applause of people actually worthy of it, I chuckled about my brief thought that somehow they might be clapping for me.</p> <p>I keep dreaming about this. Sometimes the cheering becomes jeering, sometimes I recognise the faces. L<strong>i</strong>ke many in lockdown, I have noticed an uptick in vivid dreams, despite having always had them. My favourite ones are comic: I dreamed that instead of breasts sagging with age, they floated upward, wreaking havoc with people\u2019s eyelines. My worst dreams dredge up unresolved moments, like seeing the faces of friends I\u2019ve lost touch with. (I\u2019ve long believed friend endings are the worst because they\u2019re unnecessary. Unlike romantic partners, where you can only have one, it\u2019s fine to have multiple friends with some in \u201cfriend storage\u201d.

  "<p>Do you remember the ABC movement a few years back, when we were all asking restaurants for anything but chardonnay (while still, typically, claiming that we liked chablis, which is, of course, made from the chardonnay grape). Now it seems that ABSB (anything but sauvignon blanc) would be more appropriate, although I know it has its die-hard fans.</p> <p>Supermarkets love the stuff, because it sells by the crateload, but there are so many more interesting wines out there to enjoy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/sep/09/almost-famous-less-well-known-wines\">my latest enthusiasm being aligot\u00e9</a>. Some of you may shudder at the thought, remembering the tooth-strippingly acidic wines of your youth, made drinkable only by adding a good slosh of cassis. These days, however, there are some very fine examples, as I was reminded recently by a young French importer, L\u00e9a Delacourcelle of <a href=\"https://dejabuwines.co.uk/\">D\u00e9j\u00e0 Bu Wines</a>.</p> <p>Delacourcelle, who comes from Burgundy, had the misfortune to start her tiny business supplying restaurants at the end of last year, so she is now selling to the public directly. She, too, has a passion for aligot\u00e9. \u201cYou get some top producers playing with it, because there are fewer restrictions on how you can make it and you can have a bit of fun,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The wines are similar in character to chablis, but have a pure, thrilling, linear intensity to them. I particularly like the mouth-tingling fresh acidity of <strong><a href=\"https://dejabuwines.co.uk/online-shop/domaine-chevrot-bourgogne-aligote-quatre-terroirs-2018\">Cuv\u00e9e des Quatre Terroirs 2018</a></strong> (12%) from Domaine Chevrot \u2013 although, at \u00a318.99, it is not inexpensive. The Ch\u00e2teau de Rougeon in today\u2019s panel, however, is well worth a whirl, particularly if you can find some wine-loving neighbours to pitch in with you.</p> <p>If you are into this kind of ultra-dry white, which perfectly suits lighter, summery food, you are spoilt for choice. France also offers muscadel and picpoul, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/may/19/albarino-the-iberian-peninsulars-greatest-white-grape-spreads-its-wings\">Spain albari\u00f1o</a> (alvarinho in Portugal) and Austria peppery gr\u00fcner veltliner, which goes with practically anything. Italy is awash with good-value whites, including (and perhaps unexpectedly) those from the warmer south of the country, such as falanghina, greco di tufo and Sicily\u2019s carricante. Most Greek whites are as sharp and salty as feta, too \u2013 look out for assyrtiko from Santorini. Basically, where there is an island, there is a seafood-friendly white.</p> <h2>Four crisp, fresh whites that are not sauvignon blanc</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Line spacing\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 12px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"987f9c989c2d2e8bf0e5a5c645a30d57b265cd20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/987f9c989c2d2e8bf0e5a5c645a30d57b265cd20/0_0_4111_4111/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reinosa blanco\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Marques de Reinosa </strong><strong>Rioja </strong><strong>Tempranillo </strong><strong>Blanco 2018 </strong>\u00a38.95, <a href=\"https://jeroboams.co.uk/product/2018-marques-de-reinosa-blanco-rioja-blanco-bodegas-marques-de-reinosa-bottle/\">Jeroboams</a>, 12.5%.

Ensure daily good news.</p> <p>Thank you, Dominic Cummings. Any pretence that lockdown is led by \u201cthe science\u201d has always been rubbish. It has been an exercise in social control by an initially panic-driven government. However laudatory its aim, its execution has been driven by graphic predictions validated by highly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/wrong-coronavirus-world-scientists-optimism-experts\">selective science</a>. Now it is hurting people and hurting him. This is politics.&nbsp;</p> <p>The great populist fallacy is that all a leader needs to claim consent is to win an occasional election. Then anything goes. Philosophers from John Locke to John Stuart Mill have stressed that democracy also requires a <a href=\"https://blog.supplysideliberal.com/post/2018/6/17/the-social-contract-according-to-john-locke\">continuing contract</a>, in which the state receives the trust of the people by trusting them in turn, rather than enslaving them.&nbsp;</p> <p>This week we have learned that Britons will accept extraordinary \u2013 indeed unprecedented \u2013 state control over their private and working lives if they can be made to feel their security is under threat. They will tolerate absurdity and blatant unfairness. Beaches may be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/gallery/2020/may/25/uk-crowds-enjoy-may-sunshine-lockdown-eases-in-pictures\">opened to the crowds</a>, but mountains must be closed off. Off-licences may open but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/10/the-guardian-view-on-closed-churches-a-necessary-sacrifice\">churches must shut</a>. Fines have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/bame-people-fined-more-than-white-population-under-coronavirus-laws\">levied disproportionately</a> to some groups over others. Garden centres were lethal but supermarkets not. In all honesty, these were the killjoy reflexes of bureaucrats on a control binge.&nbsp;</p> <p>All this was based on a government policy decision, that such blanket controls were vital to avert a disaster. Such trust is an inherent feature of stable western democracies. It is notable that, during the pandemic, faith in elected leaders has been equally strong where they have pursued lockdown as where they have not, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/15/europe-emerges-lockdown-question-hangs-was-sweden-right\">as in Sweden</a>. The message is clear. Democrats naturally trust elected governments in time of stress, irrespective of the policy.&nbsp;</p> <p>That trust is delicate. Insult it and consent collapses. In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/27/public-health-trust-dominic-cummings-second-wave\">Cummings affair</a>, he may seem hard done by. Anyone could sympathise with his and his wife\u2019s predicament. But he called the policy\u2019s bluff. He too found the rules imposed by his own regime to be authoritarian and intolerable. When blanket rules came face to face with Kant\u2019s crooked timber of humanity, as they did in a wood near <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/26/a-site-for-sore-eyes-how-dominic-cummings-put-barnard-castle-on-the-map\">Barnard Castle</a>, trust and consent both disintegrated. Cummings was that crooked timber, and the public howled its rage.</p> <p>The Johnson team now seems out of its depth. Grasping at science has become grasping at a passing lifebelt. As lockdown wanes, the policy variation within the UK as well as across Europe is not between different sciences but between different politics. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/groups-up-to-six-people-allowed-meet-england-monday-coronavirus-lockdown-easing\">Six English people</a> equal eight Scots.

It seems increasingly plausible that differences in national death rates are due not to variants in the severity of lockdowns, but to variants in government care and treatment of the elderly. In other words, they depend not on infectiousness but on domestic health policies.</p> <p>Either way, Britain\u2019s policy on coronavirus has clearly been disastrous. The press might trumpet America\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/us-coronavirus-deaths-toll-1000000\">100,000 deaths</a>. But America is a big country and, on the most sensible generalised measure of \u201cexcess deaths per million\u201d, Britain\u2019s rate is not just three times America\u2019s but possibly the worst in the world, at 890 against American\u2019s roughly 250. Even its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b4c784e-c259-4ca4-9a82-648ffde71bf0\">deaths per million</a> are higher than America\u2019s.&nbsp;</p> <p>Johnson and Hancock remain in denial over the apparent reasons for this, that thousands of Britons appear to have died after being ejected or turned away from NHS hospitals, either dumped into care homes or having vital operations postponed. Thousands more may have died at home, through being terrified by Johnson into not seeking hospital care at all.&nbsp;</p> <p>This saga is approaching its end and there must be a reckoning. Perhaps some lives have been saved by lockdown. If so, it is strange that countries that rejected it, from Sweden to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/19/liberal-dutch-taiwan-coronavirus-covid-19-netherlands\">Taiwan</a>, have seen a lower death rate than Britain. Meanwhile the longer lockdown lasts, the faster its cost rises towards the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/bank-of-england-to-finance-uk-government-covid-19-crisis-spending\">staggering total of \u00a3200bn</a>. How many lives might that have saved?&nbsp;</p> <p>With budget deficit now predicted to reach <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f0c7ab6d-33ba-4777-8dd8-0960a78a556a\">17% of GDP</a>, Britain now faces a double humiliation: the world\u2019s highest coronavirus death rate and the worst resulting economic collapse. Johnson likes blood-curdling \u201cworst-case scenarios\u201d. Mine is that this will prove to be Britain\u2019s most catastrophic and costly policy failure in modern times. If so, I hope a memorial plaque to the demise of responsible Toryism is fixed to a certain Barnard Castle tree.</p> <p>\u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist</p>",

But the game was won in a blitz after the interval when they crossed twice before the Bunnies had mentally left the sheds. </p> <p>The Rabbitohs rallied and were the better team for large portions of the second half but this Roosters outfit has shown over a number of years that they are formidable defensively, and even with the fatigue of a first game back in ferociously fast conditions they stood firm.</p> <p>James Tedesco did James Tedesco things, scoring a beautiful solo try and gaining 295m - almost 100m more than anyone else on the field. Jake Friend led all comers for tackles and his captain\u2019s challenge late in the game was the decisive turning point, especially after he followed it up soon after with his own kick-chase try. </p> <p>That score showed up Latrell Mitchell, who had a mixed night under the spotlight against his former side. His fast hands in the line helped create his side\u2019s opening try, but he was found wanting positionally and fumbled one bomb. </p> <p>Stay tuned for more NRL action right here as sport slowly eases its way back into life following the Covid-19 shutdown.

We\u2019re underway at Bankwest Stadium around 7.55pm local time.</p> <p>As I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware by now, footy\u2019s back! How are you feeling about it? Let me know on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jphowcroft?lang=en\">@JPHowcroft</a> or email: <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com\">jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com </a></p> <p>I thought last night\u2019s restart went as well as could be expected, once Brodie Croft chilled out prematch anyway. I am an advocate for the piped crowd noise. I thought that aspect was delivered very well indeed, and with the long passages where the camera didn\u2019t pan to empty rows of seats you could easily be forgiven for being hoodwinked into thinking it was business as usual.</p> <p>But clearly this is not business as usual, and not just in the staging of the competition. On the pitch these two heavyweights arrive with plenty of questions to be answered. The Roosters have set the standard over the past two seasons but went winless in their two fixtures before lockdown. The Rabbitohs went one from two but then found themselves at the centre of plenty of unwanted attention during the hiatus with Cody Walker suspended for two matches for an incident that resurfaced from back in December, while Latrell Mitchell <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/27/police-investigate-nrl-stars-josh-addo-carr-and-latrell-mitchell-over-social-media-post\">reminded the world </a>rugby league players don\u2019t always make the best life choices.</p> <p>Which is a nice segue into tonight\u2019s match-up, which is of course Mitchell\u2019s first appearance for the Bunnies against the Chooks, the side he left in the offseason following a soap opera of negotiations that ended with the star landing nearby, but crucially in his preferred fullback role. He\u2019s probably the only person in the country pleased that fans are unable to attend tonight\u2019s match. </p> <p>But there\u2019s plenty more to consider when the longest rivalry in the history of Australian rugby league resumes. The Roosters should be close to full strength with skipper Boyd Cordner making his first start of the campaign, and he will line-up alongside experienced new recruit Josh Morris. They will be looking to avoid becoming the first premiers to go zip-three since 2009, and only the third in the NRL era. </p> <p>Let\u2019s get it on!</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_bJf3foa5I\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V_bJf3foa5I?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>There\u2019ll be plenty of echos around the Bunnymen at a deserted Bankwest Stadium tonight.

I\u2019m going to hand you over to my colleague <strong>Sarah Marsh</strong> in London. Here\u2019s the latest from the Minneapolis protests: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Protests against police brutality have continued in cities across the US, including Minneapolis, Denver, New York and Oakland following the killing of George Floyd. </strong>Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died in police custody after a white officer handcuffed hum kneeled on his neck for several minutes as Floyd pleaded that he could not breathe.</li> \n   <li><strong>In Minneapolis, police abandoned the 3rd precinct police station, which has been a major protest site.</strong> Crowds breached the station and set the entrance on fire. Elsewhere, businesses were looted and blazes set as the evening wore on.</li> \n   <li><strong>Donald Trump tweeted about the protests, calling those involved \u201cthugs\u201d and threatening to send in the national guard.</strong> Trump described the city\u2019s mayor, Jacob Frey, \u201cvery weak\u201d and wrote: \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>In response, to the president\u2019s comments, Frey said during a press briefing: \u201cWeakness is pointing your finger at someone else during a time of crisis.\u201d</strong> The city\u2019s mayor said he had ordered the evacuation of officers from the 3rd precinct after reports of \u201cimminent threats to both officers and the public\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Minnesota National Guard </strong><strong>sent 500 soldiers to St Paul, Minneapolis and surrounding areas after the state\u2019s governor</strong><strong> declared a state of emergency. </strong>Governor Walz wrote in the proclamation that he supported peaceful protests but \u201cunfortunately, some individuals have engaged in unlawful and dangerous activity, including arson, rioting, looting, and damaging public and private property\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>The US attorney\u2019s office and the FBI in Minneapolis said earlier on Thursday they were conducting \u201ca robust criminal investigation\u201d</strong> into the death and making the case a priority. The FBI is also investigating, focusing on whether Floyd\u2019s civil rights were violated.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T07:01:07.860Z\">at 8.01am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed0b0908f0898700351e5e2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T06:50:08.046Z\">7.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Frey faced questions about the apparent absence of police and the National Guard on the city\u2019s streets. He was pointedly asked by one reporter: \u201cwho is in charge?\u201d. He directed questions about the role of police to the city\u2019s commissioner, but called the protests \u201cunacceptable\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Frey:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that, our entire city recognises that. What we have seen over the past several hours and past several nights in terms of looting is unacceptable. Our community cannot and will not tolerate it ... We are working with our officers right now of course, with resources provided by the state ... It was clear as of last night [that] we needed additional help and we got that, some form the state and we are expecting more as well.\u201d </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed0aee28f0898700351e5de\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T06:44:43.759Z\">7.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Frey, in that press conference just now, also addressed the decision to abandon the city\u2019s third precinct police station. He said he made the order for police to evacuate the building, which it appears has since been significantly damaged by fire, after reports of \u201cimminent threats to both officers and the public\u201d</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The symbolism of a building cannot outweigh the importance of the lives of our officers or the public.

Louisville, Kentucky, as protesters turned out to demand justice for <strong>Breonna Taylor</strong>, a black woman fatally shot by police in her home in March.</p> \n  <p>It comes amid demonstrations across the country following the death of a black man, <strong>George Floyd</strong>, in Minneapolis police custody.</p> \n  <p><strong>Louisville Metro Police</strong> confirmed in a statement early Friday that there were at least seven shooting victims, at least one of whom is in critical condition. The statement said there were some arrests, but police didn\u2019t provide a number. Police had initially confirmed reports of gunfire around 11:30 p.m.</p> \n  <p>Police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington told The Associated Press that all seven were civilians. Around 500 to 600 demonstrators marched through the Kentucky city\u2019s downtown streets on Thursday night, the Courier Journal reported. </p> \n  <p>Understandably, emotions are high, Louisville Mayor <strong>Greg Fischer</strong> tweeted just before midnight, sharing a Facebook post asking for peace that he said was written on behalf of Taylor\u2019s mother. </p> \n  <p>Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical tech, was shot eight times on March 13 after Louisville narcotics detectives knocked down the front door. No drugs were found in the home.</p> \n  <p>Attention on Taylor\u2019s death has intensified after her family sued the police department earlier this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of <strong>Ahmaud Arbery</strong> in a Georgia neighborhood in February. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed09c758f084e882655acf5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T05:24:53.075Z\">6.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As the US grapples with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/george-floyd-minnesota-governor-national-guard-protests\">third night of protests</a> over the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, here is what we know so far:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/george-floyd-protests-what-we-know-so-far\">George Floyd protests: what we know so far</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed09aed8f087e3ca0f65835\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T05:22:38.991Z\">6.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85e45214b5100392da2ba230044752fa9fa6a972\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85e45214b5100392da2ba230044752fa9fa6a972/0_182_4946_2967/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unrest continues over the death of George Floyd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unrest continues over the death of George Floyd</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Maturen/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aedf20a97152427c41e1f15d458c41885aa4cb1a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aedf20a97152427c41e1f15d458c41885aa4cb1a/0_322_4895_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters look at a burning liquor store across the street from the Minneapolis Police Department 3rd Precinct during protests over the arrest of George Floyd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters look at a burning liquor store across the street from the Minneapolis Police Department 3rd Precinct during protests over the arrest of George Floyd</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tannen Maury/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4afc770b9a3c05f099855d9771caadf6eeaa455\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4afc770b9a3c05f099855d9771caadf6eeaa455/0_232_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters gather around after setting fire to the entrance of a police station as demonstrations continue in Minneapolis\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters gather around after setting fire to the entrance of a police station as demonstrations continue in Minneapolis</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Barr\u00eda/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed099698f084e882655acec\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T05:11:54.922Z\">6.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Minneapolis mayor <strong>Jacob Frey</strong>: \u201cWe all need to work together to ensure the safety of our friends, family, and Minneapolis residents.

  "<p>Anxious sixth-formers trying to decide which university offer to accept are finding little clear information to steer them, with vice-chancellors saying they are still not able to promise anything like the usual experience of lectures, seminars, nightlife \u2013 or even shared kitchen and dining spaces in halls.</p> <p>Would-be freshers who have received offers will be asked to confirm a firm <a href=\"https://www.ucas.com/undergraduate/after-you-apply/types-offer/replying-your-ucas-undergraduate-offers\">first choice by 18 June</a>. Last week <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-52709516\">Nicola Dandridge</a>, chief executive of the Office for Students, told MPs that before a student accepted a place, universities must provide \u201cabsolute clarity\u201d about what their experience of starting during the pandemic would be like. But many vice-chancellors say this is unrealistic and are hedging their&nbsp;bets for fear of \u201cover-promising\u201d.</p> <p>The head of a university in the elite Russell Group says: \u201cWe can\u2019t honestly be clear where we will be in four months\u2019 time. And there are legal implications if you say \u2018yes, you\u2019ll be here attending seminars and staying in halls,\u2019 and then that can\u2019t happen.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b7074e73e096970b9fe71b3aee68a6d0cfe93a19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7074e73e096970b9fe71b3aee68a6d0cfe93a19/508_0_2289_2288/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colin Riordan, vice-chancellor of Cardiff University\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colin Riordan, vice-chancellor of Cardiff, says universities are being careful not to over-promise.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cardiff University</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Prof Colin Riordan, the vice-chancellor of Cardiff University, another Russell Group member, says: \u201cWe are fortunate that we aren\u2019t regulated by the OfS so we can safely ignore what they are saying. Our regulator in Wales is being much more pragmatic and not asking us to do what we can\u2019t do.\u201d</p> <p>Universities are devising plans for how to open up their campuses again in the autumn \u2013 not least because they are worried that thousands of new students might otherwise try to defer their places.</p> <p>Mike Taylor, a computer programmer from Ruardean, Gloucestershire, says his youngest son, Jonno, who wants to be a composer, is now unsure about whether to press ahead with studying music at Lincoln University, a course he feels is \u201cabsolutely perfect\u201d for him.</p> <p>While Taylor is not convinced small-group teaching is safe, he is most saddened about what his son\u2019s social experience of university would be like. \u201cIf you go to study music, you want to sing in choirs, form bands, do gigs in the student union, and so on. None of that can happen safely,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cThe big concern is that university is one of those things you get one shot at. If Jonno goes now, he burns his precious three years, and accumulates his huge debt, for what can only be a substandard experience.\u201d</p> <p>Simon Marginson, professor of higher education at Oxford University, says that faced with an online start, many students\u2019 instincts will be to defer, or to \u201ctake their chances\u201d on admission in a future year. \u201cStudents will be more sharply aware of a diminished offering at university than the struggle to find work in a recession, which they have yet to fully experience,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Riordan, meanwhile, says universities are hoping that by September regulations will have relaxed enough for freshers to have a campus-based experience, even if it looks and feels very different because of distancing rules. But he says no one knows for sure whether there will be a resurgence of the disease, or what the regulations will be at that time.</p> <p>\u201cMost of us are being pretty cautious, as over-promising or giving students misinformation would be far worse,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbbd5d902fc64c141cc18310917fa72e54d29a86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbbd5d902fc64c141cc18310917fa72e54d29a86/0_304_5976_3586/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicola Dandridge, head of the Office for Students\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicola Dandridge, head of the Office for Students, says students need \u2018absolute clarity\u2019 before accepting an offer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/19/cambridge-university-moves-all-lectures-online-until-summer-2021\">Cambridge</a>, <a href=\"https://www.manchester.ac.uk/coronavirus-applicants-update/\">Manchester</a> and Nottingham Trent universities have all confirmed that they will be delivering lectures online, at least for the first semester, with hopes to deliver small-group teaching face-to-face. Riordan agrees large group teaching by September is likely to be \u201cout of the question\u201d and says small-group contact would be \u201cthe easiest thing to fix\u201d.</p> <p>Other elements of the plan are trickier. \u201cWhat you can\u2019t put online so easily are things like chemical practicals, which need a lab, or teaching doctors and dentists, where there really needs to be personal interaction and training. We have to find a way around that as we clearly can\u2019t stop training doctors.\u201d</p> <p>Like most universities, Cardiff has mapped out one-way systems around its buildings similar to those in supermarkets. Extra toilets are being commissioned in car parks.</p> <p>However, one of the questions keeping Riordan awake at night is how the university will ensure that young people, who have been among the most likely to flout social distancing rules, take the plan seriously.</p> <p>\u201cWe may get people to sign an agreement as a condition of being on campus. We have to do everything we can to avoid an outbreak.\u201d His team is talking to lawyers about this.</p> <p>While parents and staff want reassurances about safety, he believes many students are still hoping for a first term of socialising and parties. He advises a reality check: \u201cWe won\u2019t have the same sort of nightlife anywhere in the country.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/22/thousands-of-a-level-students-could-lose-their-unconditional-university-offers\">Thousands of A-level students could lose their unconditional university offers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, some universities, sensing that many students will want a campus-based experience, are aiming to deliver lectures in person. Worcester says that to keep numbers down it will alternate students between those attending in person and those watching online, and will also offer smaller face-to-face classes.</p> <p>Its vice-chancellor, Prof David Green, says he is determined to have in-person teaching wherever possible, because \u201cresearch is already showing that students from disadvantaged backgrounds have found it hardest to progress their studies during the lockdown\u201d.</p> <p>The head of Aston University, Prof Alec Cameron, says: \u201cCambridge announced no lectures, but their model has always been that lectures are a voluntary element. Most of the sector still relies on lectures as a core component.\u201d</p> <p>However, Cameron estimates that a 200-person lecture would need to be cut by about two-thirds to comply with social distancing, and his university doesn\u2019t yet know how to achieve that.</p> <p>Another big challenge, he says, will be working out with its private provider how halls will function, with their shared living, kitchen and dining spaces. \u201cIn the short term it may be difficult to provide some of those arrangements under strong social distancing requirements,\u201d he admits.</p> <p>Cameron says: \u201cWe have to be open about the uncertainty that is attached to our good intentions. We are saying that we will be enrolling and commencing students in September. But at the heart of our decision making, our top priority will be whether it is safe for students and safe for staff.\u201d</p> <p>Smita Jamdar, head of education at the law firm Shakespeare Martineau, wants the OfS to \u201cdial back\u201d its demands. \u201cRight now, with universities under the most extraordinary pressure, they seem to be expecting more of them than they would in normal times.\u201d</p> <p>However, Colin McCaig, professor of higher education at Sheffield Hallam University, says universities can\u2019t keep would-be students in the dark much longer. \u201cIt\u2019s a circle that has to be squared. Universities need to come out and put their sticker up on the window and say \u2018Hey, this is what you\u2019re getting.\u2019 Only then can consumers make a proper choice.\u201d</p>",

His wife Maggie (Lisa Kudrow) cries brokenly when he tells her they will be moving from Washington DC to start a new life and&nbsp;a space&nbsp;base in Colorado.

Except that he doesn\u2019t have any dignity. He is, for the most part, a buffoon but with enough moments of competence (and despair and frustration at the failures of those around him) to confuse the issue. He has a receptionist who keeps infuriatingly forgetting to warn him who is waiting in his office (the tiredest of jokes to begin with) but he is also dim-witted enough himself \u2013 we are meant to believe, of this man who otherwise seems to be a perfectly normally functioning father, husband and four-star general \u2013 to insist that a chimpanzee be trained to fix a satellite in&nbsp;space&nbsp;rather than let the scientists come up with a workable solution.&nbsp;</p> <p>Above all, despite occasional laughs to be gleaned from the twist that Malkovich can give the most unpromising of lines, Space Force is not funny, which makes it hard to class as a comedy.</p> <p>The first episode is worth watching purely because it contains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/16/fred-willard-best-in-show-this-is-spinal-tap-dies-aged-86\">Fred Willard</a> as Naird\u2019s father, in his last role.

The men\u2019s 4x400m, the final event at Japan\u2019s National Stadium, had <em>everything</em>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/28/running-with-deer-in-park-helped-dina-asher-smith-to-stay-in-shape\">Running with deer in park helped Dina Asher-Smith to stay in shape</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With Britain\u2019s Roger Black finishing just five hundredths of a second behind the USA\u2019s Antonio Pettigrew in the individual event, the hope was that the underdogs could keep the favourites honest. </p> <p>Despite Derek Redmond holding the British record, the in-form Black was the presumptive anchor attraction. So when word circulated that not only was Black on the <em>first</em> leg, with John Regis \u2013 who had run in the 4x100m final just 90 minutes earlier \u2013 also down to run, it sounded duff.</p> <p>And yet Black, groomed like a Chariots of Fire extra, <em>was </em>lead-off. Redmond, a prodigious talent rendered sporadic due to thighs seemingly strung with cheese rather than ham, was up second. Regis would seek to melt minds with a keg-chested third-leg presence, before Kriss Akabusi \u2013 the Timmy Mallett of track and field \u2013 took on Pettigrew.</p> <p>Some thought had gone into this. Regis had an overlooked flying lap to his name as part of a rampant 4x400m victory at the 1990 European championships, unofficially timed at 43.93sec \u2013 Iwan Thomas\u2019s 23-year-old British record is 44.36. Still, Andrew Valmon, Quincy Watts, Danny Everett and Pettigrew were markedly superior regardless of the order. Adding up the best marks each runner would ever achieve individually, the USA were three and a half seconds quicker.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=Sport&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=My%20Favourite%20Game&amp;description=In%20our%20new%20series%2C%20Guardian%20writers%20recall%20the%20great%20sporting%20contests%20they%20will%20never%20forget&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsport%2Fseries%2Fmy-favourite-game&amp;links=false\" data-alt=\"My favourite game\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=Sport&opinion-tint=false&title=My%20Favourite%20Game&description=In%20our%20new%20series%2C%20Guardian%20writers%20recall%20the%20great%20sporting%20contests%20they%20will%20never%20forget&read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsport%2Fseries%2Fmy-favourite-game&links=false\">My favourite game</a> <figcaption>My favourite game</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Black was undeniably a strong kick-off for British hopes, but Valmon, fifth in the individual final, fought gamely from the gun. As the track\u2019s stagger unwound, the two handed over more or less simultaneously. Britain needed Redmond to find form.</p> <p>He steamed away from 21-year-old Watts, who was enjoying a barnstorming debut season in the event. But though not yet the athlete who would blister the Barcelona straight in 1992, Watts was a cool head, cruising past his increasingly ragged rival. \u201cHas the British gamble failed?\u201d pondered David Coleman.</p> <p>Yet Regis clung doggedly to his man, even hinting at an attack. Honours ended up even, though the smooth-striding Everett glided round as if on castors, while the solidly carved sprint specialist noticeably sagged in his final strides. For this reason, Regis released Akabusi early in the changeover zone after a fine \u201c390m\u201d in the words of his anchor runner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cab13c6f530e7ec39d4847e1829adaba09701fbc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cab13c6f530e7ec39d4847e1829adaba09701fbc/0_94_2929_1758/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Derek Redmond, John Regis, Roger Black and Kriss Akabusi after being awarded their gold medals.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Derek Redmond, John Regis, Roger Black and Kriss Akabusi after being awarded their gold medals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gray Mortimore/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Akabusi adopted a lean-shoe stance \u2013 almost exaggeratedly attentive to his rival\u2019s movements. And though the American looked comfortable, Akabusi cornered wide to apply pressure that immediately told. Pettigrew\u2019s rolling style became a flail, his desperation to reclaim the lead depriving him of all rhythm. Though the slowest of the four British legs, every one of Akabusi\u2019s glorious, unthinkable 410m provided plenty for his latterday motivational speaking career.</p> <p>Within the year normality was restored, with Valmon and Watts among the USA quartet that savaged the world record at the Olympics. Black and Regis had Olympic and world silvers in their future respectively; awaiting Akabusi was Barcelona bronze and replacing Roy Castle as host of Record Breakers.</p> <p>Derek Redmond\u2019s Olympic ambitions memorably crumpled in a heap <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/nov/30/50-stunning-olympic-moments-derek-redmond\">halfway round his 1992 semi-final</a>, overshadowing Everett\u2019s final bow at Games level in the race that immediately followed as the American\u2019s foot gave way.

  "<p>For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer; as we\u2019re told by countless officiants in ceremonies across the years, marriage is not to be entered into lightly. But nothing tests a partnership quite like a crisis.</p> <p>It\u2019s something that Chantelle Miller and her wife, Tara Miller, can attest to. The pair, who both serve in the military, have not seen each other for two months since the Covid-19 pandemic hit the UK \u2013 they are key workers at the forefront of the fight against the virus.</p> <p>Chantelle is currently working as a military planner in Wales with the Cardiff and Vale University health board, while her wife\u2019s roles include that of first responder with the South Central Ambulance Service on the south coast of England. Both were awaiting deployment when the pandemic struck, and having previously served in Afghanistan and Northern Ireland, they knew they were likely to be called up to work as part of the home emergency.

We made sure we had things in place, should the worst happen,\u201d says Chantelle. \u201cWe made sure we had means of communication and we were prepared.\u201d</p> <p>Thankfully, a long history in the armed forces had taught them to be ready for anything. After studying law and criminology at university, and having initially wanted to join the police, Chantelle chose the military. \u201cI was attracted by the career, travel and essentially because no two days are ever the same,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Tara signed up aged 19, as she had family connections to the forces. \u201cI always wanted to join the military,\u201d she says. \u201cMy grandma was a nurse, and my grandad was<br>a medic in the Royal Marines. My great-great-great uncle was a bomb disposal expert in the second world war. I loved hearing all their stories as a child.\u201d</p> <p>Despite both working in the same sector, theirs wasn\u2019t an office romance. Instead, they bonded over a rugby match, having played \u2013 on opposite teams \u2013 in a game back in 2012. While they can\u2019t remember the result, they did have a post-game drink. \u201cWe\u2019re both big rugby fans,\u201d says Chantelle. \u201cAnd we just got talking after the match. Soon after, Tara got deployed to Afghanistan, but we kept talking. Then eventually, after I\u2019d worked in Germany, we both got posted back to the UK, and that\u2019s when we got together.\u201d</p> <p>They were married in 2017 and say that being forced to spend much of their relationship apart has strengthened their bond \u2013 and unwittingly prepared them for the self-isolation they currently find themselves in.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re coming up to four years married, and for that time, I\u2019ve been deployed in different jobs that have taken me away from the family home for about one and a half years,\u201d says Chantelle.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely weird being deployed \u2013 it\u2019s challenging and dangerous but it\u2019s harder on the person who\u2019s been left at home, trying to keep on with normal life. The dog needs to be walked, the daily monotony continues while the other person is off<br>doing something that they\u2019re really passionate about. It can be difficult, it comes with a particular strain, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019re both aware of and we always put our jobs first. That might surprise a few people, and it might be an issue for some marriages, but not for us. We know the type of people we are \u2013 we both want to help others, and we never want to hold each other back.\u201d</p> <p>Shortly after the country went into lockdown on 23 March, the Millers were assigned their new duties as a Military Aid to the Civil Authorities request (MACA). Even they were surprised at the speed in which the pandemic took hold, and how quickly they were drafted in.</p> <p>\u201cI got the call on Friday, 27 March and I was deployed the next day,\u201d says Chantelle. \u201cI did training on Sunday and I was working on the ground doing crisis management with the health board on Monday. I know it\u2019s only a small part of what\u2019s going on, but we both wanted the opportunity to work as part of it.\u201d</p> <p>While Chantelle\u2019s day-to-day role at HQ includes working with contingency plans, crisis management and supporting testing operations \u2013 such as antibody testing and contact tracing \u2013 her wife is at the centre of the health crisis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f385327c227a37a47743f78d755c1ca3f7d08435\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f385327c227a37a47743f78d755c1ca3f7d08435/0_294_1139_772/1000.jpg\" alt=\"SSgt Tara Miller\" width=\"1000\" height=\"678\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">SSgt Tara Miller</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tara works as part of the patient transport service, putting in gruelling 12-hour shifts from Southampton general hospital, taking people back to their homes in Portsmouth, Bournemouth and the surrounding areas.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an emotional rollercoaster,\u201d says Tara. \u201cYou\u2019re happy that you\u2019re taking patients home, but you have to go to the ward where the patients are and that really brings home the reality that there are very ill people, of all different ages, alone in the hospital. It\u2019s really, really sad. It does get to you, and if it didn\u2019t, you wouldn\u2019t be human.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a different kind of distress, Tara says, than serving in other countries. \u201cIn Afghanistan, for example, there\u2019s the language barrier \u2013 you can only read people\u2019s body language and I think you can tell a lot from someone\u2019s eyes. But working with Covid-19, because you speak the same language as the patients you get very emotionally involved. It\u2019s similar, but because it\u2019s on your doorstep and because it could happen to you or your loved ones, it makes it that little bit harder.\u201d</p> <p>That work has been even more difficult in the days before this interview, Chantelle explains, as Tara has been dealing with the death of her grandad. \u201cShe found out he had passed away when she was working on a shift, and in her typical way, she just carried on working,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m just so, so proud of her.\u201d</p> <p>However, it\u2019s the glints of light in dark experiences like this that drive people such as Tara on. She has witnessed some uplifting moments in the pandemic firsthand. \u201cThere was a 75-year-old ex-serviceman who had just got over coronavirus.

  "<p>Unhinged as it may be for the president to accuse, without a scintilla of evidence, a morning television host of murder, that particular conspiracy theory was not the most disturbing accusation to issue from Trump\u2019s Twitter feed this week. No, that prize goes to his tweet from 26 May, claiming:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged &amp; even illegally printed out &amp; fraudulently signed \u2026 This will be a Rigged Election. No way!</p> </blockquote> <p>The president\u2019s defamation of Joe Scarborough is no more than an extreme version of something we have seen throughout Trump\u2019s tenure in office:&nbsp;his ability to deflect attention from one colossal misstep by simply committing a fresh outrage.&nbsp;The fact that even a handful of Republicans have expressed mild regret at Trump\u2019s bizarre accusation only underscores that it has served its instrumental purpose. For the moment, the news cycle is consumed not with the fact that 100,000 Americans have died in a pandemic that the White House recklessly insisted posed no threat; instead, all attention is riveted on the spectacle of a sitting president accusing an opponent in the \u201clame stream media\u201d of homicide.&nbsp;</p> <p>Trump\u2019s attack on mail-in ballots, by contrast, is far more ominous. Here, the president is defaming not an individual but the integrity of our electoral process, confidence in which is a key to a stable democratic order. And the purpose of this attack is not distraction but pointedly political. The politics of disenfranchisement has emerged as a staple of Republican electoral strategy, and the reasons for targeting mail-in ballots are not hard to divine. The bulk of such ballots are cast in urban areas, where Democratic voters predominate, and as the nation continues to grapple with the Covid-19 outbreak, we can expect millions of urban voters to cast mail-in ballots in November as a hedge against the obvious health risks that come with in-person voting. Trump\u2019s tweets serve, then, the politics of voter suppression.&nbsp;</p> <p>But that is only one aspect of the dark logic behind the tweets. Far more alarmingly, Trump\u2019s attack on the reliability of mail-in votes establishes the groundwork for a radical refusal to acknowledge electoral defeat. In contrast to ballots cast in-person on 3 November, mail-in ballots often cannot be fully counted until several days after the election. This means that in a very tight race, the results announced on election day may be no more than provisional; and second, because of the demographic patterns I mentioned above, the full counting of ballots may well swing the outcome in the favor of Democratic candidates.&nbsp;</p> <p>The 2018 Arizona senatorial race witnessed a particularly dramatic case of this effect, dubbed the \u201cblue shift\u201d by election law expert Ned Foley. On election day, Martha McSally, the Republican candidate, enjoyed a 15,000-vote lead over her Democratic rival, Kyrsten Sinema. By the time the state\u2019s canvassing had ended, however, McSally found herself defeated by Sinema by some 56,000 votes \u2013&nbsp;a swing of 71,000 thousand votes.&nbsp;</p> <p>Trump is more than familiar with the phenomenon of blue shift. Also in 2018, when the senatorial race in Florida saw Republican Rick Scott\u2019s lead over Bill Nelson shrink from over 56,000 on election day to an uncomfortable 10,000 by the time the state completed its canvass, Trump had urgently tweeted:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott\u2026in that large numbers of ballots showed up from nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged. An honest vote count is no longer possible\u2014ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p>Recall that in 2016, Trump\u2019s margin of victory over Hillary Clinton was a <em>combined</em> 70,000 votes in the swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. It is more than possible that Trump could narrowly capture these states on 3 November, only to see his victory vanish as mail-in ballots are tallied in the days following the election. His tweet from Tuesday tells us how he would respond to such a loss. He will reject it as a product of fraud. That is an eventuality \u2013 or even a certainty \u2013 that the nation must prepare itself for.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><p>Lawrence Douglas is the author, most recently, of Will He Go?

  "<h2>Monday</h2> <p>When I first heard that Dominic Cummings was giving a press conference about his midnight flit to Durham, I had to check with my better-informed colleagues on the politics desk that this wasn\u2019t a wind-up. After all, it\u2019s specifically against the special advisers\u2019 code of conduct for them to make public statements. Let alone one in the formal setting of the Downing Street rose garden that had previously been used as the setting for David Cameron and Nick Clegg\u2019s 2010 bromance party celebration. But the Cummings show was every bit as box office gold, from his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/i-think-i-behaved-reasonably-dominic-cummings-defends-actions-in-lockdown-row\">refusal to apologise for anything</a> \u2013 Classic Dom could pick a fight in an empty room. There was his admission that he went back to work after his wife fell ill, his belief that having to look after his own child constituted exceptional circumstances, his inability to explain how he and his wife led people to believe they had stayed in London in their Spectator articles, his complaint that the cottage on his father\u2019s farm had been rather basic for his liking. But the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/26/a-site-for-sore-eyes-how-dominic-cummings-put-barnard-castle-on-the-map\">trip to Barnard Castle</a> for his wife\u2019s Easter Sunday birthday treat was obviously the highlight. Imagine our finest political brains having had six weeks to come up with a cover story and not being able to do better than an eyesight test. I tweeted that back in the 1970s, I used to take the car for a test drive to see if I was too stoned for a longer journey. The tweet was read by an old friend who pointed out that at least my excuse had the virtue of being true. And that I hadn\u2019t conducted my driving experiments with a four-year-old child in the car. Rather there had been a 21-year-old child behind the wheel.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/28/boris-johnson-sacrifices-top-scientific-advisers-on-altar-of-classic-dom\">Boris Johnson sacrifices top scientists on altar of Classic Dom | John Crace</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>History has a habit of repeating itself. For many years, the first that my wife and I remembered of our wedding anniversary was when a card from my mother arrived through the letterbox. Now it\u2019s me who has to remind my daughter of her wedding anniversary. We had been chatting over the weekend and she was insistent her anniversary was on the Monday. I was equally insistent that it was today, Tuesday. Obviously you can tell from the fact I am including this in the diary that I turned out to be right. Not something my daughter was happy to admit. Then she wasn\u2019t the one who had got a phone call 10 days before her wedding saying she was planning to get married in the kitchen of her parents-in-law in Minneapolis and that we were welcome to come if we wanted but she didn\u2019t mind if we didn\u2019t. Not being keen to miss out, my wife and I hastily booked a couple of days off work along with flights to the US. Having been told that the ceremony was due to take place at 10am, we dragged our jet-lagged bodies out of bed at about 9.15am and went upstairs to find that no one else in the house was awake. 10am came and went and still there was no sign of anyone. It wasn\u2019t until half an hour later that any of the in-laws \u2013 not to mention the bride and groom \u2013 put in an appearance. Still, when the wedding did eventually take place it was worth the wait and I cried throughout. That said, I have to confess that the main reason I was so certain my daughter hadn\u2019t got married on the Friday as she was claiming was that it had coincided with the Saturday of the Champions League final, which I had watched on my own as everyone else had a nap before going out in the evening.</p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>If, as many had previously said, Tory MPs were reserving their judgment on the prime minister\u2019s decision not to sack Dominic Cummings until after his appearance before the liaison committee \u2013 the supergroup of select committee chairs \u2013 then I can only assume they were watching a different session to me. For only a handful more came out to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/27/list-grows-of-tory-mps-calling-for-cummings-to-resign\">say Dom should go</a>. What I saw was a prime minister who was totally unprepared and out of his depth. Not just on the Cummings affair, about which his basic message was that he wasn\u2019t bothered if his key adviser had broken the rules or not, it was just time to move on \u2013 something that will have come as a huge relief to the families of the 60,000 people who have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/uk-coronavirus-deaths-weekly-covid-19\">likely died in the UK</a> as a result of the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 but also on significant other areas of government policy, such as the benefits system. There again, it\u2019s not just me who is having problems understanding why so many Tory MPs are standing by Boris and Dom when it is clear they believe there is one rule for the elite and another for the rest of us. A friend who lives in Jeremy Hunt\u2019s constituency wrote to the former foreign secretary to ask how he reconciled his support. He replied that, as far he was concerned, Dom had broken the government guidelines on three separate occasions but he wasn\u2019t going to make too much of a fuss about it. Presumably because he had a career to worry about. My friend wrote back, pointing out that this was bigger than party loyalty: if Dom could be seen to be getting away with it, then thousands of others would follow suit and the death toll would get even larger. Hunt replied once more saying he had said all he was going to say and it was time to move on for the good of the country. So it seems the country is expected to act on conscience and moral principles that are absent within government.</p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>With the slight easing in lockdown measures \u2013 more, one suspects, out of Boris Johnson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/28/boris-johnson-sacrifices-top-scientific-advisers-on-altar-of-classic-dom\">desire to move the story on</a> from Cummings rather than a significant fall in the reproduction rate or the readiness of the new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/test-and-trace-undermined-by-cummings\">test-and-trace system</a> \u2013 the rest of the summer begins to take on a more familiar feel. Sort of. Instead of the Euros, from 17 June the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/28/premier-league-restart-june-details-manchester-city-arsenal-aston-villa-sheffield-united\">Premier League will resume</a> behind closed doors. Obviously I\u2019m pleased, but not as pleased as I thought I would be and I can\u2019t work out if my lack of enthusiasm is because Spurs\u2019 season had in effect ended before the lockdown anyway or if it\u2019s because I\u2019ve got used to there being no live sport. Either way, it\u2019s likely to be a rather surreal experience with no supporters to create any atmosphere. Just before the lockdown I watched the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/mar/12/olympiakos-v-wolves-europa-league-last-16-live\">Olympiakos v Wolves</a> game that was played in an empty stadium in Athens and I can\u2019t remember ever feeling so semi-detached during a football match. Even the players didn\u2019t look that interested and appeared to be just going through the motions. To mitigate the deadening effect of no noise, there are rumours the Premier League is planning on piping in fake chants through stadium PA systems. If so, I very much look forward to hearing \u201cthe referee\u2019s a wanker\u201d when a blatant foul is missed and, my own personal favourites \u2018Is there a fire drill?\u2019 and \u2018We can see you sneaking out\u2019 that always come towards the end of a game when one set of fans knows their team have lost and leave early to avoid both the queues and having to hear rival fans rubbing their noses in it.</p> <h2>Friday</h2> <p>Another sign of things returning to something like normality is that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/28/the-proms-to-go-ahead-this-summer-but-not-as-we-know-them\">the Proms</a> are making hopeful noises about being able to put on some kind of much reduced programme. Assuming they are not just planning to broadcast highlights of previous years\u2019 concerts, I can\u2019t see quite how it\u2019s going to work as to observe proper physical distancing rules \u2013 wind and brass players can spread a lot of spit over a large area \u2013 it sounds as if the orchestra will have to spread out over the whole of the Albert Hall. Which would not only make for weird acoustics but would not leave much room for an audience. Perhaps they are just going to do a whole season of string quartets. Rather more bizarrely, the Turner prize judges have already decided <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/may/26/turner-prize-cancelled-and-chosen-artists-to-get-10k-bursaries\">not to announce a winner this year</a> and to give bursaries to those who made the shortlist instead. This just seems bonkers, given the judges have already seen the works and that they don\u2019t need to be viewed by the public for a winner to be chosen. Still, there\u2019s much about the Turner prize that I\u2019ve never understood. Most notably why a ceramicist \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/dec/08/arts.turnerprize2003\">Grayson Perry in 2003</a> \u2013 has only once won the prize. I can think of at least four potters who would have been more than worthy winners and none of them even made the shortlist. Britain is world famous for its studio potters and yet they consistently go unrecognised by the art world at home. It\u2019s as if ceramics is considered to be lower in the cultural hierarchy: a craft rather than an art form. Allow me to disagree. The pots that I own \u2013 and those that I don\u2019t \u2013 have brought me far more joy than any number of paintings and installations in Tate Britain and Tate Modern.

  "<p>British Airways is proposing to outsource work being done by at least 450 employees it is making redundant.</p> <p>The Labour party said the proposals were \u201cdisturbing news\u201d and called for the government to scrutinise the plans, revealed by the Guardian.</p> <p>The airline, owned by International Airlines Group (IAG), is also considering closing its operation at Heathrow\u2019s Terminal 3 completely and shrinking its footprint at Terminal 5, the Guardian understands.</p> <p>Terminal 3 \u2013 which operates BA short-haul routes across Europe and long-haul destinations including Cape Town and Miami \u2013 carried about 15% of BA\u2019s Heathrow traffic before the pandemic. Terminal 3 has been mothballed during lockdown, with all BA flights running from Terminal 5 on dramatically reduced schedules.</p> <p>BA, which has received state aid worth hundreds of millions of pounds, proposed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/british-airways-plans-to-make-up-to-12000-staff-redundant\">cutting as many as 12,000 jobs last month</a> in response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Among the thousands of job cuts, the proposals include plans to make at least 450 workers at Heathrow redundant before outsourcing the work they did, according to a person with knowledge of the proposals.</p> <p>BA has said job cuts are necessary because passenger numbers are expected to be significantly lower for as long as four years, meaning demand will be lower.</p> <p>Moody\u2019s Investor Service, the influential credit ratings agency, on Thursday downgraded its rating on IAG and BA debt from investment-grade to junk bond status \u2013 meaning it faces higher borrowing costs \u2013 underscoring the financial difficulties facing the airline sector with the vast majority of planes still grounded.</p> <p>However, the proposals to outsource the jobs of furloughed workers performing operations still required by the airline prompted criticism.</p> <p>Jim McMahon, the shadow transport secretary, said: \u201cThe government should have done more to protect these jobs. We cannot see roles which are currently paid through the job retention scheme outsourced.\u201d</p> <p>Jobs at risk in the outsourcing proposals include ticketing services, returning lost baggage to passengers and planning the balance of weight in the plane, known as centralised load control. Load control is currently carried out by teams in offices in London and Prague. The team in the Czech Republic is run by Air Dispatch, a third party supplier who would become a prime contender for some offshoring work.</p> <p>The outsourcing and potential offshoring proposals come despite IAG receiving British government support worth hundreds of millions of pounds. IAG has borrowed \u00a3300m from the Bank of England\u2019s Covid corporate finance facility. The government is paying 80% of the salaries (up to \u00a32,500 per month) of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/british-airways-expected-to-lay-off-36000-staff-amid-coronavirus-crisis\">30,000 furloughed BA workers</a>, support worth \u00a335m to the company in April alone.</p> <p>Nadine Houghton, national officer for the GMB union, which represents some BA workers, said: \u201cBA\u2019s actions so far have been deeply cynical and opportunistic. Taking taxpayer money through furlough and Covid loans and then offshoring hundreds of jobs to other countries is about as unpatriotic as you can get. This behaviour from our national flag-carrier is unacceptable.\u201d</p> <p>A BA spokesman said: \u201cWe are acting now to protect as many jobs as possible. The airline industry is facing the deepest structural change in its history, as well as facing a severely weakened global economy.</p> <p>\u201cWe are committed to consulting openly with our unions and our people as we prepare for a new future.\u201d</p>",

I remember laughing so much at school that I frequently had to clutch my front bottom to stop the wee coming out. This was once triggered by the girl standing next to me farting very loudly during assembly \u2013 seriously, she let off as loudly as a trumpet at the precise moment we\u2019d all finished singing a hymn. I still call this state of helpless incontinent hilarity \u201cschool assembly\u201d laughter, and when I\u2019m gigging, this is the Richter-scale level of laughter I\u2019m after. I want to see every woman in the audience crossing her legs and clutching her front bottom.</p> <p>In real life, of course, wetting yourself as an adult is the stuff of nightmares, immediately you are the primary school pant wetter, the girl who had to borrow a pair of knickers from the lost property box, oh the shame of it.</p> <p>The fact is, losing control of your bladder can happen for all kinds of reasons, from simple timing issues, ie finding yourself locked out of the house and not being able to find your front door key, to suffering from various medical conditions that affect bladder control.</p> <p>For some reason, adult female incontinence still tends to be a taboo subject, although there probably isn\u2019t a female comic who hasn\u2019t gone through motherhood without making an \u201cevery time I cough, I wet my pants\u201d stress-incontinence gag. A few years ago, during a Grumpy Old Women Live show, I performed some menopausal material about having a go on a kids\u2019 trampoline: \u201cThirty seconds later, I\u2019d pissed myself, broken both my ankles and one tit had escaped its moorings,\u201d I joshed. And judging by the reaction of the audience, a great many of them had been there, done that and had to go home to change their underwear.</p> <p>In my experience, as long as we women are in control of the joke then we can laugh about it. It\u2019s when other people (often younger and frequently male) take ownership of our physical frailties that it becomes embarrassing and somehow more shameful.</p> <p>For many women over 50, a little bit of leaking now and then is a fact of life \u2013 many of us haven\u2019t got the toned pelvic floors we once had, thanks mostly to having big headed babies, and while some of us will never need to use pads, others feel safer with some protection, \u201cjust in case\u201d.</p> <p>As a woman who has spent more than her fair share of time on the motorway sharing cars with other female performers, it has always surprised me how some women need to stop at a service station to use the loo every 20 minutes, while others manage a good five hundred miles without needing a wee.</p> <p>The fact is that all bladders are different, some resemble oversized leather footballs, while others, like my friend Nina\u2019s (I\u2019ve changed her name) are thimble sized and made from gossamer. Nina has never managed to make it to the interval of any show without climbing over everyone\u2019s laps to get to the ladies.</p> <p>For a number of women, bladder training can be incredibly useful. A friend of mine swears blind that Princess Anne once informed her that \u201cwhen one urinates, one must always sit for another 30 seconds after you think you\u2019ve finished, as you inevitably haven\u2019t, there\u2019s usually a few drops more\u201d. This is singly the best tip for anyone suffering from post-micturition dribble. Basically, slow down and give yourself time to do the job properly. Then \u201cgive your lettuce a good shake\u201d as the old saying goes and remember to wipe from front to back, because we don\u2019t want a yeast infection on top of everything else.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/the-last-taboo/2020/may/14/i-had-to-let-my-body-heal-gemma-atkinson-on-becoming-a-mum\">'I had to let my body heal': Gemma Atkinson on becoming a mum</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lord knows, women are born with complicated plumbing and as we get older some of our pipework can start to drip now and then, but you know what?

  "<p>Beginning with my rape at 14, sex has been a disturbing, sometimes violent and always unfulfilling experience. To the outside world, I have it together: a solid job I am good at, a caring ex-partner and two beautiful children. Yet, all my attempts at intimacy have been fraught with shame, secrecy and a lack of authenticity.</p> <p>Most recently, I reconnected with an older man I met four years ago. I rebuffed his advances first time round; for reasons I am still unsure of, I pursued him this time. I thought the disclosure of my vulnerability and my history of abuse would ensure he would treat me respectfully and with care. I was wrong. The sex felt forceful and, during oral intercourse, I became so distressed that my bladder, weakened by childbirth, lost control and I wet the bed.</p> <p>A week after our night together, he stopped initiating contact. Though my rational mind understands how unhealthy the experience was, the feeling of abandonment is strong.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/18/my-life-in-sex-my-wife-wants-a-desire-free-old-age-but-i-still-see-her-as-my-sexual-partner\">My life in sex: \u2018My wife wants a desire-free old age.

sector to ensure viability and capacity during the Covid-19 response.</p> \n  <p>The impact of the pandemic on government revenue as a result of related economic parameter variations also remains significant, with receipts nearly $20bn lower than the 2019-20 MYEFO profile.</p> \n  <p>This is driven by below profile collections across both income and indirect taxes.</p> \n  <p><strong>The

Some were at a big national global scale, but some of them are just saving a great footy club.

The international community has a significant and long-standing stake in Hong Kong\u2019s prosperity and stability. Direct imposition of national security legislation on Hong Kong by the Beijing authorities, rather than through Hong Kong\u2019s own institutions as provided for under Article 23 of the Basic Law, would curtail the Hong Kong people\u2019s liberties and, in doing so, dramatically erode Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and the system that made it so prosperous. </p> \n   <p>China\u2019s decision to impose the new national security law on Hong Kong lies in direct conflict with its international obligations under the principles of the legally-binding, UN-registered Sino-British Joint Declaration. The proposed law would undermine the One Country, Two Systems framework. It also raises the prospect of prosecution in Hong Kong for political crimes, and undermines existing commitments to protect the rights of Hong Kong people \u2013 including those set out in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. </p> \n   <p><strong>We are also extremely concerned that this action will exacerbate the existing deep divisions in Hong Kong society; </strong>the law does nothing to build mutual understanding and foster reconciliation within Hong Kong. Rebuilding trust across Hong Kong society by allowing the people of Hong Kong to enjoy the rights and freedoms they were promised can be the only way back from the tensions and unrest that the territory has seen over the last year.</p> \n   <p><strong>The world\u2019s focus on a global pandemic requires enhanced trust in governments and international cooperation. Beijing\u2019s unprecedented move risks having the opposite effect.</strong></p> \n   <p>As Hong Kong\u2019s stability and prosperity are jeopardised by the new imposition, we call on the Government of China to work with the Hong Kong SAR Government and the people of Hong Kong to find a mutually acceptable accommodation that will honour China\u2019s international obligations under the UN-filed Sino-British Joint Declaration.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T22:00:08.635Z\">at 11.00pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed02b088f0898700351e311\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T21:23:38.239Z\">10.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Courier Mail reports <strong>Nathan Turner,</strong> who died at his Blackwater home on Tuesday, and then later tested positive for Covid-19 (he had not previously been tested) <a href=\"https://www.news.com.au/world/coronavirus/australia/coronavirus-nathan-turner-held-party-days-before-dying-from-covid19/news-story/69f8e4fc9a6500f03c351e2bf548bf14\">and his partner held a party at their home four days earlier. <br></a></p> \n  <p>The 30-year-old had been showing respiratory illness symptoms for some time before his death.

  "<p>Alexandra Shulman\u2019s introduction to her charming memoir opens with an inventory of her wardrobe. It is a disarming tactic, as if to say: \u201cSee, I have socks, bras and knickers just like you\u201d \u2026 although most of her readers will probably not be able to match the four fur tippets and five full-length evening gowns; nor the 81 pairs of footwear.</p> <p>Each chapter concentrates on an item of clothing or a colour and what it means to Shulman, who recalls her first party dress (navy poplin, puff sleeves with pink piping); her wedding dress (white, long sleeves, by Ghost; navy Valentino slip dress for a later wedding party thrown by her parents Drusilla Beyfus and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/may/25/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries2\">Milton Shulman</a>); and what she wore to Westminster Abbey when Catherine Middleton married Prince William (navy again, with a headpiece by Kate Halfpenny \u2013 don\u2019t call it a \u201cfascinator\u201d; Shulman wouldn\u2019t).</p> <p>The narrative is relaxed and easy but never gossipy \u2013 readers wanting lurid details of the uncomfortable changeover of editorship at Vogue, when Shulman departed and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/21/edward-enninful-vogue-meghan-markle-criticism-racist\">Edward Enninful</a> took over, will be disappointed. However, she does allow a slightly steely tone to creep in when she writes that although few profiles of her are without a mention of her weight, no comment is ever made about his.</p> <p>Shulman\u2019s relaxed self-confidence is what makes her seem so relatable \u2013 a normal figure in an industry not noted for its tolerance of those with breasts, stomachs and bottoms. Hence the furore over her 2017 Instagram post of herself in a bikini: a mature woman not covering herself up! But the guarded tone ensures that we might know exactly what is in her sock drawer, but are kept at arm\u2019s length emotionally.</p> <p>Her background was in newspapers although she did time at Tatler, the determinedly \u201chigh society\u201d magazine; when she became editor of Vogue in 1992, sales figures \u201chad been thought of as to some extent irrelevant\u201d. That changed under her guardianship. She wanted it to be \u201cbeautiful and accessible\u201d, and by the time she left she had increased circulation and made \u00a3200m profit for the owners, Cond\u00e9 Nast.</p> <p>It is a shame that there are no colour photographs \u2013 of her rose-print Prada skirt or Erdem gunmetal shift \u2013 but it is clear from the reproduction of her leaving card, with its \u201c101 Ways to Wear a White Shoe\u201d, that what counts for Shulman is not fashion but style.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Clothes \u2026 and Other Things that Matter is published by Cassell (RRP \u00a316.99).

  "<p>Billie Jean is not cancelled. Whatever personal arrangement you may have come to regarding the life and music of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/michaeljackson\">Michael Jackson</a>, the culture at large has made its decision. In radio stations, gyms, cafes and wedding dancefloors (at least when they were open) certain of his songs have been deemed too good to lose, and Billie Jean tops the list. On one level that makes sense: it\u2019s Jackson\u2019s biggest-selling solo single, and one of the biggest hits by anyone ever. Yet it remains a thoroughly bizarre record, spawned in the darker precincts of Jackson\u2019s imagination.</p> <p>Billie Jean was his Rubicon. From <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/oct/09/how-we-made-the-jackson-5-i-want-you-back-tito-marlon\">the Jackson 5\u2019</a>s first singles through to Off the Wall\u2019s hymns to the weekend, Jackson had a preternatural gift for making people feel good. Billie Jean, however, reeks with the paranoia that came to dominate Jackson\u2019s career. It is a hunted, haunted song about a paternity claim, which forsakes the lushness of his earlier work for stark, neurotic future-funk. While Thriller\u2019s title track is cartoonishly scary, Billie Jean is authentically <em>scared</em>.</p> <p>Thriller was the first time that Jackson acknowledged his celebrity in his songs, and perhaps the last time that his celebrity didn\u2019t define his music. He wrote Billie Jean in 1981, a sweaty year for the famous. In the aftermath of John Lennon\u2019s murder and the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan by a Jodie Foster obsessive, celebrities learned to fear their fans. According to producer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/feb/22/quincy-jones-greatest-ever-moments-ranked\">Quincy Jones</a> and biographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/aug/02/michael-jackson-biography-review\">J Randy Taraborrelli</a>, Jackson himself was stalked by a disturbed young woman who claimed that he had fathered her child. Taraborrelli claims that she sent the star a package containing a gun and instructions for a suicide pact. Jackson, however, traced the song\u2019s theme back to the groupies who pursued his older brothers in the Jackson 5. \u201cThere were a lot of Billie Jeans out there,\u201d he said in 1996. \u201cEvery girl claimed that their son was related to one of my brothers.\u201d Either way, in Billie Jean, sex is a trap, especially if you\u2019re famous. The dancefloor, an arena of liberation on Off the Wall, becomes a place of peril and exposure. They dance on the floor in the round. Everyone is watching but what are they seeing?</p> <p>The song\u2019s paternity is not in doubt. Michael was the only Jackson brother to learn the craft of record-making from their producers during the 1970s, and all the basic components are there in his 1981 demo. When he brought it to the Thriller sessions, however, Jones worried that the title might lead people to picture tennis player Billie Jean King and suggested changing it to Not My Lover. He wasn\u2019t sure about the bassline either, which proves that even great producers can have moments of idiocy. When he tried to abbreviate the instrumental intro, Jackson protested, \u201cBut that\u2019s the jelly!\u201d \u2013 the funk. On every count, Jackson prevailed.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi_XLOBDo_Y\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Zi_XLOBDo_Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Michael Jackson: Billie Jean \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In LA\u2019s Westlake Recording Studios during 1982, Billie Jean became something unprecedented. Jackson once admitted to Daryl Hall that he\u2019d lifted the bassline from Hall &amp; Oates\u2019 recent hit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccenFp_3kq8\">I Can\u2019t Go for That (No Can Do)</a>, and you can hear the resemblance in the demo, but Hall &amp; Oates\u2019 groove is sly and playful while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/24/louis-johnson\">Louis Johnson</a>\u2019s bassline, augmented by growls of distorted synth bass, is a panther. Tasked by Jones with creating a \u201cunique sonic personality\u201d, engineer Bruce Swedien completely rebuilt Ndugu Chancler\u2019s drum kit to produce that unmistakably dry, deadened sound. The rest of the arrangement suggests mounting agitation, from arranger Jerry Lubbock\u2019s spiralling film noir violins to David Williams\u2019s feverish guitar solo. Jackson and Jones pushed Swedien to produce 91 different mixes, only to choose the second one, which is a classic case study on the respective merits of perspiration and inspiration.</p> <p>The result was revolutionary. No 1 for just one week in the UK but seven in the US, Billie Jean helped to make Thriller the biggest-selling album of all time. By boosting record sales across the board, it jolted the music industry out of its post-disco slump. It was during a performance of Billie Jean in the Motown 25 TV special that Jackson debuted the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmt_es3r-YM\">moonwalk</a>, and it was the Billie Jean video that introduced black music to the fledgling MTV. \u201cMichael Jackson was the reason MTV went from big to huge,\u201d attested co-founder John Sykes. \u201cHe put us at the centre of the culture.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/18/was-surprised-how-unceasing-the-abuse-was-fallout-leaving-neverland-michael-jackson-dan-reed\">\u2018I was surprised how unceasing the abuse was\u2019: the fallout from Leaving Neverland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For all its fame, there is something eternally unresolved about Billie Jean: an unstable account by an unreliable witness. Is the narrator a maligned innocent (tested, like Jesus, for 40 days and 40 nights) or a guilty man who can\u2019t get his story straight? He insists, \u201cBillie Jean is not my lover\u201d, but admits, \u201cThis happened much too soon / She called me to her room.\u201d He says, \u201cThe kid is not my son\u201d, only to let slip, \u201cHis eyes were like mine\u201d. He is by turns indignant and full of shame; he knows he did <em>something</em> wrong. As his mother always told him: \u201cBe careful what you do \u2019cause the lie becomes the truth.\u201d And listen to how he tells this story. Jackson\u2019s arsenal of yelps, screams, squeaks, gasps, giggles and grunts would soon become shtick, and ultimately self-parody, but here he sounds as if he is sweating and fidgeting under pressure, like he doesn\u2019t really expect to be believed.</p> <p>I\u2019m talking about the song\u2019s narrator here but of course subsequent events have made this strange record stranger still. The Michael Jackson song that we just can\u2019t quit is a case of alleged sexual misconduct that is left to the listener to adjudicate. Everyone is watching but what are they seeing?</p>",

Interweaving a 19th-century British seafaring expedition in search of the garden of Eden with a vicious episode in Australian colonial history, it dramatised the clash between faith and science, empathy and self-interest.</p> <p>Two decades on, his new novel tracks another journey: that of a motley group of 13th-century pilgrims, banding together for safety on the road from England towards Rome. A landowner has been ordered to make the trip after fighting over territory with a local abbot, but most are following the prickings of their own conscience or wanderlust, as well as hoping to win reduced time in purgatory. Constance fears her adultery has brought down sickness on her young son; her freeloading sister is along for the ride. Oswald has made a career of performing pilgrimages for the souls of the dead. Margaret wants more souvenir pilgrim badges for her hat. And Tom son of Tom, a poor village lad, hopes \u201cgood Saint Pete\u201d will intercede with God on behalf of his dead cat, which has been appearing in his dreams with purgatorial fires licking at its fur. His family are happy enough to see him go; there\u2019ll be more room in the shared bed.</p> <p>There\u2019s a sly, humane comedy in the way Kneale ventriloquises both the stranglehold of religious law on daily life and thought and the endlessly inventive individual efforts to exploit and interpret it. Warin, a tailor seething with class resentment against \u201cfalse priests and rich leeches\u201d, is escorting his daughter Beatrix, who has dodged her chore of cleaning out the chickens by becoming \u201cGod\u2019s mouthpiece\u201d, producing divine commandments in a croaky voice. She has a message for the Pope: \u201cThe fiend walks among you in Margate.\u201d Two pilgrim portraits are based on historical figures: Matilda Froome, an enterprising religious hysteric for whom a romance with Jesus is preferable to domestic drudgery, and Lucy de Bourne, a very merry widow seeking a divorce on the grounds of consanguinity (\u201call the gentle folk of Lincolnshire were cousins \u2026 it only counted when you wanted to divorce one\u201d). Lucy\u2019s sin first, pray later attitude is enabled by a pet priest to whom she can confess privately rather than having to do it out loud in church, and her gossipy tour of the intricacies of medieval marriage law is fascinating.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When they finally make it to Rome, Constance remarks that St Peter\u2019s is 'very fine, but Norwich is longer, don\u2019t you think?'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Linguistically, Kneale treads lightly, with a chatty, modernised version of medieval English that slips down easily (inevitably, as he says in the afterword, a \u201ccompromise\u201d). In his sections, Tom is a convincing and vigorous guide to his fellow pilgrims \u2013 showing us \u201ca little stick of a fellow and a big marrow of a thing ... A break-chest of a fellow, a tall leek of a boy\u201d \u2013 but there is little variation in the other six voices. This stands in stark contrast to the linguistic invention unleashed in <em>English Passengers</em>, or indeed in James Meek\u2019s recent pilgrimage tale, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/12/to-calais-in-ordinary-time-by-james-meek-review\">To Calais, in Ordinary Time</a></em>, which parsed the medieval world through three different registers: peasant, clerk and noblewoman.</p> <p>Kneale\u2019s aim is immediacy and recognition, and he brings the characters as close as possible with much millennium-spanning humour. There\u2019s a running joke about the disappointments of travel; when they finally make it to Rome, Constance remarks that St Peter\u2019s is \u201cvery fine, but Norwich is longer, don\u2019t you think?\u201d (Kneale\u2019s previous book was a history of Rome, and here he shows us the hectic medieval city, loomed over by ruins \u201clike the bones of a huge dead beast\u201d.) The characters all share a down-to-earth, proto-<em>Canterbury Tales</em> worldview; the religious ecstasies of Matilda the mystic are entirely played for laughs, and some episodes, particularly a night in a nunnery (\u201cIt\u2019s only a bit of kissing\u201d), veer into the realm of the romp.</p> <p>But by the book\u2019s ending, the broad comedy and easy cohesion of the central characters \u2013 a Merrie England in miniature \u2013 are revealed as artful choices. Their pilgrimage is bookended by persecution, a structural counterpoint that casts the main narrative in shadow and exposes the seam of prejudice running through our national story. The first chapter, set 25 years earlier in 1264, is narrated by a Jewish woman amid \u201cthe new troubles\u201d of the second barons\u2019 war, when anti-Jewish sentiment was weaponised into massacres. In Tom\u2019s final chapter, the pilgrimage is over; virtue has been rewarded and malice punished, and the narrative loose ends tied up with jaunty bows. And then we glimpse, just in passing, the beginning of Edward I\u2019s expulsion of Jews from England \u2013 a sad procession along a country lane. Earlier in the novel, a central episode had suggested that shared experience can vanquish fear of the other: \u201cWhat does it matter what religion they have when their souls are kindly?\u201d These pilgrims are, mostly, kindly, and Kneale makes them excellent company. But they still spit, or smirk, or stay silent when the carts of Jews go by.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Pilgrims by Matthew Kneale is published by Atlantic (RRP \u00a316.99).</em></p>",
  "<p>A film about a series of hilariously grotesque murders on a B-movie film set certainly isn\u2019t going to be to everyone\u2019s taste.

The independent studio\u2019s main flirtation with the mainstream came via the Toxic Avenger series, as gory and gross as anything else it produced, but somehow deemed suitable for a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_Crusaders\">children\u2019s TV spin-off</a> in the 90s when everything from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammerman\">MC Hammer\u2019s magic shoes</a> to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_California_Raisins\">the California Raisins</a> were worthy of animated immortality. To be clear: Troma is definitely not suitable for kids.</p> <p>I first came across Terror Firmer by accident on TV late one night, as a too-young-for-this teenager. A more perfect way to stumble upon the works of director (and studio co-founder) Lloyd Kaufman I could not imagine. In many ways it is the ur-Troma, a distillation and compilation of everything great (and not so great) about its brand of movie-making.</p> <p>Set during the filming of a low-budget exploitation movie in New York being directed by an insane blind director (played by Kaufman), it was loosely based on the book <em>A</em>ll I Need to Know about Filmmaking I Learned from&nbsp;The Toxic Avenger which was co-written by Kaufman and James Gunn, just a few years before he wrote Scooby Doo. It\u2019s no wonder that Gunn\u2019s sense of humour nearly cost him his place in the big time, when old tweets saw him <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-47577507\">fired (then rehired) by Disney</a>.</p> <p>The Troma film within a Troma film gives plenty of opportunities for in-jokes \u2013 and no chance is passed up. The succession of nodding winks to the company\u2019s past will mostly be lost on Troma virgins (Toxie pops up, as does the Penis Monster from Tromeo and Juliet), but the gags pour forth at such a rate that there\u2019s bound to be something in there to tickle you.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xznZUpriU_Y\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xznZUpriU_Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>If nothing else, this will show you what these films are all about. The kills performed by the homicidal \u201chermaphrodite\u201d (more on this later \u2026) are so over the top, so creative, and often so disgusting that it can be hard to turn away. The sight of Troma mainstay Joe Fleishaker being <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=10155165453573868\">consumed by an escalator</a> has long stuck in my mind (always do up your shoelaces before getting on a subway, children).</p> <p>The plot, for what it is, centres around the on-set love triangle between production assistant Jennifer, boom-operator Casey and special effects man Jerry \u2013 all as various characters are being bumped off by an apparently female serial killer. Anyone who\u2019s seen the cover image will know that there\u2019s more to Casey than meets the eye, and it is the apparently dull, but actually sexually conflicted and intersex Casey, as played by Will Keenan, that is revealed as the homicidal maniac terrorising the film within a film\u2019s production.</p> <p>While Keenan\u2019s performance is appropriately over-the-top and deranged, the disgust at a character with two sets of genitals hasn\u2019t aged well. While in the 90s even mainstream hits like Ace Ventura were happy to poke fun at trans or intersex characters (even if <a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/jim-carrey-re-evaluates-transphobic-ace-ventura-jokes.html/\">Jim Carrey might claim</a> the joke was supposed to be on the bigotry of the titular detective), that sort of humour doesn\u2019t sit well these days \u2013 if it ever did. There\u2019s a similar level of disgust displayed by characters in Terror Firmer when Casey\u2019s secret is both figuratively and literally exposed \u2013 so are we supposed to laugh at the over the top reaction (\u201clook at how stupid their disgust is\u201d) or join in laughing at what\u2019s in the underwear of the intersex murderer? Is this a parody of the <a href=\"https://morbidlybeautiful.com/transphobia-horror-1/\">trans-killer trope which is all too-prevalent in horror</a> or just another example of it? That\u2019s not clear.</p> <p>This scattergun approach to comedy, where everything is free to be poked fun at, will be familiar to anyone who\u2019s seen the work of South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. No surprise then that they are also Troma alums. The unease is all part and parcel of the Troma experience, it\u2019s offensive and it\u2019s supposed to be \u2013 if there\u2019s a line to be crossed, then it will be joyfully skipped over. As Jerry tells Casey during the film: \u201cYou can do whatever you want to at Troma \u2026 It\u2019s this shit in which the best chaos emerges. Sometimes pissing people off is the only reason to get them to look at shit.\u201d</p> <p>Whether or not you have the stomach for it will determine how much enjoyment you get out of these films.

  "<p>Will the Tories get away with it? In many ways, it\u2019s been the central question in our politics since they squeaked back into government in 2010.

They have maintained that ascendancy, in large part, by ignoring the usual rules of political accountability. They\u2019ve succeeded by being shameless.</p> <p>Conventionally, British governments are thought to be answerable to a shifting but powerful combination of institutions and interest groups: parliament, the main political parties, the courts, the media, business, Whitehall\u2019s codes and conventions, and public opinion. All governments try to ignore some of these, some of the time. Government is difficult, especially in an old, quarrelsome country such as Britain, and being held to account for your inevitable mistakes can be lethal.</p> <p>But few British governments have worked as hard to avoid accountability as the Tories since 2010. From the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/18/what-is-the-fixed-term-parliaments-act\">Fixed-term Parliaments Act of 2011</a>, which prevented David Cameron\u2019s controversial coalition from being judged in an early election, to Theresa May\u2019s attempts to stop MPs debating her Brexit deal, to Boris Johnson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/24/boris-johnsons-suspension-of-parliament-unlawful-supreme-court-rules-prorogue\">illegal suspension</a> of parliament last year, the Conservatives have hidden from scrutiny ever more blatantly. Even the language Johnson uses \u2013 on the rare occasions he appears in public \u2013 seems designed to minimise accountability, with its clouds of vague adjectival phrases (\u201cvast progress\u201d, \u201cworld-beating\u201d) and as few verifiable facts as possible.&nbsp;</p> <p>This week, this contempt for accountability reached its logical conclusion, in a way, with Johnson\u2019s refusal to sack the unelected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/dominic-cummings\">Dominic Cummings</a> for clearly breaking their own government\u2019s lockdown rules, or even to respond to many of the allegations against him. For anyone brought up on the idea that British politicians are scared of the press, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-refuses-to-resign-or-apologise-for-lockdown-breach\">Cummings\u2019 performance</a> in the Downing Street garden on Monday was quite an education. When a reporter from the Daily Mail \u2013 usually believed to be the most influential paper of all \u2013 asked Cummings whether he had offered to resign, he didn\u2019t even look up from the written statement he had just given. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lisaocarroll/status/1264951415606296577\">\u201cNo. I have not offered to resign,\u201d</a> he said flatly, continuing to scribble on his papers. \u201cI have not considered it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One obvious advantage of answering only to \u201cthe people\u201d is that \u2013 in theory, at least \u2013 it need happen only occasionally</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For Cummings and Johnson, like other populists, the only authority to whom politicians should be accountable is the usefully nebulous one of \u201cthe people\u201d. Defending Cummings\u2019 behaviour during lockdown, Johnson and his ministers have been saying all week: \u201cPeople will make up their own minds.\u201d Repeating stock answers, regardless of the question asked, is another way of avoiding accountability, and is the government\u2019s main communications strategy.</p> <p>One obvious advantage of answering only to \u201cthe people\u201d is that \u2013 in theory, at least \u2013 it need happen only occasionally, in general elections. And between such contests, a government with a strong majority, such as the current one, can do a great deal in a single term in centralised Britain, as radical prime ministers from Clement Attlee to Margaret Thatcher have demonstrated.</p> <p>Arguably, it was Thatcher\u2019s fall in 1990, and the 20 years of often anxious, closely scrutinised governments that followed, that established the model of accountability from which Johnson and Cummings are trying to escape. Thatcher was dumped as Tory leader and premier despite having handsomely won her third election in a row only three years earlier, largely because of an unproven suspicion in parts of her party and the media that she was no longer a winner. She was held to account by the Westminster establishment, and found wanting.</p> <p>Her successor, John Major, led a government that effectively imploded under the weight of hostile scrutiny. Scandals far smaller than the Cummings one led to a stream of ministerial resignations. Newspaper editors felt, sometimes correctly, that they could push the prime minister around. The then editor of the News of the World, Piers Morgan, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Insider:_The_Private_Diaries_of_a_Scandalous_Decade\">wrote in his diary</a>: \u201cMajor\u2019s brought all these exposes on himself, with that ludicrous \u2018Back to Basics\u2019 speech\u201d, which had called for a return to \u201ctraditional values.\u201d Half in jest, Morgan worried that if his paper kept exposing Tory \u201csexual shenanigans\u201d, \u201cthere will be literally nobody left to run the country\u201d. If only exposing Tory hypocrisy had a similar effect now.</p> <p>After Major came Tony Blair, with his crushing majorities. But even he governed as if he was perpetually on trial before the tabloids, big business, swing voters and other rightwing or centrist interest groups. New Labour was often too worried about being accountable to be radical.</p> <p>Since 2010, the Tories certainly haven\u2019t made that mistake. They\u2019ve reshaped the country and its relations with the outside world almost regardless of what anyone else thinks. And when they\u2019ve been too weak or short of ideas to enact many policies \u2013 as they were from the 2017 election to the Brexit stalemate last autumn \u2013 they\u2019ve just clung on, ignoring regular Commons humiliations and the declarations of commentators that they lacked the authority to govern.</p> <p>The stubborn, tunnel-vision quality of modern Conservative government can be disorientating for Westminster journalists, many of whom absorbed a lot of their assumptions about how politics works during the 90s and 00s. Towards the end of Cummings\u2019 long, repetitive press conference, a reporter asked almost desperately: \u201cHow can you not feel apologetic?\u201d</p> <p>Yet even the very limited accountability that populists do accept can be dangerous for governments in between elections, in some circumstances, such as during a national emergency. The polls show that a growing majority of people are outraged by Cummings\u2019 lockdown breaches \u2013 and this anger is fast eating into the government\u2019s popularity.</p> <p>Many voters may have been vaguely aware for years that a seam of hypocrisy has run through the Conservative governments since 2010, which behind their rhetoric of national sacrifice has indulged the rich and powerful. But the Cummings affair has brought this hypocrisy to the surface of public life, and crystallised it into a compelling, easily digestible anecdote.</p> <p>As Major discovered when his administration was characterised as \u201csleazy\u201d, once warning labels are attached to a government they are almost impossible to peel off. Whether Cummings eventually resigns, or is sacked, or not, what many voters think about the government may this week have shifted for good. Reporters will be looking for more hypocrites in Johnson\u2019s administration. It may become a zombie government: stumbling on in office for years more, as Major did after his scandals, but widely discredited and mocked.</p> <p>However hard populists try to limit it, political accountability comes in many forms. Having to govern before a contemptuous public can be the most painful of all.</p> <p>\u2022 Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Shortly after becoming prime minister Abiy also confessed that security officials had in the past committed torture, and <a href=\"https://www.africanews.com/2018/04/15/ethiopia-pm-pledges-to-reform-security-sector-and-revisit-repressive-laws//\">promised</a> to ensure the sector was fully accountable in the future.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the OLA has since returned to armed conflict, and accuses the government of failing to deliver its promises of more democracy and self-rule for Oromos.&nbsp;</p> <p>Fighting in western and southern parts of Oromia has involved targeted killings of local officials and community leaders and what the UN has described&nbsp;as <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/ethiopia-access-snapshot-guji-zone-oromia-region-28-february-2020\">\u201cserious human rights violations</a>\u201d.

It also said that on a single day in December 2018, soldiers from the federal military killed 13 people in the town of Finchawa in West Guji. One of those killed was an old woman selling milk on the street, according to an eyewitness who spoke to Amnesty.</p> <p>Security forces are estimated to have detained more than 10,000 men and women suspected of supporting or working for the OLA, among other abuses documented by the organisation.</p> <p>Many were detained for several months without being charged, in violation of both national and international human rights laws, under conditions which at times amounted to torture, the report found. Detainees were made to undergo two months of \u201ctraining\u201d in subjects such as constitutionalism, the rule of law and the history of the Oromo people\u2019s struggle.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Amhara, according to the report, regional police, militia and local vigilante groups engaged in targeted attacks on ethnic Qemant, a minority group demanding more autonomy, in inter-communal violence which resulted in at least 130 deaths last year. In January 2019, at least 58 people were reportedly killed in less than 24 hours and buried in mass graves.&nbsp;</p> <p>Nobody has yet been held accountable for the atrocity.</p> <p>Amnesty said it had sought responses to its findings from nine government offices including the defence ministry and the attorney-general\u2019s office but had only received a response from Amhara\u2019s regional security bureau, which denied that state security forces had been involved in any atrocities.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/15/suspicion-and-fear-linger-as-ethiopia-campus-wars-go-quiet\">Suspicion and fear linger as Ethiopia\u2019s campus wars go quiet</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The rights group called on the government to carry out full investigations into human rights violations and to order security forces to stop carrying out unlawful executions, arbitrary arrests and detention, as well as forced evictions and destruction of property belonging to people suspected of supporting opposition political parties or armed groups.</p> <p>In February last year the former head of the Ethiopian army <a href=\"https://allafrica.com/stories/201902140326.html\">said</a> it had embarked on \u201cdeep institutional reform\u201d as part of the democratic changes sweeping the nation.</p> <p>The head of the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission, Daniel Bekele, told the Guardian: \u201cWhile the Amnesty findings and ongoing reports of killings and arrests in parts of Oromia region should be taken seriously and fully investigated, it is also important to understand the complex nature of the security operations where armed groups are seriously destabilising the affected areas.\u201d</p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s office said it would put the Guardian\u2019s request for official comment to the peace ministry, which did not respond in time for publication.</p>",

It warned that the coronavirus pandemic had pushed the UK to a \u201cpoverty tipping point\u201d.</p> <p>The woman, who lived on the top floor of a tenement block, was given hot soup and a food parcel after being discovered on 23 March by a mobile food support project of the Salvation Army, which is a Christian church and charity, and by Govan housing association.</p> <p>Tracy Bearcroft, a major in the <a href=\"https://www.salvationarmy.org.uk/govan\">Govan Salvation Army</a>, told the Guardian: \u201cShe had no one to get anything for her and she was too frightened to go out.

  "<p>Large heath butterflies are returning to peatlands in greater Manchester 150 years after they went locally extinct.</p> <p>The acidic peat bogs and mosslands around Manchester and Liverpool were home to the country\u2019s biggest colonies of large heath butterflies \u2013 known as the \u201cManchester argus\u201d \u2013 but numbers plummeted as land was drained for agricultural land and peat extraction.&nbsp;</p> <p>Conservationists from Lancashire Wildlife Trust are now looking to reverse the fortunes of this rare butterfly by restoring a 37-hectare area of peatland between Wigan and Salford where they have recreated habitats of sphagnum moss, cross-leaved heath and hare\u2019s-tail cottongrass on which the butterflies depend.&nbsp;</p> <p>Last summer, staff collected six female butterflies from a population at Winmarleigh moss near Garstang and took them to Chester zoo.

This reintroduction part of a wider effort to get native wildlife back in the right areas \u2026 It just seemed right that if we could get Manchester\u2019s butterfly back to the mosses that\u2019s something we should do. Everyone here is absolutely over the moon about this.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Peat extraction means these boggy areas are up to 20 feet lower than they were a century ago and this reintroduction is part of a bigger project to restore greater Manchester\u2019s heavily degraded wetlands. Other species set to be reintroduced include bog bush cricket, white-faced darter dragonfly and carnivorous sundew.&nbsp;</p> <p>The 2019 State of Nature report found 41% of UK butterfly species had declined with one in 10 at risk of extinction. Jo Kennedy, a project coordinator at Lancashire Wildlife Trust, said: \u201cAcross our region we have lost 98% of our lowland raised bogs, creating a huge hole in our biodiversity. To function as a healthy ecosystem, we need a tapestry of different and connected habitats each supporting a variety of plants and animals.\u201d</p> <p>There are a few isolated populations of large heath butterflies remaining in England and Wales and larger populations in Scotland.&nbsp;</p> <p>This follows the successful reintroduction of large heath butterflies to Heysham Moss in Lancashire between 2014 and 2016, and conservationists are now planning to reintroduce the butterflies to Risley Moss in Cheshire.</p>",
  "<p>When Woody Allen was 20, the writer Danny Simon taught him a few rules about comedy, the most important of which was this: always trust your own judgment, because external opinion is meaningless.</p> <p>Allen recounts this tale in his recently published memoir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/09/apropos-of-nothing-by-woody-allen-review-a-life-and-an-accusation\">Apropos of Nothing</a>. That this book exists at all is proof that he still adheres to that rule. These days, Allen\u2019s name is mud, a fact made clear by the critics, who wrote their reviews with one hand while holding their noses with the other. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/books/review-apropos-of-nothing-memoir-woody-allen.html\">The New York Times\u2019 critic wrote</a>: \u201cVolunteering to review [this book], in our moral climate, is akin to volunteering for the 2021 Olympic javelin-catching team.\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markharrisnyc/status/1252962663044468736?lang=en\">Another publication\u2019s headline</a> was: \u201cI Read Woody Allen\u2019s Memoir So You Don\u2019t Have To.\u201d </p> <p>There are a thousand things one could discuss with Allen: his 70 years in comedy, his 55 years of making movies. But, at this point, there is really only one thing to discuss \u2013 and he knows it. \u201cYou can ask me anything,\u201d he tells me down the phone from his home in (of course) Manhattan. So, even though our interview is supposed to be about his latest film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/13/woody-allen-rainy-day-in-new-york-tops-global-box-office\">A Rainy Day in New York</a>, we spend the hour talking about the scandal that has overshadowed his career for the past 25 years and, for many, obscured it. \u201cI assume that for the rest of my life a large number of people will think I was a predator,\u201d he says in his still distinctive Brooklyn accent (\u201cpred-ah-tah\u201d).</p> <p>He also knows there is nothing he can do about it: \u201cAnything I say sounds self-serving and defensive, so it\u2019s best if I just go my way and work,\u201d he says. He is 84 and Rainy Day is his 48th film. He has already finished his 49th and, if it were not for the coronavirus, he would be making his 50th this summer.</p> <p>The broad outlines of the scandal are now better known than most of his films. In 1992, it emerged that, aged 57, he was having an affair with Soon-Yi Previn, then 21, the adopted daughter of his long-term partner, Mia Farrow. During the inevitably acrimonious breakup, Farrow accused him of sexually assaulting their seven-year-old adopted daughter, Dylan.

At this point, Farrow also had six older children of her own, including Soon-Yi.)

But, in the past decade, since <a href=\"https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/an-open-letter-from-dylan-farrow/\">Dylan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/03/ronan-farrow-hachette-woody-allen-memoir\">Ronan</a> have spoken out publicly against their father, and <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2018/09/soon-yi-previn-speaks.html\">Soon-Yi</a> and <a href=\"http://mosesfarrow.blogspot.com/2018/05/a-son-speaks-out-by-moses-farrow.html\">Moses</a> have defended him, attention has focused on the molestation charge. In 2014, <a href=\"https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/an-open-letter-from-dylan-farrow/\">Dylan wrote in the New York Times</a>: \u201cWoody Allen is a living testament to the way society fails the survivors of sexual abuse and assault.\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/my-father-woody-allen-danger-892572\">In a 2016 article in </a><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/my-father-woody-allen-danger-892572\">the Hollywood Reporter</a>, Ronan castigated the media for giving a free pass to Allen, just because he had never been convicted: \u201cIt is not an excuse for the press to silence victims, to never interrogate allegations.\u201d (He did not reply to a request for comment.)</p> <p>There is a much greater awareness today of the prevalence of sexual abuse than there was in 1992 and the public is increasingly fearful of being on the wrong side of history; to question any woman\u2019s story is, in the eyes of many, to be a rape apologist.</p> <p>So the old allegation against Allen has been accorded more power than it ever had, especially among a generation that was barely born in the 90s. He is now routinely named \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/16/opinion/sunday/michael-jackson-leaving-neverland.html\">by journalists</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/my-father-woody-allen-danger-892572\">the Farrows</a> and the public \u2013 alongside Harvey Weinstein and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/13/woody-allen-polanski-cosby-dangerous-cannes-ronan-farrow\">Bill Cosby</a>, both of whom are convicted of multiple offences, their crimes going back decades. I covered the Weinstein and Cosby cases, as well as many other stories about high-profile men either convicted or accused of sexual offences: Michael Jackson, R Kelly, Jimmy Savile, Jeffrey Epstein, Larry Nassar. All of them were accused of attacking multiple victims; their pattern of predatory behaviour spanned their lifetime.&nbsp;Allen was accused of one instance of molestation and not only was he not convicted, but he was never even charged; photos of him in court with Farrow are from their custody battle over their children, not from a criminal trial.<strong> </strong>Why doesn\u2019t he sue when the New York Times calls him a \u201cmonster\u201d alongside Epstein and Weinstein?</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t pay to sue. Do I really want to be tabloid fodder for two years and go to court? And do I really care?\u201d he says. Given that he lays out the allegation and ensuing drama in searing detail in his memoir, I would wager he cares quite a lot these days.</p> <p>The book is one heck of a read.<strong> </strong>With its funny remembrances of his past jostling up against his palpably furious recollections of the fallout from his breakup with Farrow, it is like watching a double bill of Radio Days and Kramer vs Kramer. He insists the allegation is just \u201ca small part of the story\u201d, but it cuts across it like an angry wound: when he describes the events of 1992, you can feel his shock; when he describes the allegation\u2019s recent resurgence, his frustration burns off the page. He writes about \u201cwell-meaning citizens, brimming with moral indignation, only too happy to nobly take a stand on an issue they had absolutely no knowledge of\u201d while other outsiders \u201crushed to outdo one another in profiles of courage. By God, they were against child molestation and were not afraid to say it.\u201d </p> <p>In March, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/03/ronan-farrow-hachette-woody-allen-memoir\">Ronan objected to Hachette</a> \u2013 which published his book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/20/catch-and-kill-ronan-farrow-review\">Catch and Kill</a> \u2013 publishing Allen\u2019s memoir, Hachette caved in. Actors who worked with Allen after the original scandal but before the change in public mood \u2013 including Mira Sorvino, Greta Gerwig, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/18/colin-firth-woody-allen-accusations-film\">Colin Firth</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/12/rebecca-hall-woody-allen-dylan-farrow\">Rebecca Hall</a> \u2013 expressed their deepest remorse. Those who refuse to do so \u2013 such as Larry David, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/30/diane-keaton-woody-allen-dylan-farrow\">Diane Keaton</a>, Alec Baldwin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/14/alan-alda-its-amazing-that-most-of-us-live-as-if-were-not-gonna-die\">Alan Alda</a> and Scarlett Johansson \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/the-most-ridiculous-reasons-celebrities-have-had-for-actually-defending-woody-allen.html/\">are publicly shamed</a>.

The actors have no idea of the facts and they latch on to some self-serving, public, safe position. Who in the world is not against child molestation?\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s how actors and actresses are, and [denouncing me] became the fashionable thing to do, like everybody suddenly eating kale.\u201d External opinion is meaningless.</p> <p>That said, Allen makes sure to include in his book an amusingly pointed story about Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, who stars in Rainy Day: \u201cTimoth\u00e9e afterward publicly stated he regretted working with me and was giving the money to charity. But he swore to my sister he needed to do that as he was up for an Oscar for Call Me By Your Name, and he and his agent felt he had a better chance of winning if he denounced me, so he did.\u201d (Chalamet\u2019s people did not return requests for a comment.)</p> <p>\u201cYou can give people the testimony by those who worked in the house,\u201d Allen says, referring to the Farrow children\u2019s nanny, Monica Thompson, who gave<a href=\"https://www.upi.com/Archives/1993/02/01/Nanny-Mia-wanted-me-to-back-her-story/8228728542800/\">&nbsp;two sworn affidavits</a>&nbsp;saying Mia had tried to coax her into backing the molestation charge, then said Allen \u201cwas always the better parent and all the things Farrow is saying about him are not true\u201d.</p> <p>Allen continues: \u201cYou can give them the facts over and over. But the facts don\u2019t matter. For some reason, emotionally, it\u2019s important for them to buy into the story.\u201d</p> <p>These are the facts: after Farrow alleged that Allen \u2013 never accused of any impropriety before or since \u2013 molested Dylan in her house in Connecticut, doctors examined her and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/26/nyregion/farrow-testifies-that-daughter-accused-allen-of-molestation.html\">found no physical evidence of abuse</a>. Allen was then investigated by the Yale New Haven hospital\u2019s sexual abuse clinic and New York City\u2019s Child Welfare Administration. The former concluded: \u201cIt is our expert opinion that Dylan was not sexually molested by Mr Allen.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/26/nyregion/agency-drops-abuse-inquiry-in-allen-case.html\">The latter, after a 14-month</a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/26/nyregion/agency-drops-abuse-inquiry-in-allen-case.html\"> investigation, wrote</a>: \u201cNo credible evidence was found that the child named in this report has been abused or maltreated.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I assume that for the rest of my life a large number of people will think I was a predator</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Dr John Leventhal, who headed the Yale New Haven report, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/04/nyregion/doctor-cites-inconsistencies-in-dylan-farrow-s-statements.html\">testified that Dylan</a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/04/nyregion/doctor-cites-inconsistencies-in-dylan-farrow-s-statements.html\">\u2019s statements had \u201ca rehearsed quality\u201d</a> and hypothesised that \u201cshe was coached or influenced by her mother\u201d. The judge in the custody trial, Justice Elliott Wilk, dismissed this, <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/heres-the-1993-woody-alle_b_4746866\">saying in his court ruling</a> that \u201cthere is no credible evidence to support Mr Allen\u2019s contention that Ms Farrow coached Dylan\u201d, while, in a 2018 TV interview, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/18/dylan-farrow-denies-being-brainwashed-in-cbs-tv-interview-woody-allen-allegations\">Dylan </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/18/dylan-farrow-denies-being-brainwashed-in-cbs-tv-interview-woody-allen-allegations\">firmly denied it</a>, saying: \u201cMy mother has only encouraged me to tell the truth.\u201d</p> <p>But Leventhal\u2019s theory was corroborated by Moses, also in 2018, <a href=\"http://mosesfarrow.blogspot.com/2018/05/a-son-speaks-out-by-moses-farrow.html\">when he wrote </a><a href=\"http://mosesfarrow.blogspot.com/2018/05/a-son-speaks-out-by-moses-farrow.html\">that </a><a href=\"http://mosesfarrow.blogspot.com/2018/05/a-son-speaks-out-by-moses-farrow.html\">Farrow \u201cbrainwashed\u201d the children</a>, adding: \u201cI was forced to follow my mother\u2019s script to prove my loyalty.\u201d</p> <p>Some, including sources close to the Farrows, have <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2013/11/mia-farrow-frank-sinatra-ronan-farrow]\">alleged that Leventhal never actually interviewed Dylan</a> and suggested that Yale New Haven\u2019s panel \u2013 which had handled <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-05-05-mn-31539-story.html\">more than 1,700 cases by 1992</a> \u2013 and their findings should not be relied on. But, <a href=\"https://slate.com/human-interest/2014/02/woody-allen-and-dylan-farrow-digging-deeper-into-misleading-coverage.html\">according to reports</a>, Dylan was interviewed nine times over six months by two social workers, Jennifer Sawyer and Julia Hamilton, who were part of the team. It is possible they were given this delicate job at least partly because they, unlike Leventhal, were female and Dylan was a seven-year-old girl. For discretionary reasons, Leventhal could not comment on the case. </p> <p>Many will argue that, as a wealthy white man, Allen was protected by authorities (although Allen writes in his memoir that one doctor involved in the case believed the Connecticut police were antisemitic). But assuming guilt in a person who was never charged is a morally precarious position \u2013 and to do so about a case that has long been mired in misinformation and misunderstanding bulldozes through any concept of due process.</p> <p>It is almost 30 years since Allen was first accused of molestation; by this point, almost everything people think they know about the case is wrong. One popular belief is that Allen had been in therapy for \u201cinappropriate\u201d feelings towards Dylan since she was a baby and it has been <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2014/02/woody-allen-sex-abuse-10-facts\">strongly implied that these feelings were sexual</a>. \u201cThat\u2019s a complete and total fabrication, like a space craft landing in New York,\u201d says Allen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91e0aeb933518caa711bdb365ab5b58530b70523\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91e0aeb933518caa711bdb365ab5b58530b70523/0_0_1600_1067/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woody Allen on the Rainy Day set with Selena Gomez\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Allen on the set of Rainy Day with Selena Gomez.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Miglio</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/205403621/Allen-v-Farrow-Custody-Ruling-June-7-1993\">Transcripts from the custody trial</a> back him up. Dr Susan Coates, a child psychologist who treated Satchel and evaluated Dylan, described Allen and Dylan\u2019s relationship as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/02/nyregion/psychologist-testifies-about-visitation-rights-for-allen.html\">\u201cinappropriately intense\u201d</a>, but <a href=\"https://www.upi.com/Archives/1993/03/30/Psychiatrist-Woody-was-committed-to-being-a-good-father/1405733467600/\">denied it was in any way \u201cromantic\u201d</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI did not see it as sexual, but I saw it as inappropriately intense because it excluded everybody else,\u201d Coates said. In other words, Allen was not emotionally involved with Farrow\u2019s older children, but instead focused on Dylan, who was the first child he had raised since she was a baby, because Farrow adopted her during their relationship. Dylan\u2019s therapist, Dr Nancy Schultz, also <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-the-shocking-custody-case-court-documents-that-shed-light-on-the-dylan-farrow-woody-allen-saga\">said she believed that Allen did not sexually abuse Dylan</a>, while Allen\u2019s therapist of 21 years, Dr Kathryn Prescott, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5u0qAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT176&amp;lpg=PT176&amp;dq=kathryn+prescott+woody+allen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qOgojnIjwx&amp;sig=ACfU3U286_jzdS73F71KOErhe6Hry2R3IA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi-kPv278bpAhVMRBUIHUygAN8Q6AEwEnoECBMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=kathryn%20prescott%20woody%20allen&amp;f=false\">testified</a>: \u201cThere has never been any suggestion that Mr Allen was suffering from a sexual perversion/deviant sexual behaviour.\u201d</p> <p>The only person who described Allen\u2019s behaviour towards Dylan as \u201csexual\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/26/nyregion/farrow-testifies-that-daughter-accused-allen-of-molestation.html\">was </a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/26/nyregion/farrow-testifies-that-daughter-accused-allen-of-molestation.html\">Farrow</a>, although even she said <a href=\"https://www.upi.com/Archives/1993/03/25/Mia-I-worried-about-Woody-being-a-homosexual/8544733035600/\">in the custody hearing</a>: \u201cSexual is not the name I used at the time \u2026 It was relentless and overpowering.\u201d Yet just a few months before the scandal broke, <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/society/woody-and-mia-modern-family-timeline/\">she endorsed Allen\u2019s bid to co-adopt Dylan</a>.</p> <p>The other argument often cited against Allen is that the state prosecutor Frank Maco stated he had \u201cprobable cause\u201d to charge Allen for child molestation, but would not do so because it would be too traumatic for Dylan. Less well remembered is <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/suffer-children-191082\">Maco\u2019s other public comment on the case</a>: \u201cTo risk the wellbeing of a child where there is evidence which points to the existence of a reasonable doubt is nothing less than to sacrifice the child on an altar of public spectacle,\u201d he said.</p> <p>I called Maco this week to ask what he meant: \u201cI would have had to put the child on the stand and the child would have had to relate what happened, and that child could not do that in any setting \u2013 an open court, a closed court \u2013 at that point. She just couldn\u2019t,\u201d he told me. Yet \u201cprobable cause\u201d has stuck to Allen in a way \u201creasonable doubt\u201d has not.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m angry at what\u2019s been done to Dylan and Ronan ... they\u2019ve been raised to think the worst of me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Many cite Wilk\u2019s custody ruling as proof that Allen did something wrong, even though it was not a criminal trial. There is no question <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/heres-the-1993-woody-alle_b_4746866\">the ruling is extremely personally damning about Allen</a> (\u201cWilk hated me from the moment he set eyes on me,\u201d Allen writes in his memoir). But Wilk\u2019s main criticism was not Allen\u2019s relationship with Dylan<strong> </strong>\u2013 which he described as \u201cgrossly inappropriate\u201d, but added: \u201cThe evidence suggests that it is highly unlikely he could be prosecuted for sexual abuse\u201d \u2013 but with Soon-Yi.</p> <p>In my many years of debating the Allen case with friends and colleagues, it is usually at this point, when the issues around the original accusation become too byzantine to follow, that people pivot to Soon-Yi. A relationship with a 21-year-old woman is not the same as molesting a seven-year-old girl, but the conflation of the two scandals is understandable: this saga around Allen assumed biblical proportions and his affair with Soon-Yi was the original sin.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are very confused about this. They think Soon-Yi was my adopted daughter, that I lived with Mia [in the same apartment as Soon-Yi], that I was married to Mia \u2013 they have all kinds of crazy thoughts,\u201d says Allen. Yet she was, undeniably, Allen\u2019s partner\u2019s daughter and he had known her since she was a child (although Wilk confirmed that Allen had almost no contact with her until 1990, when she was 20). Their affair was not a legal crime, but in the eyes of many it was \u2013 and is \u2013 a moral one. <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/woody-allen-mia-farrow-son-338694\">A</a><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/woody-allen-mia-farrow-son-338694\">s Ronan </a><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/woody-allen-mia-farrow-son-338694\">pointed out on Twitter in 2012</a>, when Allen married Soon-Yi, he turned his own children into his siblings-in-law.</p> <p>At the time, Soon-Yi was treated as both the predator (\u201cSoon-Yi does not exist,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-47408185\">said</a> her adoptive father, Andr\u00e9 Previn) and the victim: in Wilk\u2019s custody ruling, he says that Farrow called Allen \u201ca child molester\u201d in July 1992 \u2013 a month before the alleged incident with Dylan \u2013 with regard to his relationship with Soon-Yi, while also \u201cdefacing\u201d photos of her daughter. <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2018/09/soon-yi-previn-speaks.html\">Soon-Yi</a><a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2018/09/soon-yi-previn-speaks.html\"> has long insisted that she was far from either</a>. She is now 49 and has been with Allen for 28 years, married for 23, and raised two daughters, Bechet, 23, and Manzie, 20. Yet the longevity of their relationship, instead of proving its validity, has acted for many as a reminder of Allen\u2019s original transgression. The same year Allen and Farrow were in court, Jerry Seinfeld, then 38, <a href=\"https://people.com/archive/cover-story-the-game-of-love-vol-41-no-11/\">started </a><a href=\"https://people.com/archive/cover-story-the-game-of-love-vol-41-no-11/\">seeing</a><a href=\"https://people.com/archive/cover-story-the-game-of-love-vol-41-no-11/\"> a 17-year-old</a>, Shoshanna Lonstein.

(\u201cFew if anyone realised I was simply quoting Saul Bellow quoting Emily Dickinson, not actually describing a philosophy of my own,\u201d he writes in Apropos of Nothing. And he is right: few realised that.) But, in 1992, he had more sympathy with people\u2019s criticisms: \u201cThe first days [after the accusation of molestation], I thought: this is completely justifiable. I\u2019ve turned up in an affair with another woman and that other woman is her daughter,\u201d he said in an interview with the US news programme 60 Minutes.</p> <p>Is there any part of him that thinks he brought all this on himself?</p> <p>\u201cNo, and I\u2019ll tell you why,\u201d he replies, without hesitation. \u201cI realised [the relationship with Soon-Yi] had dramatic impact and was not usual: one could make criticisms about the rectitude of it, the appropriateness of it; I understood all of that. But these false accusations that have hurt the psychological life of Ronan and Dylan; I don\u2019t feel for one second that I brought that on myself.\u201d</p> <p>Allen can be, at best, naive and, at worst, obtuse. Reviewers of the memoir have gleefully pulled out the comments he makes about Scarlett Johansson and L\u00e9a Seydoux\u2019s attractiveness, while ignoring his long paeans on the talents of Diane Keaton, Dianne Wiest, Judy Davis and many more. He writes that he has \u201ca reputation as someone obsessed with young women. I have used the May-December ploy as a comic and romantic theme a few times, just as I have used psychoanalysis or murder or Jewish jokes, but only as good material for plots and laughs.\u201d</p> <p>This is true, but you will never guess which of these plots features in Rainy Day (clue: it is not psychoanalysis or murder). So I ask, given that he knows what people think about him, did he not consider ditching the plotline about the middle-aged director (Liev Schreiber) lusting after a college student (Elle Fanning), or declining to make a joke in his memoir about Johansson\u2019s pheromones?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The facts don\u2019t matter. For some reason, emotionally, it\u2019s important for them to buy into the story</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cNo, I never think about that for a second,\u201d he says. \u201c It\u2019s hard enough to get a good joke for the situation. That\u2019s what you concern yourself with. The rest is of absolutely no importance.\u201d In other words: Allen does not think he needs to tread carefully, because he has done nothing wrong.</p> <p>In his memoir, Allen\u2019s recollections of the allegation and its fallout seethe with sadness and occasional fury. But, in conversation, he&nbsp;speaks about the effect that all this has had on his life and career&nbsp;with measured calmness.&nbsp;I remark on his lack of anger. \u201cFrom that perspective, I\u2019m not angry. I\u2019m angry that I was deprived of seeing my children grow up and I\u2019m angry at what\u2019s been done to Dylan and Ronan. I haven\u2019t spoken a word to the children in over 25 years and they\u2019ve been raised to think the worst of me. So sure, I was angry about that. But, professionally, I haven\u2019t suffered at all,\u201d he says.</p> <p>This is demonstrably untrue. Aside from the actors who won\u2019t work with him, Amazon Studios pulled out of a four-movie deal with him (one of those movies was Rainy Day) after Allen said in a 2018 interview: \u201cI should be the poster boy for the #MeToo movement. I\u2019ve worked with hundreds of actresses and not a single one has ever suggested any kind of impropriety at all.\u201d This is true: Allen has an excellent record with female actors, always giving them equal pay. Despite being one of the most closely watched men in the business, there have never even been rumours of harassment. But Amazon claimed Allen\u2019s comment \u201csabotaged\u201d the project. Allen sued and he and Amazon settled last year, but, as a result, Rainy Day does not have a US distributor.</p> <p>\u201cThis plays into my poetic fantasies to be an artist whose work isn\u2019t seen in his own country and is forced, because of injustice, to have his public abroad. Henry Miller comes to mind. DH Lawrence. James Joyce. I see myself standing amongst them defiantly. It\u2019s about at that point my wife wakes me up and says, You\u2019re snoring,\u201d he writes in Apropos of Nothing.</p> <p>In the past decade, he has been <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4151320/\">cut out of documentaries</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/critics-notebook-why-i-will-never-watch-a-woody-allen-film-again-1063776\">boycotted by film reviewers</a>. He is considered too riddled with scandal even for the Clintons; Hillary\u2019s presidential campaign returned his and Soon-Yi\u2019s donation: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t help wondering if another fifty-four hundred would have enabled her to carry Pennsylvania, Michigan or Ohio,\u201d he writes in the book. External opinion, it turns out, does matter.</p> <p>Allen is innocent: this is according to the law and the agencies that investigated him. Dylan and Ronan believe he is guilty. It is the latter view that has led some to <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/02/26/uc-san-diego-academic-senate-rejects-student-led-push-cut-course-woody-allen\">lobby universities to drop him from film courses</a>, exclude his movies from film festivals and talk about him as if he were a criminal. But this attitude is immoral unless it is proved he committed a crime \u2013 and, 28 years later, no one has been able to pin so much as a parking fine on him.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Omp-oI4PyY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4Omp-oI4PyY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch the trailer for A Rainy Day in New York.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Many point to his movies as evidence of wrongdoing, but it is the height of intellectual laziness to conflate film plots about older men and twentysomething women with child molestation. A 21-year-old woman is not \u2013 and this, apparently, cannot be said enough with regard to Allen \u2013 a seven-year-old girl. It is extraordinary how many people argue otherwise, claiming to do so in the name of feminism. You may not like Allen\u2019s movies \u2013 or his marriage \u2013 but people can be complicated, even unlikable, without being criminal.</p> <p>There are signs that <a href=\"https://quillette.com/2020/05/25/ronan-farrows-botched-journalism-is-troubling-the-response-to-it-has-been-worse/\">some people</a> are starting to realise this, and to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/17/business/media/ronan-farrow.html\">question some of the narratives around him</a>. Despite the pandemic, the lack of a US release and having been disowned by its star and other cast and crew members, Rainy Day is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/13/woody-allen-rainy-day-in-new-york-tops-global-box-office\">Allen\u2019s most successful film in years</a>. Perhaps the public simply wearied of a story that has not changed in decades. Perhaps some took the time to read the facts.</p> <p>Allen says several times during our conversation that he is completely fine: he can still make movies, even if they are not shown in his own country, and Bechet and Manzie are, he says, wholly untouched by the scandal, even though they are of the generation that thinks he is Satan. \u201cThey\u2019re great, because this has always been a total non-issue in their lives. This is because none of us here make a big deal out of it and it has not impacted them in any negative way whatsoever,\u201d he says, proudly. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/25/woody-allen-traumas-in-life-weaken-us-cafe-society-amazon\">Woody Allen: 'There are traumas in life that weaken us.

  "<p>Nearly 2,000 immigration staff, including workers at the UK\u2019s ports and airports, were off sick with Covid-19 symptoms in the first four months of the year, with more than half absent before the lockdown was imposed, the Guardian can reveal.</p> \n<p>Between 1 January and 29 April there were 1,880 Border Force and UK Visas &amp; Immigration (UKVI) staff recorded as beginning a period of sickness absence due to Covid-19 symptoms, equal to 12% of the combined workforce for both agencies.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Of these, 516 Border Force and 529 UKVI workers were off before 23 March, a total of 1,045 or 7% of the combined workforce. The absences peaked in the week to 22 March, just before lockdown, for both agencies. Only five of the cases were recorded between 1 January and 1 March.</p> \n<p>Unions representing immigration staff reacted to the figures with anger and criticised the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) provided to workers.</p> \n<p>Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, the biggest union representing Border Force staff, said: \u201cBorder Force management&nbsp;have at some airports actively told PCS members at passport&nbsp;control not to wear PPE because it gave the \u2018wrong impression\u2019 to travelling passengers.</p> \n<p>\u201cWell, the impression they&nbsp;have given is that they care&nbsp;more about image than the health and safety of Border Force staff. And these figures are a searing indictment of their approach.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lucy Moreton, of the Immigration Services Union, said: \u201cThe statistics clearly show the impact on staff prior to the lockdown and the immediate impact that had in limiting the spread of the virus amongst Border Force and UKVI staff.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cObtaining suitable PPE for staff, particularly staff at the border, is an ongoing struggle.&nbsp;Although sickness rates amongst border and immigration staff never reached the \u201ccritical\u201d 30% of absence which Home Office originally planned for, there is no excuse for the failures to protect key workers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cStaff at the border see staff in supermarkets, delivery drivers etc \u2013 as much key workers as they themselves are \u2013 wearing masks, face shields [and encourage to adopt] social distancing measures.&nbsp;Yet they continue to attend work actively discouraged from complying with the government recommendations regarding face coverings and with masks issued as PPE only in very limited circumstances.\u201d</p> \n<p>The figures were provided to the Labour MP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/stephen-doughty\">Stephen Doughty</a> in answer to a parliamentary question.</p> \n<p>There were 23.7m arrivals into the UK by air, land and sea in the first three months of the year, including 18.1m arrivals by air between 1 January and 23 March. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/patrick-vallance\">Sir Patrick Vallance</a>, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, told MPs there was \u201ca big influx\u201d of coronavirus cases from Italy and Spain in early March.</p> \n<p>Doughty, a former member of the home affairs select committee, told the Guardian: \u201cThis shocking revelation in answer to my question shows one of the likely impacts of failing to introduce proper measures to protect staff at the border when they were most needed \u2013 in the first quarter of the year \u2013 when over 23 million British and other travellers entered the UK without proper health checks or formal quarantine.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhile some of this illness will have undoubtedly been picked up outside of work, the fact Sir Patrick Vallance admitted that we had imported many, many cases, coupled with these figures, suggests that many frontline staff may have been exposed and infected in the course of their work.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe government must urgently publish the scientific advice it used, and an explanation for their failure to act when it could have made a difference.\u201d</p> \n<p>At least two Border Force staff have contracted Covid-19 and died.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Critics of the government\u2019s approach have questioned if more could have been done to screen arrivals earlier in the pandemic, particularly from hotspots, including Wuhan in China \u2013 the source of the Covid-19 outbreak \u2013 and northern Italy.</p> \n<p>Of the 18.1 million arrivals between 1 January and 23 March, only 273 passengers on three flights from Wuhan and one flight from Japan were formally quarantined in government-supported isolation facilities.</p> \n<p>The government stopped issuing guidance at the border to arrivals from specific countries \u2013 including from Italy and China \u2013 to self-isolate on 13 March, 10 days before the lockdown was imposed. Since then, there has been little intervention other than advice provided on leaflets and posters. There were more than 100,000 arrivals by air into the UK in April.</p> \n<p>Since then, the government has announced it is to enforce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/22/uk-arrivals-8-june-quarantine-for-14-days-coronavirus\">a 14-day period of self isolation for all arrivals into the UK</a> from 8 June, prompting many to question why such a policy was not implemented earlier in the crisis.</p> \n<p>The figures also show that in the first four months of the year, there were a further 2,345 Border Force and UKVI staff recorded as beginning a period of isolation at home either because a member of their household had Covid-19 symptoms or because the employee themselves was vulnerable to infection. Only five of the cases were recorded between 1 January and 1 March.</p> \n<p>Combined with those that had fallen ill themselves, this totals 27% of the workforce for Border Force and UKVI.</p> \n<p>The most recent Home Office annual report, published in June last year, showed there were 8,127 permanent employees at Border Force and 7,422 workers at UK Visas &amp; Immigration, a total of 15,549.</p> \n<p>The answers were provided by the minister for immigration compliance, Chris Philp. </p> \n<p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe figures show Border Force and UKVI absences due to coronavirus are consistent with those across the UK at the time.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe safety of the public and our staff is of paramount importance, which is why Border Force staff have been provided with the necessary personal protective equipment. Protective screens have been installed in ports, and we are ensuring social distancing is maintained in passenger arrivals areas.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>At first it was a mystery \u2013 short vertical lines scratched into the wooden panelling on the side of the veranda, like days counted off by a prisoner.

  "<p>The new National Party leader, Todd Muller, had been at pains to portray himself as a solid, serious, safe pair of hands, in contrast to the increasingly Trumpian leanings of Simon Bridges, who Muller deposed in a leadership coup last Friday.</p> <p>But after an uneventful, if uninspiring, first press conference, Muller\u2019s debut week quickly took a horror turn. He became enmeshed in a scrap with media and commentators over his Maga hat, doubling down on his intention to display it in his new office, but later capitulating under pressure.</p> <p>He was then forced to defend an all-white frontbench, as reporters asked why there were no M\u0101ori MPs in his senior leadership. This took a farcical turn when his deputy Nikki Kaye, desperately casting about for a high-ranking M\u0101ori MP, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/i-am-not-maori-new-zealand-mp-corrects-party-deputy-leader-amid-diversity-criticism\">wrongly identified finance spokesperson Paul Goldsmith as M\u0101ori</a>, to the scarcely concealed amusement of recently dispatched M\u0101ori deputy leader Paula Bennett.</p> <p>Muller has also been subjected to a series of embarrassing leaks from his own caucus, including the allegation that the new leadership has set up an intelligence unit designed to dig up dirt on opponents leading up to the election.</p> <p>Even when he was given a chance to offer his vision for New Zealand\u2019s economic recovery in a serious interview with TVNZ he was unable to redeem himself, admitting he had no firm plan.</p> <p>With the election just 16 weeks away and support for National having collapsed \u2013 the most recent polls show them dropping 17 points, from 46% to just 29% \u2013 National\u2019s chances of deposing Jacinda Ardern\u2019s government at the general election on 19 September already seemed slim.</p> <p>This week Muller has discovered that carrying out a successful coup is one thing, but leading a party is something else altogether, particularly when your own caucus is bitterly divided.</p> <p>However, things will inevitably settle down and a rebound in the polls for National is likely. As fanciful as it seems right now, a win in September is not even off the cards. This may hinge on whether Winston Peters\u2019 NZ First makes it back in, and if Muller wants to repair the damaged relationship between their parties.</p> <p>Much will also depend on how well Muller manages to direct his party back towards the centre of the political spectrum, and whether he can provide a credible alternative to the government\u2019s economic management through the coming recession.</p> <p>Inside National there have long been rumblings that, under the leadership of Bridges and Bennett, National had drifted too far to the right and into social conservatism. The focus will now be much less on law and order, gangs, or even on the lockdown, but instead on the economy. In light of the looming recession, this will soon be the only topic of real importance to voters. National will hope that the coming dislocation and suffering, brought about by mass unemployment and business failures will make voters doubt the government\u2019s ability to manage the country out of recession.</p> <p>We\u2019ve already seen that Muller is determined to push the interests of small business. This is clever, as so much of the New Zealand economy is based on small to medium enterprises. A report published this week by Infometrics suggests that 80% of the coming job losses are likely to be from small businesses.</p> <p>Muller\u2019s beige persona might not actually be a bad thing for National. As a \u201cblank slate\u201d he could allow voters who to project positive attributes onto him. Certainly, having a lack of baggage and declared political views makes him less of a target for opponents. In electing Muller, National has chosen to try to make the election campaign less about a personality contest against Ardern (which they would clearly lose).&nbsp;</p> <p>In fact, New Zealanders generally don\u2019t like their leaders to be too colourful, ideological or intellectual. Popular leaders such as Helen Clark, John Key, or even Ardern haven\u2019t been particularly exciting or bold in their political work.</p> <p>Even Muller\u2019s unfortunate stumble into the culture wars is unlikely to cost him. Controversies over Muller\u2019s Trump hat and the ethnicity of his senior colleagues have been embarrassing, and they\u2019re exactly the sort of issues that the new leader has wanted to leave behind as he replaces Bridges. But many swing voters will have watched as the media applied the blowtorch over the hat and the white frontbench, and been less than sympathetic to the criticisms.</p> <p>In the end, while a torrid first week in the job is something of a setback for the new leader, Muller\u2019s poor performance will soon be forgotten if he quickly gets his act together. Crucially, he needs to come up with something more solid in terms of his plans for dealing with the recession \u2013 he will need to make some sort of major announcement in the next week or so. As the economic impact of Covid-19 bites hard, these early setbacks are likely to be forgotten by a public more concerned with the recession than interview techniques, frontbench personnel, and hats.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Bryce Edwards is a senior associate at the Institute for Governance and Policy Studies at Victoria University, Wellington, New Zealand</em></p></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p>",

Patients, many with coronavirus symptoms and strapped two to a single oxygen tank, were captured lying almost on top of each other, top-to-toe on shared stretchers or just lying on the floor, in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-asia-india-52818777/india-coronavirus-patients-share-beds-in-overrun-mumbai-hospital\">footage shared on social media</a> in India this week.</p> <p>Mumbai, a city of more than 20 million people, is weeks into the pandemic, but with new cases showing no sign of slowing down the city\u2019s already weak healthcare system appears to be on the brink of collapse.

According to doctors and officials, the peak began on 6 May, but the curve is showing no signs of flattening, and cases are still doubling every week.</p> <p>With state-run hospitals quickly running out of beds and keeping symptomatic patients waiting, the Mumbai municipal corporation has raced to convert a series of stadiums and office complexes into coronavirus wards and quarantine centres.</p> <p>A makeshift hospital with 1,000 beds, including intensive care facilities, was built in the city\u2019s business district, the Bandra Kurla Complex. The National Sports Club of India stadium is being converted into a 600-bed quarantine and ICU facility, while the Mumbai planetarium will house 300 beds and the Nehru science centre will be made into a quarantine facility for those living in slums. Private hospitals have also been ordered to give over dozens of their beds for Covid-19 patients.</p> <p>A Mumbai municipal corporation spokesperson, Vijay Khabale, denied that coronavirus patients were being denied beds. \u201cThere are enough beds but there is a lack of coordination with other agencies, which is why there are these reports. The present situation is that we have more than enough beds and quarantine facilities.\u201d</p> <p>Khabale said that all the new facilities would be completed within the week, but he was optimistic they would not need to be used at full capacity. \u201cWe are expecting that within a day or two that the cases will begin to flatten and then begin to decrease,\u201d he insisted, adding: \u201cWe have it under control.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a849c71933dc1588b71109bf18bb5d558ad57f0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a849c71933dc1588b71109bf18bb5d558ad57f0a/0_0_4160_2496/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nurses light candles at Rajiv Gandhi hospital in Kochi to mark international nurses day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nurses light candles at Rajiv Gandhi hospital in Kochi to mark international nurses day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arun Sankar/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, many doctors fear that the worse is still to come. India has been under one of the world\u2019s strictest lockdowns since 24 March, but it has only slowed down the spread of the virus, rather than flattening the curve of cases. India ranks 4th in the world for new cases recorded each day, and with lockdown due to be loosened at the end of this week there are fears it will prompt a spike in infection rates, for which the hospitals are not prepared. India has had 158,000 reported cases.</p> <p>To complicate matters further, the beginning of June will bring the monsoon and the outbreaks of dengue fever, malaria and leptospirosis, which already inundate hospitals on an annual basis. Last year India officially reported more than 67,000 cases of dengue, though the real figure is thought to be much higher.</p> <p>According to the human rights activist Abraham Mathai, who runs the All India Nurses Association, dozens of patients with non-Covid related diseases are dying because they are being denied access to treatment, with some Mumbai hospitals ordered to only take in Covid-19 patients. Last week, 15-year-old Pawan Maddibona died after six hospitals refused to give him dialysis treatment for his kidneys.</p> <p>\u201cNon-Covid patients have a right to live, they have a right to get their treatments,\u201d said Mathai. \u201cThere has to be some kind of balanced policies so non-Covid patients don\u2019t suffer.\u201d</p> <p>Shetty from Guru Nanak hospital said his main fear was the as-yet unknown combination of coronavirus with the monsoon diseases, something other countries further through the pandemic had not been forced to face. \u201cIt will be a whole worrying new realm,\u201d he said. \u201cMy guess is we will need a lot of beds to cope.\u201d</p>",
