  "<p>When new books are published, PR companies often send copies out for review with a small title-appropriate gift attached \u2013 a little net bag of confetti or sugared almonds with a book about a wedding, for instance, or an envelopeful of spiders that can give you quite a turn to accompany a modern gothic thriller, and so on.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.sky.com/watch/breeders\" title=\"\">Breeders</a> (Sky One), starring Martin Freeman and Daisy Haggard as Paul and Ally, the beleaguered parents of two children, should be broadcast \u2013 depending on viewers\u2019 own parental status \u2013 with either packets of Valium or birth-control products attached. The 10-part series is technically a comedy, but it hits so many pressure points so hard in such rapid succession that if you do laugh it will be through some quite considerable anxiety and pain. I mean that as a compliment.</p> <p>The first of the two opening episodes (shown back to back, possibly to ram home the unrelenting nature of parenthood) followed the bleak and unforgiving trail of a sleepless night for the family. Seven-year-old Luke is wrestling with his fear of fire \u2013 sparked, naturally, by a safety lecture at school \u2013 and his younger sister, Ava, is happy to keep him company in his wakeful hours. After some initial emotional blackmail and rigorous horse trading \u2013 and if you don\u2019t recognise the truth of this in your bones, then keep rolling on those condoms and enjoying your lives \u2013 Paul and Ally settle into 90-minute shifts. Ally recites The Hungry Caterpillar from memory and a state of semi-consciousness. Paul \u2013 caught in the double bind of being tired from the sleepless night and enraged by it \u2013 finds it harder to maintain equilibrium and hisses profanities at the ticking clock. </p> <p>He is not much better with the children. Your mileage may vary, of course, but I did find the level of fury he expressed towards them frequently fell outside the margins of understandable and into \u201cquite flipping frightening, actually\u201d. And I had to wonder if any partner would have been quite so smilingly sympathetic, as Ally often was, to someone who had lost his rag so fully with their children.</p> <p>Another bum note, perhaps, came during one of the flashbacks to earlier, more halcyon days, and an IVF storyline whose inescapable sadness made the pursuit of gags feel tawdry. But the flashbacks themselves were a rare demonstration of the overlooked truth that the days of having a newborn, while obviously in a class of their own, can be easier in some ways than the years to come, when the novelty of creating a family has very much worn off.</p> <p>The second episode was a little more lighthearted \u2013 if still about as far from the essentially cosy delights of Outnumbered (which I love on its own glorious terms, by the way) as you can get. There were more standard tropes at work, including the annoyingly polished and successful couple on the school run (\u201cWith their fucking outfits. We\u2019re best, aren\u2019t we?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re best\u201d), a school production of Robin Hood and a parents\u2019 evening. But the foraging for tiny embers of hope in the teacher\u2019s bland words about a perfectly average child and attempting to fan them into flames has surely rarely been better captured.</p> <p>Similarly well handled was the evocation of the shifting sands on which parents try, uselessly, to build firm foundations for their children\u2019s emotional, physical, professional, financial and any other kind of goddamn wellbeing you can think of. And doing all that before they can collapse into bed at the end of another brutal day. Paul and Ally\u2019s differing and evolving attitudes to what to look for in an education for tiny children was emblematic of all.</p> <p>Interwoven with the day-to-day slog and the minutiae of parenting (the interruption of an intense, muttered conversation about the children\u2019s schooling, for example, to quieten them in the bathroom, was beautiful) are larger, more intangible issues. What do you with the disappointments life inevitably hands you (Paul, who once wanted to be a cartoonist, loses out on a promotion at the charity where he has worked for 22 years)? And what forms do relationships take when, for most of the time, you feel like comrades in adversity at best (\u201cUnderneath all the madness,\u201d Ally says to her colleague, Darren, \u201cPaul and I love each other very, very probably\u201d)? Take all the tablets you can, and watch. Even if you don\u2019t enjoy, you will learn.</p>",

Beauchamp says she has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/28/senior-public-servant-tells-inquiry-she-destroyed-sports-grants-meeting-notes\">no memory of the meeting</a> and tells the inquiry she has destroyed all her private notes, so can\u2019t check.</p> <p><strong>2 March 2020 </strong>\u2013 The ANAO tells the Senate inquiry that the 8.46am 11 April email contained \u201cone project coming out and one project coming in \u2026 that was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/04/new-email-puts-morrison-back-in-firing-line-over-sports-rorts\">at the request of the prime minister\u2019s office\u201d </a>and that another email, sent at 12.43pm that same day, while the government was in caretaker mode, contained more changes, but that \u201cnone were evident as being at the request of the prime minister\u2019s office\u201d, rather than the minister\u2019s office making the changes\u201d. The last update saw nine projects added, with one removed.</p> <p><strong>4 March 2020 \u2013 </strong>Sport Australia acknowledges <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/04/new-email-puts-morrison-back-in-firing-line-over-sports-rorts\">it failed to tell the Senate inquiry</a> about a second email it received from McKenzie\u2019s office, with a list of funded projects on the day the election was called, which arrived at 12.43pm on 11 April, well into caretaker mode. It dismissed the omission as an error, and said it did not believe it had misled the Senate.</p> <p>Maurice Blackburn writes to Sport Australia demanding that it agree by 17 March to remake a decision and provide a grant to its client Beechworth Lawn Tennis Club, or else face federal court action.</p> <p><strong>5 March 2020 \u2013</strong> McKenzie releases her first statement since resigning, maintaining she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/06/bridget-mckenzie-reignites-sports-rorts-affair-by-denying-late-changes-to-grants\">made no changes</a> to the funded projects after she signed the brief on 4 April. She says <a href=\"http://www.bridgetmckenzie.com.au/Media/Media-Releases/ID/1265/Statement--Senate-Estimates\">she does not know</a> who added nine projects and remove one but takes responsibility as the minister in charge at the time.</p> <p><strong>6 March 2020 \u2013 </strong>Morrison <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/06/scott-morrison-refuses-to-take-questions-about-timing-of-changes-to-sports-grants\">refuses to take questions</a> on the sports grants affair at a press conference.</p> <p><strong>8 March 2020</strong> \u2013 It is revealed Sport Australia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/08/sport-australia-defies-senate-on-questions-over-sports-rorts-grants\">defied a Senate order</a> to respond to 40 questions on notice about what it knew about the government\u2019s spreadsheets, and contact it had with the minister\u2019s and prime minister\u2019s office. Beauchamp says she and Sport Australia Commission chair John Wylie have \u201cno specific recollection\u201d of the meeting Palmer said the trio held after seeing one of the spreadsheets. The health department says it has no notes or record of the meeting. Labor asks the attorney-general to investigate whether or not Beauchamp had the authority to destroy her notes.</p> <p><strong>16 March 2020 \u2013 </strong>the Senate inquiry is due to hear from McKenzie and Gaetjens.</p>",
  "<p>It was a case of silence and stalemate for Wolves as they emerged from Olympiakos\u2019s quietened cauldron with a draw and an away goal. The result was decent enough against the team that dramatically beat Arsenal in the previous round, but with their opponents reduced to 10 men with more than an hour remaining they might have taken a firmer grip on the tie. Perhaps, however, their players could be forgiven for approaching the fixture with a certain lack of enthusiasm.</p> <p>Wolves always thought this game was \u201can unnecessary risk\u201d, failing in an attempt to convince Uefa to abandon it, while shortly before kick-off Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo described the very idea of playing it as \u201cabsurd\u201d. None of this will be found in any motivational handbook, and the players often appeared unsure whether this was a game they were determined to win or desperate to avoid.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/mar/12/olympiakos-v-wolves-europa-league-last-16-live\">Olympiakos v Wolves: Europa League last 16 \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The famously fiery stands of the Stadio Georgios Karaiskakis were rendered silent by a coronavirus-based supporter ban, but the home side still started on the front foot. Adama Traor\u00e9 did offer some respite with his runs down the right, but twice his crosses found Diogo Jota competing with the 6ft 3in centre-back R\u00faben Semedo in the middle, a hopeless mismatch.</p> <p>But with just under half an hour played that battle swung heavily in Wolves\u2019 favour. A spell of Olympiakos pressure ended with the visitors springing forward on the counter, the referee waved play on when Traor\u00e9 was brought down in the centre circle and Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez found Jota, who raced forward, prodded the ball past Semedo and was tripped, just outside the area. There was no intimidatory atmosphere to coax the French official towards leniency \u2013 not for nothing had Olympiakos had to deal with only one sending-off at home in the last five years, and that in 2017 \u2013 and Cl\u00e9ment Turpin reached immediately for a red.</p> <p>Wolves\u2019 priority had been to contain and frustrate, and even with a numerical advantage they remained cautious. There were only two shots on target in the first half, both from the home side and neither at all threatening. The But with the home side now committing numbers to defence Wolves took control of possession in the early stages of the second half, a period of apparent comfort if no great attacking ambition that suddenly ended when Olympiakos scored on the break.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/12/manchester-united-thrash-lask-linz-in-front-of-empty-stands\">Manchester United thrash Lask in front of empty stands in Europa League</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mohamed Camara, for the first and only time in the game, set off on a run down the right before passing infield to Guilherme, whose surge towards the box had left R\u00faben Vinagre trailing miserably in his wake, and he reached the byline before sending the ball across goal, where Youssef El Arabi, despite R\u00faben Neves\u2019s last-ditch, desperate attempt to intervene, had a tap-in.</p> <p>Wolves soon resettled and five minutes later Neves\u2019s pass created a fabulous opportunity for Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez, who lashed a vicious shot straight into the face of the home goalkeeper, Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1. Soon afterwards they were level, with Andreas Bouchalakis twice a villain for Olympiakos. First he fouled Jota 25 yards out, then at the free-kick he strayed from the wall and deflected Neto\u2019s unpromising low shot into his own net.</p> <p>The remainder of the match was as meek as the empty stands. \u201cI think both teams, the energy levels were missing someone to push,\u201d said Nuno. \u201cIt was not a very good game of football.

It\u2019s impossible to know where this is all going: will the second leg happen? Will the competition be completed? Will anyone care by the time that happens? But here we are, so here we are.</p> <p>Rangers have struggled in the league recently, chucking away points faster than Steven Gerrard can dispense blame, but their performance against Braga in the last round of this competition was magnificent. They were thoroughly outclassed in the first leg, somehow coming back from 0-2 down to win 3-2 on a memorable Ibrox night, before a confident, disciplined performance saw them not only qualify but record a seriously impressive away win in the process. </p> <p>Tonight, though, they face an entirely different proposition. Leverkusen are a serious outfit and have beaten Dortmund, Bayern and Atl\u00e9tico this season, as well as beating Porto in both legs of the last 32. They\u2019re also in form, having won four of their last five league games \u2013 the draw in that run came away to Leipzig \u2013 beat Eintracht Frankfurt 4-0 at the weekend \u2013 and in Kai Havertz have one of the best young players in the world. Roughly, it\u2019s impossible to see a way for Rangers in this tie, except as the most profound of perpetual teenagers will tell you, the world often fails to do what it\u2019s meant to. </p> <p><strong>Kick-off: 8pm GM</strong><strong>T</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T16:06:57.110Z\">at 4.06pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

  "<p>The brother of the Manchester suicide bomber decided not to give evidence at his own trial because his cover story \u2013 placing all the blame on his dead sibling \u2013 had been revealed as an attempt to \u201cpull the wool over the eyes\u201d of investigators, a court heard</p> <p>Hashem Abedi was accused of standing shoulder to shoulder with his brother, Salman, sharing a common goal to kill and maim as many people as possible in what proved to be one of the deadliest terror attacks the UK has seen, the Old Bailey heard.</p> <p>Abedi had acted as quartermaster, chauffeur and technician in the planning of the attack and had tried to evade responsibility for the \u201ccruel and cowardly carnage\u201d unleashed on his innocent victims by blaming his brother, according to the prosecution.</p> <p>On Thursday, during the final days of his trial, Abedi, 22 \u2013 who is accused of helping to plan the May 2017 attack and helping to build the suicide bomb that his brother detonated at the end of an Ariana Grande concert \u2013 sacked his legal team and declined to give evidence in his own defence or to be present in the dock.</p> <p>Justice Jeremy Baker told the jury, who had sat through six weeks of evidence, that Abedi no longer wanted to participate in his own trial and that it would proceed to a conclusion without Abedi\u2019s presence.</p> <p>Prior to the jury being informed of his decision, Abedi\u2019s lead counsel, Stephen Kamlish QC, and his team, who had represented him for almost four months, left the courtroom. Abedi had been represented by the renowned human rights and civil liberties law firm Birnberg Pierce. The firm are currently representing Shamima Begum, and previous clients have included the family of Jean Charles de Menezes and Guant\u00e1namo detainee Moazzam Begg.</p> <p>Baker instructed the jury not to draw any adverse conclusions from Abedi\u2019s absence from the courtroom, informing them he would be limiting the prosecution\u2019s closing speeches in the interest of \u201cbalance and fairness\u201d as no one would now be making a submission on Abedi\u2019s behalf.</p> <p>In his closing speech, prosecutor Duncan Penny, described Abedi\u2019s absence as a \u201cthundering silence\u201d and an attempt to avoid exposing his own guilt and alleged involvement in the bomb plot.</p> <p>Referring to Abedi\u2019s only defence \u2013 a statement given to police last summer after being extradited from Libya in which he denied any involvement \u2013 Penny said it was \u201cdemonstratively riddled with lies\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt was an attempt by the defendant to pull the wool over the eyes of the investigators and point the finger of responsibility at his dead brother. At its most fundamental level it was an attempt to evade responsibility for his own culpability for the cruel and cowardly carnage,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The former Burnage high school pupil, who studied electronics at college, attempted to portray himself as yet another victim of his extremist brother, the court was told. Jurors heard how Abedi answered \u201cno comment\u201d in police interviews after being extradited to the UK last year, but handed detectives a prepared statement in which he said he \u201ccould not comprehend\u201d his brother\u2019s actions.</p> <p>However, Penny argued he was \u201cjust as responsible for this atrocity \u2026 as surely as if he had selected the target and detonated the bomb himself\u201d, spending months working alongside his brother collecting ingredients and building prototype bombs until the final device was assembled.</p> <p>He said the reason for his reluctance to go into the witness box was because he was in on the plan, \u201cfrom start to finish\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe simple truth is, he was a willing and skilled accomplice, acting at all times with his brother to bring about the common goal.\u201d</p> <p>Penny went through a series of questions he would have asked the accused given the chance, including the purchase of a Nissan Micra used to store bomb-making equipment; the reason for his finger and thumbprints on improvised detonators and prototype explosive devices made out of tin cans; and the reason for having 10 different mobile phones in the months leading up to the bombing; and \u201cwhether in truth the reason he has chosen not to give evidence is because there is no answer to the questions which would have been posed.\u201d</p> <p>He added Abedi had \u201cevery opportunity\u201d to give his side of the story in court, to denounce his brother and condemn his actions.</p> <p>But Penny claimed he chose not to do so because he was a \u201cwilling and skilled accomplice\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAt times a chauffeur, at times a quartermaster, at times an electrical technician. We suggest there is one reason he is absent - the questions that he would have had to have answered would quickly have revealed that he stood shoulder to shoulder with his dead brother steeped with shared culpability,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The trial continues.</p>",
  "<p>Anger is mounting in the US over the Trump administration\u2019s failure to test for coronavirus on a scale that could contain the outbreak and mitigate its most devastating impacts.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/mar/12/donald-tump-coronavirus-travel-ban-joe-biden-bernie-sanders-stock-markets-live-updates\">Trump has 'no plans' for coronavirus test despite contact with infected Bolsonaro aide \u2013 live</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>On Thursday the lack of testing capacity for Covid-19 was recognised in blunt terms by one of the top US officials dealing with the crisis. Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, described the current state of affairs as \u201ca failing\u201d at a hearing of the House oversight committee.</p> \n<p>From Congress to state capitals across the country, politicians of both main parties have shown rare bipartisan agreement that the pace of federal testing is woefully inadequate. Congress members who were given private briefings by Trump administration officials on Thursday expressed shock and outrage that so far only 11,000 tests have been conducted in a country of 327 million people.</p> \n<p>By contrast South Korea, which has been grappling with one of the most severe outbreaks of Covid-19 globally, tests roughly the same number, about 10,000 people, every day. In total, South Korea has tested <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/12/asia/coronavirus-south-korea-testing-intl-hnk/index.html\">230,000</a> of its 51 million people \u2013 130 times as many per capita as the US.</p> \n<p>The aggressive use of testing to identify carriers of the disease and quarantine them has been credited as a major factor in South Korea\u2019s relative success in dealing with the crisis.</p> \n<p>Answering press questions in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said: \u201cFrankly, the testing has been going very smooth.\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/1238138713919705089\">He added</a>: \u201cWe have heavily tested.\u201d</p> \n<p>That is factually incorrect, and a growing number of public officials, including from his own party, are willing to say so.</p> \n<p>Members of Congress who attended a bipartisan House briefing expressed anger about testing failures.</p> \n<p>Mike Quigley, a Democratic congressman from Illinois, said: \u201cWe are not where we need to be and not sure when we are going to get there. We are flying blind.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mark Walker, a Republican congressman from North Carolina, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/12/politics/congress-outrage-testing-covid-19/index.html\">told CNN</a> that there was \u201ca growing frustration among members as a whole to get more definitive answers\u201d. The Republican senator and former presidential nominee Mitt Romney of Utah said: \u201cOur system has just not been up to snuff and I think a lot of people are frustrated by it. I\u2019m one of them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York, which is one of the states hardest hit by the disease so far, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/03/12/andrew-cuomo-coronavirus-testing-intv-sot-cpt-vpx.cnn/video/playlists/coronavirus/\">told CNN</a> the US was \u201cway behind on testing\u201d. What he called a \u201cfederal bottleneck\u201d was so bad that he had authorised New York authorities to contract out testing to private laboratories.</p> \n<p>Cuomo said the paucity of testing not only prevented containment of localised outbreaks, it also gave the public a false sense of security by obscuring how prevalent the disease has already become. \u201cIt\u2019s because we have no testing capacity, that\u2019s why the numbers are low. If you actually had testing capacity you would see how high the numbers are already. As we do ramp up testing you are going to see those numbers go sky-high.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 March 2020. An earlier version referred to the number of specimens tested for Covid-19 in the US on March 10 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and public health labs. The figure at the time was just eight, but this was an incomplete figure. The CDC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing-in-us.html\">coronavirus database</a> indicates that the final figure for March 10 was 2,587. We have removed the section in question.</p>",
  "<p>Things fall apart. Just a little, at any rate. Moments after the latest Cobra meeting had broken up, Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, went rogue and gave her own press conference. </p> \n<p>The coronavirus pandemic had gone beyond the \u201ccontainment\u201d phase and into \u201cdelay\u201d. People with a dry cough and a fever should self-isolate. Large gatherings of more than 500 in Scotland would almost certainly be banned from Monday. Enough time to make sure the Old Firm derby between Rangers and Celtic could be played on Sunday.</p> \n<p>A little over an hour later, Boris Johnson emerged into the familiar setting of the Downing Street state room to give his third coronavirus presser inside two weeks. There will be plenty more to come. </p> \n<p>His message was pretty much identical to Sturgeon\u2019s, other than to declare that sports events and concerts would be going ahead in the rest of the UK for the foreseeable future. His irritation at being pre-empted by the first minister on further measures was mostly kept in check. Only a barb at the lack of resilience in the Scottish health service betrayed his feelings.</p> \n<p>Boris was here to tell the country we were in for a long haul, but he already looked on his knees. He has aged appreciably over the last few weeks. The eyes are puffier, the bags baggier and the complexion pastier. Being prime minister is turning out to be a lot less fun than becoming it. He looks sleep-deprived.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a6078f6-5a66-4d3e-9339-5610fe320767\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.</p>\n    <p>The UN agency&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public\">advises</a>&nbsp;people to:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap</li>\n     <li>Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing</li>\n     <li>Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough</li>\n     <li>Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers</li>\n     <li>Advice about face masks varies.

He isn\u2019t used to being held accountable for anything \u2013 his whole life up till now has been an exercise in self-indulgence \u2013 but he knows that he will be forever judged by the decisions he makes now. The smirking clown might have worked well for Brexit, but now the country is demanding a serious leader.</p> \n<p>Just for the moment, he is having to fake it to make it. And it\u2019s just about working. The man who has a psychological aversion to bad news is having to level with cosmological truths. </p> \n<p>The soft-soap, occasional comic asides and veneer of self-confidence have given way to something more real. The sense of despair and self-doubt that Boris has worked so hard throughout his life to keep internalised is now etched into every line of his face, drenched in every sentence he haltingly utters. Having to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-live-updates-who-declares-pandemic-as-italy-introduces-stricter-measures\">tell a lot of people they might die</a> can do that to you.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b7e32464-f444-4a08-abb9-e6a2cf8d9b80\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PA-MsoqRY5k?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Sensibly, Boris had once again come flanked by the new de facto joint prime ministers \u2013 the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance \u2013 and he rightly deferred to them on matters of science and epidemiology. Both men were hugely impressive: when they were sure of the numbers they said so, and when they weren\u2019t they also said so.</p> \n<p>There was no artifice, no bullshit. Just cold hard truths. We were about four weeks behind Italy and the virus might not peak for nine to 14 weeks. There was almost something reassuring in their lack of reassurance. For the first time in years, the public were being treated as adults. Just about the only question ducked was the one about what constituted being \u201cold\u201d. Something of personal concern to those of us in our early 60s.</p> \n<p>Inevitably, most of the questions from the media were about whether the UK was doing enough. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/eu-condemns-donald-trump-coronavirus-travel-ban\">Other countries</a> were closing schools, closing borders, closing down large public gatherings, closing travel. We were just advising people with symptoms to stay indoors for seven days, schools to cancel overseas trips, and people to wash their hands. With the proviso we would probably be implementing stricter measures at a later date.</p> \n<p>Not for the first time, it felt as if many in the country were ahead of the government in their response to the coronavirus. Many people had seen what was going down in Italy and had already cancelled large social gatherings, non-essential travel and were making plans to work from home where possible. Better safe than sorry.</p> \n<p>Boris, Whitty and Vallance were as one, though. The science was on their side. Which presumably meant that it wasn\u2019t on the side of all those countries who had made more radical, earlier interventions. </p> \n<p>The three amigos were insistent that if we moved too soon, people would get bored of taking the proper precautions when the pandemic spiked. Not everyone in the room was wholly convinced. The idea that everyone would be running round the streets coughing over one another when they knew the risk of infection was at its highest just because they had already been cooped up for a few weeks seemed far-fetched.</p> \n<p>But the science was the science. And Boris was banking on his science being the right science. He wasn\u2019t to be forced into doing anything before it could be shown to have a noticeable effect. </p> \n<p>In the meantime, he wished everyone well and asked for everyone to look out for one another. Especially the vulnerable and the elderly. Brexit was never going to bring the country together. But coronavirus just might. As he left the press conference, Boris had his fingers firmly crossed. So did I.</p>",

  "<p>Fireworks ignited outside the closed stadium marked the beginning of a last-16 tie that may not be completed next week due to coronavirus. The disease is causing more and more sport to be suspended so when Manchester United will hope to seal passage to the quarter-finals is unclear.</p> <p>Here, though, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side did what was needed, turning in a professional performance, cruising to victory before the smattering of Lask fans allowed entry. Their side did pose an occasional threat despite operating on a budget roughly similar to a League Two team.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/mar/12/lask-v-manchester-united-europa-league-last-16-live\">Lask 0-5 Manchester United: Europa League last 16 \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFor us it counts [even if competition is suspended], because to see the improvement of the team, the players \u2013 it\u2019s vital enough,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cIt [the empty stadium] makes it easier to get the instructions on the pitch but of course it\u2019s weird and a strange feeling.\u201d</p> <p>Victory also takes United to 11 matches unbeaten, equalling their best run under the Norwegian, the previous streak coming at the start of his incumbency. Solskj\u00e6r chose Odion Ighalo to replace the injured Anthony Martial and the Nigerian repaid the manager with a fine opener. This was his fourth goal in eight United appearances and the manager suggested his loan move may be made permanent.</p> <p>\u201cOdion has done really well \u2013 we need those qualities for next season so let\u2019s see,\u201d said Solskj\u00e6r, who went on to suggest the unsettled Paul Pogba, absent here, could also remain at the club beyond the summer. \u201cPaul is our player and has got two years left on his contract \u2013 a year and the option of another year, so you can expect Paul to be here, yes.\u201d</p> <p>Bruno Fernandes again led the way, trotting forward with the ball during the early exchanges and teeing up Fred, though the Brazilian blazed over. Next he won a free-kick with a slick flick-and-pirouette around an opponent. It yielded nothing and when Lask moved forward the visitors were turned for the first time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae49a93bb729c6e5fa49aa374e8f987e842786bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae49a93bb729c6e5fa49aa374e8f987e842786bc/0_166_3751_2251/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Odion Ighalo opens the scoring in the first half.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Odion Ighalo opens the scoring in the first half.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Uefa/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Klauss sprinted in behind Harry Maguire along the right and went down but Artur Dias, the referee, ignored the penalty shouts. Despite this, United were in control. A quick move that featured Brandon Williams to Ighalo down the right had the latter\u2019s cross mis-hit by Juan Mata. Fernandes collected and fed Luke Shaw and when he put the ball in this time Mata drew a corner. Fernandes took it but Scott McTominay could not score with his header.</p> <p>United were warming up. The faster passing play that Fernandes has ignited since his winter transfer was behind a Daniel James snapshot that the goalkeeper, Alexander Schlager, saved well to his left. When Ighalo was signed on loan in January there was derision in some quarters. These naysayers had already been silenced by his three goals but the fourth suggested his arrival may prove a minor masterstroke: the ball arrived on the edge of the area at pace but following a mesmerising juggle he hammered the ball in off the bar to leave Schlager with no chance.</p> <p>\u201cHe had three touches and the fourth was the finish,\u201d his manager said. \u201cAll those touches were high-quality, but he had to make them to give himself the space and the strike is on the half volley, great timing. No one would have saved that one.\u201d</p> <p>While two over-enthusiastic United fans were ejected after breaking into the stadium, the home support nearly had an equaliser to cheer when the ball broke to Dominik Frieser near Sergio Romero\u2019s goal. The forward\u2019s attempt looked to be heading in before Eric Bailly blocked.</p> <p>The half closed with United still in the ascendancy. Another pinpoint Fernandes corner deserved a better header from Maguire. But Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s half-time chat seemed simple: telling his side to sharpen up in front of goal to make the contest comfortable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/mar/12/rangers-v-bayer-leverkusen-europa-league-last-16-live\">Rangers v Bayer Leverkusen: Europa League, last 16 \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>First up was a Lask free-kick, though, after Shaw was booked for felling Dominik Reiter. Peter Michorl took it but United\u2019s wall did its job. Val\u00e9rien Isma\u00ebl\u2019s team pressed, but United were able to roll the ball around until Shaw was in position down the left. He hit Mata but the No 8\u2019s first-time effort sailed over.</p> <p>A dimension Ighalo offers is the outlet ball and how he killed a high pass and twisted before spraying possession wide to Williams was a fine illustration. Next he turned creator, helping James to break a six-month drought by finding the Welshman, the latter\u2019s long-range strike his fourth of the season. Moments later, Ighalo might have scored again but hit the right-hand post, Fernandes\u2019s vision again releasing the striker.</p> <p>In the closing stages United added three more. With eight minutes left Mata finished clinically after Fred played him in with a glorious through-ball. In added time Tahith Chong put in Mason Greenwood, who smashed in via both posts, and there was still time for a fifth as Andreas Pereira\u2019s speculative long-range effort was fluffed in by Schlager to complete a satisfying night in Austria\u2019s third city.</p> <p>What happens next for United in the Europa League is unclear. This may be their last action for a while.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Prof </strong><strong>Deenan Pillay</strong><strong>, professor of virology, </strong><strong>University College London</strong></p> <p>The ways these measures are developed and issued will be balancing the urgency of trying to flatten the curve of the peak versus activities that are sustainable and realistic. The purpose of staying at home for seven days if you have a new continuous cough or a high temperature is to blunt the number of people contributing to ongoing transmission, and that is a very important step. It will help reduce deaths, but also reduce the number of people who are admitted to hospital and intensive care. From the situation in Italy, we can see that intensive care is one of the services that will soon become overwhelmed.</p> <p>It\u2019s very sensible to try to limit the chances of infection in those at high risk of needing intensive care. We can also see around the world that cruise ships are more likely to have older people, but also that the cruise ship environment is an ideal chance for infections to circulate widely.</p> <p>Banning overseas school trips is a difficult one, but remember that any trips involve groups of people going to airports, going on boats and coaches, and living together, and since this virus is ubiquitous now, anything like that is likely to increase acquisition. We know that children are less likely to get severe disease from coronavirus, but they nevertheless are likely, if they do get infection, to spread it to others. It\u2019s a sensible measure before closing the schools.</p> <p>Many organisations and businesses are already implementing working from home and reducing meetings. I\u2019m surprised there\u2019s not an emphasis on that, it would be good for government policy to reflect it.</p> <p>I\u2019m very pleased there isn\u2019t the sort of reaction we\u2019ve seen in the US to close borders. This infection is now circulating in the UK and it\u2019s important that, wherever those infections come from, there\u2019s an understanding that we\u2019re responsible for dealing with all of them and avoid the xenophobia that has emerged and that would be perpetuated by an insular approach.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26c0a16f5c46c255fcc7bb42d19dd3aeeda08762\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26c0a16f5c46c255fcc7bb42d19dd3aeeda08762/0_0_3710_2226/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A group of primary school children have a picnic in St James\u2019s Park, London.

Some might have felt that their employers would not allow this, and the government mandate gives them license to do the sensible thing and stay home just in case.</p> <p>Not closing schools seems understandable to me. Children will be the least likely to be affected, and therefore the least likely to be shedding virus, which is directly proportional to more serious symptoms. In contrast, if you close schools you\u2019re keeping a very large number of parents away from work \u2013 as long as it is deemed feasible to keep workplaces open, it\u2019s probably better not to harm the economy further in this way.</p> <p>I was surprised and disappointed to see nothing on testing. The people with suggestive symptoms should be tested during their self-isolation, so that we can maintain more reliable data about the actual real-time reach and spread of this epidemic, and so that crucially their immediate contacts can be traced. What is government doing on increasing our supply of testing kits and the workforce to go out and test people at their homes? I was disappointed to hear no update on that.</p> <p>People over 70 with pre-existing conditions could get into trouble in crowded settings far beyond cruise ships. I think the advice could have been more broadly reaching for this group of particularly vulnerable individuals. [Banning] international school trips feels very arbitrary to me. What about other forms of travel?</p> <p>Not banning major events now is the biggest disappointment and surprise for me. I think buy-in would be high anyway \u2013 many will already choose not to attend. The virus is clearly circulating in communities, and large gatherings in confined spaces could accelerate onward transmission.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df6d82731c454f25ba8b29cd33896f1448a65bb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df6d82731c454f25ba8b29cd33896f1448a65bb3/0_111_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"coronavirus testing procedure at the pathology labs, Leeds General Infirmary\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018What is government doing on increasing our supply of [coronavirus] testing kits and the workforce to go out and test people at their homes?\u2019 asks a cell biologist.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Prof Paul Hunter</strong><strong>, professor in medicine,</strong><strong> Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia</strong></p> <p>I was expecting there to be something a bit more rigorous. I can\u2019t see that any of these measures are going to have a big impact on the current situation.</p> <p>The guidance about self-isolating if you have any respiratory symptoms for a week is absolutely spot on. I\u2019m not sure how many people will actually follow that advice \u2013 we shall see. But even if people ignore the advice themselves, you can imagine that if they turn up to work, colleagues and bosses will be on their case and there will be increased peer pressure.</p> <p>Just telling elderly people to not go on cruises isn\u2019t enough to protect them. I would\u2019ve hoped we\u2019d be seeing more targeted advice for elderly and vulnerable citizens on what sort of things they should be thinking about. I think they\u2019ve been left out on a limb.</p> <p>The issue for me with not going on cruises would be not so you can protect yourself \u2013 it\u2019s because you could get quarantined for god knows how long. It\u2019s the same for the new advice on school trips: you don\u2019t want them going off and then travel bans come in and they\u2019re quarantined in a hotel. </p> <p>However, none of that is really going to affect transmission in the UK. I think at this point we are being perceived as lagging behind a lot of countries. And presumably other countries are basing their decisions on scientific information too.</p> <p>I would like to see a bit more about why they\u2019re not closing schools and banning large events. We do know, in general, that school holidays lead to a marked reduction of transmission in infections and at the end of school holidays, infection rates take off. </p> <p>I\u2019m sure it\u2019s based on good quality science. But we don\u2019t know what that science is. The science isn\u2019t being shared with us in a way that makes it easy for us to understand the logical basis for all of this.</p> <p>I would hope that more of the information and science that the government is relying on to make these decisions would be made available so we could interrogate it and see if it\u2019s valid. Unless that happens, there\u2019s a risk of losing the trust of the scientific community and the public.</p> <p>One of the biggest reassurances from my perspective is having Chris Whitty as chief medical officer. Of all the chief medical officers we\u2019ve had in the last few decades, he is the one with the best background to have coped with this.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d56280b5889f2bc9d86ae5a559a2b2dcad11d3d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d56280b5889f2bc9d86ae5a559a2b2dcad11d3d2/0_13_5356_3214/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hand sanitiser facilities at the Cheltenham Festival race meeting, a large event which went ahead this week despite coronavirus concerns.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hand sanitiser facilities at the Cheltenham Festival race meeting, a large event which went ahead this week despite coronavirus concerns.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Prof John Ashton</strong><strong>, former regional director of public health for north-west England</strong></p> <p>This is a kind of ragbag with no particular logic to it. The fact that they are now declaring we\u2019re moving into this second phase, as if it\u2019s some kind of planned event, is really meaningless. We need to mobilise the whole community response to this and they are behaving in a top-down way, in a half-hearted way, so it\u2019s neither one thing nor the other.</p> <p>They are issuing some semi-directive things but they are not really doing what we need to do, which is to mobilise and encourage communities, neighbourhoods, families to form their own plans for the next period in which the local situation will influence what happens \u2013 whether it\u2019s not going out to eat, or stopping sporting events. It will be determined by the data, which they should be sharing promptly and fully with everybody so that people can decide for their town, village, neighbourhood what they need to do.</p> <p>If everybody reduced the amount of mixing time that they\u2019ve got, that would help to slow things down. We should take this as an opportunity to develop home working. Universities don\u2019t need so much bricks and mortar because there\u2019s so much learning online.</p> <p>What we\u2019ve got is this cack-handed centralised country trying to run everything from London.

The news arrived in dramatic fashion on Wednesday night when the Utah Jazz and Oklahoma City Thunder\u2019s game was called off minutes before tip-off. One of Utah\u2019s star players, Rudy Gobert, is believed to have tested positive for Covid-19 before the start of the game, and on Thursday the Jazz announced a second player on the team, believed to be Donovan Mitchell, was also suffering from the virus.</p> <p>The NBA\u2019s suspension came as the season was heading towards the playoffs, which were due to start in April. The news was met with shock within the league, which has already suffered a tumultuous season. The league lost hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue from its most lucrative foreign market, China, after a fallout in October over the anti-government protests in Hong Kong.

The official number of confirmed cases is 596.<br></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson confirmed that the UK was now moving out of the \u201ccontain\u201d phase and into the \u201cdelay\u201d phase for dealing with the epidemic.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This is now not just to attempt to contain the disease as far as possible, but to delay its spread and thereby minimise the suffering. If we delay the peak even by a few weeks, then our NHS will be in a stronger state as the weather improves and fewer people suffer from normal respiratory diseases, more beds are available and we\u2019ll have more time for medical research. We can also act to stretch the peak of the disease over a longer period so that our society is better able to cope.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said that people with a fever or a new, persistent cough were now being asked to stay at home for seven days.</strong> He also said schools were being advised to cancel overseas trips, and the over-70s and the ill were being told to avoid cruises. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>From tomorrow, if you have coronavirus symptoms, however mild -- either a new continuous cough or a high temperature -- then you should stay at home for at least 7 days to protect others and help slow the spread of the disease. We advise all those over 70 and those with serious medical conditions against going on cruises and we advise against international school trips. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that at some point in the future the government would go further, and ask all family members to stay at home if someone was ill.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>At some point in the next few weeks we are likely to go further and if someone in a household has those symptoms then we will be asking everyone in that household will stay at home.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He also said that at some point in the future the elderly would be asked to stay away from places or people to avoid infection. He did not give details.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said at the moment he was not planning to ban sporting events, but he said this was being kept under review.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are considering the question of banning major public events such as sporting fixtures. And the scientific advice, as we\u2019ve said over the last couple of weeks, is that banning such events will have little effect on the spread but there\u2019s also the issue of the burden that such events can place on public services.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In a mild dig at Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister who is planning to cancel events with crowds of more than 500 people from next week and whose decision to announce the results of the Cobra meeting before Johnson angered some in No 10, Johnson said that Scotland might have a particular issue with the resilience of its emergency services. He implied that that was why the Scots needed a different policy. Vallance said cancelling sporting events could be counterproductive. He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>On average, one person infects two or three others.</p> \n   <p>You therefore have a very low probability of infecting a large number of people in a stadium and a rather higher probability of infecting people very close to you.</p> \n   <p>And that means that most of the transmission actually tends to take place with friends and colleagues and those in close environments - and not in the big environments.</p> \n   <p>Though it is true that any cancellation of things can have some effect, if you then get a displacement activity where you end up with everyone congregating somewhere else, you may actually perversely have an increased risk, particularly in an indoor environment.</p> \n   <p>So it doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t at some point make the decision from a resilience point but this is not a major way to tackle this epidemic.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson defended his decision not to introduce measures as draconian as those being introduced in some other other countries.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The measures that I have discussed today... staying at home if you think you have the symptoms, your whole household staying at home, looking after the elderly - making sure the elderly and vulnerable stay at home - these are the three most powerful defensive lines.</p> \n   <p>We think it\u2019s very important to maintain public trust and confidence in what we are doing, throughout this challenging time, always to be guided by the best possible scientific advice.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He and his advisers also argued that, if self-isolation measures were introduced too early, they would be ineffective - because people would ignore them at the point where they were most necessary.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Whitty said he thought the overall mortality rate from Covid-19 was around 1% or less.</strong> It was higher for older people, and people in the vulnerable group, and lower for others, he said. But he said he did not want to speculate on who many people might die from the illness because he said the scientists just did not know how many people are infected. He said, although an 80% infection rate was the government\u2019s top reasonable worst case scenario, nowhere in the world was currently coming close to an infection level like that.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Vallance said that the outbreak in the UK could be about four weeks behind the outbreak in Italy. </strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Vallance said the peak of the epidemic in the UK was \u201csomething like 10 to 14 weeks away\u201d.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s all from me for today.</p> \n  <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6a7aaf8f087df56e4c77e3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T18:21:06.369Z\">6.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Nigel Farage critique of Boris Johnson (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/12/trumps-travel-ban-wont-have-much-impact-on-spread-of-coronavirus-says-rishi-sunak-live-news?page=with:block-5e6a79788f08c2df6d278784#block-5e6a79788f08c2df6d278784\">6.08pm)</a> is still very much a minority view at Westminster.

But there\u2019s a catch, or rather two. First, if you look at day-to-day spending on public services per head, it is no higher than it was in 2009-10 (because the population has got bigger). And, second, if you take out health, which received a sizeable, long-term spending increase under Theresa May, real-terms spending on everything else is lower than at the end of the Labour government, both overall (7% lower) and per person (14% lower).</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be3d989cc63d9d4035285161238d9319379939ce\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be3d989cc63d9d4035285161238d9319379939ce/0_0_938_692/500.jpg\" alt=\"Real-terms public spending figures.\" width=\"500\" height=\"369\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Real-terms public spending figures.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IFS</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>But the IFS also says these figures are potentially misleading, for two reasons. First, they include the \u00a311bn a year that the UK will save because it won\u2019t have to make annual payments to the EU - but they do not take into account the \u00a37-8bn a year that the EU used to spend in the UK. And, second, they include an extra \u00a35.5bn a year that the government is spending because of changes to the rules on employer pension contributions. The IFS argues that taking out these figures allows for a more reliable comparison with the past, and on that basis it has produced a chart with adjusted figures (see below).</p> \n  <p>On this measure, day-to-day public spending in real terms will still be higher in 2024-25 than in 2009-10, but only 5% higher, not 9% higher. But day-to-day spending per person ends up being 4% lower in 2024-25 in real terms than in 2009-10, overall spending excluding health is 12% lower, and spending per person excluding health is 19% lower.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b7e823ec34da069481ab0d7c1aeb734b08b2e24\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b7e823ec34da069481ab0d7c1aeb734b08b2e24/0_0_946_703/500.jpg\" alt=\"Real-terms public spending figures - adjusted\" width=\"500\" height=\"372\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Real-terms public spending figures - adjusted</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IFS</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6a58268f087df56e4c75e6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T15:42:49.500Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Sturgeon is now taking questions.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: What sort of gatherings do you want to cancel?</em></p> \n  <p>Ones that put pressure on emergency services, she says.

He explained:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The OBR\u2019s economic forecasts are a little more positive than the Bank\u2019s, but they are still very weak even before factoring in possible longer term effects from the coronavirus. Projected growth rates averaging barely over one and a half per cent a year for the next five years are feeble and indicative of an economy that is not in a robust position for coping with shocks like the coronavirus. The OBR continues to assume an orderly move to a free trade agreement with the EU. Anything less orderly, or a failure to achieve such an agreement, would weaken an already weak economy even further.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that if coronavirus had a long-term impact on the economy, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, would have to revise his strategy.</strong> Johnson said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Only time will tell whether any of the numbers in this budget will have meaning once the economic effects of coronavirus become fully evident ...</p> \n   <p>If the long-term path of the economy is affected then [Sunak] will also need to reassess much more of his fiscal strategy when he returns to the despatch box in the autumn.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the plans for current spending were \u201cnothing like as generous as they appear\u201d. </strong>He explained:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Average annual increases of 2.8% sound substantial. Take account of the need to replace EU funding, and factor in planned increases for health, schools, defence and overseas aid, and there is relatively little here for other departments. If this spending envelope is stuck to there are plenty of public services which will not be enjoying much in the way of spending increases over the next few years.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said overall spending is due to rise by 9% in real terms between 2019-20 and 2023-24, \u201clargely paid for by extra borrowing\u201d.</strong> He said public spending would stabilise at around 41% of national income, \u201cabove its pre-crisis level and bigger than at any point between the mid 1980s and the start of the financial crisis\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>But he said current spending per head for most public services would remain well below 2010-11 levels in 2024-25. </strong>He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>While austerity is clearly at an end in the sense that spending is rising, spending levels in many areas are set to remain well below 2010 levels for a long time to come.

Given that welfare support is targeted at lower-income households, and that the 2015 package of welfare cuts was so substantial (including the benefits freeze and two-child limit), the average losses for poorer households are very large. For example, the second decile will ultimately be \u00a32,900 a year worse off (on average) than if welfare policy had remained unchanged, with \u00a3900 of that still to come as a result of welfare policies still being rolled out. </p> \n   <p>Welfare cuts have been somewhat offset (in aggregate) by tax cuts. Successive cuts to income tax, through increases in the personal allowance and higher-rate threshold, have been followed in this budget by an increase in the starting point for national insurance, as well as repeated fuel duty freezes. But these changes have been of most benefit \u2013 in cash terms \u2013 to the top half of the income distribution, though this has been tempered at the very top by tax increases targeted at the richest tenth of the population.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dce2e891de391d34268cb33e03c1bb28ecdf1b08\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dce2e891de391d34268cb33e03c1bb28ecdf1b08/0_0_649_510/500.jpg\" alt=\"Distributional impact analysis of tax and benefit changes since 2015.\" width=\"500\" height=\"393\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Distributional impact analysis of tax and benefit changes since 2015.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Resolution Foundation</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T13:26:24.243Z\">at 1.26pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6a33228f08c2df6d2783a6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/kate-proctor\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T13:05:35.612Z\">1.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>President Trump did not contact Boris Johnson directly before his decision to ban citizens from 26 EU countries from entering the US for the next 30 days, No 10 has said.

He was speaking during business questions, and responding to a question from the SNP MP <strong>Tommy Sheppard</strong> who said that it might be safer for MPs during the coronavirus outbreak to abandon their normal method of voting (queuing up in a smallish lobby while waiting to have their names ticketed off by a clerk) and to instead use the deferred division procedure (voting using a ballot paper). Rees-Mogg replied that he had taken a Public Health England official into a division lobby and been told that the lobbies were \u201cnot a high risk\u201d.

She explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Mass gatherings, football matches for example, they need to be policed, they need to have emergency medical ambulance cover.</p> \n   <p>We are going into a period where our emergency services, our NHS in particular, will be under significant challenge and significant pressure, we may see all of our workforces affected by high absentee rates because of sickness, so there\u2019s a wider issue here about whether cancelling those kind of events is the right thing to do to reduce pressure on our front-line emergency workers.</p> \n   <p>From a wider resilience point of view, then I think there is a big question mark over whether large-scale events like that, whether it is sensible to allow them to proceed at the moment.</p> \n   <p>We\u2019re looking very carefully right now at whether large-scale events, whether it would be right and sensible given the situation we are facing right now to allow them to go ahead.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The UK government may announce a move towards new \u201csocial distancing measures\u201d after a Cobra emergency committee meeting on coronavirus being chaired by Boris Johnson this afternoon.

He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The US is still deciding the details of what exactly that means, but you are right. As I talked about yesterday, there will be an impact on the demand side of our economy as people are unable to spend in the way they normally would and travel, but it also affects the supply chains for businesses and that impacts the supply side of our economy.</p> \n   <p>As those supply chains are disrupted, the productive capacity of our economy will shrink for a period of time.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He dismissed claims that his spending plans were irresponsible. </strong>He said: </li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I make absolutely no apology for responding in the short term in scale to the immediate threat that we face from coronavirus.</p> \n   <p>I think that\u2019s the right thing to do for the economy. We need to help businesses have a bridge to get to the other side.</p> \n   <p>In the medium term, as you will see from the figures, there is actually responsible economic management and it\u2019s because we\u2019ve had responsible economic management for several years that I\u2019m able to stand here in a strong position to say that we will do whatever it takes to get through this.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that his measures were compatible with the fiscal rules set out in the Conservative manifesto.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He laughed off suggestions that he had delivered a Gordon Brown budget, or a Labour budget</strong>. When LBC\u2019s Nick Ferrari put this to him, Sunak laughed, and said he would let others make that judgment.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He suggested that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s resignation as Labour leader was holding up the announcement of plans for reform of social care. </strong>When asked about the absence of social care from the budget, he said that Matt Hancock, the health secretary, wrote to MPs last week <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/health-and-care/news/110410/matt-hancock-kicks-cross-party-talks-social-care-crisis-letter\">proposing cross-party talks starting in May.</a> When it was put to him that the government was taking a long time, particularly since Boris Johnson claimed to have a plan for social care last summer, Sunak replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is no permanent leader of the opposition at the moment. They\u2019re having a leadership contest, so we can\u2019 formally start that process until they have one.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Sunak defended his decision not to extend sick pay to cover the low-paid and the self-employed.</strong> In the budget he said that people in these categories would instead find it easier to claim benefits as a result of rules being relaxed during the coronavirus outbreak. This morning he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>For those that don\u2019t [have access to statutory sick pay] we\u2019ve strengthened the working of our welfare system so that it works quicker, more responsibly and more generously for those people.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He also claimed that around half of workers who needed to take time off would get more than statutory sick pay because their employers offered more generous arrangements.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He sidestepped a question about whether he and his family would be able to live on \u00a390 a week.</strong> Statutory sick pay is worth \u00a394.25 per week. Asked whether that was enough to live on, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have strengthened our safety net to make sure we have access to benefits easier, quicker, more generously, and also provided an extra \u00a3500m to local authorities to distribute to vulnerable people and their local communities if they need extra support. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When pressed on whether he could live on this himself, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This is a safety net. That is what it\u2019s there for, to provide people to fall back on. It\u2019s obviously not the same as your day-to-day life</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He defended his decision not to include nurseries in the list of companies that will qualify for a one-year exemption from business rates.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51843971\">The nursery sector has been horrified by the decision</a>. Asked why they were not included, Sunak said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Because what we\u2019ve done on business rates is target the sectors of the economy which are in the consumption side of the economy, which will see a very significant hit because of people\u2019s inability to spend. And what we wanted to do is make sure that they don\u2019t go out of business during that period of time.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He accepted that his plans involved making an assumption about the cost of borrowing remaining low, but it was a judgment he defended.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You have to make a judgment about the persistence of low interest rates, that\u2019s a judgment I have to make as chancellor.</p> \n   <p>The reality is these interest rates have stayed lower for longer than anyone expected and keep falling, and it\u2019s right that I as someone in charge of managing our public finances has a view on that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0562573b5aa4ed8b8417232293950b28bd3faf1\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0562573b5aa4ed8b8417232293950b28bd3faf1/0_147_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rishi Sunak visiting a building project at Leeds station this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rishi Sunak visiting a building project at Leeds station this morning.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T10:56:06.488Z\">at 10.56am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6a00d18f087df56e4c7207\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T09:29:35.590Z\">9.29am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Stock markets around the wall are down following President Trump\u2019s travel ban announcement.

We are all learning more about the seriousness of this situation and hopefully people can continue to educate themselves and realize that they need to behave responsibly both for their own health and for the well being of those around them. I appreciate the authorities in Oklahoma who were helpful with the testing process and everyone from the @utahjazz who have been so supportive.

I have gone through so many emotions since learning of my diagnosis\u2026mostly fear, anxiety, and embarrassment.  The first and most important thing is I would like to publicly apologize to the people that I may have endangered.  At the time, I had no idea I was even infected.  I was careless and make no excuse.  I hope my story serves as a warning and causes everyone to take this seriously.  I will do whatever I can to support using my experience as way to educate others and prevent the spread of this virus .  I am under great care and will fully recover.  Thank you again for all your support.  I encourage everyone to take all of the steps to stay safe and healthy.

  "<p>Coronavirus is the first major crisis Donald Trump has faced that is not of his own making. People who know what it is like to be in charge when disaster strikes have warned us this moment would come eventually \u2013 and we can now see why they were so terrified.</p> \n<p>Trump in a time of coronavirus is a lethal combination. Everything about the president \u2013 his reliance on his gut instincts in place of expertise, his overwhelming selfishness, and his unfailing tendency to lash out at others when things go wrong \u2013 make him the worst person imaginable to hold the world\u2019s most powerful job in the face of pandemic.</p> \n<p>Confronting the threat requires global cooperation, perhaps more than at any time since the second world war.

The EU mission in Washington only found out about it when journalists started calling.</p> \n<p>The president has dealt with coronavirus the same way he approached every other challenge in his administration, first trying denial \u2013 and when that failed, blaming outsiders.

It came as little surprise that his speech had been written by Stephen Miller, the author of the administration\u2019s cruellest anti-immigration policies.</p> \n<p>The declaration of a European travel ban was only the second time Trump has addressed the nation from behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. The first time was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/08/donald-trump-speech-tv-address-border-wall-oval-office\">to announce the building of a wall on the Mexican border</a>. The administration has made xenophobia its defining ethos.</p> \n<p>It can stir up passions and corral votes, but railing against foreigners is useless against a virus that is indifferent to ethnicity and nationality.</p> \n<p>Slamming the gates shut is also pointless in the face of a disease that already has taken hold within. Its incidence appears lower in the US than in much of Europe so far \u2013 but almost certainly because US has barely started testing.</p> \n<p>And the US is only shutting some of its gates. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/12/donald-trumps-eu-travel-ban-is-driven-by-politics-not-science-coronavirus&amp;sa=D&amp;source=hangouts&amp;ust=1584120160309000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGp78I9QE6o0JbAe5fmUfH6-l1Mvg\">The exclusion of the UK and non-Schengen countries like Ireland</a> from the ban makes no sense if stopping the spread of disease is really the aim. Contrary to Trump\u2019s claim, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/health-expert-brands-uks-coronavirus-response-pathetic\">UK is not doing a \u201cgreat job\u201d in containing coronavirus</a> compared with most of its European neighbours.</p> \n<p>It may or may not be a coincidence that Trump has golf resorts in the UK and Ireland. Given Trump\u2019s preoccupation with his investments throughout his time in office, it is as plausible an explanation as any for an otherwise pointless decision.</p> \n<p>On the one strategy known to be effective in curbing the pandemic \u2013 screening for the virus and organised social distancing \u2013 the US is far behind most of the countries it has now cut off.</p> \n<p>The production and distribution of diagnostic tests has been a fiasco. The initial test distributed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was flawed and had to be recalled. Production of new tests has been held back by a global shortage of a key component, reagents used to extract RNA from samples. Largely because of complacency at the top, the US was last in line putting its order in.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/coronavirus-us-healthcare-preparedness-guidelines\">Coronavirus: health experts concerned US hospitals are not prepared</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The same complacency has allowed the institutions that the US now most needs to wither and die.

This is one thing we really didn\u2019t want to go this way.\u201d</p> \n<p>Researchers in Belgium and the Netherlands drew on data from outbreaks in Singapore and Tianjin to work out the \u201cgeneration interval\u201d for Covid-19. The generation interval is the time between one person getting infected and them infecting another. The figure is valuable for estimating the speed at which an outbreak will unfold.</p> \n<p>The mean generation interval was 5.2 days in the Singapore cluster and 3.95 days in the China cluster, according to <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031815v1\">the analysis</a> which is under review at an infectious disease journal. The scientists went on to calculate what proportion of infections were likely spread from people who were still incubating the virus and had yet to develop symptoms.</p> \n<p>There are uncertainties in the figures because the scientists did not have precise information on who infected whom in the two clusters of disease. But even the lowest estimates show there was substantial transmission of coronavirus from people who had yet to fall ill.</p> \n<p>In the Singapore cluster, between 45% and 84% of infections appeared to come from people incubating the virus. In China, the figures ranged from 65% to as much as 87%.</p> \n<p>Tapiwa Ganyani, a researcher on the team, said the numbers suggest that isolating sick people would not be enough to quell the outbreak. \u201cIt is unlikely that these measures alone will suffice to control the Covid-19 epidemic,\u201d he said. \u201cAdditional measures, such as social distancing, are required.\u201d</p> \n<p>The finding confirms recent comments from Maria Van Kerkhove, head of the World Health Organization\u2019s emerging diseases and zoonoses unit, who said preliminary data showed patients shed more virus in the early stages of the disease, including when presymptomatic. A <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20030502v1\">separate study</a> that tracked nine patients in Germany found that levels of the virus might already be in decline when symptoms come on.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe number helps us estimate how likely certain kinds of public health interventions are to work,\u201d said Riley. \u201cIf you ask people to go home when they feel ill and they have infected half the people they are going to infect before they feel ill, then you know you are not going to get rid of those transmissions.\u201d But he said it was still important to isolate those with symptoms, even if it would not be enough to stop the outbreak.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/02/corona-carousel\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Ganyani stressed that the study looked at outbreaks where quarantine and other containment measures were already in place, which inflates the proportion of infections from presymptomatic people. \u201cIf control measures are less strict you would expect this estimate to be lower, but the number of secondary cases to be higher on average,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Rowland Kao, who studies infectious disease dynamics at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u201cOne of the factors that has distinguished this coronavirus pandemic from the Sars epidemic in 2003, is that Sars was infectious only after the development of clinical signs, which made it relatively easier to control. For the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/who-declares-coronavirus-pandemic\">current pandemic</a>, from very early on it was suspected that a substantial number of transmissions were arising before clinical signs appeared.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ddc4ba48-47b8-4b2b-91d2-081cd3e143d1\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3jpXAMwRSu4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWhat is important to know is that, in their analysis, isolation can play an important and possibly crucial role but needs to be supplemented by other measures,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p><em>Additional reporting by Hannah Devlin</em></p>",

  "<p>The 2012 Olympics happened so long ago, didn\u2019t they? It feels as if they took place in a different age, back in the golden days before Brexit cleaved the country in two and when toilet roll was still readily available.</p> <p>The stars of 2012 have also faded, something underlined by the new Comedy Central gameshow Gods of the Game, in which Sir Chris Hoy \u2013 titan of the velodrome, winner of more Olympic gold medals than any other Briton \u2013 races three members of the public across a medium-sized lake in a swan-shaped pedalo.</p> <p>This is the central premise: could a celebrated Olympian beat Joe Public at something a bit rubbish? So, not only does episode one contain the Hoy pedalo game, but it also makes Olympic gymnast Max Whitlock muck about on some monkey bars in a park, and gold medal-winning hockey player Sam Quek go tenpin bowling.</p> <p>Overseeing this weird dystopia is Sir Bradley Wiggins, or to be more accurate \u2013 and I promise I\u2019m not making this up \u2013 a giant Wiggins sitting atop a throne in a vast arena wearing a breastplate fitted with the most artificial-looking abs since Darryn Lyons took his shirt off on Celebrity Big Brother in 2011. At no point during Gods of the Game does Wiggins ever look truly comfortable. This is a man whose reputation has been eroded by claims of doping (which he denies), and who last year said that television was \u201cquite vacuous\u201d and \u201cmost people on TV are c***s\u201d. Watching him, you get the feeling that the cameras started rolling at the exact moment he realised what he was getting himself into.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2808c62d00da8e18bdb59735ac9380b2889b83d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2808c62d00da8e18bdb59735ac9380b2889b83d6/0_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Titan of the velodrome, but not of the telly \u2026 Sir Chris Hoy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Titan of the velodrome, but not of the telly \u2026 Sir Chris Hoy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Comedy Central</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The challenges, meanwhile, have a certain veneer of charm. They\u2019re so unadorned and shonky you may as well be watching a bunch of kids muck about in a playground. It\u2019s the same feeling you got the first time you watched Takeshi\u2019s Castle and recoiled at how dirty the water looked. When it works \u2013 when you see the vestiges of Hoy\u2019s Olympic ambition flare up when it looks for a moment as if he might lose his pedalo race \u2013 it\u2019s quite entertaining.</p> <p>But when it doesn\u2019t, and you have to spend several minutes watching people ineptly slap hockey balls into bowling pins, it can really sap your energy. And this is a problem. Gods of the Game is shooting for high-concept absurdity, but for the most part it falls short and only manages to be slightly diverting.</p> <p>It\u2019s a weird thing to say about a deliberately ironic low-budget Comedy Central gameshow, but I was expecting more from Gods of the Game. Its production company Mad Monk is responsible for some genuine lunacy. Sky\u2019s Wild Things won the Rose d\u2019Or and had such elaborate production design that I\u2019m certain it inspired The Masked Singer. Seven years ago I called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/mar/20/my-little-princess-best-dating-show-ever\">My Little Princess</a> \u201cthe best dating show I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d. I loved Banzai so much that I once spent a full summer unsuccessfully trying to get a job on it.</p> <p>These are the delirious heights these producers can hit, and the ones it was presumably hoping to hit with Gods of the Game. And yet something about it feels a little flat. If the Olympics were about striving for brilliance and achieving it, then Gods of the Game is about aiming for mediocrity and not quite making it. Which, in fairness, makes it as relevant to 2020 as the Olympics were to 2012.</p> <p><em>Gods of the Game is on Comedy Central tonight at 8.30pm.</em></p>",

  "<p>I was a remarkably strange, earnest, rule-abiding 10-year-old, so when we received a prank call to the house once, I didn\u2019t immediately realise it was happening. I don\u2019t think it hit me that it was a prank until I was deep into my 20s. I assumed that the voice on the other end of the phone asking, \u201cIs your washing machine running?\u201d was a representative of Hotpoint making a legitimate follow-up survey call after a vaguely recent purchase. I had to walk all the way downstairs to find my mum, who it turns out was in the bathroom, to ask her. I knocked on the door.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs the washing machine running?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?

I was utterly, thoroughly owned.</p> <p>Solidarity, then, with the Artist Formerly Known As Prince Harry, who, it emerged this week, was allegedly the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/prince-harry-tricked-into-megxit-revelations-by-fake-greta-thunberg\" title=\"\">victim of a prank phone call</a> from Russia\u2019s Ant and Dec equivalent, <a href=\"https://monitoring.bbc.co.uk/product/c1dofhaw\" title=\"\">Vovan and Lexus</a> (Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexey Stolyarov).

But whatever he has done or hasn\u2019t done is completely separate from me and my wife.\u201d He rounded the phone call out by saying: \u201cI was in the military for 10 years, so I\u2019m more normal than my family would like to believe.\u201d Which I think is pushing it a bit. There are literally four career paths available to former members of the British army \u2013 bullish Apprentice contestant; murderer; hidden homeless ignored by the government; and Nervous Man At Public Fireworks Display. Harry has about a week and a half to decide which of them he is going to take up.</p> <p>Read the headlines on Harry taking a phone call in good faith from a prominent climate activist and proceeding to have a mild conversation that was so watertight it could\u2019ve run on The One Show as a \u201cbit\u201d and you would see it as an enormous \u201cGotcha!\u201d That Harry \u2013 who dared to leave a royal family he was never going to be the king of simply because existence within its ancient structures is deeply horrible \u2013 was a spoilt brat who, seconds after announcing his exit, let the artifice slip and started blabbing family secrets to anyone who could reach his incredibly secure line at his safe house in Canada. Or you might see it as an agenda pushed by a media that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/08/prince-harry-lambasts-press-over-meghan-markle-coverage\" title=\"\">got chided by the same man</a> for aggressively pushing a witch-hunt against his wife: I don\u2019t know. The cynic in me, though \u2013 the one born the second he put that phone down as a child, who in that moment learned never to believe anything again \u2013 thinks this is all an act.</p> <p>Think about it. Harry has left the royal family to a mixed response (you fall into one of two camps: you either think leaving an ancient institution on mental health and limelight-pressure grounds into a life of guaranteed wealth and family bliss is a good idea, or you Extremely Care About Whether The Taxpayer Still Funds His Security Detail). He needs a PR win. What better way to woo the young, hip, always-online crowd than by speaking their language, of YouTube pranks, diplomatic \u201csee all sides\u201d opinions about world leaders, sincere wife-guy expressions of love and all the right noises about the climate crisis? Being pranked by Russians was arguably the best thing he could have done for his career at this point.</p> <p>My only fear is that this will result in the remaining members of the royal family trying to get in on the \u201cspeaking the language of online\u201d trend, in a bid to out-Harry Harry. William tries to do the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6wkZincU14\" title=\"\">Say So TikTok dance</a> in front of an assembly full of year 6 children, or something.

  "<p>When Sophie Hardcastle survived sexual violence at the hands of a friend at the age of 23, the first person she told asked her: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just scream?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor a while, I felt quite destroyed by it,\u201d says the Australian artist, novelist and former competitive surfer. Three years later, the traumatic experience forms the central premise of Hardcastle\u2019s new novel Below Deck. It is a story built on the screams of women.</p> <p>The book is narrated by Olivia, a smart but lonely university grad in her early 20s, who finds herself entranced by the sea when she goes on a sailing trip with two older friends, the wise and always kind Maggie and Mac. Four years down the track \u2013 and, spoilers ahead, halfway through the book \u2013 Oli is paid to help deliver a yacht from Noum\u00e9a to Auckland, and is the only woman in an all-male crew. Below deck, she is raped \u2013 and when she tells a fellow worker, he doesn\u2019t believe her. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t want it, why didn\u2019t you just scream?\u201d he asks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/harvey-weinstein-bewildered-as-women-he-abused-have-their-say\">Harvey Weinstein bewildered as women he abused have their say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWomen have always been considered bad luck at sea,\u201d says Hardcastle, 26, who is now based in the UK, where she was a Provost\u2019s scholar at the University of Oxford. \u201cWhen stuff goes wrong on a boat it goes really wrong really quickly.\u201d Indeed, a central tenent of Below Deck is the advice given by a friend of Hardcastle\u2019s mother. \u201cYou have to know who you are going to sea with and trust them with your life,\u201d she had said, \u201cbecause no one can hear you scream.\u201d</p> <p>That rings true for Oli. Not only is she raped, but when she is physically injured in an accident the crew refuse to turn back. And later, when she gets her period early, bleeding over the shared bunk, the men turf her out in a dinghy and drag her behind the boat like a rabid dog.</p> <p>Raised on the northern beaches of Sydney, Hardcastle published her first book in 2015: Running Like China, a memoir of living with bipolar disorder. Her second, the young adult novel Breathing Under Water, set in a<strong> </strong>fictional sleepy Australian surf town<strong>,</strong> came out a year later.</p> <p>Much of Below Deck was written during Hardcastle\u2019s time at Oxford studying English literature, and it is steeped in literary references as a result. Most symbolic is her nod towards the myth of Medusa, who is raped in the goddess Athena\u2019s temple by Poseidon, the god of the seas. To punish her for violating her sacrosanct space, Athena transforms Medusa into a monster with snake-infested hair.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of the very early stories of slut-shaming or victim-blaming,\u201d says Hardcastle. The scene of Oli being banished to the dingy is in a chapter titled Medusa, in a section titled Sea Monsters. The boat Oli is raped on is called Poseidon.</p> <p>Consent, too, is a key theme. At the age of 16, Hardcastle \u201chad an experience where I was unconscious and woke up to something. That was very clear-cut to me; it was very easy to say that was wrong.\u201d At the age of 23, however, Hardcastle voluntarily visited her friend\u2019s room and \u201cparticipated in some of it, but also said no to some of it \u2026 I wondered if that disqualified any claim for it to be sexual violence?\u201d</p> <p>As she writes in <a href=\"https://www.griffithreview.com/articles/where-the-voices-arent/\">an essay for the Griffith Review</a>: \u201cI pushed him off me. I pulled up my pants again. And again. And again. I wrote a message so clear, and still I felt him ignore it, turn the page. So then, how do I answer this question: <em>why didn\u2019t you </em>just scream?\u201d</p> <p>Oli, too, pushes her rapist off her and pulls up her trousers over and again. Yet, when it becomes clear what is happening, she begins to moan \u2013 as if mimicking the sounds of pleasure will make it better somehow, or at least make her feel she is in control. It doesn\u2019t. Oli, who like Hardcastle has synesthesia, experiences the world through colour. \u201cThe sound of no,\u201d Hardcastle writes, \u201cis sick yellow\u201d.</p> <p>For Hardcastle there should be no shades of grey when it comes to rape. It is black and white, right or wrong. She insists now: \u201cThis idea of a grey area exonerates perpetrators of sexual violence because it allows them to slip into this watery place where the boundaries aren\u2019t clear.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5d0ef69e2bc96e0510605058714bf1d7911f650c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d0ef69e2bc96e0510605058714bf1d7911f650c/0_0_2630_4000/658.jpg\" alt=\"Below Deck by Sophie Hardcastle is out now through Allen &amp; Unwin.\" width=\"658\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Below Deck by Sophie Hardcastle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allen &amp; Unwin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is some catharsis for Oli towards the end of the book, when she tells a group of supportive women what happened, naming it as rape. She also, finally, screams: \u201cI scream the way tectonic plates tear apart on the ocean floor, silt and sand and cracked rock \u2026 I roar.\u201d</p> <p>That scream for Oli matters. Hardcastle believes that even if women \u201cdon\u2019t scream in the way that the damsel in distress screams in movies, we do scream deep down. I like this idea that sound travels in waves and is rippling out through the sea and eventually all these stories will hit the surface.\u201d</p> <p>Hardcastle remains wary about naming her former friend, lest it \u201cdestroy their lives,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is interesting how I could write this book but still be so scared and thinking about how to protect this person.\u201d</p> <p>In a way, then, Below Deck is Hardcastle\u2019s own scream. \u201cAny sort of sexual abuse takes you out of yourself and you no longer have control of your body and have agency,\u201d she says. \u201cI weirdly feel I got my story back through writing fiction. That is enough for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Below Deck is out now through Allen &amp; Unwin</p>",

These 14-day isolation periods involve individuals or families staying within their homes, and not having physical contact with those outside. With the prospect of school and daycare closures, as well as workplaces shutting down or moving to remote working, many more families around the world face the prospect of precisely the kind of long days the Diener family is experiencing.</p> <p>But what can families expect and how can they survive not only the virus, but each other?</p> <p>For parents trying to work from home, their ability to do so will rely on various factors from the age of their children and the layout of their home to the nature of their work. The temperament of parents and kids will also play a role.</p> <p>Claire Amos, the principal of Albany senior high school in Auckland, has been self-isolating within the family home, away from her teenage children and husband, for nearly two weeks after a work trip to Italy. Amos devotes mornings to emails and Google Hangout meetings with senior staff and students, and was surprised at how productive she has been. \u201cYou can get jobs done really effectively in this state. A lot of the time you\u2019re busy being busy, rather than doing anything productive.\u201d</p> <p>Diener\u2019s wife works part-time from home for a local wine company, so her work hasn\u2019t been too disrupted. For Diener, used to training and playing basketball all day, the shift has been hard. He has tried to keep up some training but it\u2019s not the same. \u201cFor me, sitting at home is driving me a little crazy too,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m used to doing my job.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/coronavirus-charities-rally-to-help-older-people-in-self-isolation\">Coronavirus: charities rally to help older people in self-isolation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With routines disrupted and families thrown into close quarters, cabin fever is a real danger. It is exacerbated by predispositions and thought processes and can manifest, says Dr Carly Johnco, a clinical psychologist at Sydney\u2019s Macquarie University, as anxiety, extreme frustration, depression or low mood. The University of Melbourne psychology professor and parenting expert Prof Lea Waters AM says self-isolation can hit three critical components of mental health: our sense of autonomy, relatedness (a sense of being connected to others) and competency (feeling effective).</p> <p>Now for the good news. They\u2019ve all got tips on how to get through it.</p> <h2><strong>Begin on the same page</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI\u2019d suggest at the very start the family sit down and devise a family contract,\u201d Waters says. \u201cHave a discussion: what do you think will be the biggest challenges? What are the strengths that we each have as an individual family member that can help out?\u201d Discussing concerns and expectations about the quarantine, and what role each person can play to make it better, can be helpful, she says. \u201cForewarned is forearmed.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Be truthful</strong></h2> <p>It is important for parents to listen to and empathise with their children\u2019s fears, speak truthfully about the situation in an age-appropriate manner and put it into context, the experts say.</p> <p>\u201cHave conversations for facts and feelings,\u201d Waters says. Critical to allaying fears will also be allowing children a sense of control, such as over their personal hygiene.</p> <p>For adults too, keeping a sense of perspective and sourcing information and advice from credible sources will help stave off anxiety. Amos says it\u2019s important for people to be open about what they are experiencing, to reduce any possible stigma or embarrassment attached to self-isolation.</p> <h2><strong>Set up structure</strong></h2> <p>Maintaining a routine will be important but it need not be strict. \u201cRoutines are always helpful for people to see an endpoint,\u201d Waters says.</p> <p>Amos says routine has been critical to not going \u201cbonkers\u201d.

It could include working from home, school assignments or setting sights on long-avoided chores, repairs or tasks. Waters suggests encouraging kids to keep a \u201ccorona journal\u201d, in which they can document their experience. Amos has altered a jacket she had been meaning to work on for months, and laughs that her wardrobe has never been so organised.</p> <p>\u201cThe other thing I\u2019ve been doing is indulging,\u201d Amos says. She has a mandatory tea in the backyard sunshine. Johnco says it is important to make time for \u201cactivities that just make you feel good\u201d.</p> <p>Families should consider things they can do together \u2013 like planning for a movie night, taking on a large project such as building something together, or even rearranging the furniture.</p> <h2><strong>Give each other space</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1ce36c36f11035f5de41c21443e9575b9dd32fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1ce36c36f11035f5de41c21443e9575b9dd32fb/0_0_1753_1372/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A teenage girl reading an e-book in a corner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"783\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Respecting time alone is important in close quarters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: praetorianphoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cTry to think of things you can do by yourself and as a family,\u201d Johnco says. \u201cIt can be hard for families who are used to all going off to their own activities being forced into this intense time.

This bean bag with a headset is our chill-out corner.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>While respecting time alone is important, it could also be a time for creating or reconnecting with family rituals, she says. This might be as simple as a proper sit-down family meal, perhaps with a new recipe the kids have been involved in preparing.</p> <h2><strong>Stay in touch</strong></h2> <p>Another critical component of good mental state is feeling connected to others. This time, technology is our friend. Connecting and making time for friends on social media or over the phone will be critical for adults. Also important, says Johnco, is \u201creciprocal social support\u201d \u2013 reaching out to others to make sure they are OK.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/disease-dodging-worried-wealthy-jet-off-to-disaster-bunkers\">Super-rich jet off to disaster bunkers amid coronavirus outbreak</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Children are used to highly social environments and will also need to connect with friends. Older children, Waters says, could create themes on Instagram or Snapchat where they can share their experiences and tips with friends. With younger children it might be scheduling in some video calls with friends and family.</p> <h2><strong>Learn from the experience</strong></h2> <p>Diener says his kids have been great during their isolation, and have accepted their new routine.

  "<h2><strong>THE DETHRONING</strong></h2> <p>If there\u2019s one thing The Fiver likes, even more than finding a stray pork scratching under its desk, it\u2019s proper football. You know, proper football. Proper football! And there\u2019s nothing more proper in football than doing the properest thing of all, which is properly putting the ball in the net in order to declare yourselves the proper winners. And The Fiver is fairly sure Atl\u00e9tico Madrid did that three times on Wednesday night \u2013 it counted a well-executed move after Adri\u00e1n\u2019s error, a sweet finish and then a clinical breakaway \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/11/liverpool-atlletico-madrid-champions-league-last-16-second-leg-match-report\">thus scored three proper goals</a> to Liverpool\u2019s two proper goals. Did they deserve it? That depends on what matters to you. Did they win? That depends on the thing that matters the most, objectively, so yes they did.</p> <p>Liverpool only have a runaway league title tilt to make sure of now \u2013 wider events permitting \u2013 and perhaps that fed into J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s somewhat uncharitable reaction. \u201cWhen I see players like Koke, Sa\u00fal, [Marcos] Llorente, they could play proper football and not stand in their own half and play counterattacking football,\u201d he wailed. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel right tonight. I realise I\u2019m a really, really bad loser.\u201d At least he was up to scratch on the self-awareness front. But presumably he missed the fact that those massed ranks inside Liverpool\u2019s half did not prevent them from putting in 35 shots \u2013 and, it must be said, playing very well indeed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/mar/12/atletico-complete-anfield-heist-as-klopp-runs-out-of-miracle-nights\">for the majority of the game</a> \u2013 with only slack finishing and good goalkeeping from Jan Oblak denying them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/mar/12/atletico-complete-anfield-heist-as-klopp-runs-out-of-miracle-nights\">Atl\u00e9tico pull off Anfield heist as Klopp runs out of miracle nights | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Atl\u00e9tico might be good at our definition of proper football but they can\u2019t be much cop at proper anti-football, which The Fiver always thought amounted to throwing a blanket over the thing with a few <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MundialMag/status/1238001828689858560\">Emmanuel Adebayor-style kung-fu kicks</a> thrown in. But then there was something odd in the water all night and it clearly got to Diego Simeone, usually pugnacious to a fault, when he modestly offered up the idea that Liverpool had been unlucky to be denied the extra 30 minutes Atl\u00e9tico had received to score a few proper football away goals. It is a kink in the system for sure but, look, they\u2019ll pull through.</p> <p>Perhaps <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/12/adrian-not-to-blame-says-jurgen-klopp-liverpool-champions-league-exit\">what upset Klopp the most</a> is that, after two season finales that have built up to a crescendo, this one \u2013 coronavirus or no coronavirus \u2013 looks like fizzling out in a slightly odd way. Liverpool are brilliant and will win the league: nobody is about to argue with that. But the high-adrenaline Anfield days and nights that really get the old place going \u2013 the ones where miracles are made and the rest of the world can do one \u2013 will have to wait for a while now, and the Klopp era had brought back a heady diet of those. In the end, though, Liverpool could field 11 Adri\u00e1ns and still parade the Premier League trophy in front of their fans \u2013 or at least the seats they\u2019ve purchased \u2013 before the season\u2019s end. They\u2019ll have done enough to win and that, in the end, is what proper football looks like.

  "<p>Social media companies should be forced to pre-screen all uploaded material to help law enforcement agencies cope with the \u201cexplosion\u201d in online child sexual abuse in the UK, a critical report says.</p> <p>The UK is identified as the third-biggest consumer in the world of the livestreaming of abuse in the 114-page study by the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA).</p> <p>Published at the end of the inquiry\u2019s hearings into internet-facilitated exploitation, the report says social media companies appear motivated to \u201cavoid reputational damage\u201d rather than prioritising protection of victims.</p> <p>It calls for the industry to be legally required to pre-screen all uploaded material and adopt more stringent age-verification techniques for users.</p> <p>End-to-end encryption of messages will make it far more difficult for the police to prevent and detect online abuse, the report warns, adding \u201cregulation of the internet industry is now required\u201d.</p> <p>While enforcement efforts have reduced the global proportion of child sexual imagery on UK websites, the report notes, that has not hampered ease of access. Indecent photographs of children can still be reached \u201cfrom common search engines in only three clicks\u201d.</p> <p>Chief constable Simon Bailey, the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council lead for child protection and abuse, has described the UK as \u201cthe third greatest consumer in the world of the live streaming of abuse\u201d.</p> <p>Since 2016, as many as 450 people a month are being arrested in the UK for abuse-related offences. \u201cDespite technological advances to detect and prevent online child sexual abuse,\u201d the study says, \u201claw enforcement is struggling to keep up.\u201d</p> <p>As many as half a million men may have watched indecent images of children online, it is believed.</p> <p>The IICSA is scathing in its criticism of social media companies, finding that \u201cresponses appeared reactive rather than proactive; action seemed driven by a desire to avoid reputational damage rather than to prioritise protection of children\u201d.</p> <p>It added: \u201cWe are unconvinced that internet companies fully understand the scale of the problem of livestreaming on their platforms such that they can properly assess whether they employ sufficient numbers of moderators to detect such offending.\u201d</p> <p>They need to ensure \u201cthere are sufficient numbers of human moderators with a specific focus on online child sexual abuse and exploitation\u201d, the report states. \u201cThe value of human moderation is evident from the success achieved by the social network Yubo, whose moderators interrupt livestreams to tell underage users to put their clothes on.\u201d</p> <p>Online grooming appears to be increasing, with up to 10 grooming offences a day, according to research by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC). \u201cFacebook, Instagram and Snapchat are frequently named as the most common platforms where grooming takes place,\u201d the report says.</p> <p>The risks have become more widespread because the majority of UK children own a smartphone from around the time they start secondary school. \u201cAlthough industry companies either prohibit or discourage children under 13 years old from accessing their platforms or services, the age verification process can be often easily subverted \u2013 simply by inputting a false date of birth,\u201d the IICSA says.</p> <p>\u201cChildren aged under 13 years old need additional protection. The industry must do more than rely on children to supply their true age when signing up to a platform. There must be better means of ensuring compliance with the current age restrictions.</p> <p>\u201cThe Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) frequently encounters images of livestreams which involve children from western backgrounds, the majority of whom are girls aged between seven and 13 years old.\u201d</p> <p>The sums paid to watch \u2013 and in some cases direct \u2013 the abuse are trivial. Sometimes it costs little more than a pound. The IWF has helped reduce illegal content on UK websites.</p> <p>In one of its main recommendations, the report states: \u201cThe government should introduce legislation requiring providers of online services and social media platforms to implement more stringent age verification techniques on all relevant devices.\u201d</p> <p>From September this year, schools will have to include compulsory education in both primary and secondary schools that will help teach children about the need to stay safe online.</p> <p>Prof Alexis Jay, the chair of the inquiry, said: \u201cThe serious threat of child sexual abuse facilitated by the internet is an urgent problem which cannot be overstated.</p> <p>\u201cDespite industry advances in technology to detect and combat online facilitated abuse, the risk of immeasurable harm to children and their families shows no sign of diminishing.</p> <p>\u201cInternet companies, law enforcement and government [should] implement vital measures to prioritise the protection of children and prevent abuse facilitated online.\u201d</p> <p>The report makes four recommendations for action the government should take to tackle online abuse:</p> <ul> <li><p>Requiring industry to pre\u2010screen material before it is uploaded to the internet to prevent access to known indecent images of children.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Pressing the WeProtect global alliance to take more action internationally to ensure countries hosting indecent images of children implement legislation and procedures to prevent access.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Introducing legislation requiring providers of online services and social media platforms to implement more stringent age verification techniques on devices.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Publishing, without further delay, the interim code of practice in respect of child sexual abuse and exploitation as proposed by the online harms white paper<em> </em>(published April 2019).</p></li> </ul> <p>The IWF, a UK-based charity responsible for finding and removing child sexual abuse material online, is a core participant in the inquiry.</p> <p>Responding to the report, Susie Hargreaves, the IWF\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThere is no longer any reason not to be decisive on taking action against the predators who exploit and abuse children online. This report makes it abundantly clear there is no room for excuses. The internet industry and the government need to step up and tackle this head on.\u201d</p> <p>Andy Burrows of the NSPCC, said: \u201cThis report is a damning indictment of big tech\u2019s failure to take seriously their duty to protect young people from child abuse, which has been facilitated on their platforms on a massive scale.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why the UK must lead the way with world-leading regulation that forces industry to acknowledge the inconvenient truth that they are putting children at risk.\u201d</p>",

Back to the Future (1985)</h2> <p>The Freudian themes might make it less comforting than other films here, but Marty McFly\u2019s time-travel adventures in the small-town America of his parents\u2019 youth is always reassuring.</p> <h2>19.

A morality tale that is weirdly calming and pacifying.</p> <h2>18.

Dreamgirls (2006)</h2> <p>Jamie Foxx, Beyonc\u00e9, Jennifer Hudson and Danny Glover in this outrageously calorific double-helping of music and romance, all about the Detroit music scene from the 60s and 70s.</p> <h2>15. Love &amp; Basketball (2000)</h2> <p>Here to prove that sports movies can be as comforting as romances, and that they can moreover be romances, is Gina Prince-Bythewood\u2019s Love &amp; Basketball. Omar Epps and Sanaa Lathan star as the boy and girl next door who are both fiercely good at basketball, and pretty competitive, and perhaps not yet ready to confess how into each other they are. It\u2019s a very seductive love story with some sharp commentary on sexism on the basketball court.</p> <h2>14. Jupiter Ascending (2015)</h2> <p>This supremely wacky and world-historically daft sci-fi extravaganza is just what you need to cheer you up, featuring as it does an outrageous scene-stealing turn from Eddie Redmayne, playing the scheming space-lord Balem, an epicene pharaoh of intergalactic evilness. He completely upstages the film\u2019s notional leads Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis who encounter the vampirically arrogant alien clan \u2013 led by Redmayne. It really is wildly silly but very funny.</p> <h2>13. Mary Poppins (1964)</h2> <p>When you want cinema itself to be your nanny, dispensing wisdom and comfort, here is the Julie Andrews classic, cheering you up, spit-spot.</p> <h2>12. Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off (1986)</h2> <p>A wonderfully comforting movie that celebrates the world of idling, skiving, goofing off, and what the French flaneurs called \u201c<a href=\"https://hybridflaneur.wordpress.com/2015/03/05/the-metaphor-in-flaneur-botanizing/\" title=\"\">botanising on the asphalt</a>\u201d. Matthew Broderick plays a high-school kid from Chicago\u2019s North Shore called Ferris Bueller who fakes an illness so he can award himself a personal day in the city with his girlfriend and his best friend, who will be bringing his dad\u2019s treasured Ferrari. The movie bops around the city from joyous set-piece to joyous set-piece and some words from Ferris about how life goes by so fast that you have to make sure you appreciate it.</p> <h2>11. Clueless (1995)</h2> <p>The greatest Jane Austen adaptation in film history is also as richly comforting as drinking a mug of milky tea while curled up on the couch, eating a family-sized tub of Celebrations swathed in a cashmere slanket. Alicia Silverstone is glorious as Cher (the Emma of her day) who is happy, pretty and extremely well-meaning, with a great love of the mall, and an altruistic need to fix other people\u2019s love lives. She achieves a strange kind of intimacy with her stepbrother Josh, an earnest college kid home for the vacation, played by Paul Rudd, and they hang out in the kitchen or huddled up watching TV \u2013 and realise that have feelings for each other.</p> <h2>10. The Pursuit of Happyness (2006)</h2> <p>Unashamed and unabashed at all times, this is an industrial-strength Hollywood heartwarmer that lets you have the feelgood monosodium-glutamate right in your veins. Will Smith stars in this based-on-a-true-story of an ordinary guy who suffered heartbreak and homelessness as a single dad, and gets offered a once-in-a-lifetime shot out of poverty: an unpaid internship at a top financial firm. But he has to keep up appearances in front of all the other entitled Ivy Leaguers while covering up the fact that he is sleeping in a homeless shelter at night.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52x5HJ9H8DM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/52x5HJ9H8DM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>9. Paddington 2 (2017)</h2> <p>At a time when all of us feel like nothing more than self-isolating and eating marmalade direct from the jar, here is one of the most profoundly comforting comedies of recent times, which incidentally shows how a confident nation is happy about immigrants. Hugh Grant gives what many believe to be the finest performance of his career as the peevish, cravat-wearing actor Phoenix Buchanan who steals a precious pop-up book with clues to hidden treasure from Mr Gruber\u2019s shop \u2013 and frames Paddington for the crime. Despite doing jail time, the bear comes bouncing back.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzCx8bMMTOM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TzCx8bMMTOM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>8. Galaxy Quest (1999)</h2> <p>All together now: \u201cBy Grabthar\u2019s hammer, by the Sons of Warvan, you shall be avenged!\u201d Alan Rickman had a glorious role in this brilliant postmodern sci-fi comedy as Alexander Dane, the grumpy British thesp who had his moment of fame playing Dr Lazarus on a cancelled TV show called <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0177789/\" title=\"\">Galaxy Quest</a> and now, like the rest of the jaded cast (including Sigourney Weaver and Tim Allen), makes a living going round fan conventions, signing photos and reciting the catchphrases to the tragic nerdy fans. But then a deputation from outer space arrives believing the show to be a documentary history of what actually happened, and desperately needing our heroes\u2019 help. Galaxy Quest has one of the cleverest, funniest plot premises in film history, worked out to perfection.</p> <h2>7. The Princess Bride (1987)</h2> <p>William Goldman, who adapted this movie from his own novel, became famous for his screenwriting axiom: \u201cNobody knows anything.\u201d But we certainly know that this film is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/nov/09/favourite-film-princess-bride\" title=\"\">absolutely great</a>: sweet, charming, funny, with a dash of idealism and a genuine eccentricity that distinguishes it from regular Hollywood product. Cary Elwes plays the handsome farmhand who falls in love with a beautiful noblewoman played by Robin Wright. Their love is sabotaged by evil court plotters but the lovers find friendship with the passionate, hot-headed Spanish swordsman Montoya, played by Mandy Patinkin. Great to watch with all the family, or the grownups can savour it all on their own.</p> <h2>6. Notting Hill (1999)</h2> <p>This inspirationally glutinous fantasy from screenwriter Richard Curtis is about what would happen if an ordinary civilian bloke (and a Brit, to boot) fell for a super-glamorous Hollywood star, and she with him. The bloke is the tousle-haired stammerer Hugh Grant (making his second appearance on this list) and the star is Julia Roberts, who had what some of us believe to be her greatest career moment in Notting Hill, and the scene when she tearfully tells him that she\u2019s just a girl standing in front of a boy is a classic. Rhys Ifans found stardom as Hugh\u2019s appalling flatmate Spike who says: \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you a story that will make your balls shrink to the size of raisins\u201d, which incidentally is what happens to the male audience when the arrogant star, played by Alec Baldwin, dismisses poor Hugh from the hotel where he had been hoping to have sex with Julia. But it all ends happily.</p> <h2>5. Duck Soup (1933)</h2> <p>A brilliant and rather prescient satire on 1930s nationalism and indeed fascism, but also a hilarious comedy. The bizarre Ruritanian state of Freedonia, in deepest central Europe, is enduring a continuous and worsening economic crisis and forever on the verge of war with its equally belligerent neighbour Sylvania. But a rescue plan is at hand. A wealthy American widow (played in magnificent deadpan by Margaret Dumont) offers a multimillion dollar loan to Freedonia\u2019s coffers on condition that they install her close friend as president \u2013 and that is the free-thinking visionary and genius, Rufus T Firefly, played by Groucho Marx. Wisecracking Rufus soon causes mayhem in Freedonia\u2019s quasi-fascist staterooms. Is this the US\u2019s quasi-colonialism in action?</p> <h2>4. It\u2019s Complicated (2009)</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/11/nancy-meyers-focusing-on-my-movie-kitchens-is-sexist-director-its-complicated\" title=\"\">Nancy Meyers</a> is the Michelin-starred chef of cinematic comfort cuisine and here she serves up a richly flavoured dish of escapist storytelling, a veritable festival of gastro-lifestyle porn featuring very rich people who don\u2019t particularly regard themselves as rich. Meryl Streep is the divorced woman with grown-up kids who is now a \u201cchocolatier\u201d, of all the outrageously implausible things, running an upscale deli-cum-eaterie, although the actual work involved is minimal. Her roguish lawyer ex-husband, played by Alec Baldwin, broke her heart by running off with a hard-faced younger woman who is now failing to satisfy him on the life-affirming laughter front, so he starts having an affair with his ex-wife. You really do need to suspend your disbelief in this world of almost weightless freedom from work and ordinary money worries, but it is undeniably enjoyable and comforting in its weird way.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHfRyFyuDKM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sHfRyFyuDKM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>3. Waiting to Exhale (1995)</h2> <p>Waiting to Exhale is basically the equivalent to eating an entire Haagen Dazs tub of ice-cream while watching the greatest daytime soap opera of all time \u2013 and it is tremendously addictive. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine and Lela Rochon play four smart, successful women who are discontented with the men in their lives \u2013 and the way society somehow finds that a woman\u2019s inability to be in a relationship with a man makes their other accomplishments somehow second-rate. But these discontents are showcased in a horribly watchable world of nice clothes and nice cars. It also has a great male cast, including Wendell Pierce, later to be Bunk in The Wire and Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman on the London stage.</p> <h2>2. The Devil Wears Prada (2006)</h2> <p>Meryl Streep makes her second appearance on this list in this fashion comedy movie based on the Lauren Weisberger novel, reportedly inspired by the terrifying fashion empress Anna Wintour. It is a comedy, but without the sharp, angular edges of satire or bleakness that might endanger the comfort factor. New York City is replete with glamour and gorgeousness as the location for this aspirational story: Anne Hathaway is the callow literature graduate from the sticks who somehow flukes a job at the colossally prestigious fashion magazine Runway edited by Streep\u2019s terrifying Miranda Priestly, the boss from hell who enforces a Stockholm-Syndrome love on all her employees and on us, the audience. Stanley Tucci is wonderful as her long-serving, long-suffering senior executive and this was the film that launched the elegant Emily Blunt on the world, as the super-snobbish fashionista who is to be Hathaway\u2019s unwilling guide.</p> <h2>1. Titanic (1997)</h2> <p>There can surely be no doubt as to the No 1 slot. As Liam Neeson says in Love Actually: \u201cWe need Kate and we need Leo and we need them now.\u201d Cheesy it may be, but this film delivers weapons-grade feelgood \u2013 and, at well over three hours, it delivers an awful lot of it. Because, paradoxically, nothing says filmic comfort eating like screaming in terror and being plunged into the icy Atlantic ocean, resurfacing, discovering that for some reason the woman you are in love with somehow can\u2019t scooch up on her bit of driftwood to let you on, and then going back down again, with C\u00e9line Dion in the background singing that her heart will go on. Kate Winslet found her moment of global greatness as Rose, the young well-born passenger in first class who is unhappily engaged to creepy Billy Zane (fated not to cover himself with glory once the trouble starts). Rose finds that she has a distinct spark with Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s Jack who has won his third-class ticket in a poker game and thinks himself the luckiest young fellow in the world to have got on board for this exciting maiden voyage \u2013 especially when he feels that Rose is in love with him, and secretly gets to paint her in the nude. (That\u2019s her in the nude, not him.) It is amazing to think that just before this film was released, all the talk was about how it could be a disaster \u2013 how it was going to be like Lew Grade\u2019s Raise the Titanic; what a tyrannical monster Cameron was to his cast etc \u2013 but the film\u2019s instant rip-roaring success simply blew all this away. A film to lull you into a bovine stupor of wellbeing.</p>",
  "<p>The chef Michel Roux, who has died aged 78, was the younger half of the formidable partnership with his brother, Albert, that transformed the British restaurant scene in the late 1960s with their Michelin-starred restaurant Le Gavroche. Later, as sole director of the Waterside Inn, situated by an idyllic stretch of the Thames at Bray, Michel proved he was a chef\u2019s chef. His menu was a statement of the most classic form of French cooking \u2013 nouvelle cuisine had no part to play. Luxury ingredients, many mousses and forcemeats, the finest of p\u00e2tisserie, were integral. Michelin soon recognised the quality and this restaurant gained three stars, perhaps the highest professional accolade available, in 1985, which it has retained for longer than any outside France.</p> <p>From the outset, the Roux brothers\u2019 style of cooking embraced wholeheartedly the standards and practices of classic <em>haute cuisine</em> while offering a refined interpretation of a more homely <em>cuisine bourgeoise</em>. The rapid success of Le Gavroche from its star-studded opening on Lower Sloane Street, London, in 1967, attended by Ava Gardner, Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks Jr and a brace of marquesses, enabled the construction of a veritable empire, largely driven by the entrepreneurial spirit of Albert. The pair took in more restaurants, retail outlets, a restaurant supply business distributing produce shipped in from Paris markets, contract and outside catering, and production of vacuum-packed restaurant dishes. Michel was an integral part of this furious activity, while concentrating to an ever greater degree on the kitchen at the Waterside.</p> <p>Born in the small French town of Charolles, in southern Burgundy, Michel was the second son, and third child, of Henri Roux, a third-generation charcutier, and his wife, Germaine (nee Triger). After the second world war, the family moved to Saint-Mand\u00e9, a suburb to the east of Paris, and a charcuterie in Vincennes. However, Henri\u2019s enthusiasms for horse racing and leftwing politics (the children breakfasted beneath a large portrait of Stalin) were stronger than his love of the domestic hearth or making money, and his legacy to Michel was a lifelong aversion to socialism.</p> <p>Leaving school as soon as he was able, at the age of 14 Michel was apprenticed to a p\u00e2tissier in Belleville, Paris. This was a career path already followed by Albert, by this time a sous-chef at the British embassy in Paris. He suggested that Michel join him. After some months in the embassy p\u00e2tisserie, Michel was offered the post of commis chef a few doors down the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9 in the kitchens of C\u00e9cile de Rothschild, a member of the banking dynasty that owned the Ch\u00e2teau Lafite-Rothschild wine estate. With a break for military service in Algeria, Michel would stay as her chef for the next seven years.</p> <p>Albert had been working principally in London before and since leaving the embassy. It was his connections, through his employer, the racing trainer Major Peter Cazalet, that would provide the backing for the brothers\u2019 London venture, and Michel joined his brother there in the closing months of 1966. Sampling the capital\u2019s fanciest dining rooms, the pair saw room for root and branch improvement. In their view, British diners had faced a choice between a cynical simulacrum of international haute cuisine, available in grand hotels and long-established \u201cFrench\u201d restaurants, or the smoke-blackened kitchens of French peasant cooking, by enthusiastic amateurs who had abandoned their former profession in favour of chefs\u2019 whites. The Roux brothers proposed a return to first principles. </p> <p>Neither had spent time in a commercial kitchen prior to opening Le Gavroche: profit and loss, or indeed cost, came second to quality, correctness and doing a proper job. Michel spoke barely a word of English, and as he and his brother spent alternate weeks in the kitchen or front of house, it must have been a baptism of fire. Nevertheless, their endeavours were rewarded by a single star in Michelin\u2019s first British edition in 1974, then three in 1982, the year after the restaurant moved to Upper Brook Street, Mayfair.</p> <p>The first menu contained many of the signature dishes of later years, not least souffl\u00e9s suissesses (twice-baked cheese souffl\u00e9s with an immoderate quantity of cream), roast duck in two servings, and a wide choice of elaborate desserts (omelette souffl\u00e9 Rothschild first among them) to reflect Michel\u2019s expertise in p\u00e2tisserie. The restaurant also laid down from the get-go its aversion to diners in casual dress. One of the great sports of dining there was to watch the very rich and very loud be forced to don a spare old-school tie by an implacable receptionist.</p> <p>The early days, too, saw a resolute insistence on the use of French ingredients, some initially smuggled through customs by Albert\u2019s wife, Monique. The policy would give rise to regular shipments of vegetables and produce from the Paris market at Rungis, and eventually to a wholesale supply business serving London restaurants.</p> <p>While there was a certain reluctance on the part of the value-seeking British middle classes to take the restaurant to its heart, whether because of the prices, the apparent exclusivity or the style of waiting at table (at the Waterside Inn lowly commis waiters were forbidden to speak to customers), the sheer quality of cooking would soon convert them. It was then the springboard to an expansion of the brand, with a restaurant in the City, Le Poulbot, in 1969; by the law courts in the Old Bailey (the Brasserie Beno\u00eet, later Le Gamin, 1971); and the Waterside Inn the following year, where the brothers cooked turn and turn about until 1986, when they separated their business interests and Michel took sole charge.</p> <p>The Waterside has always been a seedbed of cooking talent and many of Michel\u2019s disciples went on to have distinguished careers of their own \u2013 Pierre Koffman, Christian Delteil and Mark Dodson among them. A new generation of Roux chefs also entered the kitchens. Michel ceded control of the restaurant to his son, Alain, in 2002 and took on the role of roving ambassador; by then Albert\u2019s son, Michel Jr, had taken over at Le Gavroche.</p> <p>Beyond the kitchen, Michel wrote more than a dozen books, sometimes in partnership with his brother, but it was always Michel who did the writing. These included New Classic Cuisine (1983) and At Home with the Roux Brothers (1988), which accompanied the television series of the same name. This last endeared them to countless British households who might have been too poor to afford their restaurants but who were willing to expend hours of effort, and gallons of cream, to achieve a domestic lookalike. The onscreen banter between the two chefs, and their almost comedic sense of double-act, earned them unexpected celebrity.</p> <p>In 2008 Michel moved to the Swiss resort of Crans-Montana, while keeping his house and vineyard near Saint-Tropez. True to form, he soon bought a restaurant near the ski slopes and installed a chef from the Waterside.</p> <p>Michel had been made a Meilleur Ouvrier de France in 1976, the gold medal for all working chefs. In 2002 he was made an honorary OBE and in 2004 a chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur.</p> <p>His first marriage, to Fran\u00e7oise Becquet in 1962, ended in divorce in 1979. He married Robyn Joyce in 1984. She died in 2017. He is survived by Christine, Francine and Alain, his children from his first marriage, and by his brother.</p> <p>\u2022 Michel Andr\u00e9 Roux, chef and restaurateur, born 19 April 1941; died 11 March 2020</p>",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>InsureandGo, owned by Mapfre of Spain, said on Thursday morning that customers who bought a policy after 11.59pm on 11 March will not be able to make any claim relating to the virus. Travellers who bought policies from all the firms prior to 11 March will be able to bring claims as before, the Association of British Insurers (ABI) said.</p> \n<p>The Post Office said it was monitoring the situation very closely and would update its travel alerts webpage with the latest information for policyholders.</p> \n<p>\u201cInsurance is designed to provide cover for unforeseen and unexpected events and is priced on this basis,\u201d said an Aviva spokeswoman. </p> \n<p>\u201cThe outbreak of the coronavirus means there is an increased likelihood of disruption to people\u2019s travel plans. We envisage that these decisions, affecting only Aviva\u2019s travel insurance new business, will be temporary actions.\u201d</p> \n<p>As the coronavirus outbreak has spiralled out of control, travellers and insurers have watched on with increasing horror. Travel insurance cancellation typically only kicks in when the Foreign Office advises against all but essential travel to a country.

So far children have made up a tiny minority of positive test results, but there hasn\u2019t been widespread random testing so it\u2019s not known whether they\u2019re getting it and showing mild or no symptoms (this is likely) and, if so, how infectious they are.

Closing schools also reduces groups of adults congregating. So most experts think that closing schools has a role, but that needs to be balanced with the disruption and potential for also taking health workers out of work as a result. Some are definitely of the opinion that the UK should follow moves by other European countries and be taking more extensive steps already.

There has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/japanese-woman-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-for-second-time\">one reported case</a> of a Japanese woman who tested positive, was given the all-clear and then tested positive again, suggesting that she had been re-infected. However, it is possible that one of these test results was inaccurate, and the broader picture, where we\u2019ve seen the outbreak brought under control in the Chinese city of Wuhan, suggests that people have short-term immunity. </p> <p>There are already four other coronaviruses circulating that cause about a quarter of common colds. For these viruses, people have immunity in the weeks or months after infection, but over time this begins to wane, meaning it is possible to catch the same strain again the following year. It is possible that Covid-19, which has more serious symptoms, also triggers a more enduring immune response, but we\u2019ll only know this for sure when scientists have had longer to test and re-test people. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T14:26:02.676Z\">at 2.26pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e6a2f398f087df56e4c73d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarahboseley\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T13:43:23.332Z\">1.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Q: How long will the coronavirus last?

As case numbers increase, the NHS will cut back on various types of surgery and treatment, to relieve some pressure on intensive care. NHS chiefs have said hospitals should aim to expand this capacity \u201cseveral-fold\u201d.

For in the course of nine minutes, Trump swiftly reverted to type. He described Covid-19 as a \u201cforeign virus\u201d, and took pains to point out that \u201ca large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travellers from Europe\u201d. His doctrine of \u201cAmerica first\u201d \u2013 a phrase he used once again \u2013 forever pits the US against the world, with its implication that America\u2019s purity is permanently under threat of contamination by alien hordes. Trump has used that imagery in the context of immigration for more than four years; it should hardly be a surprise that he uses it now in the context of disease.</p> <p>Equally in character was his preference for the vast, sweeping edict over the detailed, calibrated policy response. What the US needs most is a serious, extensive programme of testing. Currently, the US is bottom of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StewartWood/status/1238015271346020352?s=20\" title=\"\">global league</a> table for coronavirus testing, at a rate of just five people in every million. (South Korea is testing 3,692 people per million.) But that kind of announcement would require too much work, not least because Trump shut down the dedicated Obama-era, White House unit that had focused on preparedness against a global pandemic. It would be too dull and plodding for the man who made his name issuing orders on The Apprentice. Trump prefers the kingly diktat that makes instant headlines and good TV. In the 2016 campaign it was his call for a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/07/donald-trump-ban-all-muslims-entering-us-san-bernardino-shooting\" title=\"\">total and complete shutdown</a>\u201d on Muslims entering the US. This time it was a ban on travellers from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/trump-coronavirus-europe-travel-suspended\" title=\"\">26 European countries</a> in the Schengen area, starting on Friday. Once again, the would-be medieval monarch was ordering the drawbridge pulled up against the foreign menace.</p> <p>He surely hoped his subjects would be soothed by such a decisive show of leadership. But because this is Trump, his short speech was riddled with errors that had to be rapidly corrected \u2013 thereby spreading confusion rather than clarity. One example: he announced that his Europe ban would \u201capply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo\u201d across the Atlantic, prompting the White House to rush out a statement explaining that the president had got it wrong, and that the new policy would, in fact, only apply to people, not goods. If the plan was to project a White House coolly capable in the face of a crisis, that mix-up and Trump\u2019s halting discomfort in front of the teleprompter conveyed the precise opposite.</p> <p>Above all, the new policy lacked rhyme or reason. Why keep out almost all Europeans, as if this problem is exclusive to Europe (and China), rather than global, and when the US has a rising infection problem all its own? And why exempt the UK, which is hardly coronavirus-free? There was no explanation, so speculation filled the vacuum. Could it be a politically motivated swipe at the EU, which Trump once said he regarded as the US\u2019s greatest \u201cfoe\u201d, pointedly giving preferential treatment to Brexit Britain? Was it driven by a motive as base as the fact that Trump has <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/trumps-travel-ban-sidesteps-his-own-european-resorts/\" title=\"\">golf courses in the UK</a> (and Ireland), and he didn\u2019t want to harm his own businesses? Or did it spring from a crudely racist worldview that divides the globe into a clean, acceptable Anglosphere set against a tainted, diseased \u201cabroad\u201d?</p> <p>Whatever the explanation, the address did not work. The clearest proof came in the metric Trump understands best and that terrifies him most, because he believes it holds the key to his prospects of re-election.

  "<p>The EFL\u2019s review into the expulsion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/27/bury-takeover-cn-sporting-risk-collapses-hours-before-football-league-deadline\">Bury last August</a> has recommended that the league strengthen its financial fair play rules, blaming the club\u2019s collapse on the current system that allows owners to fund players\u2019 wages.</p> <p>The review, conducted from the EFL\u2019s own Bury files <a href=\"https://www.twobirds.com/en/our-lawyers/j/jonathan-taylor\">by Jonathan Taylor QC</a>, details the dramatic increase in spending on wages after the Lancashire property developer Stewart Day took over the club in 2013. Just four years later, wages had increased threefold to \u00a34.5m, while the club\u2019s revenues grew by less than 50% to \u00a33.2m, so Bury were spending 140% of their entire turnover on wages alone.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/04/review-bury-need-for-ffp-efl-league-one-two-owners-wages\">Review into Bury's demise offers painful reminder of the need for FFP</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Under Day, the club were persistently late paying other clubs and loan players\u2019 wages, but he did put \u00a311.5m into Bury. However, when his property companies began to collapse into administration \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/18/bury-inside-story-financial-ruin-winding-up-petition-loans-car-park\">owing millions to investors and creditors</a> \u2013 the club was \u201ceffectively insolvent\u201d, the review states.</p> <p>Reviewing Bury\u2019s calamitous demise under the ownership of Steve Dale, who bought the club from Day <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/13/bury-new-owner-steve-dale-financial-misery-historic-club\">for \u00a31 in December 2018</a>, Taylor questions whether the EFL\u2019s owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 \u201cfit and proper persons\u201d test is itself \u201cfit for purpose\u201d, and recommends changes to the takeover rules. However these are \u201cmoot\u201d, he says, because the core cause of the collapse was the reliance on funding from Day, which was then lost.</p> <p>\u201cThe real problem is that the EFL\u2019s Salary Cost Management Protocols [its financial fair play rules] do not require League One and Two clubs to pay player wages out of normal operating income, but instead permit them to fund much higher spending through cash injections from the club owner,\u201d the review concludes. \u201cThat means the club becomes entirely dependent on the owner remaining ready, willing and able to sustain that level of funding, and if the flow of funds is cut off, the club is immediately plunged into financial crisis.</p> <p>\u201cI do not see how this furthers the stated objectives of the EFL\u2019s financial fair play rules (to introduce more discipline and rationality in club football finances; to encourage clubs to operate on the basis of their own revenues; to encourage responsible spending for the long-term benefit of football; and to protect the long-term viability and sustainability of EFL football).\u201d</p> <p>Recommending a tightening of the rules, suggesting that owners should invest in long-term club development and be prohibited from bankrolling wages, Taylor concludes: \u201cThe demise of Bury FC therefore highlights the need for a review of the financial ecosystem in which the League One and League Two clubs operate. The EFL and its clubs need to consider again what they want to achieve in terms of financial fair play, and whether the regulations currently in place are fit for that purpose.\u201d</p> <p>SCMP rules limit League One and Two clubs to spending 60% and 50% of their turnover respectively on players\u2019 wages, but classify cash from owners as \u201cfootball fortune\u201d, which can all be spent on additional wages. When Bury won promotion from League Two last season despite being unable to pay the players\u2019 wages, Taylor notes: \u201cOther clubs expressed significant frustration that Bury had achieved this success while failing to meet its financial obligations.\u201d</p> <p>That resentment was partly why clubs voted not to allow a reformed Bury automatic readmission to the EFL next season.</p> <p>Dale defaulted last month on the company voluntary agreement (CVA) he agreed to pay football creditors in full and other creditors 25p in the pound, and Bury, formed in 1885 and a Football League member for 125 years, is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/14/bury-heading-for-liquidation-after-owner-steve-dale-defaults-on-payments-cva-debts\">expected to be put into liquidation</a>.</p> <p>Of the owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test, which is identical to the Premier League\u2019s, Taylor notes it is limited essentially to barring people with unspent criminal convictions involving dishonesty, and those who have been involved in two football club insolvencies. Dale has been a director of 30 companies which have ended up in liquidation, the review states, but a person\u2019s business career is not considered relevant. EFL officials themselves only looked at Dale\u2019s company record after he had taken over and failed to provide evidence that he had \u00a33.6m needed to fund it for this season: \u201cOn 11 December 2018, the EFL executive searched the information filed at Companies House relating to companies associated with Mr Dale, and found nothing that would help to support the required funding commitment.\u201d</p> <p>The review also notes the gap in the rules that do not require a new owner to provide proof of funding before a takeover, but up to 10 days after, which has been highlighted again this week by the unfolding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/10/charlton-takeover-in-chaos-after-public-disagreement-between-new-owners\">chaos at Charlton Athletic</a> where evidence of funding for a takeover has not been provided. At Bury, Dale never did show satisfactory funding, and the review chronicles his various assurances, including proposing to sell properties in Glasgow which were not specified, and a provisional loan offer from a finance company which was ultimately withdrawn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The EFL, whose engagement with Bury was evidently professional and prompt within the limitations of its rules, is emphasising that its board and clubs are now working on improvements to the financial regulations, owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test and other rules.</p> <p>In a statement on publication of the report, the EFL - whose executive, Taylor concluded, could not have done anything more that \u201cwould ultimately have made any difference\u201d to the Bury outcome - said: \u201cWorking in conjunction with clubs, the EFL\u2019s board of directors has established a number of processes to examine potential changes to ensure that problems similar to those at Bury FC do not occur in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Dale responded to the review by insisting that he had in fact fulfilled all required criteria before the club was expelled, and said he is \u201cproposing a new CVA to prevent liquidation\u201d.</p> <p>Bury supporters working on a new \u201cphoenix club\u201d, Bury AFC, have had their application to join the semi-professional <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/31/bury-owner-steve-dale-fails-to-pay-money-to-creditors\">North West Counties League next season</a> provisionally accepted by the league\u2019s board.</p> <p><em>David Conn gave evidence to the EFL\u2019s review, having been asked to do so based on his reporting of Bury FC\u2019s collapse.</em></p>",

We all refused to go because holding a premiere mere weeks after 9/11 with the city still smoking felt like the most insensitive, tone deaf,disrespectful idea possible .But Harvey insisted. We flew into New York and somehow got through it. The next morning Harvey called me and asked if I would  like to bring my less than two year old daughter to his house for a playdate with his similar aged daughter I said ok. I turned up and he immediately called for his nanny to take the babies to another room to play. I went to go with them and he said \u201cNo, you wait here .\u201d The minute the door closed he started screaming \u201cyou stupid fucking CUNT, you CUNT you ruined my premiere .\u201d I had no idea what he was talking about and started to shake.He said,\u201dIf I am throwing a red carpet you get in a tight dress, you shake your ass you shake your tits you do not go down it looking like a fucking lesbian you stupid fucking cunt .\u201d The shock made me burst into tears.I tried to say \u201cHarvey,the city is on fire, people are still looking for their relatives none of us even felt the premiere was appropriate much less coming out dressed like it\u2019s a bachelor party .\u201d He said,\u201dI don\u2019t care -it\u2019s my fucking premiere and if I want pussy on the red carpet that\u2019s what I get\u201d.Screaming. Livid.

  "<p>Six officers including the former assistant chief constable of Greater Manchester police will be investigated for misconduct following an inquiry into the death of a man shot by armed police.</p> <p>Anthony Grainger, 36, was shot through the chest as he sat in a car in the village of Culcheth, Cheshire, in 2012 by an armed police officer known as \u201cQ9\u201d. Detectives believed he and two others were planning to hold up a supermarket and had access to firearms on the evening of 3 March 2012. However, no weapons were found in the red Audi.</p> <p>Several senior Greater Manchester police (GMP) officers were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/11/anthony-grainger-inquiry-police-blame-fatal-shooting\">heavily criticised</a> in a report into the shooting <a href=\"https://www.graingerinquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Anthony-Grainger-Inquiry-Report.pdf\">by </a><a href=\"https://www.graingerinquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Anthony-Grainger-Inquiry-Report.pdf\">Judge Thomas Teague QC</a> last year, which concluded after a two-year public inquiry that the force was entirely to blame for his death due to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/17/anthony-grainger-shooting-public-inquiry-police-intelligence\">serious failings</a> in its firearms unit.</p> <p>On Thursday, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) announced three new investigations into six GMP officers, including the former assistant chief constable Terry Sweeney.</p> <p>Sweeney, who was in effect third in command at the force, and two other senior officers \u2013 the former superintendent Mark Granby and an unnamed former chief inspector \u2013 were under investigation for gross misconduct in relation to their command and control of the operation, the IOPC said. All three officers are now retired.</p> <p>Another investigation is under way into a now-retired chief inspector and former inspector for gross misconduct over the use of a CS gas canister on the night Grainger died. The weapon, which incapacitates its targets, is not officially approved for use but had been used for at least five years by GMP at the time of the police shooting, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/22/manchester-police-used-dangerous-cs-gas-without-permission-court-told\">inquiry into Grainger\u2019s death</a> heard.</p> <p>A third investigation was taking place into a serving GMP officer for misconduct in relation to their management of two firearms officers\u2019 training records, the IOPC said.</p> <p>All but one of the officers under investigation have retired, meaning no action can be taken against them by GMP. An IOPC spokeswoman said it decided not to name four of the officers \u201con this occasion\u201d after receiving representations from GMP and the Police Federation, but that it would keep the matter under review.</p> <p>Amanda Rowe, an IOPC regional director, said the public inquiry had raised further questions about the conduct of some GMP officers before, during, and after the death of Grainger.</p> <p>She said: \u201cHaving these serious matters brought to our attention meant we had to fully consider both Mr Justice Teague QC\u2019s report, and these referrals, before deciding what further actions we may need to take.\u201d</p> <p>Rowe said GMP had cooperated fully with the investigations. </p> <p>GMP declined to comment on why it had sought anonymity for four of the six officers under investigation. It said in a statement: \u201cFollowing the publication of the Anthony Grainger Public Inquiry report in July 2019, Greater Manchester Police sent a further referral to the IOPC. The IOPC are to conduct independent investigations as a result of this referral which will be supported by GMP.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Amazing Stories is \u2013 wait for it \u2013 not that amazing. The new Apple TV+ show, released last week, is a revival of a 1980s series that was overseen by Steven Spielberg. The master director is involved with the reboot, too, which arrives back to take its place within one of the big TV trends of the past few years. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/06/amazing-stories-review-apple-tv-steven-spielberg\">Amazing Stories</a> is an anthology: a collection of self-contained tales rather than a running series. Such shows can be a haven for experimentation and offbeat excellence and ought to be perfect for our low-attention-span age, where new streaming services seem to arrive each week. But, as modern anthologies become more prevalent, so they become a byword for hokey lameness and a lack of quality control.</p> <p>Anthologies in the 21st century are led by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/black-mirror\">Black Mirror</a>, a show concerned with the telling of spooky, tech-related fables. Like its ancient precursor The Twilight Zone, its intriguing set-up/surprising twist/haunting moral format can only be done in an anthology: nobody wants a 13-episode season entirely about a weird app, or a forest that turns out to be made of haunted computers, or whatever.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/25/the-twilight-zone-review-a-pointless-reboot-that-never-enters-the-fifth-dimension\">The Twilight Zone review \u2013 a dire, half-hearted reboot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But as the years have gone by, the perfectly turned Black Mirror episode, with a fresh premise and devastating pay-off, has felt more and more elusive. When new episodes drop, it\u2019s wise to wait a few days for critics and people with more time on their hands than you to let you know which is the single instalment you need to catch. The duds, the ones that aren\u2019t San Junipero or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/21/black-mirror-review-charlie-brooker-nightmare-sterile-world-is-only-five-minutes-away\">Nosedive</a>, recede from view, doomed to appear near the bottom of a hundred \u201cevery episode \u2026 ranked!\u201d articles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8430ce873b5611cdf79d86ec2aebef761c85f5e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8430ce873b5611cdf79d86ec2aebef761c85f5e7/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mackenzie Davis in Black Mirror: San Junipero, Anne Hathaway in Modern Love and the Twilight Zone director Jordan Peele.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mackenzie Davis in Black Mirror: San Junipero, Anne Hathaway in Modern Love and the Twilight Zone director Jordan Peele.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That is the problem with anthologies: yes, it can be good not to have to commit to yet another box set, but the flipside is that collections of self-contained narratives feel innately inessential. When shows employ different writers and directors with wildly differing styles, there is nothing to lock you in and make the next episode a must-see. Unless you are watching something like the Apple TV+ series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/17/little-america-review-eight-immigrant-stories-make-for-truly-radical-tv\">Little America</a>, which is about the immigrant experience and thus thrives on a diversity of stories, the lack of a coherent, singular voice merely guarantees inconsistency.</p> <p>Take the 2019 reboot of The Twilight Zone itself, exec-produced by Get Out director Jordan Peele. It\u2019s \u2026 OK. Hit and miss. Not bad. There\u2019s one called Replay about a weird camcorder that is pretty neat. Really, though, it is devoid of the era-skewering boldness of the original 1950s/60s show, or even a focused new vision of its own.</p> <p>Anthologies are better when they are the vision of one creator or team. The trouble is, coming up with a glut of good, individual scripts is beyond almost everyone. Last year\u2019s Amazon romcom series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/18/modern-love-amazon-ed-sheeran\">Modern Love </a>was a decent halfway house, with roughly half of it helmed by Once/Sing Street director John Carney, and the whole enterprise anchored by being based on an existing New York Times column that could be filleted for its best tales, even if many of them had a charm that was a bit too flighty and diaphanous for TV. Besides, the series also relied on another trope of anthologies to bring in viewers: guest star roles. Roping in the likes of Anne Hathaway, Tina Fey and Ed Sheeran meant producers could bank on audiences tuning in despite shaky scripts.</p> <p> That is not to say that the unicorn of the unmissable anthology can\u2019t ever exist. Ryan Murphy has done some of his best work on American Horror Story and American Crime Story (the latter being the umbrella under which The People V OJ Simpson and The Assassination of Gianni Versace sheltered), although that is an anthology in the sense of each season, not each episode, being self-contained, and, in the case of Horror Story, even that is not always true.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c048b23056ae37377a7c2f53eafe2a1d75ee8811\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c048b23056ae37377a7c2f53eafe2a1d75ee8811/0_0_6371_4247/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Anthologies are becoming a byword for hokey lameness\u2019 ...

Mind you, even there, the more experimental new run faintly suggests that Shearsmith and Pemberton might be tiring under the burden of constantly turning out gems \u2013 and they still have another two series to write.</p> <p>Other successful anthologies embrace their throwaway nature: take <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00vt2q1\">Moving On</a>, the recently returned BBC1 daytime series that is designed to be enjoyed with a rich tea finger and a mug of Mellow Birds.</p> <p>Which brings us back to <a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/gb/show/amazing-stories/umc.cmc.15p55n2osur6c56uam2gxhye3?itscg=MC_20000&amp;itsct=atvp_brand_omd&amp;mttnagencyid=1625&amp;mttncc=DE&amp;mttnpid=305109&amp;mttnsiteid=143238&amp;mttnsubad=ODE2019814-1\">Amazing Stories</a>, whose first episode, The Cellar \u2013 a time-travel tale not unlike the Nicholas Lyndhurst sitcom Goodnight Sweetheart \u2013 suggests a pleasant but dated series is on the way, for you to take or leave.

  "<p>Porridge Radio frontwoman Dana Margolin recently <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/big-reads/the-big-read-porridge-radio-ive-always-known-that-were-the-best-band-in-the-world-2621534\">gave an interview</a> to the NME that took its headline from one of her quotes: \u201cI\u2019ve always known that we\u2019re the best band in the world.\u201d Margolin went on to suggest the current burst of interest in her band was woefully belated (\u201cObviously we\u2019re really good and we know it \u2026 where have you been?\u201d) and that their destiny lay in performing to arenas and sports stadiums around the world: \u201cI wanna be Coldplay, obviously.\u201d</p> <p>This swaggering bravado is standard practice from a certain kind of alt-rock band. The same gobby self-assurance helped propel the Stone Roses, Oasis, Kasabian et al on to the front pages of the music press. The difference here is that every one of Margolin\u2019s statements seems to come accompanied by a roll of the eyes. Porridge Radio are a product of Brighton\u2019s fertile but subterranean DIY scene: a world of cassette-split EPs with American noise bands, debut albums recorded in garden sheds, lo-fi covers of Daniel Johnston songs and free all-day festivals in tiny venues alongside bands called Satanic Ritual Abuse. Whatever you make of all this, you certainly couldn\u2019t accuse the people involved of being fuelled by vaulting commercial ambition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5d869cbbc9b72453a76eb11caac14b6d65338a6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d869cbbc9b72453a76eb11caac14b6d65338a6d/0_0_3000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Porridge Radio: Every Bad album art work\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Porridge Radio: Every Bad album art work</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How we got here, with critics already tipping Porridge Radio\u2019s second album for a Mercury nomination and the NME not merely turning Margolin\u2019s sardonic pronouncements into irony-free headlines but agreeing wholeheartedly with them, is an interesting question \u2013 one that is answered by Every Bad. It\u2019s slick by comparison with some of Porridge Radio\u2019s early releases, but in an era when most putatively alternative rock arrives coated with such glossy depth that it is indistinguishable from chart pop, the production feels appealingly rough around the edges.</p> <p>There\u2019s nothing particularly new about their sound: (Something) maroons an Auto-Tuned vocal over heaving shoegaze guitars; Don\u2019t Ask Me Twice and single Sweet are among a number of tracks that rest on dynamic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/pixies\">Pixies</a>-esque shifts between quiet and loud. This reveals Margolin as one of rock\u2019s great screamers: her hoarse, guttural sound seems dredged up from somewhere deep within, an authentic expression of something dark and tormented rather than an edgy embellishment. Elsewhere, it doesn\u2019t take a huge leap of imagination to picture Porridge Radio\u2019s spindly guitars, shouty backing vocals and shadings of violin and cheap-sounding synth arriving 40 years ago, being signed to Rough Trade and heading out on a package tour alongside Essential Logic and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/apr/03/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1\">Swell Maps</a>.</p> <p>Their skill lies in rearranging familiar elements into something that sounds fresh, largely down to their curious take on songwriting. Porridge Radio are melodically strongest when they seem to be trying the least hard. Their most obviously pop-facing material, recent single Give/Take and the prosaically titled Pop Song, lands in the middle of the album and feels a little flimsy and forced compared with the songs around it, where the standard verse-chorus structure tends to dissolve into the insistent repetition of a single phrase.</p> <p>The first track, Born Confused, has an attention-grabbing opening line \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m bored to death, let\u2019s argue\u201d \u2013 and a faintly anthemic chorus, but it\u2019s over and done within 90 seconds. The remaining half of the song is given over to the phrase \u201cthank you for making me happy\u201d, which starts out sounding bitterly ironic (Margolin has a great line in delivering lyrics in a bruised tone that suggests their very opposite) \u2013 but gradually becomes first cathartic and then weirdly, straightforwardly joyous. It\u2019s a strange way to go about getting audiences to punch the air, but it really works.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27BvZLSzaz8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/27BvZLSzaz8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Porridge Radio: Sweet \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Lilac, meanwhile, turns that emotional journey on its head. This time around, Margolin repeats: \u201cI don\u2019t want to get bitter, I want us to get better, I want us to be kinder to ourselves and to each other.\u201d What looks like a self-help platitude on paper slowly builds up a power at odds with its sentiment, becoming increasingly frenzied and raw-throated, in a way that completely undercuts any optimism. By the end of the song, it sounds confoundingly like a threat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/mar/06/sign-up-for-the-sleeve-notes-email\">Sign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This tension of opposites is a recurring theme, not just in Margolin\u2019s ability to destabilise a lyric with her voice, but in the words themselves.

  "<p>As night fell on 26 March 2019, two small boats made their way north across the Mediterranean. The rubber crafts were flimsy; it would be nearly impossible for those onboard to make it to Europe without help. From the north, a twin-propeller aeroplane from the European Union naval force approached. From the south, the coastguard from the country they had just fled, Libya, was coming.</p> \n<p>The aircraft arrived first but there would be no rescue from Europe. Instead the flight, callsign Seagull 75, radioed the Libyans telling them where to find the boats. But Libya\u2019s would-be interceptors would need more than just the coordinates. \u201cOK sir, my radar is not good, is not good, if you stay [over the boat] I will follow you,\u201d said the coastguard, according to recordings of VHF marine radio picked up by a nearby ship.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2e3eadd7-97b1-4a72-9b61-4e3bf8c9ee39\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Seagull 75 circled overhead.

But the connivance revealed in the audio recordings is supported by previously unpublished letters between high-level EU mandarins, confirmed by inside sources and laid bare in emails from the Libyan coastguard, all obtained by the Guardian. Taken together, this evidence threatens to unravel a conspiracy in the Mediterranean that flouts international law in the name of migration control.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"44aecd53cc581e533d55c3bd29e225bd71d4fd89\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44aecd53cc581e533d55c3bd29e225bd71d4fd89/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People wait to be rescued as they drift in the Mediterranean off the coast of Libya\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People wait to be rescued as they drift in the Mediterranean off the coast of Libya, October 2016.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Mediterranean is the theatre where tensions between Europe\u2019s ideas of human rights do battle with continental politicians\u2019 anxiety about African migration.

Among those returnees were 11 Eritreans and Somalis who complained to the European court of human rights. The court\u2019s ruling in 2012 said Italy was guilty of refoulement and had violated the men\u2019s right to claim asylum and not to be returned to an unsafe port. In rejecting Italy\u2019s arguments, one of the judges pointed out that \u201crefugees have the right to have rights.\u201d</p> \n<p>This ruling, named the <a href=\"https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#%7B%22itemid%22:%5B%22001-109231%22%5D%7D\">Hirsi ruling</a> after one of the returnees, means any refoulement operation, even one carried out by a proxy force, would be vulnerable to international legal scrutiny if an<strong> </strong>EU state could be shown to be controlling and directing these operations. Europe had to find allies in Libya who were capable of intercepting migrants on the high seas without overt direction from the Europeans.</p> \n<p>The project of building a proxy took off in the summer of 2017. At that time Libya, in the middle of a civil war, had no centralised coastguard and no capacity to manage its own search and rescue area. From the outset it was a joint project between Rome and Brussels: Italy provided ships while the EU trained and paid the new coastguards, often <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/N1711623.pdf\">recruiting from among militias</a> and smugglers.</p> \n<p>To bolster the legitimacy of the new coastguard, <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/P-8-2018-003665_EN.html\">paperwork needed to be lodged</a> with the International Maritime Organization declaring that Libya now managed its own search and rescue zone. Court documents from a case in Catania, Sicily, would later show that one of the first telephone numbers listed for the coastguard was an Italian number.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/this-is-europe-nugget-zip/giv-3902djciTE7YISlG/\" data-alt=\"newsletter\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/this-is-europe-nugget-zip/giv-3902djciTE7YISlG/\">newsletter</a> \n</figure> \n<p>But European money and material would not be enough to create an effective interception force. The former militiamen and smugglers who were now in coastguard uniforms struggled to reduce crossings. According to leaked internal documents from Operation Sophia from 2018, after more than a year of training and financial support the Libyan coastguard was still unable to control its own search and rescue area. To stop more crossings to Europe, they were going to need even more help.</p> \n<p>From 2017 the EU began extending surveillance flights over the zone. Two years later, flights by the EU border agency Frontex almost doubled the size of the EU aerial mission. Under the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf\">law of the sea</a> its pilots were bound to contact whichever ship was best placed to assist any boats in distress. But as the Libyans began asserting their presence in the Mediterranean, European flights and their coordinators started giving preference to ships that would take those they rescued southwards, despite the fact that European courts, the UN\u2019s refugee and migration agencies all agree Libya is <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/libya/unhcr-update-libya-16-august-2019-enar\">not a safe country</a>.</p> \n<p>Potential legal consequences are now on the horizon. There are four submissions before international courts and two in the Italian system, accusing Italy, the EU or both of funding and directing the Libyan coastguard.</p> \n<p>\u201cItaly bypassed Hirsi with an artificial edifice of Libyan power, but [an international court] ruling would show that they can\u2019t use this to evade responsibility,\u201d said Itamar Mann, an Israeli lawyer who is <a href=\"https://www.ejiltalk.org/time-to-investigate-european-agents-for-crimes-against-migrants-in-libya/\">leading litigation efforts</a> against the EU and Italy.</p> \n<p>The most recent of these is a complaint to the European court of auditors, the EU\u2019s financial watchdog. The complaint accuses the EU of breaking its own laws by funnelling \u20ac90m <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/trustfundforafrica/region/north-africa/libya/support-integrated-border-and-migration-management-libya-second-phase_en\">earmarked</a> for poverty reduction to the Libyan coastguard.</p> \n<p>Mann alleges that while the Libyans are carrying out the interceptions, in the background it is the EU pulling the strings. \u201cThe EU is using Italy in the same way that Italy is using Libya, to evade responsibility. The main culprit is in Brussels.\u201d</p> \n<p>-----------</p> \n<p>As Seagull 75 left the scene of the rescue last March, the Libyan coastguard radioed back to Operation Sophia to confirm the coordinates. \u201cThree four zero three north, zero one four three one,\u201d said the coastguard. \u201cThat\u2019s correct,\u201d the crew of Seagull 75 replied. The Libyans were pursuing the migrant boats to the northern extreme of Libya\u2019s search and rescue zone.</p> \n<p>The coastguard vessel still could not find the first rubber boat. The second boat was being followed by another Sophia plane, a Spanish aircraft with the callsign Cotos, but it too was running low on fuel. It was becoming increasingly clear that only one of the boats would be rescued that night.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a98b795-e636-4e75-b443-22e9e6429f26\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/this-is-europe\">This is Europe</a> is a new stream of Guardian journalism that investigates the big challenges that transcend national boundaries, and seeks out the solutions that could benefit us all.

After 2012, with Libya stripped of its status as a safe port and the political costs of rescuing migrants rising, European leaders had to find another way to control the Mediterranean.<strong> </strong></p> \n<p>By early 2019 at EU headquarters in Brussels and at Frontex, Europe\u2019s coastal and border guard agency, senior officials were aware that the scale of their involvement with the Libyans risked making them legally responsible for the fate of returned migrants.<strong> </strong>A month before the Seagull 75 incident, Fabrice Leggeri, the head of Frontex, wrote to Paraskevi Michou, the highest-ranked migration official in the EU, outlining the problem.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Exchange of letters between senior EU migration official, Paraskevi Michou and Executive Director of Frontex Fabrice Leggeri.

Nevertheless, the commission and in general institutions may face questions of a political nature as a consequence of the SAR-related operational exchanges of information.\u201d</p> \n<p>Couched in official jargon, Europe\u2019s top border official appeared to be asking the EU\u2019s ranking migration official whether they were crossing the line.</p> \n<p>The response from Michou a month later sought to reassure him that, legally, they were in the clear.

In order to do interceptions, they need to be fed from aerial surveillance,\u201d said Tamino B\u00f6hm, the head of mission for the German NGO Sea Watch. \u201cNearly no effective interceptions would take place without an EU air force assisting them.\u201d</p> \n<p>B\u00f6hm, whose NGO flies its own small surveillance plane through the same skies as Sophia, lists case after case where EU flights relayed data on boats in distress to the Libyan coastguard and to private Libya-bound ships. He notes that NGO vessels and European ships were not called on to rescue as often \u2013 a possible violation of international maritime law.</p> \n<p>\u201cEuropean actors are not only complicit with but directly responsible for pushbacks to Libya,\u201d B\u00f6hm added.</p> \n<p>The UN refugee agency\u2019s special envoy for the central Mediterranean, Vincent Cochetel, said nobody in the international community could pretend they did not understand how dangerous Libya had become.</p> \n<p>Under these circumstances, he said, \u201cno asset of a third country \u2013 naval, aerial or intelligence \u2013 should be used to facilitate return from international waters to Libya.\u201d</p> \n<p>The main connection between European air surveillance and Libyan interceptions at sea is still the rescue coordination centre in Rome. According to two German legal professors, Anuscheh Farahat and Nora Markard, this makes Italy responsible for internationally wrongful acts, \u201cnamely where it violates its obligations under the international law of the sea to make sure a rescue operation leads to a delivery to a place of safety.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"09c80795755a8a2586451997df46d448ca767feb\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09c80795755a8a2586451997df46d448ca767feb/0_0_1900_1071/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A screengrab taken from an undated video from Frontex shows a fishing trawler pulling away from a wooden boat with refugees and migrants onboard\" width=\"1000\" height=\"564\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A screengrab taken from an undated video from Frontex shows a fishing trawler pulling away from a wooden boat with refugees and migrants onboard.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frontex/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Mario Giro was Italy\u2019s deputy foreign minister for two years while the strategy to support the Libyan coastguard was first being developed. Giro said he believed Italian and European leaders, and in particular Italy\u2019s then interior minister, Marco Minitti, were so focused on stopping the flow of people from Libya that they cut important corners. Italian and European willingness to deal directly with militia members and smugglers was \u201ca mistake, full stop,\u201d Giro said.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt that time it was very clear that everybody in Italy and in Europe on the right and on the left was obsessed with the question of migrants. And everybody wanted a quick, immediate solution in the name of trying to control the public opinion.\u201d</p> \n<p>-----------</p> \n<p>Until now the EU and Italy have skirted the line between financing and supporting the Libyan coastguard and taking control of, and therefore responsibility for, its operations. Even when the mask has slipped, as it did when the telephone number listed for Libya\u2019s new rescue centre was listed as an Italian number, the denial of ultimate responsibility is maintained.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur personnel are not embedded onboard of Libyan coastguard assets and Eunavfor Med [European Naval Force Mediterranean] personnel are not part of the Libyan coastguard and navy\u2019s decision-making process,\u201d said Peter Stano, a spokesperson for the European External Action Service, the EU\u2019s diplomatic corps. \u201cNor is EUnavfor Med entitled to exercise any control and authority over Libyan coastguard and navy\u2019s units or personnel.\u201d</p> \n<p>Stano denied any direct coordination of the Libyan coastguard. \u201c[EU] air assets do not exercise any coordination of Libyan vessels during rescue operations. There is no reconnaissance programme,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>However, an email sent by a Libyan coastguard commodore to Alarm Phone, a volunteer monitoring group, in August 2019, obtained by the Guardian, states that EU air assets directly pass information to them. \u201cPlease be informed that yesterday PV LNCG FEZZAN has conducted nr. 2 S.A.R. events, two rubber boat in dangerous distress (sinking) with about 30 and 50 people on board, North-West of Tripoli (around 70 NM), in PSN 3350N-01239E and 3348N-01218E correlated to reports by EUNAVFORMED air asset D0102 and D0105,\u201d the email said.</p> \n<p>Despite the denials, a reckoning appears closer as an array of international legal actions scrutinise every aspect of this cooperation. What emerges, lawyers claim, is a conspiracy to bypass international law and evade responsibility for effectively blocking the Mediterranean.</p> \n<p>A senior EU official close to Libya policy at the time described the Mediterranean strategy as a \u201cpolitical timebomb\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe EU has taken a major reputational risk,\u201d said the official. \u201cWe put our fate in the hands of crooks, the consequences of which are now arriving.\u201d</p> \n<p>In late 2017, decision-makers in Brussels were split between a group of hardliners who wanted Europe\u2019s migration control outsourced to Libya and a reduction in sea crossings at all costs, and others who argued that Sophia and the NGO ships should be allowed to continue rescue operations. The hardliners won out. Now, more than two years later, the presence of European rescue ships in the central Mediterranean is minimal.</p> \n<p>At the end of the coming year, Frontex, which has begun to assume a greater role in Libya operations, will <a href=\"http://www.ekathimerini.com/232591/article/ekathimerini/news/eu-to-boost-frontex-agency-with-more-funds-and-staff\">become the EU\u2019s biggest agency</a> by budget. </p> \n<p>In February EU foreign ministers <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/fac/2020/02/17/?utm_source=dsms-auto&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Foreign+Affairs+Council\">called for a renewal of Sophia</a>, but ministers noted that any indication that it was coming into contact with migrant boats could \u201clead to the withdrawal of maritime assets from the relevant area\u201d.</p> \n<p>The fate of those seeking to escape Libya by boat is likely to mirror that of the migrants caught in the lights of the Seagull 75 in March last year. The occupants of one boat were successfully intercepted by the Libyan coastguard. What happened to those on other boat is contested, but the weight of evidence suggests they are missing, presumed dead.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>This article was supported by the Migration Newsroom, an investigative reporting collaboration between Lighthouse Reports and leading European media.</p></li> \n</ul>",
  "<p>Claire Waxman is drinking tea from a white mug bearing the slogan: \u201cI\u2019m not bossy, I just have better ideas.\u201d It was a present from her daughter, she explains, rather than her colleagues, but for the record, London\u2019s first commissioner for victims certainly is brimming with ideas.</p> <p>Having published the <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/london_rape_review_final_report_31.7.19.pdf\" title=\"\">London Rape Review</a> last summer, a study of more than 500 rape cases exploring why prosecution rates are so low, Waxman is about to launch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/16/impact-on-victims-of-police-phone-seizures-to-be-reviewed\" title=\"\">a crucial piece of research on one controversial aspect of the process</a>: the requirement for rape complainants to hand over their mobile phones for police examination. Reading text messages that may shed light on any relationship with the accused is one thing, says Waxman, but she is concerned that the practice is leading to far broader digital fishing expeditions that drag out investigations and lead to victims dropping out. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/17/data-gathering-may-deny-victims-access-to-justice\" title=\"\">Victims, she believes, are being treated more like suspects</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s adding on six months, if not longer, on investigations,\u201d says Waxman, whose initial review found it now takes almost a year from reporting an attack to a file being submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). \u201cThe longer it takes, [the greater] the impact on the victim and the likelihood of them withdrawing from the process, because in that time frame they can\u2019t really access counselling services freely \u2013 they\u2019re told that if they do so, their notes may be requested by the police and the CPS.\u201d</p> <p>The entire process, she says, is far too \u201cinvasive ... The whole way in which we structure these investigations is very much against the rape victim and against their ability to cope and recover.\u201d Some 58% of alleged victims in her review had dropped out before their case reached court \u2013 many citing the distress caused by reliving the details during the investigation or a desire to move on from a traumatic experience. (Interestingly, the attrition rate was three times higher for female rape victims than male ones).</p> <p>The issue of so-called digital disclosure shot to public attention in 2017, after a handful of high-profile rape trials collapsed following phone messages or pictures coming to light. After that, says Waxman, police started routinely asking for mobiles to be handed over, and she has heard some hair-raising stories <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/21/rape-victims-hand-over-phones-police\" title=\"\">about the way private information has been used</a>. She was particularly struck by one case in a which a woman had a recording app on her phone, which she used for work meetings. \u201cShe didn\u2019t realise the app often stayed on and continued recording, and so it recorded conversations between her and her partner. Those conversations were then listened to by the police.\u201d The woman was asked by the police \u201cin quite an attacking way\u201d why she had discussed the case at home with her partner. \u201cIt was quite shocking because they were looking at material that really shouldn\u2019t be looked at, because it\u2019s like surveillance. It\u2019s almost like going into a coffee shop where you\u2019re sitting with your partner or friend discussing, as you would, what\u2019s happening in your life, personal things, and a police officer recording that.\u201d The case was subsequently dropped.</p> <p>Another rape survivor was horrified to find a selfie in which she was smiling, taken hours before she was attacked, being used out of context in court. \u201cThey used it to say: \u2018Look, she looks very happy\u2019, but they didn\u2019t talk about the time it was taken. And she had no right to respond.\u201d</p> <p>Waxman\u2019s review will look at what intimate information police are asking for, what impact wading through vast caches of phone data has on the length of investigations, and how much of it is ultimately useful in court. \u201cI speak to the judiciary about it and they say: \u2018I\u2019m not interested in what she said to her friend about sex.\u2019 But the police and CPS position has been very much about: \u2018Get everything and then we\u2019ll see what\u2019s reasonable, what we need to consider, because there could be something in that that undermines the case.\u2019\u201d Even in cases of stranger rape where there is no relationship with the accused to examine, she says, school or medical records are routinely scrutinised for anything potentially affecting the victim\u2019s credibility.</p> <p>The Metropolitan police is currently trialling a data-search tool called Magnet, to see if it can sift out relevant information from victims\u2019 phones without undue invasion of privacy. But Waxman\u2019s hunch is that some legal constraints on what can appropriately be accessed may be necessary. \u201cIf you think about the younger generation and how they use their phones \u2013 they don\u2019t speak on a phone, everything is recorded and sent as a voice message. So everything is on there, every thought, every feeling.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s clear that, after two and a half years at City Hall, Waxman still approaches the job from the perspective of someone who has herself been a victim of crime. She was stalked for more than a decade by a former fellow student at her sixth-form college, who repeatedly defied court orders to stay away; the experience prompted her to found <a href=\"http://www.voice4victims.co.uk/\" title=\"\">the charity Voice4Victims</a>, campaigning for improved legislation for victims of crime generally. She recently revealed that, 14 years on, she was still waiting for a court-ordered compensation payment.</p> <p>She is clearly uncomfortable discussing her experience now \u2013 she deliberately doesn\u2019t use her stalker\u2019s name in interviews \u2013 and thought hard about the risks of taking a job that might bring her to public attention. But she says the experience taught her how vulnerable victims can feel. \u201cYou have this misconception that when you report to the police, everything will then be OK. I think the very sobering and sad realisation is that not only is it often not OK, it makes it far worse for that individual because of how fragmented the justice system is, how a victim is very much the afterthought throughout the entire process.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already been disempowered by whatever happened and that justice process only works to disempower you further.\u201d She lost count of the number of times she had to take her stalker to court but \u201ceach time I vowed never to go back into it again because it was so awful. But I didn\u2019t see any other way out. It was all-consuming, highly traumatic, re-victimising.\u201d</p> <p>Waxman is delighted that the Met has established a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/10/stalkers-may-be-tagged-to-alert-victims-to-proximity-police-say\" title=\"\">stalker threat assessment centre</a>, a pilot project seeking to identify at an early stage obsessively fixated stalkers who may not be deterred by the law. Police attitudes have improved, she says. However, \u201cI still get regular cases coming to me and I\u2019m looking at it thinking: \u2018I can\u2019t believe the police haven\u2019t gripped this.\u2019 It concerns me that we\u2019re still not recognising a lot of these behaviours.\u201d</p> <p>Elsewhere in her work, she welcomes potential moves to curb the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/25/fatal-hateful-rise-of-choking-during-sex\" title=\"\">so-called \u201crough sex\u201d defence</a> used in several recent murder trials, by men claiming to have strangled or beaten women to death in sex games gone wrong. (The former Labour minister Harriet Harman has led moves to tighten the law, as part of a domestic abuse bill going through parliament this spring.) \u201cIt\u2019s being used far more widely now as a defence and it\u2019s incredibly concerning, because these victims are not consenting to be killed.\u201d</p> <p>Waxman is concerned about whether there will be enough money to make good on the bill\u2019s central premise, a duty on local authorities to provide enough refuge places for women fleeing domestic violence. \u201cWith all these things, unless there is proper investment and sustainable funding, the issue on the ground is that victims and survivors really struggle to access quality and specialist support services.\u201d Years of cutbacks to the police, CPS and courts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/jan/29/underfunded-justice-system-crumbling-top-criminal-barrister-says\" title=\"\">have had a \u201chuge impact\u201d on the service</a> that victims of crime receive. \u201cThe whole system has been stripped away over the last decade. I don\u2019t say this lightly: the justice system has been creaking for years and it\u2019s at breaking point; it needs proper investment.\u201d</p> <p>Which brings us to the role of Priti Patel, the home secretary. Patel has campaigned for stronger victims\u2019 rights since she was a backbencher and Waxman, who has had several meetings with her over the years, stresses that she has never found Patel anything other than \u201cvery supportive\u201d and \u201cvery lovely to me\u201d. But does she think the home secretary makes a credible champion of victims <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/29/priti-patel-how-bullying-allegations-unfolded\" title=\"\">with bullying allegations hanging over her</a>? \u201cNot currently now, unfortunately. Whether there\u2019s truth in the allegations or not I don\u2019t know, but obviously that does impact her currently. If you are committed to supporting victims, you don\u2019t really want to be accused of creating victims or making someone a victim of abuse.\u201d</p> <p>Her current post is in the mayor of London\u2019s gift, and with Sadiq Khan up for re-election in May, Waxman cannot be entirely sure what the future holds for her. But she clearly intends to make the most of whatever time she has. \u201cIt\u2019s a role that should be here regardless of who the mayor is; without it one doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening on the ground for victims and survivors. It\u2019s influenced so much change not just here in London but the national agenda,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not political, for me it\u2019s all cross-party work. I just want the work done for victims.\u201d And with that, she heads back to her desk, clutching the cold tea she hasn\u2019t had time to drink.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 12 March 2020.

Rita and I are down here in Australia. We felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches. Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too. To play things right, as is needed in the world right now,  we were tested for the Coronavirus, and were found to be positive. Well, now. What to do next? The Medical Officials have protocols that must be followed. We Hanks\u2019 will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires.  Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no? We\u2019ll keep the world posted and updated. Take care of yourselves!

Do your concerns around the ineffectiveness of lower interest rates bear much on the size of the stimulus that you\u2019re announcing today?</p> <p><strong>Josh Frydenberg: </strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, I think one important aspect of all of this is the alignment between monetary and fiscal policy. </p> <p>That\u2019s really important because, as the prime minister said, this is a $17.6 billion package, the bulk of which is going out the door before June 30, and we did welcome the fact that the interest rates were passed on by the banks. </p> <p>I\u2019ve spoken to <strong>Phil Lowe</strong> actually today. And he continues to watch very closely what\u2019s happening with debt yields, what\u2019s happening with bond yields, what\u2019s happening with credit spreads, what\u2019s happening with liquidity in global markets. </p> <p>He\u2019s made some comments about that and obviously monetary policy is the remit of the independent Reserve Bank of Australia. </p> <p>But I think it\u2019s important to understand that this is very different to the GFC in a number of respects. </p> <p>This is not a financial system problem. This is not a liquidity crisis. This is a health crisis. But one of the other differences is that with the GFC, there was a lot more room with monetary policy to respond. </p> <p><strong>This time, monetary policy globally is pretty much exhausted</strong> and we did see the Bank of England substantially reduce their rates down to, I think, 0.25% overnight. So it\u2019s a different situation, but there is an alignment between this government and the Reserve Bank about getting money out the door to support jobs and growth.</p> </blockquote> <p>That is an acknowledgement that the economy is in worse shape, globally, then when the GFC hit.

  "<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My smart TV is old (Samsung, 2014) so I watch BBC iPlayer on my Now TV box (also old and discontinued). What is the best device for all the popular streaming services including the upcoming Disney+? To my knowledge, it is not yet confirmed if it will be available on my Roku-powered Now TV box. <strong>Adnan</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>You may be in luck, because Disney has just <a href=\"https://www.skygroup.sky/article/sky-and-disney-announce-new-multi-year-deal-for-disney-+\">signed a deal with Sky</a>. As a result, <a href=\"https://preview.disneyplus.com/uk\">Disney+</a> will be available via Sky from its UK launch on 24 March, to be followed by Now TV in the coming months, says Sky. It\u2019s not clear how many months that means. Perhaps Sky does not know. However, I\u2019d assume it means some time this year, not next.</p> <p>For those who have not caught up with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney%2B\">Disney+</a>, the service was promised in 2017 and launched in the US late last year. The company knows it is a decade late to the film-streaming market pioneered by Netflix in 2010. It can make up for that by making its service available across a wide range of geographies and technologies.</p> <p>Disney+ will be available via web browsers on PCs, on Android and Apple iOS smartphones and tablets, on Amazon Fire TV and Fire tablets, on Roku streamers, on Apple TV, the Sony PlayStation 4 and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox One, and via Google Chromecast.</p> <p>It will also cover almost all the big smart TV platforms: Roku TV, Android TV, LG\u2019s WebOS and Samsung\u2019s Tizen. In the UK, BT and Virgin Media still appear to be missing, but pretty much every Ask Jack reader should be able to get Disney+ on a device they already own.</p> <p>Disney is also pricing the service to attract annual signups, with a pre-launch offer of \u00a349.99 (\u00a310 off) if you subscribe on or before 23 March. This includes HD and 4K videos, for which other services may charge extra. It will also let you download movies to watch later.</p> <p>Disney+ will not initially have the volume of content you can get from Netflix or Amazon Prime. However, Disney\u2019s string of takeovers of Pixar (2006), Marvel (2009), Lucasfilm (2012) and 21st Century Fox (2017) means it makes up in box office appeal what it lacks in depth.</p> <p>It\u2019s got Star Wars plus The Mandalorian, the Toy Story series and the rest of Pixar\u2019s back catalogue, the Marvel movies and Disney\u2019s studio productions, including a vast library covering everything from the original 1928 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steamboat_Willie\">Steamboat Willie</a> (Mickey Mouse\u2019s first short film) to several versions of Beauty and the Beast. It\u2019s also going to spend something like $1bn a year on new productions.</p> <p>There\u2019s no guarantee that Disney+ will be available on every major platform in every country, so you should check before you subscribe. Nonetheless, I expect it will appeal to families with children of all ages. In the long term, it should give Netflix some real competition.</p> <h2><strong>Now TV</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9023d06e30d9241a7b488d03af34f38e8c100a73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9023d06e30d9241a7b488d03af34f38e8c100a73/35_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Now TV smart stick\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Now TV smart stick is a popular choice because it\u2019s cheap, but may not support all the services you want.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now TV boxes are based on Roku technology but don\u2019t provide all of Roku\u2019s services. Instead, they are customised for Sky TV viewers, who want to watch Sky Sports, Sky Cinema, and so on. The platform\u2019s attractions are that the boxes are generally quite cheap, and discount coupons let you buy services for a short time rather than paying for annual subscriptions. Sky Sports sells expensive passes that last for a day, a week or a month.</p> <p>If you use Sky\u2019s streaming services, <a href=\"https://help.nowtv.com/article/what-apps-are-available-on-now-tv-box-stick\">Now TV</a> is a good choice. You can watch BBC iPlayer and other British catch-up services, plus Netflix and other video services, though not Amazon Prime. If you don\u2019t watch Sky, you\u2019d be better off with a Roku streamer or something similar.</p> <p>It really depends on how keen you are to get Disney+, how keen you are to buy a new gadget and which other services you need. For example, someone who mainly watches Amazon Prime may lean towards a Fire TV, while the odd bod who subscribes to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/01/apple-tv-should-you-shell-out-for-the-new-streaming-service\">Apple TV+</a> may prefer an Apple TV box.</p> <h2><strong>The joy of Roku</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"01394680b82254e8bec548d71a0c995ce887a932\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01394680b82254e8bec548d71a0c995ce887a932/352_212_2459_1476/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A streaming TV\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Roku platform is now built into TVs including Hisense and others.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hisense</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Roku got started when Netflix decided not to make its own streaming device but gave Roku\u2019s founder \u2013 Anthony Wood, a former Netflix vice-president \u2013 a $6m investment to create one. Since then, Roku has positioned itself as an independent supplier in a somewhat balkanised market.</p> <p>It did deals to provide \u201cchannels\u201d (apps) for Amazon videos and, more recently, Apple TV+. It also provides a free software development kit that enables anyone to create a channel in a Visual Basic-style scripting language called BrightScript.</p> <p>In 2014, Roku launched Roku TV, which enabled TV manufacturers to build its system into smart TV sets. These can be updated in much the same way as Roku streaming sticks, and seem to have become popular in the US. Hisense, a Chinese TV manufacturer, launched <a href=\"https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2019/11/22/roku-tv-to-enter-uk-market-for-black-friday/\">the first Roku TV in the UK</a> and Europe in November.</p> <p>Roku hardware is usually cheap because the company makes almost two-thirds of its revenues from CTV (connected TV advertising), not sales of devices. It should also get a cut when Roku owners use their device to subscribe to paid-for channels. More users means more money.</p> <p>Some Roku devices had voice search and control, and last year Roku launched <a href=\"https://blog.roku.com/en-gb/alexa\">a skill for Alexa</a>. (Note: needs Roku OS 8.1 or later.) I have not tried it, but if you own an Amazon Echo, Dot or Show etc, your Roku should work with it. However, given that voice commands don\u2019t seem to work all that well on Amazon\u2019s Fire TV, don\u2019t set your expectations too high.</p> <p>As mentioned, many people will choose a device because it\u2019s connected to or promoted with a service from Amazon, Apple, Google, Sky or whatever. For those who want Netflix and a decent range of services, Roku provides a good baseline at an affordable price. An <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Amazon-Fire-TV-Stick-Streaming-Media-Player-Alexa/dp/B0791RGQW3\">Amazon Fire TV Stick</a> is a reasonable alternative. Amazon\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_OS\">Fire OS</a> is a fork of Android and has <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Amazon-Fire-TV-and-Fire-TV-Stick-Apps-and-Games/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=5862531031\">plenty of apps</a>.</p> <h2><strong>More power?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3121b86f00c06ce1d8ea4ad4648aa89ac3d873ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3121b86f00c06ce1d8ea4ad4648aa89ac3d873ae/328_291_4394_2637/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nvidia\u2019s new Shield TV\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nvidia\u2019s new Shield TV is the top Android TV box, but there are many cheaper alternatives.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Streaming sticks are tiny computers complete with a processor, memory and an operating system. If you are willing to pay a bit more, you can get one with a faster processor and more memory, which should deliver better performance. Some can also play quite good games. The leading examples include Nvidia\u2019s Shield TV, based on the Android TV platform, and Apple TV.</p> <p>The basic idea of <a href=\"https://www.android.com/tv/\">Android TV</a> \u2013 successor to the failed Google TV \u2013 is to use Android for streaming. It can be supplied in a set-top box or built into a TV set. Of course, Android apps are designed to work with touch on a smartphone, not with a remote control on a big TV screen, so they must be adapted. Check which apps are available in the Google Play Store for Android TV.</p> <p>The saving grace is that all Android TV devices support Google Cast, so you can set up streaming from another device and use your smartphone as the controller. Once installed, streams are downloaded directly, just as with a Roku. They are not sent from the originating smartphone, tablet or PC. Some devices also support Google Assistant, which can be handy.</p> <p>Asus developed the first Android TV in 2014, but the platform has been swamped by <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Streaming-Clients-Android-TV-Media-Devices/s\">dozens of devices from obscure Chinese brands</a>. It\u2019s impossible to say which one might be best. However, you can check for Android 9 (Pie) plus ethernet, HDMI 2 and USB 3 ports, dual-band wifi, 4K video support with H.265 decoding in hardware, more storage, more memory and other familiar computer features. Most of them cost from about \u00a325 to \u00a355 so it\u2019s not a huge risk.</p> <p>The standout Android TV box is the <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/shield/\">Nvidia Shield TV</a>, which comes in standard and Pro versions at \u00a3149.99 and \u00a3199 respectively. Samuel Gibbs, the Guardian\u2019s consumer technology editor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/26/nvidia-shield-tv-review-the-best-android-tv-box-with-brilliant-ai-upscaling\">reviewed one</a> a couple of weeks ago and gave it five stars. As he says, the Shield TV is built to last \u2013 but it is priced accordingly.</p> <p>The alternative is to buy cheap streamers for \u00a320-\u00a350 and treat them as disposables. That works for me.</p> <p><strong>Have you got a question? Email it to <a href=\"mailto:ask.jack@theguardian.com\">Ask.Jack@theguardian.com</a></strong></p>",
  "<p>The good news is that last year the Turkish poet \u0130lhan \u00c7omak won a major award, the Sennur Sezer poetry prize, for his eighth and most recent book of poems, <em>Geldim Sana</em> (I Came to You). The bad news is that he is in prison and has been in prison for 26 years, since his arrest as a geography student at the age of 22. All his books have been written in prison.</p> <p>How did he come to be there? One factor, most likely the main factor, is that he is Kurdish. That is not a crime in itself, but belonging to, or even associating with a Kurdish political organisation is. There is also the specific matter of starting a forest fire, but no serious evidence has ever been brought to prove that. The only \u201cproof\u201d was his confession under torture and this has been highlighted in any appeals to free him.</p> <p>It is not unusual in Turkey for writers to be imprisoned. There have been, and still are, too many to mention here but none has been incarcerated for as long as \u00c7omak. Some have published from inside, some with great success. One of Turkey\u2019s greatest poets, N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet, who died in 1963, spent much of his life in prison or exile.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b9193874be1ea3d6276c5e07826dc87db5d16c5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9193874be1ea3d6276c5e07826dc87db5d16c5c/16_0_468_281/468.jpg\" alt=\"\u0130lhan \u00c7omak \u2026 appeals against his sentence have been constantly delayed\" width=\"468\" height=\"281\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u0130lhan \u00c7omak \u2026 appeals against his sentence have been constantly delayed</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Putting aside writers, there remain the students. Following the Gezi Park environmental protests of 2013 there were over 70,000 students in Turkish jails and total numbers will have swollen since the attempted military coup of 2016. The precise number is unknown.</p> <p>After the abortive 2016 coup some 53 newspapers were shut down. Many more media organisations were outlawed. There is regular pre-trial detention for those writing or sharing social media messages thought to be even faintly or indirectly subversive. Above all, perhaps, it is the the Kurdish population and Kurdish writers who have been most affected. The Kurdish Insitute was closed after 2016 and the very existence of Kurdish literature is under threat. \u00c7omak\u2019s poems are increasingly appearing in English translation though not yet in book form. </p> <p>Should we think of \u00c7omak as a prisoner who happens to write books of poetry? The poems need no such framing. They are not political in the sense that they advocate any specific point of view. His concerns have been elemental and full of memories of freedom, love and companionship. As he writes in \u201cLife Does Not Lie\u201d, translated by Caroline Stockford:</p> <blockquote> <p>I am between the moon and the tide. <br>Between the whisper and the scream. <br>As a child I still had the script of a child, I was hostage to my mother\u2019s pomegranate smile. <br>When I looked from the window to the full light of the garden <br>Watching the philosophy of hands plucking the fruit tree, <br>In those times when we still heard the sounds of frogs, <br>When women passed through my life, the lake was blue <br>And I knew the value of blue. I understand pain too, on the steps of life.</p> </blockquote> <p>A fellow poet, Haydar Erg\u00fclen, suggests the poems could have been written inside or outside prison walls. And of course we must remember it wasn\u2019t for his poetry that \u00c7omak was imprisoned. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/feb/28/free-kurdish-poet-ilhan-sami-comak\">Free Kurdish poet Ilhan Sami \u00c7omak | Letter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His contacts with the outside world are very limited. He has been shifted from prison to prison to prevent his parents having access to him, but they have followed him each time. It is worth noting that Britain has strong economic ties with Turkey and could demand the immediate release of \u00c7omak as a precondition to any agreement. Appeals against his sentence have been constantly delayed but his poetry, rightly, reaches ever more readers. </p>",
  "<p>Last week, 24 former members of the women\u2019s cross country team at Connecticut\u2019s Wesleyan University, myself among them, published <a href=\"http://wesleying.org/2020/03/02/part-2-25-testimonials-from-womens-cross-country-alumnae/\">testimonials</a> detailing their toxic experiences as competitive college runners. Leading the effort was Yuki Christina Hebner, a 2017 graduate who wrote <a href=\"http://wesleying.org/2020/03/02/womens-cross-country-alumnae-speak-out-on-culture-of-disordered-eating-injuries/\">an open letter</a> about the destructive culture pervasive across athletics, bought into by the coach and abetted by a blind administration, of disordered eating, body shaming, injury and high rates of attrition.</p> <p>With the signatures of 36 alumni in all, we have presented a list of demands to the university. Saliently, they do not include removal of the coach. Rather, they require that this or any coach\u2019s capacity for direct or collateral damage be checked by <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1941738112439685\">oversight, education and collaboration</a>.</p> <p>The testimonials describe experiences going back eight years: stories of second-tier treatment compared to the stick-and-ball sports at the athletic training facilities; <a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/sportsmedarthro/fulltext/2002/10010/stress_fractures_in_the_female_athlete.12.aspx\">fractures</a> in femurs, feet and tail bones; exercise-induced blackouts; panic attacks; the \u201cfat talk\u201d, in which a runner is told that her weight hampers her potential; <a href=\"https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/eating-disorders-athletes\">eating disorders</a>; <a href=\"https://www.runnersworld.com/health-injuries/a20855296/what-runners-need-to-know-about-missing-their-periods/\">missed periods</a>; <a href=\"https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/53/10/628\">anemia</a>; instructions by a non-specialist to take birth control; increased pressure on runners perceived as faster and decreased interest in those perceived as slower; petty and punitive reactions by the coach after poor athletic performances; scapegoating; and, for many, a loss of the love for running.</p> <p>Some of the women have chosen to come forward anonymously, believing in the necessity of their stories to effect change but having reservations, for diverse reasons, about being named. Many of the women expressed hesitance about publicly sharing experiences that felt personal not only to them but to the team, the school and even to the sport itself. Above all, however, they have expressed a mixture of disappointment, frustration and anger at: first, feeling isolated when the problems actually occurred; and, second, not being listened to when they did summon the courage to speak up.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://wesleying.org/2020/03/02/part-3-what-the-athletic-department-knew-and-when/\">timeline</a> lays bare repeated attempts to discuss these issues with the athletic administration extending back nearly a decade. The second try, in 2013, was an email I myself wrote to the director of athletics. As a then-recent cross country alumna, I had been asked to provide a letter of evaluation on behalf of our coach, who was up for reappointment and promotion. While I had some good things to say, I also stated concerns similar to what ultimately appeared in the testimonials. In 2013, I told the administration I was worried that, unless changes were made, \u201cthere will be future Wesleyan students who have profound and echoing negative experiences.\u201d Never have I wanted less to be proven right.</p> <p>From an exterior perspective, the situation seems impossible. As three-season athletes, we trained seven days a week, 49 weeks out of the year. How could people who ran every single day together, ate together, often even lived together not be immediately horrified that their teammates \u2013 and they themselves \u2013 were enduring rampant injury, illness and psychic degradation? How could it take eight years to connect with one another and develop a collective awareness of the issue?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They say you can\u2019t read the label when you\u2019re inside the jar. While on the team, we were all inside the jar</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This can be attributed in part to the very nature of distance running, which \u2013 like gymnastics, swimming and diving \u2013 can engender hermeticism. Cross country is a team sport but it is experienced, on many levels, individually. The triumphs can be communal but the burden to perform is individual. Training over the summer, I often logged 40 to 50 miles a week entirely alone. You run together, but only you know how much you sleep, the entirety of what you eat, how you really <em>feel</em>.</p> <p>The problem is that, in distance running at the collegiate level, even if a coach is not an abuser, he exerts an extreme level of control: over your eating, your sleeping, your class schedule \u2013 your body and your mind, which in running are intimately linked. There is a reason those speaking out today are alumni, many like myself more than five years removed from graduation. They say you can\u2019t read the label when you\u2019re inside the jar. While on the team, we were all inside the jar. With no administrative accountability or oversight, with a willfully ignorant director of athletics and NCAA staff, we had only our coach to give us direction \u2013 and tell us what we were made of.</p> <p>Credit also goes to how society currently talks \u2013 or doesn\u2019t \u2013 about subjects like women\u2019s bodies, eating disorders and mental health. Even when some women \u2013 mainly those who had left the team and gained the perspective of remove but remained close with current runners \u2013 did recognize that their friends were in pain, they struggled to articulate what exactly had gone wrong. They did the best they could to take care of one another at the time, whether by fostering supportive spaces in their dorms or accompanying teammates to the hospital. Yet they felt stymied by the lack of both a vocabulary to translate their concerns into lasting change and an infrastructure receptive to the message.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9f352e542076735a0264ebd48afa18d6f6f877be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f352e542076735a0264ebd48afa18d6f6f877be/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"NCAA Division III women's cross country championships\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The problem is that, in distance running at the collegiate level, even if a coach is not an abuser, he exerts an extreme level of control: over your eating, your sleeping, your class schedule \u2013 your body and your mind, which in running are intimately linked.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Zuzga/NCAA Photos via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the better part of a decade, we threw our voices into a well and heard only our own echoes. In 2012, Claire Palmer met with the director of athletics to discuss issues of team culture and received no follow-up. In 2013, I wrote to the same director and was led to believe that my \u201cfrank and full appraisal\u201d would be appreciated and considered; I received no response. Between 2014 and 2015, a senior repeatedly met with our coach to voice concerns about <a href=\"https://www.runnersworld.com/news/a20837236/college-runner-explains-why-she-went-public-with-her-weight-gain/\">how weight was discussed with runners</a> and differential treatment of women on the team. In 2015, a group of athletes \u2013 track and cross country, men and women \u2013 voiced issues about equal access to trainers and injury-care facilities. When distance runners repeated their concerns about coaching at this meeting, the director of athletics claimed that complaints had never been raised before.</p> <p>In 2018, as a fifth-year student pursuing a master\u2019s degree, Christina Hebner reached out to the Title IX department at Wesleyan and was redirected to the athletic administration. She met with administrators for two hours, outlining everything that appeared in last week\u2019s open letter and more. The administrators reassured her that changes would be made and that her speaking up would make a difference. When she followed up about making uniform sizes other than XS and S available and establishing communication between the cross-country women and a female administrator, however, she never heard back.</p> <p>Finally, inspired and vindicated by the recent testimonial of former Nike Oregon Project runner <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/opinion/nike-running-mary-cain.html\">Mary Cain</a>, she took an alternate route. With former teammate Rachel Unger, she reached out to alumnae she knew, who reached out to alumnae they knew. I have never met Christina in person, yet learning her story and strategizing with her and fellow runners about how to fairly, clearly and effectively convey our feelings and situations, I feel as though we logged hundreds of miles together.</p> <p>Over two months, 36 alumni reconnected through a growing network on social media and group chats, discovering commonalities in our experiences across many years. We trawled through years-old email threads and dredged up letters to administration that were long forgotten. We constructed a timeline and a paper trail. We documented an extensive record of receipts that revealed an administration that had purported to take action while issuing non-response after non-response. The lack of baseline acknowledgement from the administration in the face of repeated complaints, combined with a suppressive cultural discourse and the individual nature of the sport itself, had created a climate of isolation that siloed our voices. Now, by finding each other, we have finally accrued the critical mass to trigger, and hopefully sustain, meaningful change.</p> <p>The demands presented to the university include: prohibiting the coach from advising athletes on the women\u2019s team about issues like weight and menstruation without the accompaniment of a trained professional; establishing a protocol for understanding why and how often athletes leave the team; assigning an athletic injury care staff member trained on the specific risk factors and pathological symptoms associated with endurance sports to each of the school\u2019s racing teams; increasing administrative accountability for both athlete health and coaching; and, when coaching positions do become available, implementing a new, more inclusive and athlete-focused hiring process.</p> <p>Last week, when faced with the reality of two dozen women going public with testimonials \u2013 seven years and nearly 11 months after Claire Palmer first met with the director of athletics to share her concerns \u2013 Wesleyan finally launched an investigation. On his blog, the university president apologized for \u201cthe profoundly negative experiences that the women recount in their moving testimonies\u201d and pledged to \u201ctake all necessary steps to fix any systemic issues and to ensure the health and well-being of our student-athletes\u201d. Since then, an email dialogue has opened up between those who spoke out and the administration, including the president. The response feels dignifying and encouraging after what feels like countless years of silence. But it should have never reached this point for the school to meet its basic duty of protecting the athletes under its care.</p> <p>This is not just a sports story. This only happens to be about Division III cross country, but it could be about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/16/gymnastics-larry-nassar-sexual-abuse\">USA Gymnastics</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/08/nbc-gabrielle-union-metoo-ronan-farrow-matt-lauer\">NBC News</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/08/womens-health-care-gaslighting/567149/\">healthcare gaslighting</a> or any one of countless other instances where systems intended to provide support repeatedly ignore \u2013 or worse, feign ignorance to \u2013 the distress of those within its charge. This is about the erasure of voices, particularly those of women. It is also a matter of protocol. If we can\u2019t get the smaller complaints right, how can we hope to handle the big things when they occur?</p> <p>Our goal is not <em>revenge</em>. Our goal is answers and proper treatment, for ourselves and for others, for now and in the future. When it comes to systemic suffering, no one wants to say <em>I told you so</em>. What we want is for those in positions of power and control to listen \u2013 not when they\u2019re forced to, but as soon as they can \u2013 and to respond.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>In response to this article, a spokesperson for Wesleyan University issued the following statement: \u201cThe testimonies from this alumna and others from the team are profoundly disturbing. President Michael Roth <a href=\"http://roth.blogs.wesleyan.edu/2020/03/02/on-testimonies-from-student-athletes/\">has apologized</a> for their experiences. An investigation is underway by the University\u2019s Office for Equity &amp; Inclusion, and we\u2019ve asked anyone with information to report it. The coach at the center of these allegations has been placed on leave pending the outcome of the investigation. We have pledged to take all necessary steps to fix any systemic issues that are brought to light, and we are committed to ensuring the health and well-being of our student-athletes.\u201d</em></p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>The US actor Tom Hanks and his wife, Rita Wilson, have been diagnosed with coronavirus while filming in Australia.</p> <p>The 63-year-old Academy Award-winning actor is currently on the Gold Coast in Queensland filming Baz Luhrmann\u2019s untitled production about Elvis Presley.</p> <p>Hanks wrote on Instagram on Thursday that after he and Wilson had been feeling \u201ca bit tired, like we had colds\u201d they arranged to be tested for the virus and had been \u201cfound to be positive\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-live-updates-who-declares-pandemic-as-italy-introduces-stricter-measures\">Coronavirus live updates: US suspends all travel from Europe for 30 days, excluding UK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe felt a bit tired, like we had colds and some body aches,\u201d he wrote on his official Instagram page.</p> <p>\u201cRita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too. To play things right, as is needed in the world right now, we were tested for the coronavirus, and were found to be positive.</p> <p>\u201cWell, now. What to do next? The medical officials have protocols that must be followed. We Hanks\u2019 will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires. Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no?\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian understands that early on Thursday morning cast and crew attached to the film received an email instructing them to stay away from set after a member of the production tested positive for the virus.</p> <p>The couple are now in isolation in a Gold Coast hospital. The premier of Queensland, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said on Thursday that health officials would conduct contact tracing to determine who had been in close contact with Hanks and Wilson.</p> <p>\u201cPeople who have come in close contact with Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson will now need to self isolate and quarantine,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Famously approachable, Hanks had regularly posed for photos with fans at Coolangatta Beach on the Gold Coast and a cafe near Mount Warning on the New South Wales far north coast.</p> <p>But the premier said she did not believe a selfie would constitute close contact.</p> <p>\u201cTom has been having a wonderful time on the Gold Coast and we are so lucky to have Tom in Queensland,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cBut what it is, is people who have come in very close contact with him in recent days [our] experts will now work very closely with him with Baz [Luhrmann] and all the cast the crew and then they will isolate those people who have been in that close proximity.</p> <p>\u201cFrom what the chief health officer has told me it\u2019s over 15 minutes of being in very close contact, so a selfie wouldn\u2019t count as that.\u201d</p> <p>She said Hanks and Wilson would receive \u201cthe best treatment in our hospital\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very confident with the physicians that we have that will be treating Tom and his wife and like I said we wish them all the very best for a speedy recovery,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI know the thoughts of Queenslanders and all Australians are with Tom and Rita during this time.\u201d</p> <p>In a video posted to Instagram Chet Hanks, the couple\u2019s son, said he\u2019d spoken to his parents who were \u201cnot tripping\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up everyone, um, yeah it\u2019s true my parents got coronavirus. Crazy,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI just got off the phone with them, they both are fine, they\u2019re not even that sick, they\u2019re not worried about it, they\u2019re not tripping, but they\u2019re going through the necessary health precautions obviously.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything to be too worried about, I appreciate everyone\u2019s concern and the well wishes but I think it\u2019s all going to be alright.\u201d</p> <p>In the lead up to shooting, normal practice would involve lead actors to have close contact with wardrobe and hair and makeup departments for screen tests and sound tests. These often involve close physical contact with potentially dozens of crew.</p> <p>Production on the Luhrmann film had been set to begin filming on Monday. In a statement the US production company behind the film, Warner Bros, said it was \u201ctaking precautions\u201d to protect its employees.</p> <p>\u201cThe health and safety of our company members is always our top priority, and we are taking precautions to protect everyone who works on our productions around the world,\u201d the company said in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been made aware that a company member from our Elvis feature film, which is currently in pre-production in The Gold Coast, Australia, has tested positive for Covid-19 (coronavirus).</p> <p>\u201cWe are working closely with the appropriate Australian health agencies to identify and contact anyone who may have come in direct contact with the individual.</p> <p>\u201cThe individual who tested positive for Covid-19 is currently receiving treatment.\u201d</p> <p>Hanks and Wilson, who is an American singer and actor, had been travelling to different locations in Australia and had posted photos from Sydney and Brisbane on Instagram.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B9duHWNHcs6/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

  "<p>A theatre investment company chaired by the former BBC and ITV boss Lord Grade had \u201ccompletely lost the plot\u201d, a judge was told, as the firm defended a High Court bid to prevent it being put into administration.</p> <p>Michael Grade, former chairman of the BBC and former executive chairman of ITV, was forced to appeal in person to the judge on Wednesday after lawyers for Gate Ventures, a company he has chaired since 2017, quit at short notice over questions of whether they would be paid.</p> <p>Gate Ventures, of which the Duchess of York was a director until December, has been locked in a bitter court room battle with investor and shareholder Zheng Youngxiong, who claims the company owes him \u00a32.5 million.</p> <p>Zheng has twice applied for an administration order against Gate Ventures, which has backed shows such as 42nd Street and Sunset Boulevard, and has had an e-commerce venture with Sarah Ferguson\u2019s upmarket tea brand, Ginger &amp; Moss.</p> <p>In September an insolvency and companies court judge dismissed Zheng\u2019s first administration application. This latest application is his second attempt.</p> <p>Grade, appearing for Gate on Wednesday, requested the company be given one month to obtain sufficient investment from backers, and if unable to do so would then place themselves in members voluntary liquidation.</p> <p>Zheng is alleging mismanagement of funds by the company.</p> <p>Grade told the judge that the company had found itself caught in a battle following the breakdown of a relationship between Zheng, known as Quentin, and the former chairman of Gate Ventures, Hong Kong businessman Johnny Hon.</p> <p>In a statement to the court, Grade said: \u201cFor the last 18 months the board at Gate has worked tirelessly to save Gate Ventures from liquidation or administration following the non-receipt of $10 million (\u00a37.8million) that had been raised for the company by Mr Quentin Zheng and yet, despite numerous assurances by him and others on his behalf, not one penny of those monies has reached the company to this day.\u201d</p> <p>Gate had managed to raise money to fight off the previous administration order, he said, but a decision last week to allow an appeal by Zheng meant costs Gate had previously been awarded \u201cwere no longer payable to the company\u2019s legal professionals\u201d.</p> <p>As a result, the company\u2019s lawyers had \u201cquit at very short notice\u201d.</p> <p>Grade had asked for an immediate adjournment as Gate Ventures had found new lawyers prepared to take the case on a contingency basis, and said he himself was \u201cill-equipped and incapable\u201d of putting the case. The judge refused his application.</p> <p>Grade said specialist counsel believed the company had an \u201cexcellent\u201d case in respect of the $10 million claim against Zheng, and particulars of claim had recently been served. If Gate was not allowed one month grace, the \u201cthe alternative is administration by administrators recommended and funded by the applicant who undoubtedly owes Gate $10 million\u201d, he said.</p> <p>Matthew Parfitt, for Zheng, has told the judge his client is owed \u00a32.5 million by Gate Ventures, which must be paid in April and the company does not currently have the funds to do so. It is argued that the company, which was founded by the songwriter Geoff Morrow may have some value, and that shareholders could reasonably expect to benefit from an administration.</p> <p>Edward Davies, QC, representing another Gate Ventures shareholder, told the judge: \u201cTo use a theatrical analogy this company has completely lost the plot.\u201d</p> <p>It was in \u201cdisarray,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can\u2019t pay its lawyers.\u201d It should be \u201cput out of its misery\u201d and control handed to administrators, he added.</p> <p>The hearing is due to last until Friday when judgment will be given.</p>",

When the Morrison government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/02/coalition-federal-budget-2019-woos-low-and-middle-income-earners-with-195bn-tax-cuts-in-budget\">gave people income tax cuts</a>, they didn\u2019t spend their windfall, they saved it. So targeting one-off payments at people who lack the luxury of saving does seem the best way of sending cautious consumers to the shops to deliver the desired economic benefit.</p> <p>That strategy worked during the global financial crisis, and it is reasonable, in the broad, for Treasury to assume it can work again.</p> <p>My only question would be whether $750 is the magic number; whether that is enough money to coax people to get out and spend for Australia at a time when people are fretful enough to be stampeding into supermarkets and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/07/it-isnt-mad-max-police-warning-after-shoppers-brawl-over-toilet-paper-in-sydney\">getting into punch-ups over toilet paper</a>.</p> <p>Because if we cut to the chase, the success of this package requires two things: speed of delivery and confidence in the community.</p> <p>It requires people and businesses to go out and spend their government handouts, not retreat to their bunkers like doomsday preppers.</p> <p>The problem for Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg is a circular one. As a government you can try to engender national confidence by projecting steadiness, by working up a plan and telegraphing it with as much competence as you can muster. But you are also hostage to events largely beyond your control.</p> <p>The government is hostage to people worried about whether they, or their loved ones, are going to succumb to an illness, which is a visceral fear; hostage to how and when this illness will spread, and the practical consequences of the pandemic (health systems stretched, schools and shops and businesses closing); hostage to whatever market-moving madness comes out of Donald Trump\u2019s mouth on any given day (which must be one of the adrenaline-thumping unknowns of all).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/12/what-australian-governments-coronavirus-stimulus-package-means-for-you-explainer\">What the Australian government's $17bn coronavirus stimulus package means for you</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In closing, a couple more things can be noted.</p> <p>The first is that the government has managed to land this package, and the show hasn\u2019t exploded \u2013 even though this is the Coalition, funding cash handouts to benefit recipients. This is behaviour that in more ideological quarters of the government could be considered highly suspect, even if the overarching objective is to keep people employed and the country out of recession.</p> <p>Just remember the Coalition has spent much of the last 10 years characterising fiscal stimulus, including cash payments, as budget-wrecking communism, so assuming the current discipline holds, this collective epiphany is genuinely interesting.</p> <p>It suggests that sober, expert advice and pragmatic thinking can sometimes prevail over the brimming feelings of the overconfident ignoramuses who loom large in public life and make it their business to be as destructive as possible.</p> <p>I was beginning to wonder whether hoping for sense was a waste of energy, and this stimulus package suggests to me that the technocrats, both in the political and bureaucratic class, are still in the fight.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know about you but I find this reassuring.</p> <p>The second thing to note is that the government has been sensible enough to reserve the right to do more in the event it needs to do more. It has given itself scope to go again at budget time in May if it judges a second round of stimulus is required.</p> <p>This is good scope to have, because right now, we need all options on the table.</p>",

The maze of corridors (with cubby holes for reading) lead to a range of dorms and private rooms. Dusky pink, eggshell blue and emerald green run throughout, with velvet chairs, bold murals, gold fixtures and large plants. The largest room, The Loft, was a winner for my weekend for 2.5 guests (the half being a small dog). There are high ceilings and large windows, and it has a comfy seating area, desk, small kitchen and bathroom. In the lounge-bar downstairs, there are activities including drink-and-draw sessions with Cass Arts. On upper floors (above bedrooms) is a communal kitchen, living-dining area, cinema room and yoga-and-wellness studio.</p> <p><strong>What about breakfast and dinner?</strong><br>The restaurant is due to open in the summer, serving breakfast followed by an all-day menu. Currently, a simple breakfast is included (toast, cereal, juice and hot drinks). The bar serves cocktails, wine and beer all day.

Excavation has continued on the lower ground floor, uncovering older rooms and a staircase thought to have been used by judges to escape trouble. The basement is already used for beer tastings every evening and there are plans to open a whisky bar.</p> <p>The listed building has had many original features restored. The vast courtroom, housing the largest mixed-gender 24-pod-bed dorm, still has original panelling and a vaulted ceiling. There are 200 Japanese-style curtained pod beds across several dorms and 12 private rooms (some en suite) in the former cells, with bolted doors and tiny barred windows. Decor is plain, without being clinical: white walls, grey tartan details. Keep eyes peeled for the graffiti by former inmates on the walls of what were once holding cells, now knocked through to form the staircase; and the refurbished security gates in some corridors. The common room includes pews from the courthouse, with Scots Law pages as wallpaper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33a34907eee1411a97fddb6464d01078d1501ef1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33a34907eee1411a97fddb6464d01078d1501ef1/0_343_1599_1598/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Code hostel, Edinburgh, dorm beds\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>What about </strong><strong>breakfast and dinner?</strong><br>Breakfast is included, with a buffet of fruit, yogurt, cereals, batter to use in the waffle-maker, along with ingredients for cheese toasties.

The first official batch of the single malt will be available in 2023. After all that merriment, a hike up Arthur\u2019s Seat will help shake-off hangovers, followed by lunch round the corner at <a href=\"https://www.theoutsiderrestaurant.com/\" title=\"\">The Outsider</a>, serving soups, salads and nutritious, seasonal food, or at <a href=\"http://www.civerinos.com/\" title=\"\">Civerinos</a> for its 20in stone-baked pizzas (slice from \u00a33.95, pie from \u00a319.75).

On the site of a prison, the hostel is in part of the city\u2019s former telephone exchange, built in 1932.</p> <p>The ground floor is mostly taken up with a cafe \u2013 where I was checked in. My private room was on the snug side and dominated by a huge flatscreen television but was cosily warm \u2013 very welcome since it was freezing outside. There was enough space for a double bed (I slept like a log both nights), a small desk and a couple of wireless phone-charging shelves. Clothes storage amounted to hangers on the wall, and one corner of the room had been sacrificed to a prefab en suite.</p> <p>You don\u2019t come to a hostel to spend time in your room, though. I found it a good space to use as a base and for the rate, it\u2019s exceptional value. There are suites, too, if room to spread out is needed, and traditional dorms if feeling sociable.</p> <p><strong>What about breakfast and dinner?</strong><br>Unlike many YHA hostels, there\u2019s no kitchen for guests to cook their own meals. It is possible to bring cooked food in and staff are happy to supply crockery and cutlery. The hostel does, however, run a funky licensed cafe on the premises. At night, this has a bar feel, with its dimmed lights and industrial exposed-brick-and-girder aesthetic. In one corner, a wall is adorned with photos of the prisoner class of 1873, whose stay on this site was less pleasurable than my own.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6153f992294aede31bc7aba407c7507c9d211b18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6153f992294aede31bc7aba407c7507c9d211b18/0_222_4903_2943/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cafe-bar at Newcastle Central YHA Hostel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cafe-bar</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Breakfast is what you might expect in a hostel: a buffet of cereal, yoghurt (dairy and soya), toast, ham and cheese, and hot drinks and juices. The all-day menu features standard dishes, such as stone-baked pizzas, jacket potatoes, and burgers. However, the light bites section is more adventurous: panko squid strips and mock duck pancakes included! I opted for the Mediterranean vegetable and olive salad, a portion of fries and a non-dairy strawberry and yuzu ice-cream \u2013 all very palatable, as was the bill: \u00a313. And should you stay the night and have children under 10 with you, they eat for free.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s on the doorstep?</strong><br>I came by train, so was pleased to find the hostel an uncomplicated 10-minute walk from the city\u2019s mainline station. It\u2019s a stone\u2019s throw from Grainger Town: stuffed with listed buildings and where most of Newcastle\u2019s shopping, eating and drinking gets done. The area is also home to The <a href=\"https://www.thestand.co.uk/newcastle/whats-on/\" title=\"\">Stand Comedy Club</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theatreroyal.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Theatre Royal</a>.

Since 2007, the company has been refurbishing pubs around London, modernising while retaining character, and adding hostel rooms to the underused upper floors.</p> <p>A popular spot on a quiet corner near London Bridge, The Rose &amp; Crown on Union Street opened in June 2019. It\u2019s a mixture of modern bunk dorms with block colour walls in emerald green and yellow, and shared bathrooms. There\u2019s also a large modern double en suite in the loft, with weathered wood and white brick walls, geometric print carpet and a huge bathroom. The common room is the buzzy pub itself. It had a great atmosphere on a Thursday night, after an evening mooching around nearby Bermondsey. Interiors in the pub mix traditional elements such as wood panelling, green tiling and a horseshoe bar, with modern touches of exposed brickwork, white walls and velvet chairs. </p> <p><strong>What about breakfast and dinner?</strong><br>Brunch is served 9am-6pm \u2013 with options from toast with spreads (\u00a32) to full veggie breakfast (\u00a39) and shakshuka (\u00a310). Noon to 10pm, there are also burgers (from \u00a310) \u2013 including vegan ones \u2013 and loaded fries (from \u00a35.50).

It\u2019s actually closer to two miles, and there are 18 stops to choose from over an afternoon, with Maltby Street market a good starting point for food \u2013 from cheesy Venezuelan <em>arepa</em> buns to rich Ethiopian lentil <em>wat</em>.</p> <p>Round the corner, Bermondsey Street\u2019s Victorian terraces are now home to independent restaurants, boutique shops, basement bars, plus the <a href=\"https://www.ftmlondon.org/\" title=\"\">Fashion and Textile Museum</a> is here too.

His eagerness is borne of potential (25 more beds will be added by June) <em>and</em> adventure, as he and the Sleep Eat Love team are planning a fact-finding tour of Europe and UK hostels. The mission: to improve what Sleep Eat Love offers. For my part, one improvement would be the signposting, as my choice of stairs over lift means a circuitous route around this labyrinth-like former fire station. Still, that allows for fact-finding of my own as I pass hostel staples, such as a laundry room, lounge, games room and kitchen areas.</p> <p>My private en suite double is spacious and wants for nothing, save for a television, though I don\u2019t see that omission as onerous (wifi is free). There are industrial design touches in its lights and fittings, while a flourish-free bed, wardrobe and mirror-frame have a woodchip-effect. It\u2019s all functional and sturdy \u2013 with brightness provided by a colourful mural \u2013 but lacks an overall aesthetic, which explains the team\u2019s search for ideas. The feel of the hostel (and communal spaces) is friendly and secure, aided by a reception staffed 24/7.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aebbe6e002991bbbad8f899325c0ea8303b3d209\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aebbe6e002991bbbad8f899325c0ea8303b3d209/0_490_3758_3758/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bunk beds at Sleep Eat Love Hostel, Liverpool.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>What about breakfast and dinner?</strong><br>Sleep Eat Love\u2019s star turn is its indie-owned veggie- and vegan-friendly cafe-restaurant, <a href=\"https://love-thy-neighbour.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Love Thy Neighbour</a>, which is in the same building \u2013 and open to all, though it offers 20% discount to hostel guests.

For me, a late lunch means a substantial Sweet &amp; Spicy \u201cBuddha\u201d bowl of sweet potato wedges, hummus, charred tenderstem broccoli, coconut paprika chickpeas, coriander, toasted peanuts (\u00a39.95); with breakfast a more straightforward, but equally accomplished, Eggs Benedict (\u00a37.50).

Discoveries of dead dolphins around the Bay of Biscay this year are likely to beat the grisly record set in 2019, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/31/mutilated-dolphins-wash-up-on-french-coast-in-record-numbers\" title=\"\">1,100 were found</a> on the French coast. Large numbers are also turning up on the <a href=\"https://irelandswildlife.com/huge-spike-in-common-dolphin-deaths-around-ireland/\" title=\"\">beaches of Ireland</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The governments of the EU and the UK know their system for monitoring dolphin killing is useless</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Not every dolphin or porpoise that washes up dead has been killed by the fishing industry. Infections are more prevalent than they were before, perhaps as a result of persistent synthetic chemicals accumulating in the animals\u2019 tissues and suppressing their immune systems. But in many places, including the Bay of Biscay, Ireland and probably the Channel, industrial fishing appears to be the biggest cause.</p> <p>The dolphins found on the shore are likely to be a small proportion of the total killed. Most corpses sink or drift out to sea. Because the slaughter is deliberately unrecorded by European governments, we have only rough guesses about how many might be dying. One scientific estimate suggests that around <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1462901116301514\" title=\"\">one eighth</a> of the slaughtered dolphins are likely to appear on beaches. Dolphins are long-lived and reproduce slowly. In the north Atlantic, the common dolphin calves only about <a href=\"https://www.ascobans.org/sites/default/files/document/Inf22_Murphy%20et%20al.%202013%20OMBAR%20CD%20Review.pdf\" title=\"\">once every four years</a>. The unquantified mass slaughter caused by fishing boats, if it is allowed to continue, is likely soon to drive them to extinction.</p> <p>Almost all commercial fishing presents a threat to dolphins and porpoises. But some techniques are more lethal than others. While gill nets kill large numbers of porpoises, and all kinds of trawling and seine netting endanger dolphins, there\u2019s a particularly strong correlation between dolphin deaths and two types of fishing: pair trawlers catching bass and supertrawlers pursuing small, midwater fish.</p> <p>Pair trawlers (two boats pulling a net between them) move much faster than single trawlers. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/07/ban-supertrawlers-from-uk-waters-after-brexit-say-green-campaigners\" title=\"\">Supertrawlers</a> \u2013 100m or more in length \u2013 tow gigantic nets that scoop up entire shoals, and the predators hunting them. Because these ships tend to pursue species used for making the pellets fed to farmed fish \u2013 such as salmon, bass, halibut and prawns \u2013 scarcely any species on sale today can be safely dissociated from dolphin killing.

They know their system for monitoring dolphin killing is useless. It consists of placing observers on around <a href=\"https://www.wcl.org.uk/docs/Gearing%20up%20to%20eliminating%20cross-taxa%20bycatch%20in%20UK%20fisheries%20FINAL.pdf\" title=\"\">1% of fishing vessels</a>, and only with the consent of the vessel\u2019s master. Inevitably, the boats most responsible for the problem tend to be the least monitored. For a quarter of the price of this useless and outdated system, every boat could be fitted with <a href=\"https://greeneruk.org/sites/default/files/download/2018-11/The_importance_of_Remote_Electronic_Monitoring_1.pdf\" title=\"\">remote monitoring equipment and CCTV</a>. But they refuse to enter the 21st century.</p> <p>Last year, the campaign group, Sea Shepherd, sailed into this regulatory chasm, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxJ53j_bHaw\" title=\"\">filmed</a> a French trawler in the Bay of Biscay hauling a dead dolphin on to its deck. The official response? The president of Brittany\u2019s fisheries committee characterised the filming as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/hundreds-of-dead-dolphins-washed-up-on-french-coast/a-52537366\" title=\"\">harassment</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Neither the European commission nor the British government, to judge by the current draft of the <a href=\"https://services.parliament.uk/Bills/2019-21/fisheries.html\" title=\"\">fisheries bill</a>, intends to put this right. Their refusal properly to monitor or regulate the industry amounts to an intentional and systematic cover-up. The measures required to protect dolphins are similar to the measures required to allow fish populations to recover. Large zones should be declared closed to all fishing. Instead, almost all our \u201cmarine conservation zones\u201d can legally be ploughed by trawlers throughout the year. They are meaningless paper parks. Other areas should be closed at certain seasons, when dolphins congregate.</p> <p>Fisheries policy should begin with the protection of dolphins and other vulnerable species, and then decide where and how fishing vessels can operate. But the opposite approach is taken: allow boats to work almost everywhere, unmonitored and scarcely controlled, then wonder what to do about the dead dolphins. The grip of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/05/uk-to-strengthen-sea-patrols-to-ward-off-post-brexit-fishing-wars\" title=\"\">fishing industry</a> on government policy remains as powerful and mysterious as ever.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/09/boris-johnson-trade-uk-fishing-fleet-industry\">Boris Johnson\u2019s hard line on trade could sink the UK\u2019s fishing fleet | John Lichfield</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Is there any difference between the accidental but inevitable mass killing of dolphins by the fishing industry, and the deliberate annual massacre in Japan, that rightly causes such public outrage? If something is morally wrong, no amount of money can make it morally right. The slaughter of dolphins and other magnificent wildlife is, on any measure, morally wrong.</p> <p>If you agree, there\u2019s a simple answer. Stop buying fish. Until the industry has been contained, and its devastating impacts ended, we should withdraw our consent. Otherwise, we too are the killers.</p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>This was taken at the last show of Metallica\u2019s Black Album tour, in Belgium on 1 July 1993. James Hetfield, the singer and guitarist, had walked to the very edge of what they called their \u201cego ramp\u201d [the walkway into the audience]. Because they were touring The Black Album, I was shooting a lot in black and white. I noticed him, with the sunset behind him and the arms coming up, and it became one of my most famous Metallica pictures. It shows the connection between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/apr/19/metallica-the-band-who-reinvented-metal\">Metallica</a> and their audience \u2013 it\u2019s as if they are almost dragging him in. The time of day was important: most bands don\u2019t like daylight, they want it dark. This was shot at twilight, which gives you the perfect balance and that sense of moment. Five minutes later, it would have been dark, and the shot would have looked nothing like that.</p> <p>My aim when shooting a show is to give somebody something they would not normally have seen. And to create an image that is unusual or exciting, so when people who went to the show look at it, they see something that\u2019s special. People who shoot shows tend to panic, but if you do that, you get nothing. Stand back and wait. Think about what you\u2019re doing \u2013 I learned that from <a href=\"https://photos.com/collections/fin+costello\">Fin Costello</a>. I don\u2019t find it hard to get original images from live shows, because I know what I\u2019m doing \u2013 I\u2019ve done it for so long.

But then Metallica\u2019s manager, Peter Mensch, called me and said: \u201cListen, stop being such an asshole.

In fact, the only reason I ended up shooting Metallica was because they wanted Iron Maiden\u2019s photographer \u2013 I was working for them at the time. To Metallica, Led Zeppelin (who I also worked with) meant nothing. But Iron Maiden meant something and Metallica wanted their photographer. I\u2019ve worked with them ever since. I\u2019ll give the group their due: they are very conscious of who they are, what they do and how they want to be photographed.

Where would you rather go? And at the time the National Union of Journalists made sure that if you shot colour you were paid twice as much as for black and white, and Kerrang! was full colour.</p> <p>The worst photoshoot I ever did was the first time I worked with Led Zeppelin in 1979.

  "<p>When the former Blue Peter presenter Konnie Huq told the hosts of Loose Women that she had not bought any clothes in a decade, she was met with consternation and shock from the show\u2019s famously forthright panellists. \u201cYou\u2019re not still wearing Blue Peter clothes!\u201d exclaimed Janet Street-Porter. Huq acknowledged, sheepishly, that the lilac cardigan she was wearing did in fact date from her days on children\u2019s TV.</p> \n<p>Huq\u2019s decision to step away from consumerism and wear the clothes she already has is to be commended, given that the UK <a href=\"https://www.wrap.org.uk/content/clothing-waste-prevention\" title=\"\">sends around \u00a3140m</a>-worth of clothing to landfill every year. And, as the public becomes increasingly aware of the social and environmental impact of the fashion industry, it is likely that more will do the same. Already consumers are turning away from fast fashion. New research from the <a href=\"https://dailybusinessgroup.co.uk/2020/03/gretas-green-plea-turns-shoppers-against-fast-fashion/\" title=\"\">Fashion Retail Academy</a> finds that 51% of Brits are opting to purchase expensive but longer-lasting clothes, rather than cheaper throwaway items, up from 33% a year ago. Many attribute this move towards more sustainable consumer behaviour to the so-called \u201cGreta\u201d effect. (Famously, the 17-year-old Swedish climate activist, Greta Thunberg, doesn\u2019t buy new clothes, telling Democracy Now that <a href=\"https://www.democracynow.org/2019/9/11/greta_thunberg_swedish_activist_climate_crisis\" title=\"\">she shops secondhand</a>, or wears other people\u2019s hand-me-downs.)</p> \n<p>Huq\u2019s no-clothes purchasing policy made headlines across the UK. But away from media scrutiny and bemused TV hosts, many ordinary people have been quietly wearing the same clothes day-in, day-out, for the past decade, too.

But then I went to university to study product design and I realised that consumer culture really didn\u2019t sit well with me. We were being trained to design want and need in people. It didn\u2019t feel right.</p> \n<p>The majority of my clothes are well over a decade old. Some of them do look a bit tatty, I\u2019m not going to lie. I do understand that your first appearance counts for something in society, and that people might look at my clothes and think about me in a certain way. But for me personally, it is more important to be true to what I believe in than care about what other people might think.</p> \n<p>I last bought a Paul Smith jumper about nine or 10 years ago. It was \u00a3140, which is a lot of money, but I still wear it today, and it looks the same as the day I bought it. The most loved item in my wardrobe is a pair of David Beckham-endorsed Adidas shorts I bought when I was 14. I still wear them all the time. The elastic is gone, so I do have to be careful to make sure the drawstring is tied up! They have started to peel a bit.</p> \n<p>My mum and dad are always trying to buy me new clothes. They are Thatcher\u2019s children: materialism was drilled into that generation; buying stuff empowers them. My mum recently insisted on buying me a coat, but only because she was so fed up with the old Barbour jacket I had been wearing.</p> \n<p>It was my grandad\u2019s Barbour: he has sadly passed away, so I took it from his house after he died. That\u2019s not the only thing I took, actually; I wear my grandad\u2019s old Slazenger boxers. My girlfriend thinks it is really weird.</p> \n<p>I loved that Barbour jacket. It was ancient; I kept sending it to the Barbour shop to get it repaired, but they repaired it so many times it was basically a new coat.</p> \n<p>I never get bored of my clothes. I think that people are told that they need to buy new clothes to fit in and seem trendy, but it is only you who inherently cares what you look like. People are too immersed in their own lives to notice you only have four T-shirts. That stuff doesn\u2019t matter. We have become so selfish as human beings. We are bred to consume.

I think that\u2019s why I am really reluctant to buy clothes. It is horrible for me to know that people of my heritage are being abused by the garment industry to produce clothes for people in the west who don\u2019t care about their wellbeing.</p> \n<p>I remember <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/25/bangladesh-textile-factory-fire\" title=\"\">watching the footage of the 2012 Dhaka garment factory fire</a>. It was horrific, watching people try to escape. I don\u2019t like to stand on a soapbox and say: \u201cYou should do this, and you should do that.\u201d But for me personally, buying clothes isn\u2019t something I want to do. It\u2019s how I am.</p> \n<p>Apart from tights and the odd bit of underwear, I haven\u2019t bought any clothes for a decade. I make all of my clothes, myself, by hand. I learned to sew from my mum. She was always immaculate; she never had a hair out of place. Just the sweetest, most caring person. She died recently. When I am sewing, I feel close to her. She really knew how to sew.</p> \n<p>Virtually all the fabric I use is vintage. Buying new fabric is really the same as buying fast fashion, in my book. Why do we need new fabric? There\u2019s already so much beautiful fabric in the world. I work with a charity called <a href=\"https://www.tfsr.org/\" title=\"\">Tools for Self Reliance</a>, and they get donated lots of old material. If I see something I like the look of, I pop a donation in the collection box. I also have reams and reams of fabric that I purchased in the 1980s from a dressmaking shop: it was closing down, and the owner let me have it cheap.</p> \n<p>Most of the time, I am a bit of a scruff. But when I am teaching dressmaking, I make an effort. You want to look nice, because you\u2019re an advert for the clothes you are teaching people to make. I follow trends on social media, and then teach people how to make the clothes <a href=\"https://abis-den-sewing-machine-services.business.site/\" title=\"\">at my workshops</a>. You get all sorts: doctors, solicitors, care workers. They all say it is therapeutic.</p> \n<p>I don\u2019t get bored of my wardrobe, because if I want something new I can just nip upstairs to my sewing room and make it. I can make a shift dress in half an hour; I call them my half-hour dresses. I just made a ball gown from old fabric over a few days.</p> \n<p>I never want to buy things. I look at things in shops and think the quality is abysmal. My daughter makes her own clothes now. I am so glad she is not spending her pennies in those dreadful shops. But I really don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m on my high horse. I just want to educate people.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"730d5f4253f676a166c011a29c293cc50a7dca87\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/730d5f4253f676a166c011a29c293cc50a7dca87/0_282_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jon Watkins\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jon Watkins \u2026 \u2018The last time I bought clothes was in 1984\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Jon Watkins</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Jon Watkins, 70, retiree from Llangollen</strong></h2> \n<p>Everything in my wardrobe is certainly not from this century. I have had the same ties since the 1980s. I think the last time I bought clothes was in 1984: I was on a business trip and they lost my suitcase, so I went to a shop in Rome and bought new suits, shirts, trousers and underwear.</p> \n<p>Technically, I could buy clothes. I know where Marks &amp; Spencer is! I just prefer not to go shopping. Ever since Woolworths closed, I can\u2019t think of a decent shop. Shopping is so tedious. I can do a supermarket shop, because I have to, otherwise I would starve. But that\u2019s it.</p> \n<p>I do occasionally get marched to TK Maxx by some lady friends who buy things for me. Whatever they choose is fine. Everything else in my wardrobe seems to arrive! My brother-in-law gives me shirts and pullovers. It\u2019s usually when people think I am looking mucky that stuff tends to turn up. I never ask for anything new. Hand-me-downs look new to me! I can\u2019t tell the difference.</p> \n<p>I look like a mess, but I don\u2019t really care. It is the same with haircuts: I only get them if I have got to meet the bank manager or something like that. The only thing I buy for myself is socks and pants.</p> \n<p>I have a woman who comes to clean my house for me and she\u2019s not averse to throwing clothes and shoes away that she deems unwearable. I don\u2019t mind as long as she tells me what she\u2019s chucking out, otherwise I spend ages looking for it and can\u2019t find it. She thinks shirts should have all the buttons on them and rubbish like that. They don\u2019t really. As long as there are some buttons, it will work.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d715a9e1619a9cb388c026628c34113e8e31ee1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d715a9e1619a9cb388c026628c34113e8e31ee1/0_936_3024_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Athena Drakou\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Athena Drakou \u2026 \u2018Never buying clothes feels liberating\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Athena Drakou</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Athena Drakou, 59, </strong><strong>semi-retired accountant living in West Sussex, but originally from Greece</strong></h2> \n<p>Thirty-four years ago, I was pregnant with my daughter back home in Greece. The Chernobyl nuclear disaster happened and pregnant women were advised not to eat any fresh food. That experience really changed my thinking about the environment.</p> \n<p>I became an accountant, then moved to the UK and studied environmental science. But my interest in the environment and how we consume clothes never went away. Back in Greece when I was growing up, everything was about consumerism. Being a Greek woman who never went shopping, people thought I was crazy!</p> \n<p>I think I have bought one pair of jeans in the past 10 years. That\u2019s it. My wardrobe is basically empty. It is easy to find everything in there. When I need clothes for a special occasion, like a wedding, I either borrow something from a friend, or there are platforms now where you can rent clothes.</p> \n<p>It helps that I am the same dress size I was when I was 20. I try to keep fit and not gain weight. Everything in my wardrobe still fits. All my clothes are very good quality: I have a coat that I have worn for 24 years. I take excellent care of it and it\u2019s still in good condition. If you looked at it, you wouldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d had it for so long.</p> \n<p>Part of the reason my clothes last is because I don\u2019t over-wash them. I have a rule that I wear everything at least twice \u2013 underwear excluded, obviously \u2013 before washing it. I can wear jeans five or six times before putting them in the machine. I mend all my clothes. If I need a new sweater, I knit something. My friends will often give me wool or yarn. Knitting helps me relax.</p> \n<p>Never buying clothes feels liberating. I love not having to think about clothes all the time. I have a few things in my wardrobe. Everything goes together. I never worry about what I am going to wear. For me, it has always been simple.</p> \n<h2><strong>Andrew Ledwidge, 52, public-sector worker from south London</strong></h2> \n<p>I have a bit of a phobia about new clothes. It is about comfort; I\u2019m very particular about things. I hate clothes that are too clingy or tight. Animal fibres make me really itchy. I think maybe I am a bit allergic to wool.</p> \n<p>I like to wear old clothes, because I know they will be comfortable. I don\u2019t like the texture of new clothes at all. It is a bit of a paradox, because in order for things to get old you have got to wear them a lot. If I had the choice between wearing an old item or something new, I\u2019d always go for the old thing.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eb84d92b-e466-44d5-b40e-9490e6a0a260\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RR7aP4U2L6o?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>My wife likes to sneak a few new things in my wardrobe from time to time, so I am better presented. She is into fashion and is always beautifully dressed. But the new things tend to stay in my wardrobe. I don\u2019t wear them. Probably three-quarters of the things she buys me, I never wear.</p> \n<p>We\u2019re at a bit of an impasse, my wife and I. She hasn\u2019t stopped trying to smarten me up a bit and get me into some newer things, but I don\u2019t find those things comfortable. It is a long-running battle, but we have a laugh about it. Sometimes she will drag me into a clothing store, and within 30 seconds I want to walk out.</p> \n<p>I am not bothered about my appearance or anything like that. Clothes for me are about comfort. Occasionally I will look at other men and think: \u201cThat jumper looks nice. I wish I had something like it.\u201d But then I think that, even if I did have it, I would never wear it.</p> \n<p><em>Additional reporting by Laura Kay</em></p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 12 March 2020 because Athena Drakou became an accountant before she moved to the UK, not after she moved as an earlier version said.</p>",

Most of us know by now that these are tactics used by predominantly white people to avoid engaging in genuine and meaningful dialogue about race-based issues, and to further uphold systems of oppression that white communities continue to benefit from.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/01/its-black-and-white-racism-in-australia-is-common-and-accepted\">It's black and white: racism in Australia is common and accepted | Marni Tuala for IndigenousX</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What we don\u2019t talk about enough though is how these types of responses are also unconsciously grounded in a psychological concept known as \u201cgaslighting\u201d, as well as the collateral damage that occurs in the minds of black and brown people as a result of this type of avoidance and delusion.</p> <p>Gaslighting, which is a concept that was popularised by a theatrical play called Gas Light in 1938, is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>to manipulate (someone) by psychological means into doubting their own sanity\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>As Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people, just how many times have we walked away from an encounter with a racially resentful white person, who has just spent the majority of their time denying our experiences as people, and left reeling from the blatant ignorance, contempt and neglect of our humanity and right to exist?</p> <p>Or how many times have we thought to ourselves, \u201cThis person is clearly harbouring racist attitudes, but they are doing their absolute best to convince me that they are \u2018the least racist person you could ever know\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>One of the key objectives for those in possession of this type of gaslighting mentality is to destabilise a person or party, and then ultimately lead them to creating a distinct lack of trust in their own thinking, their abilities, their judgment or their experiences, putting them in a position where they are continuously questioning their own reality.</p> <p>This can obviously have severe implications for our mental health, both individually and collectively.</p> <p>To be told that we \u201cjust need to toughen up\u201d or \u201cget over it\u201d, in relation to very open and unjustified racism is not OK. To be called racist for identifying<em> actual</em> racist behaviours and rhetoric is not OK. To be told that racism is all in our heads and that everybody is human, despite the plethora of First Nations people who are not treated as such by society, is not OK.</p> <p>These white \u201cinnocents\u201d \u2013 as James Baldwin called them \u2013 are planting seeds of uncertainty in their victims, striving for power and revelling in their domination and control over others.

  "<p><em><br></em>The Greek government has been warned by the EU executive that it must uphold the right to asylum, as leaders from Brussels travel to Athens for talks on the migrant crisis at the EU\u2019s borders.</p> <p>Ylva Johansson, EU commissioner for home affairs, said she wanted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/turkey-erdogan-holds-talks-with-eu-leaders-over-border-opening\">discuss a detention centre</a> where asylum seekers were reported to have been captured and beaten, before being expelled from Greece without the chance to speak to a lawyer or claim asylum.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/world/europe/greece-migrants-secret-site.html\">New York Times reported on Tuesday of \u201ca black site\u201d</a> in north eastern Greece where migrants are held without legal recourse before being expelled to Turkey.</p> <p>Johansson, a Swedish social democrat who took charge of EU migration policy a little more than 100 days ago, said she would raise the issue of the detention centre with Greek government ministers on Thursday. </p> <p>\u201cThese kind of temporary detentions that they have set up \u2013 is one of the things I would like to know more about \u2026 Of course you can have detention for some period of people that have come, but of course you can\u2019t beat them,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The commission has been accused of failing to uphold EU law since Greece announced earlier this month it was suspending asylum applications for one month, a move at odds with European law and the Geneva convention.</p> <p>While the UN agency for refugees has said the Greek decision has no legal basis, the commission has said it needs time to assess the situation.</p> <p>Sidestepping whether Greece\u2019s decision was illegal, Johansson said: \u201cWe are going to discuss actually what they are doing, but they have to let people apply for asylum.\u201d</p> <p>She also said the commission did not plan to suspend the right to asylum by invoking a little-known clause of the EU treaty that allows Brussels to propose \u201cprovisional measures\u201d, to help a member state facing an emergency because of large numbers of migrant arrivals.</p> <p>Greece\u2019s prime minister Kyri\u00e1kos Mitsot\u00e1kis announced he was involving article 78.3 earlier this month when he said all asylum applications would be suspended. That measure requires a proposal from the commission that is agreed by EU member states.</p> <p>Johansson said the commission would not propose suspending the right to asylum. \u201cIndividuals in the European Union have the right to apply for asylum. This is in the treaty, this is in international law. This we can\u2019t suspend.\u201d</p> <p>The Swedish commissioner was due to be accompanied on the visit to Greece by the European commission president Ursula von der Leyen, who drew criticism from the left when she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/migration-eu-praises-greece-as-shield-after-turkey-opens-border\">described Greece as Europe\u2019s \u201cshield\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Von der Leyen later postponed her meeting with the Greek prime minister, in order to focus on the coronavirus.</p> <p>Speaking in the European parliament this week, the leader of the Socialists and Democrats, Iratxe Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez, said: \u201cShields are used to protect ourselves against weapons, but we are talking about the lives of vulnerable people, of human beings.\u201d The Spanish socialist also accused the commission of ignoring the Geneva convention.</p> <p>Tensions erupted earlier this month when Turkey opened its borders and began sending migrants towards the EU, creating a stand-off that adds to pressure on Greece, where thousands of refugees and migrants are living in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/lesbos-fears-repeat-of-2015-as-refugees-target-greek-island\">squalid camps on the islands.</a><br><br>The Swedish commissioner has pledged to revive a long-blocked reform of the EU asylum system. A 2016 attempt to overhaul European asylum law foundered in the wake of fierce opposition from Hungary, Poland and others opposed to mandatory quotas of refugees.</p> <p>Johansson said she favoured \u201ca mandatory solidarity mechanism\u201d but details of what that meant had still to be finalised. Previous attempts to find a compromise suggested that countries opposed to refugee quotas could pay money or offer equipment to states in need, but none failed to break the deadlock.</p> <p>The commissioner said she felt positive about finding a compromise. \u201cEverybody realises that [there is] a lack of a common European migration and asylum policy \u2013 we are paying a price for that and it shows right now with the crisis in Greece.\u201d</p>",

A number of passengers on Mello\u2019s Turkish Airlines flight left with him, waiting by the airline\u2019s counter for their luggage, some on hold with customer service. <br></p> <p>\u201cThere are just so many differentials that can happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there is one case (of coronavirus) in Turkey, but imagine in five days they find 400 people and then they say you have to stay 14 days in quarantine. It just wouldn\u2019t be great to go for five days and then end up stuck for 30 days.\u201d<br></p> <p>Reggie Chand, 34, and Esther Goundar, 32, were flying through Istanbul to Athens for a two-week trip to celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe got checked in, we got our boarding tickets from here to Turkey, from Turkey to Athens,\u201d Goundar said. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting in the lounge area and then I got a text message from my friend: \u2018Hey, are you going to get stuck in Europe?\u2019\u201d <br></p> <p>Chand and Goundar are American citizens. They did not know when they canceled the trip they had been planning since October that the ban did not apply to them, but looking back, they still think they made the right decision. \u201cIt\u2019s too much risk,\u201d Goundar said. \u201cEven if the vacation goes well, and we come back, either way you stay two weeks on vacation and then stay isolated for two weeks. It\u2019s too much.\u201d<br></p> <p>The couple felt a mixture of disappointment and anger over the whole ordeal -- Chand had been on hold with Turkish Airlines for more than an hour, looking to get a refund for their tickets. <br></p> <p>\u201cI am kind of mad,\u201d Chand said. \u201cHe could have said, OK you have two days or three days, or I\u2019m going to talk to airlines so you can have something planned so nobody is stuck in Europe. What if we had gone and we were now stuck there?\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cThat would have pissed me off,\u201d Goundar said. \u201cIf we were already on the flight and we were told you cannot go home for the next 29 days, we would not have enjoyed our vacation.\u201d<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e69af688f08c2df6d277ffe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T03:44:13.733Z\">3.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The president apparently misstated a number of things</strong> during his televised address.

As a result, the campaign is arguing that it\u2019s \u201cnearly impossible\u201d for Vermont senator Bernie Sanders to catch up to Biden\u2019s delegate lead. </p> <p>That\u2019s according to an internal campaign memo obtained by The Guardian. The memo comes a day after Biden trounced Sanders in the latest round of Democratic primary contests on Tuesday. </p> <p>\u201cVotes are still being counted, but it appears that we will net somewhere around 70-80 delegates from March 10 contests alone,\u201d the memo reads. \u201cFor context, on a day we expected would be the toughest day for us in the March calendar, we netted approximately the same number of delegates that we netted on Super Tuesday. This brings our total projected delegate lead to approximately 160.\u201d</p> <p>Sanders\u2019 path forward is precarious. He trails Biden by over 150 delegates. Biden beat Sanders in Michigan on Tuesday, the most delegate-rich state of the six and one that Sanders surprisingly won in 2016. Sanders in a press conference on Wednesday said he planned to still stay in the race but conceded the path is difficult for him. In a fundraising email to supporters, Sanders said: \u201cwe are winning \u2014 very clearly \u2014 the ideological debate, we are losing, right now, the electability debate.\u201d</p> <p>According to the memo, the Biden campaign sees the next few states as advantageous for the former vice president. \u201cThe states that vote next - Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, and Georgia - have been some of our strongest, and we expect to significantly expand our delegate lead in those highly-supportive, delegate-rich states. Of 682 delegates awarded in those states, conservative estimates have us winning more than 400 delegates and netting more than 150 delegates.\u201d</p> <p>The memo concludes: \u201cShould our broad base of support remain - and we have seen no signs that would indicate otherwise - it will be nearly impossible for Sanders to recoup his current delegate disadvantage.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e69714b8f08c2df6d277e76\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-11T23:19:58.485Z\">11.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It\u2019s unclear what, exactly, Donald Trump will say when he addresses the coronavirus threat tonight.

That still appears to be broadly true: but at least according to this poll, up close, the picture is a bit more complex. <br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-11T21:34:27.754Z\">at 9.34pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e6954ee8f087df56e4c6d49\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-11T21:20:56.211Z\">9.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hi there, it\u2019s <strong>Maanvi Singh</strong> taking over from the West Coast. </p> <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> is expected to announce an executive order that insists on the use of American made medical supplies in response to the coronavirus outbreak, according to the AP.

But they didn\u2019t agree that the Vermont senator is their best bet to beat Donald Trump. The establishment didn\u2019t lock Bernie out. Black voters across the south made the pragmatic decision that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> is the man to unseat the US president. A broad coalition of voters, from suburban women to white men without a college degree, took their cue from South Carolina and flocked around Biden. It was a flood on Tuesday. Florida and Georgia are ready to pile on the bandwagon.</p> <p>Turnout is up across the nation, especially in Michigan, where Biden and not Sanders is the beneficiary. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democrats</a> are declaring they cannot tolerate any more Trump. They believe Biden can manage a panic. The wave has laid Sanders asunder.

Getting Donald Trump out of office, which is why, I suspect, primary voters went for what they see as the safe choice instead of the candidate promising free healthcare, free college, free puppies and pizza every Friday (and who\u2019s going to pay for it? Billionaires!). That, or young people were too busy making TikToks to show up.</p> <p>What I\u2019m curious about is what comes next: will the legions of young people who knocked on doors and memed their hearts out for Sanders become so disillusioned by the Democratic party that they sit out the general election, write in Bernie Sanders, lodge a protest vote for Trump or leave the party altogether?

In fact, some of the most questionable decisions of his 2020 campaign \u2013 doing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/16/bernie-sanders-draws-enthusiastic-cheers-in-surprising-fox-news-town-hall\">Fox News Town Hall</a> and touting a <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/blog/meet-press-blog-latest-news-analysis-data-driving-political-discussion-n988541/ncrd1123066#blogHeader\">controversial endorsement</a> by Joe Rogan \u2013 were based on the rationale that Sanders alone could win back white working-class voters who had abandoned the Democratic party for Trump.</p> <p>Despite trailing in the polls by <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1153246\">25%</a>, he had eked out a narrow but significant win over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 primaries.

His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/10/democratic-primaries-joe-biden-bernie-sanders\">loss to Joe Biden</a> might not shake the belief of Sanders and his supporters that he, and he alone, can defeat Trump in November, but it most likely does end his chance at winning the Democratic nomination.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7876bf7b6e72be13cbb23e887757d43718991067\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7876bf7b6e72be13cbb23e887757d43718991067/0_232_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders takes part in a FOX News Town Hall with co-moderators Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., March 9, 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders takes part in a FOX News Town Hall with co-moderators Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., March 9, 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This should not really have come as a surprise. Despite all the hype after the first three primaries, in wildly unrepresentative and largely irrelevant states, Sanders was winning by pluralities between one-quarter and one-third of the vote. In several cases his support was only half that of 2016, suggesting his surprise success last time was as much anti-Clinton protest as pro-Sanders support. Even when the field started to thin, Sanders only won a majority in his home state of Vermont, and only barely so.</p> <p>While Super Tuesday was brutal for the large size of the Biden wins, the modest Sanders wins were equally telling. Despite massive campaigning efforts in terms of both money and personnel and very favorable poll numbers for weeks, Sanders won just 34% of the vote in California. Biden, who had barely campaigned in the Golden State, came second with 27%, just seven points behind.</p> <p>Read the full piece:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/10/why-bernie-sanders-lost-michigan\">Why Bernie Sanders lost Michigan \u2013 and what it means for his campaign | Cas Mudde</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e68ea8c8f087df56e4c6778\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-11T13:47:53.821Z\">1.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6418fc535385d4f9d1cb31c6c5b6f3305ca286e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6418fc535385d4f9d1cb31c6c5b6f3305ca286e/0_133_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supporters of Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden attend a campaign rally at Renaissance High School in Detroit, Michigan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters of Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden attend a campaign rally at Renaissance High School in Detroit, Michigan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Kowalsky/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cc3c850ab6376882e40f5411cc896ddc4e1a21d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cc3c850ab6376882e40f5411cc896ddc4e1a21d/0_0_4377_2626/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Huntington Center is seen empty after Democratic presidential candidate Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders cancels his rally planned in Cleveland, Ohio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Huntington Center is seen empty after Democratic presidential candidate Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders cancels his rally planned in Cleveland, Ohio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Megan Jelinger/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5fcb6c5d18cb1f45ad6032a3e6e449bd1dbb053\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5fcb6c5d18cb1f45ad6032a3e6e449bd1dbb053/0_280_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Democratic presidential hopeful former Vice President Joe Biden speaks, flanked by his wife Jill Biden, at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Democratic presidential hopeful former Vice President Joe Biden speaks, flanked by his wife Jill Biden, at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae97aced02c4960ba40596cf511002a6e4e1f4a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae97aced02c4960ba40596cf511002a6e4e1f4a6/0_195_5845_3507/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Volunteers take down a rally stage for Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden in Cleveland, Ohio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Volunteers take down a rally stage for Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden in Cleveland, Ohio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Megan Jelinger/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e68e8668f087df56e4c6764\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/tom-perkins\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-11T13:36:17.574Z\">1.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">'Hard to comprehend\u2019: Sanders\u2019 loss in Michigan crushes staff and supporters</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In the days leading up to a must-win Tuesday Michigan primary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders\">Bernie Sanders</a> criss-crossed the state, firing up thousands of supporters and taking the stage with star surrogates in a bid to repeat his momentum-shifting 2016 upset of Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>As the polls closed, it seemed to some that a surprise win might not be out of the question.

The next major slate of primaries is on March 17, and includes Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio. </p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/fl/florida_democratic_presidential_primary-6847.html\">Florida</a>, Biden is 42.5 points ahead of his rival in polling averages, while recent polling in <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/az/arizona_democratic_primary-6898.html\">Arizona</a> shows Biden at +28. Sanders lost all four states to Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p> <p>But Sanders seems unlikely to go quietly \u2013 despite his decision not to speak after the results last night. His campaign said last night that he fully intended to take on Biden in Sunday\u2019s debate in Arizona, and he still has a fiercely loyal support base, especially among the young and Latinos. </p> <p>In 2016, his decision to stay in the race all the way to the bitter end \u2013 only endorsing Clinton in July of that year \u2013 was perceived by many of his supporters as helping push Clinton\u2019s platform to the left, for example on healthcare. He may well aim to do the same with Biden this year. </p> <p>Clinton supporters, of course, bitterly resent the fact Sanders stayed in the race so long, believing it weakened her in the general election, perhaps crucially. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"301d04393146ab86f669a693fd827b20d8a79fb2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/301d04393146ab86f669a693fd827b20d8a79fb2/91_0_2839_1703/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders: mulling next moves.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders: mulling next moves.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Sancya/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e68c2418f08c2df6d277546\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-11T10:50:36.469Z\">10.50am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Donald Trump\u2019s response to last night\u2019s primary results seemed a little off the pace, continuing to blame Elizabeth Warren for Bernie Sanders\u2019 defeats:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1237603152490147850\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Pocahontas, working in conjunction with the Democrat Party, totally destroyed the campaign of Bernie Sanders.

At least, not yet.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt this point in time, today [12 March], the risk of getting it in the community is still very low,\u201d Collignon told Guardian Australia. \u201cThat may be different next week or the week after. My advice to people today is, there are risks from isolation too.\u201d</p> \n<p>Australia has, so far, had very low rates of community transmission, Collignon says. Strategies of detection and containment broadly appear to be working. If that changes, a more aggressive approach to containment may be warranted.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt the moment the risk here is much lower than if you lived in Italy,\u201d Collignon says.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat may change in a week or in three weeks time. But it\u2019s not reasonable for people to become hermits for the next year. We don\u2019t know how long this is going to persist.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is possible, says Collignon, that the virus will not peak in Australia until the winter flu season.</p> \n<p>He says people should continue to go about their lives with a reasonable level of precaution, proportionate to the current risk. If a person is in an at-risk group, or caring for someone who is, he says they can practice social distancing rather than going into full home isolation.</p> \n<h2><strong>What is social distancing?</strong></h2> \n<p>Social distancing is one step back from home isolation. It means you avoid gathering where there are likely to be large groups of people, stand at least one metre away from people who are showing signs of being sick or who have recently travelled overseas, and generally pull back on non-essential mingling.</p> \n<p>Both the Victorian and New South Wales governments have indicated they might move to cancel mass gatherings, or close schools, if the spread of community transmission necessitates those kind of containment measures.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-australia-labor-calls-for-mass-events-to-be-cancelled-and-schools-closed\">Coronavirus Australia: Labor calls for mass events to be cancelled and schools closed</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The most important advice for people who face a higher risk of a serious illness from Covid-19, and people caring for others in those groups, is to wash their hands frequently and distance yourself if you become sick.</p> \n<h2><strong>Surely it\u2019s about more than washing your hands?</strong></h2> \n<p>When it comes to protecting people from getting the virus, washing your hands (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/02/how-to-wash-your-hands-properly\">with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds</a>) and not coughing or sneezing on people is the best defence.</p> \n<p>Collignon says if you are in a vulnerable group or caring for someone who is, the most important advice is to wash your hands frequently and clean any surfaces they might tough with a disinfectant that kills viruses, like an alcohol wipe.</p> \n<p>If you are unwell \u2013 whether your illness is confirmed to be Covid-19 or not \u2013 stay at least one metre away from people and ensure the vulnerable person has a separate bedroom and bathroom, if possible.</p> \n<p>Another way to protect vulnerable people in the community is to ensure that healthy people do not overwhelm the public health system.</p> \n<h2><strong>Unless you have been overseas or in contact with someone, you do not need a test for Covid-19</strong></h2> \n<p>To date Australia has kept on top of demand for testing of Covid-19, Collignon says.</p> \n<p>Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/10/coronavirus-update-latest-italy-shutdown-lockdown-who-pandemic-outbreak-quarantine-uk-cases-usa-america-australia-live-news-updates?page=with:block-5e6824b78f087df56e4c61ad#block-5e6824b78f087df56e4c61ad\">said this week</a> that there had been a number of people seeking testing for Covid-19 who did not need to be tested and that was \u201cputting an unnecessary burden\u201d on the health system.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-facts-cure-mortality-rate-virus-covid-19-flu\">Coronavirus facts: is there a cure and what is the mortality rate of the virus?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Murphy says the only people who need to be tested are people with cold or flu-like symptoms who have travelled overseas within the past 14 days, or been in contact with a confirmed case in the past 14 days.</p> \n<p>He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/10/coronavirus-update-latest-italy-shutdown-lockdown-who-pandemic-outbreak-quarantine-uk-cases-usa-america-australia-live-news-updates?page=with:block-5e6829d28f087df56e4c61e7#block-5e6829d28f087df56e4c61e7\">there was \u201cno value\u201d in testing people who do not have respiratory symptoms</a> because that could produce a false negative result.</p> \n<p>Unless rates of community transmission accelerate in Australia, testing people outside that narrow group for Covid-19 is an unnecessary clog on the system, Collignon says.

  "<p>\u201cMy fellow Americans: Tonight, I want to speak with you about our nation\u2019s unprecedented response to the coronavirus outbreak that started in China and is now spreading throughout the world.</p> \n<p>Today, the World Health Organization officially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/who-declares-coronavirus-pandemic\">announced that this is a global pandemic.</a></p> \n<p>We have been in frequent contact with our allies, and we are marshalling the full power of the federal government and the private sector to protect the American people.</p> \n<p>This is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history. I am confident that by counting and continuing to take these tough measures, we will significantly reduce the threat to our citizens, and we will ultimately and expeditiously defeat this virus.</p> \n<p>From the beginning of time, nations and people have faced unforeseen challenges, including large-scale and very dangerous health threats. This is the way it always was and always will be. It only matters how you respond, and we are responding with great speed and professionalism.</p> \n<p>Our team is the best anywhere in the world. At the very start of the outbreak, we instituted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/04/coronavirus-us-quarantine-travel-ban-response\">sweeping travel restrictions on China</a> and put in place the first federally mandated quarantine in over 50 years. We declared a public health emergency and issued the highest level of travel warning on other countries as the virus spread its horrible infection.</p> \n<p>And taking early intense action, we have seen dramatically fewer cases of the virus in the United States than are now present in Europe. <br> The European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hotspots. As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travellers from Europe.</p> \n<p>After consulting with our top government health professionals, I have decided to take several strong but necessary actions to protect the health and wellbeing of all Americans.</p> \n<p>To keep new cases from entering our shores, we will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days. The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight. These restrictions will be adjusted subject to conditions on the ground.</p> \n<p>There will be exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings, and these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval. Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing. These restrictions will also not apply to the United Kingdom.</p> \n<p>At the same time, we are monitoring the situation in China and in South Korea. And, as their situation improves, we will re-evaluate the restrictions and warnings that are currently in place for a possible early opening.</p> \n<p>Earlier this week, I met with the leaders of health insurance industry who have agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments, extend insurance coverage to these treatments, and to prevent surprise medical billing.</p> \n<p>We are cutting massive amounts of red tape to make antiviral therapies available in record time. These treatments will significantly reduce the impact and reach of the virus.</p> \n<p>Additionally, last week, I signed into law an $8.3bn funding bill to help CDC and other government agencies fight the virus and support vaccines, treatments, and distribution of medical supplies. Testing and testing capabilities are expanding rapidly, day by day. We are moving very quickly.</p> \n<p>(For) The vast majority of Americans: the risk is very, very low. Young and healthy people can expect to recover fully and quickly if they should get the virus. The highest risk is for elderly population with underlying health conditions. The elderly population must be very, very careful.</p> \n<p>In particular, we are strongly advising that nursing homes for the elderly suspend all medically unnecessary visits. In general, older Americans should also avoid nonessential travel in crowded areas.</p> \n<p>My administration is co-ordinating directly with communities with the largest outbreaks, and we have issued guidance on school closures, social distancing, and reducing large gatherings.</p> \n<p>Smart action today will prevent the spread of the virus tomorrow.</p> \n<p>Every community faces different risks and it is critical for you to follow the guidelines of your local officials who are working closely with our federal health experts \u2013 and they are the best.</p> \n<p>For all Americans, it is essential that everyone take extra precautions and practise good hygiene. Each of us has a role to play in defeating this virus. Wash your hands, clean often-used surfaces, cover your face and mouth if you sneeze or cough, and most of all, if you are sick or not feeling well, stay home.</p> \n<p>To ensure that working Americans impacted by the virus can stay home without fear of financial hardship, I will soon be taking emergency action, which is unprecedented, to provide financial relief. This will be targeted for workers who are ill, quarantined, or caring for others due to coronavirus.</p> \n<p>I will be asking Congress to take legislative action to extend this relief.</p> \n<p>Because of the economic policies that we have put into place over the last three years, we have the greatest economy anywhere in the world, by far.</p> \n<p>Our banks and financial institutions are fully capitalized and incredibly strong. Our unemployment is at a historic low. This vast economic prosperity gives us flexibility, reserves, and resources to handle any threat that comes our way.</p> \n<p>This is not a financial crisis, this is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as a nation and as a world.</p> \n<p>However, to provide extra support for American workers, families, and businesses, tonight I am announcing the following additional actions: I am instructing the Small Business Administration to exercise available authority to provide capital and liquidity to firms affected by the coronavirus.</p> \n<p>Effective immediately, the SBA will begin providing economic loans in affected states and territories. These low-interest loans will help small businesses overcome temporary economic disruptions caused by the virus. To this end, I am asking Congress to increase funding for this program by an additional $50bn.</p> \n<p>Using emergency authority, I will be instructing the Treasury Department to defer tax payments, without interest or penalties, for certain individuals and businesses negatively impacted. This action will provide more than $200bn of additional liquidity to the economy.</p> \n<p>Finally, I am calling on Congress to provide Americans with immediate payroll tax relief. Hopefully they will consider this very strongly.</p> \n<p>We are at a critical time in the fight against the virus. We made a life-saving move with early action on China. Now we must take the same action with Europe. We will not delay. I will never hesitate to take any necessary steps to protect the lives, health, and safety of the American people. I will always put the wellbeing of America first.</p> \n<p>If we are vigilant \u2013 and we can reduce the chance of infection, which we will \u2013 we will significantly impede the transmission of the virus. The virus will not have a chance against us.</p> \n<p>No nation is more prepared or more resilient than the United States. We have the best economy, the most advanced healthcare, and the most talented doctors, scientists, and researchers anywhere in the world.</p> \n<p>We are all in this together. We must put politics aside, stop the partisanship, and unify together as one nation and one family.</p> \n<p>As history has proven time and time again, Americans always rise to the challenge and overcome adversity.</p> \n<p>Our future remains brighter than anyone can imagine. Acting with compassion and love, we will heal the sick, care for those in need, help our fellow citizens, and emerge from this challenge stronger and more unified than ever before.</p> \n<p>God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Midway through this second leg, as the black shirts fell back into their carefully-stitched patterns, as Liverpool\u2019s players struggled a little in their familiar home spaces, it was hard to avoid the feeling of a pair of hands reaching almost imperceptibly for the lapels, the clavicle, and finally the throat. This was a beautifully controlled strangulation, enacted in plain sight by Diego Simeone\u2019s Atl\u00e9tico Madrid.</p> \n<p>But it was also a heist, a rearguard victory during which the Atl\u00e9tico goal seemed to be protected by some invisible membrane, sealed within a kind of high-strength footballing clingfilm.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/11/liverpool-atlletico-madrid-champions-league-last-16-second-leg-match-report\">Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Llorente stun Anfield to end Liverpool's reign</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Even the details of their 3-2 win at Anfield made little sense. Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix had touched the ball 22 times by the time this game reached the seventh minute of extra time, with the score 2-0 to Liverpool.</p> \n<p>Through all this F\u00e9lix had mooched. He\u2019d looked sad. He\u2019d bounced off defenders, and generally played like \u00a3110m of slouchy teenager. F\u00e9lix, who loves to pass, had completed 18 passes. At which point he played the pass that killed this tie, all but eliminated the champions of Europe, and helped produce the key stroke in a slow-burn, slightly mind-bending piece of floodlit robbery .</p> \n<p>Out of nowhere Adri\u00e1n played a horrible defensive clearance straight to F\u00e9lix\u2019s feet. At which point F\u00e9lix became a shark, playing a lovely no-look pass that left Marcos Llorente in space in front of goal. His shot was low and hard into the corner. Anfield fell quiet for the first time on the night, the hush broken by the gathering roars of the away corner.</p> \n<p>Make no mistake this was not a masterful rearguard. It was not some sublime act of defensive nihilism. Instead it was an act of hanging on by your fingernails. Liverpool had 35 shots at goal. Has anyone ever had 35 shots and been knocked out of a cup competition? Trent Alexander-Arnold crossed the ball 25 times. Has anyone ever done this, crossed the ball 25 times and still lost?</p> \n<p>If this wasn\u2019t a heist it was something else, a mystery. Time and again at Anfield Liverpool seemed to be close to wrenching the night their way. Time and again, something else happened instead. How do you win a game this many times, find the space, the moment, the opening, but still manage to lose it?</p> \n<p>Perhaps the Atl\u00e9tico aura played a part. There had been a sense before tonight of mild overkill, a feeling the surrounding noise had turned Atl\u00e9tico into something monsterish, a bunch of footballing Visigoths here to wipe their great muddy boots on the Axminster. In reality Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s only away Champions League clean sheets in the last two seasons have come against Lokomotiv Moscow and Club Brugge.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67da5416adb95dba5e3b74c3591d013f6becda32\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67da5416adb95dba5e3b74c3591d013f6becda32/0_139_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix tries to progress despite the close attention of Liverpool\u2019s Jordan Henderson and Georginio Wijnaldum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix tries to progress despite the close attention of Liverpool\u2019s Jordan Henderson and Georginio Wijnaldum.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Recine/Action Images via Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Still, though, they carried a sense of defiance here. At kick-off Anfield had been alive with that familiar sense of event-glamour before kick-off, the low white lights on the lip of the stand picking out the driving rain. Jordan Henderson was back in the midfield three. Up front for Atl\u00e9tico F\u00e9lix was in the company of Beowulf himself, the terrible Diego Costa, who did nothing here in his 55 minutes except mutter constantly in the ear of the referee..</p> \n<p>But then Atl\u00e9tico are unlike any other opponent in European football. This is football played through a heavy fog: hang-over football, an activity designed to send a knot of pain throbbing across your temples.

Renan Lodi struggled to keep Mo Salah under control. Liverpool took the lead through Gigi Wijnaldum\u2019s wonderful header. But they couldn\u2019t score again. Jan Oblak, who had an astonishing game, seemed to be playing through a haze of destiny.

There is a kind of poetry in this type of performance and this kind of result, the fact that elite level club football can still produce such a profound contrast of styles and fortunes</p> \n<p>And so that run is over. Goodbye to all that for another year, to Allez Allez Allez, to those red-shirted away days, to the feeling that J\u00fcrgen Klopp really does have his own kind of magic in this competition. There were fine performances all over the pitch. Wijnaldum had a quietly majestic game. Alexander-Arnold was sublime again. Salah just kept running and really could have scored four. For now we\u2019ll always have Madrid, Rome, Barcelona \u2013 and now the heist of Anfield, a night when Liverpool really did throw everything into their own extended farewell.</p>",
  "<p>Paisley Park seems set to be a hot favourite for a second consecutive success in the Stayers Hurdle, having kept his unbeaten record since then. So punters must ask themselves, is the eight-year-old as solid as Envoi Allen or fallible like Defi Du Seuil?</p> \n<p>He has looked more straightforward this year but this is his toughest test since last year\u2019s Festival and it is disconcerting to see the strike-rate of Emma Lavelle\u2019s yard has been declining since the heady days of November. With a fascinating cast of characters in opposition, it is very tempting to look elsewhere.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/11/tiger-roll-lost-roar-cheltenham-fesitval-2020-grand-national\">Tame Cheltenham run suggests Tiger Roll has lost his Grand National roar</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>City Island (3.30)</strong> is the suggestion, as double-figure odds underestimate the horse who beat Champ in last year\u2019s Ballymore. Chasing has not worked out well for him this season but he did enough last time to indicate the ability is still there, now that he switches back to the smaller obstacles after a wind op.</p> \n<p>L\u2019Ami Serge easily has the ability to take this if so minded but snatched defeat from the jaws of victory at Ascot in December, which is hard to forgive.

Unbeaten in his first three over fences, he has proved that his engine is still really powerful and he is fancied to outgun the progressive Itchy Feet, half his age.</p> \n<p><strong>2.10 Pertemps Final Hurdle</strong> Being sent <strong>Relegate</strong> was a fine reward for Colm Murphy, after he decided to return to training. The mare flew home to win the 2018 Bumper when with Willie Mullins and showed plenty of promise when a staying-on fourth in the Punchestown qualifier last month. She\u2019s nicely treated though dangers abound, notably Third Wind.</p> \n<p><strong>2.50 Ryanair Chase</strong> Bryony Frost judged the fractions perfectly on Frodon last year and will need to get it bang right again for the horse to have a chance of repeating that success. A more plausible outcome is that <strong>A Plus Tard</strong> will stay on past him up the hill, an incline which he seemed to relish in landing a handicap here last year.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/11/j-p-mcmanus-rues-one-that-got-away-on-a-remarkable-day-at-cheltenham-festival-horse-racing\">J P McManus rues one that got away on a remarkable day at Cheltenham</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>4.10 Brown Advisory Plate Chase</strong> The strongest form belongs to <strong>Simply The Betts</strong>, a game winner here in January.

  "<p>Women and girls face a \u201cgrowing crisis\u201d of online harms, with sexual harassment, threatening messages and discrimination making the web an unsafe place to be, Sir Tim Berners-Lee has warned.</p> <p>The inventor of the world wide web said the \u201cdangerous trend\u201d in online abuse was forcing women out of jobs, causing girls to skip school, damaging relationships and silencing female opinions, prompting him to conclude that \u201cthe web is not working for women and girls\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe world has made important progress on gender equality thanks to the unceasing drive of committed champions everywhere,\u201d Berners-Lee wrote in an open letter to mark the web\u2019s 31st birthday on Thursday. \u201cBut I am seriously concerned that online harms facing women and girls \u2013 especially those of colour, from LGBTQ+ communities and other marginalised groups \u2013 threaten that progress.\u201d</p> <p>The warning comes a year after Berners-Lee launched the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/24/tim-berners-lee-unveils-global-plan-to-save-the-internet\">Contract for the Web</a>, a global action plan to save the web from forces that threaten to drag the world into a \u201cdigital dystopia\u201d. Without tackling misogynistic online abuse, the aims of the contract cannot be achieved, he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s up to all of us to make the web work for everyone,\u201d the letter states. \u201cThat requires the attention of all those who shape technology, from CEOs and engineers to academics and public officials.\u201d</p> <p>Berners-Lee highlights three areas that need \u201curgent\u201d attention. First is the digital divide that keeps <a href=\"https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/facts/default.aspx\">more than half of the world\u2019s women offline</a>, largely because it is too expensive, or they do not have access to the equipment or skills to use it.</p> <p>Second is online safety: according to a survey by Berners-Lee\u2019s Web Foundation, more than half of young women have experienced violence online, including sexual harassment, threatening messages and having private images shared without consent. The vast majority believe the problem is getting worse.</p> <p>The third threat comes from badly designed artificial intelligence systems that repeat and exacerbate discrimination. \u201cMany companies are working hard to tackle this discrimination. But unless they dedicate resources and diversify teams to mitigate bias, they risk expanding discrimination at a speed and scale never seen before,\u201d he writes.</p> <p>Amalia Toledo, a lawyer and activist at Fundaci\u00f3n Karisma, a Colombia-based group that lobbies for a safer internet, said that women\u2019s rights defenders and female journalists were targeted for abuse more than most.</p> <p>\u201cIf they are talking about issues that are pressing in the country, questioning the status quo, or denouncing what the state is doing, they will receive a lot of attacks, and there are more and more coordinated attacks from trolls, attacking their bodies, their families or relationships, and insulting how they look,\u201d said Toledo. \u201cTheir opinions are not even discussed.\u201d</p> <p>Fundaci\u00f3n Karisma runs an online campaign, \u201cAlerta Machitroll\u201d, which calls out misogynistic attitudes and abuse online. \u201cWhat victims are told all the time is \u2018Oh, that\u2019s nothing, ignore it, or close your account. But this has a big impact on people\u2019s lives. They want to control women, they want women to be silent,\u201d Toledo said.</p> <p>Berners-Lee said the coronavirus outbreak showed how urgent it was to take action. As workplaces and schools are forced to close, the web should be a \u201clifeline\u201d that allows people to keep working and children to be educated.</p> <p>He called on companies and governments to tackle online abuse as a top priority this year. More data needs to be collected and published on women\u2019s experiences online, while products, polices and services should all be designed based on data and feedback from women of all backgrounds, he said.</p> <p>Finally, he urged governments to strengthen laws that hold online abusers to account, and the public to speak up whenever they witnessed abuse online.</p> <p>Andy Burrows, head of child safety online policy at the NSPCC, said: \u201cTech firms are not neutral actors, and their decisions have real-world consequences. But for too long we\u2019ve seen a piecemeal and often insufficient response from platforms that put users in harm\u2019s way.\u201d</p>"
