That has led to international criticism and wounded national pride, writes Gina Gustavsson, an academic at Uppsala University. She asks: has Sweden\u2019s coronavirus strategy played into the hands of nationalists?</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Sweden has persisted with the strategy of coronavirus mitigation that the UK government eventually abandoned in March. The policy is widely supported by the public, even though the Swedish Covid-19 <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality\">mortality rate</a> is among the 10 highest in the world, at <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/\">240 per million</a> population and steadily rising, and many of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/anger-in-sweden-as-elderly-pay-price-for-coronavirus-strategy\">nursing homes</a> in Stockholm are now affected.</p> \n   <p>The typical explanation for this continued public support is that Swedes are trusting and unflappable. The country\u2019s chief epidemiologist, <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-swedish-epidemiologist-anders-tegnell-the-target-of-praise-criticism/\">Anders Tegnell</a>, the public face of the Swedish response to the pandemic, is after all a dry scientist-turned-bureaucrat, not some populist politician trying to whip up nationalist go-it-alone emotion.</p> \n   <p>But beneath the surface, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/sweden\">Sweden</a> is anything but calm. The public debate is inflamed with a sense of wounded national pride. As a believer in the kind of liberal nationalism that encourages self-critical national attachment, this pains me. But as a scholar of nationalism, I recognise the pattern. This is what Isaiah Berlin called the nationalism of \u201cthe bent twig\u201d, which lashes out against anyone who steps on it.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/may/01/sweden-coronavirus-strategy-nationalists-britain\">Has Sweden's coronavirus strategy played into the hands of nationalists? | Gina Gustavsson</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-01T12:32:30.633Z\">at 1.32pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eac0f1a8f0806a479811466\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-01T12:05:00.045Z\">1.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Thousands of Indian students unable to leave the <strong>UK</strong> because of the coronavirus lockdown are relying on food donations from charities because they can no longer afford to eat, <strong>Anna Fazackerly</strong> reports for the Guardian.</p> \n  <p>Student groups representing the students, from across Britain, have been coordinating emergency food drops with local community groups and charities.

There were plenty of \u201cI don\u2019t want to get ahead of the president\u201d deflections. As for policy depth, which is what the briefings are meant be about, that remains to be seen.</p> <p>Kurt Bardella, a political commentator, tweeted: \u201cObjectively @kayleighmcenany is doing the best job (so far) at the podium for @realDonaldTrump than anyone else who has served as @PressSec ... her experience on cable news makes her a far more seasoned spokesperson than her predecessors.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/trump-michigan-protesters-gretchen-whitmer\">Michigan: Trump says Whitmer should 'make a deal' with protesters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>From the Trump team\u2019s point of view, Bardella added, \u201cshe is poised, capable, on-message, in-command, prepares and a very effective communicator\u201d.</p> <p>Mark Meadows, the new White House chief of staff who has shaken up the communications operation, will probably be pleased.

  "<p>Listeners could be forgiven for a sense of deja vu: \u201cIt\u2019s going to go. It\u2019s going to leave. It\u2019s going to be gone,\u201d Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/apr/30/trump-says-coronavirus-will-be-eradicated-as-us-death-toll-passes-60000-video\" title=\"\">pronounced</a> of coronavirus on Wednesday.</p> <p>The words were eerily similar to the president\u2019s prediction in late February that \u201cIt\u2019s going to disappear\u201d \u2013 a theme he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/04/28/yet-again-trump-pledges-that-coronavirus-will-simply-go-away/\" title=\"\">harped on repeatedly</a> as the caseload and fatalities rose. Since that forecast, a million Americans have fallen ill with coronavirus \u2013 almost a third of the global total \u2013 and more than 60,000 have died, in just a few weeks surpassing the US death toll in all the years of the Vietnam war. This week, it was reported that almost 70 people had died at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/coronavirus-massachusetts-veterans-outbreak-holyoke-soldiers-home\" title=\"\">single veterans\u2019 nursing home</a> in Massachusetts. New York is struggling to bury its dead.</p> <p>This is what the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, describes as \u201ca great success story\u201d. This is the context in which the administration is letting its physical distancing guidelines lapse, instead advising much less stringent measures.</p> <p>Mr Kushner suggests that by July the country could be \u201creally rocking again\u201d. But Americans will suffer from Mr Trump\u2019s keenness to get back to business, as if the pre-coronavirus state of affairs were still possible. Medical experts have already warned about the risks of another surge in cases. The question is whether states, cities, institutions and individuals can again mitigate the harm he is wreaking upon his country. Some may; others are leading his charge: in Georgia, such essential services as tattoo parlours and bowling alleys are once again plying their trade. Texas is allowing shops, cinemas, shopping malls and restaurants to reopen, albeit with restrictions on capacity. Without significant testing and tracing, it is evident where such decisions will lead.</p> <p>The best that can be said for Mr Trump\u2019s election-driven wishful thinking is that it is less immediately dangerous than his recent public musings that people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/trump-coronavirus-treatment-disinfectant\" title=\"\">might have injections of disinfectant</a> as a cure. Each week of the pandemic has brought new shame upon the president: he failed to equip his country and its health workers, to advocate physical distancing when it was desperately needed, or even to look like he was seriously concerned about the outbreak and its victims, preferring instead to boast about the ratings for his briefings.</p> <p>While leaders around the world enjoyed a surge in support as the pandemic took hold \u2013 the rally-around-the-flag effect \u2013 Mr Trump\u2019s appalling performance has finally taken a toll on his popularity. He had counted on a strong economy to see him back into office in November. But with more than 30 million US workers filing unemployment claims in the last six weeks \u2013 and economists suggesting that the real level of job losses could be far worse \u2013 his confidence has been shaken.</p> <p>This week it was reported that he had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/us/politics/trump-campaign-reelection-polls.html\" title=\"\">lashed out at his own campaign</a> after polls showed him trailing Joe Biden in crucial states and with older voters. With the Democrat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/29/joe-biden-sexual-assault-claim-democrats\" title=\"\">facing a sexual assault claim</a> and running a virtual campaign while Mr Trump commands daily airtime, it is clear that the president is doing the damage himself. He is seeking to shift the blame for the pandemic to the World Health Organization (having ignored its repeated warnings) and to China. On Thursday he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/donald-trump-coronavirus-chinese-lab-claim\" title=\"\">contradicted his own</a> director of national intelligence by claiming that he had seen evidence that the virus originated in a Wuhan laboratory; Trump officials have reportedly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/us/politics/trump-administration-intelligence-coronavirus-china.html\" title=\"\">leaned on the agencies</a> to find evidence to back the theory.</p> <p>This conduct too is unpleasantly familiar. His contempt for the truth; his determination to evade responsibility while holding the most powerful job in the world; his ignorance, his narcissism and the threat he poses to his country \u2013 all have become still more painfully evident through this crisis, but were clear before. Yet he has so far defied the laws of political gravity. Americans have paid dearly for Mr Trump\u2019s complacency, recklessness, irrationality and incompetence. But are they at last ready to make him pay?</p>",

Before Biden launched his campaign, eight women accused him of touching them or displaying affection in ways that made them uncomfortable. Reade was among them.</p> \n<p>She did not make her accusation of sexual assault until this year, when she told podcast host Katie Halper Biden allegedly pinned her against a wall and penetrated her with his fingers.

Those restaurants have temporarily closed, so they\u2019re no longer ordering what we specifically grow for them.</p> <p>I\u2019m in the same boat as every primary producer whose main business is restaurants.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/mar/27/ive-never-seen-it-like-this-why-vegetables-are-so-expensive-in-australia-at-the-moment\">'I\u2019ve never seen it like this': why vegetables are so expensive in Australia at the moment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now the world over, home cooks have direct access to previously hard to procure lobsters, prime cuts of reserved Wagyu, or tiger striped jungle peanuts. Things that are usually snapped up by chefs for their tasting menus.</p> <p>Never before has it been more fun to cook at home. The creative uses for some of the produce that I am seeing is refreshing, but some produce can be harder to use or use up, and leaves people completely stumped. </p> <p>Lots of online stores will allow you select the contents \u2013 but I urge you to support your local small-scale farmers and buy a grab-bag direct from them, as you will get the freshest seasonal produce with the proceeds going straight to the source. Besides, it\u2019s more fun that way. </p> <h2>When your box arrives \u2026</h2> <p> First, lay everything on your kitchen table or bench. Group the produce like for like: brassicas, lettuces, fruits, herbs, roots etc. Then do as chefs do: wrap them up appropriately for storage, don\u2019t wash anything unless you are ready to use it (as it will likely bruise or accelerate the decomposition of the vegetable), and do not pre-cut anything you won\u2019t use that day, as the more surface area something has, the faster it dries out. </p> <p>Wrap your herbs in a moist paper towel, and put anything with leaves into your crisper. Apples, grapes, squashes, cucumbers, leeks, fennel and anything you want crisp goes into the fridge. Pears and avocados depend on the stage of ripeness \u2013 if they\u2019re soft, put them into the fridge, otherwise leave them on the bench to ripen more.</p> <p>Citrus, bananas, pumpkins, onions, garlic and potatoes are best left out. If you want to speed up the ripening of bananas and avocados, pop them together in a paper bag \u2013 the natural ethanol released will work very well.</p> <p>Pull out pencil and paper and get planning your week\u2019s menu and larder staples. You may just find this becomes a highlight of your week, and perhaps the habit will even stick around when the restaurants start opening up again.</p> <h2>What to do when you have a whole lot of one thing?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"255fdc2a39cc69bd5af57450359d89410352349f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/255fdc2a39cc69bd5af57450359d89410352349f/0_1353_7676_4605/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A whole pumpkin, sliced up.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With pumpkins and sweet potatoes, once the season starts it seems to never end.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Matthews/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Fermenting: </strong>If you received a whole cabbage, unless you are a large family you won\u2019t finish it off in a week \u2013 so portion out what you can eat. With the rest, wash it, weigh it up, add 3% of the total weight in salt and get massaging. Let it sit for an hour and then drain excess liquid, put it in a sterilised glass jar and let it ferment on the kitchen bench until sour. Then refrigerate it \u2013 et voil\u00e0 sauerkraut. Date it so you know when it was made.</p> <p>The things that can be lacto fermented include but are not limited to: all manner of brassicas (bok choy, cabbage, rapini), carrots, parsnips, swedes, fennel bulbs, beetroot, celery, and even fruit like melon rinds and apples. Get inspired to include aromats like dried or fresh herbs, garlic, chillies, ginger, galangal, makrut lime leaves and even citrus peel.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/23/easy-autumn-recipe-brussels-sprout-chestnut-and-bacon-soup\">Easy autumn recipe: brussels sprout, chestnut and bacon soup</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Freezing: </strong>With pumpkins and sweet potatoes, once the season starts it seems to never end. There\u2019s a reason that grocers sell things by halves, like celery, watermelons and pumpkins. If you are going to cook with a pumpkin or sweet potato, don\u2019t just cut the wedge you plan on eating tonight. Cook and process the whole lot. By processing I mean steaming or roasting. Then portion it out into 250g servings and freeze it. Having these on hand means you can defrost to instantly make a soup, curry, warm salad, frittata or even make custard to fill a pie.</p> <p>Don\u2019t be afraid to freeze things; most defrost well enough, and need only a little warming in the oven before you can use them. Once it\u2019s been reheated, use it straight away as refreezing isn\u2019t a good idea.</p> <p>Things that can steamed or roasted, then frozen, include peppers, beetroot, carrots, potatoes, swedes, parsnips, onions (best roasted) and most root vegetables. I almost always roast veg with olive oil, grey salt and whole bulbs of garlic de-cloved. The rule is always low and slow. When you come to portion everything out, separate the excess oil and garlic cloves and put them into a jar. This will create a flavoured oil to use in salad dressing, or even for finishing off meats, soups and casseroles. Mashing the roasted garlic on toast is a particular delight.</p> <h2>I have mysterious leafy greens \u2026</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b71917f2a60e467d0cf3af87af1e72f92238e049\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b71917f2a60e467d0cf3af87af1e72f92238e049/0_103_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Different types of green vegetables in a stainless colanderDark green leafy vegetables in colander\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some greens need long slow cooking, some just a quick blanch and some are best eaten raw in a salad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elenathewise/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some greens need long slow cooking times, some need just a quick blanch or stir fry and some are just best left alone to eat raw in a salad.</p> <p><strong>Slow braising</strong></p> <p>Woodier greens like cavolo nero, silver beet, radish tops, the tops of any root veg, chicory, cardoons and artichokes (I know they\u2019re not leafy greens but still need to be mentioned) benefit from longer braising. This requires homemade stock or water and olive oil in a 3:1 ratio, plus salt and garlic. At the end of the long simmer, finish off with something acidic like vinegar or citrus. The time depends on the toughness of the leaves, but I find that anything needing a braise longer than 20-30 minutes isn\u2019t worth eating.</p> <p>This is a deliciously universal way of cooking vegetables that are a little woodier and benefit from being eaten on the softer side \u2013 do not be concerned if the greens turn olive or even brown. Brown food is delicious.</p> <p>Keep adjusting the liquid as you go, not allowing the greens to be swamped, and likewise not drying them out. I really like to finish off a longer braise like this with a contrast of something fresh in at the end, like freshly shelled or frozen peas and a generous fistful of chopped fresh herbs \u2013 like flat-leafed parsley.</p> <p>I love eating these greens as a side to some protein, or even a main meal with a fried egg. It also keeps very well refrigerated to snack on later, or to put on toast that you\u2019ve rubbed with the garlic confit I mentioned earlier.</p> <p><strong>Quick cooking</strong></p> <p>These techniques are for softer greens that are just too horrid to eat raw \u2013 water spinach, in fact all spinach, Asian brassicas like Chinese broccoli, choy sum, and even lettuces. By cooking them you will actually unlock more of their nutrients, especially if you add a citric element to it at the end. Either a quick stir fry with some rendered pork fat or a healthy oil like olive or macadamia and chopped garlic and a simple seasoning, or blanching and steaming, work well.</p> <p>For stir frying, let your wok or pan heat up first, add your fat and wait a minute, or use this time to chop up your garlic. If steaming or blanching, leave the water on high until it is full-on boiling then add the vegetables to cook \u2013 very minimally.</p> <p>Even once you\u2019ve turned off the heat, the vegetables will still be cooking, so bear that in mind. I tend to turn the heat off just before I think the vegetables are at point I like to eat them, because the transition time from cooking to plating will make those veggies exactly right.</p> <p><strong>Greens to keep raw</strong></p> <p>Lettuces, salad mixes, radicchio, endive, softer hearts of certain chicories, celery hearts and leaves, sorrel, edible weeds like pennywort, purslane and cranberry hibiscus are all best left cold. Don\u2019t forget that even in the raw state, when you add oils, acid and salt, you are essentially cooking it minimally. I could eat salads till the cows come home, and there are a million ways to make it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/mar/29/easy-cheesy-a-comforting-bake-that-works-with-whatever-you-have\">Easy cheesy: a comforting bake that works with whatever you have</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All you need for inspiration is to taste what is in season and remember the tenets of flavour profiles \u2013 salty, sour, sweet, bitter and fat \u2013 when you are composing a salad. Add a little of each, tasting as you go. Don\u2019t forget that you can always add larder staples like nuts, fresh or dried fruits, cooked grains or cheeses. Layer your sour notes by using different vinegars, citrus juice and zest.</p> <p>Don\u2019t forget there are many ways to salt your food that don\u2019t even include salt, like fish sauce, anchovies, shrimp paste, Vegemite, seaweed and other sea vegetables, miso, soy sauce or even nutritional yeast. Pull out your frozen roasted vegetables and add those too. </p> <h2>And the rest of it \u2026</h2> <p>Use up odds and ends such as off-cuts and peels of carrots, daikon, parsnip, onions, garlic peel, celery and mushrooms in bone stocks (my tip is to roast the bones first for a deeper flavour). These can be portioned out and kept frozen (250mls is my preferred size). If I don\u2019t have quite enough to make a large pot, I save everything up in the freezer first until I do. Making stock can feel like a commitment \u2013 it is \u2013 but once you\u2019ve finished washing that big pot and your freezer is well stocked up with the future potential of soups, curries, ragu and the like, you will feel an immense satiety.</p> <p>Water kefir is another great way to use up bits and bobs from fruit. Feeding the grains and drinking the byproduct is a source of continual entertainment and probiotics. Water kefir grains can be bought online; I like <a href=\"https://www.thefermentary.com.au/\">the Fermentary</a>. Figuring out what to feed my water kefir grains, and the trial and error of flavour combinations, is a source of real joy for me at the moment \u2013 lemongrass is a winner, for instance.</p> <p>Cooking from a mystery box is an adventure \u2013 the best thing to do is to take a deep breath and dive right in.</p>",

However, the recent reports of growing alcohol sales and our own research showing that one million of us in Scotland are drinking more under lockdown, highlight the ongoing issue we still have with alcohol in this country. It remains to be seen what impact social distancing will have and what new challenges it will throw up. But it is unlikely that Scotland\u2019s unhealthy relationship with alcohol will be changed for the better.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Discussions are currently taking place in the Scottish government about a possible relaxation of alcohol licensing restrictions during the lockdown, as elderly shoppers and others take advantage of early supermarket opening.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div

England show that 56,161 mortgages were approved for house purchase in March. </p> \n  <p>This was a drop-off of nearly a quarter (24%) compared with the previous month, and the lowest monthly total

chemotherapy treatments were running at 70% of normal levels but two-week referrals were down by 62%. <br><br>She told MPs at the health and social care committee: \u201cBroadly, chemotherapy appointments are running at about 70% of normal levels and the reason for that, and we think we can set them back very quickly because, of course, is they use different facilities and workforce broadly from surgery and the other resources required to respond to Covid-19.\u201d <br><br>She added: \u201cWe had just under 15,000 people booked for an appointment but that is a 62% reduction and clearly it\u2019s very important we address that because early detection is vital for increased survival.\u201d <br><br>When asked if that meant up to two-thirds of cancers were being missed, Dame Cally replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case because the service has roughly an 8% conversion rate for urgent referrals. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really important to state that urgent referrals and urgent cancer treatments are continuing \u2013 obviously we need to tailor that to patients\u2019 individual risk but I think it would be wrong to make a mathematical calculation on that basis. <br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s very important that we get people coming forward but I think to translate that into missed diagnosis and poor survival would not be a responsible position at

more anxious during the pandemic. <br><br>She said: \u201cA lot of women get anxious during pregnancy anyway and I think the pathways for advice and referrals have got better over recent years. <br><br>\u201cDuring the pandemic, women have become even more anxious because pregnant women are a vulnerable group, so there has been an increase in referrals to perinatal mental health services, we know that. <br><br>\u201cWhat we are trying to do is bring some of that support and care back to the midwife. <br><br>\u201cEvery woman has a midwife, midwives have training in supporting women who have anxiety and apprehension, and the ability to refer onwards if they believe a wider mental health team would be of assistance.\u201d <br><br>Walton emphasised the importance of directing pregnant women to call their midwives with mental health concerns in the first instance.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-01T10:05:27.945Z\">at 11.05am

she is concerned high-risk pregnancies may be missed due to the pandemic, leading to a potential rise in stillbirths and neonatal deaths. <br><br>Addressing the health and social care committee, Gill Walton said: \u201cSome of that is related to the fear of the pregnant population and presenting to maternity services during the pandemic, and that fear then prevents them even sometimes just picking up the phone to say they may be concerned. <br><br>\u201cI believe that maternity services have tried their very best to try and keep providing as much of a normal service as possible. <br><br>\u201cI do think it\u2019s really important to be getting that message out that maternity services are still open and that women should come forward so that we can keep them and their babies as well as possible.\u201d <br><br>Walton said that follow-ups on women who miss scans and appointments has been enhanced. <br><br>She added: \u201cOne of the positives from the pandemic is the use of technology, so there has been more virtual contact and follow-up with women through midwives and maternity services than before.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated

  "<p>Dave Kitson\u2019s bid to become chief executive of the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association has received a blow after the chairman of Kick It Out questioned his anti-racism credentials and three black players attacked the former Reading striker\u2019s controversial comments about Raheem Sterling.</p> <p>Kitson launched his campaign to replace Gordon Taylor as the head of the PFA this week but he faces an uphill battle to win the support of black players, who have not forgotten how he reacted to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/30/chelsea-ban-fan-life-racial-abuse-raheem-sterling\" title=\"\">Chelsea supporter racially abusing Sterling</a> in December 2018 by saying that the Manchester City forward\u2019s social media posts had \u201cantagonised\u201d people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/06/pfa-chief-executive-gordon-taylor-says-he-will-not-take-wage-cut\">PFA's Gordon Taylor not cutting salary but donates \u00a3500,000 to NHS and charity</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The 40-year-old was accused of excusing racism after suggesting Sterling had made himself a target during an appearance on TalkSport and his bid to replace Taylor has been met with an angry response from current and former professionals. Jobi McAnuff said Kitson\u2019s remarks about Sterling had crossed a line and the Leyton Orient captain\u2019s views were backed up by Marvin Sordell, the former Bolton striker, and Marcus Bean, the former Brentford and Wycombe midfielder.</p> <p>Sanjay Bhandari, the head of Kick It Out, football\u2019s anti-discrimination charity, said: \u201cThe PFA are valued partners of Kick It Out. Anyone who has aspirations to lead the PFA in the future must have in mind the best interests of all players. Given Dave Kitson\u2019s previous remarks, I would be deeply concerned about his ability to represent black players. He needs to win their confidence and I doubt he can do that.\u201d</p> <p>At the time Kitson said Sterling\u2019s posts were \u201cno excuse whatsoever for racially abusing somebody, but you sow a seed amongst people who are not racist, not to like that particular person, because they don\u2019t want to see that in their faces every day\u201d. When contacted by the Guardian about the reaction to his PFA bid he said: \u201cMy objective is to ensure that the policies of the union reflect the needs and aspirations of all its members. Very importantly, that must include a much more effective anti-racism policy.\u201d</p> <p>McAnuff, who spent a season in the Premier League with Reading, said: \u201cHe\u2019s had his say on certain matters, particularly on Raheem Sterling, and that certainly was something that I objected to in the most severe manner. He\u2019s almost saying he brought on any racist abuse himself. That is inexcusable. Even if Raheem Sterling had been posting pictures of his lifestyle, that gives nobody a right to racially abuse somebody.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact he could suggest that was a reason is completely unacceptable. I\u2019ve gone on Dave Kitson\u2019s Instagram and seen some of the pictures he\u2019s put on, which would be similar to what he was saying about Raheem showing off. He has pictures with a gun, he has pictures with flash cars after his retirement. It was massively hypocritical.\u201d</p> <p>McAnuff insisted an apology would not suffice for him. \u201cA line has been crossed,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t see that many other players in my position would accept an apology and be happy to move on.\u201d</p> <p>Sordell, who retired last year, was asked whether he thought Kitson is unfit to lead the union. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cThe PFA represents players. They are where players go for protection. Whether that\u2019s happened or not in the past or currently is a different debate. If we look forward to the future and to somebody who makes excuses for racism and doesn\u2019t protect the player, how can we look to those people for protection in the future.</p> <p>\u201cWhat he said is so wrong and it\u2019s that mentality that stops us progressing. What he said isn\u2019t necessarily racist but it allows room for racism to grow. It allows people to think saying certain things is OK. It isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Bean, who also retired last year, said: \u201cIt\u2019s audacity. Having someone like that in charge would leave a sour taste in my mouth. I would vehemently protest it before he was in charge. He wouldn\u2019t receive my vote and I\u2019d be actively trying to rectify the situation if he was in charge. People aren\u2019t happy. Not just players but also black agents I speak to and other staff in the game. People are asking how this can be representative of us.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Labour\u2019s ruling national executive committee (NEC) has appointed a four-person panel to investigate the leaked internal report describing a \u201chyper-factional\u201d environment among party staff hostile to Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <p>The unredacted report, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/19/labour-party-financial-peril-keir-starmer-members-leaked-report\">leaked last month</a>, reignited the row in the party over Labour\u2019s handling of antisemitism cases, and led to calls for party members named in it to be suspended.</p> <p>A party spokesperson said on Friday that Martin Forde QC would chair the investigation, which will cover both the contents of the report, and the circumstances of its release.</p> <p>A spokesperson said Forde would be supported by three experts in \u201cthe law and the Labour party\u2019s structures\u201d, and would examine \u201cthe circumstances, contents and release of an internal report\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe NEC has agreed that the investigation should endeavour to deliver its report by the middle of July,\u201d the spokesperson said.</p> <p>The report included hundreds of private WhatsApp messages from named staff members, many of them expressing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/12/hostility-to-corbyn-curbed-labour-efforts-to-tackle-antisemitism-says-leaked-report\">hostility </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/12/hostility-to-corbyn-curbed-labour-efforts-to-tackle-antisemitism-says-leaked-report\">towards Corbyn</a> or his close allies and bemoaning Labour\u2019s better-than-expected performance at the 2017 general election.</p> <p>The officials discussed funnelling election campaign funds to favoured candidates, including the former deputy leader Tom Watson.</p> <p>The dossier also named complainants in antisemitism cases. It was prepared as a background document, intended to be submitted alongside Labour\u2019s response to the Equality and Human Rights Commission\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/05/seventy-labour-staffers-give-statements-to-antisemitism-inquiry\">investigation into the party</a>.</p> <p>When Labour\u2019s lawyers decided the document should not be submitted, it was leaked. Starmer said at the time he was \u201cshocked\u201d by its contents, and by the fact that it had been published. His handling of the sensitive issue is regarded by both sides of the party as an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/23/swift-inquiry-agreed-into-leak-of-labour-report-on-handling-anti-semitism\">early test of his leadership</a>.</p> <p>In addition to Forde, the panellists will be three Labour peers: Debbie Wilcox, a former leader of Newport city council; Larry Whitty, a former Labour party general secretary, and Ruth Lister, an emeritus professor of social policy at Loughborough University.</p> <p>Some leftwing NEC members objected to the makeup of the panel. They argued for the veteran campaigner Lord Dubs, who is Jewish, to be included \u2013 but were defeated 18-16 in a vote.</p> <p>A Labour source said:, \u201cKeir and Angela [Rayner] hold Alf Dubs in the highest regard, as we all do, but it is crucial that the panel is not just independent but perceived as independent. Keir did not think it would be appropriate for someone who was a high profile supporter in his leadership campaign to be involved.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Momentum said: \u201cIt is critical that the inquiry focus on the very serious allegations of racism, sexism, senior staff members trying to sabotage Labour\u2019s 2017 general election campaign and a failure to pursue antisemitism cases.</p> <p>\u201cIn any other organisation, members accused of racism, sexism and misuse of funds would be suspended pending investigation. Labour should be no different, and we call on Labour to suspend those named in the report while the investigation is ongoing.\u201d</p>",

The journalist in question has now resigned from the company.</p> <p>\u201cThe FT wishes to apologise to the Independent and the Evening Standard, which subsequently informed the FT that the same reporter had accessed a meeting it had held.\u201d</p> <p>Di Stefano\u2019s actions raised questions about whether or not he had broken the law, given the meetings were not password protected.</p> <p>Christopher Hutchings, a lawyer at Hamlins who has dealt with a number of phone hacking cases, says \u201cZoombombing\u201d could be in breach of the Computer Misuse Act and data protection and privacy laws.</p> <p>Di Stefano\u2019s actions were in breach of the FT\u2019s code of conduct, which states: \u201cThe press must not seek to obtain or publish material acquired by \u2026 intercepting private or mobile telephone calls, messages or emails. Engaging in misrepresentation or subterfuge \u2026 can generally be justified only in the public interest and then only when the material cannot be obtained by other means.\u201d</p> <p>Hutchings said there was no a public interest defence to invoke in the case. \u201cI would be extremely doubtful that the journalist\u2019s conduct and actions would enable him to rely on this argument,\u201d he said.</p>",

Classes will be split in two and the groups will alternate between lessons at school and at home.</p> <p>Hygiene measures being adopted across Europe include strict handwashing and disinfection regimes, physical distancing and the demarcation of playgrounds into zones to ensure pupils do not mix more than necessary. Children will have to file out of classrooms at different times to maintain physical distancing.</p> <p>Germany has temporarily removed sport and music lessons from the curriculum because they are considered too great a risk, but older pupils already returned to sit exams last month. Nurseries will remain closed for all children, except those of key workers, for the time being.</p> <p>French lower secondary schools may only return in areas where the virus is not widely circulating. All ball games and contact sports will be banned and objects touched by more than one pupil must be disinfected. Classes will be staggered and made up of a maximum of 15 pupils, and breaks will held in shifts to avoid overcrowding in corridors and playgrounds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/lexit-zip/giv-39021fbpvhmJgPJF\" data-alt=\"Lockdown-easing map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/lexit-zip/giv-39021fbpvhmJgPJF\">Lockdown-easing map</a> </figure>  <p>Many teachers say the draft health protocol detailing the regulations is unworkable, especially for classes of younger children.</p> <p>C\u00e9line Prier-Cheron, a trade union representative and teacher at a primary school in the Eure-et-Loir, told French TV: \u201cHow do you explain to children in nursery schools that they have to raise their hand to take an object, get up, go talk to a friend while respecting the barrier and distancing rules?</p> <p>\u201cThis health protocol cannot be applied as it is, especially in nursery schools. Teaching is based on the handling of objects, especially in nursery. If we have to disinfect objects each time a child has handled them, it\u2019ll be impossible.\u201d</p> <p>The parents\u2019 federation, the FCPE, tweeted that parents were reluctant to send children back to school. \u201cThat is what our members are telling us, but they are obviously also under constraints from their employers,\u201d it wrote. \u201cBut there are still too many uncertainties.\u201d</p> <p>The president of Germany\u2019s main teachers\u2019 union, Heinz-Peter Meidinger, said he supported the plan to teach children in alternating shifts, but that regulating hygiene measures was a \u201cmammoth task\u201d. </p> <p>Despite the phased reopenings, scientists in Germany have said children with the coronavirus may be as infectious as adults, and urged caution.</p> <p>Researchers who analysed data on infected people found that the viral loads in children differed little from those in adults. Opening schools on the assumption that children are less likely to spread the virus was therefore ill-advised, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/virologist-christian-drosten-germany-coronavirus-expert-interview\">Christian Drosten</a>, a virologist and Germany\u2019s leading coronavirus expert, who led the team.</p> <p><a href=\"https://zoonosen.charite.de/fileadmin/user_upload/microsites/m_cc05/virologie-ccm/dateien_upload/Weitere_Dateien/analysis-of-SARS-CoV-2-viral-load-by-patient-age.pdf\">Drosten\u2019s study,</a> which was released this week, examined the viral loads in the throats of 3,721 people, including more than 100 children, who tested positive for coronavirus in Berlin between January and April.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>He said he had been able to carry out his analysis once the number of tests carried out by Labor Berlin, the largest laboratory of its kind in Europe, had reached the critical mass of 60,000 earlier this week. That gave him and his team enough data to be able to carry out an analysis of children who have had the virus.</p> <p>Data on children has been scant because of the lack of tests that have been carried out on them, often because they show few if any symptoms.</p> <p>\u201cThe end result is as clear as glass,\u201d Drosten <a href=\"https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/info/podcast4684.html\">said on his podcast</a> with the broadcaster NDR. \u201cChildren do not have significantly different concentrations of the virus in their respiratory passages compared to adults.\u201d</p> <p>Drosten said children were as likely to spread the virus as adults, particularly given their social behaviour, including an inability to practice physical distancing, their increased mobility and a tendency to sing and cry \u2013 activities proven to give the virus droplets as much force as a cough or a sneeze.</p> <p> Lothar Wieler, the head of Germany\u2019s leading disease control body, the Robert Koch Institute, said on Thursday that children play just as important a role in spreading the disease as adults. \u201cThey can be infected, they can excrete the virus and they can infect others,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p>My great friend Peter Walsh, who has died suddenly aged 66 from undetected heart disease, was a criminal defence barrister committed to protecting civil and legal rights and a dedicated football mentor who founded, funded and coached youth teams.</p> <p>Peter was born in Clydebank, Glasgow, one of three children of Tommy Walsh, a docker, and his wife, Sadie (nee Dolan). Home life in Glasgow was unhappy and when Peter was eight, his mother took the children away to Hull, where she qualified as a teacher. There Peter grew up in a socialist community and his mother succeeded in becoming a primary headteacher. His stepfather, Walt Cunningham, was a dockers\u2019 shop steward and later city councillor.</p> <p>After attending the local Buckingham Street primary school, in 1964 Peter went to the new David Lister high school, Hull\u2019s first comprehensive. There, he thrived, representing the school at football, cricket, rugby, badminton, volleyball, hockey and cross-country running.</p> <p>But his time at David Lister came to a premature end when he was expelled aged 17 for persistent lateness and alleged insolence. He felt unjustly treated and it was a formative experience. With the help of a maths teacher, Harry Gurevitch, with whom Peter formed a lasting bond, he took his A-levels at another Hull comprehensive, the Leo Schultz high school.</p> <p>Peter then went to City of London Polytechnic (now London Metropolitan University) and took a degree in politics and government, maintaining his sporting activities. He captained the football team to national success, winning the British Polytechnics Cup in 1976, and the following year became president of the student union. He then studied law \u2013 also at City Polytechnic \u2013 and was called to the bar in 1982 at Gray\u2019s Inn. After his pupillage in Middlesbrough, he practised in Newcastle, at 46 Grainger Street and finally Trinity Chambers, where his commitment to justice blossomed and he became well known for supporting junior staff.</p> <p>He was a successful criminal defence barrister, driven by the principle that a person charged with a crime is entitled to representation by an independent advocate whose skills as a lawyer should be of the highest order.</p> <p>Peter started youth football teams wherever he lived and funded them himself: Clara Vale Celtic, Wylam Celtic and in 2003 he revived football in Corbridge, where he lived, welcoming players of all abilities and giving life to the now thriving Tynedale Football club. He played cricket for Stocksfield and Corbridge, was a qualified football coach and referee and was still playing football and cricket right up to his death.</p> <p>Peter remained a staunch Celtic fan. He also had a lifelong love of Hull Kingston Rovers, passed on by his stepdad, and visited from Corbridge as often as possible to watch them. </p> <p>Peter loved being outdoors, walking Murphy, his beloved dog, growing his own vegetables on his allotment and cooking for his family. He walked Hadrian\u2019s wall and climbed the \u201cthree peaks\u201d, and had been planning to do the coast-to-coast walk this year.</p> <p>Peter is survived by his wife, Debbie (nee Lynch), whom he married in 1986, their children, Adam, Rose Erin, Caitlin and Patrick, and his siblings, Rosemary and Thomas. </p>",
  "<p>Kamrul Islam doesn\u2019t dare visit his local supermarket. Over the last few weeks, he said three of his closest friends fell ill with the coronavirus shortly after shopping there. One friend\u2019s mother became seriously unwell after contracting the virus and died.</p> <p>The 40-year-old former cab driver says a day doesn\u2019t go by when he isn\u2019t aware of a death or infection of someone he knows. While the coronavirus has spread widely across the UK, the pandemic has taken a huge toll on the area where Islam lives, the east London borough of Newham, which has recorded the worst mortality rate in England and Wales.</p> <p>The borough\u2019s rate \u2013 144.3 deaths per 100,000 people \u2013 is closely followed by Brent in north London (141.5), and Newham\u2019s neighbour Hackney (127.4), according to figures published by the Office for National Statistics.

They are young and old. It\u2019s been really tough,\u201d Islam said. His wife, who wished to remain anonymous, said: \u201cYou hear sad stories of people dying and no one was with them.

Though parts of the borough have undergone regeneration and housing prices have rocketed, the legacy of the games wasn\u2019t felt by all.</p> <p>Rokhsana Fiaz, who was elected mayor of Newham nearly two years ago, said: \u201cI\u2019ve grown up in the borough and lived here all my life. Like many of my friends, the opportunities that were promised with regards to the Olympics weren\u2019t necessarily felt by me or my peer group. There\u2019s a real sense of haves and have nots in the community. My promise has been we\u2019re going to reverse that because everyone in Newham needs to have a stake.\u201d</p> <p>The borough\u2019s deprivation and diversity makes it particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus. More than half of children live in poverty, while the rate of households in temporary accommodation is one of the highest in England. A study commissioned by the council found that up to 36,000 people are not paid the legally required national minimum wage.</p> <p>Newham has the most diverse population profile of any local authority in the country. Some 78% of residents are from ethnic minority communities, which has been reported as a risk factor for the coronavirus. Many live in intergenerational households and there are longstanding health inequalities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c66e5ac340b5f16c0d6b3fff3712732f96a3f9e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c66e5ac340b5f16c0d6b3fff3712732f96a3f9e4/400_573_4600_2760/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tahir Mirza, chair of East Ham Labour party.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tahir Mirza, chair of East Ham Labour party.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca Dragoi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tahir Mirza, Newham resident and chair of the local Labour party in East Ham, described the deaths in his area as \u201ctruly shocking\u201d and called for more efforts for people in the community to get guidelines on social distancing in their own language. He said many didn\u2019t speak English and were simply unaware of the dangers they faced. The consequences of failing to reach these people will be dire, he said: \u201cPeople will continue to die otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Zubaida Haque, deputy director of the Runnymede Trust, said areas like Newham show the discussion about PPE and testing needs to go much further than just the NHS. Key workers, from taxi drivers and care workers to grocery shop owners, who are disproportionately from a BAME background, also require protective equipment. \u201cBAME key workers aren\u2019t just NHS staff. We need to start asking whether they are getting proper PPE equipment. Are they being protected? Are they being tested? Is that infrastructure there?\u201d</p> <p>Peter Raison, a 58-year-old train driver for Transport for London who lives across the road from Islam, is also not surprised by the high level of mortality. Many like him on their street have to go to work and even he isn\u2019t being provided with PPE. He is upset that there are people still failing to socially distance as the death tolls increase. \u201cPeople are just assuming it\u2019s not going to happen to me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",
  "<p>My friend Peter Jackson, who has died aged 91, was a Labour MP in the time of Harold Wilson, contributing to a raft of progressive social reforms despite a short period in the Commons. Outside politics, he had a varied career that included university teaching in sociology, adult education and industrial studies.</p> <p>Born in Sheffield, Peter was the son of Len Jackson, an undertaker who became a rating officer for the Sheffield local authority, and his wife, Mary (nee Manyer), who ran a car hire company.</p> <p>He attended Nether Edge grammar school, where he took an interest in the Common Wealth party and read what was then the Manchester Guardian. Leaving school at the age of 16, Peter trained as an accountant in a Sheffield firm.</p> <p>He was conscripted into the RAF when he turned 18, and was posted to a Norfolk airbase, where a current affairs tutor suggested he should go to university. He went to Durham in 1949 to study sociology, with the aim of becoming a social worker. Instead, he left to take a teaching diploma at University College Leicester (now Leicester University), then registered for a PhD on John Stuart Mill while a research assistant at Liverpool University. He completed it in 1973 at Hull University.</p> <p>In Leicester he joined the Labour party, and became its candidate for High Peak in Derbyshire at the 1966 general election. He won the seat \u2013 its first Labour MP. He was the sole party member to vote against the Prices and Incomes Act 1966, which sought to stifle wage rises to control inflation, to the displeasure of Wilson, the prime minister. He was involved as a whip in the private members\u2019 bills leading to the Abortion Act 1967 and the Divorce Reform Act 1969, as well as the Sexual Offences Act 1967 on homosexuality. He lost his seat in 1970 and went back to Hull for two years, before another two as a tutor at the Open University. I was the Labour party agent for High Peak at both general elections of 1974, including February, when Peter unsuccessfully attempted to regain the seat.</p> <p>He became a planning officer for South Yorkshire metropolitan council in 1974 but had a serious car accident in 1977. After recovery, he stood unsuccessfully as the 1979 Labour MEP candidate for Birmingham North.</p> <p>Peter taught at Roma University in Lesotho from 1980 to 1984 before returning to adult teaching for the university at Hull and at Matlock for Nottingham University.</p> <p>He was also director of the Access Committee charity in London, which was concerned with access for disabled people; and did work for a Welsh company manufacturing materials for the construction of houses for disabled people. He retired in 1992 but served on an industrial tribunal until the age of 70.</p> <p>Peter left the Labour party with Tony Blair\u2019s leadership, but rejoined in 2015 when Jeremy Corbyn was elected.</p> <p>In retirement Peter and his second wife, Liz (nee Henderson), travelled often to Australia to visit family.

  "<p>The Foreign Office has obstructed a search for truth into the death of 19-year-old motorcyclist Harry Dunn, lawyers for his family have claimed prior to a potentially tense meeting with aides to Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary.</p> <p>Dunn died in August when his motorcycle collided with a car driven by Anne Sacoolas, the wife of a US intelligence officer stationed at a US spy base at RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire. Sacoolas immediately admitted to the police she had caused the accident by driving on the wrong side of the road.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/22/harry-dunn-death-timeline-key-events-anne-sacoolas\">Harry Dunn death: a timeline of key events</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She then left the country a fortnight later claiming diplomatic immunity. The US government has rejected a Home Office request for her to return to the UK to stand trial. The family had also written to Donald Trump urging him to reconsider his refusal to send her back to the UK, but the US government on Thursday again rejected the plea.</p> <p>Downing Street insists it backed the Dunn campaign to persuade Sacoolas to return to face UK courts and had objected to her departure every step of the way.</p> <p>But the family\u2019s lawyers, after leaks of internal memos and evidence given to the foreign affairs select committee, believe they were misled.</p> <p>The UK shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, has called for a parliamentary inquiry into how the family were treated. It is understood that Keir Starmer, the Labour leader and former director of public prosecutions, is also taking an interest.</p> <p>The family is seeking a judicial review into the handling of the case, which could reveal if there were any conflicting currents within the Foreign Office over whether to resist the US view that she was covered by diplomatic immunity. Any court hearing might also reveal exchanges between the Northamptonshire police and the Foreign Office over the degree of discretion the police had to arrest and prosecute Sacoolas, even if the Foreign Office (FCO) told the police she had diplomatic immunity.</p> <p>Radd Seiger, the lawyer for the Dunn family, said he would be demanding the truth at Friday\u2019s meeting: \u201cThe foreign secretary has stated in each of our meetings with him that the FCO fought to keep Mrs Sacoolas here.</p> <p>\u201cThe FCO\u2019s initial position, like ours, was that Mrs Sacoolas did not have diplomatic immunity. So why did they cave in on this interpretation of the law in a matter of three working days? To make matters worse, they failed to pass any of this to Northants police, who were kept totally in the dark for 14 days when it was their job to establish whether she had immunity or not. Shockingly, the police were not told anything until the day after Mrs Sacoolas left, depriving them of their ability to investigate matters.\u201d</p> <p>Sacoolas left the UK on 15 September after the Foreign Office agreed she had diplomatic immunity, and the US refused to waive it. Internal memos suggest the Foreign Office decided she had immunity, a complex point of law, within a week of Dunn\u2019s death.</p> <p>Seiger\u2019s argument turns on exchanges between the Foreign Office and the US State Department in the immediate wake of the crash that led to Foreign Office lawyers concluding she did have diplomatic immunity, he says.</p> <p>The Foreign Office negotiated a treaty with the US and the UK that waived immunity for US staff at the Croughton base, but the treaty was silent on the status of the staff\u2019s dependants, such as Sacoolas, leading the US to argue she had immunity.</p> <p>A Foreign Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe have deep sympathy for Harry\u2019s family. We have done and will continue to do everything we properly can to ensure that justice is done.</p> <p><em>\u201c</em>As the foreign secretary set out in parliament, Anne Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity whilst in the country under the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations.</p> <p><em>\u201c</em>We consistently called for Anne Sacoolas\u2019s immunity to be waived before she left the UK.

  "<p>Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was accused of artificially inflating the number of coronavirus tests, as he hailed the rapid expansion that allowed him to reach a self-imposed 100,000-a-day target as a \u201cnational achievement\u201d.</p> \n<p>It emerged that a third of the 122,347 tests included in the final 24-hour period before the deadline were counted before they had been carried out.</p> \n<p>Around 39,000 had been sent out to households and satellite testing locations, with no guarantee of the timescale for their completion, but were still included in the count.</p> \n<p>The figure marked a significant rise on Thursday\u2019s total of 81,611 tests, and comfortably exceeded the 100,000 daily target. The latest figure of 122,000 tests were carried out on 73,000 people, with the remainder being retests.</p> \n<p>Hancock praised colleagues and private sector partners for the rapid increase in testing capability, which has seen mobile testing units and new labs created \u2013 and defended the target itself.</p> \n<p>\u201cSetting stretching, ambitious goals in a national crisis has a galvanising effect on everyone involved,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew that it was an audacious goal but we needed an audacious goal,\u201d he said. \u201cI can announce that we have met our goal.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, Hancock was criticised by his Labour shadow, Jon Ashworth. \u201cMany would have expected the 100,000 promise to have been met by actually carrying out testing, not simply because 39,000 kits had been mailed out,\u201d Ashworth said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis headline figure shouldn\u2019t count tests that hadn\u2019t been used or indeed might never be used.

It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>\n    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>\n    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>\n    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.</p>\n    <p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a>&nbsp;says it should be the \u201cbackbone of the response\u201d in every country.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\"><b>Sarah Boseley</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Hancock announced that 27,510 people have now died from Covid-19: an increase of 739. The figures have risen significantly since the government began including deaths taking place in care homes, as well as those in hospitals.</p> \n<p>The health secretary reiterated the government\u2019s determination to recruit 18,000 people to help track the progress of the disease by mid-May, as part of what he called a \u201cfull-scale test, track and trace model\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf it needs to be bigger, we\u2019ll scale it up as required,\u201d he added. He also said the government will shortly release the app it has been trialling, which is aimed at identifying sufferers and warning those they have met.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople will be able to know if they\u2019ve been in close contact with someone who\u2019s transmitting the disease, and take action if they need to,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The government has come under mounting pressure to explain why it didn\u2019t build up the capacity to track the infection earlier \u2013 instead, halting the tracing of individual cases in March.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The Conservative MP Greg Clark, who chairs the science and technology committee, wrote a testy public letter to Public Health England on Friday to urge it to publish more evidence about why that decision was made, after it declined to do so.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is important that the bodies responsible for UK policy and practice are transparent about the basis of vital decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is disappointing that Public Health England has still not disclosed the assessment they made which led them to reject the South Korean approach to testing.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo I ask again for PHE to publish the evidence which informed UK testing strategy, without further delay.\u201d</p> \n<p>The plea followed a hearing with PHE officials last month.</p>",

But it also condemned Lyon to missing out on European competition for the first time in 24 years, and the club\u2019s overlord, Jean-Michel Aulas, says that\u2019s a bowl of sick he won\u2019t swallow. \u201cThis is robbing us of an opportunity that is very significant, of high value,\u201d he howled before vowing to deploy a crack squad of lawyers in an eat-this-mofos formation. \u201cWe are going to claim damages worth several dozen million euros,\u201d stormed Aulas, scratching his nails down a chalkboard. \u201cNo\u00ebl Le Gra\u00ebt has to face the consequences as president of the FFF. His management here was poor. There were poorly thought-out decisions.\u201d</p> \n<p>Aulas had proposed alternative ways of determining the final standings, including play-offs whenever, and pointed out that Lyon have a habit of finishing seasons strongly. A similar claim was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/01/amiens-vow-to-fight-ligue-1-relegation-after-injustice-of-season-resolution\">made by the president of Amiens</a>, who have been consigned to relegation. \u201cSince our non-league days our success has always been built on our finishes to the season,\u201d declared Bernard Joannin, the head of a club who had hope of survival despite being on a 13-match winless run. \u201cI will go to the end to uphold our rights because I am a warrior. There were still 30 points up for grabs and we were just four below N\u00eemes!

  "<p>As of 30 April, Vietnam has a <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/viet-nam/\">coronavirus death count of zero</a> and only 270 cases. While the mortality numbers climb into the hundreds of thousands across the world, Vietnam has <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/vietnam-has-reported-no-coronavirus-deaths-how-136646\">managed to contain the outbreak</a> of coronavirus through timeliness, aggressive infection control, mass mobilisation of its population and an unprecedented level of openness.</p> <p>Out of the key factors that contributed to Vietnam\u2019s successful coronavirus response, timeliness was the first. Vietnam acted early and did not hesitate to alert its citizens. On <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/live/2020/jan/28/coronavirus-first-death-in-beijing-as-us-issues-new-china-travel-warning-live-updates\">28 January</a>, when the country recorded only two cases, the government announced that it was planning for a scenario in which thousands of people could contract the virus.</p> <p>In the following weeks, Vietnam continuously <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_Vietnam\">imposed restrictions</a> and issued policies ahead of and sometimes against the WHO\u2019s recommendations, such as a series of international travel bans and the compulsory wearing of face masks. In late January, the WHO was <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/articles-detail/updated-who-advice-for-international-traffic-in-relation-to-the-outbreak-of-the-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-24-jan\">advising against</a> international traffic restrictions \u2013 and to this day, it still stands by the recommendation that face masks are not necessary for the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51205344\">general public</a>.</p> <p>Due to limited treatment infrastructures, the Vietnamese government has focused on mass testing and aggressive contact tracing \u2013 a tactic it had employed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/apr/21/china.sars\">to fight </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/apr/21/china.sars\">Sars</a> 17 years ago. Only this time on a larger scale. As of 30 April, Vietnam had conducted <a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/covid-19-pandemic/vietnam-poised-export-covid-19-test-kits\">261,004 tests</a> and put tens of thousands of people in isolation.</p> <p>Testing and contact tracing is based on a four-level principle announced by the health ministry: confirmed Covid-19 patients and their direct contacts (level 1: isolation and treatment in hospitals); close contacts with level 1 (level 2: quarantine facilities); close contacts with level 2 (level 3: self-quarantine at home); and lockdown of the neighbourhood/village/town where the patient lives (level 4).</p> <p>Adhering to this principle has meant <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-vietnam-fight-insi/after-aggressive-mass-testing-vietnam-says-it-contains-coronavirus-outbreak-idUSKBN22B34H\">testing a massive number of suspected cases</a> for every new patient. So far, Vietnam has tested nearly <a href=\"https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/xklpykkaqpg/index.html\">800 people</a> for each new confirmed case, the highest ratio in the world, according to Reuters data. Vietnam was able to make its own test kits and has even <a href=\"https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/who-approves-made-in-vietnam-covid-19-test-kit-4090402.html\">exported the kits</a> to Europe and the US.</p> <p>In real life, this scale of testing is easier said than done. Vietnam has gone to great lengths to locate the virus, even utilising methods that could have been controversial in countries with stricter privacy rights. It publishes a detailed travel history of every new patient on social media and in local newspapers in order to seek people who have been in close contact with them. To increase vigilance, the government has also released a mobile app for people to alert the authority about suspected infections in their area. For all people entering the country, a health declaration is now compulsory, with criminal penalties for false declarations.</p> <p>Some would claim these measures are intrusive and would doubt their effectiveness if implemented elsewhere. This may be true. Vietnam is a one-party state with decades of experience in mobilising its population through wars, Sars and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/swine-flu\">swine flu</a> outbreaks.</p> <p>In the early days of the epidemic, the government framed the outbreak as a war. Doctors and nurses were referred to as \u201csoldiers\u201d, and the newly formed National Steering Committee for Covid-19 Prevention and Control was dubbed the \u201cGeneral Headquarters\u201d \u2013 a reference back to a military body in existence until 1975.</p> <p>Not only has the language of war been revived, the military has been central to tackling the outbreak. It has been in charge of coordinating the food, transport and accommodation required to quarantine thousands of people returning home to Vietnam from outbreak zones such as the UK.</p> <p>As in wartime, almost every sector, including aviation, healthcare and food production, has been mobilised and dedicated to containing the pandemic. Citizens, meanwhile, are encouraged via social media, text messages and TV broadcasts to donate to the nation\u2019s disease prevention funds.</p> <p>These messages have not been communicated in a rigid militaristic style. Instead, the government has been creative. It updates citizens via regular text messages and has teamed up with two famous pop singers to produce an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eWmKQmMoFk\">educational song about the virus</a>, commissioned artists to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj7jvskxQAY\">create </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj7jvskxQAY\">posters</a>, and used young, influential figures to broadcast positive messages to those under mandatory quarantine.</p> <p>These creative messages have resonated with many living in lockdown. Vu Dinh Thai, a 25-year-old Vietnamese graduate student in the UK, spent nearly a month in the government\u2019s quarantine camp. Despite unhygienic water and limited access to the internet, he was grateful for the safety he couldn\u2019t be assured of in the UK. \u201cIt\u2019s free and they tried their best,\u201d he told me via text messages, \u201cand who would belittle their country for being poor?\u201d</p> <p>Vietnam made it clear at the beginning of the pandemic that it wanted to protect its reputation as \u201ca safe country\u201d. Yet by being open with its people, the government has achieved more than just safeguarding its image; it has rebuilt public trust. For the past few years, Vietnam has had to deal with protests over non-transparent handling of environmental disasters such as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/aug/14/vietnamese-fishermen-jobless-fish-poisoning-battle-justice\">mass fish poisoning</a> in 2016, land disputes, and most recently a controversial bill of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vietnam-security-trials/vietnam-jails-15-more-over-economic-zone-protests-idUSKBN1KL0DU\">special economic zones</a>.</p> <p>The question is whether Vietnam can retain this level of transparency in the aftermath of the crisis. Respecting and being open with the people can only benefit Vietnam.</p> <p>\u2022 Trang Bui is a Vietnamese freelance journalist based in Ho Chi Minh City</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 May 2020. The test kits being made by Vietnam have yet to be approved by the WHO.</p>",
  "<p>Art conceived in the name of charity does not have the strongest track record; those with a mind for cultural ephemera wince at the memory of such fundraising musical singles as We Are the World and Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas?. Though these projects may have been organized under the objective of providing aid at a time of desperate need, their maudlin self-satisfaction could not stand up to scrutiny under the usual rubrics used to critique any other release. And so this was the specific strain of dread that <a href=\"https://youtu.be/1Vl_oUMyGYU\">Parks and Recreation</a> fans brought to the news of a reunion episode hastily coordinated in order to put together donations for Feeding America, a nonprofit funding a vast network of pantries, soup kitchens and other community-based centers. A show that often lapsed into corniness in its later years seemed primed to return drenched in high-fructose corn syrup with an extra-hefty helping of creamed corn on the side.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/26/amy-poehler-one-must-try-to-be-a-good-citizen-at-this-time\">Amy Poehler: 'One must try to be a good citizen at this time'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Add to that the larger political incongruence of a distinctly Obama-era relic reviving itself in the festering dystopia of Trumpism, and the stage was set for a decently-intended minor debacle. What a relief, then, that this \u201cepisode\u201d (a term here used loosely to refer to a collection of stitched-together self-taped dialogues recorded from the cast\u2019s respective quarantines) should turn out to be nothing more than it has to \u2013 a collection of timely jokes that connect more often than they don\u2019t, reacquainting us in a low-stakes manner with the characters fans have been missing. Things may have changed, faces have developed a few new lines, but the writing staff understands that ultimately it\u2019s just nice to have the gang back together. They let the ensemble bounce off each other without letting external factors get in the way.</p> <p>Most significantly, the reunion episode sheds the political conscience that wedged the regular series into the zeitgeist during the previous presidential administration. A sunny can-do liberalism became Leslie Knope and co\u2019s calling card, an attitude that could not possibly be more out of joint in light of America\u2019s slide into soft fascism and the utter failure of the Democratic party to halt it in any meaningful way. The notion of a cameo from Knope favorite Joe Biden, currently the subject of much discussion regarding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/joe-biden-denies-sexual-assault-allegation-tara-reade-statement\">accusations of sexual </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/joe-biden-denies-sexual-assault-allegation-tara-reade-statement\">assault</a>, was enough to turn any registered voter\u2019s stomach. Mercifully, the show conceived as \u201ca comedy version of The West Wing\u201d now comes to us from a world without Bidens or Clintons or Trumps, its comedy unsullied by commentary at a time when we all just need a laugh.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbEegHkDCV8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jbEegHkDCV8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And so the joke writers do what they do best, and get back to writing jokes. We start with a celebrity pop-in of the welcome variety, with Paul Rudd reprising pampered heir Bobby Newport at his family\u2019s private fox-hunting estate in Switzerland, where he \u201chasn\u2019t caught any yet \u2013 they\u2019re so fast, like zoop! And they\u2019re gone!\u201d After warning of the dangers related to \u201cthe coronus\u201d, he turns it over to our pals from Pawnee, who are of course all taking the proper precautions. Their individual check-ins form the logical extension of those \u201cwhat would X-sitcom\u2019s characters be doing under quarantine?\u201d articles, giving each character a moment fitting what we know about them to our new status quo.</p> <p>Adam Scott\u2019s Ben Wyatt has combined his two great passions by writing a script for a Cones of Dunshire claymation movie, as \u201cpunishingly dense\u201d as the board game inspiring it. He\u2019s isolating separately from wife Leslie, who makes the most pointed comment while mentioning that it was \u201csad, but necessary\u201d that she had to shut down every national park. She\u2019s done her part by starting a bunch of committees and organizing a phone tree, which gives structure to this series of video calls conducted under the in-universe platform of Gryzzl. Once viewers get acclimated to the disjointed comic pacing that results from no two actors sharing the same space, it\u2019s harmless fun.</p> <p>It\u2019s like visiting your hometown to find everything right where you left it, a bit sweet and a bit sad. Nick Offerman\u2019s Ron Swanson still loves meat, and gets one of the biggest laughs by reminding us of the hysterical matrimonial dynamic at play in the Offerman-Mullally household. As wannabe baller Tom Haverford, Aziz Ansari still fixates on seeming with it, name-checking Fortnite and using background filters to place himself in a faux Bali. Dedicated nurse Ann Perkins (Rashida Jones) is on the frontlines, and must quarantine in a \u201cdifferent part of the house\u201d from her husband, Chris Traeger (Rob Lowe), as he donates blood four times each day.</p> <p>Retta\u2019s ever-elegant Donna Meagle situates herself in front of a wall of chromatically arranged sneakers. Aubrey Plaza and Chris Pratt, their careers having risen most precipitously in the years since the finale, get the least to do. We learn that the Luddgate-Dwyer household has a drum set, but most importantly, Pratt leads the stirring sing-along of Bye Bye, Li\u2019l Sebastian that takes us out. It\u2019s an easy way to conclude with something momentous and cathartic, and yet far from the worst-case scenario as to how this could\u2019ve all gone.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwYth4JZP3s\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bwYth4JZP3s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The episode succeeds by allowing itself to be little more than a half-hour of humor. It\u2019s never better than when crafting great setups and punchlines for the tertiary faces making quick appearances. (Boozy newswoman Joan Calamezzo has an EGOT because she has been kicked out of all four major awards ceremonies; cologne magnate Dennis Feinstein markets a scent called Miracle Cure; fan-beloved Jean-Ralphio claims to have been \u201cbanned from Cameo\u201d for recording his videos naked.) </p> <p>By that same tack, the weakest moment comes when the episode adopts an about-face for the lines: \u201cThings will go back to normal. They just have to.\u201d Most Americans have made their peace with the fact that things will most definitely not snap back to normal when this all ends, and that by no means do they \u201chave to.\u201d In a lesser world, the episode would have been ripe with hollow feel-good platitudes like that one, but someone knew better. As Preston Sturges teaches us by the conclusion of Sullivan\u2019s Travels, people living in times of hardship don\u2019t need to be preached to. We just need a break from all the damned stress, and Pawnee\u2019s finest happily obliged.</p>",

If these people were not infected at the market, or via contacts who were infected at the market, critics ask, how do you explain these cases?</p> <h2>The Wuhan labs</h2> <p>Two laboratories in Wuhan studying bat coronaviruses have come under the spotlight. The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) is a biosecurity level 4 facility \u2013 the highest for biocontainment \u2013 and the level 2 Wuhan Centre for Disease Control, which is located not far from the fish market, had collected bat coronavirus specimens.</p> <p>Several theories have been promoted. The first, and wildest, is that scientists at WIV were engaged in experiments with bat coronavirus, involving so-called gene splicing, and the virus then escaped and infected humans. A second version is that sloppy biosecurity among lab staff and in procedures, perhaps in the collection or disposal of animal specimens, released a wild virus.</p> <h2>Is there any evidence the virus was engineered?</h2> <p>The scientific consensus rejecting the virus being engineered is almost unanimous. In a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9\">letter to Nature in March</a>, a team in California led by microbiology professor Kristian Andersen said \u201cthe genetic data irrefutably shows that [Covid-19] is not derived from any previously used virus backbone\u201d \u2013 in other words spliced sections of another known virus.</p> <p>Far more likely, they suggested, was that the virus emerged naturally and became stronger through natural selection. \u201cWe propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of Sars-CoV-2: natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic [animal to human] transfer; and natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.\u201d</p> <p>Peter Ben Embarek, an expert at the World Health Organization in animal to human transmission of diseases, and other specialists also explained to the Guardian that if there had been any manipulation of the virus you would expect to see evidence in both the gene sequences and also distortion in the data of the family tree of mutations \u2013 a so-called \u201creticulation\u201d effect.</p> <p>In a statement to the Guardian, James Le Duc, the head of the Galveston National Laboratory in the US, the biggest active biocontainment facility on a US academic campus, also poured cold water on the suggestion.</p> <p>\u201cThere is convincing evidence that the new virus was not the result of intentional genetic engineering and that it almost certainly originated from nature, given its high similarity to other known bat-associated coronaviruses,\u201d he said.</p> <h2>What about an accidental escape of a wild sample because of poor lab safety practices?</h2> <p>The accidental release of a wild sample has been the focus of most attention, although the \u201cevidence\u201d offered is at best highly circumstantial.</p> <p>The Washington Post has reported concerns in 2018 over security and management weakness from US embassy officials who visited the WIV several times, although the paper also conceded there was no conclusive proof the lab was the source of the outbreak.</p> <p>Le Duc, however, paints a different picture of the WIV. \u201cI have visited and toured the new BSL4 laboratory in Wuhan, prior to it starting operations in 2017- \u2026 It is of comparable quality and safety measures as any currently in operation in the US or Europe.\u201d</p> <p>He also described encounters with Shi Zhengli, the Chinese virologist at the WIV who has led research into bat coronaviruses, and discovered the link between bats and the Sars virus that caused disease worldwide in 2003, describing her as \u201cfully engaged, very open and transparent about her work, and eager to collaborate\u201d.</p> <p>Maureen Miller, an epidemiologist who worked with Shi as part of a US-funded viral research programme, echoed Le Duc\u2019s assessment. She said <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/chinese-lab-conducted-extensive-research-on-deadly-bat-viruses-but-there-is-no-evidence-of-accidental-release/2020/04/30/3e5d12a0-8b0d-11ea-9dfd-990f9dcc71fc_story.html\">she believed the lab escape theory was an \u201cabsolute conspiracy theory\u201d</a> and referred to Shi as \u201cbrilliant\u201d.</p> <h2><br>Problems with the timeline and map of the spread of the virus</h2> <p>While the experts who spoke to the Guardian made clear that understanding of the origins of the virus remained provisional, they added that the current state of knowledge of the initial spread also created problems for the lab escape theory.</p> <p>When Peter Forster, a geneticist at Cambridge, compared sequences of the virus genome collected early in the Chines outbreak \u2013 and later globally \u2013 he identified three dominant strains.</p> <p>Early in the outbreak, two strains appear to have been in circulation at roughly at the same time \u2013 strain A and strain B \u2013 with a C variant later developing from strain B.</p> <p>But in a surprise finding, the version with the closest genetic similarity to bat coronavirus was not the one most prevalent early on in the central Chinese city of Wuhan but instead associated with a scattering of early cases in the southern Guangdong province.</p> <p>Between 24 December 2019 and 17 January 2020, Forster explains, just three out of 23 cases in Wuhan were type A, while the rest were type B. In patients in Guangdong province, however, five out of nine were found to have type A of the virus.</p> <p>\u201cThe very small numbers notwithstanding,\u201d said Forster, \u201cthe early genome frequencies until 17 January do not favour Wuhan as an origin over other parts of China, for example five of nine Guangdong/Shenzhen patients who had A types.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, it still remains far from certain that Wuhan was even necessarily where the virus first emerged.</p> <h2>If there is no evidence of engineering and the origin is still so disputed, why are we still talking about the Wuhan labs theory?</h2> <p>The pandemic has exacerbated existing geopolitical struggles, prompting a disinformation war that has drawn in the US, China, Russia and others.</p> <p>Journalists and scientists have been targeted by people with an apparent interest in pushing circumstantial evidence related to the virus\u2019s origins, perhaps as part of this campaign and to distract from the fact that few governments have had a fault-free response.</p> <h2>What does this mean now?</h2> <p>The current state of knowledge about coronavirus and its origin suggest the most likely explanation remains the most prosaic. Like other coronaviruses before, it simply spread to humans via a natural event, the starting point for many in the scientific community including the World Health Organization.</p> <p>Further testing in China in the months ahead may eventually establish the source of the outbreak. But for now it is too early.</p>",
  "<p>Exactly how terrible are the next months and years going to be? As a generally apocalyptically minded sort of person, I\u2019ve been feeling some pride in watching my favourite question become everyone else\u2019s favourite question, too; it\u2019s like being a 19th-century aristocrat and seeing your debutante daughter become the star of the London season. But in deciding who to listen to, and thus how alarmed to be, it\u2019s easy to overlook a crucial factor: in a crisis as all-consuming as this one, nobody \u2013 not academic experts, not media commentators, not that one friend who keeps urging you to be less (or more) worried than you are \u2013 is a completely neutral observer. Because predictions about the future aren\u2019t solely about the future. They\u2019re also coping mechanisms for dealing with the present.</p> <p>This is obvious enough in the case of the strenuous optimist who insists that in a few weeks everything will be back to normal; she\u2019s clearly attempting to generate a sense of security in a time of uncertainty. But it\u2019s been fascinating to witness the opposite, too: the people in my social circle, and especially my social media feeds, who seem deeply invested in asserting that things will be worse than the rest of us can imagine. (Even professional epidemiologists are <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/pandemic-summer-coronavirus-reopening-back-normal/609940/\" title=\"\">engaged in an arms race</a> to predict a longer and longer timeframe for social distancing.) Psychologically, though, this makes sense. When everything\u2019s up in the air, the person foreseeing absolute disaster has found solid ground: at least things won\u2019t get worse than <em>that</em>.</p> <p>Likewise, consider our political reactions to the pandemic. Fury at the government\u2019s response may be highly justified, but if being angry at the Tories has always been central to your personality, to be angry at the Tories now is also a perverse source of comfort. Virtually nothing may be the same, these days \u2013 but at least the Tories remain hateable.</p> <p>The point here isn\u2019t to dismiss any particular outlook on the grounds that it\u2019s partly a coping mechanism. (Nobody gets by without <em>some</em> coping mechanisms. Mine include writing columns about other people\u2019s.) But it\u2019s useful to see the role they play, if only to stop yourself spiralling into anxiety next time someone you trust paints an especially dark picture of the future. They may be proven right, of course. But what\u2019s certain is they\u2019re a human, engaging in their own private methods for managing their emotions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/10/if-somethings-out-of-your-control-should-you-still-worry-about-it-oliver-burkeman\">If something\u2019s out of your control, should you still worry about it? | Oliver Burkeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Besides, it\u2019s worth remembering that this calamity is further evidence for the truth that most of us, most of the time, have no idea what\u2019s coming. \u201cOn your pessimistic days you should remember, three months ago you would have dismissed the idea of the world being locked down with a pandemic,\u201d the economist Kaushik Basu <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kaushikcbasu/status/1243364872991035393\" title=\"\">observed recently</a>. \u201cExtrapolating from your poor record of forecasting, you should realise your current forecast of future gloom may also be completely wrong.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an argument for replacing pessimism with optimism, but for trying to suspend both.

By harmless I mean that, for the most part, the alienated young men of America pose a greater threat to themselves \u2013 via suicide and addiction \u2013 than to others. Of course, when they do lash out at others, the results are sometimes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/27/alek-minassian-toronto-van-attack-interview-incels\">horrifying acts of violence</a>, often <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/02/us/elliot-rodger-killings-in-california-followed-years-of-withdrawal.html\">against women</a>.</p> <p>One of the film\u2019s producers is Cody Wilson, a self-defined \u201ccrypto-anarchist\u201d. His various <a href=\"https://www.thetrace.org/2019/11/despite-his-criminal-record-cody-wilson-is-back-in-the-3d-printed-gun-business/\">run-ins with the law</a> include <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190812090242/https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/08/cody-wilson-pleads-guilty-to-lesser-charges-will-register-as-a-sex-offender/\">pleading guilty</a> to endangering a child after being brought up on charges of paying a minor for sex and a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2015/05/3-d-printed-gun-lawsuit-starts-war-arms-control-free-speech/\">legal battle</a> with the feds after he released blueprints online for creating a firearm by 3D printer. Wilson is also one of the founders of <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2018/08/01/technology/3d-printed-gun-cody-wilson-defense-distributed/index.html\">Hatreon</a>, a crowdsourcing platform favored by white nationalist groups kicked off Patreon for violating their terms regarding hate speech. So, yeah. Whatever his motivations for producing the film, it\u2019s safe to say they are probably highly questionable. But should that mean we shouldn\u2019t watch it?</p> <p>After the 2016 election, there was a lot of talk about intellectual \u201cbubbles\u201d. Given free rein to choose from the multitude of media sources, voices, and communities to listen to, we tend to go with those we already agree with, getting no outside perspective. But while the leftist bubble was deemed a problem because it left its inhabitants naive about what was happening in \u201cTrump country\u201d, only the more conservative bubble was deemed dangerous. On the right, terrorists and reactionaries were being created, but it\u2019s not like they had anything those on the left needed to know. If anything, the left just needed to infiltrate, so it could \u201cteach\u201d and \u201chelp\u201d those trapped on the right.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is so much misinformation and heightened emotions around this subculture that any real conversation is nearly impossible</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But whatever the politics of these young men \u2013 the documentary\u2019s makers largely omit politics from the conversation, framing the subjects as simply trolls and reflexive antagonists \u2013 they do offer some useful insights. The alienated generally do. Their observations on the way America presents itself as a meritocracy, yet saves its rewards for people with money, family connections, and good looks, are important. The memes and jokes and insults they create might not reach the level of Dostoevsky\u2019s Notes from Underground, but they have some shared sensibility.</p> <p>The alienated young men of America deserve a better intermediary than a previous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/19/cody-wilson-3d-guns-sexual-assault-texas\">international fugitive</a>.

The musician who wrote the score, Ariel Pink, has a long history of edge-lordy political comments \u2013 always carefully packaged in irony and plausible deniability.</p> <p>The greatest failing of the documentary is the way it pretends 4chan and other gathering places for this particular subculture are mostly harmless, perhaps populated with a few bad eggs. (By \u201cbad egg\u201d, I of course mean mass murderers.) One character in the documentary refers to boards where people say they\u2019re going to kill themselves, either as a confession or as a joke, and other users will sometimes encourage the user to follow through. It\u2019s funny, he tells us, except that \u201cmaybe\u201d someone will be sincere and actually die. Except that\u2019s not a maybe \u2013 one user <a href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/news/4chan-stephen-house-fire-livestream/\">actually livestreamed</a> his suicide attempt for 4chan. If you want to talk about a subculture, talking about its dark sides and limitations in a serious way is more helpful than pretending everything is fine.</p> <p>But what if that is part of the film\u2019s agenda? There is so much misinformation and heightened emotions \u2013 the kind that caused authorities across the country to <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/u-s-military-issues-warning-to-troops-about-incel-viol-1838412331\">go into high alert</a> because of a comic-book movie \u2013 around this subculture that any real conversation about incels is nearly impossible.</p> <p>We\u2019re always afraid of alienated figures, because of what they reveal about a society that works for some of us. These young men refuse to go through the motions of pretending the \u201cmeritocratic\u201d American Dream isn\u2019t rigged. That makes those of us with \u201cmerit\u201d nervous.

  "<p>Apart from the multiple kindnesses of friends and new-found neighbours, it\u2019s hard to find a silver lining to the current situation, but one positive is having time to learn stuff you don\u2019t know. In wine terms, that could be a country, a region or a grape variety, particularly one you may have failed to get to grips with in the past, and the immediate one that pops to my mind is riesling.</p> <p>Now, before you say you wine writers are <em>always</em> banging on about riesling, that\u2019s true, but I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to call it the greatest white wine grape in the world (for me, that\u2019s chardonnay). It is, however, massively intriguing in the way it reflects the place where it\u2019s made, its wildly varying levels of sweetness (no, it\u2019s not all sweet) and its ability to age, which may mean that that elderly bottle you stumbled across at the back of the cupboard is, in fact, OK. Riesling also has the advantage of going brilliantly with spicy food and being relatively low in alcohol, which makes it perfect for this time of year.</p> <p>Part of the problem, of course, is that riesling is inextricably associated with Germany, so has to deal with the historic baggage between our two nations, though that\u2019s mercifully dying out, and not before time. It\u2019s also fair to say that the German wines exported here in the 60s and 70s \u2013 not always riesling, but often mistaken for it \u2013 were woefully poor. Add to that a bewildering labelling system (how can <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sp%C3%A4tlese\">sp\u00e4tlese</a> be both a dry <em>and</em> a sweet wine?), as well as tortuously complicated names and labels, and you can see why the stuff fell so out of favour. But German rieslings have changed: these days, they\u2019re drier, higher in alcohol (many Mosel wines are now 11% or 11.5%, rather than 8-9%) and, in many cases, snappily packaged, as you can see from the Shhh\u2026 It\u2019s Riesling in the panel below. And, hooray, sealed with a screw-cap rather than a cork.</p> <p>You also find great riesling in Alsace, Austria and in the new world in Australia, New Zealand and North America\u2019s Washington State. The most rewarding ones, as usual, are to be found in independents such as <a href=\"http://www.thewineryuk.com/home/\">The Winery</a>, or online retailers such as <a href=\"https://www.thewinesociety.com/\">The Wine Society</a>, which has just started delivering again, though at time of writing only by the unsplit case. These supermarket rieslings should at least give you a taste for it, however. Who knows, you might even be able to convert the neighbours\u2026</p> <h2>Five rieslings to try on your own (or drink with friends on Zoom)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"A 12-point spacer with a rule\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 12px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e0823b3c135fd52db1f7fba8a8359eb3b2f4d631\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0823b3c135fd52db1f7fba8a8359eb3b2f4d631/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shhh It\u2019s riesling\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Shhh\u2026 It\u2019s Riesling 2019</strong></p> <p>\u00a36 Co-op, 11.5%.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been warned that there are limited quantities of this crisp, citrussy, dry riesling with its beguiling whiff of green granny smith apple, so grab one if you see it.

His landlord is a friend who is flexible about rent and two supervisors he employs have other work they can fall back on. But even without the pressure of meeting those costs, Bowles says it\u2019s impossible for him to refund all his customers without putting the fledging business at risk. \u201cMost customers have been very accommodating and agreed to reschedule.

In the first few months of the year, owners often use deposits to refurbish accommodation ready for the new season, so most have little money in the bank, and some are in debt. Easter bookings are relied on to inject some cash into the business.</p> <p>Mary and Nate Sparrow, owners of <a href=\"https://www.hippersons.co.uk/\">Hippersons </a><a href=\"https://www.hippersons.co.uk/\">Boatyard</a>, a collection of four houseboats and a glamping pod in Suffolk, invested in a second pod this year to increase capacity for the 2020 season, leaving them with no financial cushion. \u201cPeople think we have loads of money behind us but we don\u2019t. We are now trying to plan ahead financially and considering cashing in our pensions.\u201d</p> <p>This year, Alistair Handyside, owner of <a href=\"https://www.higherwiscombe.com/\">Higher Wiscombe</a> in south-east Devon, a collection of three cottages, invested \u00a3200,000 in the largest one. \u201cOne week later, we went into lockdown and the business stopped dead,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 15 years of running a business, we\u2019ve had three cancellations. On 23 March, we had 16, so this is on a scale that is unprecedented.\u201d</p> <p>Handyside has already lost \u00a380,000 in deferred business; if he is unable to accommodate guests in July and August that will rise to \u00a3140,000. \u201cGood businesses do not want to see customers missing out. If customers are being offered a full-value credit at a reasonable time \u2013 in other words, a fair swap, that is helping that business survive on really thin wages,\u201d said Handyside, who is also chair of the Professional Association of Self-Caterers (Pasc).</p> <p>In a survey of 900 accommodation owners in the south-west conducted by Pasc and the South West Tourism Alliance, 80% said they would collapse if they had no income through this summer, despite some of them receiving a grant of \u00a310,000 and the prospect of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/27/sunak-backs-down-and-offers-small-firms-100-loan-guarantees\">government-backed rescue loans.</a></p> <p>For Handyside, the biggest frustration has been the failure of insurers to pay out. \u201cMost owners have business interruption insurance, but insurers are refusing coverage,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably going to be one of the big scandals of Covid-19.\u201d The problem is being compounded by the failure of guests\u2019 holiday insurance. Many holidaymakers are being told it\u2019s up to their accommodation provider to compensate them, so holiday-home owners are becoming the \u201cinsurer of last resort\u201d.</p> <p>The \u201cinsurance scandal\u201d, as Handyside puts it, has left small businesses between a rock and a hard place. Many rely on repeat business from customers for the majority of bookings and do not want to jeopardise that loyalty but simply do not have the funds to refund everyone.</p> <p>Handyside said he is fortunate that his business is year-round, so there is a possibility of some recovery later in 2020, but seasonal businesses have already seen half their year wiped out.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an absolute nightmare,\u201d said Jacqueline Saggers who, with her husband, runs <a href=\"https://www.guildengate.co.uk/\">Guilden Gate</a>, a smallholding in Hertfordshire with two glampsites. They have refused all refunds: \u201cNot because we are being difficult but because we are a small family business and would go under if we did, and that doesn\u2019t help anyone.\u201d</p> <p>With only two sites, a VW van and a Hobbit-style shelter, she hasn\u2019t even been able to give all guests the alternative dates they want because that would mean even more loss of income: \u201cIf we took everyone who\u2019s cancelled and put them in July and August, we would have no income. We\u2019re asking them to swap to September and October.\u201d Adding \u201cmost guests are being very accommodating\u201d.</p> <p>The Saggers have received a \u00a310,000 government grant but \u201chave to make it last\u201d until they can start operating again. As to when that might be, there is no clear indication from the government yet. On 28 April, minister for the Cabinet Office, Michael Gove, announced that tourist hotspots will be off-limits<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/28/uk-lockdown-rules-restrictions-coronavirus/\"> </a>\u201cfor some time to come\u201d. Two days later, prime minister Boris Johnson told the daily briefing that it was important to \u201cget tourism going again\u201d, but not to the extent that \u201can influx of people would create a second wave of the disease\u201d. Johnson said a \u201croadmap\u201d for unlocking various parts of the economy will be revealed next week but \u201cdates and times for each individual measure will be driven by where we are in the epidemic and what the data is saying\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a812b48ba4ef05994866da1380a6d1abdb9a5dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a812b48ba4ef05994866da1380a6d1abdb9a5dd/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cambrian Escapes exterior with wisteria\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The owner of Cambrian Escapes is \u201cworking on the basis that the summer\u2019s gone\u201d</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Duncan Jordan, owner of <a href=\"https://www.cambrianescapes.co.uk/\">Cambrian Escapes</a> near Llandovery in Carmarthenshire, which had been running for just under a year when the crisis struck, said: \u201cWe\u2019re working on the basis that the summer\u2019s gone. We\u2019re hoping it isn\u2019t, but when you hear the news, the work that needs to go in to helping people accept visitors and incomers into the community is huge.\u201d</p> <p>Others are more hopeful that tourism businesses will be able to operate at some level from July onwards. \u201cThe worst case scenario is being shut down and not being able to operate until next year,\u201d said Malcom Bell, head of Visit Cornwall, a region where one in five jobs are in tourism and one in three homes depend in some way on the tourism sector.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we need is not to open a day too early or a day too late \u2013 we have to get this right,\u201d said Bell. \u201cThere will be compromises: how do you make sure businesses are compliant? How do you give customer and community assurance? And how you minimise any risk to visitors?\u201d</p> <p>Measures currently being considered to ensure Cornwall can safely welcome visitors include timed-ticketing at attractions to control numbers, vehicle restrictions in towns to keep numbers of visitors at a manageable level, and even a change in the law requiring holidaymakers to have documentation proving they are allowed to visit. \u201cThese might be seen as draconian, but let\u2019s not rule them out at the moment,\u201d said Bell. \u201cThe alternative is to keep everything shut \u2013 but we have businesses in despair, it\u2019s causing mental health issues. We have to come up with a solution to help the economy while minimising the risks to visitors and the community.\u201d</p> <p>In the meantime, owners facing the potential loss of their livelihoods are trying to stay positive. \u201cAt the moment the land is heavenly. The wildlife is incredible,\u201d said Jacqueline Saggers at Guilden Gate. \u201cBut I can\u2019t wait to be able to share it again with guests.\u201d</p>",

Associated Newspapers denies the claims.</p> <p>Delivering his ruling on Friday, Mr Justice Warby struck out allegations that the publisher had acted \u201cdishonestly\u201d by leaving out certain passages of the letter.</p> <p>He also struck out allegations that the publisher deliberately \u201cstirred up\u201d issues between Meghan and her father, and that it had an \u201cagenda\u201d of publishing intrusive or offensive stories about her.</p> <p>Those allegations should not form part of the duchess\u2019s case at this stage, he said, because they were \u201cirrelevant\u201d to her claim for misuse of private information, copyright infringement and breach of the Data Protection Act.</p> <p>But he said those parts of her case may be revived at a later stage, if they are put on a proper legal basis.</p> <p>\u201cSome of the allegations are struck out as irrelevant to the purpose for which they are pleaded,\u201d said the judge in a written ruling.</p> <p>\u201cSome are struck out on the further or alternative ground that they are inadequately detailed. I have also acted so as to confine the case to what is reasonably necessary and proportionate for the purpose of doing justice between these parties.</p> <p>\u201cI do not consider that the allegations struck out on that basis go to the \u2018heart\u2019 of the case, which at its core concerns the publication of five articles disclosing the words of, and information drawn from, the letter written by the claimant to her father in August 2018.\u201d</p> <p>Schillings, the law firm representing the duchess said the ruling made it very clear that the core elements of the case do not change, saying: \u201cThe duchess\u2019s rights were violated; the legal boundaries around privacy were crossed.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson added: \u201cWhilst the judge recognises that there is a claim for breach of privacy and copyright, we are surprised to see that his ruling suggests that dishonest behaviour is not relevant.\u201d</p> <p>The action by the duchess focuses on five articles \u2013 two in the Mail on Sunday, and three on Mail Online \u2013 reproducing parts of the letters, with the headline on one reading: \u201cRevealed: The letter showing the true tragedy of Meghan\u2019s rift with a father she says has \u2018broken her heart into a million pieces\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>During a hearing last month, which was heard remotely before a virtual court hearing in London, lawyers for Meghan accused the Mail of \u201cstirring up\u201d issues between the duchess and Markle, then using it to justify publishing a \u201cprivate and confidential\u201d letter.</p> <p>She was said to have been distressed at the realisation that Associated Newspapers had an agenda of \u201cintrusive and offensive\u201d stories about her.</p> <p>But counsel for the publisher argued that allegations of \u201cdishonesty and malicious intent\u201d were not relevant in a misuse of private information case. Claims that the newspaper had \u201charassed, humiliated, manipulated and exploited\u201d her were \u201cremarkable\u201d given that she had not contacted her father to ask if he agreed, he added.</p> <p>The ruling was a \u201ctotal loss\u201d for Meghan, according to Mark Stephens, a libel and privacy expert at the law firm Howard Kennedy, who said that the judge had struck out a \u201csignificant but ill-informed\u201d part of her claim.</p> <p>She now faced paying between \u00a3200,000 to \u00a3250,000 in costs for pursuing what he described as \u201ca wide-ranging attack on the media,\u201d and the prospect of being cross-examined during the case about the way she and friends \u201ccurated\u201d her reputation.</p> <p>\u201cShe had a very simple and quite strong \u2013 on the face of it \u2013 case of privacy, because it was a confidential letter written from an estranged daughter to an estranged father. It has now pared back to a privacy and copyright claim,\u201d Stephens added.</p> <p>Another lawyer, Jonathan Coad of Coad Law, said the newspaper had scored a tactical victory by paring down the claim, which he said had been \u201cover-egged\u201d in a way that had not stood up to the forensic scrutiny of the court.</p> <p>\u201cThis will all contribute to the exertion of pressure by the MoS on Ms Markle to abandon her claim,\u201d he added.</p> <p>But the campaign group Hacked Off said that the judgment would make no difference to the substantial claim for misuse of private information.</p> <p>Nathan Sparkes, the policy director at Hacked Off, said: \u201cHarry and Meghan have been dragged through the mud by the Mail, which has waged a campaign of intrusion and abuse against Ms Markle in particular.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Candidates in their dressing gowns, dogs and children running about, partners in the background watching TV, or piles of dirty washing up on the kitchen counter \u2013 with 25 years in the recruitment sector, David Stone has heard it all when it comes to disastrous video interviews. \u201cWhen people are working at home, because it\u2019s your personal space, a lot of candidates completely overlook the fact that it\u2019s still a formal first meeting,\u201d Stone, the founder of <a href=\"https://www.mrlcg.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">MRL Consulting Group</a>, says. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what you see going on in the background.\u201d</p> <p>Holding interviews remotely \u2013 whether by phone or video \u2013 isn\u2019t a new concept, particularly for companies that have built remote, international teams. Nor is the use of technology in the recruitment process, with an influx of artificial-intelligence tools that source and screen candidates hitting the market in recent years. There are algorithms that can analyse candidates\u2019 tone of voice, facial expressions, and speech patterns during video pre-assessments, scoring them against an ideal profile for that role. Graduates have <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/ai-interviews-city-jobs-graduates-a3951296.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">reportedly spent thousands of pounds</a> learning how to beat these systems.</p> <p>But for many companies, still recruiting during the global Covid-19 lockdown, moving the process online can be a daunting prospect. Stone recommends all involved \u2013 recruiter and candidate \u2013 treat a remote interview like a traditional, face-to-face meeting as much as possible. \u201cGet up, get showered, put a suit on,\u201d he says. \u201cPay consideration to what can be seen on that camera behind you. Make sure you\u2019ve got an hour\u2019s worth of peace and quiet.\u201d Some candidates may be more nervous appearing on video than they would be in person, he adds. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to try and get past that.

Do they give me confidence?\u201d</p> <p>While recruiters may prefer to do the first round of remote interviews over the phone, Wilson says it is important to see the person you\u2019re speaking to at some stage in the process. That doesn\u2019t have to be via a bespoke HR platform \u2013 video conference tools such as Zoom, Skype, and Microsoft Teams work just as well. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to be working remotely, you also need to be reassured they have the right set-up at home,\u201d she adds. \u201cI check that they have a dedicated desk area, they have an appropriate seat, and it looks free from distraction.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1ed6b7031113c9a3e3eaeace2745dc4cc91b48a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1ed6b7031113c9a3e3eaeace2745dc4cc91b48a/0_247_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young woman teleconferencing on laptop on conference call\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Recruiters may use a video interview to check that candidates have suitable workspace at home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drazen_/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Candidates and interviewers alike should switch on all equipment 15 minutes beforehand, think about getting the lighting and camera angle right, test microphones, and put phones and any push notifications on silent, says <a href=\"https://www.tranceformationstm.com/about.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">flexible working consultant and executive coach</a> Marilyn Devonish. \u201cWhen speaking, look directly into the camera so the other person feels like you\u2019re looking at them,\u201d she adds, rather than getting distracted by your own image on the screen (Zoom has a \u201chide myself\u201d option, which can help).

  "<p>Whether it\u2019s your first job after teacher training or you\u2019re an experienced hand, evaluating a potential school is a crucial part of the interview process. But how do you do that remotely? Here are top tips for teachers applying to work at a new school under lockdown.</p> <p><strong>Prepare for remote interviews</strong><br>Although the coronavirus pandemic presents us with many challenges, it\u2019s worth remembering that schools and supply agencies have been recruiting teachers online for almost 20 years. Independent and English language international schools are increasingly recruiting teachers via video to work with them overseas. The current lockdown has forced all schools across the UK to reconsider how they recruit teachers.</p> <p><strong>Be tech-ready<br></strong>On both sides of the camera it is critical to check the video technology, the microphone and your background environment when conducting an interview via video. What apps will they be using? Have you used them before? If not, rehearse with a friend.</p> <p><strong>Think the process through<br></strong>It is crucial to find a school which best meets your needs. Find as many schools as possible before you begin any application process. This will give you motivation, as well as building up a network for future job opportunities.</p> <p><strong>Visit the school \u2013 virtually<br></strong>In order to determine which type of environment you feel most comfortable with, one important planning aspect to consider is your journey to and from the school, should you be successfully appointed. Under normal circumstances it\u2019s worth considering a trial journey during peak commuter hours to see if the journey is manageable. Under the current conditions, it\u2019s worth trying to arrange for a virtual tour of the school site \u2013 just as you would for a position that involves relocating to the other side of the country, or an international job. A conscientious school leader should be more than happy to take candidates on a video tour. This is even more critical during lockdown when all schools are struggling with recruitment.</p> <p><strong>Prepare your application<br></strong>Look at the key facts listed on the job advert, and evaluate how they match up with the person specification \u2013 not the job description. Think carefully about what you can offer the school. Initial research on examination performance, pupil demographics and inspection reports will help you identify key priorities in the application. It would also be wise to consider why you want to work at the school. For more on this, see the <a href=\"https://www.teachertoolkit.co.uk/2018/03/25/the-5-minute-interview-plan-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">five-minute interview plan</a>. Regarding referees and references, it is always worth asking permission and giving those key people a \u201cheads-up\u201d. References are frequently requested with limited time for the referee to respond, putting them under pressure. You don\u2019t want to put your job application in jeopardy!</p> <p><strong>Submitting your application <br></strong>Spellcheck, spellcheck, spellcheck!<strong> </strong>Whatever you do, do not copy and paste bog-standard educational cliches and fire off application after application without due diligence. I\u2019ve seen thousands of applications thrown in the bin because they accidentally mention another school\u2019s name, have grammatical errors or include inappropriate information (no one needs to know your astrological birth sign!). Ask a friend to proofread your application. Show the reader that you have conducted some research, posing questions and thoughts, as well as some solutions with evidence of things that you have contributed towards in your current role. Remember, you can discuss finer details during the interview, so keep the facts concise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e878c1d4c404b4cb10389db895182a8f2f30f50a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e878c1d4c404b4cb10389db895182a8f2f30f50a/0_132_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young woman sitting at table at home using cell phone and laptop taking notes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ask direct questions to make sure the school\u2019s right for you.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Plan your questions </strong><br>The easiest way to discover if a school leadership team is on track is to ask direct questions at the interview. For example: \u201cHow many teachers left your school last year?\u201d \u201cHow much of the overall budget does the school protect for professional development?\u2019\u2019 \u201cWhy should I work at your school?\u201d \u201cIs the school budget in deficit, if so by how much?\u201d If these questions are avoided, it\u2019s a good indication that this might not be the school for you.</p> <p><strong>Nail that interview!<br></strong>Be prepared, rehearse potential questions and answers, pick out what you will wear on the day \u2013 even for an online interview. Show interest and be conscientious by keeping your questions and answers concise. Whatever you do, do not be late: in an online interview, there really are no traffic excuses.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/the-abcs-of-recruiting-teachers-remotely/2020/may/01/teacher-training-how-do-you-prepare-to-teach-a-new-class-during-lockdown\">Teacher training: how do you prepare to teach a new class during lockdown?</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Have your answers ready<br></strong>Be prepared to answer a range of challenging questions, and rehearse a variety of scenarios where you can provide concise answers.

Where do you want to be in three years\u2019 time? Why do you want to work in this school?

  "<p>If you are a teacher looking to move between schools during the coronavirus lockdown, how can you make the most of the online education experience with your new class? This is interesting new territory for many teachers. But there are thousands and thousands of teachers and pupils already learning remotely, in virtual schools \u2013 can they offer insights?</p> <p>At a virtual school, lessons are delivered in line with each person\u2019s personalised curriculum. Exactly as you would expect in a physical school space, pupils are taught how to interact with teachers, their peers and lesson content using whiteboard technology, quizzes, voice and video as well as receiving and sending assignment tasks. How should you introduce yourself to a new class, if you are meeting them online for the first time? If we consider how teachers deliver excellent classroom teaching practice in a physical space, how they prepare should not be approached any differently in an online environment.</p> <h2>Flipped learning</h2> <p>\u201cFlipped learning\u201d is a term used to describe how teachers can provide material for pupils to learn outside of the classroom. Although this is traditionally considered homework or coursework and typically completed without the teacher, increasingly this approach to enhance learning outside of the classroom has been set and completed online. During lockdown, teachers will be focusing on core curriculum content, meeting the needs of vulnerable pupils as well as enhancing student engagement, mixing between activities, types of assignments and differentiation techniques to support a range of pupils. One factor that must be considered for teachers who are working remotely, is how they can mix online teaching and learning with traditional methods that would be used in the physical classroom. A good tip for teachers working online, especially from home, is to have a simple whiteboard behind the camera and teach just as you would in a physical classroom space. Doing this over a sustained period of time will definitely present a new challenge, but it\u2019s possible with well-thought-out curriculum plans, and a simple range of equipment.</p> <h2>Blended learning</h2> <p>Blended learning, first developed in the 1960s, was a method of instruction using technology-mediated methods. With flipped learning being the norm during lockdown, what can teachers learn from other educators who are already working in blended learning environments \u2013 teachers working in virtual schools, or online tutors?</p> <p>If we look towards Barak Rosenshine\u2019s 17 recommendations for effective teaching, these can quite easily be reapplied to online teaching, delivered through (at least) video conferencing. At the start of every lesson, review the last lesson with a simple retrieval exercise. This supports long-term retention, can easily be deployed with a simple quiz or competition and is a guaranteed way to get a lesson off to a flying start.</p> <p>When presenting new material, successful teachers teach by giving a series of short presentations using many examples. Teachers should also provide guided practice by modelling various techniques. Where teachers present too much material at once, this will confuse pupils. Working online without sufficient verbal and non-verbal cues, means it will be critical for teachers to regularly check student responses.</p> <p>One way that teachers can do this is to ask a large number of questions. Feedback can be provided by giving prompts, modelling and guiding pupils as they develop independent practice and asking simple questions such as \u201cwho, where, why and how\u201d to help shape pupils\u2019 thinking. When teachers check frequently to see if all students are learning, this processes information into long-term memory, developing schematic concepts to support retention. Teaching remotely, whether using Microsoft Teams, Google Suite or other platforms, gives teachers a significant array of strategies to deploy at this interesting time.</p> <p>Finally, research recommends that teachers should try \u201cscaffold learning\u201d, helping pupils to problem-solve by thinking out loud and providing cognitive support. This can be achieved by completing the work alongside pupils; doing this online may require teachers to use \u201cbreakout spaces\u201d by waiting to provide individual feedback in live video conferencing lessons.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"affba1b5e1a0f99cc5f040e4b8cef0a1709f255e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/affba1b5e1a0f99cc5f040e4b8cef0a1709f255e/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young student watching lesson online and studying from home.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Teachers delivering lessons from home should have a simple whiteboard behind them and teach just as they would in a physical classroom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jovanmandic/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Flexibility and personalisation</h2> <p>Every student should be treated as an individual online as all teachers would in a physical space, and with teachers working remotely, they will need to learn how to use technology as well as adapt content to meet individual needs. If you are meeting your pupils for the first time, I would recommend sending them a survey, asking them to complete simple questions so that you can elicit initial information about their interests, abilities and hopes. You can then start to plan which interventions you will use in your lesson planning and delivery.</p> <p>To help support increased teacher workload, my key recommendation would be that if teachers are able to connect with the pupils online, it is important to allow students to engage in a weekly and monthly review of their learning to support long-term memory. Often this manifests itself when a pupil says: \u201cWe\u2019ve done this before!\u201d But effective teachers will remind pupils that this is a retrieval practice exercise to assist with long-term retention.</p> <h2>Safeguarding and security</h2> <p>If you are joining a virtual school, then I would assume the various safeguarding procedures are already in place. However, if you now find yourself teaching pupils online for the first time, having never met them physically, you should double-check to ensure that your new school has considered data protection, child protection, internet security and the various online safeguarding procedures for teachers and pupils.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/the-abcs-of-recruiting-teachers-remotely/2020/may/01/how-to-conduct-a-remote-interview-seven-tips-for-schools-hiring-teachers\">How to conduct a remote interview: seven tips for schools hiring teachers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When teaching from your own home environment, it is worth reflecting on your own safeguarding procedures. For example, if you have not yet physically reached your new school, have you received any induction, or has the designated safeguarding officer spoken with you about induction procedures? Of the students in your register, which have specific learning needs that require initial conversations with your special needs coordinator or associated form tutors? All these balances and checks would be done physically on entry to a new school; just because you are doing this remotely, doesn\u2019t mean that they should not happen.</p> <h2>Creating a supportive, online environment</h2> <p>What should teachers consider when meeting their pupils online? Many schools will assign home-learning tasks through software or an online curriculum portal, which parents can access. Other schools will have their teachers and pupils log on to a secure platform, to complete assignments, submit work and interact with the teacher through voice or text. Some schools will be offering live video lessons with pupils, teaching from the home environment or from their school classrooms.</p> <p>If we look towards countries such as South Korea and Singapore, where teachers have an almost celebrity-like online presence, it\u2019s common to find them sharing videos, teaching lessons through YouTube or having millions of viewers on Instagram.</p> <p><em>If you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to <a href=\"https://recruiters.theguardian.com/coronavirus-education-offer?utm_source=odpy&amp;utm_medium=dispad&amp;utm_campaign=we_support_schools&amp;CMP_TU=jbsr&amp;CMP_BUNIT=jobs\">recruiters.theguardian.com</a> and if you are seeking a new role at a school please visit <a href=\"https://jobs.theguardian.com/jobs/schools/?INTCMP=gdnwb_editorial_editorial_jobs_teachers_content_\">our jobsite</a></em></p>",
  "<p>As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, more schools than ever are recruiting new teachers online. How can you prepare effectively to make the most of the remote interview process? This handy seven-point guide will help you keep in mind the questions you should be asking any potential new members of your staffroom. The teachers on your candidate shortlist might know their ABCs from their hypotenuses \u2013 but what do you need to do to get the best out of them in a remote interview?</p> <p><strong>1. Prepare your questions \u2013 and answers<br></strong>An online interview is like any other \u2013 make sure you\u2019ve set your interview agenda. If you\u2019re interviewing with another member of staff make sure you\u2019ve decided who will ask what questions \u2013 and also, who will answer any questions from your candidates. Key questions you should be prepared to answer would include: What makes the school unique? What does the school need to improve? Does the school provide personalised, professional development? How would pupils, parents and other teachers describe your school? And be prepared to include a range of pupils and teachers in the recruitment process. Those who do this now should find themselves ahead of the recruitment process.</p> <p><strong>2. Find a quiet space</strong> <br>When you\u2019re conducting the interview make sure you\u2019re in a quiet space, with a background that is tidy and clear. It\u2019s also worth considering how you position your microphone and camera lens so that you can present yourself from the waist upwards. Simple stuff I know, but you\u2019d be surprised how many do not consider camera angle and lighting positioning. It could make the difference in a successful appointment!</p> <p><strong>3. Ensure your technology is up to date <br></strong>It\u2019s worth making sure your browser is running the latest updates and that you\u2019ve got a reliable broadband connection. Check both camera and microphone are working with your fellow teachers before you are on an interview video call. It\u2019s worth giving candidates details of the technology you use in advance of your interview, so they have time to familiarise themselves with the differences between Zoom, Skype, Google Hangouts or Microsoft Teams.</p> <p><strong>4. Prepare to multitask<br></strong>Learn how to speak to the camera lens, make notes as well as use the video technology to navigate between your camera, the screen and the microphone. When you are not speaking, for example, you may wish to mute your microphone so that the interviewee does not hear any distracting background noises. If you take time to rehearse, this will also help schools make better appointments today rather than after discovering where and how the technology lets you down.</p> <p><strong>5. Offer to let candidates speak to colleagues <br></strong>Once you have set the interview agenda it can be helpful to arrange for an informal meeting with colleagues already working at the school. Select a range of teachers who best represent your school, to show your potential as a good employer. For example, a member of the support staff, the school receptionist, a member of staff who has just joined the school and a member of staff who is leaving the school. You\u2019re looking to give an indication of the school\u2019s culture. This may be difficult to achieve remotely, but it\u2019s not impossible. Plan to have this in place, now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20e0bc67de86c82508cf3fe353434fa15b6833f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20e0bc67de86c82508cf3fe353434fa15b6833f3/0_342_5224_3135/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Teenage boy in his bedroom using laptop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Try and involve pupils, either with a pupil interview or an online lesson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Drury/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>6. Offer a pupil interview if possible<br></strong>Technology may also be able to offer the capacity for a pupil interview experience, or perhaps even an online lesson for the candidates to teach with the panel observing as part of the application process. If you are able to provide the opportunity for candidates to teach a lesson online, it\u2019s critical to offer as much information about the lesson and the children for it to be an effective exercise. Of course, during a pandemic, going about teaching online will be immensely different from teaching face-to-face: watch to see how teachers engage the pupils in a virtual classroom. How do candidates communicate effectively through a camera lens? Can they question, hold to account, and provide feedback to pupils online?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/the-abcs-of-recruiting-teachers-remotely/2020/may/01/the-new-rules-of-remote-recruiting-how-to-prepare-for-an-online-interview\">The new rules of remote recruiting: how to prepare for an online interview</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>7. Can you offer a virtual tour?<br></strong>One of the key opportunities at interview is a tour of the school. Doing this remotely presents a significant challenge, but again, those innovative school leaders will already be working ahead of the bell curve. Beyond the school website, most schools will have a range of images of events taking place on site, with photo galleries and online videos. It\u2019s worth making sure your school\u2019s social media strategy shares positive news stories with the general public, as well as pupils and parents, and prospective teachers. With most schools open during Covid-19 in a limited capacity, there will be an option for school leadership teams who are currently on-site to provide applicants with a virtual tour of the school facilities, classrooms and office spaces.

  "<p>It was a low-key comeback. After a week in hospital, and two more spent recuperating at Chequers, the prime minister\u2019s official country residence, Boris Johnson arrived at Downing Street last weekend in an inconspicuous Volkswagen mini-van. He slipped inside. There was no victory sign or cheerful wave.</p> <p>For an unprecedented period, the prime minister had been missing. He was either laid low from his coronavirus symptoms, in intensive care in St Thomas\u2019 hospital in Westminster, or recovering from what the tabloids called his \u201cbrush with death\u201d. It was clear that few major government decisions had been made in Johnson\u2019s long absence.</p> <p>Now, according to aides, he was \u201craring to go\u201d; he was ready to \u201ctake control\u201d of government affairs and to \u201cbounce back\u201d. The country, not to mention deferential cabinet colleagues, were waiting for some answers. Was Johnson in favour of easing lockdown? When and how might this happen? And were his laissez-faire instincts a thing of the past?</p> <p>There were personal questions, too. Namely, whether Johnson\u2019s experience of grave illness had recast his personality for the better. In the pre-virus days, the serious politician played second fiddle to the crowd-pleasing comedian and columnist. Now, some saw Johnson taking on a new persona befitting our pandemic-shaped age: that of a statesman.</p> <p>On Monday, for instance, the Times reported an unnamed cabinet minister saying his illness \u201chas changed him \u2026 He now has an emotional connection to the NHS that you don\u2019t get from anything except a near-death experience.\u201d</p> <p>The early signals, though, were mixed. At 9am on Monday morning Johnson appeared in front of Downing Street. His five-minute speech showed a man labouring to breathe as he spoke. His clothes seemed to hang off him \u2013 his appearance and demeanour a physical embodiment of the effects of the infection.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c87e549636e14dead7049ba556c6bfaebd2da397\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c87e549636e14dead7049ba556c6bfaebd2da397/0_170_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson arriving back at Downing Street from hospital after the birth of his baby son.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson arriving back at Downing Street from hospital after the birth of his baby son.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Parsons/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He gave no hint as to when schools and non-essential shops might reopen and some measure of normal life resume.</p> <p>Nor was there acknowledgement \u2013 tacit or otherwise \u2013 that his time away had clarified his thinking, or made him inclined to choose this moment to \u201clevel with the country\u201d, as he has previously promised to do, about the decisions that have been taken, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/uk-government-coronavirus-science-who-advice\">potential mistakes that have been made</a> over the timing of the lockdown.</p> <p>He swerved around the questions about the lockdown, the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/28/gp-coronavirus-no-ppe-guilty-angry\"> lack of personal protective equipment</a> (PPE) and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/27/the-guardian-view-on-coronavirus-tests-ideology-has-hurt-the-uk\">chaos over testing</a>. </p> <p>Instead, Johnson asked the nation for patience. \u201cI believe we are coming now to the end of the first phase of the conflict\u201d, he said. There seemed to be deliberate echoes here of Churchill\u2019s famous second world war speech about the \u201cend of the beginning\u201d. Johnson offered further flourishes. The disease \u2013 as he himself knew \u2013 was \u201can invisible mugger\u201d. Thanks to our collective efforts, Britain had \u201cwrestled it to the ground\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/30/the-guardian-view-on-johnsons-covid-19-plan-doubt-deny-and-dismiss\">The Guardian view on Johnson's Covid-19 plan: doubt, deny and dismiss | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The phrase didn\u2019t really capture the grim and multitudinous truth. By Monday more than 20,000 people had officially died of the virus \u2013 in hospitals, care centres, or in quiet agony at home, surrounded by loved ones. They were not so much mugged as extinguished before their time. By the end of the week the official tally was 27,000-plus, and probably much higher.</p> <p>To his critics, who have included normally loyal supporters in the rightwing media, there are still searching questions about the prime minister\u2019s decisions in late February and March \u2013 or lack of them.</p> <p>By <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/30/coronavirus-deaths-how-does-britain-compare-with-other-countries\">some analyses</a>, the UK is on track to have the highest death rate in Europe. Other countries, led by Germany and Denmark, have done much better. Were they less complacent and more organised?

He was due for the first time to face up to Sir Keir Starmer, the new Labour leader. But the evening before, Downing Street wouldn\u2019t say whether Johnson planned to turn up, which was odd.There was speculation Johnson might still be somewhat unwell.</p> <p>In fact, something else was going on. On Wednesday morning, Johnson was at his partner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/29/carrie-symonds-a-media-savvy-history-maker-in-no-10\">Carrie Symonds</a>\u2019 side as she gave birth to a baby boy at an NHS hospital. It was the latest dramatic event in what had been an extraordinary period for Johnson, several lives squashed into one almost: Brexit, Covid-19, and the unparalleled shut-down of national life.</p> <p>A photo taken on the stairs of Downing Street showed a grinning Johnson, back from his fiancee\u2019s bedside. He looks elated and nobody could begrudge the couple their happiness. Well-wishers noted babies change people for the better; cynics pointed out that Johnson has been a father five \u2013 or more \u2013 times before, and that this arrival might prove a distraction from the tasks ahead.</p> <p>In the nine months since he became PM, Johnson has<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/revealed-the-inside-story-of-uk-covid-19-coronavirus-crisis\"> frequently seemed semi-engaged</a>. Over New Year he had a holiday in the Caribbean. In February he spent 12 days at Chevening, the government\u2019s estate in Kent, missing five Cobra meetings as Covid-19 spread from China. Reportedly he took weekends off.</p> <p>Former colleagues have joked Johnson prefers to do many things badly, rather than one thing well \u2013 more of a chairman than a CEO.</p> <p>Downing Street aides say this is wrong. They insist Johnson is devoting his full attention to the coronavirus crisis. One ministerial adviser said he was busier at the end of his time off than was admitted. He asked for submissions on a whole range of issues, not just Covid-19. His time in hospital reignited his desire to take care of the NHS, and to get back to work, the adviser said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8d5f2e3810864b71155e573ad27e4581a2588bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8d5f2e3810864b71155e573ad27e4581a2588bd/14_0_2124_1275/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson chairs his first digital cabinet meeting at No 10, on 30 April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson chairs his first digital cabinet meeting at No 10, on 30 April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Parsons/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Johnson is now determined to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/27/boris-johnson-uk-beginning-to-turn-the-tide-on-coronavirus\">turn the tide</a>\u201d on the virus by mid-June, officials suggest. In his absence ministers have argued about the right way forward. Johnson is keen to take back control of the political situation, officials stress, and is reportedly annoyed at leaks suggesting the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/advisers-warn-over-coronavirus-lockdown-relaxation-amid-cabinet-split\">cabinet is split</a> between pro-economy hawks and cautious lockdown doves.</p> <p>So what next? Before falling sick, Johnson could be counted among those who were bullish about the prospect of easing restrictions and returning to business as usual relatively quickly.</p> <p>Multiple sources with knowledge of his thinking say some of that optimism has faded. They says this partly reflects his own experiences in intensive care \u2013 but also the changing scientific picture presented to him.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been briefing from some close to No 10 against Matt [Hancock]. But the truth is the PM\u2019s position is much closer to Matt\u2019s than those pushing for measures to be lifted.

And more hesitant than usual, misreading the figure for deaths.</p> <p>And again, he chose not to address the questions that have been asked of him personally, or his government.</p> <p>So far, neither he, nor anybody in his top team, has wanted to meet the challenge set them by Intisar Chowdhury, the 18-year-old son of an NHS doctor who died with coronavirus.

The UK had passed the peak of the disease. It was was on a downward slope. He promised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/30/britain-is-past-peak-of-coronavirus-outbreak-says-boris-johnson\">details next week</a> of how lockdown might end. There would be a \u201croadmap\u201d and a \u201cmenu of options\u201d.</p> <p>There was a warning, too. Johnson likened the pandemic to a pleasant European motoring holiday that had got into unexpected difficulty. Britain was driving through a \u201chuge Alpine tunnel\u201d. Ahead were \u201csunlight and pasture\u201d. It needed to keep control, lest it run into a \u201csecond and bigger mountain\u201d. </p> <p>He claimed the UK had avoided the tragedy that had engulfed other places.

His popularity ratings are high. The country, polls suggest, is inclined to give him the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/28/happiness-increasing-boris-johnson-coronavirus\">benefit of the doubt</a>, at least for now, while the virus is still a threat and the NHS is under great strain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/lack-of-logic-in-boris-johnsons-claims-on-lockdown-and-coronavirus-peak\">Lack of logic in Boris Johnson\u2019s claims on lockdown and coronavirus \u2018peak\u2019 | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The new baby will generate further goodwill.

The United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) has <a href=\"https://www.supermarketnews.com/issues-trends/ufcw-more-5000-food-industry-employees-not-work-due-coronavirus\">said</a> that at least 72 of its members have died from coronavirus, and thousands more may be infected; because of the lack of tests, no one knows the true number. Despite <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/presidents-intelligence-briefing-book-repeatedly-cited-virus-threat/2020/04/27/ca66949a-8885-11ea-ac8a-fe9b8088e101_story.html\">repeated warnings</a> in the presidential briefing books months ago, nobody instructed industry to gear up or how.</p> <p>In Storm Lake, Iowa, center of the densest livestock-producing region in America, none of the roughly 2,500 pork and turkey processing workers at Tyson Foods plants have been tested for the coronavirus. Hence, Buena Vista county reports only four cases so far, while nearby red meat hub Sioux City is the hottest spot in the USA. Workers\u2019 temperatures are checked. If they feel sick they are advised to stay home. They are told to space out and not crowd into the locker rooms. Plastic hangs between workers on the line. Tyson says it is doing all it can by staggering breaks and spacing workers.</p> <p>Iowa\u2019s governor, Kim Reynolds, a Republican, directed testing resources to Tyson\u2019s Waterloo plant. There, workers are represented by the UFCW. The local sheriff said he wanted a boot slammed down on the slaughterhouse. But in Storm Lake, testing is limited to healthcare and nursing home workers and patients. None for the packinghouse crowd, who are overwhelmingly Latino and non-union.</p> <p>Before the order they did their duty and clocked in. Nobody had to threaten them. They need the check. If you report sick with the virus, you might imagine finding yourself on the next bus to Ju\u00e1rez whether you have papers or not. They want to work \u2013 safely.</p> <p>Tyson says that its workers are documented. But Trump and the likes of the Iowa congressman Steve King, the race-baiting Republican, have Latino workers shaking in their boots. The governor warns that if a plant reopens and you don\u2019t show up, unemployment benefits cease. And then the president orders that the plants shall reopen come hell or a virus. The leaders of the big meatpackers are warning of spot meat shortages \u2013 plant capacity has dropped 40% in recent weeks from worker shortages. You just can\u2019t let this Storm Lake plant shut down. But what happens if it explodes? The anxiety cuts to our quick.</p> <p>Remember, too, that Smithfield Foods is owned by a Chinese conglomerate. Prestage Farms, in Eagle Grove, Iowa, has taken to sending whole hog carcasses to China for lack of further processing help amid our cornfields. This is not really an American food shortage.</p> <p>The supply chain is so tight that when two plants go down \u2013 Smithfield in Sioux Falls and Tyson in Waterloo \u2013 fully 10% of national pork production is knocked out. Everyone has to eat, and they have not yet developed a taste for algae or even tofu. The world eats meat. Shoppers can clear out a grocery display in minutes, and a meat supply in a week.</p> <p>Somebody has to process the hogs and birds that keep coming no matter a virus. Mike Pence called our neighbors heroes. The secretary of agriculture, Sonny Perdue, called them patriots. Trump stopped legal residency permitting for immigrants. Nobody is talking about amnesty or even hearing the refugees. In fact, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa told Bloomberg Law nobody is talking about providing undocumented workers healthcare.</p> <p>The state and federal governments did not order slower line speeds or provide protective gear for the packinghouse. Tyson asked for imposed guidance and resources, and got a promise of liability protection from worker claims. But there is this sticky thing called the 10th amendment that does not allow the president to waive corporate liabilities in state courts or workers\u2019 compensation processes, says Storm Lake attorney Willis Hamilton, who has been advocating for food processing employees for nearly 50 years. The order was about instilling fear, Hamilton said. He says his clients are afraid of sick leave and afraid of filing for workers\u2019 comp or unemployment.</p> <p>\u201cThey have to threaten people. These \u2018don\u2019t even think about it\u2019 orders fit into a system that marches workers to their deaths,\u201d Case said. \u201cFear is turning to anger, and that\u2019s when people organize.\u201d</p> <p>Or just pray.</p> <ul> <li><p>Art Cullen is editor of the Storm Lake Times in north-west Iowa, where he won the Pulitzer prize for editorial writing.

An hour later he was standing in my living room, taking measurements. \u201cI think we can make it work,\u201d he chirped. Next I called Wolfgang Bergmann, the head of the German section of Arte, a magnificent Franco-German television channel that lives and breathes culture as a public broadcaster. He and I had discussed many broadcasting ideas in the past. Would I be interested in a livestream? he asked. \u201cOnly if it is with top-notch sound,\u201d I replied. \u201cCan you start tomorrow?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>I told him he was mad, and he said yes, but that I was even madder. He sent over two creative directors who within hours built a set in my living room, brought in beautiful art nouveau lighting to match the existing decor, and worked out how to turn our idea into reality. At this point we were still allowed to move freely and the production company still had permission to film, so long as we all kept at least 1.5m apart.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I could never have imagined in my wildest dreams that such an eclectic bevy of artists would pass through my Berlin salon</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We set up two unmanned cameras in addition to the cameraman in the room, thereby limiting how many people were actually in the space at a given time. Fortunately my living room is a fairly large open space which has separate rooms connecting to it. All the editing was done remotely, and the sound team we put in the basement. With a little remote instruction I was able to move the microphones around myself. I call it DIY television.</p> <p>What I needed next was a brilliant pianist who was also an arranger and at the same time able to improvise. Christoph Israel, whom I\u2019ve known for years, fitted the bill perfectly. He had just written the music for an <a href=\"https://www.visitberlin.de/en/event/murder-orient-express\">Agatha Christie production</a>, which had also been cancelled, so he was sitting at home like everyone else, staring at the ceiling. I assembled an enormous list of pieces, he added more, and we spent three hours playing it all through. I don\u2019t think any of us imagined just how much repertoire we would be going through night after night, with barely any rehearsal time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a07961c24c1519f2fcc3964d804ee5da32bd8883\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a07961c24c1519f2fcc3964d804ee5da32bd8883/771_0_864_1080/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jazz trumpeter Till Bro\u0308nner, a guest on Hope@Home.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jazz trumpeter Till Bro\u0308nner, a guest on Hope@Home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ARTE.TV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhat about some guests?\u201d Wolfgang inquired casually after the first episode.

We just went straight in and improvised and learned as we went along. In an early show I did a live Zoom call to one of the city\u2019s leading paediatricians \u2013 I was both concerned and interested to learn how children could be affected by the virus. But as fascinating as it was, we soon realised that people wanted less \u201creality\u201d, so instead I asked people to send in videos of their own homemade music-making.

  "<p>In times of fear, rules go out of the window and the default position is often one of force. A recent doorstep tribute in a Johannesburg suburb to applaud the efforts of essential workers was dubbed an \u201cillegal gathering\u201d by police summoned to break up the event. A resident remarked that it was an eerie reminder of South Africa\u2019s past \u2013 a throwback to the times of apartheid.</p> <p>\u201cThe rules keep changing,\u201d admitted one officer when it was suggested that the response was heavy-handed. No harm was done but the incident highlights the potential shifts in power dynamics that fear brings, as well as the disconnect between good intentions and how they are implemented.</p> <p>In unprecedented times Covid-19 remains an unknown adversary, with the African continent left to second guess its trajectory. So far it has not matched the terrifying numbers in China, North America and Europe, but it is early days.</p> <p>History shows how power thrives on confusion, and trade-offs between freedoms and security. These need to be constantly recalibrated \u2013 and science and politics need to work together. Leaders of 300 African civil society organisations are among 600 globally to have penned an <a href=\"https://www.civicus.org/index.php/media-resources/news/4379-civil-society-s-call-to-states-we-are-in-this-together-don-t-violate-human-rights-while-responding-to-covid-19\">open letter</a> to heads of state urging adherence to the rule of law, warning that all responses should be evidence-based, \u201ctime-bound and proportionate\u201d.</p> <p>In many ways lockdowns echo previous state crackdowns in the wake of terror attacks on the African continent. In Kenya and Uganda, emergency measures in response to violent attacks have amplified excesses of the security services. Covid-19 would appear to be no different; there are reports of killings by security services enforcing lockdowns in Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa. Like the terrorist threats, will the legacy of Covid-19 shape how countries are governed?</p> <p>Although \u2013 in a rare break with tradition \u2013 Kenya\u2019s President Uhuru Kenyatta apologised for overzealous policing, now more than ever the need for tough executive oversight is clear.</p> <p>In South Africa, President Cyril Ramaphosa has blended economic pragmatism with compassion, with a 500bn rand (\u00a322bn) rescue package to support businesses and the vulnerable. His tough lockdown measures received international praise. Yet Ramaphosa\u2019s response has arguably been soured by the revelation that <a href=\"https://www.thedefensepost.com/2020/04/22/south-africa-deploy-73000-troops-covid-19-lockdown/\">73,000</a><a href=\"https://www.thedefensepost.com/2020/04/22/south-africa-deploy-73000-troops-covid-19-lockdown/\"> South African troops</a> \u2013 virtually the entire national defence force \u2013 are to be deployed until the end of June.</p> <p>Military deployment should be a last resort, not a useful governance tool. Soldiers have been used to help build hospitals, distribute food and provide engineering assistance in countries such as the UK and Spain; in South Africa their role appears to be as enforcer. While the South African National Defence Force has a proud history of peacekeeping across the continent, its troops do not belong in the streets or crowded informal settlements. What would be their response to a rowdy food distribution for instance \u2013 restraint or firepower?</p> <p>Monitoring state excesses would traditionally be a job for the media. Journalists in South Africa have been afforded \u201cessential worker\u201d status, but in recent weeks have found themselves under fire. A camerawoman was <a href=\"https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/police-clash-with-joburg-residents-news24-reporter-caught-in-crossfire-20200327\">shot at</a> by police as she tried to capture footage of the lockdown. In Zimbabwe, a court earlier this month derided the police for using Covid-19 as a pretext for media harassment.</p> <p>Many African countries have demonstrated an admirable ability to leverage tech to assist in the Covid-19 response. Examples include bluetooth platforms used for contact tracing in Nigeria, WhatsApp live chats for providing health information in South Africa, and mobile money solutions for welfare payouts in Kenya and Mauritius.</p> <p>South Africa, with its long tradition of human rights struggles, has stopped short of copying South Korea\u2019s introduction of wristbands to track citizens evading lockdown. But in the northern province of Limpopo, the <a href=\"https://dronedj.com/2020/04/13/ai-tagged-drone-footage-of-south-african-lockdown-previews-future-of-technology/\">use of drones</a> by the police as a means of social control has almost gone unnoticed. Surveillance by stealth is a threat to be closely watched.</p> <p>While the assumption is that suspensions of our liberty are bonded with a sunset clause, the danger of \u201cfunction creep\u201d \u2013 where the application of a piece of technology is not as originally intended \u2013 is real. Not least in evolving democracies where oversight institutions are weak.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/01/extreme-coronavirus-lockdown-controls-raise-fears-for-worlds-poorest\">Teargas, beatings and bleach: the most extreme Covid-19 lockdown controls around the world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not wishing to undermine the clear benefits of emerging tech, function creep poses a risk to citizen rights given the fetishisation of, and uncritical reliance on, technology.</p> <p>Imagine if surveillance deployed to track Covid-19 was applied to migrants, alleged terrorists or the LGBT community, branded as undesirables by Uganda? We need to have a \u201ckill switch\u201d so that such technologies are not misused after the pandemic. At the very least we need to start the conversation.

  "<p>The 2001 Philadelphia 76ers are a tall tale that only grows unlikelier with time. The premise flatly stated is absurd: the Sixers built a ballclub around a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1997/08/27/iverson-receives-3-years-probation/293305bc-b1af-4b3f-af73-81aa938e9c6e/\">5ft 11in delinquent from Virginia Beach</a> and it worked. Allen Iverson became the least conventional star ever to lead a team to the NBA finals and the Sixers became the ultimate underdog squad for the ultimate underdog city.</p> <p>From almost the day he arrived in my hometown aged 20, Iverson was plainly one of the NBA\u2019s most transcendent talents, whose scoring instinct was amplified by a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C977RCbuqFk\">new-generation, kill-your-idols edge</a>. His was the perfect game for the teenagers we were: reckless, almost violent, crackling with anarchic energy. It quickly became the greatest show in sports and it was happening right in our backyard. AI was just cool as shit. The whole city loved him. He was a singular but flawed talisman: who could win games by himself but refused to lift or do any real treatment, blew off practice because he was hungover, cursed out the coach and all but begged to be kicked off the team.</p> <p>Yet Iverson\u2019s preposterous feats of bravery \u2013 watching him throw his 160lb frame into the paint, carom off the elbows of linebacker-sized defenders, score a bucket and then bounce off the deck to do it again \u2013 were his nightly penance and absolution for more than a decade. If clean-cut superstars like Jordan and Kobe strived to embody the (false) ideal of perfection, Iverson unapologetically spoke to the frailties innate in us. He was beloved <em>because</em> he was fallible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f01886467e4a692f4c2ac61d5a493b2e0e6e5c27\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f01886467e4a692f4c2ac61d5a493b2e0e6e5c27/0_0_2998_2998/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Allen Iverson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Allen Iverson led the Philadelphia 76ers against all odds against Shaquille O\u2019Neal and the talent-stacked Los Angeles Lakers in the 2001 NBA finals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew D Bernstein/NBAE via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No team before or since has ever made a player that little the focal point and understandably so; deep down we knew the blueprint was doomed. But in 2001, it all came together. The concept was simple: the Sixers surrounded Iverson with <a href=\"https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/PHI/2001.html#all_per_game\">selfless role players</a> who wouldn\u2019t get pissed the smallest guy on the court was chucking up 30 shots a night, their names familiar only because most were on their third or fourth team.</p> <p>The result was Iverson\u2019s finest season. He became the shortest and lightest player ever to be named MVP, and the Sixers won with a lunch-pail style tailor-made for a town where people care a little bit too much about sports. Even as the <a href=\"http://a.espncdn.com/nba/playoffs2001/2001/0612/1213013.html\">injuries mounted</a> during a grueling six-week playoff run \u2013 Iverson\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BryanAGraham/status/1241300454321139712\">own list of ailments</a> became almost comical \u2013 they kept ripping wins away from opponents in low-possession thrillers where your ass was not touching the seat for 70% of the game.</p> <p>The Sixers were given no chance in the finals against the seemingly invincible Los Angeles Lakers, the in-form defending champions led by Shaq and Kobe who hadn\u2019t lost in more than two months. Even at full strength Philadelphia would have had their hands full, but the depleted Mash unit that arrived at the Staples Center for Game 1 of the series was <a href=\"https://lasvegassun.com/news/2001/jun/06/lakers-setting-records-in-sports-books/\">written off entirely</a>.</p> <p>The Lakers immediately showed why, rattling off 16 unanswered points behind the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKICLZfKMG0\">most physically fearsome big man in NBA history</a> at his elemental peak. But after a patchy start Iverson caught fire, slashing and careening to the goal in transition, effortlessly shedding his perimeter defenders out of half-court sets and silencing the Hollywood plastics at courtside. By intermission he\u2019d poured in 30, five off <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_lLwf_QpN8\">Jordan\u2019s finals record for points in a half</a>, as the Sixers built a lead that would swell to 73-58 in the third quarter.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAIfwvhw2Mw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aAIfwvhw2Mw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Allen Iverson delivered one of the one of the great individual performances in NBA finals history against the Lakers in 2001.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>After watching Iverson shred Kobe and Derek Fisher for the first half hour, the Lakers looked <em>way</em> down the bench to Tyronn Lue, the seldom-used point guard who had spent the run-up mimicking Iverson against the Lakers\u2019 first team in practice. Lue harried and hounded Philadelphia\u2019s star relentlessly, denying him the ball or forcing him into contested jumpers. Whether borne from tactical genius or desperation, it was working.</p> <p>With Iverson in check, Shaq at his unstoppable best and my entire city hanging on every loose ball and rebound, the Lakers chipped away and sent the game to overtime. Then comes the part everyone remembers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/05/my-favourite-game-cubs-v-indians-world-series-2016-game-7\">My favourite game: Cubs v Indians, World Series 2016, Game 7</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Sixers are clinging to a two-point lead with about a minute to go when Iverson receives a pass near the corner. He hesitates a half-beat, as if to assess his prey, before crossing over Lue and lofting a stepback jumper that hangs in the air for what seems like ages before ripping through the net, punctuating the coup de gr\u00e2ce with an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grXws5m11SA\">exaggerated high-step</a> over his fallen foil. Forty-eight points, five rebounds, six assists and five steals. Sixers take Game 1, 107-101.</p> <p>It was the apotheosis of the Iverson era and a Whitmanian triumph of the individual, a moment that struck so far beyond sports into the essence of our city\u2019s insurgent soul, validating everything Philadelphia embodies and fiercely protected in our Allen: uncompromising, defiant, self-certain to a fault with a taste for the fight. The <a href=\"https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2001-nba-finals-76ers-vs-lakers.html\">better team won</a> over the best-of-seven series, as happens in basketball, but Iverson\u2019s Game 1 masterclass has come to transcend the outcome in NBA history and define his place in the basketball pantheon: the greatest pound for pound to ever do it and a hell of a player.</p>",

It was later said to contain blood belonging to Sheila Caffell<strong>.</strong></p> <p>On 7 September 1985, Jeremy Bamber\u2019s ex-girlfriend told police Bamber had discussed killing his family with her and that he was involved. On 29 September 1985 Bamber was charged with the murders.</p> <p>After the jury was sent out to reach a verdict, it returned and asked the judge for clarification on the silencer and blood evidence. The judge said it contained only the blood of Sheila Caffell. Seventeen minutes later, the jury returned and convicted Bamber by a 10 to two majority.</p> <p>In 2018 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/21/scientists-report-casts-doubt-on-jeremy-bamber-trial-evidence\">the Guardian revealed</a> that a week before the trial, the head of biology at Huntingdon Forensic Science Laboratories wrote to Essex police saying the blood on the silencer \u201ccould have come from Sheila Caffell or Robert Boutflour\u201d, another relative. That letter was not disclosed to the defence.</p> <p>The Guardian also revealed that a peer-reviewed report compiled by Philip Boyce, a ballistics expert at Forensic Equity Ltd, was sent to the CPS in 2019 about the possibility that there had been more than one silencer. The CPS has dismissed his findings, without employing its own expert to study his report.</p> <p>At the trial the prosecution argued that Caffell could not have killed herself because she had been shot in the neck twice. Earlier this year, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/11/jeremy-bamber-lawyers-say-new-evidence-undermines-conviction\">Guardian revealed</a> statements made by senior police officers who attended the crime scene had been uncovered, stating that they had only seen one bullethole in Caffell\u2019s neck. Again, these statements were not disclosed to the defence. Bamber believes other vital records have not been disclosed.</p> <p>Mark Newby a solicitor advocate at Quality Solicitors Jordans, which represents Bamber, said: \u201cSince proceedings were issued it came to our attention that the author of the book the ITV drama was based upon appears to have received material directly from the police.</p> <p>\u201cIt cannot be right that an author has been given material that Mr Bamber\u2019s defence team have not seen, particularly in light of the persistent refusal by the CPS to disclose specific material we have been asking for. It raises the question of whether a work of fiction is more important than justice.\u201d</p> <p>Bamber, speaking from Wakefield prison, told the Guardian: \u201cIt is disgusting that a third party was provided with documents and sensitive photographs when Essex police and the CPS have been unwilling to hand over material to our own forensic experts to prove that two silencers were recovered from the scene.</p> <p>\u201cDespite court orders being in place for them to make full disclosure to us, which they deliberately chose to ignore, when Carol Ann Lee requested material she was given it without a second thought. Where is my justice?\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Essex police said: \u201cWe are aware of the claim made by Jeremy Bamber and can confirm that this matter forms part of an ongoing judicial review. As this matter is therefore the subject of a forthcoming legal hearing it would not be appropriate for us to comment further.\u201d</p> <p>On 1 May, the case was adjourned to 29 May.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 1 May 2020. The name of the ITV docu-drama was White House Farm, not White House Farm Murders. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Shortly before the London lockdown, at an eerily quiet branch of Waterstones, I managed to get my hands on <em>T</em><em>he Decameron</em>, by Boccaccio,<em> </em>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/08/notebook-essays-on-aunts-daniel-defoe-plague-fiona-maccarthy\">Daniel Defoe\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/08/notebook-essays-on-aunts-daniel-defoe-plague-fiona-maccarthy\">A Journal of the Plague Year</a>. </em>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jan/05/albert-camus-the-plague-fascist-death-ed-vulliamy\">Camus\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jan/05/albert-camus-the-plague-fascist-death-ed-vulliamy\">The Plague</a> </em>had gone the way of dried pasta and toilet roll; there was just a desolate gap on the shelves where the copies had once been.</p> <p>The primary lesson of plague literature, from Thucydides onwards, is how predictably humans respond to such crises. Over millennia, there has been a consistent pattern to behaviour during epidemics: the hoarding, the panicking, the fear, the blaming, the superstition, the selfishness, the surprising heroism, the fixation with the numbers of the reported dead, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/14/welcome-to-the-quarantine-era-where-bored-lonely-and-trapped-indoors-may-be-the-new-normal\">boredom during quarantine</a>.</p> <p>Defoe would have recognised the impulses behind the strange tableaux of life interrupted in central London: piles of ice melting outside abruptly closed bars; a truck unloading gym equipment at an oligarch\u2019s house in Mayfair; jittery shoppers with overloaded trolleys. \u201cMany families,\u201d he writes, \u201cforeseeing the approach of the distemper laid up stores of provisions sufficient for their whole families, and shut themselves up, and that so entirely, that they were neither seen or heard of till the infection was quite ceased.\u201d</p> <p>The sudden, powerful need to know what\u2019s coming is predictable, too. We turn to historical witnesses who can explain what it\u2019s like. Defoe\u2019s motive for writing <em>A Journal of the Plague Year</em> was an outbreak of bubonic plague in Marseille in 1720. Anticipating its spread, readers wanted to know what it had been like in 1665. Defoe, responding to demand, provided them with an instant book, fashioned out of statistics, reminiscences, gossip, anecdote and blood-curdling dramatic detail. \u201cPassing through Token-House Yard in Lothbury, of a sudden a casement violently opened just over my head, and a woman gave three frightful screeches, and then cried, \u201cO death, death, death!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cedf7c1086eddf6178b5daa9275ea03a55f1b5d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cedf7c1086eddf6178b5daa9275ea03a55f1b5d0/0_0_5315_3740/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Great Plague In LondonGreat Plague in London, 1665.

Novelistic moments such as these would make the book compelling at any time, but right now it has a painful relevance. Defoe is particularly strong on the unpreparedness and prevarication that made the impact of the plague more severe. Or, as he puts it: \u201cI often reflected upon the unprovided condition that the whole body of the people were in at the first coming of this calamity upon them; and how it was for want of timely entering into measures and managements, as well public as private, that all the confusions that followed were brought upon us, and that such a prodigious number of people sunk in that disaster which, if proper steps had been taken, might, Providence concurring, have been avoided.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"68b9b628eb922c50500fd111cbc16d7c543e21dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68b9b628eb922c50500fd111cbc16d7c543e21dd/0_0_4134_4121/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Bracingly vivid ...

There\u2019s something amazingly bracing about his vividness and curiosity \u2013 the bills of mortality, quoted in full; minor characters such as the <a href=\"https://iiif.wellcomecollection.org/image/L0002773.jpg/full/880%2C/0/default.jpg\">religious </a><a href=\"https://iiif.wellcomecollection.org/image/L0002773.jpg/full/880%2C/0/default.jpg\">fanatic Solomon Eagle</a> who walks around naked with a pan of burning charcoal on his head; and the imprudent John Cock, a barber who is so relieved by the apparent retreat of the epidemic that he returns to normal life too soon and pays the penalty. Moral: don\u2019t be a John Cock.</p> <p>So much of the behaviour of our 17th-century forebears is uncomfortably familiar. The citizens of east London watch complacently as the plague tears through the West End, and assume they will be fine. They\u2019re proved terrifyingly wrong. Defoe adds in a chilling parenthesis: \u201cFor indeed it came upon them like an armed man when it did come.\u201d</p> <p>Even before germ theory, Defoe\u2019s common sense and perceptiveness led him to conclusions of which our chief medical officer would approve. He gives a prescient warning about the danger of asymptomatic carriers: \u201cThe plague is not to be avoided by those that converse promiscuously in a town infected, and people have it when they know it not, and that they likewise give it to others when they know not that they have it themselves.\u201d</p> <p>If human behaviour remains dismayingly constant, one thing that has changed for the better is science and our understanding of it. Seven hundred years on, there\u2019s something deeply poignant about Boccaccio\u2019s pre-scientific description of the spread of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/18/mass-grave-shows-how-black-death-devastated-the-countryside\">Black Death</a> in his native Florence. \u201cWhat was particularly virulent about this plague was that it would leap from the sick to the healthy whenever they were together, much as fire catches hold of dry or oily material that\u2019s brought close to it. And that was not all. Not only did speaking with the sick and spending time with them infect the healthy or kill them off, but touching the clothes of the sick or handling anything they had touched seemed to pass on the infection.\u201d You feel like the audience in a pantomime, wanting to shout across the centuries and tell him who the villain is and how he operates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3ae05447b0a6414cae1bdc03dfb524ec2d8243f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ae05447b0a6414cae1bdc03dfb524ec2d8243f3/0_0_4500_3119/1000..jpg\" alt=\"The Plague of Athens was an epidemic that devastated the city-state of Athens in ancient Greece during the second year of the Peloponnesian War (430 BC) when an Athenian victory still seemed within reach. It is believed to have entered Athens through Piraeus, the city\u2019s port and sole source of food and supplies. Thucydides states that people ceased fearing the law since they felt they were already living under a death sentence. Likewise, people started spending money indiscriminately.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"693\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There was particularly high mortality among doctors,\u2019 Thucydides tells of the plague in fifth-century Athens.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Science History Images/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not everyone responds to plague by immersing themselves in data about epidemics. The escapist response to disaster is another predictable move and <em>The Decameron </em>epitomises it. After his short but terrifying description of the Florentine plague, Boccaccio sends his troupe of young characters into quarantine, where they spend the remainder of the book, swapping funny, ribald stories: the plague doesn\u2019t feature again. It\u2019s a welcome relief to lose yourself in a world of cuckolds and randy nuns. And once more, <em>plus \u00e7a change.</em> The gilded Florentine youths are doing the 14th-century equivalent of binge-watching <em>Sex Education</em> on Netflix.</p> <p>Thomas Mann and Camus are less interested in plague itself than in using it to make existential points. The plague in <em>Death in Venice </em>is an avatar of death in general, the terrible mystery, the pale horse; it is something that strips away vanity and reveals unpalatable truths. In Mann\u2019s novella, it is the catalyst for Von Aschenbach\u2019s humiliating descent into clownish self-destruction. At the same time, the pages dealing with the cholera epidemic are vigorous and apposite. The hotels in Venice empty swiftly, despite official protestations that there is nothing to worry about. It\u2019s a young English travel agent who finally cuts through the official flannel. The doubts he raises about administrative competence and probity are ones that in due course we\u2019ll all be obliged to consider. \u201c\u2018That is,\u2019 he continued in an undertone and with some feeling, \u2018the official explanation, which the authorities here have seen fit to stick to.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2b07afc189084e27db046c360430d27f9f70445\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2b07afc189084e27db046c360430d27f9f70445/0_85_2992_1898/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Neil Bartlett\u2019s adaptation of Camus\u2019 The Plague at the Arcola theatre, London, in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"634\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Existential epidemic ... a scene from Neil Bartlett\u2019s adaptation of Camus\u2019 The Plague at the Arcola theatre, London, in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Hobson/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Camus is the real odd one out. <em>The Plague </em>is often read as an allegory of the French experience under occupation, but right now there seems nothing allegorical about it: the hero, Dr Rieux, seems like a naturalistic depiction of a frontline care-worker forced into impossible decisions over who gets a ventilator. At other historical moments, the constant reflection on the meaning of the plague could seem heavy-handed \u2013 Gallic, not in a good way \u2013 but in 2020 it\u2019s like reading <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/feb/14/the-crucible-the-perfect-play-for-our-post-truth-times\">The Crucible</a> </em>while your elderly parent is on trial for witchcraft. For long stretches, you forget any notion of allegory and simply wonder how Camus could have got it so right: from the panic buying of peppermints that people think will be a prophylactic, to the high mortality rate in the municipal jail, to the exhausted healthcare workers, and the terrible monotony of quarantine, something with which we are only just beginning to get acquainted.</p> <p>And then, of course, the plague ends. That\u2019s the actual good news that these books bring. The epidemic always passes. The majority of people survive. Thucydides himself had it and recovered. \u201cI shall simply tell it as it happened,\u201d he promises of the plague that ravaged fifth-century Athens, \u201cand describe the features of the disease which will give anyone who studies them some prior knowledge to enable recognition should it ever strike again.\u201d</p> <p><em>Should it ever strike again </em>is the phrase that awakens our sense of hubris. For all the talk of an unprecedented crisis, we are living through something with many precedents. \u201cThere was particularly high mortality among doctors because of their particular exposure,\u201d Thucydides wrote 2,500 years ago in a sentence that could appear in tomorrow\u2019s paper. We have assumed that deadly epidemics belonged to a phase of history that was behind us, as quaint and irrelevant as candlelight and milking your own cows.</p> <p>When the number of fatalities finally peaks and dwindles, Defoe\u2019s citizens pull up their windows and shout to each other to share the news. Camus\u2019s Oran is liberated; its citizens struggle to make sense of what has happened to them. Back in fifth-century Athens, the Peloponnesian war continues. Whether society changes for the better or worse, or simply stays the same, is what we will find out.</p>",

Nearly 30% of the 179 active circuit court judges are now Trump appointees.</p> <p>Owing to this extraordinary push, the ideological makeup of the courts has slowly tipped in a conservative direction. Since 2017, three of the courts have \u201cflipped\u201d from a majority of judges appointed by a Democratic president to a Republican-appointment majority.</p> <p>The US court of appeals for the eleventh circuit, which oversees cases in Florida, Alabama and Georgia, has gone from an 8-3 majority of judges appointed by Democrats, with one vacancy, to a 7-5 majority of judges appointed by Republicans.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Trump has \u201cflipped\u201d the second and third Circuits, and he has effectively flipped a fourth court, the ninth circuit, some analysts think.</p> <p>\u201cI still like to think there\u2019s a bottom line for even conservative Trump appointees on the court of appeals, that there\u2019s a line there that they won\u2019t cross over, that we\u2019ll remain a country of laws and not men,\u201d said Sheldon Goldman, a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who focuses on the federal bench. \u201cBut who knows?\u201d</p> <p>Together the ninth, eleventh and fifth circuit courts decide thousands of cases a year with broad repercussions for daily life in America. Here\u2019s a look at how the three courts are changing under Trump.</p> <h2>Eleventh circuit</h2> <p><strong>Florida, Georgia, Alabama</strong></p> <p><strong>Key issue: Who gets to vote</strong></p> <p>Floridians struck a historic blow in favor of universal suffrage in the 2018 midterm elections, passing a constitutional amendment that restored the right to vote to felons who had completed their sentences. With a 30-point margin of victory, the will of the voters was unambiguous.</p> <p>But the reality of voting in Florida, a key presidential swing state, has been slow to change. Last May, the Republican-controlled legislature passed a law curtailing the right of felons to vote who owe money from legal penalties, significantly rolling back the 2018 referendum result.</p> <p>In reply, would-be voters sued the Republican governor, and now voting rights in Florida are in a very different place from where they seemed to be in November 2018. Instead of being before the electorate, the issue is before the federal courts, which means it is in the hands of judges appointed by Trump.</p> <p>In a ruling expected in the coming months, Trump\u2019s judges could strip the right to vote from the 1.5 million people who had it restored in the 2018 referendum, in defiance of the popular will, potentially swaying the results of the November 2020 election, in a swing state that Trump needs to hold in order to return to the White House.</p> <p>\u201cWe had fears about what these jurists would do when they got on the bench, just from their records,\u201d said Marge Baker, executive vice-president of People for the American Way (PFAW), which maintains a tracking tool of Trump\u2019s judges called <a href=\"https://www.pfaw.org/blog-posts/trump-judge-claims-states-cant-be-sued-for-voting-rights-act-violations-confirmed-judges-confirmed-fears/\">Confirmed Judges, Confirmed Fears</a>. \u201cThis administration more than any has really been putting movement ideologues on the bench who have an agenda. And once we got far enough into the administration, we realized that the judges about whom we had fears were issuing decisions that were highly problematic.\u201d</p> <p>Rulings by circuit courts, which average about 13 active judges each, are typically issued by randomly selected three-judge panels, meaning that the overall makeup of the court does not directly come into play in every ruling.</p> <p>Over time, however, the composite ideological orientation of a court comes through. And Trump\u2019s judges on the eleventh circuit have shown what critics see as a hostility to a central issue for the state of Florida and the country: voting rights.</p> <p>The legal team representing voters in the Florida felony disenfranchisement case claims in part that the state law was passed with racial and discriminatory intent in violation of the constitution.</p> <p>\u201cThis issue of felony disenfranchisement is a really important issue in the United States,\u201d said Sean Morales-Doyle, a Brennan Center lawyer who is litigating the case.</p> <p>\u201cFlorida\u2019s voters came forward and really made clear that they rejected this, that this wasn\u2019t a policy that voters on any part of the political spectrum believe in. And then we promptly saw the Florida legislature attempt to undo that.\u201d</p> <h2>Ninth circuit</h2> <p><strong>California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, Hawaii, Montana, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona</strong></p> <p><strong>Key issue: Immigration</strong></p> <p>Since Trump became president, the US court of appeals for the ninth circuit has gone from an 18-7 majority of active judges appointed by Democrats, with four vacancies, to a much narrower 16-13 majority of judges appointed by Democrats. But the court\u2019s senior judges, who carry about half the caseload of active judges, also issue rulings \u2013 and at the senior level, Republican appointees now outnumber Democratic appointees 10-3.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s already flipped in some ways,\u201d said Carl Tobias, a professor at Richmond School of Law specializing in federal judicial selection, of the ninth circuit.</p> <p>Whatever the balance on the bench, activists express concern about decisions coming down from the court, historically one of the most progressive in the country. </p> <p>Trump judges on the ninth circuit have been especially abrasive in immigration cases, denying spousal visas in violation of long precedent and dismissing asylum claims, including in a case where the plaintiff had evidence of murders of multiple family members in his home country.</p> <p>In one dissent, a Trump-appointed judge supported a Trump proclamation banning entry to any would-be immigrant who could not prove either possession of health insurance or an ability to pay for healthcare.</p> <p>The judge ruled that the government would \u201csuffer immediate, irreparable harm\u201d unless the health insurance screen was allowed to stand, <a href=\"https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/19-36020/19-36020-2019-12-20.pdf?ts=1576882834\">quoting</a> Trump on the \u201cfinancial and public health burdens that the uninsured can impose\u201d.</p> <p>Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/01/28/judicial-appointments-in-trumps-first-three-years-myths-and-realities/\">analyzes</a> the shifting makeup of federal courts under Trump, said the ninth circuit had undergone \u201ca big change\u201d and noted that the outsized caseload of the circuit, the biggest in the country covering 60 million people, often required visiting judges to fill in.</p> <h2>Fifth circuit</h2> <p><strong>Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi</strong></p> <p><strong>Key issue: healthcare</strong></p> <p>Since Trump became president, the US court of appeals for the fifth circuit has gone from a 9-5 majority of active judges appointed by Republicans, with three vacancies, to an 11-5 majority of judges appointed by Republicans, with one vacancy.</p> <p>Trump judges on the circuit have boosted key administration projects, especially on immigration, greenlighting $3.6bn in spending on the border wall and taking a chilly view of asylum claims. They have issued rulings inimical to employment equality and fair housing claims, and protected law enforcement from liability for excessive use of force. In a case with ominous resonance under the coronavirus pandemic, the court has defended objections on religious grounds to immunizations.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s worth pointing out that four of the courts, the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth, had Republican-appointed majorities when Trump took office,\u201d said Wheeler. \u201cSo he has perhaps strengthened the Republican-appointee majority on those courts by putting younger and perhaps ideologically more committed judges in the place of older Republicans.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Sweden has persisted with the strategy of coronavirus mitigation that the UK government eventually abandoned in March. The policy is widely supported by the public, even though the Swedish Covid-19 <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality\">mortality rate</a> is among the 10 highest in the world, at <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/\">240 per million</a> population and steadily rising, and many of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/anger-in-sweden-as-elderly-pay-price-for-coronavirus-strategy\">nursing homes</a> in Stockholm are now affected.</p> <p>The typical explanation for this continued public support is that Swedes are trusting and unflappable. The country\u2019s chief epidemiologist, <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-swedish-epidemiologist-anders-tegnell-the-target-of-praise-criticism/\">Anders Tegnell</a>, the public face of the Swedish response to the pandemic, is after all a dry scientist-turned-bureaucrat, not some populist politician trying to whip up nationalist go-it-alone emotion.</p> <p>But beneath the surface, Sweden is anything but calm. The public debate is inflamed with a sense of wounded national pride. As a believer in the kind of liberal nationalism that encourages self-critical national attachment, this pains me. But as a scholar of nationalism, I recognise the pattern. This is what Isaiah Berlin called the nationalism of \u201cthe bent twig\u201d, which lashes out against anyone who steps on it.</p> <p>It began with a self-conceit that seemed more comical than harmful. Why, one columnist <a href=\"https://www.expressen.se/kultur/jonas-gardell/lat-sverige-vara-sverige-i-kampen-mot-corona/\">asked</a>, could we not just \u201clet Sweden be Sweden\u201d? Others <a href=\"https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/kolumnister/a/vQ79VX/svenskarna-ar-minst-lika-coola-som-britterna\">suggested </a>we brand ourselves \u201csmart Sweden\u201d or \u201ckind Sweden\u201d, the country immune to the hysteria of southern Europe.</p> <p>The next step was the ridicule and delegitimisation of opponents. A group of 22 scientists <a href=\"https://www.dn.se/debatt/folkhalsomyndigheten-har-misslyckats-nu-maste-politikerna-gripa-in\">wrote a joint opinion column </a>arguing for a drastic change of strategy. But within a few hours no one was paying attention to the substance of their arguments. Instead the debate came to revolve entirely around the fact that they used Covid-19 <a href=\"https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide\">death numbers that made Sweden look worse</a> than the more cautious estimates of the public health agency. This was certainly clumsy, but did not undermine their main conclusion. Nor does the fact that Sweden does indeed now have close to six times <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/photos-norway-sweden-different-coronavirus-responses-fatality-rates-2020-4?r=US&amp;IR=T\">more deaths</a> per capita than neighbouring Norway or Finland.</p> <p>Then came contempt for emotions, mixed with misogyny. Lena Einhorn, one of the 22 critics, was interviewed via videolink from her home. She broached research reports and numbers, but influential columnists focused on <a href=\"https://www.expressen.se/kultur/victor-malm/coronahaveristerna-ar-en-skam-for-sverige/\">making fun of her hair</a> or curtains. Her \u201chysterical\u201d voice when describing the suffering of Covid-19 patients was also widely mocked. The detached response to her by chief epidemiologist Tegnell was hailed as evidence of his credibility. It is true that he speaks clinically about death in terms of statistical curves. But it is equally true that he did not offer much rebuttal of the research reports she quoted.</p> <p>From this trope of Sweden being alone in doing it right, we seem now to have shifted to denying that Sweden is doing anything exceptional at all. An opinion piece by a political scientist <a href=\"https://www.dn.se/debatt/sa-sprids-falska-nyheter-om-den-svenska-coronastrategin/\">suggested</a> that the Guardian had \u201cblacklisted\u201d Sweden, and that its reporting had described Sweden as \u201cfree from restrictions\u201d. \u201cWho would have thought Trump\u2019s fake news would one day turn out to be somewhat real?\u201d he concluded.</p> <p>But these claims are themselves untrue. The Guardian among others rightly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/dont-judge-swedens-light-touch-on-covid-19-yet-says-minister\">reported</a> the comparatively mild restrictions in Sweden. Nor was it \u201cfake news\u201d when Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported that Swedish doctors could soon be denying respirators to patients over the age of 80, and even those as young as 60 with underlying health conditions. In fact,<a href=\"https://www.dn.se/sthlm/lakare-vi-tvingas-till-harda-prioriteringar/?fbclid=IwAR3YgZoFabFIYGuaYwYG89JiCWy356YVIkOV1lXgmylXpxs7QN-4VBKzhrs\"> this</a> is now taking place.</p> <p>The public veneration for Tegnell has gone far beyond trust. He has become an icon, <a href=\"https://www.svt.se/kultur/tegnell-hajpen-ett-tecken-pa-svenskars-tillit-till-makten?fbclid=IwAR026SjdEvfAD_m9jPi0n_hMSIzg0xTrD53WWqUC3WUlD2dG0iDxfzbPdMc%20;%20https://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/anders-tegnell-har-blivit-en-james-bond-i-svensk-byrakratversion/\">his face appearing on tattoos and baby garments</a>. Writers otherwise known to cringe at any sign of nationalism describe him as the <a href=\"https://www.expressen.se/kronikorer/jens-liljestrand/anders-tegnell-ar-den-svenska-nationalsjalen-forkroppsligad/\">incarnation of Sweden\u2019s soul</a>. He should be <a href=\"https://www.expressen.se/tv/nyheter/coronaviruset/tidigare-folkhalsoministern-anders-tegnell-borde-bli-arets-svensk/\">named Swede of the year</a>, says the former minister of public health. Serious newspapers run hagiographic stories on Tegnell and the general director of the public health agency, Johan Carlson. Pictures of their head offices flooded with flowers sent by private citizens are included.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/22/this-is-europe-sign-up-guardian-email-updates\">This is Europe: stay close with the Guardian\u2019s email updates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some failures of the Swedish model have been acknowledged. But they are often <a href=\"https://bppblog.com/2020/04/23/the-swedish-exception/?fbclid=IwAR3K5DXn7fD94-P0laRivYpJOUWf6bXn4bWR86W2LJqyK3Q08Jhx574-WoE\">linked to the lack of \u201ccompliance\u201d</a> of immigrants. Former chief epidemiologist Johan Giesecke <a href=\"https://unherd.com/thepost/coming-up-epidemiologist-prof-johan-giesecke-shares-lessons-from-sweden/\">explains</a> the failure to protect the elderly in nursing homes with reference to \u201casylum seekers\u201d and \u201crefugees\u201d on the staff, who \u201cmay not always be understanding the information\u201d. This has met with silence, if not approval. It may already have been picked up by the Sweden Democrats, Sweden\u2019s anti-immigration party, who now <a href=\"https://www.aftonbladet.se/debatt/a/Op997O/aldreomsorgen-ar-inte-en-integrationsatgard\">claim </a>the health of elderly people has been put at risk for the sake of integrating uneducated immigrants.</p> <p>Defenders of the government\u2019s strategy keep repeating that it is too early to evaluate it. But carrying that argument through to its logical conclusion suggests that veneration should also be postponed until the pandemic has passed. Any successful strategy should be transparent and welcome public scrutiny. My fear is that in our vehement defence of the Swedish approach, we have released forces we cannot control. As is clear for anyone who has followed Brexit, a nationalism unable to handle criticism can easily tear a society apart.</p> <ul> <li><p>Gina Gustavsson is an associate professor at the Department of Government, Uppsala University, and an associate member of Nuffield College, University of Oxford.

Boredom! Screens! It\u2019s the full spectrum of coronavirus feelings | First Dog on the Moon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Quarantines have meant different things for people. It exhausts some as they spin from remote work to remote school and checking in on friends and family, all amid the miasma of disease and dashed dreams. Others are exhausted by vast stretches of open time, cornered at home with nothing to do but binge movies, scroll through Instagram and agonize. Some may crave solitude; others are suffocating in it.</p> <p>All this monotony is, for many of us, incredibly boring. But please don\u2019t wish away your boredom. Despite its bad reputation, boredom is secretly powerful and quite wonderful.</p> <p>I began studying boredom six years ago during a creative dry spell. I was struggling to come up with ideas for my podcast. The feeling was more disturbing than my usual writer\u2019s block, like sand filling my cranium.</p> <p>I responded with a pavlovian impulse to be productive. Every empty crack in my day was filled. Instead of staring at people\u2019s feet on the subway, I attacked my inbox. Why wait idly for the barista to make my coffee when I could check the headlines or how many steps I walked?</p> <p>It was then that I realized this mental state itself was worthy of consideration,<strong> </strong>maybe even worth indulging. I decided to find what happens in our brains when we allow ourselves to get bored \u2013 when we just<em> stand </em>by the swings as our child goes back and forth for the hundredth time and <em>don\u2019t text someone</em>. I wasn\u2019t sure I could even manage to do that any more. But perhaps I should. Because what if the human condition of boredom actually has a purpose?</p> <p>The cognitive psychologists and neuroscientists I interviewed explained that when boredom strikes and our minds begin to wander, we ignite the <a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-neuro-071013-014030\">default mode </a>of our brain: a neural network where our most original ideas and problem solving happens. This neural network, discovered by neuroscientist <a href=\"https://sites.wustl.edu/nillabs/people/marcus-e-raichle/\">Marcus Raichle</a> 20 years ago, kicks into gear when we aren\u2019t focused on a specific external task.</p> <p>Think of it this way. When you first get into the shower, you\u2019re attentive, concentrating on getting the water temperature right and locating the shampoo. But once you\u2019ve scrubbed your scalp, the water lulls you \u2026 and your mind drifts away \u2026 into the default mode. Though you\u2019re ostensibly doing nothing, or seemingly mesmerized by a patch of grout, <em>this</em> is when the mental magic begins.</p> <p>Perhaps it\u2019s on a small scale, like if you come up with an amazing way to sneak vegetables into your child\u2019s meal. Or, it can be on a much grander scale, like if a biochemical researcher has a eureka moment in the shower and figures out a new way to save lives.</p> <p>Beyond presenting us with ideas, the brain\u2019s default mode also facilitates a process called <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4711352/\">autobiographical planning</a><strong>, </strong>a neuroscientific term which refers to what our mind does when we daydream. Lying there, staring at the ceiling, we think back to high and low moments in our lives, take note of the good and bad times, and tell ourselves the story of \u2026 ourselves. Our personal narrative. We imagine the future, visualize ourselves in new situations, set personal goals and then concoct strategies. Think of the default mode as a time machine in your brain with which you visit your past and future personhood.</p> <p>After learning all this I began the <a href=\"https://www.wnyc.org/series/bored-and-brilliant\">Bored and Brilliant Project</a> (and later wrote a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bored-Brilliant-Spacing-Productive-Creative/dp/1250124956/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=\">book</a> by the same name) for my podcast Note to Self<em>,</em> drawing 20,000 listeners all eager to see how being bored more often might change them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"77e58b9550d1f3bffde555434e9ca9c4f38ba514\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77e58b9550d1f3bffde555434e9ca9c4f38ba514/355_0_2109_2637/800.jpg\" alt=\"Deleting a social media app can feel like \u2018waking from a mental hibernation\u2019.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deleting a social media app can feel like \u2018waking from a mental hibernation\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Ansell/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My favorite moment was when we all, simultaneously, deleted the app that we felt compelled to incessantly tap to relieve boredom instead of simply experiencing it. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m waking up from a mental hibernation,\u201d one listener wrote. \u201cI pick up my guitar more, sleep better.\u201d Other stories included people who helped their child make friends at school, solved office conflicts, found ways to finish a doctoral thesis, and started a new business.</p> <p>One listener, Liam, removed every single social media app from his phone. He described the feeling of seeing no new notifications on his phone as a \u201ckind of embarrassing emotional experience\u201d, but, he said, \u201cI like not giving my phone the power to decide that for me. So thank you.\u201d</p> <p>Boredom isn\u2019t all great. It has been found to trigger some unpleasant thought patterns, including rumination \u2013 going round and round in your head about mistakes or fears. Too much mind wandering can lead to anxiety or depression. There\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about how boredom works. </p> <p>Still, I\u2019ve been hearing from a small but vocal contingent of people who are teaching themselves to embrace boredom while in quarantine. </p> <p>\u201cMy boredom has led me to searching for my passion,\u201d wrote one. \u201cI am reading more and am more focused than ever.\u201d</p> <p>Startlingly, some young people have told me that they\u2019ve never experienced boredom. One even said, \u201c I don\u2019t think I could get bored because I can\u2019t be alone with myself.\u201d</p> <p>Quarantine grants us a gift: time. Time to clear out the dishwasher slowly. Time to go for a (socially distanced) walk without listening to anything. Time to lie on the ground while your child builds a fort around your head. We need to use this time wisely, embrace this uncontrollable ambiguity and reset our relationship to longer-term thinking.</p> <p>In meditation, we\u2019re told to let our thoughts waft away. But when with boredom, I suggest you watch those thoughts carefully. See where they lead you.</p> <p>Don\u2019t worry if you feel like you\u2019re not doing it right. It can take time to pass through the uncomfortable side of boredom and into the empowering part. You might find embracing boredom jumpstarts your creativity too or, at the very least, relieves you from feeling any guilt about spending an afternoon on the couch doing nothing. You\u2019re actually being productive \u2013 and just might change your life.</p>",
  "<p>It was time to dispose of the aubergine. The one I acquired 39 days ago. Once firm, noble-seeming and purple, it now sat there looking forlorn \u2013 mottled in places, with a slightly jammy undercarriage. I picked it up several times on Tuesday and edged it closer to the bin, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to make the final push: chucking food would be an admission of defeat.</p> <p>This decaying, bulbous lump was symbolic, I realised. It meant I couldn\u2019t just meal-plan and to-do list my way out of this mess. Covid-19 would still be here, causing havoc, at every level of my existence, whether I made soup out of mulchy salad leaves or raita from on-the-turn yoghurt. And, by God, I\u2019ve been good and compliant and jolly resourceful for six entire weeks by now, eating rotting things that I didn\u2019t quite fancy. Remember <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/03/how-am-i-coping-the-only-constant-has-been-working-out-what-to-eat\">the banana bread stage</a>? These were the same bananas still, just all hot and mushy now, but with one in the eye for the grim reaper.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been saintly about food waste, avoided supermarkets, protected the NHS and not frittered money on Deliveroo, but, to be quite honest, it no longer really feels like winning. The aubergine needed to go. \u201cThis must be how Elizabeth I felt while signing Mary\u2019s death warrant,\u201d I thought, quite reasonably. This is the sort of inner monologue you have in total self-isolation, cooking for yourself and seeing no one, for more than a month. By June, this column will be mainly hieroglyphics and links to YouTube clips of static.</p> <p>Over the past six weeks, as restaurants shut up shop, the industry has grappled to work out if we\u2019ll ever need chefs again. And at first I thought perhaps not - let\u2019s all just stew our own aubergines. But now I know we\u2019ll always need these people with their pans, stamina and imagination. All as barmy as a box of frogs, by the way (and I know <em>a lot</em> of chefs), but that\u2019s all part of their charm. And eating my own home cooking, and only home cooking, has proved to me that life feels oddly flat when you remove other people\u2019s flights of fancy.</p> <p>I am well fed right now, and I am nourished. I am fortunate, too. But I also feel as if I\u2019ve gone by accident on a bad holiday, to a very remote, one-star TripAdvisor resort with only one restaurant, whose chef is diligent and well-meaning, but limited. Three weeks ago, I stopped bothering to shower for dinner because everything in every terrine \u2013 from the porridge to the pasta, and for breakfast, lunch and dinner \u2013 tasted oddly similar. Also, at 5pm daily, after the cha-cha lessons, they read out the latest death toll, but now I\u2019m just quibbling.</p> <p>And in that light, Deliveroo\u2019d vermicelli noodles and silver cartons packed full of battered stuff in bright neon, orange sauces begin to feel like a weird lifeline. I click on the web page, dawdling tantilisingly over the \u201copen now\u201d section. Dare I? Yes, I dare.</p> <p>Regardless where this virus leads us, there will in this weird new world definitely be a place for being cared for by others. And for that kind of Cantonese food that makes actual Cantonese people pinch the soft skin between their eyes in abject sadness, but that tastes fantastic as it\u2019s forked directly into one\u2019s gullet. We need it as much as \u201ccontrol\u201d and \u201cbeing good\u201d and dal-ing our own lentils and turning that aubergine into sodding ratatouille.</p> <p>In recent weeks, I\u2019ve craved burgers seasoned with, well, I don\u2019t quite know what. At some pub. Any pub. It\u2019s the chef\u2019s recipe, and he\u2019s not telling. Served in a fresh brioche bun. You know, one of those glossy buns that are frankly shocking for your weight, so I don\u2019t buy them to have at home. But, gosh, do I miss someone else, an anonymous source, supplying me with them. I miss someone else lacing my food with far too much oil, or butter, or salt, because I\u2019m just a stranger and they care little for my heart valves, but they want me to love their food and come back. I yearn for those anonymous figures, stood behind the stove, stirring good, freshly made pasta into silky sauces. I miss all the heat and light and extra happiness that you can\u2019t really pull off at home: the sear of a very hot grill, a judicious handful of MSG, a deep tandoori lustre and laksa noodles that have been cooked in several complex stages.</p> <p>But, until then, I\u2019ve got a bag of king edward potatoes with eyes and sprouts that need eating. I\u2019m too guilty to bin them, too. There is eating to live, and living to eat, and I\u2019ve learned which one I prefer.</p>",
  "<p>I test sex toys for a living, so I thought I knew a lot about the female orgasm. Then I discovered \u201csexual transmutation\u201d \u2013 the idea that you can harness your sexual energy to achieve goals.</p> <p>The practice is nothing new \u2013 it exists in Tantric and Taoist traditions. But I set about developing my own \u201cmasturbation for manifestation\u201d method. My system combines the law of attraction (the belief that we attract into our lives whatever we focus on) with visualisation techniques and my own orgasmic energy. I set an intention, then stimulate myself sexually while I use my imagination to eroticise my aim.</p> <p>For instance, to manifest a new home, I might imagine myself inside it: my bare feet against the floor, naked on the new sofa and something erotic happening there. When I reach orgasm, the energy is released into the universe, where it begins to attract the ideal place.</p> <p>Some desires are easier to eroticise than others. Getting aroused while I thought about loan repayments was a challenge, but last summer I managed to become debt-free. I find masturbation with intention also takes a lot longer than when I was focused just on pleasure. This is a practice I reserve only for masturbation: when I\u2019m having sex with someone, I\u2019m focused on sharing an intimate moment.</p> <p>Thanks to my technique, I have manifested some incredible things, such as professional opportunities, holidays, even love. I hardly recognise my life now. It doesn\u2019t always work, but at least I enjoy the process.</p> <p>\u2022 Each week, a reader tells us about their sex life. Want to share yours?

  "<p>Thousands of Americans plan to take part in a rent strike on Friday, calling for state leaders to cancel rent during the coronavirus crisis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/fbi-head-christopher-wray-opposed-encryption-under-trump-once-defended-whatsapp\">Documents reveal FBI head defended encryption for WhatsApp before becoming fierce critic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Activists in New York, Pennsylvania and California<a href=\"https://actionnetwork.org/forms/mayday-cantpay\"> are encouraging</a> tenants to withhold rent, whether they are able to pay or not, to draw attention to the plight of those unable to pay.</p> <p>The protest is expected to represent the largest coordinated rent strike in America in decades, and comes as the labor department announced another<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/us-unemployment-americans-jobless-coronavirus-pandemic\"> 3.8 million people lost their jobs</a> last week, with pressure growing on state leaders nationwide to increase their efforts on housing.</p> <p>More than 30 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits in the past six weeks, as the coronavirus has caused widespread business closures. </p> <p> The New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is among those voicing support for the strikes, which are being coordinated by an array of housing groups.</p> <p>\u201cPeople aren\u2019t striking because they don\u2019t feel like paying rent, they\u2019re striking because they can\u2019t,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said.</p> <p>In New York, <a href=\"https://actionnetwork.org/forms/mayday-cantpay\">more than 12,000</a> people have pledged to not pay their rent, and progressive state lawmakers have <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/janetwburns/2020/04/26/ny-lawmaker-proposes-tenant-rent-freeze-and-cash-mortgage-relief-for-landlords/#1604b0c67fd4\">proposed legislation</a> that would suspend or cancel rent payments for tenants who lost income due to the coronavirus. In March, New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, <a href=\"https://ny.curbed.com/2020/3/26/21192343/coronavirus-new-york-eviction-moratorium-covid-19\">suspended evictions</a> for 90 days, in a move that prevents landlords from ousting tenants who cannot pay their rent.</p> <p>But critics say that merely postpones the problem.</p> <p>\u201cWe need a suspension of rent and automatic forgiveness of any rent, mortgage or utility payment owed or accumulated during the length of this crisis,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.housingjusticeforall.org/covid19\">said Housing Justice for All</a>, which campaigns to increase tenants\u2019 rights and to end homelessness in New York.</p> <p>Like Cuomo, Governor Gavin Newsom of California has barred evictions due to coronavirus hardship \u2013 tenants must provide proof their income has been affected by the pandemic \u2013 but stopped short of waiving individuals\u2019 rent payments. About 8,000 members of the Los Angeles Tenants Union are <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/survival-tenants-landlords-brace-largest-rent-strike-decades-n1195751\">expected to withhold rent</a> as of 1 May, while a similar movement is taking place in Philadelphia.</p> <p>If the estimates of New York City organizers prove accurate, the rent strike would be the largest there since the 1930s, when tenants in Harlem and the Lower East Side demanded lower rent. In Harlem, the protesters <a href=\"http://www.tenant.net/Community/history/hist03f.html\">were predominantly African Americans</a>, who protested against being charged higher rent than white tenants.</p>",
  "<p>Ten years ago I did three months of self-isolation. I wasn\u2019t well, had had a terrible breakdown and could barely leave the house. Company was overwhelming, work impossible. So I sat and figured out a new way to live.</p> <p>The episode was excruciating, but much good came out of it. Crisis is opportunity. We learn from mistakes. Failure enables us to succeed better. All the old cliches, of course, but the reason cliches are cliches is that they are often true.</p> <p>I was able to gradually restore bits of my life and see if they were good for me. Work, yes. Overtime, no. Family, yes. Friendships, yes. Worrying, no. <a href=\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/fomo\">FOMO</a>, no. Duty, no. Shoulds, no.</p> <p>This is the opportunity we have now, individually and collectively. It\u2019s a huge chance to do some things better, to start anew.

Learn to cherish what you do have, not whine about what you don\u2019t, because, I promise, there are tens of millions out there who would kill for a tenth of what you have. Be grateful.

With the lockdown, instead of the walk I resurrected my exercise bicycle in the kitchen. Doing a total of eight miles after meals has dramatically reduced the post-prandial glucose spikes, measured by my 14-day flash glucose monitor.

  "<p>Joshua Haynes was raised to work hard and take care of his family without asking for outside help. But when the utility bills arrived last month, he knew there would be trouble.</p> <p>Haynes, 34, a construction worker from Newbern, Tennessee, was left without income after the governor issued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/us-coronavirus-outbreak-tennessee-kentucky\">a stay-at-home order in early April</a>. As a cash-in-hand builder, he is not eligible to claim unemployment insurance, and the stimulus cheque still had not arrived.</p> <p>\u201cI always pay my bills on time, but without work, I just didn\u2019t have the money to cover everything, so I asked for an extension. They said no,\u201d Haynes said.</p> <p>Haynes, who lives with his wife and three children, managed to get the money just six days after the bill was due, but the city refused to accept the payment unless he also paid a $70 reconnection charge. He didn\u2019t have it, and the charge didn\u2019t make sense as they had not been disconnected.

  "<p>A viral disease that causes honey bees to suffer severe trembling, flightlessness and death within a week is spreading exponentially in Britain.</p> <p>Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) was only recorded in Lincolnshire in 2007. A decade later, it was found in 39 of 47 English counties and six of eight Welsh counties, according to data collected from visits to more than 24,000 beekeepers.</p> <p>As well as struggling to fly, the afflicted bees develop shiny, hairless abdomens. Piles of dead individuals are found outside hives with whole colonies frequently wiped out by the disease.</p> <p>A team of scientists led by <a href=\"https://www.ncl.ac.uk/iafri/staff/profile/gilesbudge.html#background\">Prof</a><a href=\"https://www.ncl.ac.uk/iafri/staff/profile/gilesbudge.html#background\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.ncl.ac.uk/iafri/staff/profile/gilesbudge.html#background\">Giles Budge</a><a href=\"https://www.ncl.ac.uk/iafri/staff/profile/gilesbudge.html#background\"> of Newcastle University</a> identified clusterings of the disease, with cases concentrated among apiaries run by professional beekeepers rather than amateur keepers.</p> <p>In the study, published in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/ncomms/\">Nature Communications</a>, scientists used data from 130,000 honey bee imports from 25 countries to show for the first time that the disease was nearly twice as likely in apiaries owned by beekeepers who imported honey bees. Professional beekeepers bring in honey bee queens to replenish their hives every few years.</p> <p>Another way in which commercial beekeeping could be contributing to the spread of the disease is because they tend to manage large colonies, and the virus appears to be rapidly transmitted in densely populated hives.</p> <p>But Budge said it was not clear that the disease was imported via queens and it was \u201cunfair\u201d to claim the disease was caused by industrial beekeeping.</p> <p>\u201cThe bee farmers of this country tend to be quite small-scale. A standard bee farmer might have 100 to 200 colonies. In the States, they have up to 10,000. Even in Germany there will be huge-scale beekeeping going on,\u201d he said.</p> <p>According to Budge, professional beekeepers may run into problems in Britain because they are very successful at bringing bees through the winter and building up colonies in spring to take advantage of early flowers such as oilseed rape. If the weather then turns wet, these large colonies are then confined to a hive. \u201cYou can\u2019t do social distancing in a hive as easily but you can manage it by increasing the space in there,\u201d said Budge.</p> <p>The viral disease has been around for centuries \u2013 its symptoms were first described by Aristotle \u2013 but researchers are keen to discover if a new, more virulent strain is behind its global surge. In the United States, CBPV prevalence was 0.7% in 2010 but reached 16% in 2014. Prevalence doubled in Italy from 5% to 10% between 2009 and 2010. In China, prevalence has grown from 9% to 38%.</p> <p>Infected adult bees carry the virus for up to six days without showing symptoms, and may spread it to other colonies at sites where different bees forage for food.</p> <p>But honey bees typically do not forage further than 10km in Britain, and the study found significant clusters of the disease up to 40km apart. A quarter of beekeepers have multiple sites, so could be assisting the spread of the disease.</p> <p>Although the disease appears to \u201cburn out\u201d in Britain and does not recur in hotspots between seasons, it returns to the country in other locations over time. The disease has also been found in wild bumblebee and ant populations, but the direction of transmission is not clear.</p> <p>Rob Nickless, chairman of the <a href=\"https://beefarmers.co.uk/\">Bee Farmers\u2019 Association</a>, which supported the study, said: \u201cThis is the sort of research that brings practical benefits to the industry \u2013 helping bee farmers at grassroots level to improve honey bee health and increase UK honey production.\u201d</p> <p>Researchers will continue to examine the genetics of the disease to determine if there is a new strain and seek to discover whether imported queens are bringing the disease into Britain, or whether those queens are simply more susceptible to the virus that is already here.</p>",

Think of it as a classier boutique release, deserving of a higher shelf placement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/30/the-half-of-it-review-netfix\">The Half of It review \u2013 charming Netflix teen comedy takes on Cyrano</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We first meet Jahkor (Ashton Sanders) as he\u2019s breaking into the house of a couple before shooting them both dead in front of their young daughter. The film them splits into three timelines, each delicately balanced by Cole, as we see Jahkor as a child (played with heartbreaking conviction by Jalyn Hall) abused by his addict father JD (Jeffrey Wright), Jahkor getting involved in criminal actvities in the months before the killing and Jahkor in prison. It\u2019s a reflective movie, with a reflective title, as he revisits the ups and downs that led him to a life sentence and while the film offers explanations, it never offers excuses, with a considerable grey area at its centre.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC9Kk8Np9-Y\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BC9Kk8Np9-Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>What\u2019s initially most striking about All Day and a Night (other than the intensity of Sanders\u2019 stare) is just how much it feels like an actual movie. Discarding the flat TV palette so many other Netflix-funded film-makers seem happy to stick with, writer-director Cole clearly has something a lot grander in his sights and he squeezes every last drop from his limited budget, working as if the intention was for a far bigger screen. It\u2019s stylish work but Cole avoids gimmicky flourishes, which would have been an easy fallback given the material, and instead maintains an evocative aesthetic while providing a number of standout visual sequences \u2013 one particular one-shot party that takes us from inside a venue and out through the streets is more cinematic than most Netflix originals combined. Some of his turf war plotting is a bit muddled but it\u2019s his character study of a boy who\u2019s not quite sure how to be a man that proves more interesting.</p> <p>Via an often insightful and often hackneyed voiceover, Jahkor talks about the prison he was born into, how as a young black man living in a working-class neighbourhood he has always been surrounded by four walls, they just became more noticeable when he was sent away. He speaks of the little cuts, the micro-aggressions he has to encounter from the the teacher who has already given up on him to the racist white customer at the shoe store where he works who\u2019s already judged him to the cops who are eager to imprison him, the cuts that slowly make him bleed. His toxic father is both aggressor and victim himself, an addict with mental health issues without the help he so sorely needs. Cole makes some moves toward blaming a bigger system, one without the resources or empathy to help people at the bottom, but ensures that his characters are never just victims, they\u2019re active in their choices even if their choices are limited. It\u2019s a messy world and Cole refuses to make it more palatable for us, inspiring tough questions while withholding easy answers.</p> <p>There\u2019s a small but ferocious turn from Wright but it\u2019s Sanders who dominates, building both on his standout performance from Moonlight and his film-elevating work since in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/25/native-son-review-ashton-sanders-adaptation\">Native Son</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/14/captive-state-review-ambitious-sci-fi-thriller-offers-up-uneven-intrigue\">Captive State</a>. While I look forward to seeing him expand his repertoire with something a bit more left-field in the future, he\u2019s on fine form again here, rising to the challenge of his biggest lead to date, drawing us into Jahkor\u2019s plight even when his actions are hard to defend. He\u2019s a difficult character, the result of a difficult father, and while their scenes together are limited, Cole refrains from obvious soapy conflict, opting instead, finally, for something far more believable and far more poignant. Jahkor is being told not to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps, including by his father himself, but not being given the tools or room to do so. It\u2019s a sad but not entirely hopeless tale with an ending that offers room for interpretation, based on the viewer\u2019s optimism or pessimism over what could come next.</p> <p>All Day and a Night is a weightier alternative to the average Netflix original and while imperfectly realised and scrappily plotted at times, it\u2019s another promising sign that, away from the easy-to-digest content, there\u2019s room on the platform for much much more.</p> <ul> <li><p>All Day and a Night is now available on Netflix</p></li> </ul>",

If urgent decisions are not made now, the justice system will be at breaking point by the autumn.</p> <p>\u201cMany large courtrooms, university lecture halls, schools and leisure centres are currently sitting empty.

  "<p>Anybody accumulating evidence for the existence of old souls could do worse than check out the Hampshire-born trumpeter-composer Laura Jurd\u2019s contribution to jazz in the eight years since her remarkable debut album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/dec/06/laura-jurd-landing-ground-review\">Landing Ground</a>. Jurd seems unconcerned by transient fashions or enrolment in any kind of scene, and pursues a private muse that draws on jazz, folk traditions from Europe and the Middle East, and the harmonic language of Stravinsky \u2013 yet her work is always spiritedly accessible, and often suggests wordless songs. To the Earth is Jurd\u2019s third release with her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/nov/04/laura-jurd-dinosaur-review\">Dinosaur quartet</a>, a closely bonded ensemble embodying the jazz axiom that composition and improvisation are an inseparable two-way stretch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e48bcb3d14671473dd7189b32ba24fdd94608981\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e48bcb3d14671473dd7189b32ba24fdd94608981/0_0_2000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"To the Earth album cover\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>These seven tracks run to barely more than than 40 minutes but Dinosaur make them all count. The title track hooks attention with its opening treble-chord piano splash from Elliot Galvin, signalling Conor Chaplin\u2019s repeating bass vamp, the arrival of a vivacious trumpet melody of folk-dance triplet twists and coolly jazzy resolutions, and Corrie Dick\u2019s implacable percussion pulse.</p> <p>The dirge-like, ghostly Slow Loris finds Jurd in a voicelike early-jazz mood of muted trumpet sounds and growls (sometimes deepening the brass harmonies on tenor horn), while Galvin solos in unhurried Monkish dissonances.

  "<p>The Apex was nearly finished. A brand new cruise ship for the Celebrity Cruises line, it was a towering, 117,000-ton vessel with luxuries like a \u201cresort deck\u201d featuring martini-glass-shaped jacuzzis and a movable platform cantilevered off the side \u2013 known as \u201cthe Magic Carpet\u201d \u2013 to be used as an outdoor restaurant. As the builders put the finishing touches to it, the company held parties for crew and contractors, even as the rest of the world was shutting down to prevent the spread of coronavirus.</p> \n<p>Alexandra Nedeltcheva was one of the waiters. Though she avoided the parties, she served the contractors and crew at one of the ship\u2019s restaurants. She says she contracted Covid-19 before the Apex even left port.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really scary, you don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to last,\u201d says a coughing Nedeltcheva. She says she had trouble getting anyone to respond to her calls for medicine and help. \u201cWhen I called medical and said, \u2018can you get me some medicine, my head is going to explode\u2019, they said, \u2018there are people sicker than you, stay where you are\u2019.\u201d</p> \n<p>She is one of more than 100 Celebrity Cruises crew members who have joined a class-action suit filed against the company on 14 April, alleging it failed to take timely action to protect workers, despite having weeks of notice that coronavirus was spreading worldwide.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b05d4419605b955b08d2503b661e2e36ed0a6bff\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b05d4419605b955b08d2503b661e2e36ed0a6bff/0_0_4291_2864/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crew on the balcony of the Celebrity Apex cruise ship, Saint-Nazaire, France, 1 April 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Apex crew claim the company failed to protect workers.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sebastien Salom-Gomis/SIPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The ship is not an exception. Across the world, a Guardian investigation has uncovered at least 50 ships facing outbreaks of Covid-19 among the crew.</p> \n<p>Nedeltcheva, who managed to catch a charter flight to her home city in Bulgaria, may have been one of the lucky ones.</p> \n<p>Upwards of 100,000 other crew members \u2013 including hundreds of her colleagues aboard the Apex \u2013 remain trapped on their ships.</p> \n<p>Most have no communication with the outside world, and the ones who do are often scared of losing any prospect of future work by complaining. In the course of the Guardian\u2019s investigation, however, a portrait has begun to emerge of what is effectively a nation of floating castaways, marooned on boats from the Galapagos Islands to the port of Dubai.</p> \n<p>The first cruise ship to face Covid-19 cases, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/06/inside-the-cruise-ship-that-became-a-coronavirus-breeding-ground-diamond-princess\">Diamond Princess</a>, was quarantined at dock in Japan for two weeks starting on 3 February. But cruises kept departing until mid-March. Although most passengers have since been repatriated, Covid-19 outbreaks continue to spread among the crew stuck on the ships. Last week employees aboard the Queen Victoria, which had just pulled into Southampton, were told they would have to quarantine in their cabins for 14 days because Covid-19 cases had been confirmed aboard, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/leaked-audio-cunard-cruises-queen-victoria-has-cases-of-covid-19-2020-4?r=US&amp;IR=T\">according to a recording</a> of the captain\u2019s announcement obtained by Business Insider.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13bc6b2b35e6d8a9a38c5029b961e5b1e6e5295a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13bc6b2b35e6d8a9a38c5029b961e5b1e6e5295a/0_0_3902_2600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers in protective gear prepare to check passengers after they disembarked the Diamond Princess cruise ship at the Daikoku Pier Cruise Terminal in Yokohama, Japan, 21 February 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Diamond Princess was quarantined for two weeks in Japan.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jiji Press/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the US the situation was so grim aboard the Oasis of the Seas, from which rescue crews have repeatedly evacuated sick workers to hospitals in Florida, that the captain made an announcement over the loudspeaker asking crew members not to video their co-workers being taken off the ship in ambulances, according to an account from an employee <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article241922051.html\">given to the Miami Herald</a>.</p> \n<p>Another member of the class-action suit against Celebrity Cruises, which is owned by Royal Caribbean, is Julia Melim, a US resident who hosted the Celebrity Infinity\u2019s shopping and port-tourism show on the shipboard TV channel. Melim was one of only seven crew members allowed to leave the ship in Miami last week. The rest remain aboard. She says there was so much sickness that the ship\u2019s medical personnel cleared out the whole third floor to isolate and treat people who had symptoms.</p> \n<p>The cruise industry says cruise lines were just as blindsided by the pandemic as the rest of the world and that those on ships haven\u2019t suffered higher infection rates than those on land.</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for Celebrity Cruises said: \u201cWe have no higher priority than keeping our guests and crew safe, healthy, cared for and well-informed. We have at all times worked in close coordination with government and health authorities and are grateful for their guidance. We are working with all appropriate authorities to ensure the safe return home of all our crew members.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Cruise Line Industry Association says it is still assembling information on how many of its ships have been affected, but says it so far knows of 899 confirmed cases of Covid-19 on board 15 ocean-going cruise ships.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis accounts for 0.06% of confirmed cases globally,\u201d said the association in a statement. \u201cIt is hard to tell how many of those confirmed cases are crew members, as we are still in the process of collecting that information as well.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2da79a3fa901f293204107e769208dd183f9a10f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2da79a3fa901f293204107e769208dd183f9a10f/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cruise ship Ruby Princess departs from Port Kembla, Australia, on 23 April 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cruise ship Ruby Princess had 900 cases of Covid-19 and is blamed for spreading the virus around Australia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saeed Khan/AFP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Those numbers appear to grossly underestimate the problem, given that the Diamond Princess alone had more than 600 cases.

Because of the pandemic, however, the US and other ports are refusing to take all but the most dire cases.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey are basically getting no healthcare,\u201d says Michael Winkleman, the attorney in Miami who filed the class-action suit. \u201cThey are locked in their rooms and told they can call an advice line for help. But when they call, no one comes.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cruise lines have little recourse in seeking government help for urgent healthcare. While many of the major cruise companies, including Carnival and Royal Caribbean, are headquartered in the US, the companies are registered in low-tax countries. Carnival is technically a Panamanian company and Royal Caribbean is registered in Liberia, meaning they pay almost no US taxes.</p> \n<p>Likewise their ships are typically flagged in countries such as the Bahamas or Bermuda, which allows them to avoid strict safety standards, labour laws and environmental restrictions they might otherwise face in the US.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"aae21371-2edd-4aee-8af6-9a80a79d6943\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>A ship flying a flag of convenience means the owner has registered the vessel in a country other than their own.

Workers have complained that food seemed to be running out, and that they were forced to pay for internet time.</p> \n<p>Many crew have had their pay cut off entirely. Workers on board several ships run by the Geneva-based MSC cruise line, according to letters from MSC seen by the Guardian, are no longer being paid after their contracts ran out or were terminated early by the company because of the global pandemic. </p> \n<p>A spokesperson for MSC cruises said: \u201cMSC Cruises has taken the difficult decision to temporarily suspend its cruise ship operations. As this health crisis has caused all our ships globally to stop operating, we have temporarily agreed to relieve the majority of our crew from their duties and are working to identify and pay for flight tickets for each and every one to safely return home for the duration of the temporary suspension of ships\u2019 operations. We are offering all those who remain on board full board and lodging free of charge, assigning each of them a guest cabin for individual use.\u201d</p> \n<p>A former crew member for another major cruise liner, Krista Thomas, who lives in Vancouver, has been running a private Facebook group to update crew members at sea about how to get home.</p> \n<p>She says many crew are scared to speak out. They depend on the cruise industry for livelihoods, and cruise ship pay \u2013 while low compared to average wages in many developed countries \u2013 is often many times higher than what they can earn at home.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re probably not just taking care of a wife and kids; they\u2019re taking care of parents and in-laws,\u201d says Thomas. \u201cThey are living contract to contract to get by \u2026 They don\u2019t want to tear the industry down.

  "<p>Three generations of working mothers. My grandmother, at home with 10 children between the wars, took in sailors\u2019 washing to make ends meet. She had no schooling after the age of 12 and remained a \u201chousewife\u201d, dependent on my grandfather. In the 1950s my mother, a school-leaver at 14, worked part-time while her three kids were small, then full-time in the accounts office of a big department store. In the 1970s my older sister left home, trained as a teacher, married and also had three children. She retired a headteacher on a professional pension; her life was poles apart from my grandmother\u2019s.</p> <p>Yet all three women led \u201cdouble lives\u201d, fitting their paid jobs around housework and childcare. Their labour was also typically female. Laundry work such as charing or cleaning has been a perennial standby for the poorest women in society. Girls like my mother, with some schooling, turned to the factory, shop or office work; those with more qualifications have been ushered into the \u201ccaring\u201d professions such as nursing and, above all, teaching. \u201cThere are no typical lives,\u201d Helen McCarthy writes in her impressive and nuanced study. Each is unique. But the best history writing, like hers, shows how representative the individual life is.</p> <p><em>Double Lives</em> begins in the mid-19th century, but its vantage point is very much that of the present. Three quarters of British mothers now work, an astonishing shift from the Victorian era. And a mother\u2019s desire to earn independently is largely viewed as legitimate. Yet despite this cultural sea change, and despite inroads made into all the professions, the majority of working mothers are in low-paid, insecure jobs with rigid hours and no childcare. Just as their Victorian predecessors finished garments or glued matchboxes, today\u2019s home-workers make baby slipper-socks or attach crystals to greetings cards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58f24e9d1d7b7f52cb6d95a2f470780061c61811\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58f24e9d1d7b7f52cb6d95a2f470780061c61811/0_766_4938_2961/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The component assembly room at Ferranti\u2019s radio works, Moston, Merseyside, in 1935.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The component assembly room at Ferranti\u2019s radio works, Moston, Merseyside, in 1935.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daily Herald Archive/SSPL/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Well into the 20th century the majority of British men and women, including most feminists and women\u2019s organisations, argued that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/26/is-motherhood-the-unfinished-work-of-feminism\">motherhood</a> was a woman\u2019s prime vocation. Women entering the professions felt they must choose between mothering or a career. The \u201cgood\u201d mother only worked because she had to. A deserted wife, a widow or a lone parent was to be pitied. The \u201cbad\u201d mother worked because she wanted to. How much, McCarthy asks, has changed? The ideal of the male breadwinner, always able to earn enough to keep wife and children at home, no longer holds sway. But today\u2019s employers and policymakers still mostly assume \u201cthe worker\u201d to be male. Social welfare provision all too often merges the needs of the mother and child and sees the wife as dependent on her husband. The home is still imagined to be the mother\u2019s \u2013 not the father\u2019s \u2013 place.</p> <p>McCarthy\u2019s is an economic and social history, but she also wants to give \u201cshade and texture\u201d to what has been thought and said about working mothers. In this she succeeds magnificently. She is as much at home with popular novels and journalism as she is with cabinet memos, parliamentary commissions, employment law, or sociological reports. She never treats her sources as gospel, neatly characterising much early social investigation into the lives of the poor as \u201ca genre-crossing blend of statistics and sentiment, empiricism and emotionalism\u201d. And always the voices of working mothers are raised above the cacophony of official and unofficial commentary.</p> <p>The worst-off women were never simply victims. While the majority certainly worked from economic necessity, they could also enjoy their jobs. Home-workers were often proud of their skills. Industrial employees relished the camaraderie and the taste of freedom. One young mother in a Midlands jam factory met with disapproval from a female inspector when she confessed she would hate to stay \u201cat \u2019ome all dye to mind the blessed byby \u2013 it \u2019ud give me the bloomin\u2019 \u2019ump!\u201d She spoke for many in the decades to come.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Part-timers often found themselves without any chance of promotion, refused sick pay and holiday entitlement</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><em>Double Lives</em> sometimes reads haltingly as it hedges its arguments. The early 20th century saw droves of women take up clerical work, but new marriage bars limited their prospects. Wartime administrations called up mothers for their reserve army of labour, focusing on their needs and even providing workplace nurseries, but only for the duration. Part-time work expanded enormously after the second world war, thanks to a consumer boom, but employers used its temporary nature to justify unequal pay. Treated as a stopgap between matrimony and childbearing, or as extra housekeeping for the older mother returning to work, part-timers often found themselves without any chance of promotion, refused sick pay and holiday entitlement. Two steps forward, one step back. In the long run, though, the figure of the working mother became more ordinary and acceptable.</p> <p>McCarthy writes with calm authority. But she is not neutral. \u201cThe narrowly conformist\u201d 50s come in for particular criticism. Yet in that decade far more mothers, like my own, found satisfaction in working outside the home. <em>Double Lives</em> is dubious about theories of \u201cmaternal deprivation\u201d, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/10/psychotherapy-childhood-mental-health\">John Bowlby</a>\u2019s or Donald Winnicott\u2019s, which have so often been used as a stick to beat working mothers. A history of childhood experience would obviously be a different book; McCarthy\u2019s few retrospective testimonies leave the issue wide open.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6cfc23abb0ed7605d72ba8e5d39e3ffcffa0374\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6cfc23abb0ed7605d72ba8e5d39e3ffcffa0374/0_25_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Since 1945, governments have invested in nursery schools.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Since 1945, governments have invested in nursery schools.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Frost/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the postwar decades a second income became a source of pride and prosperity. Higher aspirations were inextricably linked to consumerism, on spending for the home and on leisure. Today\u2019s two income families have inherited the assumption that personal fulfilment is linked to buying and having more. Families have shrunk in size since reliable contraception and abortion have gradually become available \u2013 a seismic shift for many women, who are no longer subject to endless childbearing. <em>Double Lives</em> says little about new forms of peer pressure to have children, or the burgeoning commodification of motherhood (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/01/mothercare-to-close-50-stores-as-part-of-rescue-package\">Mothercare</a>, founded in 1972 and now defunct, would be a case in point).</p> <p>McCarthy\u2019s final chapters chronicle recent advances \u2013 in employment law, pay battles, and anti-discrimination policies. More working mothers than ever find self-esteem and economic independence in many more walks of life. They speak out more in public and they are listened to. But still they are guilt-ridden and often exhausted. While the media has amplified and distorted debates about \u201cthe selfish mother\u201d, the women \u201cwho work too hard\u201d, and those who want to \u201chave it all\u201d, the competitive individualism of many professional workplaces is hardly feminist, let alone enjoyable. The language of professionalisation gives women status but reproduces male corporate models of marketisation (McCarthy, a historian at Cambridge, briefly refers to her \u201cline-manager\u201d). So-called empowerment comes at the expense of an underclass of other women doing the housework, the majority of them black or from ethnic minorities. Men haven\u2019t shifted that much into domesticity or childcare. And in some communities husbands still prefer their wives not to work.</p> <p>At different times both Labour and Conservative administrations after 1945 invested in maternity services and nursery education. McCarthy argues that despite ideological differences, governments have gone on viewing the interests of women and families as one and the same thing. In the 70s feminists critiqued the family for shoring up the housewife\u2019s role and for enshrining children as possessions. Fewer of us now live in conventional families, but the rhetoric of the family, preferably \u201chard-working\u201d, is still constantly deployed. As the cornerstone of conservative visions of social life, the family remains idealised. During the current pandemic, as so often in past crises, women, and especially mothers, are being asked to shore up this fantasy while working twice as hard.<br><br><em>\u2022 Alison Light\u2019s A Radical Romance is published by Fig Tree.

You get a good screen, OK battery life, a camera that\u2019s hard to beat at this price, wireless charging, water resistance and a build quality second to none.</p> <p>But the icing on the cake is the A13 processor and industry-leading software support that should see the iPhone SE receive at least five years of software updates. That means you can buy the iPhone SE and still be safely using it five years later. Not even Google\u2019s Pixel 3a will manage that.</p> <p>It\u2019s not perfect, of course: the battery life could be longer, the screen could be bigger or the body smaller, there\u2019s no headphone socket, no Face ID and it takes ages to charge. Lovers of tiny 4in iPhones such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/13/apple-iphone-se-review-too-small-for-most-people\">previous iPhone SE</a> will be disappointed by the size.

  "<p>Errol Graham, a 57-year-old grandfather <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/28/disabled-man-starved-to-death-after-dwp-stopped-his-benefits\">who died of starvation when his benefits were cut off</a>, had become so mentally ill that his family believe he pulled out two of his own teeth with pliers, they have revealed.</p> <p>Fresh details of Graham\u2019s decline, and the traumatic impact on his relatives of his lonely death and subsequent inquest, are revealed in a witness statement filed as part of the latest phase of a legal action taken by the family against the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).</p> <p>Graham weighed just 28kg when he was found dead at home by bailiffs sent to evict him in June 2018, eight months after all his benefits were stopped because of his failure to attend a fitness for work assessment. His flat had no gas, electricity supply or working phone, just one lightbulb, a broken fridge and no food.</p> <p>Graham\u2019s family is seeking a judicial review of the DWP\u2019s safeguarding process system, saying he would be alive today if officials had checked properly on his health and wellbeing before automatically revoking his benefits for failing to attend a medical assessment, leaving him without income.</p> <p>Despite knowing Graham\u2019s long medical history of mental illness and failing to speak to him, the DWP told his inquest it had followed its safeguarding process correctly and that while it had unfortunate consequences, revoking Graham\u2019s benefits was \u201cthe right decision \u2026 for us to have made\u201d.</p> <p>The family argues that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/01/dwp-criticised-for-incredible-secrecy-over-deaths-of-benefit-claimants\"> the secretive benefit safeguarding system</a> has long been unfit for purpose, and failed to protect claimants like Graham slipping through the safety net. They say the government has refused to acknowledge its failures or the scale of the problem, and has ignored calls for a open and accountable overhaul of the system.</p> <p>\u201cWe now feel like Errol\u2019s life never mattered to the DWP and that really hurts,\u201d the statement by his daughter-in-law Alison Turner says. \u201cErrol would want to make a better [social security] system for the millions who rely on it.\u201d</p> <p>The latest legal move is likely to amplify calls by campaigners and MPs for an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/27/errol-graham-man-starved-death-benefits-cut-letter-welfare-officials#img-3\">independent inquiry</a> into potentially hundreds of benefit-related deaths in recent years where vulnerable people took their own lives or became fatally ill as they struggled to cope when benefits were withdrawn.</p> <p>Harrowing details of the last days of Graham\u2019s life are included in the statement from Turner, who helped the authorities identify Graham\u2019s emaciated body shortly after it was discovered and subsequently cleared out his chaotic flat where he had locked himself away for his final days.</p> <p>One of the first discoveries Turner made was a cardboard box lid containing two of his back teeth, and a pair of pliers. \u201cI looked at it and I realised Errol must have pulled out his own teeth out. I couldn\u2019t imagine how much pain Errol must have been in to resort to ripping his molar teeth out. To me this was an indicator of how severe his mental heath issues were at the time.\u201d</p> <p>The extent of his destitution and decline was illustrated by a smashed-up TV in the hallway, Turner says. Two kitchen doors were hanging from their hinges and his blues and reggae CD collection was strewn over the living room floor. There were piles of letters, open and unopened, and his extensive collection of football trophies had disappeared.</p> <p>The contrast with her happy memories of him as a doting grandfather and keen footballer was devastating. Turner could hardly bear to go into his bedroom, where his body had been found on the floor. \u201cThere was still a strong smell of death in there, it turned your stomach.\u201d</p> <p>A moving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/27/errol-graham-man-starved-death-benefits-cut-letter-welfare-officials#img-3\">handwritten letter</a> by Graham to an unnamed DWP benefits examiner attempting to explain his daily mental despair and pleading with him to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/27/errol-graham-man-starved-death-benefits-cut-letter-welfare-officials\">\u201ctreat me fairly\u201d</a> when his benefits assessment was found. Terror of \u201cfit-for-work\u201d tests and the risk they carry that benefits will be removed is not uncommon among vulnerable claimants.</p> <p>Graham, who in better times would cycle 20 miles to see his grandchildren every other day, had a long history of serious mental health, including a spell in a psychiatric hospital, a suicide attempt, and depression. Declining health in his last two years led him to isolate from his family.</p> <p>Turner\u2019s statement says she went to Graham\u2019s inquest as his formal witness-under-oath with optimism, believing that it was \u201cabout fact finding and making changes for the better\u201d. She was struck by the aggression of the DWP legal team, which she concluded \u201cwas only concerned with getting the DWP off the hook\u201d.</p> <p>The family says DWP officials broke promises at Graham\u2019s inquest last year, saying the department has failed to publish a review of the benefit safeguarding system, or involve the families of victims in improving the way vulnerable claimants are treated. It has never apologised, or invited the family to discuss the matter, Turner says.</p> <p>The family\u2019s lawyer, Tessa Gregory, of law firm Leigh Day, said: \u201cOur client is being forced to pursue legal action because the DWP has so far refused to make any real changes to the safeguarding policies which allowed their loved one, Errol, to fall through the safety net with such devastating consequences.\u201d</p> <p>A National Audit Office report published in February found the DWP had investigated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/07/dwp-benefit-related-suicide-numbers-not-true-figure-says-watchdog-nao\">at least 69 suicides</a> linked to benefits problems since 2014 although the true figure is likely to be much higher. There no was evidence the DWP had learned from its reviews or improved its processes, it concluded.</p> <p>A DWP spokeswoman said: \u201cOur sympathies are with Mr Graham\u2019s family. It would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.\u201d</p> <p><em>In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\" title=\"\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\" title=\"\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

  "<p>This summer, new cohorts of young people will tumble out of their closed-down schools and colleges into a shut-down world of no work. Some half a million will be leaving university, as many more may be leaving school or ending training and further education to emerge into nothingness. If they have lost their entire summer term, they will have had precious little careers advice, most of which was an early victim of austerity cuts anyway. The wealth of research from previous recessions shows that a long spell of early unemployment risks people being scarred for life. </p> <p>Before the virus struck, they might have found jobs that didn\u2019t match their qualifications in pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes \u2013 almost all are now closed.

Many have physical disabilities, illnesses and mental health problems that have been ignored. Many are part of that long tail of lost youth from addicted or violent families; they are care leavers, people with no qualifications pulled into gangs and drugs, and failed by schools and underfunded social services that are unable to pick them up in time. As one employment expert said, \u201cThese were the ones we didn\u2019t fix when the sun shone.\u201d Instead of help, they were chased away from claiming benefits by Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s exceptionally punitive Jobcentre-sanctioning regimes demanding they sign in every day.</p> <p>This week the alarm was raised by the <a href=\"https://impetus.org.uk/youth-employment-group\">Youth Employment Group</a>, a new consortium including the Institute for Employment Studies (IES), the Prince\u2019s Trust and others determined to prevent another lost generation of long-term unemployed people. Tony Wilson, director of the IES, and a former senior DWP researcher, has been watching the weekly vanishing of vacancies in horror: \u201cThey are the lowest ever, three times worse than ever before and each week it gets worse.\u201d All sorts of jobs have gone, he says \u2013 in accountancy, finance and IT, along with the rest. In a recession, \u201cwhat kills is not people losing jobs, but the lack of anyone hiring,\u201d says Wilson.</p> <p>It will take a phenomenal government effort to fire up good work programmes. Already Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has talked this week of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/58846378-54e6-48d3-b7d4-b79211b4aece\">winding down the government\u2019s furlough</a><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/58846378-54e6-48d3-b7d4-b79211b4aece\"> scheme</a>. But what happens next to all the millions of employees who will be cast off? Young people are always at the back of the queue.</p> <p>Ministers have no memory: they deliberately forget anything some other government did. They prefer to reinvent wheels, marking their own thumbprint on schemes, regardless of voluminous evidence on what works. But this time, if they want to prevent unemployment armageddon, they should look back to what Labour did, both with 1997\u2019s new deal for young people and its post-2008 crash rescue programmes. What worked was job guarantees and high-quality training, experienced advisers and subsidies to employers to hire those who were unemployed.</p> <p>One of the most successful was the post-crash <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/223120/impacts_costs_benefits_fjf.pdf\">Future Jobs Fund</a>, a generous-spirited and popular plan. I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/feb/09/tory-cuts-recession-youth-unemployment\">followed its progress in detail</a>, interviewing its beneficiaries and employers who took people on. After six months\u2019 intensive help to find work with a personal adviser, people were offered expensive training in almost anything. If still out of work after nine months, any employer taking them on was given a subsidy of \u00a36,500.

  "<h2>Top story: Trump flouts intelligence with Wuhan claims</h2> \n<p>Good morning \u2013 Warren Murray with a round-up of the main headline news this Friday morning.</p> \n<p>Tensions have emerged in NHS England as it deals with how to redeploy BAME staff away from the virus frontline to safeguard their health. The death rate among British black Africans and British Pakistanis from coronavirus in English hospitals is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/british-bame-covid-19-death-rate-more-than-twice-that-of-whites\">more than 2.5 times that of the white population</a>, according to stark analysis by the Institute of Fiscal Studies. It also found that deaths of people from a black Caribbean background were 1.7 times higher than for white Britons.

The president was asked a few hours ago whether he had seen anything that gives you a \u201chigh degree of confidence\u201d to that effect, and replied: \u201cYes, I have.\u201d But the office of the director of national intelligence (DNI) had only just gotten through saying that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/donald-trump-coronavirus-chinese-lab-claim\">intelligence community does not believe coronavirus was manmade or genetically modified</a>, though it would examine any \u201cemerging information and intelligence\u201d about whether it came from animals or a laboratory accident.

  "<p>The UK\u2019s last judicial member of the European court of justice is suing the council of the European Union and the EU court over her removal from office because of Brexit.</p> <p>Eleanor Sharpston QC, advocate general to the court in Luxembourg, has lodged two claims challenging her replacement by a Greek lawyer before her term in office was scheduled to end next year.</p> <p>Her departure will not necessarily end direct British involvement with the ECJ. A claim has been submitted by a team of London-based lawyers arguing that even though the UK as a nation is leaving the EU, its <a href=\"https://www.dacbeachcroft.com/en/gb/news/2020/april/dac-beachcroft-files-landmark-case-with-general-court-of-the-eu-on-behalf-of-a-group-of-uk-nationals/\">citizens cannot be deprived of EU citizenship without their consent</a>.</p> <p>Sharpston, whose mandate was due to end in October 2021, has submitted two claims \u2013 against the council of the European Union, which represents the remaining 27 EU states, and against the ECJ itself.</p> <p>At the start of the year, Brussels issued a statement saying the mandates of all UK-related members of EU institutions would automatically end on 31 January. Sharpston was the exception to the rule and was told that she would stay on until a successor could take over.</p> <p>A Greek replacement for her has now been found. The number of advocates general, who advise the court\u2019s judges, is fixed at 11.</p> <p>A fellow of King\u2019s College, Cambridge and a former joint head of chambers in London, Sharpston has been at the ECJ since 2006. Earlier this year, contemplating the possibility of legal action, she told the Law Gazette: \u201cIt may be that the very last service I can render to my court is to see whether there is something I can do to push back against the member states intruding into the court\u2019s autonomy and independence.\u201d</p> <p>She is understood to be arguing that she should be be allowed to stay in office until her current six-year term expires and that her removal undermines the judicial independence of the court. Court rules, it is said, ensure that judges and advocate generals can only be removed when they reach the end of their mandate or reach the obligatory retirement age.</p> <p>The ECJ told the Guardian it could not confirm the identity of claimants in the two cases submitted. The court\u2019s last British judge, Christopher Vajda, lost his seat in February despite the UK remaining within the single market and customs union until the end of 2020. There are 27 judges sitting on the ECJ \u2013 one for every member state.</p> <p>A separate action legal action has been lodged at the ECJ this month by lawyers acting for Prof Joshua Silver, a physicist at Oxford University. The claim is being led by Prof Takis Tridimas of Matrix Chambers and lawyers from the London firm DAC Beachcroft.</p> <p>They argue that while the withdrawal agreement between the UK government and the EU has resulted in the UK as a nation leaving the EU, the fundamental status and rights of the British citizens of the European Union cannot be removed without their consent.</p> <p>Stephen Hocking, a partner at DAC Beachcroft, said: \u201cIn the withdrawal agreement, the EU council purported to remove fundamental individual rights from a group of citizens of the European Union, namely UK nationals, without any due process and without any reference to them. In doing so it acted unlawfully.</p> <p>\u201cEU citizenship is a citizenship like any other, and it confers individual rights on citizens that cannot be taken away by an agreement between governments.\u201d</p> <p>If he is successful, UK citizens would retain their rights as EU citizens, for example the right to live and work in EU member states.</p> <p>This week Guy Verhofstadt, the former Brexit coordinator for the European parliament, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guyverhofstadt/status/1254831786498064384?s=20\">tweeted </a>in support of the legal action: \u201cPeople received European citizenship with the treaty of Maastricht. Will be interesting to see, if a government decides to leave, its citizens automatically lose their European citizenship. They shouldn\u2019t do!\u201d </p> <p>The case, for which more than \u00a367,000 has already been raised, is being supported by crowdfunding through the website Crowdfunder.</p>",

His mutable features could switch from cherubic to lupine to gravely smouldering; his nerve endings felt exposed like frayed electrical wires.</p> <p>\u201cYou can feel all his emotions, all his vulnerability,\u201d says Cuar\u00f3n. \u201cHe fills the screen completely. After my wife met him, she said: \u2018Wow, he\u2019s so handsome, but I thought he would be tall.\u2019 He\u2019s like Al Pacino or Dustin Hoffman, the kind of actor whose aura and energy makes you think they\u2019re huge.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te-YQvAuDIw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Te-YQvAuDIw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In that wham-bam first half-decade of Bernal\u2019s film career, he gave four killer performances, any one of which would have been enough to build a reputation on: Amores Perros, Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n, Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s Bad Education, part of which he spent looking ravishing in drag, and The Motorcycle Diaries, in which he played a young Che Guevara. Now 41, Bernal has alternated between mainstream projects in the US \u2013 such as his five-year stint as an eccentric conductor in the delightful Amazon series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2014/mar/14/mozart-in-the-jungle-amazon-studios\">Mozart in the Jungle</a>, or his touching voice work as a balladeer trapped in the afterlife in the Disney/ Pixar gem <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/18/coco-review-pixar-land-of-the-dead-animation\">Coco</a> \u2013 and politically charged work in Latin America.</p> <p>When he calls me today, it is from Mexico City, one of two locations that is home to him (the other is Buenos Aires) and where he happened to be when the lockdown began. \u201cWhat\u2019s beautiful right now in Mexico,\u201d he says brightly, \u201cis that straight after the daily 7pm press conference, there are films on TV from the golden age of Mexican cinema, from the 1930s to the 1950s. It\u2019s been wonderful to watch them in this light. I see the hopes of the actors and film-makers from 70 or 80 years ago. I see their fears, their experiments, what they were trying to build and express. I find it all incredibly moving as a document of humanity.\u201d</p> <p>He thinks the current crisis is altering for ever the way we look at art. \u201cThere\u2019s something more straightforward now in how we see things \u2013 it\u2019s stronger, more elemental and pulsating. We\u2019re so emotionally charged. Artistic expression can affect us for the better, making us feel we\u2019re all in this questioning together.\u201d</p> <p>It is, he suggests, an ideal state in which to approach <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/01/ema-review\">Ema</a>, his third film with the Chilean director Pablo Larra\u00edn, following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/feb/07/no-film-review\">No</a>, about the 1988 plebiscite on Pinochet, and the fantasy-biopic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/07/neruda-review-pablo-larrain-gael-garcia-bernal\">Neruda</a>, in which he played a police inspector who doubts his own existence. Ema is the pair\u2019s most challenging collaboration, populated largely by destructive and dislikable characters; only gradually do their prickly exteriors peel away to reveal the wounded souls within. Bernal has the small but pivotal role of Gast\u00f3n, a choreographer married to the dancer Ema (<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6797988/\">Mariana Di Girolamo</a>). He is plainly callous \u2013 he taunts her over their recent failed adoption of a seven-year-old boy \u2013 but Bernal shows that Gast\u00f3n is suffering, too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d04556121977f4a6dabf48c32253f0913249ba5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d04556121977f4a6dabf48c32253f0913249ba5d/0_0_3098_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"As a young Che Guevara in The Motorcycle Diaries.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As a young Che Guevara in The Motorcycle Diaries.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paula Prandini/Imagenet</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere is something about the nature of his job that makes him feel very lonely. That was interesting to explore: he\u2019s the centre of gravity at this dance company, he puts everything together, and that leads to a lot of loneliness. It\u2019s like directing a film, which is a solitary pursuit even though it\u2019s collective.\u201d Bernal himself has directed two features \u2013 the 2007 drama <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJzIuap2Jo8\">D\u00e9ficit</a> and the as-yet-unreleased <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZShahG9SeI\">Chicuarotes</a>, about young Mexican hoodlums \u2013 as well as founding, with his childhood friend and Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n co-star Diego Luna, two production companies and a documentary film festival, Ambulante.</p> <p>So could Gast\u00f3n be a portrait of himself or Larra\u00edn? \u201cNo, not at all!\u201d he laughs. \u201cBut Pablo and I both understand him in his isolation and his stupefaction.\u201d Perhaps, then, he is comparable to Rodrigo, the conductor from Mozart in the Jungle, who is also a restless, demanding creative type? \u201cYes! Except that Rodrigo represents happiness and adventure, whereas Gast\u00f3n is the opposite. Rodrigo is Maradona. Gast\u00f3n is more like Mike Tyson.\u201d</p> <p>His role in Ema is notable for keeping his usual electrifying charm in check; if Gast\u00f3n is sexual, it is only in the most remote, reptilian way. Such unpalatable parts are rare on Bernal\u2019s CV. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/aug/31/5\">Fernando Meirelles\u2019s Blindness</a>, he played an unscrupulous bartender taking advantage of an epidemic that renders its sufferers sightless; in one scene, he performed a head-waggling, bad-taste version of I Just Called to Say I Love You. And in The King, his English-language debut from 2005, he was a psychopath calmly wreaking revenge on his long-lost father.</p> <p>\u201cGael had balls, to be blunt,\u201d says James Marsh, that picture\u2019s British director. \u201cWe went to quite a few up-and-coming young American actors, some of whom have big careers now, and none of them would go near that script. But Gael liked the idea of playing someone with this cold surface. I love way he moves in the film: he\u2019s always slinking around, more animal than human. The character has pure evil in him, but he played it in this blank way so that you didn\u2019t hate him.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s this incredible ease about Gael. I think he works far harder than one would imagine</p> <footer> <cite>Saffron Burrows</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nor, by the end of Larra\u00edn\u2019s picture, do we hate Gast\u00f3n. Whether we understand him is another matter, one that Bernal thinks may not be so important. \u201cThat\u2019s always the dilemma, right? Understanding. What the hell does it mean? There is that saying. I think it was Picasso, no? Someone said they didn\u2019t understand his work. So he asked them: \u2018You like eating eggs in the morning? You like your <em>huevos rotos</em>?\u2019 \u2018Yeah, I like them.\u2019 \u2018OK. But do you <em>understand</em> them?\u2019\u201d He chuckles at that.</p> <p>It is better, he says, for the audience to \u201cknow that they don\u2019t know\u201d the character\u2019s motivations. \u201cThat\u2019s the journey you embark on when you\u2019re building a character. Little by little, the pieces come together. OK, how would this character feel in the rain? What would he do outside? And you start to discover them. Playing Rodrigo in Mozart in the Jungle, there came a point where I could improvise a whole day of his life. I had that ownership of what he would do in any situation. That\u2019s the nirvana of acting: being able to go into places where you\u2019re not sure what the hell is going to happen.\u201d</p> <p>Saffron Burrows, one of Bernal\u2019s co-stars on Mozart in the Jungle, witnessed his process up close. \u201cThere\u2019s this incredible ease about Gael,\u201d she tells me. \u201cOne thing that was so enjoyable was his improvising, the little riffs he developed, the surprises. Every take was very different. I think he works far harder than one would imagine. Sometimes we\u2019d be doing the same scene for nine hours and I\u2019d see him mulling, working stuff out, honing it.\u201d She and Bernal go way back: they starred together as honeymooners in David Nicholls\u2019s short play <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/jun/22/theatre1\">Aftersun</a>, staged at the Old Vic in 2005.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3bf9d6316a22a74b53c1419ff7a4b837720723fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3bf9d6316a22a74b53c1419ff7a4b837720723fd/78_70_4271_2562/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernal with Saffron Burrows in 2005\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernal with Saffron Burrows in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Burrows even recalls frequenting the bar where he worked while he was a drama student in the late 90s. \u201cI used to go bobbing about with friends at this Cuban place in Islington where he was the barman. He\u2019s had that London training and he\u2019s always carried this internationalism about him. He\u2019s very welcoming. When we were making Mozart, he was always at the helm, always being the host.\u201d</p> <p>Although necessarily remote as Gast\u00f3n, he does get to reveal the character\u2019s churning inner turmoil during a frantic speech railing against his wife\u2019s lifestyle. \u201cThere are some opinions he has which I share,\u201d Bernal says. \u201cWhen he mocks the idea of going to Los Angeles and taking selfies, for instance. I would say there is no bigger treason for humankind. It\u2019s throwing your life away. I know it sounds horrible. But going to Los Angeles and taking selfies serves absolutely no transcendent purpose!\u201d</p> <p>Bernal resisted that city\u2019s siren call even before he and his former partner, the Argentine actor Dolores Fonzi, had two children: a son, L\u00e1zaro, now 11, and a daughter, Libertad, who is nine. He stayed put. \u201cNot because I didn\u2019t want to take selfies! There are just so many stories I wanted to tell. I wanted to change things with my own hands, not follow someone else\u2019s route.\u201d</p> <p>Marsh thinks that Bernal\u2019s integrity is vital to his acting. \u201cI have enormous respect for him and how he refused to take the easy path. He could easily have gone to Hollywood and become Antonio Banderas, but he didn\u2019t. He\u2019s stretched himself and matured into a great artist.\u201d Cuar\u00f3n, who went on to direct Bernal and Luna in the football saga Rudo y Cursi, agrees. \u201cGael and Diego are the most respected actors of their generation in Mexico. He\u2019s involved with social issues like immigration, and he\u2019s very outspoken politically. He is both criticised and celebrated, depending on who is in government here. And though he has lived everywhere, he has never left Mexico or stopped being involved in Mexican issues.\u201d</p> <p>Even noble, conscientious actors are only human. Has he ever taken any roles purely for the money? \u201cOh, there have been one or two,\u201d the actor says ruefully. I invite him to name and shame them, but he declines with a giggle: \u201cNoooo!\u201d So let\u2019s just say it is oddly comforting that even a performer as good as he is can still make films as poor as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jun/10/letters-to-juliet-review\">Letters to Juliet</a>, where he played Amanda Seyfried\u2019s insufferable boyfriend, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/feb/03/a-little-bit-of-heaven-review\">A Little Bit of Heaven</a>, in which he was an oncologist who falls for Kate Hudson as she dies photogenically and at great length.</p> <p>\u201cI did certain projects I wasn\u2019t too sure of,\u201d he admits. \u201cSometimes there would be a pleasant surprise, sometimes a very bad one where I\u2019d think: \u2018It\u2019s not worth it, man. What am I doing?\u2019 If this pandemic has made me learn one thing, it is that I have to work less. I need to nurture and have something to say.\u201d</p> <p>So he\u2019s not going to do another film he doesn\u2019t believe in? \u201cI think so, yeah. It\u2019s a commonplace thing to say. But now, thanks to this situation, it\u2019s even more acute, right? I\u2019m just going to do what I like. I\u2019m going to be stricter about that from now on.\u201d</p> <p><em>Ema is </em><em>available on free preview on 1 May, and then normally on Mubi from 2 May</em></p>",

There is another one raging right now. Since cholera first spread across the globe, two centuries ago, it has killed about 50 million people. In the time it takes you to read this article, another five people will have died from it. It is now mostly ignored in the west, but in other parts of the world, it has never gone away.</p> <p>While I will surely be able to offer my patients in England a coronavirus vaccine in a year or two, and while western health systems will be reinforced to be more ready for a potential future outbreak, I worry that we may repeat the mistakes of cholera: conquering coronavirus everywhere except for the poorest parts of the world.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>To reach my grandparents\u2019 house in Bihar, in north-east India, you have to take a car from Patna airport across one of the longest river bridges in the world, the Mahatma Gandhi Setu. This bridge takes you north over the river Ganges, past Hajipur, a city famous for its fragrant bananas, and up to Darbhanga, near the border with Nepal. When I was a child, the road was so damaged by the region\u2019s regular floods and monsoons that the journey, which would take just two hours in the UK, took seven hours, bumping over gut-lurching potholes. Today, the road is smooth and elevated, giving a spectacular view of the area\u2019s lush flood plains. They provide the perfect conditions for cultivating the fruits \u2013 mangoes, lychees and guava \u2013 that still flavour my memories of visits to my grandparents.</p> <p>The wet, semi-tropical conditions in the Ganges delta also make it a hotspot for water-borne diseases. And it is in northern India that cholera is thought to have originated several millennia ago, owing to the abundance of still water pools and Hindu ceremonies involving worshippers washing themselves in rivers. A 2,000-year-old <a href=\"https://mosaicscience.com/story/cholera-haiti/\" title=\"\">inscription</a> at a temple in Gujarat vividly describes the <a href=\"https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/cholera\" title=\"\">clinical picture</a> of patients afflicted by severe cholera: \u201cThe lips blue, the face haggard, the eyes hollow, the stomach sunk in, the limbs contracted and crumpled as if by fire.\u201d</p> <p>In the 19th century, the scientist Max von Pettenkofer believed, incorrectly, that cholera required certain soils and environmental factors unique to India, and so thought that it could not be contagious or endemic in Europe. But the persistence of cholera in this area has less to do with climate and more to do with political choices.</p> <p>Cholera is an infectious disease that turns on all the taps in your gut, so that water and salts pour out of your system, giving you copious watery diarrhoea that looks starchy, like rice water. This diarrhoea helps the infection spread between people, leaving a trail of victims so severely dehydrated that, if they don\u2019t receive treatment, they shrivel up like prunes within hours.</p> <p>For centuries, cholera only caused localised epidemics in north-east India. That was until 1817, when one of these outbreaks, originating in Bengal, spread across the world, starting the first of seven cholera pandemics. But just as Wuhan cannot be blamed for the current Covid-19 pandemic, we cannot hold this region responsible for cholera\u2019s spread, any more than North America should be blamed for the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic, which <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/information_h1n1_virus_qa.htm\" title=\"\">originated</a> in industrially farmed pigs. What the spread of these diseases has in common is international trade, and the movement of animals and people that comes with it.</p> <p>Empire shaped the history of cholera, and it was the economic concerns of imperial powers that brought cholera to heel in the west. But if imperialism was crucial to providing the impetus to end cholera, it also produced a logic that divided the world and only eliminated the disease from one half.</p> <p>In his book Plagues and Peoples, the historian William Hardy McNeill describes how the British army carried cholera overland into Nepal and Afghanistan, while British navy and merchant ships carried it beyond the Indian Ocean. That is how the first pandemic spread from the Bay of Bengal to south-east Asia, the Middle East, east Africa, and then to Europe by the early 1820s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a9c5ea40ee067a947cf54cdc894b72a5e4949e95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9c5ea40ee067a947cf54cdc894b72a5e4949e95/0_0_2048_1344/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A dam infected with cholera in South Africa in 2001.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A dam infected with cholera in South Africa in 2001.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SCHALK/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1831, cholera reached the north-east of England, the region where I grew up. One of the first victims, in Sunderland, was a 12-year-old girl called <a href=\"https://co-curate.ncl.ac.uk/resources/view/34622/\" title=\"\">Isabella Hazard</a>. Her illness was characteristically swift: she was entirely well one evening and dead the next afternoon. She was an early victim of the first of a series of waves of the disease that caused pandemonium in 19th-century Europe. Port cities, crucial to trade, were affected particularly badly.</p> <p>It is hard to imagine the panic created by the \u201cBlue Death\u201d, as cholera was nicknamed, because at the time its cause was a total mystery. The most common theory \u2013 that the disease was associated with \u201cbad airs\u201d (or \u201cmiasmas\u201d) \u2013 inspired desperate experiments to control it. In Kingston, Jamaica, for instance, British colonial officers tried to banish the disease by firing cannons through the streets \u201cto destroy the morbific power that lurked in the dark alleys\u201d.</p> <p>So cholera went on, unabated, in wave after wave of pandemics throughout the 19th century, causing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera_outbreaks_and_pandemics\" title=\"\">millions</a> of deaths, mainly in poor neighbourhoods. The working classes rioted across Europe, suspecting the disease was a conspiracy by the ruling elite, who they thought were poisoning them. In the 1830s, the revolutionary <a href=\"https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/133436/7/133436.pdf\" title=\"\">Mario Adorno</a> accused the Bourbon royal family of concocting \u201ca devilish plot bent on poisoning the people\u201d of Sicily with cholera, as part of his attempt to topple them.</p> <p>But disasters like pandemics are never just destructive \u2013 they also induce change, and often spark scientific developments and social reforms. The European imperial powers eventually started pouring resources into discovering the true cause of the disease, primarily to prevent the catastrophic economic downturns that accompanied every fresh outbreak. This investment led to three major developments that helped end cholera in the western world: reforms that improved public health, to stop populations getting the disease in the first place; the discovery of new medicines, to prevent and treat the disease; and international cooperation, to unite against a common enemy.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>In 1813, Frances Snow gave birth to her first child, John, in York. She and her husband, William, who worked at the local coal yard, raised John in one of the poorest parts of the city. Like Bihar in India, the area John grew up in was regularly affected by flooding, when the River Ouse broke its banks.</p> <p>When John became a doctor, he grew sceptical of the idea that cholera was caused by \u201cmiasmas\u201d. Instead, he suspected it had something to do with water. He famously proved his theory in 1854, during an outbreak in Soho which killed 616 people. He created a <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg\" title=\"\">dot map</a> of all the cholera cases in the area and spoke to the families to understand their daily habits, meticulously doing what we would today call contact tracing. He discovered that nearly everyone who had been afflicted used the same <a href=\"https://www.immunology.org/john-snows-pump-1854\" title=\"\">water pump</a> on Broad Street. Snow had the handle of the pump removed, making it unusable, which led to a sharp decline in cholera cases in Soho. It was later found that this particular well was shallow and had been contaminated by a nearby cesspit. In one elegant experiment, Snow had unveiled the spectre of cholera, which had haunted him since his childhood: the cause was just plain old dirty water.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f63a4072882a24e93c548103f07594c57fdadf08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f63a4072882a24e93c548103f07594c57fdadf08/0_512_2912_3640/800.jpg\" alt=\"A replica of the Soho water pump identified as the source of a cholera outbreak by John Snow in 1854.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A replica of the Soho water pump identified as the source of a cholera outbreak by John Snow in 1854.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was a problem for colonial powers, because their cities and colonies were unsanitary places. Rapid industrialisation had impoverished both English and Indian rural workers, triggering mass migrations to cities for work. Provided with no public amenities, these new migrants built makeshift homes in unhygienic and polluted slums. Snow\u2019s revelations led to the creation of \u201cImprovement Trusts\u201d and a Commission for Public Health in major cities across India, and these did improve the sanitary conditions, but largely only for British expats and colonial officers. By the end of British rule, clean water was available to nearly all British citizens in India, but <a href=\"https://swachhindia.ndtv.com/india70-a-brief-colonial-history-of-sanitation-in-india-10602/\" title=\"\">only 1%</a> of Indians outside the colonial walls.</p> <p>Today, <a href=\"http://pragati.nationalinterest.in/2014/08/indias-sanitation-story/\" title=\"\">more than half</a> of Indian households have no access to any kind of formal sanitation, meaning that they must defecate in the open, and 70% of sewage is untreated when it re-enters rivers and streams. As a result, up to 30,000 people in India die from cholera every year. Those who can afford it resort to digging their own water wells, deep into the ground. Given the trouble and expense my grandparents went to do this, I know the fact that their well-water still gives me an upset stomach, forcing me to drink bottled water when I visit, brings them great shame. But it isn\u2019t their fault; there is only so much individuals can do when their government refuses to invest enough to ensure clean water for all its people.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>John Snow\u2019s discovery was the first step towards halting cholera. But as the pandemic continued to ravage Europe, effective medicines were needed to prevent and treat the disease. And those could only be developed once scientists understood how dirty water made us sick.</p> <p>In Florence, a contemporary of Snow\u2019s spent his days with his eye pressed up against the cold brass ring of a microscope that he himself had designed. Filippo Pacini was a professor of pathology and a pioneer in the kingdom of the tiny; he had a gift for the new art of microscopy and was naming previously undiscovered parts of the human body when he was only 19. He was convinced that the cause of many medical mysteries, like the ones that afflicted his sisters for most of their lives, could be found through careful observation with this powerful new tool.</p> <p>Pacini <a href=\"http://ccras.nic.in/sites/default/files/viewpdf/jimh/BIIHM_1978/32%20to%2038.pdf\" title=\"\">studied</a> the organs of four patients who had died of cholera. He pored over their intestines with his microscope, and noticed the same thing was wrong in each. The lining of their gut was highly abnormal: not pink and rubbery as it should be, but pale and coming off in floppy sheets, like soggy newspaper. When he teased apart this lining with a tiny probe, he noticed that multitudes of tadpole-like dots emerged from the tissue.</p> <p>Pacini recognised that these dots \u2013 which he called \u201c<em>vibrios</em>\u201d (commas), because of their shape \u2013 must be the cause of cholera. He was the first person to observe for certain what had been speculated for centuries: that diseases could be caused by things too small to see by the naked eye. However, the scientific community failed to appreciate the value of his research, and his findings languished, largely ignored, for another three decades.</p> <p>Pacini had discovered the \u201cgerm\u201d, but it was not until the German physician Robert Koch himself discovered the comma bacillus in Egypt in 1883 that germ theory became popularised. During the following century, further research led to two crucial targeted therapies, based on breakthroughs by scientists from the Indian subcontinent shortly after it gained independence. In 1953, <a href=\"https://peoplepill.com/people/hemendra-nath-chatterjee/\" title=\"\">Hemanda Nath Chatterjee</a> developed a simple mix of salt and sugar that could be added to water to safely replace the copious fluids lost as diarrhoea. The basic recipe is still used today.</p> <p>Six years later, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambhu_Nath_De\" title=\"\">Sambhu Nath De</a> discovered that cholera released a poisonous toxin, which deserved just as much attention as the bacterium itself. Using modest equipment in a laboratory in Kolkata, he showed that the bacteria were not needed to make people sick. If they were stewed in a soupy culture, then removed \u2013 like whole spices \u2013 even just the remaining broth was enough to cause life-threatening intestinal damage and give all the symptoms of the disease.</p> <p>These discoveries transformed our understanding of cholera, and how it could be treated. They provided the basis of two new medicines: oral rehydration therapy, to replace lost salts; and a cholera vaccine, to induce an immune response against the bacteria and its toxin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ebed66dc9af682e5ab50e139d51a437d6b248c63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebed66dc9af682e5ab50e139d51a437d6b248c63/0_94_2883_1729/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A nurse giving sugar solution to a child suffering from cholera in Zimbabwe in 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A nurse giving sugar solution to a child suffering from cholera in Zimbabwe in 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philimon Bulawayo/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today, it\u2019s easy for westerners to get their hands on the <a href=\"https://jcdr.net/articles/PDF/13376/13050_F(SHU)_PF1(KB_SL)_PN(SL).pdf\" title=\"\">most effective vaccine</a>, Dukoral. Using it simply involves adding a vial of the liquid vaccine to water, together with a sachet of a granulated buffer that protects the vaccine from stomach acid. It\u2019s no harder than adding milk and sugar to tea. Two doses will induce an antibody response that will <a href=\"https://youtu.be/e4ZVQvVDH5c\" title=\"\">protect you</a> for about five years. But Dukoral cannot be used in the areas where cholera is most prevalent, because they don\u2019t have access to clean water, so taking the medicine could actually put people at risk. Besides, it is unaffordable in those places; to earn enough to pay for two doses, the average Briton would have to work for less than an hour, while the <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rs-6-000-is-6-of-a-small-farmer-s-annual-income-according-to-nsso-data/story-rddMw0hk6cSbxjo7E1GyKK.html\" title=\"\">average Indian farmer</a> would have to work for three whole days.</p> <p>There are other, cheaper cholera vaccines, such as Shanchol, which is manufactured by Shantha Biotechnics in India. This has the advantage of not needing any extra water, as it is poured directly into the mouth. But it is not as effective as Dukoral, as it does not protect you against the toxin, just the bacteria. Plus, it still requires two doses given two weeks apart. That\u2019s hardly feasible for healthcare workers trying to cover vast areas of rural India.</p> <p>There are many other obstacles to cholera vaccination programmes. To be effective, they must reach enough of the population to achieve herd immunity. This requires accurate surveillance, which is impossible without a strong and centralised public health system. Like the other countries where cholera is still endemic, India lacks this infrastructure, largely owing to the long shadow of colonial extraction, post-colonial debt, and loans granted by the IMF and the World Bank in the 1990s on the condition that the government reduce its spending, which led to cuts to public health and education programmes \u2013 the very things that a society needs to haul itself out of the conditions that stoke cholera.</p> <p>So although the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of the cholera vaccine in areas where cholera is endemic, and despite the existence of an easy-to-use vaccine which is manufactured in their own country, my relatives in their remote village in Bihar have not had it. But if I, as a westerner, want to visit them for a week, I can easily get it in the UK.</p> <p>Oral rehydration therapy and the cholera vaccine have greatly reduced cholera\u2019s reach in subsequent decades, but it has not gone away completely. Two years after Sambu Nath De\u2019s seminal research, a new pandemic \u2013 the seventh \u2013 sprung up in Indonesia and took hold in Asia and north Africa. This pandemic is still ongoing. More than a billion people live in countries at risk of the disease which, by no coincidence, are some of the poorest countries on earth.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>In the two decades after cholera first reached Europe, individual European nations, acting in isolation, tried in vain to prevent and contain it. But there was no point cleaning up port cities at great expense when you could not vouch for the sailors and cargo flowing through it. They eventually realised that a problem caused by globalisation required an international solution.</p> <p>This led to the first example of global cooperation in order to combat a disease. In 1851, the first <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30737-6/fulltext\" title=\"\">International Sanitary Conference</a>, convening the major European imperial powers, was held in Paris. Still, it took time for all those gathered to reach a consensus, and the first International Sanitary Conventions were not adopted until 1892.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781315613598/chapters/10.4324/9781315613598-7\" title=\"\">Anne-Emanuelle Birn</a>, a professor at the University of Toronto School of Public Health, trade was the driving motive of these meetings, and public health just a necessary means. They proved successful: transnational interventions, such as quarantine and disease surveillance by international health bureaux, did bring down cholera deaths. These International Sanitary Conferences proved the power of international cooperation to improve health and boost the economy, and provided the blueprint for the Health Organization of the League of Nations, and later the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/apr/10/world-health-organization-who-v-coronavirus-why-it-cant-handle-pandemic\" title=\"\">WHO</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps the greatest achievement of this cooperation came in 1979, when smallpox was eradicated globally. But unlike smallpox, cholera has not been eradicated \u2013 not because of some insurmountable biological hurdle, but because we have thrown our weight behind schemes that focus solely on cholera, rather than trying to end the poverty that makes such diseases likely. There are still about <a href=\"https://www.who.int/cholera/the-forgotten-pandemic/en/\" title=\"\">3 million cases</a> and 100,000 deaths from cholera every year, all entirely preventable. Based on recent estimates, from 1 January to 25 March of this year, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4455997/\" title=\"\">cholera</a> claimed more lives than the <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-toll/\" title=\"\">coronavirus</a>. But we are saying so much about coronavirus and so little about cholera because coronavirus has broken the unwritten rule that dangerous infections should not befall those in the west.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.who.int/gho/epidemic_diseases/cholera/cholera_009.jpg?ua=1\" title=\"\">map</a> of the places still struggling with cholera shows <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/06/maintaining-the-momentum-against-cholera/\" title=\"\">47 countries</a> \u2013 in Central America, sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia. This might seem to confirm that tropical countries are bound to nurture this bacteria, because of their warm climates and high population density. But the experience of the Marshall Islands, a remote Pacific archipelago that suffered a cholera outbreak at the end of 2000 and start of 2001, shows that there is nothing inevitable about where the disease takes its toll. As the University of Hawaii researchers Seiji Yamada and Wesley Palmer <a href=\"https://www.medicinasocial.info/index.php/socialmedicine/article/viewFile/12/211\" title=\"\">have shown</a>, two neighbouring islands there experienced very different fates \u2013 despite having similar climates and being just four miles apart.</p> <p>The US maintains a military base on Kwajalein Island, where the menial labour is carried out by low-paid workers who live on <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2016/07/116493/micronesia-ebeye-island-missile-test-photos#slide-1\" title=\"\">another nearby island, Ebeye</a>. Many of them are descended from refugees from other islands in the archipelago who were displaced by US weapons testing in the 40s and 50s. The housing and infrastructure provided to them on Ebeye by the military is not much better than a slum. The average household is home to <a href=\"https://www.tuftsgloballeadership.org/blog/isolation-and-disparity-kwajalein-atoll-noah-rose\" title=\"\">nine people</a>, so infections spread rapidly. The sewers pour their contents into lagoons where people swim and fish, and when it rains they overflow into the streets.</p> <p>At the time of the outbreak, there was no running water on Ebeye. Furthermore, since the land there was not fit for agriculture, traditional Marshallese ingredients were unavailable, and nearly all food was imported, unhealthy and expensive, leaving many malnourished. It was a ship bringing food to the island that is thought to have started the outbreak of 2000-2001.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2694bc371e8dbc130396fda3a396a24368d8d48d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2694bc371e8dbc130396fda3a396a24368d8d48d/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Reiss/USGS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Kwajalein Island, meanwhile, the residents are almost exclusively American expats who work for private military contractors. They live in detached villas with amenities like those of a beach resort, and the population density is 20 times less than that on Ebeye. Once the outbreak had begun, workers were only allowed to commute from Ebeye to Kwajalein if they could prove that they had received vaccination or prophylactic antibiotics. During the cholera outbreak, there were 400 cases and six deaths on Ebeye. However, on Kwajalein there was not a single case.</p> <p>What made contracting cholera so likely on Ebeye and so unlikely on Kwajalein has nothing to do with climate or geography. There is no biological or environmental reason why cholera cannot be eradicated for good in Ebeye, and Bihar, and right across the world. It is not the knowhow that is lacking, but rather the political will to extend these benefits to all people.</p> <p>It is now 200 years since the cholera pandemics began, more than 150 years since the bacteria was identified, and 60 years since an inexpensive treatment and vaccination regime was developed. And yet still this contagion is plaguing some countries as if none of that progress had ever happened. That is the real lesson of cholera.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>There are <a href=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/the-new-coronavirus-could-circulate-forever-says-experts\" title=\"\">fears</a> that coronavirus is now distributed so widely that, like cholera, it may be here for the long haul. It is not yet known whether this current coronavirus, Sars-CoV-2, will eventually mutate to cause milder, cold-like symptoms, like the <a href=\"https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/could-we-be-living-with-covid-19-forever\" title=\"\">four endemic coronaviruses</a>; or instead go the way of the first Sars coronavirus and remain as a deadly, but contained, infection. In either scenario, Sars-CoV-2 or a similar future virus could, like cholera, be eliminated only from the richer parts of the world, and left to circulate, with deadly consequences, in the world\u2019s poorest regions.</p> <p>The world will eventually recover a semblance of normality by adopting the same three techniques we used against cholera: prevention of transmission, targeted treatments and global cooperation between nations. But as we saw with cholera, all three strategies can exacerbate global divides, if they are applied selectively to protect only the richer half of the world.</p> <p>There are signs that this is happening already: from richer countries <a href=\"https://qz.com/africa/1805769/coronavirus-chinese-middlemen-deplete-africa-facemasks-supply/\" title=\"\">buying up</a> so much extra personal protective equipment that poor countries will be unable to obtain or afford enough to protect their health workers; to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/26/were-desperate-for-a-coronavirus-cure-but-at-what-cost-to-the-human-guinea-pigs-kenan-malik\" title=\"\">outsourcing</a> of coronavirus clinical trials to poor countries, like India, that will be less able to afford the vaccine once it is developed; to poor countries becoming blind spots in the world\u2019s gaze on coronavirus, because they lack the <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/openmovements/widening-data-divide-covid-19-and-global-south/\" title=\"\">digital infrastructure</a> necessary to collect comprehensive data about their outbreaks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3b411833015e0d8712b89b42b5a361903d5a1fa9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b411833015e0d8712b89b42b5a361903d5a1fa9/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An oral cholera vaccination being given in Bangladesh in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An oral cholera vaccination being given in Bangladesh in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paula Bronstein/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is hardly news that we live in an unequal world. In the 90s, global health experts began to refer to the so-called \u201c10/90 gap\u201d, based on the fact that only 10% of health research funding was addressing the health problems that affected 90% of the world\u2019s population. At the time, diarrhoeal diseases accounted for 7.2% of global disease burden, but attracted only 0.06% of health research investment. The 10/90 gap has remained largely unchanged. But with this new pandemic, we have an opportunity to put that right.</p> <p>Just as cholera gave birth to global health, coronavirus should trigger its latest reboot. Richard Smith, the former editor of the BMJ, <a href=\"https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2013/10/08/richard-smith-moving-from-global-heath-3-0-to-global-health-4-0/\" title=\"\">has compared</a> the stages of global health since the first cholera pandemics to the updates of an operating system. I welcome what he calls \u201cGlobal Health 4.0\u201d: namely, research and policy led by researchers and activists from poor countries. And while the WHO has not always lived up to its lofty goals, nor managed to achieve eradication of cholera as it did for smallpox, the solution is not to weaken it, as per Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/trump-decision-cut-who-funding-international-vandalism-coronavirus\" title=\"\">removal of funding</a>, but the opposite: it needs much more funding, and more independence from corporate donors, if it is to help tackle the socio-economic conditions that make us sick.</p> <p>Besides the basic moral argument for a system of public health and international cooperation that benefits all people, it is also in everyone\u2019s interests, because as long as infections blight poor countries, they will continue to pose a threat to the west, too. The Nigerian global health scholar Obijiofor Aginam <a href=\"https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1193&amp;context=ijgls\" title=\"\">has written</a> that \u201cenormous sacrifices must then be made by the developed world to confront mutual vulnerability\u201d. Coronavirus has reminded us, once again, of this mutual vulnerability.</p> <p>To prevent further pandemics, Aginam calls for a \u201ccommunitarian globalism\u201d: a bottom-up approach, \u201cbased on ideals of fairness, justice, and equitable distribution of scarce but moderate global resources\u201d. We have already seen glimpses of this kind of solidarity in the current crisis: from the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/aggressive-testing-contact-tracing-cooked-meals-how-the-indian-state-of-kerala-flattened-its-coronavirus-curve/2020/04/10/3352e470-783e-11ea-a311-adb1344719a9_story.html\" title=\"\">communist government in Kerala</a> giving food and shelter to migrant workers; to the <a href=\"https://english.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2020/3/30/somalia-sends-20-doctors-to-help-italys-coronavirus-effort\" title=\"\">Somalian doctors</a> offering their help in crisis zones such as Italy; to <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/democraciaabierta/cuba-time-coronavirus/\" title=\"\">Cuba allowing</a> an infected British cruise ship to dock to receive timely medical care by its doctors.</p> <p>There are, of course, important differences between coronavirus and cholera. The fact that coronavirus has a higher transmission rate than cholera, for instance, will make curbing its spread particularly challenging. But the lesson from cholera holds nonetheless. If we allow global health to be funded and governed by the old colonial logic that is embedded in its current structures, then the story will play out as it did for cholera.</p> <p>For now, I will continue to worry about my patients and colleagues in England, and how many of them will succumb to this virus. But while there are certainly better and worse ways to respond to the crisis here in the short term, history will judge us not just on who dies from coronavirus today, but in the centuries to come.</p> <p>For when my patients die during a pandemic in one of the richest countries in the world, it is of course a tragedy, but I can take comfort in the fact that it is an exceptional one, and that every effort is being made to prevent further such deaths. A much bigger moral failing would be if there are still people in the poorest parts of the earth dying of coronavirus in 2200. In 50 years\u2019 time, when I take the road north through Bihar to my ancestral home, I hope I will be able to buy a bunch of bananas in Hajipur without wearing a mask, and fill my nostrils with their sweetness.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Governments were caught out when Covid-19 hit, having overlooked the need to be able to test for new diseases because they were focused on drugs and vaccines for those they already knew about.</p> <p>Now there are fears that the rush to supply wealthier countries pressing for more tests may destabilise the fight against HIV, malaria and tuberculosis, illnesses that kill millions, mostly in low- and middle-income countries. </p> <p>\u201cSome companies are planning to reduce or stop malaria, HIV and TB test production,\u201d said Dr Catharina Boehme, the chief executive of the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (Find) and an adviser to the World Health Organization. \u201cThey are shifting their production to Covid-19 tests.\u201d</p> <p>Boehme said companies could get about 18 cents for a rapid malaria test and $10 for a Covid-19 test.</p> <p>The Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria said it was concerned about \u201cany action that might reduce the availability of tests or treatment for HIV, TB or malaria\u201d. </p> <p>Its executive director, Peter Sands, said: \u201cGiven the risk that Covid-19 undermines our continued progress in the fight against existing epidemics, this is not the time to be to doing anything that weakens our ability to diagnose and treat those infected with HIV, TB and malaria in a timely and cost-effective way. Doing so would cost lives.\u201d</p> <p>Diagnostics has been the poor relation to drugs and vaccines for years, as governments are now realising to their cost. The handful of countries that had specialised in diagnostics, including South Korea and Singapore, have had remarkable success in containing their epidemics. They were at a massive advantage.</p> <p>\u201cSouth Korea and Singapore both have a super strong diagnostics industry. Samsung, for example, has a diagnostics branch. A lot of the tech companies that we know more from mobile phones and so on have diagnostic branches,\u201d said Boehme. South Korea has factories that make tests for US and European companies.</p> <p>In Singapore, Sars was a wake-up call. In the aftermath, the government recognised an opportunity and invested in the diagnostics industry. Diagnostics are much more complicated than drugs and vaccines. India, which mass-produces cheap generic drugs for the world, does not have big diagnostics production.</p> <p>Germany, which has done more tests than any other country, got off to a flying start thanks to the virologist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/virologist-christian-drosten-germany-coronavirus-expert-interview\">Christian Drosten</a>, who produced the first test for Covid-19, backed by the WHO. In the UK, Public Health England took longer. Usually the Centers for Disease Control in the US is first off the blocks with new tests, but its did not work. It failed to pick up enough cases and also produced false positives.</p> <p>Germany had a large and excellent laboratory network and the advantage of being decentralised, so it could respond to outbreaks with extensive testing done on on a regional and local basis.</p> <p>By the time the UK decided to ramp up testing, it had similar problems as developing nations. There were stock-outs of testing kits and chemicals. </p> <p>Smaller nations had less trouble obtaining what they needed. \u201cThe UK is one of the largest countries. If they hadn\u2019t ordered large enough amounts early enough, they would have lost out,\u201d said Boehme.</p> <p>One of the handful of big companies with a US- and European-approved Covid-19 test is the BGI Group, a Chinese company that established testing in Wuhan at the start of the pandemic and then set up labs and testing in 11 other cities, which helped China get control of the outbreak. It was also involved in producing Ebola tests for Africa.</p> <p>It supplies coronavirus tests to Sweden, and one of its companies, MGI, recently agreed to supply 2m tests to France. MGI has also offered to help the UK. \u201cWe want to help. Our manufacturing capacity now is 2m tests per day and we are ramping up to meet demand as we see it,\u201d said Perla El Hage, MGI\u2019s district sales manager for northern and western Europe.</p> <p>Find is working with the WHO, Unicef, the World Food Programme and the Gates and Clinton foundations to obtain Covid-19 tests for low-income countries. It has a storage facility in Dubai. BGI is one of the companies that has helped, but the scale of need is a challenge.</p> <p>\u201cWe need an estimated 1bn tests in the next 12 months for low- and middle-income countries,\u201d said Boehme. \u201cRapid diagnostic tests would be the ideal in terms of ease of use and price, but right now there is still a WHO recommendation against them because we lack evidence.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-testing\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-testing&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus-testing&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The diagnostic tests identify an antigen in the virus, rather than the antibodies that the immune system may produce to fight it off. Like the antibody tests, they can be handheld tests that do not need lab processing. \u201cWe need tests that are at least 90% sensitive. The ongoing evaluation studies will show where we are. The sooner we can get these tests out, the better,\u201d said Boehme.</p> <p>Diagnostics are finally having their moment. On Monday there will be an international pledging conference for donor countries to promise funds for vaccines and work on epidemic preparedness. This time, it will include diagnostics. There is recognition of the crucial part they play in controlling a global pandemic, and acknowledgement that most countries have been very ill-prepared.</p>",
  "<p>My life of a millennial GP used to be simple \u2013 look after patients, then go home and enjoy life. The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic changed all of that. General practice is being attacked from all fronts \u2013 the years of neglect by successive federal governments leaving primary care struggling to cope with the challenges of a pandemic.

There have been exceptions though: patients who demand to be tested despite not meeting guidelines; employers demanding clearance certificates when told that is not possible; patients abusing reception staff when told the flu shot is not in stock yet or otherwise demanding that they be able to have it for free when clearly not eligible. Perhaps the most disappointing is patients ignorantly or wilfully exposing other patients and the staff to potential infection by not being truthful when asked screening questions, but telling you of their sore throat, runny nose or cough only in the consulting room. This is why some GPs choose not to see patients face to face.

Of course the convenience is appealing, but is it safe?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bc33b85f-c1a3-4934-922b-785c4f77d9a5\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>I have always been cranky with my receptionists when they fit in a patient for \u201cjust a script\u201d, \u201cjust a medical certificate\u201d or \u201cjust a referral\u201d. To me it is an opportunity for preventative care, to do blood pressures, check on routine bloods and cancer screening and to address little problems before they become bigger ones. These are opportunities that could not have been done with pop-up telehealth services but I am glad to be able to continue to do so as a GP. This continuity of care is highlighted by how efficient a telehealth consult is on a regular patient. Similarly, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia\u2019s advocacy to push community pharmacists to do flu shots, prescribe the contraceptive pill, or antibiotics for a urinary tract infection, are further attempts to fragment care \u2013 an appealing business decision at the expense of patient care.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/australias-small-medical-practices-on-brink-of-collapse-amid-coronavirus\">potential collapse of GP practices with the downturn in patients</a> has been highlighted in the media recently. This is not an issue unique to Covid-19 but one that it has accelerated. Medicare item numbers for GP consults were frozen from 2013 to 2018, with increases afterwards that are tokenistic at best. It is the reason why practices struggle to maintain bulk billing rates, as the burden of paying for increasing overheads, staff and medical supplies means that charging a gap is necessary for survival. Even when telehealth was introduced it was forbidden to charge a gap \u2013 effectively halving practice incomes on top of the downturn in patients. It is not a surprise that practices are struggling to stay afloat.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/australias-small-medical-practices-on-brink-of-collapse-amid-coronavirus\">Australia's small medical practices on brink of collapse amid coronavirus</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Funding general practice doesn\u2019t win votes.

  "<p><strong>Now that lockdown restrictions are easing a little bit in my area [Australia], my family\u2019s been getting a few requests for playdates and dinner visits. It\u2019s exciting but we don\u2019t want to turn our lives into a rotating door of visits and visitors, because there is still risk out there. One of the people who\u2019s been quite persistent in inviting us over lives nearby, and volunteers for the same organisation as me. But geography is where the closeness ends \u2013 we don\u2019t have that much in common and, face to face, our conversations are often awkward. If we\u2019re going to expand our small circle we want to prioritise people we like better. Is there a polite way of telling someone we don\u2019t want them in our bubble?<br></strong><br><em><strong>Eleanor says: </strong></em>I\u2019ve been waiting for this moment, the one where our reaction to the risk starts to change, even though the risk itself stays more or less the same. In normal circumstances we expect our reactions to have a half-life: when there\u2019s a fact we can\u2019t change, like \u201cshe left me\u201d or \u201cI didn\u2019t get the promotion\u201d, there\u2019s a point when we\u2019re meant to move on.</p> <p>But when the fact is an ongoing risk, instead of something that recedes into the past, it\u2019s not clear how long our reactions should last. We don\u2019t know what the half-life of fear is meant to be. To some of us it feels as though the fear should be dissolving by now: we\u2019ve had the big reaction, we\u2019ve processed the horror and, like any other grief or upheaval, there\u2019s a point where we need to return to normalcy.</p> <p>But for others it doesn\u2019t make sense to think in terms of an arc towards normalcy. This was not, in the first instance, a narrative point for us to integrate. It\u2019s just a virus, and a virus can kill you wherever you\u2019re up to in emotionally processing it.</p> <p>This split means a lot of us will be asking your question in the next month. We\u2019ll move at different paces towards deciding that this mortal risk can fade to the background, along with all the other death risks that we don\u2019t structure our lives around, such as plane crashes and heart attacks. When our friends and family let it fade faster than we have, how can we politely maintain our own still-reasonable fear and the decisions that come from it?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/22/self-isolation-is-bringing-out-the-worst-in-some-how-do-we-avoid-conflict\">'Self-isolation is bringing out the worst in some. How do we avoid conflict?'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One useful thing to keep in your arsenal is the move of expressing a preference while not insisting on its reasonableness. People might interpret your more careful approach to social distancing as an attack on their more relaxed one, but you can get ahead of that defensiveness by not presenting your preferences as the objectively right ones.</p> <p>Slight self-effacement about your decision may be your friend: \u201cThank you so much for thinking of us, but we\u2019re still being overly cautious about social distancing.\u201d Or you could exploit the fact that these decisions have to be made in household-sized units, and be vague about whose decision it was to decline this particular invitation: \u201cSome of us aren\u2019t feeling quite ready for full social contact yet.\u201d</p> <p>This is a rare moment when excluding people from our social groups doesn\u2019t need to be solely a function of the fact we don\u2019t like them. Normally declining invitations communicates that, and that\u2019s what makes it so tricky. But this time, they can posit any number of explanations for why you\u2019ve said no. Maybe you\u2019re still scared; maybe you\u2019re close to someone with an autoimmune condition. If the way you decline doesn\u2019t gently imply that they don\u2019t make the inner circle, they\u2019re unlikely to conclude that\u2019s why you said no.</p> <p>This is an opportunity for you and your neighbours to handle each others\u2019 approaches with grace. Try not to dodge it with an outright lie, tempting as that is \u2013 we all need to practice this kind of interaction, because the next few months are going to be filled with them.

  "<p>As Australia and New Zealand tentatively celebrate successes in their battles to bring Covid-19 under control, Winston Peters, New Zealand\u2019s deputy prime minister, has raised the possibility of the two nations opening up travel to one another.</p> <p>The mooted \u201ctrans-Tasman bubble\u201d would allow travel between these two countries, which seem \u2013 for now \u2013 to have brought infection rates under control, while keeping their borders with the rest of the world closed or tightly managed.</p> <p>While this seems like an excellent idea, it is one that needs go further. Specifically this spirit of neighbourliness needs to be extended to the small island states of the Pacific. Aside from giving real substance to Canberra\u2019s talk of a \u201cstep-up\u201d in the region, if managed carefully, medically there is little to lose and economically there is much to gain from this approach.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/its-catastrophic-fijis-colossal-tourism-sector-devastated-by-coronavirus\">'It's catastrophic': Fiji's colossal tourism sector devastated by coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pacific nations have been successful in preventing the spread of Covid-19 within their territories. American Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands and France\u2019s Pacific territories have reported cases, as have Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste, but of the independent island states only Fiji has been more exposed \u2013 18 cases with no deaths and no new infections in more than a week. Once eradicated, there is no rational case for not allowing travel to and from Pacific Island states to Australia and New Zealand, should this be something that Pacific nations want.</p> <p>Expanding a potential trans-Tasman bubble to the Pacific could help to stop its tourist industry from withering on the vine. Vanuatu, Fiji, Palau and the Cook Islands are all friends who depend upon Australian and New Zealand visitors for a substantial part of their economy, and we should not be leaving them out to dry now.</p> <p>The impact on these nations from the lack of international tourists has already been devastating. In Fiji, where tourism contributes nearly 40% of GDP, nearly 300 hotel and resorts have closed, and tens of thousands of people have already lost their jobs. A recent survey of more than 250 tourism businesses in Vanuatu suggested drops of 70% of full-time and 33% of part-time employment in the sector as a result of Covid-19 impacts.</p> <p>Going the other way, the Pacific has become an important source of seasonal harvest labour for Australia and New Zealand, and reopening the borders is one way of maintaining this. During the financial year 2018-19, some 12,000 workers from the region spent time in Australia as part of the Seasonal Worker Program (SWP), and if it hadn\u2019t been for the pandemic the numbers would have been even higher this year.</p> <p>The issue of whether or not the closure of borders will disrupt Australia\u2019s food supply-chain is complicated. Some farmers report being <a href=\"https://www.portnews.com.au/story/6711563/foreign-workers-turn-to-farm-jobs/?cs=9397\">overwhelmed</a> by trapped backpackers, others <a href=\"https://www.theland.com.au/story/6684575/covid-19-to-affect-agricultural-labour/\">worry</a> that if borders remain closed into the latter half of 2020, fruit and veg may go unpicked.</p> <p>News that seasonal workers currently in Australia can extend their visas by a year is welcome, but a temporary fix. Especially when we factor in the importance that remittances from Australia have for many households in places like Vanuatu and Tonga the case for reopening the gates to seasonal workers, and perhaps even expanding the SWP is a strong one.</p> <p>While supporting Pacific households and Australian farms are excellent reasons to advocate for opening our borders to Pacific Island states one aspect of this issue that does require some soul-searching is the degree to which such action would also be motivated by a spirit of competition with China. Some have argued that a trans-Pacific bubble could be a way of strengthening Australia\u2019s strategic interest in the region as China is making its presence felt there.</p> <p>Common as such <a href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2020/04/covid-19-escalates-the-china-australia-contest-in-the-pacific/\">reasoning</a> may be, the spirit of it is not in anyone\u2019s best interest, especially at a time of acute crisis. Anti-Chinese sentiment has a long history in both Australia and the <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2006/04/2008410133858407379.html\">Pacific</a> and responsible policy-makers must not give oxygen to some of the paranoid rubbish that is out there. The question Australians need to be asking themselves is not how we can compete with China but how we might cooperate with it to help our more neighbours through an economic storm they\u2019re ill-equipped to weather.</p> <p>Without a doubt reopening our borders to the Covid-19 clear nations of the Pacific would pose more of a challenge than setting up a trans-Tansman bubble. Great care would need to be taken to work with Pacific governments and communities to ensure their great work at keeping the virus out was not undermined and any inclusion would have to be at the invitation of Pacific governments. Yesterday <a href=\"https://matangitonga.to/2020/04/30/tonga-not-ready_for_covid-19\">Matangi Tonga reported</a> that Tonga\u2019s top health official, Siale \u2018Akau\u2019ola said Tonga was not ready to reopen borders and when it did it would be first to countries with no recorded cases of the virus, such as Samoa and Vanuatu.</p> <p>However if Pacific nations wanted it, their inclusion in a trans-Pacific, rather than trans-Tasman travel bubble could be an act of goodwill that would better the lives of thousands and be appreciated for decades to come.</p> <p><em>Michael Rose is a research fellow and anthropologist from the Australian National University.</em></p>",
  "<p>The plight of the romantic comedy over the past decade has, for me, been painful to watch. Once a staple of the multiplex, low-to-mid-budget romcoms in the vein of Suddenly 30 or How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days have all but disappeared from screens, replaced by gross-out bro comedies, superhero movies, and, on the other end of the spectrum, \u201cimportant\u201d films.</p> <p>Most people probably don\u2019t yearn for another Legally Blonde, but for someone like me \u2013 whose childhood was filled with DVD screenings of ultra-saturated stories of hardened career girls and their quests for love \u2013 there\u2019s nothing like a humble romcom.

Created by Sex and the City\u2019s Darren Star, Younger ticks all the boxes on my perfect romcom checklist: it has a bizarre premise (a 40-something divorcee, played by Sutton Foster, pretends to be 27 in order to get a publishing job); a cast of quirky gal-pals (Hillary Duff as a savvy careerist, Molly Bernard as a wacky publicist, Debi Mazar as a wise lesbian artist); a saucy love triangle (Foster\u2019s Liza is caught between her staid, enigmatic CEO, and a sensitive, chiseled tattoo artist); and a hardened-but-caring boss, played hilariously by Miriam Shor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c976533d5928cfdfba655b1f4bcdd475dbc56475\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c976533d5928cfdfba655b1f4bcdd475dbc56475/0_0_2000_1154/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Molly Bernard, Hillary Duff and Sutton Foster in season four of Younger.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"577\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Molly Bernard, Hillary Duff and Sutton Foster in season four of Younger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like all the best romcoms, the show\u2019s leads have entry-level jobs in a dying industry (in this case, publishing), but can somehow afford designer outfits and glamorous Williamsburg lofts; they attend parties every evening and still manage to find time to read thousand-page manuscripts and marketing plans. In Younger\u2019s version of publishing, business meetings are more often than not excuses to drink heavily or dive into a rooftop pool, and signing an author often involves going on a few dates with them, too. Younger is a fairytale, and it\u2019s all the better for it.</p> <p>And like many from the genre\u2019s Golden Age (roughly 2001\u201308, in my estimation), the show also provides a slyly salient critique of the feminist mores of its time. In the same way that Bridget Jones\u2019 Diary smartly found comedy in the tension between its title character\u2019s desire for a romantic partner and her desire to not need a romantic partner \u2013 in the process skewering the concept of \u201cHaving It All\u201d <strong>\u2013</strong> Younger picks apart the corporatisation of identity politics with a surprisingly ruthless eye.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/29/why-romcoms-have-all-the-answers-film-eva-wiseman-modern-love\">Why romcoms have all the answers | Eva Wiseman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many episodes introduce thinly veiled stand-ins for feminist authors like Lena Dunham and Cat Marnell, using them as an opportunity to expose the narcissism that often underscored 2010s girl-boss feminism; other plot lines ponder why youthful activists seem to abhor every kind of discrimination except ageism, the bogeyman that follows Liza around every corner in the form of new fads and social standards.</p> <p>One particularly great episode involves Duff\u2019s character Kelsey attending a networking function at feminist co-working space The Nest, only to find that it\u2019s more of an opportunity for rich attendees to shill their products and talk up their credentials than an opportunity to connect. The episode aired years before a New York Times<em> </em>expose alleged that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/magazine/the-wing.html\">The Nest\u2019s real-life analogue, The Wing, was doing the same thing</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s this tonal sweet-spot \u2013 shrewd where it counts, blithely far-fetched everywhere else \u2013 that keeps me coming back to Younger. At its worst, it\u2019s still a well-acted, delightfully lightweight confection; at its sharpest, it feels strangely essential, carrying the torch of the best 2000s romcoms and forging a new path for mid-budget, female-centric comedies. For me, the romantic comedy is, sadly, dead. Long live Younger.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Younger is streaming in Australia on Stan</em></p>",

On Wednesday, Maloney was appointed to the select committee on the coronavirus crisis, a new oversight committee.<br><br>Here\u2019s Patel\u2019s statement:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Carolyn Maloney spent decades as an anti-vaccine movement leader giving validity to a dangerous creed threatening public health and the most vulnerable. </em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>The history of Maloney\u2019s anti-vaccine stances is long and dangerous: she authored ani-vaccine legislation; angrily berated a CDC Director during a congressional hearing because the CDC Director would not agree that vaccines cause autism; led a radical group of activists in a \u2018Green the Vaccine\u2019 rally outside of the steps of Congress; hosted radical anti-vaccine activists in Congress; and regularly claimed vaccines were as dangerous as smoking. <br></em></p> <p><em>It is dangerous and unthinkable to elevate her anti-science voice during the coronavirus crisis. The world is waiting on a vaccine to bring this horror to an end. This is no time to hand the mic to someone who endangers public health by questioning science. Appointing her to this position begs the question: How is a committee tasked with overseeing the development of a COVID-19 vaccine credible if Maloney, an anti-vaccine activist that questions the CDC\u2019s scientific findings on vaccines, is one of its leaders? <br></em></p> <p><em>Now more than ever we need elected officials who trust doctors, medicine, and science.

In a 2012 congressional testimony on autism, according to <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/03/11/maloney-no-longer-believes-vaccines-cause-autism/\">the New York Post</a>, Maloney said:<br><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And you\u2019ve got to listen, you know, to \u2014 I remember smoking.

But on the ground, the implementation is often bureaucratic and bumbling and the measures more tedious and overbearing than intimidating.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/chinese-hit-road-again-first-national-holiday-since-lockdown\">Chinese to hit the road again on first national holiday since lockdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A week into my quarantine, I was told to start filling in a daily sheet on whether or not I have experienced a cough, sore throat, fatigue, runny nose, aches, diarrhoea or vomiting that day - ticking yes or no for each symptom. A day later, Du said I would also need to submit my temperature five times a day - every three hours from 9am to 9pm. I negotiated the check-ins down to the original twice a day.</p> <p>There are loopholes and inconsistencies. A friend in what is called \u201ccentralised quarantine\u201d at a designated hotel, mainly for those who have come from overseas, has snuck out several times, wandering the halls and going to the building\u2019s roof. Other apartment compounds have asked returning residents to simply promise not to go out.</p> <p>In some cases, the processes appear to be well-planned but little effort has been made to communicate to people what will happen. In March, my husband was put into centralised quarantine and delivered to a hotel with nothing more than a list of instructions in Chinese on how to report his temperature and when he could open his windows. There were no details about how he would get meals or water. \u201cFor any questions, contact the work group,\u201d it said, without listing any contact information.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b52f24e2f68e9d038db86e202646a0180f70b692\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b52f24e2f68e9d038db86e202646a0180f70b692/2_0_2995_1798/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Students at Hubei\u2019s Wuchang high school receive coronavirus tests.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Students at Hubei\u2019s Wuchang high school receive coronavirus tests.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: China News Service via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Both residents and the people in charge of their quarantines are at the mercy of vague policies, announced with little warning. In one of our more personal exchanges, Du said my quarantine would be extended by seven extra days.</p> <p>She listened patiently while I had a minor meltdown, demanding to know how they could arbitrarily lock me at home for three weeks. \u201cI understand how you feel, and a lot of people feel the way you do,\u201d she said, promising she would take it up with her superiors.</p> <p>After 14 days of working from home, doing workout videos and cooking elaborate meals for myself, I finally got a chance to see Du. She was younger than I expected, dressed in a face mask, gloves and a red armband identifying herself as a community volunteer. She was with two medics in full hazmat suits who had come to test whether or not I have the virus. As I squatted down in front of my door so a medic could swab my throat, Du filmed the exchange on her mobile phone.</p> <p>Later that day, Beijing officials announced the city was downgrading its emergency response level. I sent Du and others several messages highlighting the part of the press conference that seemed to mean I was no longer subject to an extra week of quarantine. No one responded except to say they had not received any directive yet.</p> <p>The next morning, a man came to take the sensor off my door. As he tugged at the device and scraped at the adhesive, I asked whether or not I could leave. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask someone else.\u201d</p>"
