  "<p>The first that staff at Nonga General Hospital in Papua New Guinea heard that they had been treating someone with coronavirus, was when they saw the country\u2019s prime minister announce it in televised press conference on Monday.</p> <p>They had been treating the patient, a volunteer health worker at the hospital, for pneumonia. She originally came into the hospital in late March, but recovered and was discharged, before her symptoms worsened and she was readmitted.</p> <p>\u201cThis person wasn\u2019t put into isolation or even a different ward. She has been walking around freely in the past few days and talking with us, so we are scared.

The case was detected in a village near Rabaul, a harbourside town on the island of East New Britain.</p> <p>The prospect of the arrival of coronavirus in a country with just 500 doctors and around 5,000 hospital beds and which struggles to deal with even routine illnesses has terrified the public.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ac666efa4af126bdb39d6eaa2f081b8e894f77a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ac666efa4af126bdb39d6eaa2f081b8e894f77a/0_0_3543_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A medicine dispensery at the Warangoi clinic in East New Britain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A medicine dispensery at the Warangoi clinic in East New Britain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kalo Fainu/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Health workers are asking how the nation\u2019s fractured health system, which routinely leaves clinics without soap or disinfectant and where nurses report using nappies as gauze to mop up blood and rice packets in lieu of gloves, would deal with an outbreak. The country is already dealing with outbreaks of malaria, dengue fever, drug-resistant tuberculosis and polio.</p> <p>\u201cWhen one [Covid-19 case] is confirmed, it is a disaster for us. It is already an outbreak,\u201d said Melke, who has spent more than 40 years working in Papua New Guinea\u2019s beleaguered health system and is the Nursing Union Leader for New Guinea Islands.</p> <p>\u201cWe are the frontline, but we do not have safety equipment to protect us, so how can we save others? We put our own families at risk.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018I will look out for them, I can die\u2019</h2> <p>After the case was announced by the prime minister on Monday, staff at Nonga General Hospital walked out of the building, refusing to continue working until they knew more.</p> <p>Deputy chief physician at Nonga Hospital, Dr Alexander Maha, confirmed there was a walkout of staff, but said things settled quickly and staff were given the option to leave if they did not wish to be part of the frontline team. He also said it was protocol for the cases to be announced by the prime minister.</p> <p>Maha says a section of one of the wards has now been cleared and set up as an isolation area for suspected Covid-19 cases.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"5e07db8e73b7cf39074cba14d47b735a971d6db7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e07db8e73b7cf39074cba14d47b735a971d6db7/0_0_3543_2657/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman holds her child as they wait for medicine at the dispensary at Warangoi Helth Clinic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman holds her child as they wait for medicine at the dispensary at Warangoi Helth Clinic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kalo Fainu/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cA huge part of what we need to do now is to manage the fear\u201d, explains Dr Maha, \u201cso that others who present with Covid-19 symptoms do not go into hiding. We need them to know that if their results are positive, they are in good hands\u201d.</p> <p>The fear is acute, especially among health workers. Melke says there was a recent suspected case of coronavirus at Nonga Hospital and the patient was transferred multiple times between hospital departments as medical staff fled, too scared to touch the patient.</p> <p>\u201cFinally, one nurse put her hand up, declaring that she would sacrifice herself for the sake of the patient,\u201d said Melke, who recalls the nurse said: \u201c\u2018Larim mi suicide tasol, mi lukautim em, mi ken dai\u2019 [Let me suicide, I will look out for them, I can die] and she alone nursed the patient.\u201d</p> <p>The patient turned out to have pneumonia and was cleared of Covid-19.</p> <h2>\u2018There is no medicine\u2019</h2> <p>If anything, the fears are even more acute in rural health clinics, where the resources for nursing staff are even fewer.</p> <p>A two-hour drive from Rabaul on a road strewn with potholes and corrugation, is the rural health clinic at Warangoi, where nurses report working to the point of exhaustion in desperately under-resourced conditions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"353cecbcb25eb59efdacbf0f1529a4615a0d1553\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/353cecbcb25eb59efdacbf0f1529a4615a0d1553/0_0_3543_2657/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The emergency kits in the labour consist of two plastic boxes.

Keep to night-time rituals like brushing teeth and reading bedtime stories whenever possible. Find regular times for children to focus on schoolwork. Days may feel frantic, but small moments of structure can help create a sense of normalcy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/11/sesame-street-50th-anniversary\">'We know we're more than a TV show': how Sesame Street made it to 50</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If plans don\u2019t work out, pivot.

A Parent\u2019s Guide to Playful Learning for Children Ages 2 to 5, Truglio writes about turning everyday tasks into learning moments. Enlisting kids to create a shopping list can be a way to use the alphabet and build vocabulary. Building towers with blocks can mean talking about shapes, width and height. <a href=\"https://medium.com/sesame-street-caring-for-each-other/sesame-streets-tips-for-families-at-home-drawing-cooking-and-moving-together-55a76369e48e\">Cooking dinner or doing laundry</a> is a chance to practice math and measurements.</p> <p>A key, said Truglio, is to make learning playful. \u201cLean in and follow your child\u2019s interest,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not good is to do flashcards and rote learning. It\u2019s not very interesting. When children are playing, they\u2019re activated, they\u2019re invested in the learning. When they are trying to solve a problem, they learn through trial and error. They learn not to give up.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Coping with the \u2018for-now normal\u2019</strong></h2> <p>The pandemic is presenting a new kind of trauma, explained Akimi Gibson, vice-president and education publisher at Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit behind Sesame Street. \u201cThis trauma is universal. It has no cultural or economic bias.

For them, Sesame Street\u2019s message is simple: understand that you\u2019re human and take a breath.</p> <p>\u201cParents can\u2019t help children if they\u2019re not taking care of themselves. It\u2019s like oxygen on a plane.

For parents and caregivers, it has meant helping them understand they don\u2019t have to become the teacher.</p> <p>\u201cA parent has to be a caregiver, first and foremost,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cAnd the educator wants to maintain a status as teacher. The two are in it together for the interest of the child.\u201d</p> <p>At no point do the makers of Sesame Street say any of this will be easy. But neither did they suggest the future has to be grim.</p> <p>\u201cI hope [people can see] a picture of joy within this moment,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cThe act of rallying together toward a common goal is not a sad occasion.\u201d</p>",

It also took issue with Hancock\u2019s insistence that the NHS has enough PPE to go round but needs frontline staff to use \u201cno more and no less\u201d than they clinically require.</p> \n<p>Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA\u2019s chair, said: \u201cWe are dealing with an unknown, highly infectious, and potentially deadly virus that has already claimed the lives of several healthcare workers, including 11 doctors in the UK.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is absurd that the people trained to treat this disease are the ones who are not being appropriately protected \u2013 and without them, we face real disaster.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe note the government\u2019s announcement this afternoon \u2026 However, PPE should not be a \u2018precious resource\u2019 and for NHS staff facing shortages of protection they need today, they don\u2019t want to hear of a plan, but that this vital equipment is made available to the frontline now.\u201d</p> \n<p>Susan Masters, director of nursing at the Royal College of Nursing, also voiced scepticism that Hancock\u2019s pledges would end the supply problems that are causing alarm among staff, and denied nurses were misusing PPE. <br><br>Masters said: \u201cThese figures on deliveries are only impressive when nursing staff stop contacting me to say what they need to use wasn\u2019t available. The calls are still coming through \u2013 people are petrified. They have seen colleagues die already.<br><br>\u201cThings have improved in recent days and I credit the government with that. But the safety of nurses and care staff must not be compromised. They are pretty clear about what they need to do to stay safe and they will be angered by any suggestion they cause shortages by misusing kit.\u201d</p> \n<p>As well as promising to tackle what he acknowledged was the \u201cenormous challenge\u201d of ensuring PPE reaches those who need it, Hancock said lab capacity had been increased sufficiently to allow any health or social care worker who needs it, to be tested.</p> \n<p>He visited a newly opened \u201cmega-lab\u201d in Milton Keynes on Thursday and said 15 drive-through testing centres were available.</p> \n<p>He stressed the complexities of meeting demand for PPE against the background of rocketing global demand, and without a significant domestic supply sector.</p> \n<p>Diplomatic staff around the world have been pressed into service trying to source equipment, Hancock said, with Whitehall officials in London trying to organise transporting it to the UK.</p> \n<p>He praised firms, including Burberry and Rolls-Royce, which have turned their facilities to manufacturing PPE \u2013 and urged others to do so, based on requirements published by the government. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got production facilities, and you can meet our published specifications, we want to hear from you,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Appearing alongside Hancock, May underlined the toll, both physical and mental, that treating the virus is having on her frontline colleagues. But she said they were heartened by the public\u2019s support. \u201cThe rainbows and NHS signs in the windows lift me, and they lift my colleagues,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>She and Hancock emphasised the importance of the public continuing to use the NHS for conditions unrelated to the coronavirus.</p> \n<p><br></p>",

  "<p> It must have been six years ago or so that an anxious barrister knocked on the door of my cave-like office in Sydney\u2019s CBD with news about Asio\u2019s raids on a former intelligence agent known as Witness K, and Canberra lawyer Bernard Collaery.</p> <p>No sooner had he started to pick through the entrails, involving confiscated computers, files, documents, a USB stick and a passport, than he stopped mid-sentence. \u201cBugger, I shouldn\u2019t have brought my mobile phone with me.\u201d He dashed outside and left his phone on a ledge in the corridor \u2013 convinced the spooks were monitoring his whereabouts and his conversations about Collaery and Witness K.</p> <p>It was my first inkling of the furtiveness and paranoia surrounding Collaery, his work for Timor Leste and the bugging in 2004 of its ministerial offices by operatives of the Australian Security Intelligence Service. Witness K, acting on instructions from Asis head David Irvine, helped to plant remote-switch listening devices in the Timor Leste cabinet room.</p> <p>Collaery had straddled positions both as a lawyer for Witness K in an employment dispute with Asis and for the Timor Leste government \u2013 working for the bugger and the buggee. The aim of the eavesdropping was to maximise Australia\u2019s position at the negotiations over boundaries in the Timor Sea and who got the lion\u2019s share of the loot from the oil and gas resources.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/10/witness-k-and-the-outrageous-spy-scandal-that-failed-to-shame-australia\">Witness K and the 'outrageous' spy scandal that failed to shame Australia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In June 2018, Collaery and Witness K were summonsed to appear on charges alleging breaches variously of the criminal code and the Intelligence Services Act \u2013 conspiracy to communicate Asis information \u2013 and, in Collaery\u2019s case, also communicating Asis information to journalists at the ABC.</p> <p> The brief of evidence from the Commonwealth DPP had been sitting on the desk of former attorney general George Brandis for over two years. The AG\u2019s consent to the prosecution is required under the legislation. It was not until Christian Porter, red in tooth and claw, got his feet under the AG\u2019s desk that, with an amount of dispatch, the consent was signed.</p> <p>When he announced the prosecution on 28 June 2018, Porter said, hopefully: \u201cI would also encourage any member with an interest in this case to be conscious of the fact that the priority must be to allow the judicial process to be conducted without commentary which would impact on the fairness and regularity of those proceedings.\u201d</p> <p>You might wonder what planet Porter was orbiting when he signed off on that. Ever since, there have been protests outside the court in Canberra while countless preliminary skirmishes took place. There has been mounting public condemnation of the Commonwealth\u2019s insistence that these prosecutions are of such great importance to national security that the court should be closed and the hearing conducted in secret.</p> <p>And here we were thinking that it is the Howard-era government that is the real wrongdoer, defying international law to spy on a friendly and impoverished neighbour for commercial advantage.</p> <p>Deceitful doesn\u2019t even come close.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Political teeth marks are all over these prosecutions</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Witness K has already pleaded guilty to agreed facts relating to his preparation of an affidavit for an in-camera hearing at the Hague. He faces further hearings in the ACT magistrates\u2019 court in April. Collaery has more hearing dates in April which are no longer listed on the ACT courts website. In all, there have been <a href=\"https://justly.info/the-witness-k-and-bernard-collaery-hearings/\">30 or so scheduled hearings since the charges were laid</a>, most of them conducted in secret.</p> <p>Political teeth marks are all over these prosecutions, with Porter issuing a certificate that proceedings be held in closed court in the interests of national security. Yet the extent to which the court is closed is up to the presiding judge, David Mossop, of the ACT supreme court.</p> <p>No doubt he will weigh the principle of open justice and the danger to the rule of law if justice is shrouded, where reasons for findings of guilt or otherwise cannot be published, and as we\u2019ve seen in <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-05/witness-j-revealed-secret-trial/11764676\">the case of Witness J</a>, citizens can be secretly jailed, Stalin-style.</p> <p>The case against closing Collaery\u2019s court hearings was put in an <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2WR1Rft\">amicus curiae submission to the judge by Ernst Willheim</a>, a former senior officer of the Attorney General\u2019s Department and now a visiting fellow in the college of law at the the Australian National University. He also prepared a similar submission for the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2UJBtBE\">Witness K case</a>.</p> <p>Willheim submitted that the parties to the proceedings were unlikely to press arguments about open justice. Indeed, in the Collaery case it\u2019s understood there have been consent orders relating to secrecy, but not for the trial itself. He pressed the point that there needs to a non-party helping the court on the \u201cfundamental importance of openness in judicial proceedings\u201d.</p> <p>Should Collaery be convicted in a closed court, where the defendant\u2019s lawyers and the jury could not see all the evidence, then public confidence in the administration of justice would take a damaging turn for the worse.</p> <p>As it is, confidence is already a delicate flower. Judges and courts only have authority and community acceptance if justice is seen to be done, if reasons are explained openly and if fairness is the guiding principle.</p> <p>The Soviets were good at obtaining guilty verdicts in secret, which then were conveniently used for propaganda purposes because no one knew what really went on.</p> <p>Needless to say, Willheim\u2019s amicus submissions in both the Collaery and K cases were rejected by the courts \u2013 partly on the ground that the commonwealth is a \u201cmodel litigant\u201d. This is not a good omen, for if Covid-19 doesn\u2019t derail the proceedings in the short to medium term, Porter\u2019s submissions on the sanctity of national security could well hold sway with the same outcome in the long term.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/10/witness-k-and-the-outrageous-spy-scandal-that-failed-to-shame-australia\">Witness K and the 'outrageous' spy scandal that failed to shame Australia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is another powerful reason for openness. Collaery could call former prime minister John Howard and former foreign minister Alexander Downer to give evidence and it would be a calamity if the public couldn\u2019t hear their explanations for the bugging.</p> <p>None of which is to say that the accused are entirely without protections. There\u2019s <a href=\"http://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s80.html\">section 80 of the Constitution</a>, which requires trials for offences against any law of the Commonwealth to be tried by jury.</p> <p>A jury trial could be a worthwhile safeguard \u2013 then we could know whether representatives of the community gauge these proceedings as an overreach of prosecutorial and executive power. The former <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/lateline/australia-east-timor-spying-scandal:-senior-lawyer/6978896\">NSW DPP Nicholas Cowdery QC is of the view</a> that in bugging the Timor Leste ministers, Asis was acting beyond its statutory power.</p> <p>There is also the contention that a law that prohibits the disclosure of an illegal act by a public authority may infringe the freedom of political communication.</p> <p>The defence had filed affidavits from former minister for foreign affairs and trade Gareth Evans, former chief of the defence force Admiral Chris Barrie and former senior diplomat John McCarthy.</p> <p>Two other defence affidavits were from former presidents of Timor Leste, Xanana Gusmao and Jose Ramos Horta. The affidavits themselves are not yet public but justice Mossop told the court those affidavits were intended to directly challenge assertions by the attorney general that there would be a risk of prejudice to Australia\u2019s national security if certain information was disclosed publicly during the substantive criminal proceedings.</p> <p>There are other concerns that surround the cases. Witness K was due to give confidential evidence in proceedings at the international court of justice<strong> </strong>in the Hague where Timor Leste was seeking to set aside the treaty arrangements which it now knew to be tainted by Australia\u2019s bugging and eavesdropping.</p> <p>Shortly before he was expected to travel overseas for this purpose, his home was raised by Asio and his passport confiscated, and it remains confiscated. In normal court proceedings, it would be a contempt of court or a prejudice to the administration of justice if a witness is prevented from giving evidence.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Here is a case where we find national security is being played as a card to bully citizens, cast them in the role of 'terrorists' and cover-up the wrongdoing of a previous Coalition government</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Likewise, when Bernard Collaery\u2019s office was raided in December 2013, the security services took his brief relating to Timor Leste\u2019s arbitration proceedings.</p> <p>Undertakings were made by Brandis that, of course, Australia wouldn\u2019t stoop so low as to access the contents of this seized material \u2013 an undertaking that did not persuade the international court of justice.</p> <p>The court, instead, preferred to make binding orders to ensure that Australia did not use the material to disadvantage Timor Leste. There were 16 judges on the ICJ panel and with the exception of one of them, they agreed with the findings and orders.</p> <p>The dissenting voice was the former Australian jurist Ian Callinan, a Howard-era \u201cCapital C\u201d conservative appointed to the High Court in 1989.</p> <p>In his amicus curiae submission, Ernst Willheim said those undertakings to the ICJ left open the prospect that the ACT supreme court also might not be satisfied by assurances made by the attorney general about national security.</p> <p>Here is a case where we find national security is being played as a card to bully citizens, cast them in the role of \u201cterrorists\u201d and cover-up the wrongdoing of a previous Coalition government, of which the current attorney general is in a direct line of succession.</p> <p>In June 2018, Porter was anxious to emphasise that what he called \u201cthe judicial process\u201d should, in the interests of \u201cfairness\u201d, be conducted without commentary.</p> <p>Can a secret trial, where evidence is suppressed, be a fair trial? It could be that the moment justice Mossop rules that slabs of the proceedings be closed, then the accused would be off to the High Court seeking a ruling that secrecy is an abnegation of fairness.</p> <p>The attorney general wanted speed and silence; instead, he will get a case that has the potential to run on and on, accompanied by mounting public disgust.</p> <ul> <li><p>Richard Ackland publishes the law journals <a href=\"http://www.justinian.com.au/\">Justinian</a> and <a href=\"http://www.glj.com.au/\">Gazette of Law and Journalism</a>.

This week, despite widespread criticism and some late efforts by the governor to stop it, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/07/wisconsin-votes-controversial-election-coronavirus-us-election-2020\">Wisconsin still held in-person voting</a> in its primary, but most other states yet to vote have delayed theirs until June.</p> <h2>Why is Sanders staying on the Democratic primary ballot?</h2> <p>When Sanders suspended his campaign this week, he made it clear that <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/03/9540304/joe-biden-wins-bernie-sanders-women-voters\">he viewed Biden</a> as the party\u2019s de facto nominee. But that doesn\u2019t mean that Biden is automatically the official Democratic candidate \u2013 he still <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/22/us/politics/democratic-primary-dnc-superdelegates.html\">has to receive the party\u2019s nomination</a>, which happens at the Democratic national convention (now delayed from July to August). If Biden secures 1,991 pledged delegates at the DNC, which now seems likely, he will be the official nominee. Sanders has said he will stay on the ballot in states that are yet to hold their primaries, to continue to exert the influence of his leftist movement on the 2020 Democratic policy platform.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/10/trump-poll-numbers-dip-handling-coronavirus\">Trump's poll numbers dip over handling of coronavirus pandemic</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>How will the conventions work?</h2> <p>The Democratic national convention, where Biden, 77, is expected to be officially nominated as the party\u2019s presidential candidate, was due to be held in July in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which, like most other US cities, is grappling with coronavirus. It has been delayed to August, a week before the Republican national convention, when Trump, then 74 years old, will be officially named his party\u2019s nominee after facing no serious challengers.</p> <h2>Will campaigning continue?</h2> <p>Media coverage that would normally be all about the race for the White House is dominated instead by an extraordinary public health and economic crisis, with the US <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/04/01/coronavirus-latest-news/\">death toll from the virus expected to</a> be in the tens of thousands. Trump and Biden continue to work on the assumption that, come November, the worst of the pandemic will be over. The US held <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/21/us/politics/1918-flu-pandemic-elections.html\">midterm elections in 1918</a> even in the grip of the Spanish flu that killed 675,000 people nationwide. Meanwhile, the president controversially uses the daily White House coronavirus taskforce briefings to push his own political agenda, and Biden has been campaigning from home in Delaware, hoping to use a new digital strategy that includes a podcast to reach voters.</p> <h2>Could the election be carried out by vote-by-mail?</h2> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re in completely uncharted waters here and I don\u2019t think anybody knows what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.fordham.edu/info/24277/ma_in_elections_and_campaign_management_faculty/6866/monika_l_mcdermott\">Monika McDermott</a>, a political science professor at Fordham University in New York, recently told the Guardian. \u201cBy November the picture might be completely unrecognisable. We don\u2019t even know if the election is going to happen as scheduled. There\u2019s talk out there about postponing it or changing it to a mail-in-only election.\u201d</p> <p>If the election does go ahead as expected on 3 November, states that already allow early and absentee voting will be well placed. Washington state, for example, has carried out elections by mail for years and its primary last month went ahead as planned. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/paloma/the-trailer/2020/04/02/the-trailer-the-fear-and-politics-around-expanding-voting-by-mail/5e84980e602ff10d49ada414/\">But 17 states require some kind of excuse</a> for requesting an absentee ballot. Many would need to change their rules at huge cost to run a mail-only election.</p> <h2>What happens if a candidate becomes incapacitated?</h2> <p>If the president\u2019s cabinet and Congress agree the president is incapacitated, the 25th amendment to the US constitution states that the vice-president becomes acting president.</p> <p>No presidential candidate has ever died or become incapacitated between their nomination and the election. The procedures to replace a candidate are guided by federal and state laws and party regulations, but the situation would be unprecedented.</p>",

  "<p>The head of the British Medical Association has called on the government to urgently investigate if and why black, Asian and minority ethnic people are more vulnerable to Covid-19, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/not-ready-to-go-tributes-paid-to-uk-first-named-victims-of-coronavirus\">the first 10 doctors in the UK named as having died from the virus were all BAME</a>.</p> \n<p>Those doctors have ancestry in regions including Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Even allowing for the overrepresentation of BAME staff in the NHS \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/workforce-and-business/workforce-diversity/nhs-workforce/latest\">they comprise 44% of medical staff</a> compared with 14% of the population of England and Wales \u2013 the fact that they were all from ethnic minorities was \u201cextremely disturbing and worrying\u201d, the BMA chair said.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt face value, it seems hard to see how this can be random \u2013 to have the first 10 doctors of all being of BAME background,\u201d Dr Chaand Nagpaul said. \u201cNot only that, we also know that in terms of the BAME population, they make up about a third of those in intensive care. There\u2019s a disproportionate percentage of BAME people getting ill.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have heard the virus does not discriminate between individuals but there\u2019s no doubt there appears to be a manifest disproportionate severity of infection in BAME people and doctors. This has to be addressed \u2013 the government must act now.\u201d</p> \n<p>As well as the 10 doctors, three out of six nurses named as having died have also been BAME as was a hospital pharmacist and at least one healthcare assistant. The overall death figures in the UK have not been broken down by ethnicity but early research published this week showed that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/bame-groups-hit-harder-covid-19-than-white-people-uk\"> 35% of almost 2,000 patients in intensive care units were non-white</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"070e1ce7-43bd-462f-80b5-0be91d966238\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XPF35H9RLNE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Nagpaul said BAME health professionals were understandably concerned about the deaths of their colleagues and what it might mean for them. The BMA chair said it might be too early to get firm answers but that it needed to be investigated.</h2> \n<p>Among the factors he speculated could be contributing was whether BAME doctors felt less able to complain about inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE) \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/nhs-doctors-lacking-ppe-bullied-into-treating-covid-19-patients\">a recurring complaint among healthcare workers during the crisis</a> \u2013 thereby putting themselves in danger.</p> \n<p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/02/black-nhs-staff-more-likely-bullied-than-white-colleagues\">BAME doctors often feel bullied and harassed at higher levels</a> compared to their white counterparts,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are twice as likely not to raise concerns because of fears of recrimination.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said the death of BAME doctors was particularly upsetting because of \u201cthe vast majority \u2013 I think only one was born here \u2013 who have come from overseas and have given their lives to the NHS, to save the lives of others\u201d.</p> \n<p>Among the wider BAME population, he suggested the fact that many were in key worker roles, combined with their living arrangements, could be contributing to their disproportionate presence in intensive care units.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a high proportion of BAME people not able to stay at home, serving the nation, putting themselves at risk,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you add that to overcrowded and multigenerational occupancies, the infections can be brought back home and spread to other members of the family.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nagpaul questioned whether enough was being done in terms of translating information leaflets about Covid-19 and physical distancing for people for whom English is a second language, suggesting mosques and temples could be used by the government to help relay the message. He said difficulties speaking English could lead to problems accessing NHS 111 either online or on the phone.</p> \n<p>Nagpaul also highlighted the higher prevalence of diabetes, heart disease and kidney disease among BAME communities than in the white population, adding: \u201cPrevious inequalities will be greater at a time of crisis. This [coronavirus] may be bringing into focus historic inequalities facing BAME communities.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>He said the best advice for BAME doctors to protect themselves against Covid-19 until more was known about the virus was the same as for any of their colleagues: ensure they are wearing appropriate PPE. He urged them not to risk their life if it was not forthcoming.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe need to safeguard our BAME population and the BAME medical officers,\u201d he said \u201cThese are workers who are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/25/nhs-treating-minority-ethnic-doctors-as-outsiders\">already experiencing significant hardships working for the NHS</a>. They are serving the nation at a time of unprecedented crisis. The government must take steps to address this.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Department of Health and Social Care said it was working hard to protect all communities, adding that translations of the public information leaflet, posted to all 30 million households in the UK, were <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-information-leaflet\">available on its website</a>.</p>",
  "<p>NHS officials have said it has taken longer than anticipated to get the coronavirus volunteer programme up and running after many of the 750,000 who signed up complained that they had not yet been given jobs.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/astonishing-170000-people-sign-up-to-be-nhs-volunteers-in-15-hours-coronavirus\">extraordinary willingness</a> of the British public to help out has been considered one of the few bright points of the crisis, but only a few thousand tasks are being carried out around the country so far.</p> \n<p>With 2.5 million elderly and vulnerable people in the UK supposed to be receiving help from the scheme, there is concern that people who are self-isolating for at least 12 weeks could be falling through the safety net.</p> \n<p>Neil Churchill, an NHS England administrator working on the volunteer team, explained \u201cwhy it\u2019s taking time for you to get your first asks\u201d in a post on a Facebook group for volunteer helpers on Friday.</p> \n<p>He said there were \u201ca lot more [identities] to check\u201d than initially expected, and it was only after that that \u201cwe ask people in the NHS to make referrals\u201d. But NHS staff have also been slow to call for the volunteers to assist.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt just takes time for info to get through to every GP practice, every pharmacist and every discharge team. Referrals are in the thousands right now and we expect they will be in the tens of thousands soon,\u201d Churchill said.</p> \n<p>Volunteers are registered on the Good SAM app and, when signed in, wait for an alert indicating that a job needs doing. But Facebook groups for volunteers are full of people expressing disappointment that they have waited hours without being given a task.</p> \n<p>Dean Tonna, 57, from Leicester, said he signed up as soon as it was announced last month and was told that they would do DRB (Disclosure and Barring Service) checks and get back to him in a week. It took a bit longer than expected, but he was cleared to help last Thursday.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was sent a lot of instructions and have been on call ever since and in nearly 250 hours I have not had a single thing to do.

  "<p>Shall we check in with the Guardian\u2019s setters? How are they doing, and how is the lockdown affecting their puzzles?</p> <p>Looking at the first question first, you will be happy to hear that, on the whole, everyone seems largely well. As with the nation at large, we see the Great Time Availability Disparity. Some setters, with day jobs or volunteering cancelled, have far more time than usual to ponder crosswords. And many of the younger ones are having to schedule slots for setting where allowed by their new jobs as home-based teaching assistants.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2013/jul/11/crossword-blog-meet-setter-otterden\">Mask</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2013/jul/11/crossword-blog-meet-setter-otterden\">arade</a>, for example, had a very busy 2019 doing double the usual amount of work in his other capacity as proof-reader for puzzle magazines in an effort to have six months\u2019 worth of crosswords ready for Brexit (\u201cwhere is that now, news-wise!?\u201d, he adds) and now has \u201ca lovely hiatus\u201d offering puzzle time.

A big national event usually appears in puzzle form, if not in full-on themed crosswords, then via amusing references in clues.

But, apart from the time factor, is setting more difficult?</p> <p>The answer seems to be that it\u2019s not as easy \u2013 but still possible \u2013 to get into an playful frame of mind. Here\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/jan/05/crosswords-meet-the-setter-boatman\">Boatman</a> \u2026</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While I\u2019m busy with the mechanics, I can forget about the situation for a while, and I can find my way into whatever part of my brain it is that creates the fun.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2026 Puck \u2026</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Creativity and, in my case, Puckishness are essential to the process in order to stay fresh and witty, and those are inevitably a little harder to come by at present.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2026 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/aug/02/crossword-blog-meet-setter-pasquale\">Pasquale</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I set to entertain, whatever people\u2019s circumstances.</p> </blockquote> <p>So the supply keeps coming: trickier challenges for those who want a crossword to take up a chunk of their day and more straightforward puzzles for brand-new solvers (if you\u2019re one, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2020/mar/30/crossword-roundup-fancy-learning-cryptic-crosswords-during-coronavirus-lockdown\">we prepared a starter pack last month</a>).

And nothing gives away the game as to how badly Trump has handled this as Trump telling us now we have to forget about it when it\u2019s over.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has reversed course several times over the past couple weeks, such as when he visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on 6 March and said he knew a lot about the virus because his uncle was a \u201csuper-genius\u201d professor. \u201cThat was the day that Trump said anyone who wants a test will get a test, and now, he\u2019s cutting funding for testing,\u201d Meyers explained. \u201cAnd I know he\u2019d prefer it if we were all Drew Barrymore from 50 First Dates and we\u2019d wake up each morning and say: \u2018President Trump? Huh, I\u2019ll give that a chance.\u2019 But that\u2019s not how most of our brains work. We remember the things we\u2019ve said and we hold you to account for them.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Reporting of the illegal trade in antiquities from Iraq and Syria is leading to a false impression that the European market is flooded with looted items, according to a British Museum curator.</p> <p>St John Simpson, a senior curator and archaeologist in the British Museum\u2019s Middle East department, said a recent report claiming that more than 98% of items on some European markets did not have proven legal provenance \u2013 and in some cases could be linked to terrorist organisations \u2013 was misleading.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a very strong tendency to say that all objects without provenance are the produce of recent looting,\u201d he said. \u201cBut some objects have been circulating for decades, if not longer. It\u2019s a case of assessing each item on its own merits.\u201d</p> <p>Simpson said that in his role as an adviser for UK law enforcement on items that have been seized on exit or entry into the country, there has yet to be a proven case of a recently looted item from Syria being discovered in Britain.</p> <p>He said: \u201cI think the really telling statistic is that over the last eight years of the Syrian civil war we have yet to prove any objects have come into Britain that demonstrably come from looting in Syria,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are investigating cases at the moment but that is a remarkable figure.\u201d</p> <p>In March, a <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/illicit-trafficking-of-cultural-property/partnerships/research-institutes/illicid/\">UN-backed report</a> stated Germany had become an international destination for trafficking illegal antiquities from the eastern Mediterranean, including Iraq and Syria, with almost half of the 6,000 examined items coming from the two countries.</p> <p>The study, released by the German federal cultural foundation, looked at antiquities on sale in Germany between 2015 and 2018, and found only 2.1% had proven legal provenance.</p> <p>Markus Hilgert, general secretary of the foundation, said the report\u2019s findings were shocking, especially in light of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/27/syria-europe-moral-eu-helplessness\">EU trade restrictions</a> in place for both Iraq and Syria. \u201cIn view of the ongoing, extensive destruction and looting of archaeological cultural assets in Iraq and Syria, this is an alarming finding,\u201d Hilgert added.</p> <p>Simpson said in Syria there had been \u201cad-hoc and opportunistic looting\u201d but the picture painted by the German foundation\u2019s study was down to \u201crather simplistic\u201d reporting. \u201cPut it this way,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like see every one of those objects personally to be confident that they are from recent looting rather than older items or fakes.\u201d</p> <p>The curator said the situation in the UK is completely different from the 1990s, when large numbers of looted Iraqi items were sold. He called for \u201ccaution and curatorial intelligence\u201d to be used when deciding when and where items originated.</p> <p>\u201cSome of these objects floating around on the western market could actually come not from recent looting, they\u2019re probably coming from 1990s or 2003 looting,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The British Museum recently launched the Circulating Artefacts project, to \u201ccounteract looting and trafficking of cultural artefacts\u201d. It created a database of objects designed to help curb the trade in illicit objects from Sudan and Egypt.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/28/italys-new-ruins-heritage-sites-being-lost-to-neglect-and-looting\">Italy's new ruins: heritage sites being lost to neglect and looting</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But it has also been criticised for items in its collection that were acquired by looting, such as the Benin Bronzes, which were taken in a \u201cpunitive expedition\u201d led by British troops in 1897.</p> <p>Senegalese academic Felwine Sarr co-authored a report that recommended a restitution programme to transfer hundreds of items from European institutions to Africa.

  "<p>Kareem Zukari has endured a lot during the nine years of Syria\u2019s war. There have been missiles and bullets, loved ones killed, and the fear of being conscripted into the army or tortured in Bashar al-Assad\u2019s prisons. But no matter how bad things got, there was always food.</p> \n<p>\u201cNow there is so much poverty,\u201d the 25-year-old from the Damascus neighbourhood of Barzeh said. \u201cThere are families living on $200 [\u00a3160] a month, but I don\u2019t call that living. It\u2019s barely managing to eat. And now with the coronavirus some businessmen are capitalising on the panic and raising prices.\u201d He asked that his real name not be used for fear of repercussions.</p> \n<p>With Assad now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/28/syrian-regime-captures-maarat-al-numan-in-idlib\">back in control of most of Syria</a>, the government should be focusing on the challenge of rebuilding a country it bombed into ruins while trying to drive out rebel forces and extremist groups. But since January the value of the Syrian pound \u2013 last year trading at 500 to the dollar \u2013 has dropped off a cliff, reaching a record low of 1,360 to the dollar on the black market in late March. As a result, inflation and the cost of basic goods are soaring. Even subsidised bread is sometimes unavailable as Damascus <a href=\"https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/04/syria-regime-opposition-prices-wheat-crops-farmers-imports.html#ixzz6JCRm5IXx\">runs out of flour and wheat</a> reserves, relying on its Russian allies for emergency shipments.</p> \n<p>According to a UN report from 2019, 83% of people across both government and rebel parts of the country were already living in poverty.

Price increases for food, fuel and transport have even sparked rare protests against the government in places such as Sweida, a city in the south-west populated mostly by members of the Druze minority sect that has remained nominally loyal to the government throughout the war. Remarkably, no one was arrested: instead, the state news agency reported on the protests.</p> \n<p>Damascus is seeking to exploit the Covid-19 emergency with renewed calls for the end of international sanctions, which it says will alleviate both the health and economic crises.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>While Syria\u2019s broken healthcare system cannot cope with a major outbreak, relief from sanctions \u2013 which do not target the medical sector \u2013 is unlikely to reach Syrian civilians.</p> \n<p>\u201cEven if sanctions are lifted, the regime will remain broke.

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2009/jul/28/antonello-da-messina-renaissance-art\">Antonello</a> was one of the first Italian artists to explore the subtlety of oil paints, which he learned about from Flemish paintings that made their way to the court of Naples. Here he uses that refined skill to paint a very human, vulnerable Christ whose agony on the cross is all the more touching for being realistic, without the gore and horror of medieval art.

This enabled the Republican Scott Walker to win the governorship and Republicans to establish control of the legislature that they would cement through <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/blogs/wisconsin-voter/2018/12/06/wisconsin-gerrymandering-data-shows-stark-impact-redistricting/2219092002/\">gerrymandering</a>, a careful manipulation of district maps that allows politicians to pack favorable voters in their constituencies.</p> <p>What followed was a decade of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/87fabc13bf724009ae68972dce79d189/Wisconsin-AG-suggests-Voter-ID-helped-Trump-win-the-state\">voter ID</a> laws, reduced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/17/wisconsin-voting-rights-african-americans-republicans\">early voting periods</a> and efforts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/06/wisconsin-voter-purges-black-student-populations-risk\">purge voters</a> from the rolls, all with the purpose of maintaining Republican control.</p> <p>When Republicans eventually lost statewide offices in 2018, they convened a special session to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/wisconsin-republicans-are-trying-to-subvert-the-will-of-the-voters-theyre-part-of-a-larger-trend/2018/12/03/cf20dbd0-f72c-11e8-8d64-4e79db33382f_story.html\">strip those positions</a> of basic powers. A conservative state supreme court greenlit these actions. By the time I departed Wisconsin that year, the ruthless prioritization of partisan control had become deeply embedded in conservative political culture.</p> <p>That makes this week\u2019s flawed election all too predictable.</p> <p>\u201cYou are incredibly safe to go out,\u201d insisted the assembly speaker, Robin Vos, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/07/politics/wisconsin-robin-vos-protective-gear/index.html\">completely bedecked</a> in personal protective equipment. Wisconsin supreme court judges agreed, blocking Governor Tony Evers\u2019 bid to delay the election. And so, contrary to common sense and the advice of <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/04/08/coronavirus-wisconsin-election-likely-hurt-effort-flatten-curve/2961718001/\">public health experts</a>, the election proceeded.</p> <p>Why? The answer was simple. The key election on the ballot was for a seat on the state supreme court. Republicans calculated that polling stations in the mostly Republican rural and suburban areas would be quiet and open, and that polling places in more Democratic cities would be crowded or closed. Further, absentee ballot requests were rumored to skew <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/campaign-chronicles/why-is-wisconsin-holding-an-election-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=onsite-share&amp;utm_brand=the-new-yorker&amp;utm_social-type=earned\">whiter and richer.</a> Such a scenario helped their candidate, and would hurt the more liberal candidate.</p> <p>It worked. The largest city, Milwaukee, is also a pandemic hotspot. Unable to find poll workers, just five of Milwaukee\u2019s usual 180 polling places were open to serve a population of about 595,000. Those who braved it faced lines that wrapped around city blocks. Many in line were among the thousands who had requested absentee ballots that <a href=\"https://urbanmilwaukee.com/2020/04/06/where-are-the-missing-ballots/\">never arrived.</a></p> <p>A federal court attempted to give voters some breathing space by allowing them extra time to return ballots, and suspending a requirement to have a witness signature, infeasible at a time of social distancing. But the conservative majority of the US supreme court <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/04/supreme-court-wisconsin-absentee-ballots.html\">overruled</a> the lower court, forcing those who hadn\u2019t received their ballot to stand in line, and ruling any ballots returned without a witness signature to be null and void.</p> <p>Delaying the election would have also allowed timely delivery of mail ballots and moved in-person voting to a point when the coronavirus had subsided. We cannot pretend that those who risked their health in hours-long lines and those who completed their ballots safely in their home have an equal opportunity to participate in democracy.</p> <p>Evers acted late, but was the only public official to recognize the seriousness of the pandemic. Elections are ultimately the responsibility of the Republican-led legislature, who rebuffed Evers when he called for an all-mail election on 27 March and gaveled in and out without taking any action when Evers called a special session of the legislature on 3 April.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Wisconsin may be the canary in the coronavirus coalmine for the November elections</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It would be a mistake to categorize what happened this week as an isolated event, a forgivable lapse of judgment. Wisconsin has become a place where forcing crowded in-person voting during a pandemic is just the latest price for others to pay for a party with a win-at-all-costs mentality. This mentality, so dangerous for democracy, is not limited to Wisconsin, but is driven by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/12/5/18125544/north-carolina-power-grab-wisconsin-michigan-lame-duck\">Republicans</a> across the country changing the rules of the game to hold on to power.</p> <p>Now, Wisconsin may be the canary in the coronavirus coalmine for the November elections.

Some use Orwellian doublespeak \u2013 the Republican party chair characterized it as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/coronavirus-democrats-mail-voting-fraud-rnc-chair-ronna-mcdaniel\">the way to undermine democracy</a>\u201d \u2013 but Trump is characteristically <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/30/trump-voting-republicans/\">blunter</a>: \u201cIf you ever agreed to it you\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again.\u201d</p> <p>The emerging Republican position, crystallized in Wisconsin, is that democracy is a fine thing until you are in danger of losing power.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/donmoyn\">Donald Moynihan</a> is the McCourt </em><em>chair at the McCourt </em><em>school of </em><em>public </em><em>policy at Georgetown University</em></p>",
  "<p>Less than 72 hours before polls opened in Wisconsin on 7 April, the state legislature convened to weigh an <a href=\"https://evers.wi.gov/Documents/COVID19/EO073-SpecialSessionElections%20searchable.pdf\">emergency request</a> from the governor, Tony Evers. With Covid-19 cases in the thousands, Evers implored the lawmakers to delay in-person voting for the state\u2019s presidential primary and mail a ballot to every voter in the state.</p> <p>It was a meeting only in name. Republicans, who control 63 of 99 seats in the state assembly, sent just one member. He brought the session to order and then immediately ended it without taking up the governor\u2019s request.

Even in a state at the center of some of the most hard-nosed fights over voting, it was a stunning series of events.</p> <p>That assault on democracy began in 2011, when Republicans drew new lines for political districts in Wisconsin. It was part of a national Republican effort, called Project Redmap, to capture state legislatures and, with those victories, to gain control over redrawing the lines of each district. The goal of<a href=\"http://www.redistrictingmajorityproject.com/\"> R</a><a href=\"http://www.redistrictingmajorityproject.com/\">edmap</a> was to conjure districts that would advantage Republicans and disadvantage Democrats \u2013 a process called gerrymandering.

So far, turnout looks like it will be a fraction of what it was in 2016, and that is believed to benefit Republicans, who were seeking to maintain control of a seat on the conservative-leaning state supreme court. It was the state supreme court who voted along partisan lines to overrule Evers\u2019 last-minute effort and to allow the election to move forward.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Wisconsin had long held a reputation as a bipartisan state, and there had been fights over redistricting before. But in 2011, Republicans took it to a new level. They deployed mapmakers to the offices of a law firm across from the state capitol, where they drew different options for maps that tested how much of an advantage could be gained in districts. They closely regulated who had access to the room where maps were drawn, even requiring Republican lawmakers to <a href=\"http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/lawmakers-were-made-to-pledge-secrecy-over-redistricting-9643ep0-138826854.html/\">sign agreements</a> to keep discussions about the maps secret.</p> <p>Republicans understood that they were drawing maps to maintain power far beyond that year. \u201cThe maps we pass will determine who\u2019s here 10 years from now,\u201d one memo at the time read.<strong> </strong>One assembly district belonging to Andy Jorgensen, a Democrat in the state general assembly, was cracked into four different Republican-friendly districts, Daley wrote in Ratf**ked: Why Your Vote Doesn\u2019t Count.</p> <p>The plan worked almost exactly as the mapmakers predicted. In 2012, the first election with the new map in place, Republicans won less than half the votes, but conquered 60 of the state\u2019s 99 assembly seats. The Republicans grew their majority in 2014 and 2016, despite earning just over 50% of the statewide vote.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Republicans could act brazenly without fear because gerrymandered maps make it impossible for them to lose their majority</p> <footer> <cite>Michael Li, a voting rights expert at the Brennan Center at NYU</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt seems impervious to what happens with voters,\u201d said Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cIt really looks like an unresponsive institution.\u201d</p> <p>Michael Li, a voting rights expert at the non-partisan Brennan Center at NYU, wrote this week: \u201cWisconsin\u2019s maps are so gerrymandered that Republicans can win close to a supermajority of house seats with a <em>minority</em> of the vote.</p> <p>\u201cRepublicans could act brazenly without fear of electoral blowback because gerrymandered maps make it virtually impossible for them to ever lose their legislative majority,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/gerrymandering-meets-coronavirus-wisconsin\">he wrote</a>.

So they continue to restrict the electorate to advantage themselves.\u201d</p> <p>A few weeks after the 2016 election, Greenwood and a team of lawyers helped convince a three-judge panel to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/us/wisconsin-redistricting-found-to-unfairly-favor-republicans.html\">strike down</a> the gerrymandered assembly map, saying it was so severely manipulated that it violated the US constitution.

  "<p>Murder. Misery. Mobsters. Mayhem. A country in turmoil with financial disaster looming. A city on the brink of collapse, filled with characters on the make and the sense that if the end of the world is coming, then why not party the nights away. And, hanging over it all, the hint in the air of something very nasty, slouching just over the horizon.</p> <p>You might not think that Babylon Berlin, Sky Atlantic\u2019s big-budget German period drama \u2013 the third series of which reaches its conclusion tonight \u2013 would be the perfect lockdown bingewatch. But, frankly, you\u2019d be wrong.</p> <p>I understand there are plenty of people who reach for comfort at a time like this \u2013 it makes complete sense to curl up and relax with something that demands little but rewards well.</p> <p>But Tom Tykwer\u2019s ambitious adaptation of Volker Kutscher\u2019s police procedurals \u2013 the first two series of which aired in 2017 \u2013 offers something more. The chance to lose yourself in a fully realised and beautifully recreated world, populated by people you will come to genuinely care about, driven by tight plots and a wider story of how the after-effects of the first world war would send shockwaves through the German nation, eventually leading to the collapse of an all-too-brief progressive government and the subsequent rise to power of Adolf Hitler\u2019s Nazi party.</p> <p>It\u2019s a huge undertaking, but one that Tykwer and his team handle with ease, thanks in large part to an impressive commitment to detail.</p> <p>From the cross-dressing cabaret act performed by Countess Svetlana Sorokina AKA Nikoros (Severija Janu\u0161auskait\u0117) to the tiny room that would-be police detective, flapper and occasional sex worker Charlotte Ritter (Liv Lisa Fries) shares with a man she never sees, this is a faithful recreation of Weimar Germany, and one where no expense is spared.</p> <p>Similar care has been lavished on the characters, from surprisingly moral mobster Edgar Kasabian AKA the Armenian (noms de plume are something of a feature of the series) played with panache and just the right hint of menace by Mi\u0161el Mati\u010devi\u0107, to a troubled leading man in the form of Insp Gereon Rath (Volker Bruch), a war veteran with PTSD and a morphine habit who is in thrall to a mysterious psychiatrist, himself obsessed with the notion of an increasingly close relationship between man and machine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa3f3876c89d8d7da7a568f693c8382ca568b0b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa3f3876c89d8d7da7a568f693c8382ca568b0b5/0_369_5669_3404/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A touching partnership\u2019 ...

This experience is only exacerbated by the show\u2019s ability to convince you that this is the way Germany must have felt at that time \u2013 that feverish sense that everything was moving slowly out of control and that the only response was to dance harder, faster and more fervidly as the end of the world drew nigh.</p> <p>This third series is arguably the best yet. Beginning with a murder on a movie set \u2013 this being Babylon Berlin we were offered a glimpse of that movie, a pitch-perfect take on German expressionist film complete with a beautifully choreographed avant garde dance number that, like so much on this show, felt as though it must have really existed \u2013 it has widened out to take in the rise of rapacious capitalism in the unnerving shape of incredibly creepy businessman Alfred Nyssen (Lars Eidinger). We also see the growing poverty on the streets of Berlin, and a surprisingly touching three-way relationship between two gangsters and one of the men\u2019s actor wife.</p> <p>Throughout it all, Charlotte \u2013 wide-eyed and sharp-of-thought \u2013 has brought heart to the series, as she battles to save her childhood friend Greta from execution, while the more solemn Rath fights for justice for the dead film star and struggles to come to terms with his past, in particular a complicated relationship with his (possibly) dead brother\u2019s wife.</p> <p>Yet no matter how bad things get \u2013 and this being Babylon Berlin they often get pretty terrible \u2013 Rath and Ritter continue to support each other in one of the more touching detective partnerships on TV. It\u2019s one that has you rooting for him to overcome his demons and her to be given the recognition she deserves.</p> <p>Will tonight\u2019s concluding two episodes give them the happy-ish endings they desire?

  "<p>Since the coronavirus gripped Europe there has been one main theme to the emails pouring into the Guardian\u2019s Consumer Champions column: why is my airline refusing to give me a refund?</p> <p>The rules are quite clear: if a flight is cancelled, the airline has to offer you a refund. The <a href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Passengers/Resolving-travel-problems/Delays-cancellations/Your-rights/Your-rights-when-you-fly/\">Civil Aviation Authority</a> states explicitly that \u201cIf your flight has been cancelled, your airline must offer you the choice of a refund or alternative flight.\u201d</p> <p>But the airlines are trampling all over consumer law and the CAA appears to have abdicated responsibility for enforcing the rules.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/08/reschedule-flights-get-refund-airlines-easyjet-coronavirus\">Why can't we reschedule our flights or get a refund?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/08/reschedule-flights-get-refund-airlines-easyjet-coronavirus\">reported earlier in the week</a>, easyJet has removed its refund option from its website, obliging those who don\u2019t want to reschedule to join the lengthy queue for the helpline.</p> <p>British Airways is no better. Its <a href=\"https://www.britishairways.com/en-gb/information/incident/coronavirus/latest-information?dr=&amp;dt=British%20Airways%20%7C%20Book%20Flights,%20Holidays,%20City%20Breaks%20%26%20Check%20In%20Online&amp;scheme=&amp;audience=travel&amp;CUSTSEG=&amp;GGLMember=&amp;ban=%7C%7CP1M%7C%7C%7C%7C%7C%7C%7CHOME%7C%7C%7C%7CL4%7C%7C%7C%7Canonymous-inspiration%7C%7C%7C&amp;KMtag=c&amp;KMver=1.0&amp;clickpage=HOME\">website</a> simply says: \u201cIf your flight has been cancelled you can rebook or claim a voucher online\u201d, without any mention of your right to a refund.</p> <p>My brother has spent many hours fruitlessly trying to call the airline after it cancelled his \u00a3800 flight. There\u2019s no way to email the airline, or even an address for post. It\u2019s a matter of take the voucher \u2013 or wait endlessly in a call queue.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Ryanair bluntly says it cannot process refunds until the pandemic has subsided, and the best that passengers can hope for, right now, is a voucher valid for 12 months.</p> <p>Cue fury all round? Yes, people are right to be utterly frustrated at this behaviour and the denial of their rights.</p> <p>Yet I have a smidgen of sympathy for the airlines. They are on the peg for huge lease costs on now-grounded planes and are still paying a large chunk of staff costs. They are heading for losses of $252bn (\u00a3202bn) should the lockdown last three months, says the International Air Transport Association (Iata). Realistically, how are they going to cash-flow billions of pounds in refunds? It\u2019s not a surprise they are sticking their fingers in their ears and not picking up the phones.</p> <p>Is there a halfway house, a solution that might satisfy the majority of people yet not permanently erode consumer rights?</p> <p>The big problem with vouchers is the restrictions around their use. BA, Ryanair and easyJet say they are valid for 12 months only. Why? What if you don\u2019t plan another journey on a route served by that airline in the next year?</p> <p>Irish airline Aer Lingus has got it mostly right. Firstly, it has offered travellers a <a href=\"https://www.aerlingus.com/support/forms/voucher-refund-request-form/\">10% bonus</a> if they apply for a voucher; if you paid \u00a3100 for your flight, you\u2019ll get a voucher worth \u00a3110.</p> <p>Secondly, it lasts five years, not one. Aer Lingus is part of the same company, IAG, as British Airways, so it\u2019s a mystery why BA is not making the same offer.</p> <p>Thirdly, vouchers need to be fully transferable to other individuals without penalty. So if my brother were to accept a voucher for his cancelled \u00a3800 flight, he\u2019d get a \u00a3880 voucher that I or someone else will happily pay him \u00a3800 for. It\u2019s win-win-win. My brother gets his money back, I get a discount ticket, and the airline does not have to cash-flow a refund.</p> <p>I was asked to volunteer to come off an overbooked \u00a3250 BA flight from London to Bangkok in 1997. It offered me a \u00a3400 voucher, an overnight hotel at Heathrow and a definite seat the next day. The voucher had no expiry, and six years later I used it during a BA sale to buy two return tickets to New York. It was a total bargain. Vouchers really can work.</p> <p>The banks and credit card companies have offered coronavirus victims payment holidays. In a sense, opting for vouchers is giving a payment holiday to an airline while the business is in an almost impossible financial position.</p> <p>But if we do let the airlines go down this route, it should be time limited, and the usual rules reinstated when normal life resumes.</p> <p>It\u2019s certainly better than a taxpayer-funded bailout, which is what the airlines will demand if their cash runs out.</p> <p>But I write this working from home in an attic room. One of the few joys from the ghastly virus is to look up to a sky brilliantly free from vapour trails. Maybe once the issue of refunds is sorted, the question that will be ever more pressing is whether we should be flying so much anyway.</p>",

Ruling comfortably from their own living rooms, the five conservatives required these voters to leave their homes during a shelter-in-place order and placed them in the path of a virus. (On Wednesday, the day after the election, reports came of absentee ballots piled in post offices, undelivered.)</p> <p>That the supreme court intervened not on the side of voters and fair elections, but in order to protect particular Republican partisan interests, should be saddening, yet unsurprising.

Not in an emergency. Not at all. In 2013\u2019s Shelby County v Holder, a 5-4 court defanged the enforcement provisions of section V of the VRA and laid the groundwork for a decade of voter ID requirements, precinct closures and voter roll purges from states with documented histories of racist voting inequities.</p> <p>The legislatures behind those efforts, a 5-4 court decreed in 2018\u2019s Abbott v Texas, must be awarded the \u201cpresumption of good faith\u201d \u2013 even for naked racial gerrymandering schemes. Those voter roll purges were upheld in 2018\u2019s Husted v A Philip Randolph Institute, where the court, again 5-4, created a non-existent loophole that justified canceling registrations if a voter had not casted a ballot in two consecutive elections. Then last year, Roberts authored a, yes, 5-4 decision \u2013 Common Cause v Rucho \u2013 which slammed the federal courthouses closed to partisan gerrymandering claims at precisely the time a growing number of decisions, by judges appointed by presidents of both parties, saw both an urgent role for the courts and a clear standard for when politicized mapmaking crossed a constitutional boundary.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Elected Republican officials have proven that they are willing to see Americans die rather than hold fair elections</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gerrymandering and voter purges were at the heart of the GOP urgency to hold this election, this week, with this diminished turnout. A critical state supreme court seat was on the ballot. The winner could sway an upcoming appeal over whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/06/wisconsin-voter-purges-black-student-populations-risk\">Wisconsin can purge</a> about 240,000 voters from its rolls ahead of November \u2013 keep in mind, Trump only won this state by 22,000 votes in 2016 \u2013 and could also determine whether Republicans, once again, have a free hand to gerrymander the state\u2019s legislative and congressional maps in 2021. The maps the party carefully engineered in 2011, behind closed doors at a Madison law firm, delivered a 63-36 Republican edge among state assembly districts in 2018, even though Democrats won nearly 54% of the statewide vote, and a statewide edge of about 200,000 votes.</p> <p>Non-partisan electoral reformers, Democratic congressional leadership, and even some apostate Republicans like Bill Kristol and the former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele have been battling to ensure that November\u2019s election doesn\u2019t look like the one this week in Wisconsin. After all, even if Congress does nothing to create a national vote-by-mail standard, there\u2019s still likely to be record demand for absentee ballots this fall. And just as the underfunded election administrators and US Postal Service were overwhelmed by an unprecedented 1.2m requests in Wisconsin, it\u2019s easy to imagine a creaky system collapsing under similar strains in November.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/08/wisconsin-coronavirus-black-communities-inequality\">Wisconsin's primary subjected people of color to yet another Covid-19 disadvantage | David Bowen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Republican strategy is clear: drag their feet so it\u2019s difficult to properly fund vote-by-mail.

  "<p>Recently \u2013 oh, no particular reason \u2013 I\u2019ve found myself returning to the ancient philosophical idea known as <a href=\"https://howtobeastoic.wordpress.com/2017/07/24/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-dichotomy-of-control/\" title=\"\">\u201cthe dichotomy of control\u201d</a>. \u201cSome things are within our power, while others are not,\u201d wrote <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epictetus/\" title=\"\">Epictetus</a>, the Greek Stoic, in a line you\u2019d be justified in dismissing as obvious, if it weren\u2019t for the fact that we ignore its ramifications every day, and suffer as a result. In every situation, there are things we can control and things we can\u2019t, and struggling to control the latter is a recipe for anxiety and stress. \u201cPartial control\u201d, like the kind I have over my three-year-old\u2019s behaviour, can be broken down into the two: I usually have total control over what I say or do; and none, technically, over how he reacts.</p> <p>It\u2019s an idea that\u2019s echoed widely elsewhere, for example in the <a href=\"https://www.beliefnet.com/prayers/protestant/addiction/serenity-prayer.aspx\" title=\"\">Serenity Prayer</a>, associated with Alcoholics Anonymous, and in an <a href=\"https://fakebuddhaquotes.com/if-the-problem-can-be-solved-why-worry/\" title=\"\">observation with Buddhist origins</a>: if a problem can be fixed, there\u2019s no need to worry about it; and if it can\u2019t be fixed, well, why bother worrying?</p> <p>Which is fine so far as it goes: it\u2019s surely true that <em>if</em> I could manage never to fret about things I can\u2019t affect, <em>then</em> life would proceed serenely. But it strikes me as a major weakness of Stoicism \u2013 at least in its rediscovered, newly fashionable form \u2013 to assume that seeing the truth in an insight like this can bring peace of mind by itself. Among the many things I can\u2019t control, it turns out, are my own emotions. What Sigmund Freud and his successors brought to psychology was the understanding that conscious thought might be only a tiny sliver of what\u2019s going on in the mind as a whole. So if a global pandemic triggers my particular anxieties around death, or illness, or job security \u2013 anxieties formed over decades, and embedded in my unconscious \u2013 it\u2019s radically insufficient to try to think myself into realising they\u2019re futile. If pointlessness caused things to vanish, <a href=\"https://theoutline.com/post/2987/popsockets-are-a-sin?zd=2&amp;zi=ygbznp7r\" title=\"\">Pop</a><a href=\"https://theoutline.com/post/2987/popsockets-are-a-sin?zd=2&amp;zi=ygbznp7r\" title=\"\">Sockets</a> that people stick on the backs of their phones wouldn\u2019t exist. Yet they do.</p> <p>That\u2019s why, in my experience, the dichotomy of control is best approached as a preliminary tool. You use it to distinguish what you can control from what you can\u2019t \u2013 but peace of mind arrives only when you begin taking action in the realm of the former. (As the saying goes, you can\u2019t think yourself into new ways of acting, but you can act yourself into new ways of thinking.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/13/would-a-society-of-moral-saints-be-a-worse-place-to-live\">Would a society of moral saints be a worse place to live? | Oliver Burkeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s often less a matter of realising how little control you have than how much.

Storms forecast for Augusta ensured early tee times and those three-balls as opposed to pairs.

Woods won the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/23/tiger-woods-tears-tour-championship\" title=\"\">Tour Championship at East Lake in late 2018</a>. Shortly before the Masters, Woods knocked Rory McIlroy out of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/30/tiger-woods-beats-rory-mcilroy-to-reach-wgc-dell-match-play-quarters\" title=\"\">WGC Match Play in Texas</a>. \u201cHe played very well,\u201d says McIlroy. \u201cI could see him as one of the Masters favourites on the back of what I saw there.

A 70 and a 68 had Woods one stroke from the halfway lead, held by a quintet including Scott, Molinari and Koepka. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much conversation with Tiger during those first two rounds,\u201d says Jon Rahm, one of his playing partners. \u201cBut that isn\u2019t unusual at a major.\u201d</p> <p>A Saturday pairing with Poulter led people to highlight the \u201cnew\u201d Tiger. In 2018 the duo were also third-round companions but nowhere near Masters contention. \u201cHe shot five under, I shot four under and I played great,\u201d says the Englishman. \u201cAt that point I was thinking: \u2018If I can have another day like that I might have a chance.\u2019 He was ready, he had all the shots and was pretty damn good. He had more of his game together than a year earlier, by a mile. There was a buzz out there all day Saturday. Playing with him was fun, but you could sense he was lurking.\u201d</p> <p>It felt as if 99% of the Sunday gallery \u2013 10 deep in places \u2013 were manning the 1st fairway as Woods, Molinari and Finau appeared on the tee. By midday, Woods strode to the 10th trailing the Italian by one. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt this, if I\u2019m within six of the lead starting the back nine on Sunday, I\u2019ve got a shot at it,\u201d Woods says.</p> <p>Poulter had Koepka and Webb Simpson for company in the penultimate group. Koepka\u2019s threat to Woods was obvious: the Floridian arrived at the 83rd Masters having won on two of his previous three major outings. With Molinari holding a two-stroke lead, Koepka and Woods were level at 11 under par before disaster, namely Rae\u2019s Creek, struck for the reigning US Open and US PGA champion at the 12th.</p> <p>\u201cWe were a couple behind Frankie so I think Brooks felt he had to do more and changed his line a little bit,\u201d explains Elliott. \u201cHe maybe lost a bit of patience. If he had been in the last group and seen everyone in front dunk it in the water he might have thought differently.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7fb9df2c991f7f3b618295ec863aad9e454f8912\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fb9df2c991f7f3b618295ec863aad9e454f8912/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brooks Koepka became Tiger Woods\u2019s main rival for the Masters title in a thrilling finish to the 2019 championship.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brooks Koepka became Tiger Woods\u2019s main rival for the Masters title in a thrilling finish.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Redington/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Molinari\u2019s horrid capitulation also started at Golden Bell. The Italian, who brushed Woods aside en route to Open Championship glory the previous July, shared fifth from such a commanding earlier position. \u201cHaving the Claret Jug and winning a major not long before already told me I was able to do it,\u201d Molinari says. \u201cIn some ways it made the disappointment a little bit bigger; that time I wasn\u2019t able to close it out.\u201d</p> <p>Elliott can reel off Koepka\u2019s closing stretch as if it were yesterday. \u201cEagles 13, great chance at 14 and left it short, 15 I thought he had holed it for eagle, 16 the ball just stayed above the slope ...\u201d The key, though, is that Koepka was \u201cright back in it\u201d. Woods delivered a crushing blow to all the young pretenders with a glorious for-the-ages tee shot at the par three 16th, almost resulting in a hole-in-one. The Olympic swimming legend Michael Phelps, in the gallery directly behind Woods, was among those caught in the moment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/09/sports-quiz-masters-golf-augusta\">Golf quiz: how much do you know about the Masters?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Elliott adds: \u201cWe were on the 17th tee when Tiger\u2019s shot came in. We were pin high, standing on tip toes watching it. It looked like it was going in the hole. So it\u2019s incredible to be there, in that moment even though Brooks was still in the hunt. Tiger now had a two-shot lead but that\u2019s no gimme at Augusta.</p> <p>\u201cWe were playing catch-up all day and it didn\u2019t really feel like we gave it away. In hindsight, if he had holed a couple of putts it could have been a backdoor win. We were never ahead, always behind, so we weren\u2019t kicking doors in afterwards. It was an unbelievably exciting day.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cacf77e764373cac7313782d933d130ea32bc01b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cacf77e764373cac7313782d933d130ea32bc01b/0_193_4025_2414/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patrons celebrate Tiger Woods\u2019s putt for birdie at the 16th hole in the final round of the Masters in 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patrons celebrate Tiger Woods\u2019s putt for birdie at the 16th hole in the final round of the Masters in 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Woods\u2019s playing of the last was conservative.

However, how do you even begin to replace a singer and lyricist as charismatic and gifted as the subsequently legendary 23-year-old?</p> <p>Shrewdly, they didn\u2019t try. Sumner stepped into the breach as singer, while Morris\u2019s girlfriend, Gillian Gilbert \u2013 who had already filled in for Curtis on guitar at a gig at Eric\u2019s in Liverpool after he hurt his hand \u2013 was drafted in on guitar and keyboards. This minimised the disruption to the chemistry that produced Unknown Pleasures and Closer \u2013 two of the finest albums of the post-punk era \u2013 and meant they could become a thoroughly reinvented band, albeit one that still carried Joy Division\u2019s heart and soul.</p> <p>Movement, the 1981 debut, didn\u2019t quite shake off that band\u2019s long shadow, but with Power, Corruption &amp; Lies, New Order found their sound. It\u2019s the heavenly hum of guitars and electronics, agony and ecstasy, sunlight bursting through the clouds \u2013 and one of the great pioneering albums of the 80s.</p> <p>Here, the Salford/Macclesfield quartet cast off post-punk gloom, head towards the dancefloor and embrace pop. The change is apparent from the opening song, the mighty Age of Consent, as Peter Hook\u2019s euphoric, twangy bass riff leads into a keyboard- and guitar-soaked melodrama. However, PCL is full to bursting with avenues to explore. Side one careers from the mournful We All Stand to the giddy electro-pop of The Village, a distant cousin of 1982\u2019s similarly sequencer-driven single, Temptation. 5-8-6 is electronic dancefloor pop from the same well as Blue Monday. That much-loved 80s classic isn\u2019t on the album (neither New Order nor Joy Division put singles on albums back then), but teed up PCL for a wider audience by becoming the biggest-selling 12-inch of all time.</p> <p>Side two of the album is slightly more statuesque. There\u2019s the shimmering majesty of Your Silent Face (initially titled Kraftwerk 1, in homage to the German electronic predecessors) , the tense Ultraviolence, the electro-vocoder odyssey Ecstasy and sublime, melancholy Leave Me Alone, which shows they could still make new shapes from guitars and drums. It\u2019s a record full of possible futures \u2013 for New Order and for pop \u2013 and the band\u2019s defining album is the perfect place to start.</p> <h2>The three albums to check out next</h2> <p><strong>Low-Life (1985)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3XW6NLILqo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x3XW6NLILqo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Blue Monday gave New Order a mainstream audience without entirely shedding the army of Joy Division/post-punk era fans (myself included), who wore long overcoats, pretended to read Dostoevsky, scoured record fairs for obscure bootlegs and swapped tapes of soundchecks with their mates. Low-Life (1985) carries off the tricky feat of catering for the different camps of fans. As with Power, Corruption &amp; Lies, it unveils a different style with virtually every track. Opener Love Vigilantes \u2013 about a returning soldier \u2013 is one of the band\u2019s great guitar pop songs. The Joy Division end of the band\u2019s sound is represented by the driving, post-punky Sunrise, a brooding This Time of Night and beautifully, well, elegiac Elegia, an aural memorial to Curtis that appeared years later in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LY3ftiLqmE\">an 18-minute version</a>. The newlyacquired Saturday-night-beer-monster fanbase could wobble along to Sub-Culture and Face Up.

Technique assimilates Balearic beats but is recognisably, inimitably New Order. The band\u2019s most dancefloor album starts off with the acid-house-flavoured Fine Time and ends with the supernaturally melancholy Vanishing Point, while the rest of the album careers from guitar pop (Run, Dream Attack) to plangent electronic pop (Round and Round, Mr Disco), the sound of summer adventures, Ibizan clubs and long, reflective sunsets.</p> <p><strong>Brotherhood (1986)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkOr12AQpnU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tkOr12AQpnU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Power, Corruption &amp; Lies and Low-Life defined New Order as a band who were able to weave together guitars and electronics, a format used by countless bands today. However, Brotherhood separates the two sides again, virtually entirely, with a guitar/drums side and an electronic side. Brian Eno had done something similar with the very different halves of Before and After Science, while David Bowie\u2019s \u201cHeroes\u201d divided neatly into rock music and synthesiser stuff. New Order were fans of both, and here they pull off a similar feat.</p> <p>The first side is a Hook masterclass. Having been a huge part of Joy Division\u2019s sound with those mournful/powerful bass lines, his trademark twangs fire five supremely catchy guitar-pop songs such as the hurtling Weirdo or the truly lovely As It Is When It Was. Side two kicks off with a classic \u2013 Bizarre Love Triangle\u2019s soaring symphonic electronic pop \u2013 and ends with a rare recorded moment of their idiosyncratic Mancunian humour. As Sumner sings Every Little Counts\u2019 madcap lines \u2013 \u201cI think you are a pig, you should be in a zoo\u201d \u2013 he can\u2019t stop laughing. It\u2019s a long way from their roots, but, if you like these albums, head back to Movement and Joy Division to listen to where they started out.</p> <h2>One for the heads</h2> <p><strong>Peel Session, 1982</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTlLE_UUQGM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NTlLE_UUQGM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>New Order didn\u2019t travel to Maida Vale studios in London to record their second session for John Peel\u2019s Radio 1 show \u2013 the standard practice, which they followed for their first one. But perhaps recording the four tracks in Manchester gave them room to experiment. The skeletal, minimalist, embryonic version of 5-8-6 is barely recognisable as the pop song it became later. The haunting, melancholy version of We All Stand is arguably superior to the one featuring 80s fretless bass on Power, Corruption &amp; Lies. The anxiously mournful synth- and bass-driven <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sySXyLHEM1o\">Too Late</a> is a terrific lost New Order classic, which was never played live or recorded elsewhere. The oddest curio/gem is an unlikely but sublime melodica-driven cover of Jamaican artist Keith Hudson\u2019s 1975 reggae song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYsRIdB3sc8\">Turn the Heater On</a>, which led Peel to remark: \u201cSkank with New Order.\u201d It\u2019s a wonderful remake of a song apparently loved by Ian Curtis, and this session is as fine a 20 minutes of music as New Order have recorded. It\u2019s being reissued as an EP for Record Store Day this year.</p> <h2>The primer playlist</h2> <p>For Spotify users, listen below or click on the Spotify icon in the top right of the playlist; for Apple Music users, <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/gb/playlist/listeners-digest-where-to-start-with-new-order/pl.u-xlyNNkXFkD51o9M\">click here</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4oc89LWZKZbvVVCdXav54z?si=v0kjOPPYRWSCsHQLs2Kyuw\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/4oc89LWZKZbvVVCdXav54z\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <h2>Further reading</h2> <p><strong>Substance: Inside New Order by Peter Hook (2016)<br></strong>As its title suggests, the now former New Order bassist\u2019s weighty memoir reveals all about the excess, ruckuses and recriminations behind the scenes. Some revelations about how the seminal music was created also crop up in a once top-secret cache of drink, drugs and debauchery.</p> <p><strong>Record Play Pause by Stephen Morris (2019)<br></strong>The New Order drummer\u2019s first volume of memoirs combines humour, geek-level detail and insider insight in a terrific read that\u2019s especially good on the environment and chemistry that produced Joy Division (and hence New Order). A second volume on the New Order years and fall-outs, due later this year, promises to be similarly gripping.</p> <p><strong>From Heaven to Heaven by Dec Hickey (2010)<br></strong>If you can find it, this originally limited hardback is a beautifully designed and presented pictorial and text record of New Order\u2019s early live years, 1981-84. Hickey was one of the few fans to access the then cult band at close quarters, and his eagle-eyed recollections are accompanied by input from Hook, Morris and journalist Paul Morley.</p>",
  "<p>Cambodia\u2019s national assembly has passed a state of emergency law granting the country\u2019s autocratic leader, Hun Sen, vast new powers, in what rights groups say is a cynical move to exploit the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>The legislation, passed on Friday, is expected to further weaken democratic rights in a country that has no functioning opposition and where key political opponents are either in prison or exile.</p> <p>While human rights experts agreed some restrictions were needed to slow the spread of coronavirus, it is feared that many leaders are using the emergency to grab power.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/briton-who-organised-cambodia-rescue-flight-criticises-uk-officials-coronavirus\">Briton who organised Cambodia rescue flight criticises UK officials</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Cambodia, the new legislation contains sweeping provisions allowing the government to carry out unlimited surveillance of telecommunications and to control the press and social media. The government would also gain the ability to restrict freedom of movement and assembly, seize private property and enforce quarantines.</p> <p>In addition, a catch-all clause would authorise \u201cother measures that are deemed appropriate and necessary in response to the state of emergency\u201d.</p> <p>Hun Sen initially downplayed the threat of coronavirus, and at one point threatened to throw journalists out of press conferences if they wore masks. When the Westerdam cruise ship was turned away by several other countries concerned about the outbreak, Hun Sen not only allowed the ship to dock but attracted international attention by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/16/woman-let-off-cruise-ship-in-cambodia-tests-positive-for-coronavirus\">hugging passengers as they disembarked</a>.</p> <p>The country, where a lack of media freedom means scrutiny is limited, has since recorded 115 cases of the virus.

The government does not have the ability to help.\u201d The police arrested Rithy, stating that Hun Sen\u2019s words were intended as a joke.</p> <p>Griffiths said: \u201cThe idea of concentrating even more unchecked power into the hands of this government is worrying in the extreme.\u201d</p> <p>Asean Parliamentarians for Human Rights (APHR), an association of members of parliament from south-east Asian countries, said similar laws are being used across the region to crack down on critics. </p> <p>This includes the Philippines, where individuals can be jailed for spreading false information about Covid-19, and Thailand, where an emergency decree allows the prime minister to censor publications for a broad range of reasons. Officials in Thailand also have additional powers to arrest and hold people without charge if they are suspected of having a role in causing an emergency.</p> <p>Thailand\u2019s prime minister, Prayut Chan-o-cha, and Hun Sen, \u201chave both shown in the past already creative ways to hang on to power\u201d, said Teddy Baguilat, a former Philippines MP and board member of APHR. \u201cWe need to make sure that the Covid-19 pandemic does not become their new tool to further legitimise and secure their authoritarian leadership.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The rise of Peter Navarro \u2013 the man put in charge of marshalling emergency US production of medical equipment in the midst of a pandemic \u2013 is in many ways a classic story of the Trump era.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/11/peter-navarro-the-economist-shaping-trumps-economic-thinking\">Peter Navarro: the economist shaping Trump's economic thinking</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The 70-year-old White House trade adviser was first recruited by Trump because he wrote a string of books about the Chinese strategic threat \u2013 one called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Death-China-Confronting-Dragon-paperback/dp/0134319036\">Death by China</a> \u2013 despite having spent almost no time in the country and having no grasp of the language.</p> <p>Five of Navarro\u2019s books cited a China hand with a particularly pithy turn of phrase called Ron Vara, who turned out not to exist. The name is an anagram of Navarro and the imaginary expert operated as an alter ego, confirming the author\u2019s views.</p> <p>Navarro made headlines in the past week by challenging Dr Anthony Fauci \u2013 the nation\u2019s leading immunologist and the public face of the US scientific community\u2019s race to contain Covid-19 \u2013 in a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine-white-house-01306286-0bbc-4042-9bfe-890413c6220d.html\">showdown</a> in the White House situation room over the merits of an experimental drug.</p> <p>When asked later why he thought he was qualified to start recommending pharmaceuticals to the nation, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/06/politics/peter-navarro-social-scientist-cnntv/index.html\">Navarro replied</a>: \u201cMy qualifications in terms of looking at the science is that I\u2019m a social scientist. I have a PhD. And I understand how to read statistical studies, whether it\u2019s in medicine, the law, economics or whatever.\u201d</p> <p>People who have worked closely with Navarro agree he is undoubtedly bright. He holds a PhD in economics from Harvard. But there is nothing in his career to date that suggests he has the credentials or experience to manage the state intervention necessary to steer US industry towards producing the masks, gowns, ventilators and other life-saving supplies the country will need over the course of this pandemic.</p> <p>Before coming to the White House, Navarro was a west coast academic economist with views on trade far outside the American mainstream and a failed political career behind him, have lost five elections and won none in his adoptive home town of San Diego.</p> <p>His former campaign adviser, Larry Remer, said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t trust him to go out to get lunch and come back with everybody\u2019s sandwich and drink order correctly. I don\u2019t know how he could be put in charge of logistics.</p> <p>\u201cOn one level it\u2019s amusing but on another level, it\u2019s really dangerous,\u201d added Remer, a San Diego political consultant.</p> <p>Navarro\u2019s appearance in the Trump camp during the 2016 presidential campaign came as a shock to those who knew him from his days in San Diego politics. He had started out as a registered Republican but became an anti-growth, environmentalist independent, then a Democratic candidate for Congress in 1996, promoted energetically but unsuccessfully by Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Navarro came closest to victory in 1992 when he emerged as the surprise contender to be San Diego mayor, taking on the city\u2019s entrenched Republican establishment. He stood as an independent, with a working-class background, determined to stand up for the little guy in the face of rampant development. He called his movement Plan (Prevent Los Angelization Now) and he appeared to have a good chance of winning going into a final television debate a couple of days before the vote.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"638003cb287f3fda0c4ffcbbce46f6bc1d502960\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/638003cb287f3fda0c4ffcbbce46f6bc1d502960/0_122_3648_2189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Navarro walks past reporters on the driveway outside the West Wing of the White House in Washington, DC, USA, 26 March 2020.

  "<p>One of the things I\u2019ve spotted on Twitter recently is people confessing to being chocolate bingers. That includes the glorious <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nigella_Lawson/status/1241465218108133378\">Nigella</a>, who still inexplicably manages to keep her Gina Lollobrigida-like figure. All I can deduce from that is we are all craving a little sweetness in our lives right now, and wine, of course, can tick that box, too.</p> <p>I may be wrong about this \u2013 it\u2019s hard to predict <em>anything</em> reliably at the moment \u2013 but I don\u2019t anticipate there will be a run on sweet sherry or port any time soon (if there were, the producers would be ecstatic: they\u2019ve been trying to reverse falling sales for decades).</p> <p>At this time of year, I prefer lighter wines such as sauternes and other late-harvest sauvignon blancs, especially if any early-season strawberries have made it to the shelves. They also go with other fruits such as peaches and apricots, for which it is still early, or with almost any kind of classic apple or pear tart. They work less well with lemon-based desserts, which have the effect of throwing many sweet wines out of kilter, though late-harvest riesling \u2013 which matches lemon for acidity \u2013 is the exception that proves the rule. Meringue-based desserts such as pavlovas also need a light wine, rather than a dark, sticky one. Though you should turn to the latter if you\u2019re having something like a dense, squidgy, chocolate cake. That\u2019s if you haven\u2019t run through your chocolate stash, obviously.</p> <p>Then there are sweet or semi-sweet sparkling wines such as moscato d\u2019Asti and, you may be surprised to hear, \u201cextra-dry\u201d prosecco, which, perversely, can contain up to 17g of residual sugar ( left over after fermentation). By comparison, \u201cbrut\u201d proseccos have in the region of 10-12g sugar, which still makes them a bit sweeter than most champagnes and, to my mind, makes them go better with sweet foods, such as cake and biscuits, than savoury ones.</p> <p>And I can\u2019t help but feel that even if you don\u2019t normally touch the stuff, now is the moment for Bailey\u2019s or \u2013 better still \u2013 an own-label equivalent, not least because it will probably be half, if not a third, of the price.

  "<p>I would never have described myself as vain. When I got my first standup spot on television, I returned home to find my wife and mother waiting to stage a hair intervention, immediately taking me to get it cut. I had apparently left it so long that my wife described my look as \u201crecently released political prisoner\u201d. Similarly with clothes: once we had children, I discovered that anything nice had a life expectancy of about an hour before one of them smeared ketchup, snot or a concoction that could only be identified by sending it to a lab, all over it, sometimes accidentally. So, for a long while, I just gave up on wearing nice stuff.</p> <p>Since then, I have started to get my hair cut more frequently and make a sartorial effort. My wife would argue that I have gone too far the other way, as it is fair to say I have developed something of a trainer addiction. I recently wore a box-fresh pair of Yeezys to Chessington World of Adventures, which my wife and kids insisted would lead to the day being ruined by me crying over getting any kind of mark on them. Yeezys are the only fashion item I have ever possessed where, before deciding whether to wear them or not, I have to check the news to see if the designer, Kanye West, has said something twattish.</p> <p>But I ignored my family\u2019s protests. What\u2019s the point of getting nice things if you\u2019re not going to wear them? Half an hour after arriving, a woman in a wheelchair ran over my foot, emblazoning my trainers with a tyre mark, and my family said, \u201cI told you so\u201d a combined total of 1,500 times.</p> <p>What the lockdown has shown me, apart from the importance of not reading the news just before bed, is that I never really left the slob in me behind. Freshly trimmed and smart-clothing Romesh is my Bruce-Banner, and the pants-dwelling, hairy, unkempt, eating-like-an-animal-about-to-go-into-hibernation Romesh has been biding his time until a global pandemic would allow him to re-emerge: the Disgusting Hulk.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/13/nickname-ashy-ankles-fight-back-with-moisturiser-romesh-ranganathan\">No one wants the nickname Ashy Ankles. I\u2019m fighting back with moisturiser | Romesh Ranganathan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Obviously, I haven\u2019t had a haircut for ages, but I also haven\u2019t shaved since all this started. At first, I would wear tracksuits and comfy hoodies; nice loungewear that, at a push, you might pop to the shops in. Those were the halcyon days. Since then, I have stopped giving any kind of thought to what the outfit looks like, merely ensuring I make some sort of effort to cover my genitals. I have started wearing whatever comes to hand. I type this while wearing a very smart shirt, Gruffalo slippers and boxer briefs. This morning, I walked downstairs in this outfit as if my mission brief was to stop my wife ever having a feeling of sexual desire for me again.</p> <p>Everyone I know has been talking about how they are going to head straight out and aggressively socialise as soon as this is over. I would actively campaign, however, for an extra week or so of lockdown for people to adjust to doing their hair, picking out clothes that are suitable for public consumption, and dressing in a way that won\u2019t lead to arrest. If we don\u2019t have that time allocated, I fear that, for a while, we are going to see people at bars and in shops wearing swimwear and dressing gowns. If that does happen, I will be doing my very best to make shirts, slippers and boxer shorts a thing.</p>",
  "<p>William Barr has said without evidence that he believes the Russia investigation that shadowed Donald Trump for the first two years of his administration was started without any basis and amounted to an effort to \u201csabotage the presidency\u201d, he said in an interview with Fox News Channel that aired on Thursday.</p> <p>The attorney general offered no support for his assertion that the FBI lacked a basis for opening the investigation and made no mention of the fact that the bureau began its investigation after a Trump campaign adviser purported to have early knowledge that Russia had dirt on his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Barr, who has appointed a US attorney to scrutinize the origins of the Russia investigation, said the justice department has evidence there was \u201csomething far more troubling\u201d than just mistakes during the investigation that was eventually taken over by special counsel Robert Mueller.</p> <p>\u201cI think the president has every right to be frustrated, because I think what happened to him was one of the greatest travesties in American history,\u201d Barr said in the interview with Fox News Channel\u2019s Laura Ingraham.</p> <p>The attorney general asserted that the FBI launched its counterintelligence investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia \u201cwithout any basis\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEven more concerning, actually, is what happened after the campaign, a whole pattern of events while he was president,\u201d Barr said. \u201cTo sabotage the presidency, and I think that \u2013 or at least have the effect of sabotaging the presidency.\u201d</p> <p>The justice department\u2019s inspector general found in a December report that the FBI <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/09/fbi-trump-russia-investigation-ig-report\">was justified in opening the investigation</a> to protect against a potential national security threat. It did not find any evidence that the decision to start the investigation was motivated by political bias.</p> <p>Barr has faced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/16/donald-trump-justice-two-tier-kellyanne-conway\">previous calls to step down</a> after he was accused of politicizing the position of attorney general, \u201cdoing the president\u2019s personal bidding\u201d and damaging the reputation of the department for \u201cintegrity and the rule of law\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/09/fbi-trump-russia-investigation-ig-report\">FBI's Trump-Russia inquiry wasn't biased against president, watchdog finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump and his supporters are counting on different conclusions from the investigation led by John Durham, the US attorney Barr selected to examine the early days of the Russia investigation. Durham\u2019s investigation is ongoing, and Barr did not provide any evidence about what Durham has found so far.</p> <p>Mueller concluded that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 election, but his investigation didn\u2019t find sufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia. Mueller also examined about a dozen possible instances of obstruction of justice and has pointedly said he could not exonerate the president.</p> <p>The inspector general\u2019s report identified significant problems with applications for warrants to monitor the communications of former Trump campaign aide Carter Page in 2016 and 2017. Investigators were concerned about Page\u2019s ties to Russia, but never charged him with any wrongdoing.</p> <p>The inspector general, Michael Horowitz, has said the FBI failed to follow its own standards for accuracy and completeness in wiretap applications provided to the secretive foreign intelligence surveillance court.</p> <p>The report detailed 17 errors and omissions in the application process, including failing to tell the court when questions were raised about the reliability of some of the information it had presented to receive the warrants. Those mistakes prompted internal changes within the FBI and spurred a congressional debate over whether the bureau\u2019s surveillance tools should be reined in.</p> <p>But Barr said he believes they were more than just mistakes, offering a personal view of the investigation, a highly unusual move for a prosecutor during an ongoing investigation.</p> <p>\u201cMy own view is that the evidence shows that we\u2019re not dealing with just mistakes or sloppiness,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is something far more troubling here, and we\u2019re going to get to the bottom of it.</p> <p>The FBI began investigating on 31 July 2016 whether the Trump campaign was conspiring with Russia to sway the outcome of the presidential election.</p> <p>By that point, Russian hackers had broken into the Clinton campaign and other Democratic email accounts and George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign adviser, had boasted to a diplomat that he was aware that Russia had derogatory information on Clinton.</p> <p>Though Trump and Barr have seized on errors made during the surveillance of Page, the investigation had already been under way for months by the time the first application was filed.</p> <p><em>Associated Press contributed to this report.</em></p>",
  "<p>As Italy struggles to pull its economy through the coronavirus crisis, the Mafia is gaining local support by distributing free food to poor families in quarantine who have run out of cash, authorities have warned.</p> <p>In recent weeks, videos have surfaced of known Mafia gangs delivering essential goods to Italians hit hard by the coronavirus emergency across the poorest southern regions of Campania, Calabria, Sicily and Puglia, as tensions rise across the country.</p> <p>\u201cFor over a month, shops, caf\u00e9s, restaurants and pubs have been closed,\u201d Nicola Gratteri, antimafia investigator and head of the prosecutor\u2019s office in Catanzaro, told the Guardian. \u201cMillions of people work in the grey economy, which means that they haven\u2019t received any income in more than a month and have no idea when they might return to work. The government is issuing so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/italy-sets-aside-400m-for-food-vouchers-as-social-unrest-mounts\">shopping vouchers</a> to support people. If the state doesn\u2019t step in soon to help these families, the mafia will provide its services, imposing their control over people\u2019s lives.\u201d</p> <p>The ramifications of the lockdown in Italy are affecting the estimated 3.3 million people in Italy who work off the books. Of those, more than 1 million live in the south, according to the most recent figures from CGIA Mestre, a Venice-based small business association. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/singing-stops-italy-fear-social-unrest-mount-coronavirus-lockdown\">There have been reports of small shop owners being pressured to give food for free</a>, while police are patrolling supermarkets in some areas to stop thefts. Videos of people in Sicily protesting against the government\u2019s stalled response, or <a href=\"https://tv.iltempo.it/home-tv/2020/03/27/video/coronavirus-bari-commerciante-senza-soldi-cibo-banca-video-polizia-1303253/\">people beating their fists outside banks in Bari for a \u20ac50 (\u00a344) loan</a> are going viral and throwing fuel on the crisis; a fire the mafia is more than willing to stoke.</p> <p>From the first signals of mounting social unrest, the Italian minister of the interior, Luciana Lamorgese, said \u2018\u2018the mafia could take advantage of the rising poverty, swooping in to recruit people to its organisation\u2019\u2019. Or simply stepping in to distribute free food parcels of pasta, water, flour and milk.</p> <p>In recent days, the police in Naples have intensified their presence in the poorest quarters of the city, where <a href=\"https://napoli.fanpage.it/spese-domicilio-camorra-napoli/\">men tied to the Camorra, the Neapolitan mafia, have organi</a><a href=\"https://napoli.fanpage.it/spese-domicilio-camorra-napoli/\">sed home delivery of food parcels</a>. Magistrates have already begun an investigation against a group of people who were questioned while distributing food to local residents.</p> <p>In Palermo, <a href=\"https://rep.repubblica.it/pwa/locali/2020/04/08/news/palermo_il_fratello_del_boss_della_droga_fa_la_spesa_per_lo_zen-253439286/\">according to La Repubblica</a>, the brother of a Cosa Nostra boss allegedly distributed food to the poor in the Zen neighbourhood, an area with an established mafia presence.

Commentators often focus on the financial aspect of mafias but they tend to forget that their strength comes from having a local base from which to operate.\u201d</p> <p>The question of distributing food parcels is a tactic as old as the mafia itself, where in the south of Italy bosses have customarily presented themselves to the people as benefactors and local power brokers, initially without asking for anything in return. </p> <p>\u201cMafia bosses consider their cities as their own fiefdom,\u201d Gratteri said. \u201cThe bosses know very well that in order to govern, they need to take care of the people in their territory. And they do it by exploiting the situation to their advantage. In the people\u2019s eyes, a boss who knocks on the door offering free food is a hero. And the boss knows that he can then count on the support of these families when necessary, when, for example, the mafia sponsors a politician for election who will further their criminal interests.\u201d</p> <p>Dozens of investigations in the south have led to the arrests of politicians who have aided and abetted the mafia, and who were elected with the support of local Mafiosi who forced citizens to vote for them in exchange for services, such as a simple food parcel.</p> <p>Varese said: \u201cThese handouts by the mafias are not gifts. The mafia does not do anything out of its kind heart. They are favours that everyone will have to pay back in some form or another, by aiding and abetting a fugitive, holding a gun, dealing drugs and the like.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cConsider what happened to El Chapo, the Mexican narco,\u201d said Gratteri. \u201cHe trafficked tons of cocaine and commissioned the murder of hundreds of people but in his hometown he was known for his benevolence, because people said that he provided medicines to families or built roads. The same thing happens here.\u201d</p> <p>This week, <a href=\"https://rep.repubblica.it/pwa/intervista/2020/04/06/news/cafiero_de_raho_i_clan_sfrutteranno_l_emergenza_per_mangiarsi_l_economia_-253334622/\">Itay\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://rep.repubblica.it/pwa/intervista/2020/04/06/news/cafiero_de_raho_i_clan_sfrutteranno_l_emergenza_per_mangiarsi_l_economia_-253334622/\">antimafia </a><a href=\"https://rep.repubblica.it/pwa/intervista/2020/04/06/news/cafiero_de_raho_i_clan_sfrutteranno_l_emergenza_per_mangiarsi_l_economia_-253334622/\">prosecutor\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://rep.repubblica.it/pwa/intervista/2020/04/06/news/cafiero_de_raho_i_clan_sfrutteranno_l_emergenza_per_mangiarsi_l_economia_-253334622/\">office </a><a href=\"https://rep.repubblica.it/pwa/intervista/2020/04/06/news/cafiero_de_raho_i_clan_sfrutteranno_l_emergenza_per_mangiarsi_l_economia_-253334622/\">said bosses would offer their virtually endless criminal capital to businesses in need</a>, and then swallow them up. Then, they will use those businesses for money laundering profits from the criminal activities.</p> <p>Varese said: \u201cThe mafias might be able to benefit in other ways from the current lockdown and especially from the future, when Italians will all be able to return to work, spend more money, and get the economy on its feet again. But surely the story exemplified by the handouts of food parcels in Palermo and Naples shows their true nature, and it tells why they are so dangerous.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Welcome to our weekly roundup of developments in the coronavirus pandemic that continues to spread around the world. As the outbreak <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-100-days-that-changed-the-world\">passed the 100-day mark</a> and many countries extended their lockdowns, others moved to relax restrictions wary that cases may take off again.</p> \n<h2><strong>Scientists shed light on </strong><strong>immune response to coronavirus</strong></h2> \n<p>On Monday, a team at Fudan University in Shanghai <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047365v1\">reported the first detailed analysis</a> of the immune response in patients with coronavirus. Tests on the blood of 175 patients who had been discharged from hospitals in Shanghai revealed that neutralising antibodies \u2013 those that can wipe out the virus \u2013 usually arose 10 to 15 days after the onset of illness and targeted three different parts of the \u201cspike\u201d protein on the virus\u2019s surface.</p> \n<p>While older patients produced the highest levels of neutralising antibodies, many patients had low levels and 10 did not appear to generate them at all. If the findings hold up \u2013 the study has yet to be reviewed and published \u2013 they have widespread implications. The more robust immune response from older people suggests their blood plasma may work best in trials that are assessing whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-survivors-blood-plasma-could-be-used-to-fight-infection\">convalescent plasma</a> infusions can help seriously ill patients overcome the virus. But the findings may frustrate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/08/health-minister-defends-uk-coronavirus-testing-approach-chris-whitty-germany-covid-19\">efforts to manufacture an accurate antibody test</a> for the virus if many people have low or even non-existent levels of neutralising antibodies. This week it emerged that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/uk-government-urged-to-abandon-poor-finger-prick-antibody-tests-coronavirus\">none of the antibody tests</a> purchased by the UK government were good enough to roll out.</p> \n<p>The work also has implications for<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/immunity-passports-could-speed-up-return-to-work-after-covid-19\"> \u201cimmunity passports\u201d</a>, which could allow people to return to normal life if blood tests showed they had developed immunity to the virus. Nearly 6% of the recovered patients had no neutralising antibodies, suggesting that other parts of the immune system had cleared the infection, without producing long-term immunity.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ba9786c6-c779-4063-8bf9-1d3009eb7c70\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3qV7R2iYVXg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Not everyone agrees on wearing face masks</strong></h2> \n<p>Whether or not to don a face mask in public became a matter of debate and confusion. After a <a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak\">review of new evidence</a>, the World Health Organization maintained its view on Monday that while people who have cough, fever and difficulty breathing should wear a mask and seek medical help, there was no need for healthy people to wear face masks in public. The organisation conceded that people without symptoms can spread the virus, but only recommended healthy people wear face masks when they were caring for a coronavirus patient and in the same room. The masks can help prevent infections by catching large virus-laden droplets that are expelled from patients when they cough and sneeze, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/face-masks-coronavirus-scientists-evidence-covid-19-public\">David Heymann</a>, who chairs the WHO\u2019s risk committee, said face masks can give people a false sense of security if they do not combine an effective one with eye protection and adopt strict hand hygiene measures.</p> \n<p>The UK has a similar stance to the WHO and does not recommend healthy people wear masks in public. But the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) not only <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html\">advises people to wear face masks</a> outside, but offers guidance on how to make \u201ccloth face coverings\u201d too. On Tuesday, US government scientists argued the case for face coverings after <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20051177v1\">preliminary research</a> showed people spray out thousands of tiny saliva droplets when they speak simple sentences such as \u201cstay healthy\u201d. Adriaan Bax at the US National Institutes of Health, who led the work, found a damp homemade cloth face mask \u201cdramatically reduced droplet excretion\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a81dbd86-f7c7-4b2d-affa-9a6aff9b9b5f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4xFY3aPF7E4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Some countries look towards easing </strong><strong>lockdowns</strong></h2> \n<p>Following in the footsteps of China, a number of countries announced plans to relax restrictions they had put in place to stop the spread of the virus. On Wednesday, China, lifted its 11-week lockdown in Wuhan where the outbreak began. The following day, the Czech Republic allowed bicycle shops and DIY, hobby and hardware stores to reopen. After the Easter break, Austria will let small shops, DIY stores and garden centres return to business, while Denmark plans to reopen kindergartens and primary schools. But with the virus still present and large numbers of people still vulnerable to infection, health officials are watching closely for cases to surge again. As Denmark\u2019s prime minister, Metter Frederiksen, commented: \u201cIt\u2019s like walking a tightrope.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/apr/08/wuhan-ends-coronavirus-lockdown-in-pictures\">Wuhan ends coronavirus lockdown \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, was admitted to intensive care for several days but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/09/boris-johnson-moved-from-intensive-care-but-stays-in-hospital\">returned to a ward on Thursday</a> after he improved without needing mechanical ventilation.

President Trump imposed restrictions on travellers from China at the end of January but only blocked travel from most European countries in mid-March. Separate teams at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City and New York University reached similar conclusions after studying the genetic code of viruses obtained from patients in the region. The scientists traced the origins of the outbreak by analysing patterns of mutations that accumulate in viruses as they spread. \u201cThe majority is clearly European,\u201d Harm van Bakel, a geneticist from one of the teams, told the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/science/new-york-coronavirus-cases-europe-genomes.html\">New York Times</a>.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Huanan seafood wholesale market in central Wuhan was the kind of place where people often caught colds. Vendors started setting up as early as 3am, plunging their hands into buckets of cold water as they cleaned and prepared produce for the customers that arrived every morning.</p> \n<p>The sprawling market of more than 20 streets spanned two sides of a main road in an upscale neighbourhood of the commercial district of Hankou. Racks of meat were hung on hooks or spilled out on plastic mats. Workers walked around in welly boots. Drains lined the kerb alongside stores selling everything from live poultry to seafood and cooking ingredients. It was crowded but clean.</p> \n<p>So, in mid-December when Lan, who sold dried seafood at one of more than 1,000 stalls in Huanan, felt unwell, he thought little of it.</p> \n<p>He stayed home to rest but after losing 3kg in just a few days, he decided to go to his regular hospital for a check up.</p> \n<p>From there he was sent to a hospital that specialises in infectious diseases and was admitted on 19 December. He remembers how the staff praised his positive attitude. \u201cI was just a little bit sick. I wasn\u2019t scared in the slightest,\u201d said Lan, who asked not to disclose his full name.</p> \n<p>Lan could not have known then that he was among the first cases of a new, highly contagious coronavirus that would kill more than 2,500 people in his city and engulf the world, infecting more than 1.6 million people so far and killing more than 95,000. The World Health Organization has described the outbreak of Covid-19 as the worst global crisis since the second world war. \u201cI thought I had a cold. I had no idea,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Coronavirus infections began cropping up in Wuhan in December \u2013 and reportedly as early as November \u2013 but the Chinese authorities did not inform the public that the virus could pass between humans until late January.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fd795549d1b5491e10309e81a06529ed201b241\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fd795549d1b5491e10309e81a06529ed201b241/0_364_5461_3277/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A makeshift Intensive care unit in February at the Red Cross hospital in Wuhan where many patients were in critical condition.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A makeshift Intensive care unit in February at the Red Cross hospital in Wuhan where many patients were in critical condition.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerry Yin/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Now, as China celebrates what it claims is victory over the disease, the number of infections and deaths is increasing around the world. Officials from Australia, the US and the UK have accused Beijing of suppressing information, allowing a localised outbreak to turn into a pandemic.</p> \n<p>Beijing claims its strict lockdowns bought the world time that health authorities in some countries chose to squander. But interviews with early patients, medical workers and residents, as well as leaked internal documents, accounts from whistleblowers and research studies, show delays in the first few weeks of the epidemic, government missteps that would have far-reaching consequences.</p> \n<h2>Human-to-human transmission</h2> \n<p>By the end of December, before Lan recovered after more than 20 days in hospital, word had gotten out in Wuhan about a mystery illness. Internet users circulated screenshots of a WeChat conversation on 30 December in which a doctor at Wuhan Red Cross hospital, Liu Wen, warned colleagues of confirmed cases of a contagious coronavirus at another hospital. \u201cWash your hands! Face masks! Gloves!\u201d the medic wrote.</p> \n<p>That same day an ophthalmologist at Wuhan central hospital named Li Wenliang told a WeChat group of former medical school classmates that seven people at his hospital had contracted what he believed to be Sars, the outbreak that killed more than 600 people in mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-03.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4b9a4d99440e0245e3f84c80701a4751bfea7b1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4b9a4d99440e0245e3f84c80701a4751bfea7b1/0_24_5745_3447/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A makeshift intensive care unit at the Red Cross hospital in Wuhan in mid-February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An intensive care unit at the Red Cross hospital in Wuhan in mid-February.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerry Yin/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>An \u201curgent notice\u201d from the Wuhan health commission warning of \u201csuccessive cases of unknown pneumonia\u201d was also leaked and posted online on 30 December. The statement ordered hospitals to \u201cstrengthen responsible leadership\u201d and ensure that no one \u201cdisclose information to the public without authorisation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Under growing pressure, the following day the health commission said researchers were investigating 27 cases of viral pneumonia, its first official notice about the virus. There was no \u201cobvious evidence of human-to-human transmission,\u201d the statement said, describing the outbreak as linked to the seafood market and assuring the public that all patients had been quarantined and their contacts placed under observation. \u201cThe disease is preventable and controllable,\u201d it added.</p> \n<p>A day later, on 1 January, the Huanan seafood market was closed and Wuhan\u2019s public security bureau announced that eight people had been \u201cpunished\u201d for spreading rumours. Authorities also tasked hospitals to screen for pneumonia cases linked to the market. It wasn\u2019t until 20 January that vendors in the market were asked to submit to temperature checks and blood tests.</p> \n<p>But across the Yangtze River, some 6 miles (10km) away, people who had never been to the market were falling sick.

A young woman in line in front of them fainted and Han\u2019s mother hugged her, telling Han not to look.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe all knew we might have the virus. Everyone was scared,\u201d Han said. \u201cI think the doctors knew it was transmissible between humans or they wouldn\u2019t have sat so far from us and kept the windows open.\u201d</p> \n<p>While Han was told that she probably had \u201cthat pneumonia\u201d, she was not able to confirm the diagnosis because the hospital was not authorised to do so, an issue many early patients faced. She was told to go home and self-quarantine but the doctors prescribed her medicine that she had to renew every three days at the hospital, waiting in line with others.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was extremely worried I was passing it to others, but I couldn\u2019t let my parents go somewhere so dangerous,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Daron Hu, 35, who also had never been to the Huanan seafood market, began to feel feverish and dizzy on 16 January. He thought he was just hungover after a few drinks the previous night. Three days later, still unwell, he took a train to Jiangsu province for a work trip. He travelled back to Wuhan and from there returned to his hometown a few hours to the south.</p> \n<p>By the time Hu was admitted into his local hospital, a team of researchers sent by the central government had arrived in Wuhan. Zhong Nanshan, a top respiratory expert famous for countering the government narrative on Sars, said on the evening of 20 January that there had already been cases of human-to-human transmission.</p> \n<p>Hu, who at his worst point suffered diarrhoea and breathing troubles in addition to a fever and a cough, told his family that he was fine. But over the next 24 days in the hospital, at least three other patients died. He considered writing a will. \u201cI saw some people give up. It is very lonely,\u201d Hu said.</p> \n<h2>\u2018Things felt out of control\u2019</h2> \n<p>By the time officials revealed the infectiousness of the virus, hospitals in Wuhan were already overwhelmed and the numbers increased after the announcement. Video taken on 22 and 23 January showed crowds of patients at Wuhan No 6 hospital in Wuchang, another district of Wuhan.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was so busy. We couldn\u2019t go home,\u201d said a nurse who slept in the hospital dormitory and rotated every four hours in a team of six people to keep up.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0898893b6f12be2eca08bde792271cd834fecec\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0898893b6f12be2eca08bde792271cd834fecec/0_284_5301_3181/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On 28 March 28 the subway in Wuhan resumed operation after two months of being closed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On 28 March 28 the subway in Wuhan resumed operation after two months of being closed.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerry Yin/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Another medic gestured to the sidewalk outside the hospital. \u201cThis was all full,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery day people were dying.\u201d</p> \n<p>On 23 January, the city of 11 million people was placed under lockdown. Surrounding areas followed suit, putting a total of more than 50 million people under de-facto home quarantine.</p> \n<p>Facing severe shortages of supplies, staff and space, the next few weeks were desperate. Hospitals turned away patients, sending them home where they often infected their families. Footage showed medics weeping and people collapsed in the streets. Dead bodies were left in hospitals where staff were too busy to collect them. Internet forums filled with pages of pleas for help by residents trying to save loved ones. By 19 February, the death toll from the virus had passed 2,000.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe virus was very quick. At the beginning, things felt out of control. We didn\u2019t know what would happen,\u201d said one doctor treating coronavirus patients at Wuhan central hospital, who asked not to be named because he was not given permission to speak to media.</p> \n<p>It is a time authorities are quick to gloss over as they celebrate the lifting of Wuhan\u2019s almost three-month lockdown, an event marked with light shows and banners hailing the success of the \u201cpeople\u2019s war\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cBeijing has been working very hard to fight the negative domestic and international fallout,\u201d said Ho-Fung Hung, a professor in political economy at Johns Hopkins University.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut this is far from adequate in stopping people from discussing China\u2019s responsibility in covering up the outbreak in the beginning,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0e9d4a87c1b650d7c95769860343e77038227e3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0e9d4a87c1b650d7c95769860343e77038227e3/0_81_5473_3284/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On 8 April the Wuhan Gongjialing toll station reopens as authorities lift traffic restrictions after 76 days of lockdown in which residents were not allowed to leave the city.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On 8 April the Wuhan Gongjialing toll station reopens as authorities lift traffic restrictions after 76 days of lockdown in which residents were not allowed to leave the city.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerry Yin/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Wuhan is slowly coming back to life. Neighbourhoods have erected flags and signs declaring them \u201cvirus free\u201d. Cars are starting to fill the streets again as people return to work. Yet, visible reminders of the epidemic remain. Rows of tall metal fencing surround the still-shuttered Huanan seafood market, its former entrances manned by security while police cars patrol nearby.<strong> </strong></p> \n<p>And not everyone is willing to forget. On a wall near her home, Han recently spray-painted the Chinese characters<em> bu neng, bu mingbai</em> (I cannot, I do not understand), a reference to a declaration Li Wenliang, the whistleblower doctor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/07/coronavirus-chinese-rage-death-whistleblower-doctor-li-wenliang\">was forced to sign</a> before eventually succumbing to the virus he tried to warn others about. Underneath the words, some residents have burned piles of paper money, a way to honour the dead, drawing small white circles around the ashes.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey said stay. I stayed. They said everything was fine. I believed. I believed it all,\u201d Han says. \u201cI want to know why this happened. Who said not to tell people?\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cI will remember this for the rest of my life \u2013 I understand now that we are not important.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Additional reporting by Lillian Yang and Jiahui Huang</em></p>",

  "<p>Sunbathing in the park, normally the most innocent of pleasures, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/uk-sunbathers-stricter-coronavirus-lockdowns\">causing outrage</a>. The police are involved; the parks may be shut.</p> \n<p>Lockdown is never easy, but when the weather is good, the urge to be outside, to feel the sun on your face, to lie on the grass, under a tree, is almost irresistible. To close your eyes and pretend just for a little while that life is normal. How can this be wrong?</p> \n<p>Extreme libertarians think it is not. They say that freedom is so important that losing it is worse than death (other people\u2019s deaths, at any rate). Most of us don\u2019t agree. We accept the need for social distancing. But even so, the lockdown rules don\u2019t require us to stay in all the time. There are exceptions. Why not just one more, just for me, my family, our suntan cream and picnic basket? If my local park is empty, my family and I can enjoy our picnic <em> </em>in the open air. We refresh ourselves and don\u2019t harm anyone else \u2013 they chose to stay at home anyway. What could possibly be wrong with that?</p> \n<p>Moral and political philosophers have long struggled with the conflict between individual choice and the common good, between general rules and exceptions, and have come to very different conclusions about the right answer.</p> \n<p>It is plainly rational, game theorists say, to make some people better off (me and my family) and no one worse off (everyone else). Some moral philosophers have thought it morally right too. According to utilitarians, rules are made to be broken, when you make people happier by breaking them. Our fundamental moral duty, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/03/john-stuart-mill-on-liberty-100-best-nonfiction-books-review-robert-mccrum\">John Stuart Mill</a> said, is to produce the greatest happiness of the greatest number. In the time of coronavirus, that means staying away from other people.</p> \n<p>But if you can do that while making yourself happier \u2013 by sunbathing or picnicking, because everyone else has obeyed the lockdown \u2013 it is not just permitted but actually morally right to go for it. Of course, seeing my family reclining outdoors may send onlookers into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/lockdown-viral-trends-5g-towers-coronavirus-cases\">righteous fury</a>, reducing the total happiness (though righteous fury can be pretty enjoyable too). Also we may inspire others to break the rules themselves, and if everyone thinks this way, the park will be full. That is dangerous for us all and it would be better to stay at home. But all this means is that I ought to be discreet. If I am, no harm, no wrong.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3849e921-99ee-4b30-87d9-ad45ffd298fb\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tVoHlEfXtJ0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Can that really be true? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2013/sep/20/west-kantian-ideal-freedom-society-suffers\">Immanuel Kant</a> thought the fundamental moral question was a different one: what if everyone did that? Kant thought it was right to act only in ways that could be a universal law. We know that if everyone picnicked in the park, no one could do so safely. When I do it anyway, I am acting in a way that could not be for everyone. I am relying on everyone else abiding by the rules, exploiting their conformity to benefit myself. I am treating myself as an exception, a special case. This is not a way of treating other people with respect. This is not fair.</p> \n<p>If we accept that morality is not only a matter of harm and benefit, but also respect and fairness, we can see what is wrong with picnicking in the park at the present time. But once we start to think in these terms, we need to look at a much broader picture. As political philosophers such as Karl Marx emphasise, our individual decisions are made against a social background that we have not chosen. Lockdown is a very different experience for different people, depending on their personality, their family circumstances and their living conditions. It is easier to stay at home in a large, roomy house with a pleasant garden than in a cramped high-rise flat with no outdoor space.</p> \n<p>Lockdown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-inequality-managers-zoom-cleaners-offices\">reinforces existing social inequalities</a>. It is even less excusable for the more fortunate to break the rules. Though we should all keep to the guidelines, it doesn\u2019t follow that we should heap blame on those who don\u2019t, not knowing what staying at home is like for them, not knowing their reasons for being out. Of course they should comply, but be kind; most people are doing their best.</p> \n<p>It is a mark of the crisis we are in that simply sunbathing in the park raises the deepest questions about what truly matters in our lives: the happiness of all, even if I rely on others obeying the rules, as utilitarians would say. Or respect and fairness, as Kant would reply. The role of individual responsibility within a social context, as Marx would insist.</p> \n<p>Finally, we can draw on another value very important to Marx (and Rousseau and Hegel too): the value of solidarity. There are huge disparities between the burdens a few are being asked to bear for the sake of the many. Doctors, nurses and other key workers constantly risk their lives to look after the sick and to keep essential services running. For the rest of us, there is very little that we can do to make a difference in this global crisis. It is easy to feel helpless and overwhelmed. But in fact, sitting at home, we can stand in solidarity with those who are doing more. We are doing our part, and treating fairly everyone else who is doing the same. It is the most, and the least, we can do.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Alison Hills is a fellow and tutor in philosophy at St John\u2019s College, University of Oxford</p> \n<p><br><br></p>",
  "<p>The pizza place was the first to react.</p> <p>Within hours of the announcement that schools in my small Ohio community would close for at least three weeks, the restaurant began making baguette sandwiches, free for all children. Next, the inn announced they would distribute peanut butter and jelly every day, no purchase necessary and no questions asked.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/06/what-youre-getting-wrong-about-appalachia\">Passive, poor and white? What people keep getting wrong about Appalachia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These announcements of local aid were the first, but by no means the last, but what is remarkable is that they come from a part of the country that has struggled with extreme poverty for generations: central Appalachia. We are a place either forgotten about or disparaged by much of America. Despite what the rest of the county thinks of us, in a pandemic, there is no place I would rather be than in Appalachia.</p> <p>I live in the poorest county in my state and one of the poorest communities in the nation, a remote town 90 minutes from an airport. My town is boosted by the presence of a state university, an economic benefit the nearby villages do not have, yet in the face of the pandemic, the university switched to online instruction. The college students were ordered to vacate, leaving many businesses un-patronized and even unstaffed. Under mandates from the governor, bars, restaurants, barbershops and hair salons have closed, and gatherings of more than 10 people are forbidden.</p> <p>These new mandates, combined with social distancing, make it difficult for traditional businesses to operate. But small local businesses, such as the ones that exist in my town, have more flexibility. Without corporate policies and with less liability, they have adapted \u2013and fast. The town breweries offer carryout beer in growlers. The local ciderhouse, my personal favorite, is making a carryout cocktail. Restaurants switched to delivery, with one place quickly whipping up a new walk-in menu, and reorganizing the inside of the restaurant to minimize contact between patrons.</p> <p>Business changes like these cannot operate successfully without changes coming from the municipal level as well, something we\u2019re able to do easier and faster in a small town. So, many parking meters have been changed to free, 10-minute parking for food pickup. The local distillery has shifted to making hand sanitizer, working with the FDA for official approval.</p> <p>Remote education has yet to begin for the thousands of children home from school in my county, primarily because living in a remote place, many children still do not have internet at home. But the school district is bringing mobile hotspots to the houses without access, and loaning Chromebooks to kids without computers.</p> <p>Certainly, the pandemic will be horrific to places already <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/articles/2020-03-19/coronavirus-could-crush-the-poor-and-homeless-advocates-warn\">devastated by poverty</a>. Many people in my town do not have primary care physicians \u2013 there are simply not enough doctors \u2013 and use the ER for care. Many others do not have insurance. Though the coronavirus is revealing the many, many cracks in our fractured country, uncovering the dirty truth about who gets care and <a href=\"https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/2020/03/21/coronavirus-comes-terrible-time-reeling-appalachian-kentucky/2878214001/\">who does not,</a> I hope it is also unveiling how small communities like my own make it work, and have for years, even under unbearable conditions: through local networks, neighbors helping neighbors, even strangers.</p> <p>My small community is rising up together. A large mutual aid group quickly formed, with posts ranging from the bulk food store offering to take orders on notes outside their door and deliver, to posts from individuals, like a man who wrote he has a lot of condoms and can deliver to anyone in the county in need of birth control.</p> <p>Resilience and practicality are hallmarks of Appalachia. I spent a lot of time in a house without indoor plumbing, so the toilet paper shortage doesn\u2019t alarm me that much. One of my friends is sewing medical masks, using the loops from a child\u2019s potholder weaving kit for the earpieces. It\u2019s spring, and I plan a big garden this year, growing enough to share.</p> <p>When it comes to the pandemic in America, no one is coming to save us. And no one knows more what that\u2019s like than Appalachia. We are used to doing it alone and under the extreme pressure of poverty and all that it entails: low incomes, lack of sleep, lack of access to care.</p> <p>How to get through now? Look to the rural, neglected places that have always made it work and done it alone together. <em>Nelsonville will be on earth forever</em>, was an ad for one of the brickmakers in the town nearest my own. The brick factories are no more, but the town lives on, and only by helping each other with the little we have will we survive to fight another day. We have been fighting for survival, recognition and dignity our whole lives.</p>",

  "<p>The volume of food that would otherwise be wasted and is received every week by the UK\u2019s largest food redistribution charity has more than doubled since the coronavirus lockdown.</p> <p>In a better-than-average \u201cgood week\u201d FareShare would typically be given 350 tonnes of food via its 24 regional distribution centres, but this has soared to 711 tonnes a week after the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/london-pubs-cinemas-and-gyms-may-close-in-covid-19-clampdown\">ordered the closure</a> of millions of hospitality businesses around the country, it has revealed.</p> <p>The organisation takes good quality surplus food from across the industry \u2013 direct from suppliers as well as from supermarkets \u2013 and redistributes it to almost 11,000 frontline charities and community groups. This typically provides 1m meals a week to vulnerable and needy people, along with essentials for regional food banks run by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/13/more-people-than-ever-turning-to-food-banks-charity-says\">the Trussell Trust</a> and smaller local projects.</p> <p>Its chief executive, Lindsay Boswell, said the organisation had \u201cripped up\u201d its business model in order to adjust to the unprecedented disruption to the food and drink supply chain triggered by the outbreak of the coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been real plate-spinning,\u201d said Boswell. \u201cIn the early phase we suffered from a complete collapse in food donations as shoppers rushed out to panic buy and demand soared. That was very worrying. Then the government\u2019s decision to close food service companies opened the floodgates.</p> <p>\u201cWith diminishing numbers of volunteers due to self-isolation we had to channel all our resources into making sure it was collected on time and not wasted.\u201d Without physical distancing restrictions the organisation would probably be tripling its flow of food, he estimates. There has also been a switch in focus from providing food for meals to assembling food parcels.</p> <p>Boswell says virtually all donations have been gratefully received although there had been some \u201cwell-motivated offers, including a pantechnicon full of iceberg lettuces\u201d which could not be used due to a massive amount of existing salad crop. Even before the outbreak of the coronavirus, demand for surplus food had soared against a background of growing dependence on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/food-banks\">food banks</a> and rising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/homelessness\">homelessness </a>in the UK.</p> <p>But wholesalers have been struggling to deal with tens of thousands of tonnes of fruit and vegetables, fresh meat and dairy products no longer required by restaurants, hotels and schools.</p> <p>As much as \u00a320m of food with a shelf life of less than three months was at one stage lying in warehouses, according to the Federation of Wholesale Distributors, after the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/london-pubs-cinemas-and-gyms-may-close-in-covid-19-clampdown\">ordered the closure</a> of millions of hospitality businesses around the country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Boswell added: \u201cAn estimated 35% of the calories we consume are outside the home. So if you think of all those meals, whether school lunches or going out to restaurants in the evening \u2013 that\u2019s a lot of food that now has nowhere to go.\u201d</p> <p>In London FareShare has partnered with the capital\u2019s two other major food redistribution charities \u2013 City Harvest and the Felix Project \u2013 to provide a more targeted emergency response service for Londoners during the coronavirus crisis. The three organisations have formed the London Food Alliance, with each taking the lead in a designated borough to help distribute food to people in local communities.</p> <p>It is now boosting its 1,500-strong army of volunteers, helped by a new partnership with the British Red Cross, and in a single week it received more volunteer applications than for the whole of last year. \u201cWe regard many new volunteers as the fifth cavalry \u2013 we may not need you now but we will,\u201d said Boswell. A call for experienced forklift operators led to 24 qualified people responding within just two hours.</p> <p>As well as routinely supplying surplus food, FareShare\u2019s major supermarket partners are also providing \u201ctop up\u201d food as well as funding to help with logistics. This week the Co-op convenience store chain scrapped its \u00a32.5m Easter advertising campaign and will instead use the airtime to encourage viewers to donate to FareShare.</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s easy to imagine why Hollywood felt it might take a maverick genius to film Dune, Frank Herbert\u2019s 1965 sci-fi/fantasy opus. The novel, and its five sequels, are phantasmagorical and psychedelic in the extreme, like Star Wars on acid. In fact, George Lucas borrowed much from Herbert\u2019s story: the witchy women of the Bene Gesserit are not so far from the wise, all-seeing Jedi (though Lucas wisely ditched the former\u2019s freaky, eugenics-influenced breeding programmes). The planet of Arrakis, where the novel\u2019s hero Paul Atreides finds himself caught up in a devious aristocratic plot to bring down his family\u2019s noble house, resembles the desert planet of Tatooine where we first meet Luke Skywalker.<br><br>The first maverick to take on the task was the controversial Chilean-French film-maker Alejandro Jodorowsky in the early 1970s. Jodorowsky duly dreamt up a proposed 15-hour film in which Orson Welles was to play Baron Harkonnen, and Salvador Dal\u00ed the emperor, Shaddam IV. HR Giger, the Swiss artist who would later create the xenomorphs for Ridley Scott\u2019s Alien, was brought in to work on the central building, the Harkonnen castle, while Pink Floyd were recruited to help with the soundtrack. Naturally, nobody wanted to fund this insane venture, whose passing into myth is chronicled in the fascinating 2013 documentary Jodorowsky\u2019s Dune.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg4OCeSTL08\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jg4OCeSTL08?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>David Lynch finally got a new version into cinemas in 1984, only for Universal to release a two-hour cut he hated so much he had his name removed from the credits. In fact, Lynch was so disappointed in the film, he often refuses to discuss it in interviews. This is hardly surprising when you consider the awful inner dialogue that was added to the soundtrack for most of the main characters in post-production, seemingly to paper over the cracks from a confusing edit.<br><br>There are some wonderful moments to be witnessed in what remains of the movie, but it\u2019s still hard to deny that Lynch made a bucketload of inexplicable errors, such as making the Bene Gesserit bald, reducing them to background players and introducing those ridiculous heart plugs, not to mention the disgusting scene in which Kenneth McMillan\u2019s Baron Harkonnen has his face pustules drained. At least the film\u2019s silliest segue, during which Kyle MacLachlan\u2019s Paul and his Fremen allies ride to victory on top of Arrakis\u2019 giant sandworms, has its roots in the original book.<br><br>Villeneuve has said his adaptation, which is due to hit cinemas in December, is unlikely to resemble Lynch\u2019s lurid take. \u201cI\u2019m going back to the book, and going to the images that came out when I read it,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/dune-reboot-denis-villeneuve-says-new-version-will-nothing-like-david-lynchs-181932933.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2luZW1hYmxlbmQuY29tL25ld3MvMTcyNTc3MC93aHktdGhlLWR1bmUtcmVib290LXdvbnQtYmUtYmFzZWQtb2ZmLWRhdmlkLWx5bmNocy12ZXJzaW9u&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKh8OdFntOariFacEOT91P_0qrB519nt_oiMDca8FAmvVHzM7qDpjpLAd_DUUkgPNxWUNRFpm2KWgOi167Po-tGHFQXp9ubBgzxRIRtG_-tXYuQhGrbNbcK_6v8NrXnEGLF_JivEiGBRQomgpVlrV5K6huP1B60T-Wf6bJVuiDEy\">he told Yahoo</a>. \u201cDavid Lynch is one of the best film-makers alive, I have massive respect for him. When I saw his adaptation I was impressed, but it was not what I had dreamed of, so I\u2019m trying to make the adaptation of my dreams.\u201d <br><br>The director also says it\u2019s likely that his film will be the first of at least two movies based on Herbert\u2019s original 1965 novel. Dune acolytes suspect this will see the first episode finishing with Paul having established himself as the Fremen\u2019s messiah, the Muad\u2019Dib, with part two focusing on the battle to retake Arrakis from the Harkonnens and the emperor.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPTIEWTYEI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KwPTIEWTYEI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Casting appears to be impeccable, with MacLachlan lookalike Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as Paul Atreides, Rebecca Ferguson as his Bene Gesserit mother Lady Jessica and Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd as Baron Harkonnen. Villeneuve has also stored up goodwill in spades from science fiction fans after delivering the futuristic double whammy of Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 over the past few years. <br><br>Where Lynch and Jodorowsky seemed to indulge themselves by taking the trippy futurism of Herbert\u2019s original as a jumping-off point into even weirder territory, the suspicion is that Villeneuve will take the hallucinatory lunacy of the source material and do his level best to drawn it into a cohesive tale, like a conductor who finds himself charged with taming an orchestra of eccentric musicians. <br><br>Perhaps what Dune really needs is not a maverick genius at all, but merely a genius. In Denis Villeneuve, the long-awaited film adaptation might have finally found just that.</p>",

  "<p>Shhh! That\u2019s not just the wind \u2013 there\u2019s definitely something out there, moving around outside the tent. A lion, perhaps; do they hunt at night? Or a polar bear? I believe they often rip tents apart in order to devour the human occupants. Perhaps it is some<em>one</em> \u2013 a human, a murderer almost certainly. Unless of course it\u2019s just Gatsby, next door\u2019s cat, out on the scrounge again or pooing in our flower bed. Whatever, we\u2019re way too scared to unzip and have a look.</p> <p>We \u2013 my family \u2013 are camping in the garden. I say my family, but it\u2019s just me and the boys, eight and six. Their mum started off with us, but she disappeared after bedtime stories. Her words on leaving the tent? \u201cI\u2019m just going inside; I may be some time.\u201d I think she had planned it.</p> <p>To be honest, it\u2019s a good thing she left. Our four-person tent didn\u2019t fit in our tiny garden. So we put up my old festival tent, cosy for three; even that only just went in. I know, we\u2019re lucky \u2013 especially now \u2013 to have any garden. But I think you could do a version of this even without one. Put a tent up inside. If you haven\u2019t got a tent, make one out of sheets and the sofa cushions, maybe. Use your imagination \u2013 and then again to decide where you are. Alexa, play jungle noises.</p> <p>Why is home-holidaying such a great idea? It\u2019s cheap \u2013 really cheap; almost certainly the cheapest holiday you\u2019ll ever take. No fares, no accommodation, no campsite fees, just what you would have been consuming anyway, plus one bag of marshmallows. You can turn the heating off, too, and anyone still inside can put on an extra layer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5cdc516fb34f91d56d1ec22678a471ddbe3c27a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5cdc516fb34f91d56d1ec22678a471ddbe3c27a/0_0_5152_3864/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sam Wollaston's boys take turns to burn their marshmallows\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sam\u2019s boys take turns to burn their marshmallows.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: provided by Sam Wollaston</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s no added eco-guilt \u2013 this is almost certainly the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/green\">greenest holiday</a> you\u2019ll ever take, too. No flying, no driving, no emissions at all, apart from the ones that children produce anyway \u2013 especially in small tents, it seems. There may be a fire \u2013 but ours was just two bits of wood. Sorry, I suppose it wasn\u2019t entirely necessary, but I think we\u2019ve got some credit in that department.</p> <p>It\u2019s something to do, and something <em>different</em> to do. That has been one of the big problems during lockdown \u2013 the sameness of every day, of the weekdays merging into weekends, of not being able to get out, the lack of any kind of excitement or adventure that doesn\u2019t come via a screen. Garden camping offers proper terror, without putting anyone in danger, although I guess that depends on where you live.</p> <p>It is actually \u2013 amazingly and in spite of everything \u2013 quite fun. Not just doing stuff you do on holiday, and being a bit scared, but simply sleeping in a big pile together. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s transferable inside. Obviously, there\u2019s an upper age limit; if ours were much older, it would almost certainly be the lamest, most ridiculous idea ever. But this time they enjoyed it, the big-pileness of it, being close as a family, talking, having a laugh. Fighting, too, of course, but fighting somewhere new. They want there to be a next time.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They enjoyed it, being close as a family, talking, having a laugh.

We cooked our pasta inside, but brought it out to eat. We made a fire in the barbecue to burn marshmallows on afterwards. Different people do different things on holiday; we burn marshmallows. Do what you do on holiday, to make it feel (a bit) like one.</p> <p>We also play cards on holiday, so after brushing teeth at the outside tap, that\u2019s what we did: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/nov/22/rules-card-games-old-maid\">old maid</a> and whist.

(The boys were all right \u2013 they shared the air mattress \u2013 but I was on the ground.) And a noisy one. Camping in north-west London, you hear things you might not normally associate with camping, or hear in Wales, say. Not just the prowling murderer/cat, but the Jubilee line, bringing key-worker heroes home. A domestic disagreement (it\u2019s a good way of getting to know the neighbours better). An electric guitar from up the road (\u201cOI, PIPE DOWN, JIMI HENDRIX!\u201d) Also sirens \u2013 lots of sirens \u2013 a sobering reminder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">what this is all really about</a>.

By the time we unzip and emerge, blinking and shivering, the local goldfinch posse is burbling busily at the bird feeder.

  "<p>I was in my mid-20s when the rock band I was in, Young Guns, started to become successful. We went to San Francisco to record our album, and one night a mutual friend introduced me to a girl called Jenn. We connected instantly: you know when you just <em>know</em> \u2013 there was something about her. I had no idea when we met that she was a vlogger and fashion influencer with millions of followers.</p> <p>Soon after we met, Jenn flew to London. On our first proper date we went for a picnic at Alexandra Palace \u2013 that was the first time she asked me to take a photo of her. I felt a bit of pressure; I wanted to get it right as I was very focused on trying to make her fall in love with me.</p> <p>Not long after that, we started going out. I appeared in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpdLt6xD8MI\" title=\"\">Meet My Boyfriend</a> video on her fashion YouTube channel, Clothes Encounters. We answered questions from her fans, like what nicknames we call each other. At the time, I pretty much had no idea what YouTube was but it felt great to know she wanted to show me off.</p> <p>She continued to ask me to take photos of her whenever we met. We were dating, but she was also creating content for her channels. I was living in my own bubble and barely used Instagram, but I knew how to take a good photo: I was mainly focused on her being in frame, pressing the right button and making sure there wasn\u2019t a massive trash can next to her. Then I started to focus on the angles, as I\u2019d taken a few wonky ones. I didn\u2019t really think much of it at the time, I just thought I was helping.</p> <p>The more trips I went on as a plus one, the more photos I was taking. I slipped into becoming what they call \u201can Instagram boyfriend\u201d, a romantic partner of an influencer who ends up taking all the photos and videos they post. It was difficult at times; there were moments when Jenn had had a long day and it was stressful, and I messed up a lot while learning. It\u2019s not uncommon for influencer couples to do this: 95% of the time, when a guy is dating an influencer he will end up being her videographer. It\u2019s really appealing; you get to shoot for your girl, be a plus one, go on incredible trips and learn a new craft.</p> <p>By the time I was 30, I wanted to try something new. I quit the band, packed my bags and moved to LA. Once I got there, I realised I had all this influencer experience.

  "<p>As the daughter of an air force officer and a nurse, I am fascinated by defence systems. There is none more impressive than the human immune system, equipped as it is with a rich arsenal to defend against different types of pathogen. Viruses have evolved to trick, bypass and evade these defences. Our immune systems have, in turn, learned to recognise and deter these virus stealth tactics. In Covid-19, the enemy is a tiny piece of genetic material wearing a lipid coat and a protein crown.</p> <p>So how is our immune system able to defend against viral infections, and how does this apply to Covid-19? The virus that causes Covid-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Sars-Cov-2), and was first detected in humans around five months ago. It is a coronavirus. \u201cCorona\u201d, in Latin, means crown. The virus is adorned with an outer layer of protein covered in spikes, like a crown. These spikes help the virus attach itself to target cells. The research community is<strong> </strong>fast learning about immunity to Covid-19, and we are also applying our knowledge of similar respiratory viruses to predict what to expect in this infection.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Importantly, Covid-19 cannot gain entry to our homes or bodies by itself \u2013 we have to let it in</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Think of a virus as a robot; it cannot reproduce so it needs a factory of materials \u2013 proteins, lipids and nucleotides \u2013<strong> </strong>to build copies of itself. The coat allows the virus to attach itself to the target cell\u2019s membrane. The virus then fuses with the cell and releases a<strong> </strong>shopping list of instructions<strong> </strong>on how to build and assemble new viruses. This shopping list, the virus genome, is written in nucleotides (RNA). The first job of a virus that enters our bodies is to invade target cells so that it can comfortably remove its coat and deploy its RNA.</p> <p>Once inside, the virus commandeers the cell and borrows cellular machinery<strong> </strong>to build more viruses before immune cells detect the intruders and raise the alarm. Antibody proteins that are able to stick to the virus-spike proteins, and prevent attachment to the target cells, are called neutralising antibodies: generating them is often the goal of protective vaccination.</p> <p>Our infected cells make the ultimate sacrifice and invite their own destruction by displaying distress signals for<strong> </strong>T-cells, which swiftly detect and kill them. T-cells are cytotoxic \u2013 powerful serial killers that can recognise peptide fragments of virus displayed on the infected cell surface. When they do, they release a payload of toxic enzymes that kill the infected cell in a \u201ckiss of death\u201d. This strategic martyrdom is organised by the immune system to deprive the virus of its replication factories and can lead to the reduction of viral load in the patient. It takes several days for antiviral T-cells to expand and antibodies to be generated. Here\u2019s the silver lining<strong>:</strong> memory cells ensure that if we encounter the same virus again, we can react immediately with pre-existing defences. Sars-Cov-2 is new to humanity so we have no protective immunological memory. Vaccines prepared using harmless parts of the virus can help us build protective memory.</p> <p>The virus\u2019s enemy superpower is spreading. The virus achieves this through \u201cshedding\u201d from infected patients. Sars-Cov-2 is expert at hopping from person to person, and in some people, it achieves a stealthy existence with mild or no symptoms. Once many copies of the virus are made, it needs to jump to another host. It hitches a ride on droplets that can be coughed or sneezed to a distance of up to two metres. Droplets can survive on surfaces for several hours enabling pick<strong>-</strong>up by a new host, or they can be directly inhaled if another person is in close proximity. Studies are emerging into <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/should-pets-be-tested-coronavirus\">animal hosts</a> \u2013 so far the virus has been detected in a few ferrets, cats, tigers and dogs. No animal deaths have yet been reported, and we don\u2019t know if animals can transmit back to humans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/coronavirus-vaccine-scientist-what-needs-to-be-done-now-hanneke-schuitemaker\">Vaccine scientist: \u2018Everything is so new in dealing with this coronavirus\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The age differential in fatalities for Covid-19 suggests, with some exceptions, that a healthy immune system is usually able to control infection. Meanwhile, an ageing or weakened immune system may struggle to deploy a protective arsenal. Importantly, Sars-Cov-2 cannot gain entry to our homes or bodies by itself \u2013 we have to let it in. This is why official advice has centred around<strong> </strong>cleaning our hands and avoiding touching our faces.</p> <p>We know that a healthy immune system is usually able to eliminate infection in a couple of weeks. However, we have no understanding of the components of our immune arsenal that contribute to this feat: some vaccines work by creating potent neutralising antibodies; other vaccines generate powerful memory T-cells. Antiviral antibodies emerge as early as three to four days after virus detection, but are they protective against future reinfection? We believe that antibodies to other coronaviruses (Sars, Mers) last from one to three years. Because this is a new virus, we don\u2019t yet know the answer to this question. Public Health England is <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/878121/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-strategy.pdf\">recruiting</a> 16,000 to 20,000 volunteers to monitor antibodies once a month for six to 12 months to confirm whether we can generate long-lasting antibody responses to Sars-Cov-2. Determining the quality of these antibodies will be important to understanding long-term protection.</p> <p>What is our most potent immune weapon against Covid-19? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bertoletti_lab/status/1247015473683632129\">Cytotoxic T-cells</a> may play an important role. Immunologists and virologists are working together to discover the correlates of protection, to design vaccines that offer long-term defences against Covid-19. Years of investment in research means that we can use existing approaches to respond to this new threat, and early mobilisation of research funders, philanthropists and academics are diverting resources to bolster these efforts on an unprecedented scale. Experience has taught us that vaccines are able to eradicate infections from this planet (for instance, smallpox), and medicines against viruses that don\u2019t embed their genetic material to our own (for example, hepatitis C) can also achieve this.</p> <p>Our secret weapon is research. Scientists are working hard on understanding Covid-19, and collaboration is key to this effort. But until a vaccine or treatment is available, we ought to work hard to protect ourselves and our families: isolate and prevent transmission by using physical distancing, face masks and sensible hygiene. If we all do our part, this little virus holding the world to ransom won\u2019t stand a chance.</p> <p>\u2022 Zania Stamataki is a senior lecturer and researcher in viral immunology at the University of Birmingham</p>",

  "<p>As a kid I read two kinds of books: cheap, paperback science fiction novels with covers festooned with spaceships and robots, and Herg\u00e9\u2019s Adventures of Tintin. How I adored Herg\u00e9! Best of all were those Tintin adventures that combined my two passions: <a href=\"http://en.tintin.com/albums/show/id/34/page/0/0/the-shooting-star\">The Shooting Star</a> (1941-42), <a href=\"http://en.tintin.com/albums/show/id/40/page/0/0/destination-moon\">Destination Moon/Explorers on the Moon</a> (1950-53) and <a href=\"https://tintin.fandom.com/wiki/Flight_714\">Flight 714 to Sydney</a> (1966-67).</p> <p>Child-me pored over on these books and their wonderful <em><a href=\"https://comicbookglossary.wordpress.com/ligne-claire/\">ligne claire</a></em> images. Captain Haddock was, I think, the first fictional character I genuinely loved. To this day I maintain that there is real genius in his characterisation, the way his grumpiness and slapstick reinforce rather than erode his splendid courage and comradeship, and the way his character grows, from the cowardly booze-hound we first meet in The Crab With the Golden Claws into something approaching noble.</p> <p>Still, to reread Tintin as an adult can be startling. Take The Shooting Star: a meteor is hurtling towards the Earth, growing brighter in the sky night by night, making the world so hot the tarmac melts on the roads. It promises apocalypse, but the meteor misses us, though an island-sized chunk breaks off and falls into the Atlantic. Since this rock contains valuable minerals unknown to our world, Tintin and Haddock mount an expedition to claim it. But a rival expedition also wants the prize.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d51ddf2bfc14d1df0097af5c8dbf3274787c02ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d51ddf2bfc14d1df0097af5c8dbf3274787c02ba/102_0_2212_3409/649..jpg\" alt=\"A page from Herg\u00e9\u2019s manuscript for The Shooting Star.\" width=\"649\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A page from Herg\u00e9\u2019s manuscript for The Shooting Star.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Studio Sebert/PIASA/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Writing in Nazi-occupied Belgium in 1941, Herg\u00e9 makes these rivals nasty Americans managed by a venal financier called Bohlwinkel, a bulb-nosed, pin-eyed caricature Jew. After the war, and mindful of the US market, Herg\u00e9 revised away the US: in later editions the rivals hail from the fictional country of S\u00e3o Rico, their stars-and-stripes redrawn as an imaginary flag. (Although their ships are still incongruously called the SS Peary and the SS Kentucky Star.) But he left in the disfiguring antisemitism, which speaks, alas, to his postwar priorities.</p> <p>None of this registered with me as a child, but as an adult I can\u2019t help but be struck by it. Collaborator is a harsh word, but it\u2019s hard to deny its applicability to Herg\u00e9. Then again, Tintin explicitly stands for interracial friendship, most prominently with his Chinese best friend, Tchang. (The two share one of Herg\u00e9\u2019s best stories, Tintin in Tibet). And The Red Sea Sharks (1958) is filled with horror at the modern-day trafficking of black Africans, even if its representation of those Africans is still mired in the patronising stereotypes of Tintin in the Congo (1931, a book quite properly unavailable in the UK because of its racism). Tintin, this blond Aryan, this upholder of the bourgeois status quo, is also Tintin, gay hero, living openly and happily with Haddock, befriending people regardless of class or race. It\u2019s complicated.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/gallery/2016/jan/16/tintin-herges-masterpiece\">Tintin: Herg\u00e9's masterpiece \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Shooting Star is simultaneously a piece of Nazi-era propaganda and an ingeniously surreal subversion of that propaganda. It\u2019s a story about a team from German-occupied Europe beating the US to the meteoric prize. (Tintin pips the Yanks to the post by means of a deck-launched German Arado 196 seaplane.) But their prize is a nightmare: the extraterrestrial constitution of the meteor causes mushroom spores to bloom and swell to enormous size. A discarded apple core grows in moments into a gigantic tree dropping apples the size of boulders. A spider as big as a cow appears and chases Tintin across the waste. At the end, the mysterious star slips below the waves, as if it had never been, and Tintin and Snowy are rescued in the nick of time.</p> <p>Early in the story, when an escaped lunatic attempts to sabotage the expedition ship with dynamite, Tintin talks him down, using a megaphone to pretend to be the voice of God. When I read it as a kid, that seemed daft and funny. Now the whole story strikes me as a complicated riff on madness, on the insanity of the war years, on the arachnid ideology of Nazism, the giganticism of the US and the ultimately void prize for which they were competing. Fevered and brilliant, monstrous and hilarious, the book is a dream-haunting vision of sanity melting into madness, like the tarmac dissolving hot flowing tar at the book\u2019s beginnings. As the shooting star sinks into the blankness of the sea, so everything solid melts into fluidity.</p>",

  "<p>On the Andrew Marr Show last Sunday, speaking about Covid-19, Prof Neil Ferguson was described as being \u201cmore influential right now than any politician\u201d. Ferguson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/neil-ferguson-coronavirus-expert-who-is-working-on-despite-symptoms\">leads a team of modellers</a> at Imperial College London whose mission has been to predict the pattern and health impact of coronavirus transmission in the UK under different scenarios, and thereby help government make the right decisions about how best to protect the population.</p> \n<p>The UK has some of the best infectious disease modellers in the world, and the government has been wise to draw upon their expertise. But all models have their limitations, and none can avoid the fact that decision-making must also be informed by people with relevant expertise and experience, and by the facts on the ground. In the case of Covid-19, where so much about the disease and its transmission dynamics is still unknown or unclear, models are useful \u2013 but experience and sound judgment are crucial.</p> \n<p>This is becoming apparent across the world. Countries that lived through the experience of Sars and Mers appear to have been better prepared to deal with Covid-19 than those that didn\u2019t. And in Canada, <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-ontario-quebec-covid-19-1.5524056\">the success of British Columbia</a> in controlling Covid-19 compared with other provinces has been partly attributable to the combined ingredients of political experience and good judgment.</p> \n<p>There is also a non-scientific element to decision-making which involves choosing between competing demands and needs in society, determining what is ethical and moral, and balancing challenges that are current and immediate with those that will only emerge in the future. For example, a model that incorporates value judgments is needed to balance the direct, visible and dramatic harms of Covid-19 with the more indirect, chronic and hidden social and economic harms of lockdown.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, while it is often said that Covid-19 \u201cdoes not discriminate\u201d, this statement is only partially true. The virus disproportionately affects older people and men; and we can be sure that the effects of both the virus and the collateral damage of control measures will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-inequality-managers-zoom-cleaners-offices\">disproportionately affect the poorer and more marginalised</a> segments of society. How we manage this differentiated vulnerability is all about ethics and politics. It may be informed by a scientific model, but it shouldn\u2019t be disguised as a technocratic problem that can be resolved by mathematical equations.</p> \n<p>It is easy to be entranced by the cleverness of models that map, measure and predict the complex interactions of multiple natural and social variables. There is something impressive about the ability to produce answers in the form of precisely calculated numbers, and professionally crafted charts and graphs. And for politicians, nothing is more convenient than being able to say that they are merely following \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/uk-coronavirus-policy-scientific-dominic-cummings\">the science</a>\u201d and evidence.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ba9786c6-c779-4063-8bf9-1d3009eb7c70\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3qV7R2iYVXg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>While Marr\u2019s comment about Ferguson being the most influential person in the country was rhetorical, it hints at the perception that epidemiological modelling has played a disproportionately influential role in shaping the UK\u2019s strategy and plans. Others have pointed out that some of the earlier modelling work had gaps that have adversely affected policy decisions. These include not accounting for the potential role of testing and contact tracing in mitigating the epidemic; not modelling the impact of sick patients on intensive care beds and other parts of the health system; and not modelling the epidemic across different regions of the UK.</p> \n<p>It is not clear what caused these omissions. Perhaps they were the result of blindspots that persisted due to the lack of external scrutiny and challenge. In the case of the sidelining of testing and contact tracing, perhaps it was because the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) had concluded that these measures were not worth while \u2013 a view that is understandable if Sage also saw the building up of herd immunity through natural infection as part of its strategy.</p> \n<p>There has been lots of speculation as to why the UK delayed lockdown compared with other countries; why it was slow to increase viral testing capacity; and why the NHS was left so poorly prepared. Now is not the time to look backwards. Neither would I want to place any criticism on modellers. Rigorous modelling is done by clever modellers; but the design and testing of models, including the assumptions built into models and the questions that modellers have been asked to help answer, is a collective responsibility.</p> \n<p>Modelling is vital and could assist greatly in going forward. In particular, two things should be urgently modelled. The first is to model the impact of different strategies that will help us avoid the harms of draconian, population-wide lockdown. This should include modelling the costs and benefits of weekly viral testing of the whole population (not 100,000 tests a day, but 10 million tests a day), or a more modest but greatly expanded testing regime, combined with aggressive case detection and contact tracing, coupled with continued physical distancing and improved hygiene. The former idea may sound radical and extreme, but is a serious proposal that could be implemented if there was sufficient political will.</p> \n<p>Second, we must model (and then keep monitoring) the health and socioeconomic impacts of both the virus and the control measures, with short-, medium- and long-term timeframes, and with a social lens to look at how the virus has impacted differentially across society. For some reason, there was no modelling of the socioeconomic impact of lockdown. This was an omission \u2013 and as we enter the beginning of what could be a global economic recession, we could see thousands of lives cut short from this collateral damage.</p> \n<p>Finally, from a policymaking perspective, there are two things needed. First, we need greater transparency and participation to allow effective scrutiny and challenge from scientists and public health specialists who are more independent of government. This will avoid the danger of groupthink and blindspots. Second, we must better acknowledge the limitations of evidence-based policy and recognise the importance of expertise, experience and sound judgment.</p> \n<p>\u2022 David McCoy is a professor of Global Public Health and director of the Centre for Public Health at Queen Mary University of London.</p>",

Flanked by an international cast of scientists, he always seems confident that if we have hope, listen to the experts and pull together, we will get through this.</p> <p>Watching this reassuring spectacle, it is possible to imagine a world in which every nation respects the WHO\u2019s authority, follows its advice and lets it coordinate the flow of information, resources and medical equipment across national boundaries to areas of greatest need.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/01/the-who-v-coronavirus-why-it-cant-handle-the-pandemic-podcast\">The WHO v coronavirus: why it can't handle the pandemic \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That is not the world we live in. \u201cThe W.H.O. really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1247540701291638787\" title=\"\">tweeted</a> Donald Trump on 7 April, summing up just one of the many lines of criticism the WHO is currently facing. It is not just Trump \u2013 even some of the WHO\u2019s supporters in government, academia and NGOs argue that since the start of the coronavirus crisis, it has caved in to nationalist bullies, praised draconian quarantine measures and failed to protect the liberal international order of which it is a linchpin. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a situation where it looks like WHO doesn\u2019t want to exercise its authority,\u201d said David Fidler, a fellow in global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and a regular consultant to the WHO.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the WHO is desperately struggling to get its 194 member states to actually follow its guidance. The WHO\u2019s leaders are \u201cvery frustrated,\u201d said John MacKenzie, a virologist and adviser on the WHO\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.who.int/ihr/procedures/novel-coronavirus-2019/ec-22012020-members/en/\" title=\"\">emergency committee</a>. \u201cThe messages come out loud and clear, and some disregard the warnings. The US largely did, the UK largely did.\u201d</p> <p>On 11 March, the day Tedros declared the coronavirus a pandemic, he spoke darkly of \u201calarming levels of inaction\u201d from many countries. Pressed by journalists to name them, Mike Ryan, the usually no-nonsense Irish trauma doctor who heads the WHO\u2019s Covid-19 response, demurred. \u201cYou know who you are,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwe don\u2019t criticise our member states in public\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f5d9b5d69d079af3d45a26a68aba8a4108aca8e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5d9b5d69d079af3d45a26a68aba8a4108aca8e6/0_100_4554_2732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump at a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House on April 08, 2020 in Washington, DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump at a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a simple reason for this. For all the responsibility vested in the WHO, it has little power. Unlike international bodies such as the World Trade Organization, the WHO, which is a specialised body of the UN, has no ability to bind or sanction its members. Its annual operating budget, about $2bn in 2019, is smaller than that of many university hospitals, and split among a dizzying array of public health and research projects. The WHO is less like a military general or elected leader with a strong mandate, and more like an underpaid sports coach wary of \u201closing the dressing room\u201d, who can only get their way by charming, grovelling, cajoling and occasionally pleading with the players to do as they say.</p> <p>The WHO \u201chas been drained of power and resources\u201d, said Richard Horton, editor of the influential medical journal the Lancet. \u201cIts coordinating authority and capacity are weak. Its ability to direct an international response to a life-threatening epidemic is non-existent.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, the international order on which the WHO relies is fraying, as aggressive nationalism becomes normalised around the world. \u201cAll the previous rules about global norms, public health and understanding of what\u2019s expected in terms of an outbreak has crumbled,\u201d said Lawrence Gostin, director of the WHO Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. \u201cNone of us know where this is leading.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The WHO was born during the moment of hopeful internationalism that followed the chaos of the second world war. The idea of global collaboration in fighting disease was not new \u2013 in the 19th century, at periodic International Sanitary Conferences, countries had standardised quarantine procedures for cholera and yellow fever \u2013 but the WHO constitution, adopted in 1948, envisioned a far grander global mission, nothing less than \u201cthe attainment by all people of the highest possible levels of health\u201d.</p> <p>One of the WHO\u2019s favourite success stories is the role it played in eliminating smallpox, a disease that was still killing millions each year in the 50s, despite the existence of a vaccine. Although the WHO worked on immunisation research, its most vital role was organisational and diplomatic. In 1959, it convinced the Soviet Union to manufacture 25 million vaccine doses, which the WHO would distribute. Not to be left behind, the US donated millions of dollars to vaccination programmes, both directly and through the WHO. By the late 60s, every nation in the UN was sending a detailed weekly report to WHO headquarters on their number of smallpox cases and recent progress. And in 1979, WHO declared smallpox eradicated, a first in world history. The WHO didn\u2019t provide the most money, immunise the most people, or invent key technologies such as the <a href=\"https://www.globalhealthnow.org/object/bifurcated-needle\" title=\"\">bifurcated needle</a>, but it is hard to imagine smallpox having been defeated without it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4044c399a9a92c0ce5d57746c8e2d81421beb2e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4044c399a9a92c0ce5d57746c8e2d81421beb2e4/0_0_4252_2835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Posters of WHO chief Tedros Adhanom in Sao Paulo, Brazil last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Posters of WHO chief Tedros Adhanom in Sao Paulo, Brazil last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fernando Bizerra Jr/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If the story of smallpox eradication shows the WHO acting as something like an international ministry of public health, it doesn\u2019t explain its current position as an emergency service, surveying the world for disease outbreaks and springing into action to contain them. That is a more recent addition to its portfolio, which came after a period, in the 80s and 90s, when the WHO seemed to be losing its earlier dynamism. The diseases it was partly created to address \u2013 smallpox, yellow fever and the plague \u2013 had either been eradicated or were in decline, and it was slow to identify new threats such as HIV/Aids. Under the leadership of Dr Hiroshi Nakajima, from 1988 to 1998, the organisation stagnated, and some member states complained about poor management and alleged petty corruption.</p> <p>Two things happened at the turn of the century that would shape the WHO we now see tackling the Covid-19 crisis. In 1998, the fiery former prime minister of Norway, Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, was elected director general. And in 2002, a farmer in China\u2019s Guangdong province became sick with a deadly, never-before-seen respiratory disease that quickly spread among the hospital staff who had treated him, and went on to become the first pandemic of the newly globalised 21st century: one that arose suddenly, had no treatment or cure, and spread with the speed and reach of international business.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Given the WHO\u2019s sprawling structure, vague mandate and reliance on diplomacy, its director general holds immense power to shape it. Even before she took on the role, Brundtland was comfortable on the world stage. \u201cI was already a political leader, and I was used to this kind of authority,\u201d she told me. Like her friend Kofi Annan, the charismatic UN leader, Brundtland believed that international bodies should be prepared to lead when necessary, rather than being bossed around by powerful nations. \u201cIf the job is to direct and coordinate global health, it\u2019s not a question of what one or several governments ask you to do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are working for humanity.\u201d</p> <p>Brundtland pushed the WHO to use its local contacts, diplomatic channels and the emerging internet to locate potential outbreaks, all of which made the organisation less reliant on national governments for information. Within just a few years, this strategy proved its worth. In November 2002, when the Chinese government became aware of the first cases of a novel respiratory disease, later named Sars, it failed to alert the WHO. But, as part of Brundtland\u2019s new approach, WHO staff were monitoring Chinese medical message boards and news media anyway, and were aware of what was then thought to be an atypical pneumonia outbreak. Adding to their suspicions, on 10 February 2003, David Heymann, who was then executive director of the WHO\u2019s communicable diseases cluster, received an email from the son of a former WHO staff member in China warning of a \u201cstrange contagious disease\u201d that had already killed 100 people, but which was \u201cnot allowed to be made known to the public\u201d. The WHO took the information it had to China, which made its first official report to the WHO the next day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fc41769b862cdfb9d6ccd578b4bfef561615bef5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc41769b862cdfb9d6ccd578b4bfef561615bef5/0_0_2000_1386/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO director-general Gro Harlem Brundtland (centre) gives polio immunisation to a young boy in New Delhi in January 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"693\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO director-general Gro Harlem Brundtland (centre) gives polio immunisation to a young boy in New Delhi in January 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Mcconnico/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although the WHO had no formal powers to monitor and censure its members, Brundtland wasn\u2019t shy about doing so anyway. In the ensuing months she would accuse China of withholding information, claiming that the outbreak might have been contained \u201cif the WHO had been able to help at an earlier stage\u201d and exhorting the Chinese to \u201clet us come in as quickly as possible!\u201d With remarkable speed, China fell in line and shared its data with the WHO. \u201cAfter her statements to China, no other countries hesitated,\u201d said Heymann.</p> <p>In March 2003, as the disease spread \u2013 reaching Hong Kong, Vietnam and then Canada \u2013 for the first time in its history, the WHO issued <a href=\"https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr23/en/\" title=\"\">advice against travelling</a> to affected areas. (Before then, the decision to advise on travel had always been left up to member states.) Despite having no formal powers to ground planes, the measures worked. \u201cPassengers and flights dropped dramatically as soon as we issued the recommendations,\u201d said Heymann.</p> <p>Brundtland\u2019s approach was not always popular, and some bridled under this new upstart WHO. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just China,\u201d Brundtland told me. \u201cThe mayor of Toronto [Mel Lastman] flew to Geneva to tell us take down the travel recommendation \u2013 while at the same time he was not containing the outbreak. He had people with Sars riding around the subway, no contact tracing, no following up. He couldn\u2019t accept we were telling him what to do!\u201d</p> <p>The WHO\u2019s response to Sars was considered a huge success. Fewer than 1,000 people worldwide died of the disease, despite it reaching a total of 26 countries. The pandemic was defeated not with vaccines or medicines, but with NPIs, or \u201cnon-pharmaceutical interventions\u201d in WHO parlance: travel warnings, tracking, testing and isolating cases, and a huge information-gathering operation across multiple countries, all made possible by the WHO\u2019s willingness to wield authority that it had, in a sense, created simply by speaking it into existence. \u201cBrundtland did things the WHO had no authority doing. She just did them,\u201d said Fidler. \u201cShe sort of used Sars as a way to test drive some very radical changes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAfter Sars, the WHO\u2019s position was essentially: that was great, let\u2019s formalise it,\u201d said Clare Wenham, a professor of global health policy at LSE. In 2005, the WHO drew up a new version of the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/ihr/about/en/\" title=\"\">International Health Regulations (IHR)</a>, the central legal document that all member states are bound by. According to Fidler, the updated IHR, which is in force to this day, is a radical document. It asks its members to prepare for public health threats according to standards set by the WHO, and to report any outbreaks and all subsequent developments. It also allows the WHO to declare a public health emergency of international concern (or PHEIC, pronounced, incredibly, \u201cfake\u201d), using its own information, over the objection of any single country. During an emergency, countries are expected to take the lead from the WHO\u2019s guidelines and report any deviations to the organisation. All of these requirements, bar the reporting of outbreaks, were new.</p> <p>But the document stopped short of giving the WHO real power if states refuse to comply. \u201cThe WHO isn\u2019t Nato, it\u2019s not the security council,\u201d said Gian Luca Burci, who was the WHO\u2019s legal counsel until 2018. The US, fixated on bioterrorism after 9/11, supported giving the organisation some extended powers, but was opposed by Brazil, Russia, India and China, which were wary of US influence. There was a general reluctance to hand an international organisation any more power. \u201cWHO members were happy with the actions that were taken during Sars, but there was definitely a sense afterward of \u2018What if that was us in China\u2019s spot?\u2019,\u201d explained Catherine Worsnop, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. In short: thanks for stopping the pandemic, but we don\u2019t want to be told what to do.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>If the WHO has seemed at times weak or tentative \u2013 very un-Brundtland-like \u2013 in its handling of the coronavirus crisis, it is partly because of its bruising experiences during the past decade. From 2009 onwards, the WHO faced condemnation from the press and the international community for its handling of successive crises, all during a decade when the financial and diplomatic order that sustained it began to break down.</p> <p>First, there was the outbreak of H1N1, or \u201cswine flu\u201d. The novel influenza virus was discovered in Mexico in March 2009, and by June, when the WHO declared a pandemic, there were more than 28,000 cases in 74 countries. Over the next year, the WHO coordinated the global response \u2013 less aggressively than during Sars \u2013 and on 10 August 2010, it declared the pandemic over. Almost immediately, the WHO\u2019s approach came under scrutiny. The death toll \u2013 18,500 confirmed deaths worldwide \u2013 was far lower than initially expected, particularly given the disease reached more than 200 countries. \u201cSuddenly you have people saying: \u2018Wait a minute, you really cried wolf on this,\u2019\u201d says Wenham. The media and several prominent European politicians demanded inquiries as to whether the WHO had mistakenly rung the alarm, and \u201ccost huge amounts of money and frightened people unnecessarily\u201d, as Paul Flynn, the former Labour MP who chaired one of the inquiries, told the Times in 2010.</p> <p>To this day, opinions are split as to whether H1N1 was a crisis headed off, or a false alarm. \u201cThe WHO is always at risk of being criticised as doing too much or too little,\u201d said Keiji Fukuda, the former WHO assistant director general who led the H1N1 response. Most of the former WHO staff and academics I spoke with agreed, proposing some version of the following as an iron law of public health: act slowly and you will be criticised for failing to stop preventable deaths; act aggressively and stop an outbreak before it becomes serious, and you will be accused of having overreacted. (After all, in the latter case, nothing too bad happened, so what was the big deal in the first place?)</p> <p>Fidler, who largely approves of WHO\u2019s quick action during H1N1, believes that the backlash led the WHO, which was then under the command of director general Margaret Chan, to become too tentative about calling for action in the future. This was a period when the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis was also starting to take its toll on its budget. \u201cThere was a big funding shortfall,\u201d said Andrew Cassels, director of strategy at the WHO between 2008 and 2013. \u201cCuts made to the emergency response programmes, personnel cuts.\u201d The funding gap stood at nearly $300m in 2012. Entire offices were shut, including a team of social scientists working on pandemic response.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"29cfebe6451704d592d057ee78cfddfd9ae9f240\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29cfebe6451704d592d057ee78cfddfd9ae9f240/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO staff training nurses to use protective gear in Freetown, Sierra Leone during the 2014 ebola outbreak.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO staff training nurses to use protective gear in Freetown, Sierra Leone during the 2014 ebola outbreak.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Duff/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the Ebola outbreak struck west Africa in 2014, the combination of the WHO\u2019s greater caution and reduced budget resulted in disaster. In contrast to the previous pandemic, this time the WHO was slow to act, and was widely perceived to have lost control of the situation. In the end, the US and several other nations <a href=\"https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2015/foreign_military_response_crucial_to_ebola.html\" title=\"\">deployed</a> more than 5,000 military personnel at the request of the affected countries, and an ad-hoc UN committee was created to take over responsibilities from the WHO. The outbreak eventually killed 11,310 people, the vast majority in just three countries \u2013 Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone \u2013 paralysing their health systems for months, and causing panic across the world. Prominent scientists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/22/experts-criticise-world-health-organisation-who-delay-ebola-outbreak\" title=\"\">judged</a> the WHO\u2019s response an \u201cegregious failure\u201d.</p> <p>Much of the blame fell on Chan herself. She appeared shell-shocked, stressing to the press that the WHO was a technical advisory body, and that it was national governments that had ultimate responsibility for their citizens\u2019 health. \u201cShe wanted the WHO to be an apolitical agency \u2013 more like technical support. There was a hesitancy there to push the full powers of the WHO,\u201d said Sara Davies, a professor of global health at Griffith University in Australia.</p> <p>The bold, proactive culture established after Sars had seemingly faded. Fidler believes that by delaying calling Ebola an emergency, and thus failing to organise an international response at a crucial moment, the WHO\u2019s leadership had shown they \u201cno longer had any faith in their authority\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Today, under Tedros, the WHO finds itself in uncharted territory. Not only is it facing by far the biggest pandemic in its history, it is also having to defend itself from the nations on which it most depends. \u201cIn my 25-plus years of working on global health issues, I cannot recall the leader of a prominent developed country threatening to punish WHO in the manner President Trump did,\u201d said Fidler, referring to the recent press conference in which Trump suggested putting \u201ca very powerful hold\u201d on US contributions to the WHO. In the same press conference, Trump accused the WHO of concealing information, being too slow to react to the virus, and, above all, showing favouritism towards China.</p> <p>Since the crisis began, Tedros has been repeatedly accused of being soft on China. Senator Marco Rubio recently <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bolton-joins-calls-for-who-directors-resignation-accomplice-to-chinas-massive-coverup\" title=\"\">told</a> Fox News that the Chinese government had \u201cused the WHO to mislead the world\u201d, and claimed that the WHO \u201cis either complicit or dangerously incompetent\u201d. The US senator Rick Scott put it more bluntly, accusing the WHO of \u201chelping Communist China cover up a global pandemic\u201d. (Tedros, meanwhile, has warned of the dangers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/apr/09/politicising-covid-19-like-playing-with-fire-who-director-general-says-after-trump-attack-video\">politicising the virus</a>.)</p> <p>Until very recently, the WHO was seen as a relatively neutral arena for China to extend its power. \u201cChina likes to find ways within the global system to give it a leading and benevolent image. The WHO was an uncontroversial place to do it,\u201d said Rana Mitter, the director of the University of Oxford China Centre. No longer. The extent of the initial coverup is still unclear, but there is no question that at least at the local level, Chinese officials knew about the outbreak of a novel disease for weeks before it was reported to the WHO. During that time, Chinese doctors were prevented from speaking out.</p> <p>John MacKenzie, the WHO\u2019s emergency committee adviser, told me that the organisation was \u201ca little misled\u201d about the Wuhan outbreak. He says that by the time the government alerted the WHO on 31 December, scientists in China had already determined via genome sequencing that the outbreak was caused by coronavirus. Yet the government didn\u2019t confirm that until 7 January and the full genome sequence was not officially shared until 12 January. \u201cThat\u2019s very slow,\u201d MacKenzie told me. \u201cFor at least two weeks, we could have been making far more kits and so on for testing.\u201d MacKenzie added that the number of cases officially declared by the Chinese in the first week \u2013 59 in the week ending 5 January \u2013 was \u201cnowhere near as many cases as you\u2019d expect\u201d. (The statistics released by the Chinese government continue to be questioned, with some <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/asia/coronavirus-china-grief-deaths.html?auth=login-email&amp;login=email\" title=\"\">reports</a> suggesting they may have seriously understated the number of coronavirus deaths.)</p> <p>Despite mounting frustrations \u2013 in mid-January, China also refused the WHO\u2019s request to send a team of scientific observers to Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak \u2013 Tedros has never come close to doing what Brundtland did and calling China out. Instead, on 28 January, he had a closed-door meeting with Xi Jinping in Beijing, and two days later, he praised Chinese efforts to contain the disease, declaring that China is \u201csetting a new standard for outbreak control\u201d. That same day, 30 January, the WHO declared a Pheic, and began issuing prescriptions to countries around the world. On 8 February, China finally allowed WHO observers into the country. For Tedros\u2019s supporters, this was vindication of his strategy of keeping China onside. For his critics, it was too little, too late.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"10a09ac53b686e3d6a7da5a1660151fdfce8847e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10a09ac53b686e3d6a7da5a1660151fdfce8847e/0_177_3996_2398/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO director-general Adhanom Ghebreyesus with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on 28 January 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO director-general Adhanom Ghebreyesus with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on 28 January 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Naohiko Hatta/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elected as WHO director general in July 2017, Tedros was supported by a bloc of African and Asian countries, including China, which has considerable influence with those members. (Tedros is himself from Ethiopia, where he served as health minister and then foreign minister between 2005 and 2016.) It was a \u201creally nasty\u201d election, said Davies, in which the powers that have traditionally shaped the WHO, such as the US, UK and Canada, lent their support to one of Tedros\u2019s rivals, the British doctor David Nabarro. During the campaign, Tedros was criticised for having served in a repressive government with a poor human rights record, and one of Nabarro\u2019s backers even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/23/who-elects-first-ever-african-director-general-after-tense-vote-tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus\" title=\"\">accused</a> Tedros of covering up a cholera epidemic during his time as health minister. (Tedros <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/13/health/candidate-who-director-general-ethiopia-cholera-outbreaks.html\" title=\"\">denied the</a> claim, describing it as a \u201clast-minute smear campaign\u201d, while Nabarro told the New York Times that he had never authorised his team to make this accusation against Tedros.) In response, Tedros\u2019s supporters mounted \u201ca collective pushback\u201d, said Davies, against the UK and its allies, eventually winning out. Tedros became the first director general from a so-called developing country since the Brazilian Dr Marcolino Gomes Candau in 1953.</p> <p>While his background is in politics, Tedros is not forthright or confrontational like Brundtland. In Ethiopia, his political party, the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF) was mostly comprised of ex-revolutionaries, men that \u201cseemed carved out of a rock\u201d, said Fantu Cheru, a professor at American University and former advisor to the Ethiopian government. Tedros was different \u2013 jovial and accessible, said Cheru, and able to make personal connections easily. \u201cHe is not very ideological, he believes he can work with anyone,\u201d said Mehari Taddele Maru, a professor at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy. Cheru also sees Tedros as a pragmatist. \u201cHe\u2019s not in the Chinese pocket. The Americans in particular wanted to destroy his image. Tedros knows how this game works. You need to have more allies than enemies, and those allies may not have a good track record.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Tedros did anything previous director generals would not have done,\u201d said Anthony Costello, the director of the UCL Institute for Global Health. \u201cHe needed a good relationship with China in order to get in.\u201d Even Lawrence Gostin, who has been a prominent critic of Tedros in the past, told me that \u201chis high praise for China is understandable. He is seeking to coax China into cooperation.\u201d He went on to note, though, that this strategy \u201cdoes risk the credibility of WHO as an objective agency.\u201d</p> <p>If the WHO thought it could sacrifice a bit of its credibility \u2013 overlooking China\u2019s obvious blunders in December and January in exchange for its compliance in February \u2013 and move on, it was mistaken. The argument over China\u2019s influence has been raging for weeks, not least since the government of Taiwan <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-taiwan/taiwan-says-who-ignored-its-coronavirus-questions-at-start-of-outbreak-idUSKBN21B160\" title=\"\">claimed</a> that the WHO had ignored its own early reports of human-to-human transmission of coronavirus as part of a larger history of appeasing China \u2013 which has blocked Taiwan from joining the WHO (and the UN) for decades.</p> <p>Now that Trump, scrambling for an answer to explain why the US now has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-world-map-which-countries-have-most-cases-deaths-covid-19\" title=\"\">more cases</a> of coronavirus than any other nation, has alighted upon the WHO and China as his preferred scapegoats, these questions will not go away. \u201cI don\u2019t think we will see the US government cut off funding,\u201d said Fidler. \u201cBut what\u2019s happened with this pandemic \u2013 with the WHO caught between the US/China rivalry \u2013 is not a good omen for the WHO going forward.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>While the focus has been on what happened between China and the WHO in January, in epidemiological terms the crisis has moved on. Covid-19 has spread fastest and furthest in the US and Europe, through the very rich nations that largely fund and staff the WHO. Before the outbreak, the WHO struggled to get these same nations to prepare for future pandemics. Now the pandemic is here, and they are at the centre of the crisis, the WHO has been unable to keep them following its advice.</p> <p>Richard Horton of the Lancet said that after the WHO declared a public health emergency, \u201ccountries, especially western countries, didn\u2019t listen. Or didn\u2019t seek to understand what was actually taking place in China.\u201d On 5 February, the WHO <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/05-02-2020-us-675-million-needed-for-new-coronavirus-preparedness-and-response-global-plan\" title=\"\">asked for</a> $675m to fund its Coronavirus response through to April. Anthony Costello of UCL said that when he met with Tedros on 4 March, the WHO had received only $1.2m. (Tedros announced last week that the funding goal had finally been reached, around the time the number of worldwide cases passed 1 million.)</p> <p>Even the decision to declare a pandemic on 13 March \u2013 a largely rhetorical distinction, since calling a Pheic already requires WHO members to respond \u2013 was calculated to wake its member states up. In the UK the Premier League was still playing games, and the previous week the US had held primary election contests. \u201cThey declared a pandemic because countries weren\u2019t taking the advice,\u201d said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a professor of global health at the University of Sydney.</p> <p>The WHO stresses that the ideal response to the crisis is relatively simple. Individual states should limit public exposure, especially by tracking and tracing all known cases \u2013 a strategy that worked in South Korea and appears to be working in Germany. On an international level, states should share scientific information and resources. These are the mantras Tedros goes back to in his briefings: \u201cTest test test\u201d and \u201csolidarity solidarity solidarity\u201d.</p> <p>But countries have repeatedly ignored WHO advice. In the UK, the response has been erratic, lurching between the WHO\u2019s norms and its own strategies, such as the now-discredited pursuit of \u201cherd immunity\u201d. The US didn\u2019t recommend school closures or avoiding travel until 16 March. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/sweden-prepares-to-tighten-coronavirus-measures-as-death-toll-climbs\" title=\"\">In Sweden</a>, restaurants are still open.</p> <p>Many wealthy nations have not only pursued their own national strategies for public health, but have also withdrawn from the globalised world of diplomacy and trade that they themselves set up.

  "<p>Working from home, I\u2019m heeding the counsel of master self-isolators. Every spring, male songbirds carve out their own inviolate space. This row of urban semis and small gardens is a constant racket of avian announcements and warnings. It begins with the robin\u2019s plaintive heralding of first light. If I shook off the duvet\u2019s warmth and peeped through the curtains, I\u2019d see him on his regular streetlight songpost. But I tell myself the movement will disturb him, so I lie on to listen for the dunnock. He\u2019s due any minute. I tense with waiting, praying that his predilection for the garden\u2019s low bushes has not meant that he has succumbed to a cat overnight. Ah! There\u2019s his cheery warble. I can get up.</p> <p>Breakfast is both strangely quiet and startlingly noisy. I live under an airport flight path that\u2019s weirdly muted. But the absence of planes magnifies the birdsong. That chaffinch with his individual take on the terminal flourish of his species\u2019 song. Two wrens rattling sabres across a no-go zone that includes our back garden. As the song of the one in the next street starts overlapping with that of two doors up, it\u2019s only a matter of time. Song overlapping or matching is a sign of aggression. Eventually my neighbour\u2019s wren falls silent. I settle to my laptop.</p> <p>Throughout the day, I get more reminders of the importance of physical distancing. The tunes vary, but the message is the same. From the canopy fringing the River Lagan, an elevenses song thrush, his deliberate flutings clearly audible against the traffic\u2019s lowered growl. Cosy house sparrow chatter accompanies lunch, but bursting through are slurred exhortations of a collared dove and a thin exasperation of a goldcrest. In the afternoon, the nearby pedestrian crossing beeps and a great tit responds with furious monosyllables. I wonder who has provoked him, for when I check the window there\u2019s no one to be seen.</p> <p>Evening: our blackbird has assumed his usual position on the chimney opposite. I stop to listen to his gorgeous baritone. And further away, another. And another. The chain of song reminds me of \u201call the birds\u201d of Edward Thomas\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/53744/adlestrop\" title=\"\">Adlestrop</a>. \u201cFarther and farther.\u201d All heeding, all reminding each other: \u201cKeep your distance, keep your distance.\u201d</p>",

Three had been swabbed for Covid-19, but NSW Health and Australian Border Force allowed 2,700 passengers to disembark at 6am and travel home, some on planes interstate, before the test results came in. </p> <h2>A corporate rabbit warren</h2> <p>Deciding who, if anyone, can be held to account for the debacle will involve delving into Carnival\u2019s complex corporate structure.</p> <p>In Australia Carnival trades as Carnival Australia but its status and structure is entirely opaque. Until recently, the NAB director Ann Sherry was billed as Carnival Australia\u2019s chairman, but Carnival says she no longer holds the role.</p> <p>A search of the corporate registry shows there is no Australian company named Carnival Australia. Instead, the words are a business name owned by one of the companies atop Carnival\u2019s globe-spanning corporate tree, the UK-registered Carnival PLC.</p> <p>According to Carnival\u2019s filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the group\u2019s only Australian subsidiary is the oddly named A.C.N. 098 290 834, which has paid-up share capital of $100 and is owned by Carnival PLC.</p> <p>Sherry is not and has never been a director of this company, and Carnival\u2019s spokesman, David Jones, did not respond to specific questions about what it did. Nor did he respond when asked when Sherry ceased to be chairman of Carnival Australia, how she could be an officer of an entity that does not exist and how the group\u2019s local operation was structured.</p> <p>Attempts to contact Sherry have been unsuccessful. There is no suggestion that she played any role in the events surrounding Ruby Princess.</p> <p>At the top of the group sit Carnival PLC and another company called Carnival Corporation, which is registered in the Central American tax haven Panama. The two companies operate together as one entity \u2013 a structure that allows it to be listed on stock exchanges in London and New York.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edfa35396a7dea688a0676d7ac404065cdebd082\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edfa35396a7dea688a0676d7ac404065cdebd082/307_359_5036_3023/1000.jpg\" alt=\"NSW police prepare to board the Ruby Princess to search for evidence on Wednesday evening\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">NSW police prepare to board the Ruby Princess to search for evidence on Wednesday evening.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nathan Patterson/NSW police/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most of Carnival\u2019s fleet of more than 100 ships are registered in tax havens around the world \u2013 including Panama, Bermuda and the Bahamas \u2013 although some are registered in the UK.</p> <p>The two companies file one set of accounts, which show that even before the Covid-19 outbreak stranded its ships around the world it was heavily indebted. Accounts filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission show Carnival lost US$770m ($1.24bn) in the three months to the end of February.</p> <p>It owed more than $10bn that had to be repaid within 12 months, including $4.7bn in customer deposits for cruises that now mostly appear unlikely to happen, and a further $9.7bn that has to be paid back later on.</p> <p>Against the $10bn in current debts, it had just $2.9bn in current assets.</p> <p>To help it survive, last week Carnival went to its shareholders and lenders for an emergency cash injection, raising $6.25bn.
