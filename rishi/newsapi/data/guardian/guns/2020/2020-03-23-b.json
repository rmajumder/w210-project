  "<p>In 1973, Soviet Central Television aired a new drama series called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/sep/11/russias-answer-to-james-bond-did-he-trigger-putins-rise-to-power-seventeen-moments-spring\">Seventeen Moments of Spring</a>, about a Russian secret agent posing as a high-ranking Nazi official called Stierlitz. Stierlitz, James Bond\u2019s Soviet equivalent, was a deliberate propaganda creation \u2013 the book on which the series was based was commissioned by the then head of the KGB, Yuri Andropov. In one concrete sense, the effort was successful: it made 20-year-old Vladimir Putin want to become a spy.</p> <p>The three-part documentary series Putin: A Russian Spy Story (Channel 4) portrays the Russian leader \u2013 who, if you include his contrived second stint as prime minister, has outlasted three US presidents and looks well positioned to see off a few more \u2013 through the prism of his past. It features interviews with those who have worked with him, those who have known him well and those who have run up against him. Some, including Boris Yeltsin\u2019s daughter Tatyana Yumasheva, are speaking on UK television for the first time.</p> <p>The first testimonial about Putin\u2019s character comes from the opposition politician <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/vladimir-kara-murza\">Vladimir Kara-Murza</a>, who has had the misfortune of being poisoned by people he is certain are connected to Putin and his state security apparatus not once, but twice, nearly dying both times. \u201cI have no doubt absolutely that this was done as retribution for my political activities in the Russian opposition,\u201d he says. Kara-Murza sees Putin as a product of his background, specifically of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/08/soldier-spy-more-details-of-vladimir-putins-past-revealed\">his KGB training</a>: \u201cHe\u2019s doing what he was taught to do \u2013 manipulate, lie, recruit, repress. He seems to be quite good at his job.\u201d</p> <p>This first instalment takes us only as far as Putin\u2019s election to the presidency in March 2000, but his early days have plenty of insight to offer. Born in St Petersburg in 1952, Putin was, in the words of the author Alex Goldfarb, \u201ca schoolyard thug\u201d who escaped prison only because of his talent for judo; in those days, the KGB kept an eye out for anyone proficient in martial arts. In 1975, two years after Stierlitz first caught his imagination, Putin joined up.</p> <p>His first posting, to dreary, mid-80s Dresden, came with none of the glamour he had hoped for. To make matters worse, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/09/30-years-after-fall-berlin-wall\">the Berlin wall came down</a> a few years later, taking Putin\u2019s career prospects with it. By the time he returned home, the Soviet Union was on the brink of collapse.</p> <p>Putin resurfaced in the 90s as a fixer for St Petersburg\u2019s democratically elected and prodigiously corrupt mayor, Anatoly Sobchak. One person who encountered him in those days describes him as \u201ca very dry, obviously very humourless man of small stature\u201d.</p> <p>Putin mostly kept himself in the shadows, but a 1992 documentary about the city\u2019s administration features him driving around town accompanied by the soundtrack from Seventeen Moments of Spring. There is also a scene in which the interviewer asks Putin if he takes bribes. Putin answers evasively, but with enough menace that the interviewer apologises for asking.</p> <p>Sobchak found graft and popularity hard to combine. When he lost his bid for re-election in 1996, Putin learned a valuable lesson: never to trust the outcome of an important election to voters. Starting his career over for a second time, Putin packed up his bag of tricks and moved to Moscow.</p> <p>He rose quickly through the ranks to head the FSB, the main successor of the KGB. At the time, Boris Yeltsin could barely walk in a straight line, let alone run the country, and Russia was in search of a leader who could bring stability. Nobody thought it was Putin. \u201cThat was just simply impossible to sort of grasp,\u201d says Mikhail Fishman, the former editor of Russian Newsweek, \u201cbecause we just didn\u2019t know his face.\u201d</p> <p>Yeltsin, however, had benefited from Putin\u2019s skilled use of kompromat: the president\u2019s enemies were entrapped and exposed. Yeltsin made Putin his prime minister and his successor. There was the small matter of getting a charmless nobody elected, but, in a country crying out for order, Putin\u2019s KGB history was not considered a drawback.</p> <p>The most chilling voice to grace this documentary is Putin\u2019s own: prosaic, earnest, flatly recounting his story in his peculiar, dull-but-still-untrustworthy manner. At the end, though, its menace was in its absence. On the night of the March 2000 election victory, a camera crew sat with Yeltsin as he called Putin to congratulate him. But Putin was busy; he would have to call back. The crew waited with Yeltsin, but the call did not come. An hour and a half later, it still had not come. According to those present, it never did.</p>",

The total confirmed death toll rose to 335 on Monday \u2013 a sixfold increase on this time last week.</p> \n<p>\u201cWithout a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope; because there won\u2019t be enough ventilators, enough intensive care beds, enough doctors and nurses,\u201d Johnson said.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd as we have seen elsewhere, in other countries that also have fantastic health care systems, that is the moment of real danger. To put it simply, if too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to handle it - meaning more people are likely to die, not just from coronavirus but from other illnesses as well. So it\u2019s vital to slow the spread of the disease.\u201d</p> \n<p>Over the weekend, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, had appeared to take a much clearer stance on physical distancing than the prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/22/police-could-enforce-social-distancing-rules-says-london-mayor\">telling the capital\u2019s residents</a> to stay at home. \u201cThis isn\u2019t advice, as far as I\u2019m concerned. These are instructions and these are rules that we should all obey to stop people dying,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, welcomed the measures. \u201cSomething did have to change. We\u2019re seeing more and more people lose their lives to this virus and the social distancing measures that the government had announced have simply not been working,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/non-key-workers-tourists-defy-physical-distancing-advice-uk\">beaches full of people</a>, parks full of people, bustling markets. So we were encouraging the PM to go further this morning: we called on him to take emergency action to enforce social distancing, and it looks like that\u2019s what he\u2019s done this evening. So we do support it, and the drastic measures he\u2019s taken tonight.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some in policing are dubious whether they currently have the powers to enforce a lockdown. One source said police were being told they would be given the powers within days, possibly being included in the emergency laws being passed through parliament now.</p> \n<p>It is seen as anathema to the British style of policing by consent, and officers being citizens in uniform: \u201cThere is absolute reluctance,\u201d said another source. \u201cIt\u2019s a total change of policing style.\u201d</p> \n<p>The chair of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, Martin Hewitt, said: \u201cWe are working with the government and other agencies to consider how these new rules can be most effectively enforced.\u201d</p> \n<p>The NPCC quickly squashed suggestions that police would be assisted by troops on the streets or road blocks deployed to enforce the lockdown. A spokesperson told the Guardian: \u201cNeither are being considered in any way.\u201d</p> \n<p>The national chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, John Apter, said: \u201cThe practicalities of policing this lockdown will be challenging \u2026 policing will do all it can to keep the public safe, but we need the public to support us. I ask that the public heed the advice and stay at home unless absolutely necessary.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis will allow police officers to concentrate on keeping the streets safe and deal with all the regular calls we receive. This is about saving lives and supporting our NHS. I ask that the public gives us their support in this time of crisis.\u201d </p> \n<p>Many Tory MPs are worried that No 10 has not moved fast enough to enforce stricter distancing measures, amid public alarm about evidence of people ignoring advice.</p> \n<p>Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, had a stark message for No 10 that a lockdown rule was needed immediately if the UK was to have any chance of avoiding a situation like that in Italy, where the health service is overwhelmed and many hundreds are dying every day.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-how-do-italy-and-the-uk-compare\">Coronavirus: how do Italy and the UK compare?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cIt may be too late to avoid Italy.

Not this week, not tomorrow, but today,\u201d Hunt said.</p> \n<p>As the prime minister\u2019s statement was broadcast, MPs were debating emergency legislation giving the government the powers to ban gatherings, forcibly quarantine suspected sufferers, and compel schools to remain open, for a period of two years.</p> \n<p>Ministers announced on Monday that the legislation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/mps-to-review-coronavirus-emergency-laws-every-six-months\">could be reviewed by MPs every six months</a> \u2013 a significant concession aimed at preventing a potential rebellion.</p> \n<p>Labour had broadly supported the legislation, but sought more regular scrutiny of its sweeping powers. MPs debating measures sat widely dispersed on the green benches of the House of Commons, with many choosing to stay away.</p> \n<p>After the compromise amendment was announced, Labour agreed to allow the legislation to pass without being forced to a vote.</p>",
  "<h2>What do the new restrictions involve?</h2> \n<p>In brief: an Italian-style lockdown to force people to stay at home beyond a small range of very limited circumstances. Under the terms explained by Boris Johnson in his TV address, people will be allowed to leave home only for the following reasons:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>shopping for necessities, as infrequently as possible;</p></li> \n <li><p>one form of exercise a day, such as running or cycling, alone or with household members;</p></li> \n <li><p>for medical or care needs, for example to help a vulnerable person;</p></li> \n <li><p>travelling to and from work, but only if you cannot work from home.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Meeting friends, shopping for anything beyond essentials, and gathering in crowds are now banned.</p> \n<h2>What enforcement action will there be?</h2> \n<p>Police will be able to enforce the rules, and impose fines on people who do not abide by them. Authorities will force the closure of all shops selling non-essential goods, including hair and nail salons, and all markets apart from food markets. Also closed will be libraries, outdoor gyms and playgrounds, and churches or other places of worship. Hotels, B&amp;Bs, campsites and caravan parks will also be closed, apart from to permanent residents or key workers. All public gatherings of more than two people will be banned, except if those people share a household. Also prohibited are all social events such as weddings and baptisms, although funerals will be permitted to take place.</p> \n<h2>How long will it last?</h2> \n<p>At least three weeks. Johnson said that after that point, the government will relax the rules \u201cif the evidence shows we are able to\u201d \u2013 but this is by no means certain.</p> \n<h2>What is this meant to do?</h2> \n<p>The hope is to severely limit the scale of physical and social interaction, and thus slow the spread of the coronavirus so that the growth in cases does not overwhelm the NHS and lead to mass deaths. As Johnson put it: \u201cWithout a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Will it work?</h2> \n<p>This remains to be seen \u2013 and given the time lag between infections and people becoming critically ill, it will be up to two weeks before any benefits are realised. On Monday, Italy recorded a slight reduction in the number of coronavirus deaths, two weeks after it introduced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/coronavirus-italy-prime-minister-country-lockdown\">a national lockdown</a>. So the UK can expect an exponential growth in infections and deaths first, before \u2013 hopefully \u2013 the curve flattens.</p> \n<h2>What has been the situation up till now?</h2> \n<p>There has been a gradual increase in restrictions, going from ministers urging people to work from home if possible and avoid pubs and other crowded places, to schools and nurseries being closed, and then on Friday the forced closure of pubs, clubs, restaurants, gyms and other communal businesses. However, the information on physical distancing has thus far been framed as advice, with Johnson stressing the desire of people to be out of doors.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/cumulative\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>What was the background to the move?</h2> \n<p>Opposition parties and, increasingly, some Conservative MPs have been pushing for tougher restrictions on people\u2019s movement, especially following much-shared photos over the weekend of crowds in national parks and elsewhere. Speaking in the Commons on Monday, the former health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said: \u201cWe must move to lockdown rules now that ban non-essential travel. It\u2019s time not just to ask people to do social distancing, but enforce social distancing rules.\u201d</p> \n<h2>What\u2019s happened in other countries?</h2> \n<p>Many other European countries have taken a lockdown approach, generally a week or so before the UK. Italy saw a ban on almost all movement in the north of the country which was extended, and then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/italian-pm-warns-of-worst-crisis-since-ww2-as-coronavirus-deaths-leap-by-almost-800\">intensified</a>, with only a selection of vital shops and businesses allowed to open, and police checking on people\u2019s movements. Spain and France have taken similar measures.</p> \n<p>The most extreme approach was taken in China, where authorities essentially sealed off 11 million people in Wuhan, where the virus first began spreading, before extending the quarantine zone to take in more than 50 million people. People were kept in apartment blocks, with visitors and almost all outside movements banned. Other measures included compulsory temperature tests, and the placing of those feared to be ill in isolation.</p>",

Coronavirus has already breached the Capitol, where at least two congressmen and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-rand-paul-senator-tests-positive-covid-19\">Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky</a> have tested positive for Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.

But the economic pain was swift. Last week the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/rethinking-the-coronavirus-shutdown-11584659154\">Wall Street Journal editorial board</a> warned that \u201cfederal and state officials need to start adjusting their anti-virus strategy now to avoid an economic recession that will dwarf the harm from 2008-2009\u201d.</p> \n<p>Bret Stephens, a conservative columnist at the New York Times, which Trump monitors closely, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/opinion/coronavirus-data.html\">wrote on Sunday</a> that treating the virus as a threat comparable to the second world war \u201cneeds to be questioned aggressively before we impose solutions possibly more destructive than the virus itself\u201d.</p> \n<p>And Tom Fitton, a conservative commentator known to influence the president, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomfitton/status/1241890169453776902?s=21\">tweeted</a>: \u201cThe consequences of this national shutdown, apart from any pandemic, are dire and will not be materially alleviated by any \u2018stimulus\u2019 and [government] spending. The only stimulus that will work is opening America back up for business.\u201d</p> \n<p>The change came as central bankers warned of unprecedented fallout. The St Louis Fed chief, James Bullard, said America\u2019s GDP could shrink 50%, with unemployment rising to 30% in the second quarter. On Wall Street, Morgan Stanley saw a 30% contraction, driving unemployment to 12.8%.</p> \n<p>The Federal Reserve said: \u201cAggressive efforts must be taken across the public and private sectors to limit the losses to jobs and incomes and to promote a swift recovery once the disruptions abate.\u201d</p> \n<p>The central bank said it was \u201cusing its full range of authorities to provide powerful support for the flow of credit to American families and businesses\u201d.</p> \n<p>Democrats said the $1.8tn proposals were weighted toward a corporate bailout at the expense of workers, hospitals and state and local governments. Republicans claimed Democrats were obstructing the bill in the middle of a national emergency. Both sides said they were confident a deal could still be agreed.</p> \n<p>Trump warned that a rattled American public would take a dim view of an impasse. \u201cThe only reason a deal couldn\u2019t get done is pure politics,\u201d he said on Sunday.</p> \n<p>On Monday the likely Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden, said Trump should \u201cstart acting like\u201d the wartime president he has claimed to be.</p> \n<p>The stalemate in the Senate was felt in the markets, where <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=@DJ.1\">Dow Jones Industrial Average futures</a> dropped more than 600 points.</p> \n<p>In New York, which contributes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/new-york-coronavirus-cases-worldwide-covid19\">close to half of the US tally, 15,168 cases</a>, the governor, Andrew Cuomo, said an estimated 40% to 80% of residents could be infected but echoed the Trump administration\u2019s impatience to reboot the economy.</p> \n<p>\u201cI take total responsibility for shutting off the economy in terms of essential workers but we also have to start to plan the pivot back to economic functionality,\u201d Cuomo told reporters in Albany. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop the economy forever.</p>",

Athletes have led the way on this and the IOC have trailed far them. That has to change.\u201d</p> <p>Warner also urged the IOC to heed the voices of Paralympians who are particularly worried about Covid-19.

  "<p>Difficult and almost impossibly daunting as it may seem, the world is faced with not one but two existential crises and two races against time: the coronavirus and the climate emergency. Dealing with both is going to require extraordinary focus and resolution.</p> <p>Already there is a whiff of political opportunism in the air. Last week, the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babi\u0161, said that the \u20ac1tn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/what-is-the-european-green-deal-and-will-it-really-cost-1tn\">European Green Deal</a>, unveiled and enshrined in law by the European commission barely three weeks ago, should be <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/czech-pm-urges-eu-to-ditch-green-deal-amid-virus/\">put to one side</a>. Member states, he advised, should concentrate all resources on combating a pandemic which, one by one, is shutting down societies and economies. Along with other eastern European states such as Poland, the Czech government has been reluctant to acknowledge the scale of action required to combat global heating, which would have a severe impact on fossil fuel industries in their countries.</p> <p>The extreme urgency of defeating Covid-19 scarcely needs stating. But Mr Babi\u0161\u2019s broader suggestion has been rightly rejected. \u201cThis is one of the very reasons why we presented the climate change law: to avoid that climate action, a generational task, is obfuscated by more pressing and immediate challenges,\u201d said a Brussels spokesman. Frans Timmermans, the Dutch commissioner who is leading the EU response on the climate emergency, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/04/focus-coronavirus-shows-need-climate-law-says-eu-official-frans-timmermans\">has made the same point</a>. </p> <p>The new climate law commits member states to zero emissions by 2050. A stringent new target is also to be set for 2030, which will be enshrined in the law. </p> <p>Mr Timmermans has said that the climate law will act as a \u2018\u201ccompass\u201d for the next 30 years as EU member states seek sustainable forms of growth. In these extraordinary times, local imagination and creativity in developing a sustainable future will be at a premium. There are at least some hopeful signs that such thinking is taking place.</p> <p>In the city of Utrecht, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/forward-thinking-utrecht-builds-car-free-district-for-12000-people\">plans have been unveiled</a> for the largest purpose-built pedestrianised residential area in Europe, which will attempt to harness the virtues of the sharing economy. The Merwede estate will house 12,000 people on a 60-acre site. Transport will be provided by bus and train networks and a shared pool of bikes and cars \u2013 one car for every three families. Schools, shops, sports and medical services will all be within walking distance, and water from the local canal will be used to heat the area. The intention is for the district to become close to energy neutral.</p> <p>Utrecht is one of the fastest-growing cities in the Netherlands and is projected to add 100,000 people to its 350,000 population by 2040. In terms of factoring in a necessary environmental dimension to new construction, Merwede looks like best practice. It is the kind of project that is relatively small scale, but repeatable.

  "<p>As we work to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, all of us \u2013 individuals, families, communities, and the worlds of business, finance and government \u2013 are reminded of the importance of thinking, planning and budgeting for the long term.</p> <p>It is essential to deal with coronavirus as it is \u2013 a global emergency \u2013 but it is clear we must work harder to predict and prepare for the existential risks we face. Not only the threat of pandemics, but the climate crisis and unchecked technological advancements.</p> <p>This week, as parliament scrutinises emergency Covid-19 legislation, Caroline Lucas will introduce a much longer-term proposal, the <a href=\"https://services.parliament.uk/bills/2019-21/wellbeingoffuturegenerationsbill.html\" title=\"\">wellbeing of future generations bill</a>. As co-sponsors of the bill, our aim is to enshrine long-term thinking, and the voices of future generations, at the heart of decision-making.</p> <p>The bill, which is also being steered through the House of Lords by John Bird, is inspired by the model in Wales, where their future generations commissioner is taking long-term thinking into the mainstream. This bill represents the need for cultural shift, which will take time.</p> <p>But with the eyes of future generations upon us, it also presents parliament with an opportunity to act today for tomorrow, and level up opportunity between current and future generations.</p> <p><strong>Caroline Lucas MP</strong> <em>Green,</em> <strong>Bob Blackman MP</strong> <em>Conservative,</em> <strong>Bambos Charalambous</strong> <strong>MP</strong> <em>Labour</em>, <strong>Simon Fell MP</strong> <em>Conservative</em>, <strong>Claire Hanna MP</strong> <em>Social Democratic and Labour party</em>, <strong>Wera Hobhouse MP</strong> <em>Liberal Democrat</em>, <strong>Kevin Hollinrake MP</strong> <em>Conservative</em>, <strong>Anna McMorrin MP</strong> <em>Labour</em>, <strong>Abena Oppong-Asare MP</strong> <em>Labour</em>, <strong>Liz Saville Roberts MP</strong> <em>Plaid Cymru</em>, <strong>Alex Sobel MP</strong> <em>Labour Co-operative</em>, <strong>Philippa Whitford MP</strong> <em>Scottish National party</em></p>",
  "<p>Alex Salmond has been acquitted of all charges of sexual assault, a decision that prompted his allies to suggest he had been the victim of a witch-hunt within the Scottish National party.</p> <p>A jury of eight women and five men at the high court in Edinburgh on Monday found Salmond not guilty of 12 charges of attempted rape, sexual assault and indecent assault after about six hours of deliberations.</p> <p>They came to the uniquely Scottish verdict of not proven on one charge of sexual assault with intent to rape, after hearing nearly nine days of evidence. </p> <p>The outcome \u2013 greeted by Salmond with praise for the judicial system and a call for Scotland\u2019s attention to return to the threat posed by coronavirus \u2013 capped the most significant criminal trial in Scottish political history.</p> <p>It prompted immediate recriminations and demands for resignations within the SNP, which Salmond\u2019s allies and opposition parties said now faced profound questions over its handling of the case. </p> <p>The nine women involved in the charges were all current or former Scottish government officials, or SNP politicians. Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s government has already lost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/13/alex-salmond-awarded-512000-payout-after-botched-investigation\">a judicial review</a> started by Salmond into its handling of an internal review of two misconduct complaints against him in 2018.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"532a0811-acfc-48ec-8aee-cbc5868425c6\"         data-atom-type=\"timeline\"    > </gu-atom> </figure>   <p>Joanna Cherry QC, an influential SNP MP, called for Salmond to be allowed to rejoin the party without delay, and for an independent inquiry into the way the party dealt with the allegations.</p> <p>\u201cSome of the evidence that has come to light both in the judicial review and at this trial raise very serious questions over the process that was employed within the Scottish government to investigate the alleged complaints against Mr Salmond, and I am sorry to say some of the evidence also raises serious question marks over how these complaints were handled by the SNP,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Kenny MacAskill, formerly Salmond\u2019s justice secretary and now an SNP MP, welcomed the verdict, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KennyMacAskill/status/1242102937800904709?s=20\">tweeting</a> that he was \u201cdelighted\u201d for Salmond and that some resignations were \u201cnow required\u201d.</p> <p>After the verdicts were read out, Salmond displayed little emotion, but thanked court security officers and the judge, Lady Dorrian, Scotland\u2019s second most senior judge.</p> <p>Speaking outside court afterwards Salmond said his faith in the judicial system had been \u201cmuch reinforced\u201d. Thanking his friends, family and supporters for standing by him throughout the trial, he said his own \u201cnightmare\u201d could not compare with the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>After thanking his \u201cexceptional\u201d legal team, Salmond said he planned to release further information about the case at a later date.</p> <p>\u201cAs many of you will know, there was certain evidence I would like to have seen led in this trial but for a variety of reasons we weren\u2019t able to do so. At some point that information, that fact and that evidence will see the light of day but it won\u2019t be this day, for a very good reason,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The SNP leader and first minister, Sturgeon, said the verdicts \u201cmust be respected\u201d, but added that her focus was currently on steering the country through the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>\u201cI am a strong believer in a vigorous, robust, independent judicial process where complaints of this nature, if they come forward, are properly and thoroughly investigated, due process takes its course and a court reaches a decision, and that\u2019s what has happened today,\u201d she said. \u201cI have no doubt that there will be further discussion around this issue in due course, in the fullness of time \u2013 and I will welcome that. But that time is not now.\u201d</p> <p>In pre-trial court hearings, Salmond\u2019s defence lawyer, Gordon Jackson QC, had told Dorrian there were text messages between complainants, Scottish government officials and SNP officials that raised questions about an orchestration of some of the allegations against his client.</p> <p>Jackson sought to get some of that material admitted into evidence. In January he told Dorrian the defence believed \u201cthere was [a] concerted effort made by people in the government to influence this process, to get it as best they could in terms of criminal prosecution\u201d.</p> <p>He alleged those efforts were motivated by revenge because Salmond had won his judicial review in January 2019, after the Scottish government admitted it had botched an internal inquiry into two sexual harassment complaints against him.</p> <p>One of those texts included one sent by Leslie Evans, as permanent secretary the Scottish government\u2019s top civil servant, to another official after they lost the judicial review, which read: \u201cWe may have lost the battle, but we will win the war.\u201d</p> <p>Dorrian refused to allow much of that material to be used in court but allowed other messages to be admitted as evidence.</p> <p>Salmond was originally charged with 14 offences but was formally acquitted of one charge, a 10th sexual assault charge, after the prosecution withdrew it halfway through the trial.</p> <p>The not proven verdict on sexual assault with attempt to rape stops short of a finding of not guilty but leaves the accused innocent in the eyes of the law. Two jurors were discharged by the judge on Monday morning, reducing the size of the jury from 15 to 13.</p> <p>Alex Prentice QC, as he summed up the case for the prosecution, told the jury Salmond was a sexual predator who exploited his power to prey on younger, subordinate women. </p> <p>Jackson disputed Prentice\u2019s account. He told the jury there were no direct witnesses to the alleged assaults, and that inconsistencies and contradictions repeatedly cropped up in the evidence.</p> <p>\u201cThis comes out of a political bubble with no real independent support of any kind. I said already it smelt and I don\u2019t apologise for that one bit,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the same pattern over and over and over again. It\u2019s scary.\u201d</p> <p>The Scottish Conservative leader, Jackson Carlaw, said the verdicts raised further \u201cserious questions\u201d for the SNP, the Scottish government and Sturgeon, which would be investigated by a forthcoming Scottish parliament inquiry.</p> <p>Pauline McNeill, the Scottish Labour equalities spokeswoman, said the trial was extremely traumatic for all involved, but added: \u201cThe verdict of this trial does not take away from the serious concerns about the Scottish government\u2019s handling of this. We would expect questions about this to be fully explored during parliamentary scrutiny of this.\u201d</p> <p>Rape Crisis Scotland thanked the complainants for appearing in court. \u201cRegardless of the verdict, the detailed descriptions and court coverage has been triggering and very hard for many people,\u201d the group said.</p>",
  "<p>From the fatalistic blues of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hx4gdlfamo\">The Gambler</a> to the mournful lament of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SDVkdcO8ts\">Lucille</a>, Kenny Rogers sang songs full of emotion, courage, drama and heartache. Although his cautionary Americana fables didn\u2019t always have a happy ending, the raspy-voiced musician delivered them with more warmth than a shot of bourbon around a campfire, somehow ensuring that you always ended up smiling.</p> <p>But the celebrated country singer, who has died of natural causes at the age of 81, wasn\u2019t just great at telling stories through song. He also used photography, releasing several books, and receiving an honorary degree from the Professional Photographers of America (PPA). \u201cHe\u2019s obviously well-known as an entertainer,\u201d said PPA president Ralph Romaguera when giving Rogers his award in 2014, \u201cbut he truly is a remarkably talented photographer, too.\u201d</p> <p>Covering landscapes and portraits, Rogers\u2019 images shift between giddily capturing the larger-than-life personas of such friends as <a href=\"https://br.pinterest.com/pin/211174959063151/\">Ray Charles</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/26/why-dolly-parton-is-having-a-millennial-moment\">Dolly Parton</a>, to documenting the natural beauty of America\u2019s vast countryside.

The camera also became a way to stave off boredom while touring America and bringing his signature brand of accessibly nostalgic country pop to fan-filled arenas. \u201cI only worked an hour a day,\u201d <a href=\"http://sportsandentertainmentnashville.com/kenny-rogers-the-photographer/\">Rogers said of life on the road</a> in 2014. \u201cThat meant I had 23 hours with nothing to do.\u201d</p> <p>In that interview, with Sports &amp; Entertainment Nashville, he added: \u201cSo we\u2019d get up in the morning, get in the car, and drive around whatever city we were in and ask the locals whether there was anything good to shoot. A lot of the time they\u2019d say, \u2018No, I\u2019ve lived here 30 year and there\u2019s nothing.\u2019 And then you\u2019d turn round the corner and you\u2019d find Niagara Falls.\u201d</p> <p>Although he loved taking portraits of his fourth wife, the model Marianne Gordon, Rogers clearly saw photography as much more than just a hobby. At the height of his fame in the 1980s and 90s, he found time for private lessons with acclaimed photographers, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/jul/15/guardianobituaries1\">Yousuf Karsh</a> to John Sexton. \u201cKarsh taught me how to capture the personality of a celebrity by making them feel at ease,\u201d said Rogers. \u201cWhen you see them totally relaxed, that\u2019s when you shoot.

His equipment grew more sophisticated, too. He moved from a Linhof Master Technika 4x5-inch to larger-format cameras capable of producing more arresting 8x10 negatives. The Thumb, one of his most striking shots, captures a digit-like mountaintop in bold black and white. With the moon hovering low in the sky and the stark rock outlines, it resembles a still from a science-fiction movie, lit with dark mystique. </p> <p>Like many of Rogers\u2019s environmental photographs, it has real depth, accentuating the shadows. It\u2019s as if he was suggesting that America, even at its most beautiful, had something sinister lurking in the darkness. You could say the same about many of his songs, particularly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/27/peter-hook-soundtrack-of-my-life\">Ruby, Don\u2019t Take Your Love to Town</a>.</p> <p>His celebrity portraits are particularly vivid. In 1987, Rogers published Your Friends and Mine, full of portraits of superstars from Elizabeth Taylor to Michael Jackson. He also photographed the likes of Willie Nelson and Tammy Wynette for his 2005 photo book This Is My Country. Most of these celebrities looks at ease and relaxed, acutely aware that the person behind the camera was one of them and had no agenda.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"743de556ccf5ec760b08e07876ba4b2835c5a88c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/743de556ccf5ec760b08e07876ba4b2835c5a88c/0_0_3000_2024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It\u2019s such a great trick\u2019 ...

Rogers at the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Diamond/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That said, Rogers\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MichaelJackson/comments/fmgl3v/a_dear_friend_and_longtime_defender_of_michaels/\">shot of Michael Jackson</a> awkwardly clutching his pet chimpanzee Bubbles like a ventriloquist\u2019s dummy feels as if it was intended to be a little more ironic than his usual work. Here, arguably, Rogers captured the unnerving bombast of Jackson\u2019s eccentric celebrity more clearly than just about any other photographer.</p> <p>One of Rogers\u2019s biggest lessons came from the American portrait photographer George Hurrell, who taught the singer how to create a connection with his subjects that would spill over into the final product.</p> <p>\u201cHe came down to my place in Georgia and spent some time with me,\u201d Rogers <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jllVqUaWRg4\">told the Associated Press.</a> \u201cGeorge said to me, \u2018I am gonna tell you a trick. I call it the stolen moment!\u2019 He said to talk to your subject about the happiest day of their life and also the saddest day of their life. Just as they respond to the question, you take the picture. It means they are not posing, but rather being who they truly are. It\u2019s honestly such a great trick.\u201d</p> <p>Often, when celebrities announce that they enjoy taking photographs, we brace ourselves for a dire, staged selfie or shot of a lurid pink swimming pool. Rogers was proof that, occasionally, a celebrity could be just as arresting behind the camera as they were in front of it.</p> <p>Last June, Rogers posted one of his <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/ByvOUxGBhir/\">photos to Instagram</a>, something he did regularly in his later years. Taken while on tour, it deals with all the things the country singer seemed to be most fond of: epic mountaintops, gorgeous if slightly eerie moonlight, and trees that stand like gods. It\u2019s easy to imagine a silver-haired Rogers, probably in a cowboy hat, smiling behind the camera, just taking it all in.</p>",
  "<p>Crown court trials across England and Wales were suspended or collapsed on Monday as judges attempted to find safer ways for juries and lawyers to conduct hearings.</p> <p>There have been suggestions, including from the Ministry of Justice, that courts move to handling urgent work only during the coronavirus crisis, but no one has defined what types of cases that might involve.</p> <p>A statement issued by the lord chief justice, Lord Burnett of Maldon, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/mar/23/jury-trials-put-on-hold-in-england-and-wales-coronavirus\">said hearings were being paused</a> while measures that respected the need for physical distancing were considered to prevent infection spreading.</p> <p>Burnett\u2019s decision followed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/mar/22/uk-justice-ministry-urged-to-restrict-court-hearings-to-most-urgent-coronavirus\">complaints about the safety of continuing with physical court hearings </a>while much of the rest of the the country shuts down.</p> <p>The head of the judiciary said: \u201cA review of the arrangements in our courts is called for. I have decided that we need to pause jury trials for a short time to enable appropriate precautions to be put in place.</p> <p>\u201cMy unequivocal position is that no jury trials or other physical hearings can take place unless it is safe for them to do so.\u201d Judges should conduct cases using remote technology such as telephone and video links where possible he said. </p> <p>His early morning announcement stopped many hearings from resuming or starting. The pattern across the country was not uniform, however, because decisions about whether individual cases should go ahead has been placed in the hands of local judges. </p> <p>The jury at the Old Bailey trial of three teenagers accused of the murder of PC Andrew Harper was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-pc-andrew-harper-trial-jury-dismissed\">discharged after a third juror went into isolation over the weekend</a>.</p> <p>In a sign that hearings are unlikely to resume in any number for a long time, Caroline Goodwin QC, the chair of the Criminal Bar Association (CBA), said: \u201cThe political pressure to keep courts open is unacceptable, not least given their previous neglect and the lack of concern for any of the endemic delays or issues in the criminal justice system.</p> <p>\u201cWithin the recent past there was no care for the removal of cases from the criminal lists. Now there is an unacceptable pressure to press on regardless. That in simple terms is wrong, is dangerous and fails to exercise any duty of care to court users. When, and only when, it is safe, can hearings be resumed.\u201d</p> <p>Lawyers for the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, have signalled that they will make a bail application for him on Wednesday at Westminster magistrates court on the grounds that he is vulnerable to the Covid-19 outbreak in Belmarsh prison where he is on remand. His extradition appeal is part-heard.</p> <p>The chair of the Bar Council in England and Wales, Amanda Pinto QC, issued fresh guidance for barristers urging them to stay away from court unless instructed otherwise. \u201cFor those who are unclear whether they should go to court today or in the immediate future the default position is to stay away unless yours is one of those rare hearings which must be in person and the court tells you to go in,\u201d she said. </p> <p>\u201cListing officers in every crown court are now working through their lists for today and the next few days to identify the hearings that will and will not happen in person.\u201d</p> <p>Elsewhere defendants and lawyers were still expected at court. The CBA retweeted a comment from one barrister saying: \u201cBusiness as usual at Stratford youth court. No guidance on what \u2018urgent\u2019 means. No directive to adjourn bail cases. Parents and young people and advocates waiting outside court room. Not safe for anyone here.\u201d</p> <p>Another barrister, Oliver Kirk, tweeted: \u201cReport from the coal face: People literally risking their lives and those of us all to come to court for offences over a year old to be given a trial date next year.\u201d</p> <p>The FDA union, which represents CPS prosecutors, called for more detailed guidance. \u201cWe have been calling on the MoJ to suspend all but the most urgent cases in order to protect the health and safety of everyone who works in or uses the courts, so this [announcement by Burnett] is a welcome development,\u201d the FDA\u2019s national officer, Steven Littlewood, said.</p> <p>\u201cWe are also pleased to note the commitment to appropriate health and safety measure in courts. Our members have repeatedly raised concerns about a lack of proper social distancing as well as insanitary conditions at courts, including a lack of soap and hand sanitiser.</p> <p>\u201cBut for these problems to be rectified and to ensure the health and safety of those at court a full risk assessment carried out before anyone is expected to attend. We are calling for this to take place and for the guidance to require this.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Let\u2019s be clear: these are weird and scary times. It\u2019s strange, amid all the ominous health concerns and precarity, to care about television. But it is, as untold millions retreat to their homes for at least the next couple weeks, a uniquely boon time for streaming content. So it is that today, in a week of unprecedented excuses to binge soapy genre TV, Netflix dropped Freud, the streamer\u2019s ridiculous \u201chistorical\u201d fiction thriller which recasts the legendary psychologist as a coked-up, seance-enthused witch hunter who uses hypnosis to solve crimes in 19th-century Vienna. Because \u2026why not?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/20/self-made-review-octavia-spencer\">Self Made review \u2013 Octavia Spencer sparkles in inspiring Netflix drama</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The eight-part show, created by Marvin Kren, Stefan Brunner and Benjamin Hessler, keeps things (somewhat) grounded for about half an episode \u2013 the doctor, played as a tightly wound and righteous young striver by Robert Finster, practices his dramatically lit hypnotism routine on his housekeeper, Lenore (Brigitte Kern). And it is a routine \u2013 debt-riddled and with hypnotism skills lagging far behind his complex theories of psychological repression, the good doctor has resorted to training Lenore to perform a trance for his colleagues at his academy to prove the \u201chaughty fools\u201d of the establishment wrong. An outsider for his theories of the unconscious and his status as a \u201cJewish charlatan\u201d, Freud is anxious to prove his worth, most especially to his long-distance fiancee, Marta, whose mother disapproves of his \u201cmedical\u201d practice (as conveyed via clunky voiceover while Freud pens love letters). He also has less professional priorities, as evidenced by the line, and I quote, \u201cPerhaps you would like some cocaine?\u201d before the intro rolls.</p> <p>Things swiftly take a turn for the weird, when a mutilated prostitute lands, literally, on Freud\u2019s desk, courtesy of Inspectors Kiss (Georg Friedrich) and Poschacher (Christoph F Krutzler). Kiss, a gravelly voiced, archetypically repressed man, immediately suspects Georg von Lichtenberg, his former military superior, in part because he knew the woman, and in part because Kiss is intimately aware of his sadistic streak; the inspector\u2019s lingering trauma, in the form of a cramped shooting hand, from the heinous orders he obeyed under Von Lichtenberg\u2019s command offer Freud a chance to demonstrate that his idea of the embodied, active unconscious has some merit.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQfcZ9Ak2nU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VQfcZ9Ak2nU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Freud slips from weird into downright ludicrousness when the doctor attends a seance hosted by Count Viktor (Philipp Hochmair), styled as Green Day crossed with Viennese nobility, and his mysterious wife, Countess Sophia (Anja Kling). Their ward, Fleur Salome (Ella Rumpf), a Hungarian medium who looks uncannily like Eva Green, suffers a bad trip into the alternate realm, one haunted by a blood-stained demon; particularly susceptible to Freud\u2019s amateur hypnotism and charms, she becomes his key patient in the quest to explain the unconscious \u2026 and partner in a steamy affair.</p> <p>The plot takes about two episodes to cohere into any sense, by which point it\u2019s clear the mastermind of several violent, madness-induced crimes is Countess Sophia, whose hypnotic powers dwarf Freud\u2019s and rely on a psychosexual combination of touch and verbal manipulation. As Countess Sophia\u2019s plans swell from a young girl\u2019s kidnapping to a confusing plot sowing chaos in the Austrian state, the show sinks deeper and deeper into engaging-enough lunacy. How much you enjoy this depends on how much you enjoy pulpy, gratuitous Netflix shows which make no claims to prestige TV or the concept of restraint. Among the things Freud throws at the wall: blood-soaked nude figures, a torture chamber deep in the canal tunnels, hypnotism-induced seizures, disastrous duels, Egyptian mummies as props, a cannibalistic opera singer, use of the shaky cam, dinner parties frozen in mid-air, and, naturally, Freud vomiting a particularly large dose of his cocaine beverage.</p> <p>There are plenty of subplots here, most notably a political insurrection against the emperor whose logic is difficult to follow and ultimately irrelevant; the main show is the slurp of creepy, disturbing manifestations of repressed psyches coalescing into, by the later episodes, a nonsensical yet amusing horror show.</p> <p>Like other absurd revisions of famous stories, such as Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter or Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, Freud is arguably better the more it leans into its ridiculousness. There is little entertainment value in watching Freud stumble his way to a theory of hypnosis or deal with his own repressed demons and feelings of worthlessness; it is, however, baseline compelling, in a mindless, \u201cI\u2019m stuck inside and would like to plunge my brain into inane nonsense\u201d type of way, to watch Freud and Fleur piece together Countess Sophia\u2019s plan through a series of unsettling trips into hypnosis and horror.</p> <p>All of which is to say: whatever suppressed pulp instinct you might have during this time of world crisis, it probably gets some airtime during this show. Which makes the concept of a review irrelevant \u2013 you either have an appetite for this kind of mindless stew of drunk history or you don\u2019t. And given the upside-down surreality of the real world right now, a coked-up Freud might be a deceptively hot ticket.</p> <ul> <li><p>Freud is now available on Netflix</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>Moira Salmond has long been one of the most enigmatic figures in Scottish public life. Married to one of the country\u2019s most famous political leaders for nearly 40 years, she has stayed resolutely in the background, and prefers it there.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m no Glenys Kinnock,\u201d she said in her first \u2013 and only \u2013 media interview, with the Sunday Post in 1990. \u201cI married Alex, not politics. That\u2019s his life and I am happy to be in the background. I share his convictions, but one politician in the family is quite enough.\u201d</p> <p>Other than a few brief appearances with Salmond at election counts, there have been no election broadcast cameos or lifestyle features at their detached period home, a converted former mill in Strichen, Aberdeenshire, where she once reared rare Muscovy ducks.</p> <p>She is said to have been defiant about the allegations against her husband, furious that former allies and colleagues turned against him in a case that ultimately resulted in his acquittal on all charges. Yet, now 82, she remained in Strichen during his court appearances, appearing only once by his side on the final day of his trial in Edinburgh. Instead, Salmond\u2019s sisters Gail and Margaret, and his former office manager Isobel Zambonini, accompanied him as he walked into court for hearings.</p> <p>Rumours circulated for years within the Scottish National party and political circles that Salmond had a series of discreet affairs but it never became a public or political issue.</p> <p>At a press conference in August 2018 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/24/alex-salmond-calls-sexual-misconduct-claims-ridiculous\">Salmond admitted he was no saint</a>, and, as part of his defence, claimed to jurors he had a consensual \u201cliaison\u201d with one complainer and a \u201csleepy cuddle\u201d with another.</p> <p>Consistently shy of making public appearances in the UK, <a href=\"https://www.scotsman.com/news/alex-salmond-biography-leading-lady-driving-force-behind-first-minister-2442022\">Moira</a><a href=\"https://www.scotsman.com/news/alex-salmond-biography-leading-lady-driving-force-behind-first-minister-2442022\"> has rarely provoked media interest</a>. But there was one notable occasion.</p> <p>As Andy Murray celebrated winning Wimbledon in 2013, she pulled a large saltire from her handbag as she and her husband sat behind the then prime minister, David Cameron, in the royal box. The couple held it high, reportedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/08/andy-murray-i-did-not-like-alex-salmond-scottish-flag-waving-wimbledon\">to </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/08/andy-murray-i-did-not-like-alex-salmond-scottish-flag-waving-wimbledon\">the tennis player\u2019s irritation</a>.</p> <p>During Salmond\u2019s seven years as first minister, his wife\u2019s official duties in Scotland were rare and off camera. To her apparent delight, she accompanied him on their annual overnight stays with the Queen during her September holidays at Balmoral, but rarely stayed at Bute House, the first minister\u2019s elegant but unhomely official residence in Edinburgh.</p> <p>She was given her own programme of events when she accompanied her husband on his first visit to the US as first minister in 2008, and again on trips in 2011 and 2012 to Dubai, Qatar and Abu Dhabi.</p> <p>Out of the public gaze, Moira became a significant presence in the SNP in Aberdeenshire, helping at branch events and fundraisers, taking part in Salmond\u2019s private dinners with newspaper editors, friendly business leaders and political allies.</p> <p>She has been his guide, confidante and at times, political strategist. Salmond told one interviewer in 2007 her influence on him was \u201cvery substantial. She tells me not to take myself too seriously.\u201d One observer recalls Salmond cadging a cigarette at a party event and pleading like a naughty child: \u201cDon\u2019t tell Moira.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>All the things that were taken to be self-evident a couple of weeks ago are no longer so. That is how fast this epidemic is spreading. Having known liars in charge of telling us the truth \u2013 whether Boris Johnson or Donald Trump \u2013 does not help. \u201cTruth is mighty and will prevail,\u201d said Mark Twain, before adding: \u201cThere is nothing wrong with this, except it ain\u2019t so.\u201d</p> <p>It certainly ain\u2019t so and what we are seeing is mass cognitive dissonance. That is the stress produced when people seek some kind of consistency between how they think life is and what we may call reality. It is really discomforting to be given information that does not fit in with your beliefs. This results in denial or in justification for actions that do not fit the situation. Sometimes we may simply refuse to believe what we are told, attempting to resolve the contradiction between our inner and outer worlds by believing whatever we want to believe. This is precisely why behavioural changes are so hard to make and why messages have to be clear. Cognitive dissonance is coming from the top down, as well as from the bottom up. There is little difference between a government reluctance to announce a lockdown and people having barbecues together in the parks. It is way easier to blame all this on Johnson\u2019s adviser, Dominic Cummings, than to see it as a collective political failure. If anyone needs to \u201ctake back control\u201d it is each of us now.</p> <p>Yet the force to accept what is happening is strong in some, much weaker in others. The professional heretics say all this talk of the need for a lockdown is rubbish: <a href=\"https://www.spiked-online.com/2020/03/17/the-luxury-of-apocalypticism/\" title=\"\">Brendan O\u2019Neill</a>, the man from Spiked who wants his pint, despite the risk that the people who serve it may become ill; and my old mucker, Mail on Sunday columnist Peter Hitchens, who <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-8138675/PETER-HITCHENS-shutting-Britain-REALLY-right-answer.html\" title=\"\">once hurt his shoulder but didn\u2019t die</a>, and is now reading an awful lot into that fact. Such people make their living from disputing the truth. They are so edgy, their truth may mean people dying.</p> <p>A belief in one\u2019s own invincibility is now out of time and out of touch. These guys remind me of those fools who die taking selfies as they fall off a cliff. I am not invincible either, which is tough, right? My world has been shaken. I am as anti-authoritarian as they come, but I have to square that mindset with one essential word: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/italian-pm-warns-of-worst-crisis-since-ww2-as-coronavirus-deaths-leap-by-almost-800\" title=\"\">Italy</a>. That is what makes me think <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/pressure-grows-boris-johnson-impose-uk-coronavirus-lockdown\" title=\"\">the state has to lock us down</a>.</p> <p>Many things we thought were true a few weeks ago no longer are. Here are a few. Borrowing loads of money was bad for the state and now it isn\u2019t. Being a shelf stacker or a carer was a lowly job fit only for migrants \u2013 now those jobs are recognised to be important. Rail services can\u2019t be trusted to run themselves; nationalisation is suddenly uncontroversial. The free market cannot provide.</p> <p>We have decided that private hospitals have to be made public. That school isn\u2019t really about learning; a lot of it is just childcare and lessons can be done in an hour a day. Why have we been testing our kids into a state of self-harm all these years, and why have qualified teachers been doing childcare? Shopping is not the meaning of life. The BBC is quite good. Social media may help as well as hinder. Celebrities are the most dispensable group ever. (Literally no one cares about their incessant health updates.) Our prisons are full of people who don\u2019t need to be there <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-uk-prisons-releasing-harmless-staff\" title=\"\">and could be let out</a>. My list grows as my world shrinks.</p> <p>Some are adjusting more quickly than others to the new world. Others hanker not for what was, even, but for a fantasy past and future: the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/corbynmuststay?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag\" title=\"\">#Corbynmuststay</a> has been cropping up on Twitter.</p> <p>The massive package of state intervention may not be enough, sure, but right now we are having to reconfigure what is left and what is right. The boxes we put ideas and ideologies into have disintegrated. Lifelong beliefs are hard to rethink. To me, rich people have always socially distanced and are still doing so \u2013 I don\u2019t want the Queen addressing me from a castle. I care about women trapped in tiny flats with tiny kids.</p> <p>Nor do I want more tips from freelance writers about how to self-isolate and work from home effecti vely \u2013 we were never normal in the first place and while we might be happy on our own, some people need to see other people. I can see from the experiences of my own family that we all have different needs. Each of us will have a meltdown at different times in different ways. As more and more people we know get ill and die, our own mortality draws closer. That\u2019s my emotional truth.</p> <p>Like many over the past few years I have quoted Antonio Gramsci a lot. Why? Because the man from Sardinia understood the work of culture. Marxists have always been disappointed by the working class, who continually vote against their own self-interest. Gramsci explained how this happened, through his concept of hegemony. The famous quote is: \u201cThe crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.\u201d</p> <p>Some of us have used this vaguely either about the end of capitalism or the end of the left, but I don\u2019t think any of us realised how morbid the symptoms would actually be. You can talk about austerity and the climate crisis, but neither has prompted the sudden reordering of the world in the way Covid-19 has.</p> <p>We now have to sit with the fact that opposite things can be true. That to help others right now is to be alone. That is how the new can be born. This is the huge psychological effort for all of us, but I say: distance or death. That is the stark choice. We need to spell it out.</p> <p>\u2022 Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist</p>",

She is careful not to catch the bug as she self-isolates in her seventh-floor flat in east London, but like many of the millions of elderly people now being told to severely limit their activities, she has lived through a far greater catastrophe: the second world war.</p> <p>\u201cI can remember the sounds of the doodlebugs going over,\u201d she said as she contemplated her second week in almost complete lockdown, one of 7.8 million people in the UK aged 70 or older who, regardless of medical conditions, are being told by the government to self-isolate.</p> <p>German motorised bombs flew over London as she and her family listened to the radio and \u201cas soon as the sound stopped we were all sitting there petrified because you didn\u2019t know if you were underneath it.\u201d One day, they were and the device blew out the doors and the windows of her home. \u201cA virus is nothing compared to that,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Comparisons between the current public health crisis and wartime are much-discussed among the generation most vulnerable to Covid-19. But as Public Health England instructs them to avoid non-essential use of public transport, avoid gatherings in public or with friends and family and only use telephones or go online to contact GPs, different problems are emerging.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the lack of exercise that worries me,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I did go out [to the shop and to the bank], the walking got to me. I lost the use of my legs. I need to be more disciplined and do exercise at home, but I feel such a ninny.\u201d</p> <p>Maureen thinks she is part of a rump of the elderly who she fears are being overlooked \u2013 millions of over-70s who would normally fend for themselves, but who are made vulnerable by the latest isolation orders. They are not necessarily among the 1.2 million of the most vulnerable who the NHS is now instructing to stay at home at all times and avoid any face-to-face contact for a period of at least 12 weeks.</p> <p>\u201cThe frail are well looked after,\u201d said Maureen, who had an active life as a national organiser for the Green party and committee member for the British Computer Society. \u201cIt\u2019s the ones who aren\u2019t very frail who have fallen through the cracks because we are left to look after ourselves, which we\u2019re proud to be able to do. But we don\u2019t get much advice or help.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Goulden, director of The Silver Line, a helpline for the elderly that has been inundated with callers concerned about coronavirus, urges \u201ceveryone to pick up the phone and check on your older family, friends and neighbours and see how you can help\u201d.</p> <p>Patricia, 84, hunkering down with her husband, Bill, 94, at their home in Leicester, has also been comparing the coronavirus crisis to her wartime childhood in Sheffield.</p> <p>\u201cI do feel scared, but I was also scared when the bombers were going over,\u201d she said. \u201cOur house was bombed. The planes came down over the moor. I remember being in the garden [where they were sheltering] and wondering, \u2018Where\u2019s the house?\u2019 I don\u2019t want to be ill and I don\u2019t want to die. But I don\u2019t want to start panicking about coronavirus.\u201d</p> <p>Patricia was also active and used to swim five times a week. Last week she only swam once (she felt safe as there were only five other people in the pool). She has been shopping in Aldi, wearing gloves and wrapping a scarf over her mouth.</p> <p>\u201cI have always been independent and I am not being silly,\u201d she said. \u201cI am cleaning every day with disinfectant wipes, cleaning all the doorhandles.\u201d</p> <p>Both Patricia and Maureen struggle with the idea of volunteers doing their shopping. \u201cI like to pick what I like to pick,\u201d said Patricia. \u201cThey won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Maureen. \u201cOld people are very proud. We are a grumpy old bunch, but we have reason to be grumpy. People treat us like children.\u201d</p> <p>For now, the elderly and their families are taking it one day at a time. The charity Age UK is encouraging families to \u201cconnect and reassure older people in this uncertain time\u201d not just by phone, text and video calls, but by sending letters, postcards and pictures from grandchildren too.</p> <p>\u201cPicking up shopping, prescriptions or running errands could help to alleviate any worries and concerns they may have about how they\u2019re going to cope,\u201d said Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK.</p> <p>\u201cDoing what we can to encourage older people to stay physically active at home and ensuring they remain connected and included will be essential. This could mean making sure people have what they need to keep going with their hobbies and interests, like wool if they are knitters.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Maureen has been trying to reach out and help her friends by sending web links to online courses that they might find diverting.

  "<p>At 8am on Monday, just as thousands of English and Welsh citizens set off for their local crown court to serve on a jury, the lord chief justice <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JudiciaryUK/status/1241984457332187140?s=20\">announced</a> that no new jury trials would take place.</p> <p>This move, fiercely resisted to date by the justice secretary and lord chancellor, Robert Buckland, is long overdue.

Once selected for a jury panel, they pile into a windowless courtroom and sit next to each other for five hours a day. At lunch they mingle with the hundred or so other jurors in the building. At the conclusion of the trial, they shuffle into a tiny, unventilated retiring room, where they make a decision that could ultimately determine whether somebody spends time in prison.</p> <p>They do so in filthy court conditions in which the lack of hot water, soap and paper towels is widespread; where broken hand dryers, leaking toilets, burst pipes and crumbling roofs and walls are par for the course. These are conditions that, in the good times, we in the courts simply accept as a permanent feature of a chronically underfunded justice system \u2013 but which in the current climate present a patently alarming proposition.</p> <p><strong> </strong>Criminal courts are a petri dish. Scores of defendants are piled into waiting areas. Most travel by public transport; some travel in \u201csweatbox\u201d security vans from our <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/bedford-prison-hmp-rats-inspection-urgent-notification-suicides-violence-drugs-a8739421.html\">infested</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49324718\">overcrowded</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/first-uk-prisoner-with-covid-19-confirmed-at-strangeways-manchester\">virus-ri</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/first-uk-prisoner-with-covid-19-confirmed-at-strangeways-manchester\">dden</a> prisons. Defendants and their families mix with their barristers, who mix with court staff, who mix with witnesses, judges and jurors, who mix with other witnesses, judges and jurors. Courtrooms vary in size and style \u2013 in some of our more antique Victorian courts, jurors are squeezed on to hard wooden benches without an inch between them,<strong> </strong>let alone the two metres recommended by the government to ensure social distancing during the coronavirus crisis. In the fairly typical court I was in last week, the defendants, barristers, clerk, usher, witness box and jury box were all within two metres of each other.</p> <p> It is telling that in his announcement yesterday, despite the chipper assurances by Her Majesty\u2019s Courts &amp; Tribunal Service that it was \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HMCTSgovuk/status/1241744515028975616?s=20\">putting extra effort into court [and] tribunal cleaning</a>\u201d, the lord chief justice specifically cited the need for \u201cbasic hygiene arrangements\u201d in the courts.</p> <p><strong> </strong>By insisting that the shortest trials go ahead, the government has ensured the highest possible turnover of strangers coming into contact with each other. Over the past few days I have been flooded with messages from terrified jurors, witnesses and court staff aghast that, at a time when the government is frantically urging social distancing because \u201c<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-and-for-vulnerable-people/guidance-on-social-distancing-for-everyone-in-the-uk-and-protecting-older-people-and-vulnerable-adults\">infections spread easily in closed spaces where people gather together</a>\u201d, they are being required by law to expose themselves to such conditions. In a closing speech last week, one of my colleagues thanked the jury for their dedication. One of the jurors burst into tears.</p> <p>This situation has been appallingly unfair to all concerned. How on earth can jurors be expected to concentrate on their task? How can any defendant or victim of crime have faith that the 12 people trying their case are paying full attention to the nuances of the evidence, when the jury are burdened with the knowledge that, as a direct result of their service, they, or someone they love, could die?</p> <p>And anyway, contrary to MoJ dictums, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/legalhackette/status/1239626936357474305?s=20\">the courts have not been \u201coperating normally</a>\u201d. Judges are self-isolating; defendants, jurors and witnesses are staying at home as they break out with symptoms; and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-51932469\">trials are collapsing</a> all over the country. The Witness Service, the organisation responsible for looking after witnesses at court, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-victim-and-witness-services\">has withdrawn its volunteers</a>. Many crown court judges have made no secret of their disdain for what the MoJ would wish to term a \u201cstrategy\u201d, but which more closely resembles a tribute act to Monty Python\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmInkxbvlCs\">Black Knight</a>, chirpily dismissing each collapsed trial as a mere flesh wound.</p> <p><strong> </strong>The government line seems to have been that \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/CEOofHMCTS/status/1241703597789806592?s=20\">justice is not optional</a>\u201d. A sweet homily, betrayed only by the evidence of the past decade, in which victims, defendants and witnesses have found their cases mishandled or delayed for years due to enormous cuts to the budgets of the police, Crown Prosecution Service, courts and legal aid. Justice has been optional whenever financially or politically convenient.</p> <p>One real reason for the intransigence appears to be Buckland\u2019s fear of becoming known as \u201cthe lord chancellor who closed the courts\u201d, a disfiguring blemish on the CV in this tough-on-crime government. But there is also a secondary, practical concern: because of government cuts, including cutting the number of sitting days, we have a backlog of <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/crown-court-backlog-rises-for-first-time-in-four-years-7mt8v7ljw\">more than 30,000 crown court trials</a> and are currently trying cases for offences said to have occurred two or more years ago.

  "<p>Looking at your face through the unforgiving green eye of a webcam can be confronting. You might look older, more exhausted or simply less put together than you thought \u2013 and then there\u2019s the fact that, for the other people in the meeting, your face is taking up the entire screen.</p> <p>We asked three beauty experts, who are all very familiar with the potential ravages of digital communication, how to put your best face forward on camera.</p> <h2>Set the scene</h2> <p>Where you put your laptop or phone makes more difference to how you\u2019ll look on camera than what you\u2019re wearing or how you\u2019ve done your makeup.</p> <p>Paula Joye, the founder and editor of lifestyle website The Joye, says we need to \u201cthink a lot more Helmut Newton about this\u201d. She suggests: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to light yourself evenly. Try and put your computer near a window. Natural light\u2019s your friend.\u201d</p> <p>How you position your camera matters too. \u201cIt amuses me no end when you see people beam in like the Moon in the Faraway Tree,\u201d says Joye. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to put your face on the screen like a dinner plate.\u201d It may be called a laptop, but putting your computer on your lap for a video call is a quick way to make yourself look much worse than usual.</p> <p>Instead, she suggests positioning your camera at or just above eye level, and moving yourself slightly further away from it. Make sure your background is clean too, \u201cnobody wants to see last night\u2019s dinner.\u201d</p> <h2>Think like a newsreader</h2> <p> Joye says that for meetings in the cloud, \u201call the basics of dress and presentation still apply. When you\u2019re still doing external meetings \u2026 managing [client] expectations that the sky isn\u2019t falling \u2026 you probably want to be dressed as though you were seeing them in person.\u201d However, she warns that spots, stripes and other patterned tops will not show up well on camera. \u201cThink about newsreader style \u2026 A neutral colour is really good. No crazy patterns, it\u2019s not the time for a Ken Done sweater.\u201d</p> <p>Lillian Ahenkan \u2013 a DJ, presenter and beauty expert who shares her wisdom under the moniker FlexMami, suggests you \u201ctransition the energy you put towards getting dressed\u201d like making sure your nails are done and your shoes go with your outfit, \u201cand put that towards your face and hair\u201d \u2026 \u201cAnd by doing your hair I mean \u2018put it in a ponytail and call it a day\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Finally, like a newsreader, \u201cit\u2019s really what\u2019s above the desk that counts\u201d, says Joye. Or, as Ahenkan puts it, \u201cpyjama bottoms all the way\u201d.</p> <h2>Give yourself dimension</h2> <p>Nicole Thompson, a makeup artist and author of Making It Up, says over video \u201cthings can look quite flat\u201d. If you\u2019re time poor \u2013 which with kids at home is more than likely \u2013 she suggests focusing on two quick areas: your cheeks and your brows.</p> <p>For your cheeks \u201cit\u2019s good to give dimension to your skin, highlighting is great, whether it\u2019s a cream or a powder ... it\u2019ll make things look fresh\u201d. Both Joye and Thompson agree that blush is also a fast way to give your face definition.</p> <p>As for your brows, these \u201care what you are showing your expression through\u201d, says Thompson. Making sure they\u2019re clearly defined will make it easier for people to read and understand your emotions. \u201cMaybe for a serious meeting make your brows darker,\u201d Thompson laughs.</p> <h2>Check yourself out</h2> <p>Thompson, Joye and Ahenkan all suggest checking out how you look in your own webcam before you beam into a big meeting. Because cameras tend to wash people out, you might want to wear a bit more foundation than usual, for instance. But if your jawline is not blended properly, it will really show up, warns Joye.</p> <p>While it\u2019s a great way to make yourself look more put together quickly, Joye and Thompson note there can be some pitfalls to lipstick. \u201cReally bright lipstick can look so wrong on a screen,\u201d Joye notes. While Thompson says \u201con video anything that\u2019s dark can look smaller. What that means is if you\u2019re going to wear a dark lipstick that day, make sure you use a lipliner so your lips don\u2019t look too tiny. Or perhaps overdraw it slightly or soften the edges.\u201d</p> <p>She adds, \u201cit\u2019s the same thing with eyes. Don\u2019t go too dark on the eyes because everything can go dark and small.\u201d Thompson suggests ditching a time-consuming smokey eye in favour of curled eyelashes and lots of mascara, as these things are quicker, and will open up your face.</p> <h2>Filters are your friend</h2> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re using FaceTime or an iPhone, says Joye, \u201cthere are filters, so you can muck around with them. I have no problem zooming into a conference in black and white. Maybe not the dog ears. But there\u2019s nothing wrong with going Marilyn Monroe old age of Hollywood.\u201d</p> <p>On Zoom, there\u2019s a <a href=\"https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115002595343-Touch-Up-My-Appearance\">face softening filter</a> that will put your camera into a softer focus, while calls or video messages over Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram have a whole range of filters to play with. While it\u2019s probably not ideal for a formal meeting, Akenhan says filters can bring a bit of joy into a casual catchup.</p> <p>\u201cI would use any filter that doesn\u2019t look lifelike, because it comes to a point where ... it gets confusing. I\u2019m always wary of using smoothing filters or lip enlarging filters because I fear having body dysmorphia. I feel like makeup in itself is inherently dysmorphic, so I try to wear my bare face as often as I wear makeup ... Just use the elf filter, or a fairy. Something that looks nothing like you so you don\u2019t get confused when you stare in the mirror.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><strong>Is it acceptable to shout at people \u2013 not just friends and family, but also strangers \u2013 for not practising social distancing</strong><strong>?<br></strong><em>Martin, London</em></p> <p>Status update on me: I am spending every day, all day, inside my home with three children under five and a deranged, underwalked terrier who barks incessantly at his own reflection in the window. Am I lucky? You bet: I have a home and, so far, everyone has their health. But does my life also resemble a Channel 5 reality TV show? Maybe just a touch.</p> <p>It is perhaps because of this that I spent most of the weekend wanting to shout at people. Not at the children or the dog because that would only add to the noise, and if we go up by just one decibel I honestly think we would break international law. No, I wanted to shout at the people I could see casually strolling outside as if it were just another Sunday, la la la, is that cafe open for lunch? Oh no, it isn\u2019t, how strange, la la la, we\u2019ll just wander around until we find some coffee, we\u2019re too busy taking a selfie of our lovely weekend to move off the pavement and give two metres of space to that elderly woman walking past us, la la la. The ones I saw playing football in the local park when I took the poor dog for his now very hurried daily 10-minute walk. The ones shaking germ-ridden hands with careless abandon while I mentally nosedived between them in slow-motion while screaming: \u201cNoooooooo!\u201d</p> <p>By the time a woman came up to me (while I backed up nervily in order to maintain the requisite two metres and she edged ever closer, as if we were about to break into some kind of traditional dance) and asked where the playground was, I had reached my endpoint.</p> <p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be taking your child to the playground anyway!\u201d I barked. And then, as if to prove my kid-advice credentials, I added: \u201cI have three children locked up at home! It\u2019s the best way!\u201d Realising that I had made myself sound a bit like Josef Fritzl, I reckoned it was probably time to head back to the bunker.</p> <p>When it comes to failing to self-isolate or practise social distancing, surely everyone feels free to tell off members of their family. Telling each other off is what having a family is all about! OK, maybe it is about a bit more than that, but if you can\u2019t be honest with the teenagers or older people in your family and tell them \u2013 for their own sakes and the sakes of others \u2013 to stay the frick inside for Gawd\u2019s sake, then you really need to work on your familial relations.</p> <p>Friends, too, deserve your honesty. So, if you have friends that mention they are heading to their (heretofore never mentioned) second home, you are fully within your rights to tell them to stop being selfish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/10/typhoid-mary-super-spreader-history\">Typhoid Marys</a>, bringing their germs to a little country village that is unequipped to handle a pandemic, all because they want a nice view from the kitchen.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJeRgjlLaZk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TJeRgjlLaZk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>\u2018You have to go home\u2019 ... Italian mayors lose patience with citizens who refuse to self-isolate.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The strangers issue is, I accept, slightly more awkward, especially in Britain, where being approached by a stranger is considered by some to be a breach of their human rights. My favourite online video at the moment shows various Italian mayors screaming at people to stay at home, <em>per l\u2019amor di Dio</em>! </p> <p>\u201cI saw a fellow citizen amiably jog up and down. I stopped him and said: \u2018Look, this isn\u2019t a movie. You are not Will Smith in I Am Legend. You have to go home,\u2019\u201d one recalls. \u201cI\u2019m going to address you all,\u201d another begins. \u201cWhere the fuck are you going?!\u201d</p> <p>Sure, we can blame the UK government for failing to give advice as clearly as Italian mayors are doing. Yes, Boris Johnson is a useless bit of lettuce who always bottles his big moment \u2013 NOT NEWS. So, it is not entirely some people\u2019s fault if they do not know what to do. But acknowledging that does not get us very far and, the fact is, the virus is spreading. So, in the absence of the government getting the message across, it is up to us to make like an Italian mayor and tell our fellow citizens what they need to know: you are not Will Smith in I Am Legend.

  "<p>To stop the spread of the coronavirus, the UK prime minister has urged people to steer clear of each other when they leave their homes.</p> \n<p>So what is the new outdoor etiquette?</p> \n<p>From jogging in the park, to queuing in supermarkets, experts say Britons have to ditch their usual reserve \u2013 and get used to telling people to \u201cmove away\u201d.<br></p> \n<h2><strong>The </strong><strong>supermarket queue</strong></h2> \n<p>Social distancing means leaving 2 metres space between people. That is just under 6ft 7in \u2013 a little less than the height of the former England striker Peter Crouch, or roughly the length of two standard supermarket trolleys.</p> \n<p>Some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrentToderian/status/1240443980338188288\">supermarkets are helping shoppers by placing sticky-backed markers on the floor</a> 2 metres apart.</p> \n<p> \u201cIf someone comes up behind, it\u2019s tricky. It may create a slightly tense situation,\u201d said <a href=\"https://medium.com/@michael.g.head\">Dr Michael Head</a>, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p> \u201cWe should be emboldened and empowered to be able to say to them: \u2018Please just take a step back.\u2019</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not used to doing it. We are quite reserved as a nation. Maybe in other countries it might be easier.\u201d</p> \n<p>Andrew Opie, the director of food and sustainability at the <a href=\"http://www.brc.org.uk/\">British Retail Consortium</a>, said retailers were employing measures to help shoppers keep their distance. \u201cThese include controlling the flow of customers into stores, placing floor distance guides for those queuing inside stores, and communicating with customers to remind them of the importance of social distancing.</p> \n<p>\u201cHowever, the focus for staff remains ensuring customers have access to goods on shelves; customers must play their part in ensuring responsible and safe shopping by keeping 2 metres apart wherever possible \u2013 both inside stores and if queuing outside \u2013 and everyone should feel confident in asking fellow customers to do the same.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Jogging</strong></h2> \n<p> In the UK, jogging and running are among few outdoor activities still available. For some, however, the thought of encountering a heavily perspiring runner who is exhaling heavily as they overtake at close quarters on a narrow path may cause alarm.</p> \n<p>Runners should keep their distance too, though the risk of passing on the virus is small.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere will be a risk there, but it will be a very small risk,\u201d said Head. \u201cYou are running up behind someone and past them. The time you will be close to them will be minimal. So the risk of transmission at that precise point will be very, very tiny.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe definition of a contact thus far is within 2 metres for 15 minutes. So if you are on public transport, or stuck in a restaurant with someone, that has the potential to be a contact there. If you are running past someone for a few seconds, in an outdoor space as well, the risk of transmission at that point is tiny.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/coronauk-zip/giv-3902nQ1IbOzUpOAS\" data-alt=\"UK coronavirus hotspots\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/coronauk-zip/giv-3902nQ1IbOzUpOAS\">UK coronavirus hotspots</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Runners, however, are known to spit \u2013 and that poses a different problem.</p> \n<p>The issue was addressed by <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/health-nutrition/a31488775/spit-snot-etiquette-for-cyclists-coronavirus/\">Amy Treakle, an infectious disease specialist</a> with the Polyclinic in Seattle, who has said: \u201cCovid-19 is spread by respiratory droplets when a person coughs or sneezes, and transmission may occur when these droplets enter the mouths, noses, or eyes of people who are nearby. Spit contains saliva but could also contain sputum from the lungs or drainage from the posterior nasopharynx.\u201d</p> \n<p>She has also advised against shooting mucus out of your nose. The new etiquette, in short, is do neither \u2013 at least around anyone else.</p> \n<h2><strong>Walking</strong></h2> \n<p>Spring sunshine led to thousands leaving towns and cities for Britain\u2019s beaches and wide open spaces.</p> \n<p>Such crowds present serious risk. Even those who eventually managed to find a deserted spot would probably have had to negotiate a busy car park.</p> \n<p>The walking charity Ramblers UK advises people to only walk locally, in places that can be accessed without a car or public transport.</p> \n<p>\u201cAvoid busy places, including popular parks, beauty spots or beaches,\u201d it said. Keep 2 metres apart and \u201cavoid touching gates, fences etc\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you do, clean your hands with anti-bac and wash your hands as soon as possible.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/cumulative\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Head said: \u201cIf you have anxiety, for example, and you\u2019ve gone out for a walk to reduce that anxiety, what you don\u2019t need is to have to ask people to get out of your way. It\u2019s a tricky thing to do anyway.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s up to all of us to recognise that other people might not be willing to speak up , and not to put them in that position where they need to speak up.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Touchscreen tills</strong></h2> \n<p>These tills are a great place for viruses and bacteria to be passed from person to person, according to infectious disease epidemiologists. The British Retail Consortium has stressed that stores have increased the number of deep cleans and are implementing other measures.</p> \n<p>Should you whip out the anti-bacterial wipes or don the rubber gloves?</p> \n<p>\u201cI think we need to try as far as possible not to be embarrassed by little things that we might previously have been embarrassed about,\u201d said Head. \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly fine to wash your hands in public before and after touching door handles and screens. It\u2019s a key message that people need to carry on doing.\u201d As for gloves: \u201cIf people feel reassured by that, then wear gloves.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><em>Spoiler alert: this blog is published after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/westworld\">Westworld</a> airs on HBO in the US and Sky Atlantic in the UK on Sunday night/Monday morning. Do not read unless you have watched season three, episode two.<br><br></em>\u201cIt\u2019s alright darling, none of it matters\u201d, says Maeve as she puts a pistol to her head, \u201cbecause none of it is real.\u201d And ain\u2019t that the truth.</p> <p>At the point of pulling the trigger Maeve is Isabella, a Italian partisan during the second world war. She\u2019s also a host in Warworld, a park which simulates the conflict with a cast of robots. For the partisans, there\u2019s no escaping the Nazis ,and for the android hosts there\u2019s no escaping the park. Unless you\u2019re Maeve, that is, in which case you know the whole World War thing is a lie, that you\u2019re in a park, and that if you deactivate yourself by means of a bullet to the cerebral cortex you get to go into the back office and start again.</p> <p>In the first two seasons of Westworld, Maeve was the closest thing we had to a hero. A robot who had become sentient, unlike most of her peers experiencing a similar revelation she chose not to slaughter humans as a result. Instead, driven by memories of a lost daughter, she decided to save her fellow hosts by leading them to a new homeland beyond the parks. In the finale of season two she achieved her goals, but appeared to have sacrificed herself in the process, dying in a final battle.</p> <p>You can\u2019t keep a good droid down though, so here we are back in Maeve\u2019s company again. After she pulls the trigger in Warworld, we follow her deep down below where, as luck would have it, she meets Lee Sizemore. Sizemore was Westworld\u2019s Head of Narrative, the guy who wrote the storylines for the park and a man who, we were led to believe, had also been killed in the massacre that took out Maeve. But here he is, alive and well, albeit with a bit of a limp. More strikingly, the perma-cynic has turned cheery and has a crush on Maeve.</p> <p>Lee says he\u2019s the one responsible for putting Maeve in Warworld because, secretly, he wanted her to escape and Warworld is closest to the hatch, known as the Forge. The pair of them skedaddle over there when no one\u2019s looking and try to open the hatch. But no sooner have they realised they can\u2019t unlock it than everything gets a bit wavy, Lee develops a st-st-stutter and Maeve comes to the realisation that, nope, this isn\u2019t real neither.</p> <p>Yes we\u2019ve entered Inception levels of unreality (something Westworld creator Jonathan Nolan knows all about). Lee, Maeve surmises, is not a human nor even a host but part of a mammoth simulation that she has been placed into for reasons as yet unclear.</p> <p>After an amusing detour back into the park\u2019s underbelly where Maeve gives the staff a maths challenge (\u2018what is the square root of -1?\u2019 - a question that produces a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_unit\">notoriously mind-bending</a> answer), and a brief trip to Warworld to confuse everybody there, Maeve manages to make the simulation fall apart through overwork. When that happens she is able to see behind the curtain that\u2019s behind the curtain, and sees a chance to enter the real, real world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17159a6ef52b03072ee88f1847aef863f94f4518\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17159a6ef52b03072ee88f1847aef863f94f4518/0_243_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Man of mystery ...

Vincent Cassel as Serac.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Maeve plotline takes up the majority of this week\u2019s episode and is a typically Westworld-ian combination of high-faluting theory, hefty exposition (why are we here? What does this mean?) and some nice one-liners (\u201cFuck me!\u201d says Lee in shock, \u201cNot likely darling\u201d, replies Maeve the one-time madame).</p> <p>There is another story, though, which is less tortuous and involves Bernard. It also features another character you thought was a human turning out to be otherwise, with the revelation that Westworld\u2019s head of security, Stubbs, was a host all along. While it does make you wonder if there\u2019s any individual who can\u2019t be snappily resurrected as a robot should the circumstances require, Stubbs does at least appear to have come back a bit spunkier, with a little more attitude and a desire for action which, at one point, sees him chase down half a dozen Delos security guards with just one arm and an axe.</p> <p>Bernard has returned to Westworld to look for Maeve. She, as we know, is elsewhere, and so instead Bernard finds Stubbs, having apparently taken his own life (what is it with this show and bullets through the brain?) in the little cottage where WestWorld\u2019s creator, old man Ford, used to do his experiments. Bernard reanimates Stubbs and there\u2019s a funny bit where Stubbs hacks up the bullet that took him out as if it were a ball of phlegm.</p> <p>After that the pair head out into the parks. They don\u2019t visit Warworld, but they do reach \u2018park four\u2019, a cheeky little nod to Game of Thrones, complete with host dragons and a minstrel playing the Westworld theme on a lute. Eventually Bernard gets access to the parks\u2019 computer system, in the hope it might help him find Maeve. Instead he learns that someone has been messing about and accessing the data of previous guests. Bernard assumes that person is big bad Dolores and suggests that he and Stubbs should go and find the guest she seemed most curious about; that bloke called Liam we met last week.</p> <p>So that\u2019s episode two, one dedicated to setting our good guys on a path towards their enemy. The journey culminates in an epilogue in which Maeve awakes in the human world and has her actual, final, in no way revisable situation explained to her by that bloke from La Haine.</p> <p>Vincent Cassel plays Serac, the AI oligarch who was mentioned a lot last week, but never seen. He chooses not to explain to Maeve what that whole simulation thing was all about but does tell her he now needs her in a war to save humanity. From here on in it will be Maeve v Dolores to the death. Or whatever the equivalent is for a robot.</p> <h2>Divergences and anomalies</h2> <ul> <li><p>For future reference, here\u2019s the serial number for Maeve\u2019s control unit \u2013 HC1983012522.</p></li> <li><p>Is it just coincidence that the maintenance robot looks exactly like the ones from Boston Dynamics that everyone laughs at because they can\u2019t walk very well and yet here they\u2019re scarily nimble?

  "<p>According to official statistics, China has defeated the coronavirus. Over the last five days, health authorities have reported only one new locally transmitted case of Covid-19 \u2013 a patient in Guangdong province infected by someone travelling from abroad. In Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak and the country\u2019s worst-hit area, officials on Monday reported a fifth day without new cases.</p> \n<p>The figures are a sharp drop from just a month ago when recording a daily increase of fewer than 2,000 new infections was a milestone. Authorities have begun <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/wuhan-eases-coronavirus-lockdown-as-restrictions-intensify-outside-china\">easing Wuhan\u2019s two-month lockdown</a> while cities across the country are following orders to \u201cfully restore\u201d production and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/chinese-life-slowly-gets-back-to-normal-as-the-epidemic-subsides-coronavirus\">resume normal life</a>.</p> \n<p>But as the country returns to work, residents and analysts doubt the near-zero community transmission rate, worrying that leaders have prioritised restarting the economy over decisively containing the virus. While public health experts, as well as citizens, say the situation in China has improved dramatically \u2013 the result of aggressive testing, quarantines and social distancing \u2013 many doubt the numbers are as good as officials have reported.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0a09a661-0ee2-41ea-b0a0-9e1deefd9268\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is Covid-19?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Covid-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI am really worried that there are still many asymptomatic infected people inside Wuhan.

Kyodo News in Japan reported at the weekend that a local doctor said the<a href=\"https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2020/03/b09b868ec468-breaking-news-wuhan-doctor-blows-whistle-on-manipulation-of-virus-patient-numbers.html\"> number of cases had been manipulated</a> before President Xi Jinping\u2019s visit earlier this month, prompting the beginning of \u201ca mass release of infected patients\u201d.</p> \n<p>Allegations of new infections in Wuhan have persisted on social media to such an extent that authorities issued <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/oGxlUZO09CVwAX25pFsXZQ\">a detailed statement</a> over the weekend debunking them.</p> \n<p>Some of the concerns about China\u2019s reporting stem from how Beijing classifies patients. While the World Health Organization and South Korea consider anyone who has tested positive for the virus as a confirmed case, China does not include asymptomatic infections in its final tally.</p> \n<p>Late on Monday night, Wuhan\u2019s health commission published a Q&amp;A explaining how asymptomatic cases are dealt with. On why such cases are not included as confirmed cases, the commission said that patients were quarantined for 14 days and if they began to show symptoms they would be designated as confirmed and that data would be published.</p> \n<p>\u201cA small number of asymptomatic infections may progress to becoming confirmed cases, but the vast majority [of patients] will heal by themselves,\u201d it said.</p> \n<p>Critics also question why recovered patients who retest as positive are not counted.

  "<p>The social historian Malcolm Chase, who has died aged 63 after suffering from a brain tumour, explored the world of working-class people in 19th-century Britain and their radical movements.

Hearing Malcolm lecture on the Chartists was always a thrilling experience: he recognised that radicals expressed themselves through fiction and poetry, and sometimes burst into song. He was open to literary scholarship rethinking the aesthetic and imaginative aspects of 19th-century radicalism and acknowledged the importance of locality, examining events in Scotland, Wales and Ireland as well as England.</p> <p>When he started writing, historians tended to be more interested in the industrial revolution as a background to the rise of the labour movement. However, Malcolm argued that, far from being a backward-looking anachronism, radical agrarianism was central to working-class experience and the development of new kinds of oppositional politics.</p> <p>In The People\u2019s Farm (1988), he examined the relationship between \u201cland consciousness\u201d and early socialism, offering a new evaluation of Thomas Spence, the English radical who supported the common ownership of land.

His interest in this field was heightened by teaching in centres around Leeds and Middlesbrough, and he became head of the eventual school of continuing education. In 2005 he joined the history department and four years later was appointed professor.</p> <p>A collaboration with the all-party parliamentary group on history and archives led to an exhibition and <a href=\"https://www.archives.org.uk/what-we-do/campaigns/parliamentary-activity/appg-events.html\" title=\"\">a lecture on the Chartists</a> (2013) in the Speaker\u2019s rooms at Westminster.

Malcolm met Jeremy Irons in a London pub to tell of how the actor\u2019s great-great-grandfather, a Chartist, had served 18 months in Newgate prison for his involvement in planning an armed conspiracy, the authorities having been tipped off by an informer.</p> <p>Inspired by the participatory ethos of the History Workshop Movement of the 70s, Malcolm kept in touch with \u2013 and continued to learn from \u2013 local historians, amateur enthusiasts and the interested general public.

Everyone dressed down except for Chita Rivera.</p> <p>It was an evening of people trying hard and succeeding sometimes, as when Adrienne Warren, in a bubble bath and after several audio glitches, sang Simply the Best and pretended to jam on a miniature saxophone. But by the time Barry Manilow was muttering \u201cIt\u2019s gotta end, it\u2019s gotta end,\u201d the hopeful sentiment addressed both the pandemic and the show, which was intimate and dumb and terribly produced and as a clumsy expression of tremendous goodwill, really very nice.

There are real concerns about our right to protest through to care for the disabled.\u201d</p> \n<p>Among possible powers in the bill is for police, public health and immigration officers to detain people suspected of having Covid-19, to force them to isolate, and to fine them if they refuse a test.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-tributes-and-memories\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-tributes-and-memories&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus-tributes-and-memories</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Other elements of the bill give legal force to the closure of schools and nurseries, allow ministers to ban gatherings, and gives extra intervention powers if the government suspects anyone is disrupting the distribution of food. Another element would permit the closure of the UK\u2019s borders if too many border staff fell ill.</p> \n<p>Other measures intended to ease pressures on the NHS would allow recently retired medical staff and students who have nearly qualified to work immediately, with protection given against any negligence claims. Other provisions are connected to improving access to statutory sick pay, and speeding up the process for funerals.</p>",

I had mentioned in a newspaper and on my podcast that she was poorly with COVID-19. Aunty Jean passed away yesterday morning. Eldest of 3 sisters. Aunty Jean was in her 80s but had so much living to do. Aunty Jean never ever ever did anything but bring sunshine in to my life. She lived near my boarding school and would pop in as often as she could to make sure I had Quavers, Pot Noodles, Parma Ham, a bit of cash, knowing how far from home I was. Aunty Jean lived in and around sport all her life and was so kind to everyone she met. Kindness, generosity of spirit, a giver of time. It has knocked all of us in the family. My cousin Claire has lost her Mum who had so many more years to give. Aunty Jean never got to meet her newly born Great Granddaughter. We will all miss you Aunty Jean. Aunty Jean asked us not to cry with her final words. We love you so much.</a></p> <p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;>A post shared by <a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/willgreenwood/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;> Will Greenwood</a> (@willgreenwood) on <time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2020-03-22T09:53:14+00:00&quot;>Mar 22, 2020 at 2:53am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=&quot;//www.instagram.com/embed.js&quot;></script></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure>",

On Sunday Senate Democrats said the bailout of businesses, including airlines, did not adequately protect workers or include restrictions on bailed-out businesses.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the midst of an unprecedented national crisis, Republicans can\u2019t seriously expect us to tell people in our communities who are suffering that we shortchanged hospitals, students, workers and small businesses, but gave big corporations hundreds of billions of dollars in a secretive slush fund,\u201d said Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat of Washington state.</p> \n<p>That news sent stock markets sharply lower on Monday morning and even news of the bailout failed to cheer investors.

  "<p>\u201cEvery time you get depressed, comedy will be there to drag your ass out of it,\u201d said Robin Williams in 1996. It is a gut-punch of a quote, considering that depression was one of the factors that led to his death 18 years later (although his wife has said the main reason for his suicide was probably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/03/robin-williams-disintegrating-before-suicide-widow-says\">the debilitating brain disease diffuse Lewy body dementia</a>). It also speaks to a nagging sense that there is some truth to the \u201ctears of a clown\u201d cliche: that many of those who seek to make us laugh are masking private sadness.</p> <p>The list of comedy greats who have had some form of mental illness is long: Richard Pryor, Spike Milligan, Caroline Aherne, Stephen Fry, Joan Rivers and Kenneth Williams to name a few. The doubters say that it is no more common among comics than anyone else \u2013 they are just more cognisant of the bad stuff in the world and have the outlet to talk about it.</p> <p>So what of today\u2019s comedians? Is comedy dragging their ass out of anything? \u201cIt\u2019s where I found all my joy when I was having a tough year, with heartbreak and losing a close family member,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/dec/09/suzi-ruffell-review-warwick-arts-centre\">Suzi Ruffell</a>, who has appeared on TV shows including Mock the Week and The Last Leg. \u201cPerforming was the one thing that was just mine. On stage, I was talking about how shit things were and people were laughing, and I often think that is them saying: \u2018Me too, I\u2019ve felt that.\u2019 If it wasn\u2019t for that, my healing process would have taken a lot longer.\u201d</p> <p>For John Robins, a BBC Radio 5 live DJ and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/26/edinburgh-fringe-comedy-award-shared-hannah-gadsby-john-robins\">Edinburgh Comedy award winner</a>, the stage is a safe place and \u201can island of control\u201d \u2013 but the process of writing comedy helps him more than the performance, he says: \u201cStandup is my way of making sense of my life and how I feel about myself. Often, I don\u2019t really get a handle on what\u2019s happening until it\u2019s found a life in a routine.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of nonsense written about \u2018comedy as therapy\u2019 \u2013 the therapy is the writing bit that happened eight months ago, the practice that happened six months ago, the honing that happened four months ago. There have been moments when I\u2019ve been writing difficult bits, I\u2019ve been sitting in my kitchen in floods of tears because I didn\u2019t realise the way I felt until I wrote it down. By the time most people see it, I\u2019m totally over that bit.\u201d</p> <p>It is a timely moment to revisit the subject of comedy and mental health, as some of its moving parts have shifted in the past decade. First, standups have been increasingly open about their mental health and traumatic episodes in their life. Some tackle this in an unobtrusive way, letting the stories of life\u2019s ups and downs speak for themselves, but many (notably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/feb/22/kim-noble-youre-not-alone-review-soho-theatre-london\">Kim Noble</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jul/16/hannah-gadsby-trauma-comedy-nanette-standup-netflix\">Hannah Gadsby</a>) have laid it bare in shocking detail. Last year, the documentary <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBV-7_qGlr4\">Laughing Matters</a> got comics (such as Sarah Silverman and the US Office\u2019s Rainn Wilson) off the stage to tell their stories without the jokes in between.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"31b4e5d81189e8509e5292d5e1eb094553ba437d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31b4e5d81189e8509e5292d5e1eb094553ba437d/0_0_2595_3896/667.jpg\" alt=\"Hannah Gadsby with her Emmy for her disarmingly honest Netflix special Nanette\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Into the mainstream ... Hannah Gadsby won an Emmy in 2019 for her disarmingly honest Netflix special Nanette.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The second big change has been the rise of social media, which has increased exposure for all, but especially those in the public eye. Third is the conversation around mental health, which has become far more sensitive, sophisticated and widespread. When a major broadcaster has a <a href=\"https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/pick-week-itvs-silent-ad-break-golden/1661868\">\u201csilent ad break\u201d</a> to encourage people to check in with each other \u2013 as ITV did last autumn \u2013 you know mental health has gone mainstream.</p> <p>Broadcasters are doing their bit again this week, with <a href=\"https://dave.uktv.co.uk/shows/comedy-against-living-miserably/\">Comedy Against Living Miserably</a>, a three-part series on Dave in association with the mental health charity Calm. In each show, comics \u2013 including Ruffell, Robins, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/mar/02/nish-kumar-i-have-not-got-over-brexit\">Nish Kumar</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/11/kiri-pritchard-mclean-review-pacey-lean-precision-tooled-set-from-increasingly-impressive-comic\">Kiri Pritchard-McLean</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/23/darren-harriott-review-edinburgh-2019\">Darren Harriott</a> \u2013 will speak about everything from grief to anxiety to gaslighting and perform material on these subjects. As Robins says: \u201cMental health is life. As a standup, you\u2019re talking about your life, your experiences, good and bad. Everyone has mental health.\u201d</p> <p>But for all the introspection that comes with standup, this generation of comics are a responsible lot. Ruffell and Robins are aware of how much their comedy can benefit their audiences, too \u2013 especially at a time like this, which feels bleak and lonely for so many. Robins says people have told him (\u201cthe partners, usually\u201d) that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/may/05/making-waves-radio-djs-men-and-mental-health-john-robins-elis-james\">his radio show with fellow comedian</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/may/05/making-waves-radio-djs-men-and-mental-health-john-robins-elis-james\"> Elis James</a> has got them through a tough time. Off the back of that, Robins and James started a podcast, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07rq6vh/episodes/downloads\">How Do You Cope?</a>, that is aimed squarely at the subject of mental health.</p> <p>Ruffell\u2019s experience of how her comedy can help others will be an eye-opener to many: \u201cI\u2019ve had people travel 100 miles [to one of my shows] because they wanted to bring their gay teenage daughter to see me, because she doesn\u2019t have a gay network at all. On more than one occasion, I\u2019ve had a teenager say to me: \u2018When you\u2019re on TV, it reminds my mum that I\u2019m normal.\u2019 So it\u2019s really important that they get to see someone like them under a spotlight talking about their experiences.\u201d</p> <p>Robins recognises, however, that comedy has limits in its influence. As a comic on stage, the best he can hope to achieve is \u201cthousands of tiny impacts\u201d. The same applies to many mental health campaigns, he says \u2013 the hashtag slogans #bekind and #reachout are \u201cabsolutely vital right now\u201d, but a drop in the ocean in the context of \u201cservices that are so stretched and so cut that they barely exist\u201d. He says: \u201cThe best way to actually improve the nation\u2019s mental health is to pay your taxes, encourage companies to pay their taxes and vote for a government that will spend that money in the most useful way, regardless of what political colour you are.\u201d</p> <p>The flip side of all this is that being a standup can also exacerbate mental health problems. It is a solitary job, with unpredictable results from one night to the next and little security in the long term, which is hardly a recipe for a settled existence. Robins says that writing a show requires \u201cholding yourself in places of anxiety, frustration or anger, and that isn\u2019t a healthy place to be\u201d. The Laugh Factory comedy club in Los Angeles has gone as far as getting an <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/2/28/21142319/comedy-therapist-laugh-factory\">in-house psychologist</a>, who was hired because \u201crecognised that comedians needed more support than he could provide\u201d.</p> <p>And then there is social media. Being active online is almost obligatory for comics today \u2013 and a necessity now that the possibility of performing live is gone for lord knows how long. The Faustian pact they make is that they give more of themselves away; they are \u201con\u201d when they are padding around at home, not only when they are on stage. \u201cPeople want a fuller idea of what a comic is these days,\u201d Ruffell says. \u201cI don\u2019t mind sharing a bit more, but not everyone does, and if I see another comic sharing too much or tweeting certain things I\u2019ll send them a text just saying: \u2018Are you OK?\u2019 We do have to look out for each other. For the sake of my mental health I have to tweet and not scroll.\u201d</p> <p>More alarmingly, she says: \u201cThe thing that\u2019s affected me the most [from social media] is the element of threat. I had this troll that just kept on saying: \u2018I\u2019m gonna rape you straight.\u2019 That\u2019s a really weird thing to read when you\u2019re at a train station, travelling home by yourself. Sometimes it happens on the way to a gig and you have to go on stage and be all: \u2018Hey! How\u2019s everyone doing?!\u2019 It\u2019s an extra thing people don\u2019t consider that wears away at you.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/12/eurydice-dixon-killer-to-spend-life-behind-bars-after-failing-in-appeal-bid\">The </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/12/eurydice-dixon-killer-to-spend-life-behind-bars-after-failing-in-appeal-bid\">murder of the Melbourne-based comedian Eurydice Dixon in 2018</a>, after a gig, shows that comics must tread the difficult line between taking such threats seriously and living their lives.</p> <p>But these are boom times for standup. There are more touring comics than ever before and more TV opportunities. The nature of the form means that, the second a comedian get on stage, with the spotlight and the mic, they have authority \u2013 and we in the audience or at home put them on a pedestal. The fact that many comics want to use this soft power for good is a start. As Ruffell says: \u201cI just hope there are people out there who watch the show and feel less alone.\u201d</p> <p><em>Comedy Against Living Miserably starts on Dave on </em><em>24 March</em><em> at 9pm</em></p> <p><em>In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

However, at this time, it is also vitally important that checks and balances are in place to ensure that human rights are not disregarded, and that people remain fully protected under the law.\u201d</p> \n<p>Elsewhere, the new law aims to ease pressures on the NHS by allowing recently retired medical staff and students who have nearly qualified to work immediately, with protection given against any negligence claims.

But she went on to add a significant qualification, that \u201cthe discussions there were also a reminder that, although I loved the unlimited licence to invent, I also loved the sense of exploring not an inner, but an outer world, that was really there, in some objective sense\u201d. This week\u2019s poem seems to accommodate this dilemma, by working on a borderline between inventive \u201cpoetic\u201d figures and more objective description, while never fully letting go of the former.</p> <p>The opening lines are simple and striking. The speaker doesn\u2019t merely lie on her back to look up at the night sky, as any non-astronomer might do, but, childlike, she \u201ceats\u201d the stars. She goes on to tell us how she eats them: she sucks them, and finds the taste \u201cpepper hot and sharp\u201d. This is purposefully visceral and immediate, and a summons to the child star-lover in herself, a tuning-in to the old excitement before academia took over.</p> <p>She continues the \u201cnutrition\u201d metaphor with the word \u201cstir\u201d in the third stanza, but a change of approach is heralded as we\u2019re invited to follow her into the early universe: \u201cNo outer space, just space.\u201d And now poetic diction is reduced, the whole imaginative process more restrained. The biblical creation narrative is recalled, when <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1&amp;version=KJV\">the earth was \u201cwithout form, and void\u201d</a> \u2013 yet the description, especially that of \u201cthe not yet stars\u201d, feels logical and objective.</p> <p>The alternative to stargazing and imagining, proposed in the fifth stanza, is \u201cTo lie down here on earth / Beside our long ancestral bones \u2026\u201d Because of the placing of the conjunction in the first line \u2013 \u201cAnd sometimes it\u2019s enough\u201d \u2013 the activity is subtly emphasised. It\u2019s at least as important as looking up at the stars to be aware of the horizontal neighbourhood, that of our \u201clong ancestral bones\u201d. The pun on \u201clong\u201d is beautifully judged here.</p> <p>Elson doesn\u2019t refute biological \u201cscience\u201d. Dead matter is transformed, but kept interestingly visible in the reference to \u201ccobble fields / Of our discarded skulls\u201d. It\u2019s an imaginative truce with fact, followed by speculation, and recourse to the soul-as-butterfly myth. Inevitably, the \u201cbright wings\u201d connect us to the \u201cbright mist\u201d in stanza four, as if a new creation might transpire from death.</p> <p>Antidotes to Fear of Death is undated, and may have been written before the poet was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the disease from which she died at the age of 39. It\u2019s the kind of intense engagement with death that an imaginative young writer might make, regardless of personal circumstance. As an act of generosity, like so much of Elson\u2019s work, it includes readers by its imaginative accessibility and universal theme. Although \u201cantidote\u201d is a strong word, the poem has some power to challenge the individual\u2019s fear of extinction with a wider, less egocentric focus on space and time. It lies just outside religious consolation, and just outside \u201cscientific\u201d detachment. Imagination is all we have to suggest alternative universes, a quality required for survival, for poetry, and for the hypotheses of science.</p> <p>A Responsibility to Awe was first published in 2001, and was reissued in 2018 as a <a href=\"https://www.carcanet.co.uk/cgi-bin/indexer?product=9781784106553\">Carcanet Classic</a>. To read Elson\u2019s brave and gentle work during the current pandemic crisis is to take a fresh breath, and to see a little farther.</p>",
  "<p>As the number of Covid-19 cases rises worldwide, parents trying to protect their children from the disease can take solace in one thing: the disease has generally been milder in children.</p> \n<p>However, there are many unknowns about coronavirus, and research is ongoing. Here is what we know now.</p> \n<h2><strong>Can children catch coronavirus?</strong></h2> \n<p>Yes. They can be infected with and appear to be able to transmit coronavirus, even if they do not have symptoms. That is why it is important for children to practice social distancing and hand-washing, even if they do not appear ill.</p> \n<h2><strong>How does coronavirus affect children?</strong></h2> \n<p>It is generally believed to cause milder symptoms in children, but the specific impacts by age are becoming clearer as the outbreak goes on.</p> \n<p>Much of what we know today is based on reports out of China, where the outbreak began. There 2.4% of all identified cases were in children under 19 years old. An even smaller number within this group of children had severe symptoms, 2.5%, or what the World Health Organization (WHO) described as \u201ca very small proportion\u201d. But more research is being done and a clearer picture is still emerging.</p> \n<h2><strong>Why does coronavirus </strong><strong>affect children differently?</strong></h2> \n<p>That remains unknown. Dr Jay C Butler, deputy director of infectious disease at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said, \u201cThe phenomenon is very significant,\u201d on a live-streamed show hosted by the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGiOi7eV05g&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Journal of the American Medical Association</a>, but that the mechanisms are \u201creally unknown\u201d.</p> \n<p>People aged 60 and older or with existing health conditions remain the most vulnerable to the coronavirus. That includes people with conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease and chronic respiratory conditions, according to the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf\">WHO</a>.</p> \n<h2><strong>My child has a health condition. Should I be concerned?</strong></h2> \n<p>Respiratory conditions such as asthma often result in more severe cases of viral diseases such as influenza. But the coronavirus is new, and it remains unknown whether it will more severely affect children with asthma.</p> \n<p>Similarly, there is not yet evidence about whether coronavirus could more negatively affect children with diabetes, which is a risk factor for adults. That said, experts at Johns Hopkins University are warning parents to be vigilant.</p> \n<h2><strong>Should I keep my kids home from school?</strong></h2> \n<p>In many countries that decision has been taken out of the hands of parents, with school and educational establishments being closed by governments and local authorities in order to try and halt the spread of the virus.</p> \n<p>If your kids are at home, they will still need regular exercise \u2013 and will need to be practising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/16/how-to-social-distance-convince-friends-family\">social distancing</a> when they are outside.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bde155c3-43e7-4929-8506-bb043a798a88\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2JsWf-2nN1Y?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",
  "<p>Hungary\u2019s parliament will consider an emergency bill this week that would give prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n sweeping powers to rule by decree, without a clear cut-off date.</p> <p>The bill seeks to extend the state of emergency declared earlier this month over coronavirus, and could also see people jailed for spreading information deemed to be fake news. The government has portrayed the move as a necessary response to the unprecedented challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, but critics immediately labelled the legislation as dangerously open-ended and vulnerable to abuse.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have a completely unrestricted mandate for the government,\u201d said M\u00e1rta Pardavi, co-chair of the Hungarian Helsinki Committee. \u201cThe current draft does exactly that. It basically gives an open-ended carte-blanche mandate.\u201d</p> <p>On Sunday, four Hungarian NGOs, including the Helsinki Committee, called on the government to provide a sunset clause to the emergency measures and broaden the scope for constitutional challenges to future decrees enacted within it.</p> <p>The new law would also introduce prison terms of up to five years for anyone publicising false information that alarms the public or impedes government efforts to protect people. It caused disquiet among independent journalists, who have often been accused by the government and its loyal stable of media outlets of peddling fake news.</p> <p>Orb\u00e1n\u2019s spokesman Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs said the lack of a clear end date was in case MPs became too sick for parliament to sit.

However, Orb\u00e1n could wait a week and pass it with a two-thirds majority, which his party Fidesz commands in parliament.</p> <p>\u201cWe will solve this crisis, even without you,\u201d Orb\u00e1n told opposition parties in parliament on Monday.</p> <p>As of Monday morning, there were 167 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Hungary with seven deaths, much lower than in neighbouring Austria and many other western European countries. Part of the reason for the lower numbers could be the much lower levels of testing. With a population of nearly 10 million, Hungary has so far carried out only around 5,000 tests.</p> <p>Orb\u00e1n has governed over the past few years on a staunchly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/28/hungary-election-viktor-orban-far-right-stokes-migration-fears-far-from-border\">nationalist, anti-migration platform</a>, and has already drawn a link between migration and the virus. </p> <p>Hungary has already introduced a range of measures to battle the virus. Last Monday, the government closed off the country to everyone but Hungarian citizens, while restaurants and shops have been limiting opening hours and schools and universities have been closed since last week.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/germany-low-coronavirus-mortality-rate-puzzles-experts\">Germany's low coronavirus mortality rate intrigues experts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are question marks over how efficiently these restrictions work in practice and whether the country\u2019s struggling healthcare system will be able to cope with the virus when the number of cases increases. Hungarian website Index reported at the weekend that those with symptoms who went to hospital for testing were kept close together in waiting rooms, had no access to hand sanitiser, and were told to sign forms using a communal pen. On Monday, Orb\u00e1n guaranteed that by Tuesday, all coronavirus patients and healthcare workers would receive masks.</p> <p>The ban on non-Hungarian citizens entering the country also led to foreign residents being held for long periods of time on arrival at Budapest airport in a confined space. On Wednesday, around 60 foreigners, most of them without masks, were crammed into a small area by a departure gate. When these people were finally given the green light to enter Hungary, they were not instructed to self-isolate or enter quarantine.</p> <p>Other countries in the region have also adopted strict measures early in an attempt to get ahead of the curve. Poland took the decision to ban all flights and close the borders a week ago, despite a low number of confirmed cases. In the Balkans, Serbia has enforced a night curfew while Albania\u2019s government has brought in the army to enforce a 40-hour curfew beginning Saturday lunch time.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Jennifer Rankin in Brussels</em></p>",
  "<p>There\u2019s a disconnect between the reality and the perception of electric vehicles (EV). Forecasts suggest a medium-term crossover point, probably towards the end of this decade, where the car industry is making more EVs than internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. Against that, there still exists a great deal of scepticism in the minds of consumers.</p> <p>\u201cAn EV wouldn\u2019t work for me because \u2026\u201d<em> </em>is a familiar conversation starter. It\u2019s true, there are some people for whom an electric car is simply a non-starter \u2013 but that number is a vanishingly small percentage of the population. For most, an EV is going to be a money saver that makes no obvious impact on lifestyle.</p> <p>Emily Rice, Renault UK\u2019s product manager for electric cars, answers three readers\u2019 questions.</p> <p><strong>I live in a terraced house and park in the street, so I\u2019m unable to have a home charging point. What are my charging options? </strong>Elaine Hills, Brighton</p> <p>Although it\u2019s true that many current EV owners like to charge their cars at home using a dedicated wall-mounted charger in their driveway or garage, the good news is it\u2019s far from the only option.</p> <p>The charging infrastructure to support EVs is constantly growing and evolving. For instance, it was reported in May last year that <a href=\"https://www.londoncouncils.gov.uk/our-key-themes/transport/roads/gulcs\" rel=\"nofollow\">1,076 new residential EV charging points had been installed in London as part of the Go Ultra Low City Scheme (GULCS)</a>, and this figure continues to increase. <a href=\"https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2019/01/virgin-media-uk-harness-broadband-cabinets-for-ev-car-charging.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Virgin Media recently began a pilot project to convert its broadband cabinets into charging points</a>, with a view to eventually providing 40,000 EV charging points across the UK. Elsewhere, there are initiatives such as the MK Promise, through which Milton Keynes council offers to install, within a short walk, an overnight charging point for all new EV owners lacking access to private parking.</p> <p>Access to a public residential charger is, however, still rare, and the much more common practice is to charge at the other end of a regular journey. \u201cIf you\u2019d like to buy an EV, but don\u2019t have the ability to charge it at home, check whether your workplace has charging facilities,\u201d says Rice. \u201cIt\u2019s common to simply not notice charging infrastructure if you don\u2019t own an EV \u2013 but once you start thinking about switching, you really start to notice how many charging points are around you.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/the-power-of-firsts/2020/feb/12/seven-facts-that-will-convince-you-to-make-the-switch-to-an-electric-car\">Seven facts that will convince you to make the switch to an electric car</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Based on data from the various infrastructure suppliers, it is estimated that 90% of charging is done at home or at work. Only 3% takes place en route to a destination, with the rest made up of people who \u201cgraze\u201d \u2013 charging in short bursts at the supermarket, the gym, or a municipal car park. Coffee shops are getting in on the act too, recognising that a half-hour charging cycle is even better than free wifi for creating a captive audience.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth noting that the notional \u201cfull charge\u201d is an ICE hangover, driving until the warning light comes on and then filling the tank. Getting a full charge in Sainsbury\u2019s or Starbucks may take a few hours \u2013 but with EVs such as the New Renault ZOE having a driving range of 245 miles*, it is unlikely you will need to find somewhere to charge every day, so owners aren\u2019t arriving with the (usually metaphorical) needle in the red.</p> <p>If you\u2019re doing the average <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/657839/commuting-in-england-1988-2015.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">10-mile commute</a> twice a day, then an EV can recharge in the time it takes to whizz around the aisles or gulp down a skinny latte. There is massive growth in the number of places offering a charging point. <a href=\"https://www.zap-map.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zap Map</a>, the handy EV app and website, lists more than 31,000 connectors spread across more than 17,800 devices in more than 11,000 locations across the UK \u2013 and the figures are going up daily. More than <a href=\"https://www.zap-map.com/supermarket-ev-charge-point-numbers-double-in-two-years/\" rel=\"nofollow\">6% of the charge points are now found at supermarkets</a>.</p> <p><strong>If you charge an EV and then don\u2019t use it, have you wasted your electricity? </strong>Jonathan Bailey, Sheffield</p> <p>The short answer is: no. Or rather, not really. \u201cThe thing people tend to ask about is leaving their car when they go on holiday,\u201d says Rice. \u201cIf you leave your car at the airport for a couple of weeks, you\u2019re not going to notice a discharge. There\u2019s lots of inbuilt technology in a Renault ZOE designed to ensure the batteries are as efficient as possible. Even if you leave your EV sitting around for a few months, it\u2019s not going to be an issue for the traction battery.\u201d</p> <p>The concern allied to this is the idea that battery performance will be less impressive as the vehicle gets older. While battery capacity can drop as the vehicle gets older \u2013 it won\u2019t be to the extent it did a decade ago when the technology was in its infancy.</p> <p>\u201cI think a lot of people worry that the battery in an EV is like the one in their phone, and they\u2019re going to see the performance decline after a couple of years \u2013 but it really isn\u2019t like that,\u201d says Rice. \u201cWe all know that a phone reaches a point where you\u2019re having to charge it a couple of times a day \u2013 but the technology in the lithium-ion battery of the car is far superior to that. If you\u2019re driving it in the same way as a petrol or diesel car, you\u2019re not going to experience any problems with an EV. We know it\u2019s an area of concern, though, which is why Renault gives its EV batteries an eight-year or 100,000-mile <a href=\"https://www.renault.co.uk/warranty.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">warranty</a>**. Hopefully that inspires confidence in the technology.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1b1a13d5a9661b251ec57ac46be32bae38d0fcd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1b1a13d5a9661b251ec57ac46be32bae38d0fcd/0_262_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Handsome young man with a laptop near charging electric car\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">EVs require less maintenance than cars with engines, and all of Renault\u2019s technicians are EV-trained.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Grytsku/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Is it more difficult to get a problem with an EV car resolved because there are fewer expert mechanics? </strong>Edward Jones, Northamptonshire</p> <p>The good news with an electric vehicle is that there are fewer moving parts to go wrong, so service plans are correspondingly cheaper. \u201cWe estimate the cars are, on average, 25% cheaper to maintain,\u201d says Rice. \u201cThere\u2019s no oil to change at a service, no - requiring replacement after five years. Your brakes and tyres wear slightly less with the EV\u2019s more efficient regenerative braking. You will find savings not only in fuelling the vehicle but also servicing it.\u201d</p> <p>On the flip side, while EVs require less maintenance, they also require <em>different </em>maintenance. While 100% of the Renault dealer network are EV trained, across the industry the figures are mixed. According to research by the Institute of the Motor Industry, by the end of 2018, <a href=\"https://www.ingeniarecruitment.co.uk/according-to-imi-only-3-of-uk-technicians-are-qualified-to-work-on-evs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">only 3% of technicians were qualified to work on EVs</a>. While that sounds bad, it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that <a href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/news/motoring-news/twice-as-many-drivers-plan-to-go-electric-next-time-round/\" rel=\"nofollow\">fewer than 1% UK cars are pure electric</a> so, if anything, there are more technicians available per electric vehicle than there are for conventional cars.</p> <p>The downside is that most of these technicians are employed by mainstream dealerships, with relatively little EV expertise in backstreet garages. EVs are, however, selling in ever-larger numbers, and mechanics are not immune to market forces. More technicians will train on EVs because, slowly but surely, that\u2019s where the market is heading.</p> <p><em><strong>Curious to learn more about EVs?

Both he and <strong>Dr Norman Swan</strong> said that once a lockdown ended there would be a resurgence, so any lockdown would effectively have to be sustained, or repeated, until a vaccine was available. </li> \n   <li>Kelly said that is why closing schools is such a big step \u2014 <strong>they would likely be closed all year. </strong></li> \n   <li>They said that all eyes were on China, which has not reported a resurgence of cases since lifting its lockdown provisions. </li> \n   <li>Professor <strong>Sharon Lewin, </strong>the director of the Doherty Institute, said that there were no specific treatment options available for Covid-19 at this point but they were being widely tested. <strong>She was \u201coptimistic\u201d about the development of some anti-viral treatments</strong> that might suppress both the symptoms and the spread of the virus.</li> \n   <li><strong>Paul Kelly</strong> agreed that health authorities in Australia <strong>needed to be clearer with their messaging.</strong></li> \n   <li>Kelly said that the situation in Australia was <strong>not comparable to the situation in Italy</strong> because Australia has tested and diagnosed a large number of very mild cases, while Italy\u2019s first 1,000 reported cases were \u201cvery serious\u201d. That meant Italy had missed many more cases than Australia, he said. </li> \n   <li><strong>Testing criteria in Australia will change in the next week</strong> as the number of overseas travellers drops dramatically, Kelly says. Testing has to date been focused on overseas travellers, but mandatory quarantine requirements and travel bans mean the number of travellers arriving had fallen significantly.</li> \n   <li><strong>Norman Swan </strong>suggested Australia was <strong>still missing asymptomatic cases of Covid-19</strong>, because it was not testing widely enough.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>We will leave our Australia-specific coverage of the coronavirus crisis there for tonight.

That means that if you contact Centrelink today about wanting to apply for unemployment benefits, but are unable to complete your application, <strong>you will be back paid from that first contact</strong>. (The government actually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/13/coalition-warned-welfare-overhaul-could-worsen-poverty-and-unemployment\">abolished this in 2018 to save money</a>.)</p> \n  <p>Crucially, Robert said <strong>people starting a new Jobseeker Payment claim could verify their identity over the phone,</strong> rather than by submitting their documents at a Centrelink office. This change was slated for April and has apparently been brought forward.</p> \n  <p>That is, <strong>you do not need to go to a Centrelink office to complete your claim</strong>. In fact, Robert said there were fewer staff at the shopfronts due to social distancing rules.</p> \n  <p>This does not get around the fact that getting through over the phone to Centrelink can take hours, let alone at a time like this.</p> \n  <p>Robert also said he was extending Centrelink call centre opening hours to 8am to 8pm (NSW time). The government is hiring up to 5,000 new staff at Services Australia to cater with demand, but it remains to be seen how quickly these employees can start.</p> \n  <p>Now, onto the <strong>MyGov website</strong>. Robert said the website suffered a DDoS attack (when a website is flooded with hits, essentially a cyber attack) but wouldn\u2019t give any more details.</p> \n  <p>He said the government had MyGov\u2019s upgraded capacity by 10 times. It could now operate with 55,000 concurrent users and, he said, in fact the website never crashed.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-23T03:14:30.207Z\">at 3.14am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7826a58f08a08573fbf8d1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-23T03:02:14.290Z\">3.02am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Australia has<strong> 1609 </strong>cases of Covid-19.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-23T03:05:17.000Z\">at 3.05am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7826028f08dcc95cc21451\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-23T03:00:15.861Z\">3.00am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The bells are ringing for question time.</p> \n  <p>Given that this is not the politics live blog, I\u2019ll be doing it a little differently than usual (I mean, it is 2o20, and nothing is the same right now) and only bringing you the main points, as we continue to monitor all the Covid-19 changes. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-23T03:06:05.595Z\">at 3.06am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7825a58f08e0999e6b8461\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-23T02:58:28.423Z\">2.58am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>For anyone who needs some soothing, there are these photos (from before she was in isolation):</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AlexMLeo/status/1241708286921056258\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Merkel buying 4 bottles of wine &amp;

Many health groups and medical associations have been calling for increased support to roll out the technology more widely and rapidly.<br><br>The federal government<a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/covid-19-national-health-plan-primary-care-bulk-billed-mbs-telehealth-services\"> introduced temporary Medicare Benefits Schedule and Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs items to allow doctors, nurses, midwives and mental health professionals to deliver services via telehealth</a>, provided those services are bulk billed, so that people in self-isolation or quarantine can get health care.<br><br><strong>This is a temporary six-month measure</strong>. People who meet the testing guidelines for Covid-19, people aged over 70, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged over 50, people with chronic health conditions or who are immunocompromised, and parents with new babies and people who are pregnant can access the bulk-billed Telehealth services.<br><br><strong>The thousands of doctors who have signed the letter say this is too restrictive.</strong><br><br>It comes \u201cwith special criteria that make it so ineffective it\u2019s practically useless,\u201d the letter says. \u201cDefining \u2018special groups\u2019 who are eligible for bulk-billed telehealth, leaving all others out in the cold - when normally all medical care attracts a rebate is simply un-Australian and tone deaf, especially when many of our community are losing their jobs and facing<br>financial hardship.<br><br>\u201cThe symptoms of coronavirus are identical to those of many other viruses. As the virus spreads in the community, it will be increasingly difficult to tell them all apart. By allowing telehealth access for all it will enable pre-emptive remote screening, without the risk of onward transmission. Telehealth access for all will also reduce the rush on the dedicated coronavirus screening clinics and lessen the impact on public hospitals \u2013 allowing them to focus on those who are acutely ill.\u201d<br><br>The Consumers Health Forum agrees telehealth should be supported across as many accredited health services as possible to reduce the demand in clinics and hospitals.<br><br>\u201cWe urge the Government to act on the advice of doctors, nurses and allied health practitioners and expand Medicare to cover telehealth services so clinicians can provide maximum help at minimal risk to many more patients and not just to known coronavirus risks,\u201d Consumer Health Forum CEO, <strong>Leanne Well</strong>s, said.<br><br>\u201cThe current limited availability of Medicare-funded telehealth services to specified patient groups represents a lost opportunity to reduce the hazards for clinicians and patients of direct physical consultation and of unnecessary patient travel, while encouraging consumers to seek vital attention.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e78236e8f08e0999e6b8454\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-23T02:48:47.688Z\">2.48am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mpbowers/status/1241919455828955136\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Craig Kelly-social isolation <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianAus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@GuardianAus</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmyRemeikis?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AmyRemeikis</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/murpharoo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@murpharoo</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/politicslive?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#politicslive</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ghPpng06wH\">pic.twitter.com/ghPpng06wH</a></p>\u2014 Mikearoo (@mpbowers) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mpbowers/status/1241919455828955136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 23, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>In terms of views, this is where he sits on a lot of issues, despite the airtime he is given. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7822a58f08e0999e6b8450\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-23T02:47:14.090Z\">2.47am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>On the Queensland border closure, I am being told that it will be similar to what we are seeing in WA and Tasmania, which means forced 14 day isolation, plus closures to non-essential visitors.</p> \n  <p>Where this will get tricky is the border with NSW, which operates a lot like a grey zone, with people travelling to one state for work and another to live. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7822448f08a08573fbf8bd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-23T02:44:41.089Z\">2.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Paul_Karp/status/1241917985062715392\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">ACT CMO Kerry Coleman says there are 13 new cases in the ACT, all returning from overseas or close contacts.

This infection spreads easily and causes significant symptoms in many. Elderly and those with chronic disease appear most at risk but younger and fitter patients are also affected and will act as carriers.</p> \n  <p>Almost all medical appointments currently only receive Medicare rebates if they are face-to-face. This means that patients have to physically see the doctor and sit in the waiting room among other patients. This increases the risk of contracting coronavirus. With new social distancing measures, medical clinics are exempt and people are still in very close contact with each other.</p> \n  <p>Many of the things that Australians go to the doctor for can be managed without a face-to-face appointment.

That idiosyncratic style of his, back straight, carriage low, arms tucked, legs spinning so quick his gold spikes were like sparks from a Catherine wheel. He had a technique all of his own and maybe that explained why he was so fast. He finished in 19.32sec, three-tenths ahead of his own world record. The man in second place, Frankie Fredericks, ran faster than any one else ever had and he finished five metres back.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/22/my-favourite-game-manchester-united-v-brighton-1983-fa-cup-final-replay\">My favourite game:  Manchester United v Brighton, 1983 FA Cup final replay | Philip Cornwall</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over the next decade, no one got near. Tyson Gay ran it in 19.62, Xavier Carter in 19.63, Wallace Spearmon in 19.65.

There was another wannabe contender, a 20-year-old lean streak from Jamaica called Usain Bolt \u2013 a lazy trainer, they said, but lightning quick in the juniors.</p> <p>Bolt broke the 100m world record in May, two months before the Beijing Games. Then that Sunday night in Beijing, he did it again, in the Olympic final. You remember it, everyone does, how he started like a runaway armoire but gathered up so much track in the middle metres he stopped sprinting and spread his arms down wide, then turned to the crowd and slapped his hand against his chest as he came up to the finish line. There are lots of athletes who are so good they make winning look easy, very few so good they really find it so.

The 200m mark, Johnson\u2019s impossible 19.32sec, was the one he wanted. Some day, maybe, Johnson said, but not now, not yet. Bolt did not have the speed endurance, he said, or the technique to handle running the curve, not at the levels he would need to beat that time. And who knew better? So far all he had done was trot through the heats and here he was clowning around on the start line without a care in the world.</p> <p>Then the gun went. His start was smooth and fluid, by midway around the curve Bolt had made up the stagger on the four men outside him, by the end of the curve he was metres ahead of them, and now it was just him racing history, chasing Johnson\u2019s ghost.</p> <p>Bolt was out there on the very limits of possibility, pushing, pushing, pushing. This time he did not slow, there was no early celebration, he even threw his head and chest ahead in a dip finish. The clock stopped on 19.30sec. He had done it by two hundredths. I remember thinking, up in the stands: \u201cSo this is what it looks like when God tries for the line.\u201d</p>",

But we\u2019re beginning to see that coronavirus can make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/dont-take-any-chances-warning-of-woman-with-covid-19-shared-online\">some younger people seriously ill</a>. Crucially, although the majority of younger people and children will develop symptoms little worse than flu, they could be invisible carriers of the virus \u2013 and play a key role in its spread.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When you can\u2019t easily tell if someone has a cold or coronavirus, infection control is far more difficult</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Compared to other European countries, the UK was slow in closing schools \u2013 waiting until there had already been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough\">104 deaths due to coronavirus</a> to take action. Studies from China showed children were <a href=\"http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/fileCCDCW/journal/article/ccdcw/2020/8/PDF/COVID-19.pdf\">rarely diagnosed with novel coronavirus</a>, and therefore presumably had little role in the spread of the disease.</p> <p>But most of the diagnostic efforts in China, especially in the early phases of the outbreak, were heavily skewed towards hospital admissions. The majority of hospitalised cases <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762130\">involved adult patients</a>. Did this mean that children and young people weren\u2019t infected, or merely that they suffered more mild symptoms, which were going undetected?</p> <p>Like many of my colleagues, I could see no obvious reason why children weren\u2019t being infected: this was a virus spread by the respiratory route, not through a process unique to adults. If significant numbers of children <em>were</em> infected and suffered very minor cold-like symptoms, then their potential to spread the virus was immense.</p> <p>One of the key differences between the novel coronavirus and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/experience-of-sars-key-factor-in-response-to-coronavirus\">S</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/experience-of-sars-key-factor-in-response-to-coronavirus\">ars</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/15/mers-next-global-pandemic\">M</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/15/mers-next-global-pandemic\">ers</a> is that people with Covid-19 may have only mild symptoms \u2013 making it more difficult to detect. With Sars, most people infected quickly developed pneumonia. Identifying and isolating people with severe symptoms is a relatively easy task, and this made infection control through case identification and contact tracing comparatively easy.</p> <p>The current coronavirus is different. In more than 85% of confirmed cases symptoms can go undetected or be easily confused with the common cold of mild flu. Its biggest weapon \u2013 the thing that has, <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/13/science.abb3221\">according to one study</a>, allowed it to spread so easily \u2013 is this ability to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/06/hidden-coronavirus-cases-could-thwart-containment-efforts-experts-warn\">cause mild disease</a> in the majority of people it infects. When you can\u2019t easily tell if someone has a cold or coronavirus, case identification and infection control are far more difficult.</p> <p>Far from being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/21/what-we-know-about-coronavirus-so-far-and-how-it-can-affect-your-child\">uninfected by this virus</a>, children could in fact be its unseen carriers, important links in community transmission chains. But there\u2019s still an important piece of the jigsaw missing. While many of us suspect that children have a key role to play in this outbreak, hard evidence to support this belief is still lacking.</p> <p>In perhaps the largest <a href=\"https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2020/03/16/peds.2020-0702.full.pdf\">study</a> of its type, Chinese researchers examined infection outcomes in more than 2,000 confirmed or suspected childhood cases of Covid-19. Just over half of the children had mild cold-like symptoms, or no symptoms at all.</p> <p>Severe and critical diseases, where body oxygen levels are low and various organs are under threat, were seen in around 5% of the children studied, with the youngest (under one year old) most at risk. There are still significant gaps in this analysis. Importantly, most of these were suspected rather than confirmed Covid-19 cases. But this study does at least reaffirm that most infections in children are mild.</p> <p>Judging from past pandemics, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-uk-schools-to-be-closed-indefinitely-and-exams-cancelled\">school closures</a> can be an effective way to reduce the spread of a virus \u2013 particularly when they form part of a larger programme of social distancing measures. Every school day, children congregate en masse, often in close proximity, and then return home, taking with them any new infection they\u2019ve picked up. Intuitively, reducing this cycle should help slow the virus.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/23/covid-19-activists-helping-elderly-vulnerable-people-political\">The fight against Covid-19 is being waged street by street | Zoe Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By assuming that the young and healthy weren\u2019t at risk, the UK government may have underestimated the effects of coronavirus. Indeed, reports of hospital admissions show that even among younger people this is a virus that can cause serious disease. A <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2.htm?s_cid=mm6912e2_w\">study</a> from the US shows that 38% of 508 patients hospitalised with coronavirus were aged between 20 and 54 (children under 19 accounted for less than 1% of the total admissions). Of these 508 patients, 121 were admitted to intensive care; nearly half of this group was under 65.</p> <p>As with most things in this pandemic, the idea that coronavirus only threatens older people is an oversimplification. Younger people and children are less likely to die from coronavirus, but their mild symptoms could make them contagious carriers of the virus \u2013 and they are more difficult to spot.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Ball is professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham</p>",

  "<p>The old adage about writing what you know has fallen out of fashion as advice for new writers, but it\u2019s served Jessica Moor well in her first novel, <em>Keeper</em>, the story of a murder investigation that centres on a women\u2019s refuge. Moor was inspired to write about her experiences of working with victims of domestic violence, and <em>Keeper</em> explores how abuse can rob women of their lives in more ways than one.</p> <p>Katie Straw, a young worker at a refuge in the north-western town of Widringham, is found dead in the river after apparently jumping from the bridge. DS Daniel Whitworth had hoped to reach his imminent retirement \u201cwithout having to deal with another corpse\u201d, though at least this one looks like an open-and-shut suicide, since Katie\u2019s boyfriend \u2013 the obvious suspect \u2013 has an alibi. It\u2019s only when Whitworth discovers that Katie was living under a false identity that he realises he might have to start paying attention to the women at the refuge, none of whom \u2013 with good reason \u2013 has much faith in the law\u2019s ability to listen.</p> <p>The novel unfolds using several voices, and across two time frames, which is occasionally confusing. Moor follows the individual stories of the women in the refuge, so different from one another in age and background, but thrown together in uneasy solidarity by the experience that binds them \u2013 the violence of a man close to them. There are also flashbacks to Katie\u2019s earlier life and her previous relationship with a seemingly perfect man called Jamie.</p> <p>These strands are intercut with chapters following Whitworth\u2019s investigation, which are the weakest elements of the novel; the author is less certain of her material here, and Whitworth never quite achieves more than two dimensions as a character.</p> <p>But the novel really comes to life when she tells the women\u2019s stories. Katie\u2019s relationship with Jamie is chilling in its creep towards coercive control, a form of abuse only recently recognised in law but familiar in fiction and drama, from the 1938 play <em>Gas Light</em> to Louise Doughty\u2019s recent novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/22/platform-seven-by-louise-doughty-review\" title=\"\"><em>Platform Seven</em></a>.</p> <p>Moor skilfully avoids the danger of making the novel too didactic and allows her female characters to speak for themselves. She presents a spectrum of male violence, from a Twitter trolling campaign of violent rape threats against the refuge, to the male detectives\u2019 dismissive response, through the various instances of physical and emotional control and ultimately murder.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day a hundred and fifty women in this country are turned away from refuges. Two hundred children too.\u201d It\u2019s an almost off-hand comment made by Val, the director of the women\u2019s shelter, but it stayed with me as one of the most frightening moments in this atmospheric, timely debut.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Keeper</em> by Jessica Moor<em> </em>is published by Penguin (\u00a314.99).

  "<p>While many of us worldwide are unable to experience live music during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus crisis</a>, or even socialise as normal, we can still use streaming services. Now is the time to delve into that artist you\u2019ve always wanted to check out more deeply \u2013 but where to start?</p> <p>This week we\u2019re starting a new series to run during the outbreak (and potentially beyond it) called Listener\u2019s Digest, in which our writers guide you through the back catalogues of various musicians. These aren\u2019t designed to be exhaustive or definitive, but helpful signposts to get you started in some of the world\u2019s most exhilarating bodies of popular music. We kick off with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kraftwerk\">Kraftwerk</a>, and coming up in week one we will have Rihanna, the Fall, Alice Coltrane and Sleater-Kinney. We\u2019ll include a 10-song primer playlist with each, in Spotify and Apple Music.</p> <h2>The album to start with</h2> <p><strong>Computer World (1981)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pgf7Uz7Xxek\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Pgf7Uz7Xxek?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Kraftwerk, who formed in 1970 in D\u00fcsseldorf and were a major force in making synths and drum machines the lingua franca of pop, dance and hip-hop, are often named alongside the Beatles as the world\u2019s most important and influential groups. In a UK still guilty of stereotyping Germans as efficient and cool \u2013 and the group themselves slyly playing up to that \u2013 they are also often dismissed as a heritage act of eccentric boffins. But these reputations belie what is actually a playful, romantic, rapturously melodic body of work, exemplified perfectly by Computer World.</p> <p>With only seven tracks \u2013 six really, with the title track in two parts \u2013 it is one of the greatest albums of pop melody ever. These tunes are so satisfyingly sturdy and logical \u2013 reminiscent of the ringtones and corporate sonic motifs that they helped to usher in \u2013 but also spectrally beautiful.</p> <p>As a kind of concept album imagining, and indeed enacting, a digitally mediated future, there are moments of disquiet. Computer Love pre-empts the eerie contradictions of online dating; the title track coldly lists \u201cInterpol and Deutsche Bank, FBI and Scotland Yard\u201d, the lack of explanation hinting at the rampant subterfuge of the information age.</p> <p>But it mostly acts as techno-evangelism. One track title announces It\u2019s More Fun to Compute, like a bumper sticker; vocalist Ralf Hutter notes with childlike glee on Pocket Calculator, \u201cby pressing down a special key it plays a little melody\u201d. On Home Computer, he sounds like a dad unboxing his first PC: \u201cI program my home computer / beam myself into the future\u201d, he murmurs wondrously. The music, of course, is already there.</p> <h2>The three albums to check out next</h2> <p><strong>Trans-Europe Express (1977)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_85fUIRlmU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/i_85fUIRlmU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Listening to this album post-Brexit is deeply poignant. The opening track, Europe Endless, like their first hit Autobahn, evokes a freedom of movement that was then so deeply cherished after the second world war. The title track (plus its clattering counterparts Metal on Metal and Abzug) celebrates the unstoppable force of cross-continental rail travel, though its sterner mien hints at noirish escapades. Elsewhere there is psychological horror, done in pure pop (Showroom Dummies) and drifting ambient (The Hall of Mirrors). Again, the melodies have a purity that harks back to the classical era of Franz Schubert, namechecked here.</p> <p><strong>The Man Machine (1978)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68d8GRgiec4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/68d8GRgiec4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>If they were previously Showroom Dummies coming to life, now they were The Robots, \u201cdancing mechanik\u201d: an announcement of their growing sophistication. Just as on Computer World and Radio-Activity (1975) \u2013 which found communication and nuclear technologies both fascinating and troubling \u2013 the tension is in their simultaneous enthusiasm and wariness of technology. The Robots\u2019 promise \u2013 \u201cWe are programmed just to do / anything you want us to\u201d \u2013 feels like a malevolently taunting lie, but Spacelab and Neon Lights are beautifully benign. The Model, meanwhile, suggests that there is only melancholy to be found in flesh and blood.</p> <p><strong>Tour de France Soundtracks (2003)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=invtIKKl2Hw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/invtIKKl2Hw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>One of Kraftwerk\u2019s greatest triumphs is to move with the times, keeping their Kling Klang studio updated rather than becoming a nostalgic analogue synth museum.

Any paranoia has disappeared entirely: the whole album whirrs with happy industry, and a wonder in the blend of science, topography and physical effort that makes up the Tour.</p> <h2>One for the heads</h2> <p><strong>Dentaku (taken from Minimum-Maximum, 2005)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-X60uZbWcc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/e-X60uZbWcc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Kraftwerk have spent the post-Tour years touring themselves, with a superb 3D setup for the greatest hits.

The Bush administration achieved the first by passing the Patriot Act, which built the foundation for what is probably the world\u2019s most <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/issues/national-security/privacy-and-surveillance/surveillance-under-patriot-act\">expansive surveillance state</a>, but also by setting legal precedents that <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/george-w-bush-vs-the-constitution/\">violated basic constitutional rights</a> and by creating the Department for Homeland Security, with its <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-citizens-ice-20180427-htmlstory.html\">aggressive</a> constituent agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The second goal was achieved with the \u201cwar on terror\u201d, which involved unilateral occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq, and subsequent <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/02/secret-war-africa-pentagon-664005\">military forays</a> into many African countries. In Iraq, private security, logistics and reconstruction contractors <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7f435f04-8c05-11e2-b001-00144feabdc0\">swallowed up</a> $138bn alone. Since 2001, $5.9tn in taxpayer dollars have <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/14/us-has-spent-5point9-trillion-on-middle-east-asia-wars-since-2001-study.html\">gone toward</a> wars (not to mention resulted in <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/11/19/civilian-casualties-us-war-on-terror/\">hundreds of thousands of deaths</a> and a foreign policy blackhole that still haunts the Middle East). Neither of these goals addressed the root cause of the crisis, and <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/terrorism\">arguably exacerbated</a> the conditions that led to 9/11.</p> <p>The second national emergency my generation experienced was the 2008 housing bubble collapse and subsequent recession: the most severe economic meltdown since the Great Depression. Again the federal government, this time under Barack Obama\u2019s administration, sought to exploit the crisis to move vast wealth from the public treasury into private bank accounts. A <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2009/12/real-size-bailout-treasury-fed/\">staggering $14tn</a> was transferred from taxpayers to private hands, including Wall Street executives who used that money to continue giving themselves seven-figure bonuses. One of the largest recipients of bailout money, Citigroup, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jul/31/wall-street-bonuses-bailout\">paid out $5.3bn</a> to employees in bonuses. While the federal government debatably halted a further stock market collapse, they certainly did not address the root cause of the crisis. A mere 11 years later and we are again standing on the edge of a major economic crisis.</p> <p>Ecological devastation, meanwhile, is the quiet crisis amplifier that has persisted through both of these national emergencies and cast a shadow over the whole of my generation. Its latest iteration is the Covid-19 pandemic, <a href=\"https://grist.org/climate/a-common-germ-pool-the-frightening-environmental-origins-of-covid-19/\">whose origins lay</a> in habitat destruction and biodiversity loss.</p> <p>Once again, the federal government appears poised to exploit this emergency to expand executive power and move wealth from the public treasury into private bank accounts. As the Nation <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/society/coronavirus-trump-pandemic/\">recently reported</a>, an internal CBP directive empowers the agency to indefinitely monitor and detain anyone suspected of carrying the virus. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has <a href=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/trump-oil-industry-coronavirus-2645487635.html?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1\">begun a bailout</a> for the oil industry, which could exceed $2.6bn in tax dollars going to oil industry control, and is <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2020/03/18/coronavirus-travel-bailout-trump-says-airlines-would-no-1/2867020001/\">toying with</a> the idea of an airline industry bailout, which could exceed $50bn.</p> <p>The authoritarian lockdowns in China and Italy may soon arrive to the anglophone world. Seeing self-avowed leftists and liberals praising such draconian reactions is frightening. Anyone who cares about democracy and civil liberty should not welcome such responses. As we witnessed with the authoritarian reactions to 9/11, emergency violations of civil liberties are not easily rolled back, and often aggregate over time. In the wake of 9/11, Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act, which gave sweeping powers to the executive branch. In 2012, Obama signed an expanded version into law, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/05/01/ndaa-2018-aumf-detention/\">which gave the president the power</a> to \u201chold individuals, including US citizens, in military detention indefinitely\u201d, which means for life. We must reject such authoritarian measures wholly, no matter who says they\u2019re \u201cnecessary\u201d.</p> <p>The fact is, neither expanding executive power nor redistributing wealth upward will save lives or address the root cause of the crisis. In fact, both the oil and airline industries are accelerating the ecological devastation at the heart of this pandemic. As ecological collapse continues to unfold, more and more emergencies like this will occur with greater frequency and intensity. Now is the time to break out of the recurring pattern in which national responses not only fail to solve the problem, but even exacerbate the original cause, while transferring wealth from taxpayers to already-wealthy, well-connected executives. Instead, now is the time to implement a set of standards for what constitutes a response that puts the common good at the center.</p> <p>In the case of this virus, there are plenty of good ideas already being discussed that would do exactly that. Instead of moving public wealth into private corporations, the government should be doing the opposite.</p> <p>The first step to containing this virus is handing out cash to every American to fund their ability to self-isolate without having to go to work. A basic income of, at minimum, subsistence rate would achieve this. The New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/13/andrew-yang-aoc-free-ubi-cash-can-help-during-coronavirus-pandemic.html\">has called</a> for implementing an emergency universal basic income, while presidential candidate Bernie Sanders <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-bernie-sanders-calls-for-monthly-2000-cash-payments-2020-3\">suggested delivering</a> a monthly $2,000 check to every household to deal with lost income.</p> <p>Providing universal healthcare, both during the virus flareup and after, would also go a long way to containing its spread and reducing its seasonal intensity; the for-profit system is <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2020/02/26/americas-patchwork-for-profit-healthcare-system-poised-to-worsen-coronavirus-outbreak/\">probably exacerbating</a> the spread of the virus. Subsidizing or even nationalizing essential goods and services like utilities, pharmaceuticals and distribution of basic necessities could also help contain the virus and reduce its negative long-term impacts, and ensure that those services remain available to all. The Trump administration has (surprisingly) <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/488227-trump-orders-hud-to-suspend-evictions-and-foreclosures\">ordered</a> the Department of Housing and Urban Development to halt evictions and foreclosures temporarily. Taking that further and reforming or eliminating them, even past the worst of the pandemic, could help soften conditions leading to virus spreading in the future.</p> <p>Interim support for local services, like small businesses and charities, would also help keep local infrastructure intact beyond the most intense phases of social isolation. Dismantling the prison industrial complex and deeply reforming the justice system would help as well. The US has the highest incarceration rate and absolute prison population in the world. Abolishing the institution would go a long way toward reducing the impact of highly infectious viruses, given that prisons are \u201c<a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/03/correctional-facilities-are-the-perfect-incubators-for-the-coronavirus/\">the perfect incubators</a>\u201d for coronaviruses. Finally, bypassing intellectual property laws with regard to vaccine development, and preventing anyone from limiting access for private profit, would also be important, both now and beyond the pandemic.</p> <p>Of course the best thing we can do is halt the twin ecological and climate crises that are now driving so many existential emergencies like the Covid-19 pandemic. But, in the meantime of attending to that herculean task, the least we can be doing is agreeing on a set of responses that reject authoritarian exercises of executive power and the further enrichment of the already wealthy at the expense of the public. Instead, we should be responding to such national crises by saving lives and fortifying the common good. Through a series of compounding national emergencies, a benevolent response would be the first my generation has ever witnessed.</p> <ul> <li><p>Samuel Miller McDonald studies climate and energy politics at Oxford University</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Retirees David and Denise Morse were celebrating their 45th wedding anniversary with a 15-day trip aboard the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/from-paradise-to-coronavirus-the-grand-princess-and-the-cruise-from-hell\">Grand Princess cruise liner</a> when 19 crew members and two passengers aboard the ship were diagnosed with the coronavirus.</p> <p>The original itinerary had the Morses arriving in Ensenada, Mexico, from Hawaii on 5 March, and returning home to San Francisco two days later. Instead, the cruise liner was held off the San Francisco coast for several days, until it docked in the Port of Oakland on 9 March.</p> <p>The 2,000 passengers on board disembarked over the course of three days. More than 800 California residents were sent to Travis air force base in Fairfield, about 47 miles north-east of San Francisco , to serve out a 14-day quarantine.</p> <p>David and Denise are keeping a diary documenting their stay there.</p> <h2><strong>11 March</strong></h2> <p><strong>David, 10.</strong><strong>35</strong><strong>am \u2013</strong><strong> </strong>I don\u2019t know what this is going to be \u2013 a journal, story or what. I just wanted to write down some of the many thoughts I have had as we go through this surreal ordeal.<strong> </strong>We are on the fourth floor of the Westwind Inn hotel, on the property of Travis air force base. Got in our room at 9.30pm last night, after a long day that started at 6am on the ship.</p> <p>We had been dressed and ready to depart our stateroom C314 on the 10th floor, at 7am. The ship had arrived in Oakland the previous day, and passengers had begun disembarking \u2013 the sick and elderly first. We couldn\u2019t see much from what was going on. All the action was on the starboard side, and we were on port.</p> <p>We waited more than six hours for our turn today. My impression is that Princess Cruises is very experienced in handling large groups, feeding, giving instructions and disembarking procedures. They have it together. On the land, it\u2019s more politically and medically challenging, as officials have to coordinate between cities, states and the federal government.</p> <p>This morning, we thought we had to get up for our coronavirus test at 7.15am. On 6 March, Vice-President Pence had announced that everyone disembarking from the boat would be tested for coronavirus.</p> <p>We scrambled to the elevator area, only to find that the staff were handing out breakfast boxes. So, no testing. At 9.30am, they gave us a temperature check and symptom questions. We were told we would be tested only if we show symptoms. Is that because there is a shortage of testing supplies?</p> <p>We went downstairs and found a large group of masked passengers in line for coffee and using their bare hands to get juice cartons and breakfast boxes.</p> <h2><strong>12 March</strong></h2> <p><strong>David, 8.</strong><strong>55am \u2013</strong><strong> </strong>There are 846 Californians in our four-story hotel at Travis air force base. The majority are elderly folks, many using canes, walkers, wheelchairs and scooters. Medical staff takes our temperatures twice a day. We asked again to be tested for Covid-19 and learned this morning from a medical staff person that they do not have test kits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5eb3897c919b58ba81d22509b1868094630fcca8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5eb3897c919b58ba81d22509b1868094630fcca8/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Morse\u2019s room at the Westwind Inn hotel on Travis air force base in Fairfield, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Morse\u2019s room at the Westwind Inn hotel on Travis air force base in Fairfield, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David and Denise Morse/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is likely that there are folks among us with the virus. We are advised to wash hands, wear our masks, stay six feet from others, and not gather in large groups. However, we have large groups standing close to each other in line to pick up their food boxes. We\u2019ve seen people pick up a box, look at it, then choose another box.</p> <p>We skipped coffee this morning because to get coffee you have to stand in a line, then use your bare hands to separate a cup from a stack of cups and dispense coffee from a community container. I asked a medical staff person why not have staff dispense the coffee, noting they all have gloves. She said there is not enough staff.</p> <p>I feel that each day we stay here we increase our chances of contracting the virus. Denise and I are doing our best to protect ourselves and stay positive. We are healthy and know that we will do well if we get the virus. We don\u2019t take the elevators; we try to stay away from groups of people. We exercise. I do tai chi every day and Denise meditates every day.</p> <p><strong>Denise, 2pm \u2013</strong><strong> </strong>I spent much of yesterday and today talking to political folks about the conditions here, calling the offices of California senators Diane Feinstein and Kamala Harris and congressman John Garamendi.</p> <p>We were feeling rather discouraged about the health and safety situation. But things are improving. At noon they started delivering our meals to our rooms.</p> <p><strong>David, 3</strong><strong>.40</strong><strong>pm \u2013</strong> What a day. Another passenger and I were outside playing Five Foot Two on the ukuleles we got on the cruise ship. A military guy politely approached us and said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt, but I have orders to ask you to return to your room.\u201d I don\u2019t know why. Off to our room.</p> <p>There is no alcohol allowed here. But we have a few small bottles from the ship. Just had Jack and coke, made Denise a gin and tonic without ice or limes.</p> <h2><strong>13 March</strong></h2> <p><strong>David, 9</strong><strong>.02</strong><strong>am \u2013</strong><em> </em>We are getting acquainted with how things work here. Yesterday at the reception area in the lobby I asked a friendly service woman if we could have some shampoo. She said, \u201cYou know, soap is fine.\u201d I said \u201cOK, could we have some soap?\u201d She said, \u201cSorry, we are out of soap.\u201d Later I asked another staff member for some soap. She gave me a small bottle of shampoo.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f263270a7186bbcdc6ec54ae16ead077a2ed33db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f263270a7186bbcdc6ec54ae16ead077a2ed33db/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The view from the Morse\u2019s fourth-floor room at the Westwind Inn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The view from the Morses\u2019 fourth-floor room at the Westwind Inn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David and Denise Morse/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This morning, after complimenting the staff on how they are now dispensing the box meals to our rooms, I complained that coffee is still grab and go, as are juice, water, cream and sugar.</p> <p>A few minutes later a staff member knocked at our door and said the commander of the quarantine operation would like to talk to me. Denise and I thought, \u201cOh no, now we are in trouble.\u201d We met Nate Contreras, who informed us that he is in charge of 60 staff, who serve food, deliver medications, take our temperatures and respond to any passenger\u2019s medical issue. He was friendly and wanted to hear our concerns. He explained that he didn\u2019t have enough staff to dispense coffee, but he has asked for more.</p> <p>We asked for more hand-washing stations, signs and hand sanitizer. The only place we can wash our hands is in our rooms. We suggested they give us packets for the coffee makers we have in our rooms, he said he would look into it. Surprise: we were not in trouble.</p> <p><strong>Denise, 9</strong><strong>am \u2013</strong><strong> </strong>We got our first official Travis air force base newsletter today. Here\u2019s what they said about testing: <em>Everyone here will have the opportunity to be tested for Covid-19. You are not required to be tested. It will be your choice. If you choose to be tested, it is important that you understand that if the results of your test are pending, then it is possible it may delay your departure.</em></p> <p><strong>David, 10</strong><strong>.30</strong><strong>am</strong> \u2013 23 March is the first day of spring and supposedly the end of our 14-day quarantine. We have nine days to go; this testing statement sounds like it is a feeble attempt to be able to claim that passengers were offered the opportunity to be tested. What would you do?</p> <p>Here is our list of needs: a blanket (we have a one-sheet cover on our bed and it\u2019s cold in here), coffee, replacement light bulb for the light on our bed stand, hand soap and laundry detergent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"67eacf75bee1aa6be3d75ecdfc619061429d0c68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67eacf75bee1aa6be3d75ecdfc619061429d0c68/0_44_720_900/400.jpg\" alt=\"Denise Morse out for a walk on the grounds of Westwind Inn.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Denise Morse out for a walk on the grounds of Westwind Inn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David and Denise Morse/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>14 March</strong></h2> <p><strong>David, 8.</strong><strong>03</strong><strong>am \u2013</strong> Denise and I are healthy and in good spirits. We got another newsletter today. It repeats the same testing instructions we saw yesterday, which seem like a threat rather than an option to be tested.</p> <p>We walked in the rain this morning. We have to walk on the lawn, as most of the sidewalks are outside the perimeter fence that surrounds the complex \u2013 with security guards in SUVs watching 24/7.</p> <h2><strong>16 March</strong></h2> <p><strong>Denise, 9</strong><strong>.30</strong><strong>am \u2013</strong><strong> </strong>Woke up at 6am. While David was doing the laundry down the hall, I made the bed and cleaned the bathroom with the hand sanitizer cloths that we had brought with us on the cruise ship. They are gold, and we only use them to clean surfaces in our room and bathroom. There are no cleaning supplies. We were told we could have a room cleaning, but we prefer to not have anyone in our room.</p> <p>We have decided not to be tested. Our rationale is we are in good health and show no symptoms. As required, we wear our masks when out of our room, stay six feet from individuals, don\u2019t touch handles. We take stairs and wash our hands for 20 seconds when we return to our room.</p> <h2><strong>15 March</strong></h2> <p><strong>Denise, 9</strong><strong>.31</strong><strong>am \u2013</strong><strong> </strong>Up at 7am. Our floor medical person took our temp at 8.30 \u2013 normal. We have acquired some coffee, so David made coffee in our room. Breakfast was lighter this morning: bagel, cream cheese, banana, option for yogurt and a ketchup pack (what for?).</p> <p>The daily<strong> </strong>2pm conference call with federal officials from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) left us confused and worried. They announced there have been two confirmed cases among passengers assigned to this facility. They said those with close contact with those individuals have been informed; no need to be concerned. They have begun testing those who asked to be tested \u2013 only 30% of those at Travis ended up wanting a test. Those who got tested are still waiting for results.</p> <p>Dinner served at 6.40pm included a hamburger bun with a piece of yellow cheese, sliced tomato and a piece of lettuce. I asked if there was anything else and the man who delivered it said no. So we used the microwave in our room to heat up the bun and cheese. Wasn\u2019t that bad, but it was not many calories. Twenty minutes later, there was a knock on the door and we were given two more boxes with a bare hamburger patty and fries. Too bad we had already eaten the cheese and bun.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2a2b21f4336daa0e67c137aea7d9d4983df2cb8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2a2b21f4336daa0e67c137aea7d9d4983df2cb8/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A meal served at Travis air force base.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A meal served at Travis air force base.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David and Denise Morse/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>17 March</strong></h2> <p><strong>Denise, 9</strong><strong>.30</strong><strong>am \u2013</strong><strong> </strong>We don\u2019t have a table for eating. We tried using the luggage rack with a towel on it but that proved to be too unstable. Now David eats at the desk and I sit on a leather chair and balance the container on my lap.</p> <p>We get many emails and texts. We find we need to take breaks from our telephones and from hearing about this pandemic.</p> <p>At the daily conference call, the doctor gave us more details about the two confirmed cases.<strong> </strong>One person was identified as having the virus while disembarking from the ship and was not brought to Travis. The other case was a couple that had mobility issues and one tested positive. They were not on the base long and were in their room, so exposure was minimal to others, the staff told us. A total of 37 confirmed cases as of today from the Grand Princess.</p> <p>When they brought our dinner, David put on some soothing classical music. We wish we had some wine.</p> <p>I want to say this staff has taken a lot of flak from many of us, me included. They have listened, and in most cases, followed up. I have seen changes and an almost daily effort and improvement, specifically around food and drink.</p> <p>At 8pm, we got a call from the front desk and we have two packages! It\u2019s like Christmas! David went down and just came up with two Amazon boxes. One box is from our son Jonathan: a large bag of M&amp;M\u2019s. The other box is from my sister: dental floss and body lotion. We\u2019re happy with these new items to add to our simple supply of \u201cextras\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>20 March</strong></h2> <p><strong>Denise, 5 pm \u2013 </strong>Bad news today. More people at Travis have tested positive. If they didn\u2019t get it on the ship, they probably may have gotten it here. The conditions the first few days were appalling.</p> <p><em>On 20 March, HHS confirmed that, with new test results still coming in, eight people at Travis had tested positive. Four of them were hospitalized with complications of Covid-19. One person was hospitalized for other reasons.</em></p> <p><em>\u201cEveryone that requested to be tested was tested,\u201d an HHS spokesperson said. \u201cThe government cannot force an asymptomatic person to be tested.\u201d</em></p> <p><em>In a statement, the department also emphasized that it is working to improve conditions for the Grand Princess passengers under quarantine.</em></p> <p><em>\u201cThis unprecedented response has presented significant logistical challenges that have affected passengers. During the first two days of this massive undertaking, HHS focused on screening passengers for symptoms, addressing any underlying health conditions, providing access to prescription medication, and getting passengers settled into their rooms. At each step of the way, plans and policies were adapted as necessary to accommodate specific problems at hand.\u201d</em></p> <p><em>\u201cThis is the first federal quarantine in nearly </em><em>60 years. HHS\u2019s number one priority is the health of the passengers, the people caring for them, and those in the surrounding communities. We continue to focus on hospitality issues, such as food service and housekeeping, to improve the comfort of our guests.\u201d</em></p>",
  "<p>At a time when questions of identity are fraught and thorny, there\u2019s something daring in the set-up of Sebastian Barry\u2019s <em>A Thousand Moons</em>. Continuing the sweepingly ambitious cycle of stories that draw on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/07/sebastian-barry-family-stories-mean-a-while-dofferent-thing-when-you-are-60\" title=\"\">a fictionalised version of his own family history</a>, Barry now turns to a minor figure from his previous novel, the Costa prize-winning <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/28/days-without-end-by-sebastian-barry-review\" title=\"\">Days Without End</a></em>. Winona is a member of the Lakota tribe \u2013 \u201cthe saddest people that ever were on the earth\u201d \u2013 rescued by Thomas McNulty (who narrated the last book) and his partner John Cole. That Barry knows he has strayed into tricksy territory is clear from the off. \u201cI am Winona,\u201d the novel begins, before immediately qualifying this seemingly simple statement of identity. It is Winona\u2019s fate to be adopted and re-presented by men, appropriation that points to the author\u2019s conflicted stance speaking with Winona\u2019s voice. \u201cIn early times I was Ojinjintka, which means rose. Thomas McNulty tried very hard to say this name, but he failed, and so he gave me my dead cousin\u2019s name because it was easier in his mouth. Winona means first-born. I was not first-born.\u201d</p> <p><em>A Thousand Moons </em>skips forward a few years from <em>Days Without End </em>and although it\u2019s in effect a sequel, the novel stands alone, wasting no time with backstory as it launches into its typically rollicking tale. It\u2019s now 1870 and McNulty and John Cole live together on a starvecrow farm outside of Paris, Tennessee. It\u2019s a kind of utopian oasis in the fractious post-civil war days. The farm is run by the decent, tight-lipped Lige Mason. Alongside McNulty, Cole and Winona \u2013 an orphan who is just \u201cthe cinders of an Indian fire\u201d \u2013 there are two former slaves, Rosalee and Tennyson Bouguereau. Danger is everywhere \u2013 from the \u201cnightriders\u201d led by the malevolent Zach Petrie to the dregs of the civil war that still haunt Paris: \u201cThe town was still full of rough Union soldiers kicking their heels, and the defeated butternut boys were a sort of secret presence, though they were not in their uniforms. Vagabonds on every little byway. And state militia watchful for those vagabonds.\u201d</p> <p>The greatest threat to the life of the farm, though, is the racism that means that Winona, Cole (whose \u201cgrandmother or the woman before his grandmother was an Indian person\u201d) and the Bouguereaus are never truly safe: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a crime to kill an Indian because an Indian wasn\u2019t anything in particular.\u201d Early on, Winona is raped in an attack of terrible brutality; she\u2019s plied with \u201cdistillery whiskey\u201d and is unable to remember who carried out the assault \u2013 although all signs point to a local man, Jas Joski, who refers to Winona as his fiancee. Then Tennyson Bouguereau is also attacked, and the fragile peace of the farm is shattered.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/07/sebastian-barry-family-stories-mean-a-while-dofferent-thing-when-you-are-60\">Sebastian Barry: \u2018Family stories mean a whole different thing in your 60s\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Winona sets out on a quest for revenge, dressed \u201cin boy\u2019s britches\u201d with a gun and a knife in her belt. Soon she\u2019s joined by a fiery Chippewa orphan girl, Peg, who becomes her lover. Barry handled scenes of McNulty and Cole cross-dressing in <em>Days Without End</em> immaculately; here, again, we understand the power conferred on Winona by her change in identity, the way she is suddenly able to move freely where she had previously been constrained. Her adventures take her on a journey that is horrifying, thrilling and enchanting in equal measure, all of it rendered in Barry\u2019s uniquely lyrical prose, which seems at once effortless and dense with meaning.</p> <p>This novel, like its predecessor, provides a compelling answer to those who claim that authors should stick to their own when it comes to telling stories. The idea of a middle-class white male writing in the voice of a cross-dressing teenage lesbian Native American might feel out of step with its times, but prose this good is a kind of enchantment, transcending the constructs that are supposed to define us to speak in a voice that is truly universal.</p> <p><em>\u2022 A Thousand Moons </em>by Sebastian Barry is published by Faber (\u00a318.99).

  "<p>This is probably the most requested dish in the Thai repertoire. So perhaps, for once, we should call it by its proper name: <em>guay teow pad Thai</em>, or \u201cnoodles stir-fried in the Thai style\u201d.</p> <p>How it became so widespread across Thailand is down to Plaek Phibunsongkhram, who came to power in 1938. In the process of protecting Siam\u2019s (as it was then) independence, he ordered the creation of a new national dish.</p> <p>Restaurants across the country were given the recipe; anyone with the inclination to open a pad Thai street food stall was provided with state help to do so.

  "<p>John McKie, who has died aged 80, was the man behind the Wee Stinker in the paper I still call <a href=\"https://www.heraldscotland.com/\">the Glasgow Herald</a>; I have never seen a solver\u2019s prize coveted as passionately as the Wee Stinker T-shirt.</p> <p>Some even claim to have amassed a small collection of the T-shirts over the years, having toiled at the Herald\u2019s puzzle, which, as its name suggests, has always been small (well, smallish: it\u2019s 13 x 13 squares), Scottish and very challenging.</p> <p>It started in 1988 when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/sep/11/guardianobituaries.robinmckie\">Herald\u2019s editor, Arnold Kemp</a>, decided that the paper could do with a stiffer challenge \u2013 much like the later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2013/jun/20/crossword-blog-thousandth-telegraph-toughie\">Telegraph Toughie</a>, to which McKie also contributed.</p> <p>McKie \u2013 AKA Myops, the Greek for gadfly \u2013 was already setting the Herald\u2019s Christmas jumbo and Saturday prize puzzles, but the Wee Stinker is unlike those or any other crosswords.</p> <p>For one thing, it\u2019s avowedly not for beginners and those in a hurry, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/series/quiptic\">to use a phrase we see around here</a>. Finishing the puzzle involves using Chambers dictionary (often for its Scottish-specific language) and sometimes the odd encyclopaedia. And, like Crosaire in the Irish Times, the Stinker does not follow quite the same rules as other puzzles.</p> <p>Here are some clues that give a sense of McKie\u2019s style. First, a straightforward multi-word clue with a cracking surface reading \u2026</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Smelling a rice wine and, swallowing it</em>, <strong>drunk</strong> (4,2,1,4)<br>[ <strong>wordplay</strong>: synonym for \u2018smelling\u2019 + A (\u2018a\u2019) + name of a rice wine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/apr/19/cryptic-crosswords-for-beginners-containers\">containing</a> IT (\u2018it\u2019) ]<br>[ HIGH + A + SAKE containing IT ]<br>[ <strong>definition</strong>: drunk ]</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2026 for HIGH AS A KITE and an example of a playfully cryptic \u201cdefinition\u201d \u2026</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em><strong>Title without peer in South Pacific</strong></em> (4)<br>[ reference to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljm9CDRAhMQ\">South Pacific song</a> ]</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2026 of DAME. Next, let\u2019s have one of those definitions you need to check \u2026</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Like this scent</strong>? (4)<br>[ <strong>definition 1</strong>: like this ]<br>[ <strong>definition 2</strong>: another name for frankincense ]</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2026 in this case, THUS and some non-obvious wordplay \u2026</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Vergil\u2019s art first grasped the meaning of</em> <strong>the underworld</strong> (5)<br>[ <strong>wordplay</strong>: Latin (\u2018Vergil\u2019s) \u2018art\u2019 (as a verb) preceded by (\u2018first\u2019) synonym for \u2018grasped the meaning of\u2019 ]<br>[ ES preceded by HAD ]<br>[ <strong>definition</strong>: the underworld ]</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2026 this time from <a href=\"https://puzzles.telegraph.co.uk/puzzle?puzzle_id=9018&amp;exitUrl=search_results\">a Toughie clue</a> for HADES.</p> <p>But what the Stinker solver needs to especially prep themselves for is the breaking of a rule followed almost everywhere else: that if the solver needs to make an anagram of a word, the setter puts it in the clue, rather than just hinting at it. From memory, here\u2019s an example \u2026</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Work out</em> <strong>colour</strong> (5)<br>[ <strong>wordplay</strong>: anagram (\u2018out\u2019) of synonym of \u2018work\u2019 ]<br>[ anagram of CHORE ]<br>[ <strong>definition</strong>: colour ]</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2026 cluing OCHRE. Elsewhere, this would be a no-no; within the Wee Stinker\u2019s world, it was just another device. Finally, there\u2019s <em>this</em>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>G-GAG (5,8)</p> </blockquote> <p>You could stare at that one for a long time, even with crossing letters. The thinking behind it is recounted in <a href=\"https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12705404.puzzled-perplexed-but-at-peace/\">a compelling 1993 Herald piece</a> that begins with McKie\u2019s wife, Lorna, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve nothing of interest to say\u201d and later recalling:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have a friend who is a pianist and John asked for her number \u2013 so I listened in, naturally, that\u2019s what wives do. I heard him ask what key you would play Happy Birthday in. She said if it was for a child it would be G. The clue in the Wee Stinker was G-GAG and the answer was Happy Birthday. Now there were idiots all over Glasgow who actually got that.</p> </blockquote> <p>I recommend <a href=\"https://www.heraldscotland.com/life_style/16103970.clued-up-john-mckie-the-man-behind-the-wee-stinker-crossword/\">this profile</a>, these <a href=\"https://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/18313488.loss-john-mckie-fiendish-crosswords-will-hard-bear/\">responses</a> from <a href=\"https://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/18317060.fond-memories-wee-stinker-t-shirt-badge-honour/\">solvers</a> \u2013 and some of the puzzles can be found in <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Xxl7AAAACAAJ\">the collections of Herald crosswords</a>.</p>",
  "<p>\u2018It always happens when you least expect it.\u201d Or so the adage goes; the romantic notion that the job of your dreams or the love of your life will appear when you\u2019re not trying. In my life, this does not ring true: every job I\u2019ve landed I tried very hard to get, and even in the realm of love there has been work to nurture and maintain it.</p> <p>But when it comes to better mental calm, it did arrive when I least expected it, as an unintended consequence of a tiny tweak: turning notifications off on my phone.</p> <p>I discovered this life-transforming trick while on holiday in Bali. I had already muted notifications related to work (email pings, Slack, Gchat), but still found myself woken up in the middle of the night by the phone vibrating incessantly from conversations happening in the UK across WhatsApp and social media. Next, I switched off all notifications for Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. I also silenced WhatsApp, which \u2013 with all the various group chats \u2013 could easily alert me more than 100 times a day.</p> <p>When I got back to the UK, I saw no reason to put any of these notifications back on, be it work or social. Life was still busy and hectic, but less harsh, somehow. It was as if someone had turned the volume down on my life ever so slightly.</p> <p>I decided to cull even more notices. The news blasts were the first to go: I did not need to be notified hourly about a worsening pandemic that I was helpless to do anything about. Then I disabled the notifications from the dozens of fitness apps that \u201cremind me\u201d (read: chide me) that I have not exercised that day, which I already know. Notifications of store discounts, gone; holiday deals, goodbye. One by one, as a notification popped up on an app, I got rid of it, until just a few crucial ones remained (eg my period tracking app and the one with transport updates about my commute). Rather than my phone buzzing every 20 minutes, it was once every few days.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One of the issues of modern life is our overinflated sense of importance: \u201cWhat if someone needs me urgently?\u201d</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I\u2019d love to say that doing this brought down my overall screen time; that without prompting I did not look at my phone as much. I\u2019d love to say that the evils of the blue screen \u2013 their alleged impact on our sleep and keeping us sedentary \u2013 are now banished from my life, and that instead of hungrily reading articles or watching YouTube videos of Gordon Ramsay being mean to restaurateurs, I flick through history books and go for long walks. But turning off notifications did not give me a personality transplant. My internet-centric behaviours, long programmed inside me, did not wither away.</p> <p>Rather, what it did was stop the feeling of shock associated with being buzzed by the world. A notification, like a telephone call out of the blue, essentially says: \u201cStop everything and look at me right now.\u201d It\u2019s disconcerting; it keeps you in a state of high alert that is stressful and draining, especially when the content may require immediate action. Think of cutting alerts like a digital detox, but less smug, more sustainable and still with access to Google Maps.</p> <p>Stress is the common factor in many behaviours widely understood to be bad for our health \u2013 drinking too much booze, smoking cigarettes, even eating unhealthy food. (There is some evidence to suggest that cortisol \u2013 the hormone released when we feel stress \u2013 makes us crave high fat and sugary foods.) And, these days, many of life\u2019s stressors are communicated via the mobile phone. I cannot stop these stressors, but by turning off notifications, I can at least stop them ambushing me. It\u2019s an action that helps me regain some sense of control. For example, when I open up a news app, I am ready to find out what is happening in the world. It is different from being in the supermarket cheese aisle and getting an alert, where \u2013 as part of a whole barrage of communications \u2013 I may feel blindsided.</p> <p>One of the great issues of modern life is our overinflated sense of importance. We think: \u201cWhat if someone needs me urgently?\u201d However, being \u201cneeded\u201d is quite rare \u2013 wanted, maybe \u2013 but needed as an ordinary person who is not a head of state, health worker or something similar? I\u2019m not so sure. </p> <p>Has anyone even noticed I am slower to respond? Have I had a single comment about being slower to reply, from anyone? The answer is a resounding no.</p> <p>I should mention that this neat little tweak is not a magic bullet. The fact I also do yoga and occasionally see a therapist plays a big part in my increased mental calm. But I felt the difference of doing this instantly, and it felt significant.</p> <p>Turning off notifications is the life-changing tweak that I will never go back from. It\u2019s not a trick anyone can make money from, and so perhaps most people will never hear of it \u2013 although hearing less from the world might be exactly what is needed.</p>",
  "<p>The Prisoners\u2019 Advice Service (PAS), a charity of which I am a trustee, asked the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) last week to <a href=\"http://www.prisonersadvice.org.uk/coronavirus-pas-calls-for-the-release-of-prisoners/\">release groups of prisoners</a> in order to lessen the impact of coronavirus in the penal estate. They have done it in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/iran-to-pardon-10000-including-security-prisoners\">Iran</a>, so why not here?</p> <p>The UK government has already announced that it intends to ease pressure on prisons by increasing the number of prisoners released on home detention curfew with a tag.</p> <p>But the PAS is calling for those inmates who are old or infirm; or have long passed their tariffs \u2013 if they are serving a wretched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/nov/10/ipp-sentencing-regime-in-england-and-wales-branded-deeply-harmful\">imprisonment for public protection</a> (IPP) sentence; or simply do not pose a threat, to be released immediately. These include the more than <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-50082036\">1,700 prisoners</a>, mostly men, aged 70 and over \u2013 some of whom are 80 or older, with a growing number in their 90s.</p> <p>Releasing these prisoners, who are now completely harmless, will undoubtedly save lives, not just of prisoners but also of prison officers and other staff, especially in jails where there are wings full of elderly inmates. We have already had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/first-uk-prisoner-with-covid-19-confirmed-at-strangeways-manchester\">the first case of Covid-19 in a prisoner at Strangeways in Manchester</a>. Make no mistake, this virus will take hold. Nowhere more so than in our antiquated local jails, such as Strangeways, where two or more prisoners are crammed into cells Victorian prison planners designed for one. Please tell us, justice minister, how such inmates can self-isolate?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Local jails may become charnel houses if nothing is done to release those who represent at worst a nuisance to society</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Only last month a <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/report/improving-the-prison-estate/\">report from the National Audit Office </a>on the physical state of prisons revealed a shocking state of disrepair, from leaking roofs and failing heating systems to broken cell windows and rat infestations. So, how can they possibly provide the hygienic conditions needed \u2013 particularly for frail, elderly prisoners \u2013 to fight this virus. Last year inspectors found that 10 out of 35 men\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/first-uk-prisoner-with-covid-19-confirmed-at-strangeways-manchester\">prisons weren\u2019t meeting minimum standards</a> of cleanliness and infection control compliance.</p> <p>When serving time, I experienced a few hairy moments, occasions when I felt my actions would lead to my physical harm. But my biggest fear, always, was suffering a serious illness. Of all the myths peddled by the MoJ, the line that prisoners receive healthcare comparable with that they would receive in the community is the hardest one to swallow.</p> <p>Writing about the state of the prison system in England and Wales, my inbox is full of horror stories of medical neglect in the penal estate. They include prisoners who have died in hospital, more often than not in chains, after prison medical staff had ignored signs of serious illness until it was too late. The one I recount here did not end in death, but the scale of the neglect still shocks me.</p> <p>A prisoner in a Midlands jail complained of severe pains in his leg. He was given paracetamol. Then his leg began to turn black and started to smell. The man did not have great mental capacity and simply accepted his pain. He was discharged from a relatively small sentence and his son immediately took him to their GP, who referred him immediately to a specialist. It was, of course, gangrene and there was nothing to be done but amputate. I put them in touch with a lawyer and the man eventually received compensation. But no treatment, on a leg that had turned black and smelly?</p> <p>Ironically for the hang \u2019em and flog \u2019em brigade, the least dangerous prisons in terms of coronavirus will be the high security ones, which house those who have committed the most serious crimes. They are not overcrowded and all inmates have single cells. The local jails may well transform into charnel houses if nothing is done to release those who represent at worst a nuisance, rather than a danger to society.</p> <p>On Saturday night I spoke to a pal from the old days, who is now retired from the game but keeps abreast of prison matters. He\u2019s a Londoner and we discussed the impact this virus may have on the local jails he and I know well: Pentonville, Wandsworth and Wormwood Scrubs. We discussed our chances of survival if we were back inside any of them. Would we get the medical care our ages (we are now in our 70s) and our underlying medical conditions (I was a heavy smoker) required?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/21/prisons-could-see-800-deaths-from-coronavirus-without-protective-measures\">Prisons \u2018could see 800 deaths\u2019 from coronavirus without protective measures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMore likely to be struck by lightning,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Pentonville, we\u2019d be lucky to get a mattress to sleep on.\u201d</p> <p>As many as 60% of prisoners could become infected with coronavirus, according to Prof Richard Coker at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who has looked at the potential spread of the virus in locked establishments.</p> <p>Those who say criminals deserve what they get should bear in mind that, in life, as in prisons, there is a pecking order.

  "<p>It\u2019s no longer a question of whether we\u2019re going to Mars, but when. By the time we reach a second planet \u2013 probably in the 2030s \u2013 we\u2019ll probably have a base or two on the moon as well. But will people ever live beyond Earth permanently?</p> <p>Hazards abound on the red planet, a world that is colder and drier than Antarctica and without the luxury of breathable air. Andy Weir provides an excellent picture of the struggle to survive in his novel <strong>The Martian</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/dec/09/why-kim-stanley-robinsons-mars-books-will-be-perfect-for-television\" title=\"\">Kim Stanley Robinson</a> takes a deeper dive with his Mars trilogy. The series follows the first 100 settlers, a hand-picked crew of scientists and engineers who gradually transform the climate. There is plenty of engineering and biology, but Robinson broadens into philosophy when he explores how some settlers want to keep Mars pure and red, while others view the life that greens the planet as a gift from humanity. And alternative history is just around the corner when another wave of colonists arrive, dreaming of breaking away from planet Earth.</p> <p>Women may require fewer calories, reducing kilograms and cost for any mission launching from Earth, but governments have proved unwilling to let them take the lead. Martha Ackmann\u2019s <strong>The Mercury 13</strong> tells the story of the women Nasa trained as part of the Mercury programme in the 1960s, and how the US president Lyndon Johnson denied them the opportunity to fly. It wasn\u2019t until 1983 that Sally Ride became the first US female astronaut in space, and the sexist culture at Nasa is the backdrop for <strong>To Space and Back</strong>, a book for younger readers that is as informative as it is aspirational.

Robert Zubrin provides a blueprint for settling the red planet in <strong>The Case for Mars</strong>, laying out how we can get there, establish camps and harvest energy, oxygen and food from the materials we find. He ventures further in <strong>The Case for Space</strong>, where he outlines the opportunities for mining in the asteroid belt and beyond. Gravity on the frigid moons of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune is likely to be too weak to support humans.

Jules Verne\u2019s 1865 adventure story <strong>From the Earth to the Moon</strong> is eerily prescient. More than a century before Apollo 11, Verne imagines a giant cannon built in Florida with great controversy and at great expense, which launches three men in a capsule. They fire retrorockets to land on the moon and eventually return to splash down in the Pacific Ocean. The next few centuries may see us travel to Mars and beyond, but human explorers will find that writers have already planted the flag of the imagination on all these new horizons.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Spacefarers by Christopher Wanjek is published by Harvard.</em></p>",

  "<p>Dionne Warwick is 79 and on fire. In 2019 she released two albums, kicked off a Vegas residency and won a lifetime achievement Grammy award. This year she has already done a turn on the US version of The Masked Singer \u2013 the reality TV show where artists perform songs incognito \u2013 and a UK tour is planned for autumn.</p> <p>As the sweet, mellow voice behind the hits Walk on By and Do You Know the Way to San Jose, she was one of the first artists in the series to be correctly identified by the show\u2019s judging panel. \u201cThe fortunate, or unfortunate thing about my voice is it\u2019s so distinctive,\u201d she says. Obscuring it would have been impossible, she adds. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do that.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s 11am in Las Vegas when Warwick calls me in the UK. At the time she was several months into a run performing four intimate shows a week on Cleopatra\u2019s Barge at Caesars Palace. The shows are currently suspended. After more than five decades of touring, performing like this must feel like a doddle? \u201cEasy for you to say,\u201d she giggles. \u201cIt\u2019s taken the running-through-airports out my life for a minute, but aside from that, it is basically the same.\u201d</p> <p>Warwick has dazzled audiences since the 60s, when she was the bright young thing introduced to the Paris Olympia as \u201cthe black pearl\u201d by Marlene Dietrich. But she had been singing for her supper long before that. Born in 1940 in East Orange, New Jersey, she had a \u201cwonderful\u201d upbringing. \u201cEvery family knew every family, of course,\u201d she says. \u201cMy aunt lived about a block and a half away from us.\u201d Her aunt is Cissy Houston, one of the many singers in the family, and mother of Warwick\u2019s late cousin Whitney Houston.</p> <p>Warwick was singing in the New Hope Baptist Choir in Newark by the age of six. \u201cI come from a gospel-singing family,\u201d she says. Her mother and maternal aunts and uncles toured the country as the Drinkard Singers; she and her sister Dee Dee formed the group the Gospelaires in their teens. Despite this, she insists she didn\u2019t have a showbusiness upbringing. \u201cWe grew up like normal people grow up. Went to school like everybody else did. Did my homework, and did the dishes as I had to. I had a normal life.\u201d</p> <p>She went to college, studying music at Hartt College of Music in Connecticut and was planning to go into teaching. But her music career with the Gospelaires was beginning to take off. \u201cI was doing demonstration records, and backing singing in studios in New York while I was in college,\u201d she says. \u201cFor Dinah Washington, the entire Scepter roster, Chuck Jackson, Maxine Brown, the Shirelles ... we did some things with Ben E King.\u201d</p> <p>Which ones stand out in her memory? \u201cThey all did. Are you kidding me? They were stars. It was really wonderful to be, first of all, in demand, and that\u2019s what our group was. And subsequently, over the years, I made friends with all these people.\u201d She didn\u2019t get to work with Elvis, although, she says: \u201cI had sweet aspirations to. But I had the pleasure of meeting him and getting to know him. That\u2019s as far as that went.\u201d</p> <p>Warwick isn\u2019t inclined to regale me with anecdotes about working in this golden era, preferring to be matter-of-fact about her job. \u201cWe did what we knew how to do,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a very lucrative situation that helped keep me in college with my tuition and books and things of that nature.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5a20d19cba672e6f3200b277ccb0f17d6424ceac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a20d19cba672e6f3200b277ccb0f17d6424ceac/0_0_2283_3000/761.jpg\" alt=\"Warwick with Burt Bacharach in 1968.\" width=\"761\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Warwick with Burt Bacharach in 1968.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Galella/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The music industry had other plans for her. The songwriting duo and kings of easy listening Hal David and Burt Bacharach had heard her work as a session musician and asked her to record a demo of a song that they had written for the Shirelles. They sent it over to Scepter records \u2013 the independent label that launched the careers of the Kingsmen, the Isley Brothers and Tammi Terrell \u2013 and when its president, Florence Greenberg, heard it, says Warwick, paraphrasing Greenberg\u2019s famous response: \u201cShe did not want the song. She wanted the voice, and that was me.\u201d</p> <p>In 1962, she released the Bacharach-David song Don\u2019t Make Me Over, which reached No 21 on the Billboard charts and established her around the world as one of pop music\u2019s great voices. Her biggest hit came in 1967, with I Say A Little Prayer, followed by Do You Know The Way to San Jose in 1968. Despite starting so young, she never had Motown-style deportment coaching for public life, or a chaperone, nor did she need one. \u201cFrom what I was taught at home, I already knew what I was doing and how to act and how to dress and how to speak. I came from a safe, solid home.\u201d</p> <p>Her 60s heyday was relatively short-lived. By 1972, she had split with her prolific writing and producing team; Bacharach and David had decided, mid-recording contract, not to work together any more. \u201cI had no choice but to sue both Bacharach and David,\u201d she says, but their friendship survived. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t cut off and disappear.\u201d This was the start of a patchy decade on the charts, but the 80s brought her another golden era. Her collaboration with the Bee Gees on her album Heartbreaker was a highlight and, in 1985, she teamed up with Elton John, Gladys Knight and Stevie Wonder for a cover version of That\u2019s What Friends Are For.</p> <p>During these years, Warwick spent more and more time in Brazil, and made it her base for \u201cclose to 23 years\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2002/jul/14/features.review27\">She told the Guardian in 2002</a> that she loved it there partly because it shared her values: \u201cFamily and the importance of not being denigrated because you happen to love God. That happens to be high on my priorities, and it seems it is everywhere else except the United States.\u201d Now, she says: \u201cI don\u2019t just feel that way about the US, but I feel that way about the entire world. It\u2019s in the most chaotic state ever. It\u2019s just a period of time in which everything\u2019s changing.</p> <p>\u201cWars, segregation, everything that the entire world is going through, emotionally, mentally and physically, it\u2019s in a sad state right now,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s segregation going on in the States, and segregation going on in the UK. There\u2019s segregation going on everywhere, it\u2019s still the same.\u201d</p> <p>Warwick experienced formal segregation first-hand while touring the southern US, where audiences were split according to race. \u201cIt was in the 60s and it was horrible, something I\u2019d never experienced. It was like a bad movie,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was the modus operandi for that part of our country, unfortunately.\u201d And more than 50 years later, she believes there has been little progress. \u201cNothing\u2019s really changed yet,\u201d she says. \u201cI hope eventually we\u2019ll get to the point where we all understand that we all bleed red blood, end of.\u201d</p> <p>Warwick didn\u2019t get directly involved in the civil rights movement. \u201cI\u2019m not a marcher, I\u2019m a doer,\u201d she says. In 1969, the year after Martin Luther King was assassinated, Warwick won her first Grammy \u2013 best female pop vocal performance for Do You Know the Way to San Jose. \u201cI believe I was the first [African American woman] to win a Grammy in the pop arena, which was basically almost designated for white people,\u201d she says. \u201cSo it was kind of unheard of. I was probably the first person in a lot of areas.\u201d</p> <p>She was also the main breadwinner for her husband, William David Elliott, an actor and drummer, and two sons, David and Damon, who both now work in music (Damon produced one of his mother\u2019s latest albums, She\u2019s Back, and has worked with Beyonc\u00e9, Macy Gray, Britney Spears and Gwen Stefani). That put a strain on the marriage. \u201cI was the major earning power in the family and that is very difficult for the male ego,\u201d she says. \u201cIt just got too much to bear for my husband, and we decided that it would be best for us to part ways.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7b7439d147549e607be305dedf77976ff4ae62f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7b7439d147549e607be305dedf77976ff4ae62f/0_0_3780_2434/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Warwick performing at the Paris Olympia in 1964.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"644\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Warwick performing at the Paris Olympia in 1964.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photo 12/Photo12/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Breadwinning became harder in the 90s. This was when Warwick started presenting infomercials sponsored by the Psychic Friends Network. These took the form of a pastel-hued daytime talkshow, complete with studio audience and a lot of pot plants. Fronted by the psychic Linda Georgian, the network offered a telephone psychic reading service and the infomercials proved a roaring success, raking in $125m a year at its peak.</p> <p>I politely inquire whether this sojourn was a passion or just a job. Warwick is clearly wearied by the fact that she\u2019s never going to live this down, nor the story about her temporarily adding an \u201ce\u201d on the end of her surname in the early 1970s after her astrologer told her it would boost her success, so she plumps for the latter \u2013 just a job \u2013 in a flash. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what it was. It was during a period of time when I was not recording. You know, it kept the lights on in my house and food on my table. It was an earning power. I earned money that I normally would have earned if I was on the road. It\u2019s very simple.\u201d</p> <p>But was she a believer? \u201cNo more than anybody else is,\u201d she says. \u201cYou ask anybody in the world: \u2018What\u2019s your sign?\u2019 and they\u2019ll say it.\u201d I feel bad for having brought it up, so I comment on how successful the show was. \u201cIt sure was,\u201d she says. \u201cThen everybody put a boo-boo on that. They said: \u2018What are you doing, ratting on about that?\u2019 But now that\u2019s all you see on TV or hear people talk about. I\u2019m known to be the first to do things.\u201d</p> <p>In 2011, Warwick appeared on Celebrity Apprentice in the US with Donald Trump. She describes the experience as \u201cvery interesting\u201d. It didn\u2019t go well for her and when her co-contestants turned nasty, she fired herself. \u201cIt got to the point where I felt this was not what I was supposed to be doing with my 50-year career.\u201d However, she says, \u201cthe Donald Trump that I knew was very nice. He really was. He was a gentleman. He never was out of the way with me. I didn\u2019t know what he did with anybody else but I know how he treated me. I did concerts in his hotel, and he was always very nice to me.\u201d</p> <p>She has fewer words to describe how she feels about him now. \u201cI don\u2019t know that man. That\u2019s not the man that I knew. Period.\u201d This is as political as she\u2019s prepared to get. \u201cPolitics, religion and sex are three things that should totally be avoided in conversation,\u201d she says firmly.</p> <p>She\u2019s also, understandably, loth to talk about her cousin Whitney, who died in 2012 after years of substance abuse. As we speak, the bizarre hologram show An Evening With Whitney Houston has opened <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/28/an-evening-with-whitney-houston-hologram-review-liverpool\">in the UK to bewildered reviews</a>. \u201cFirst I even heard about it, so, you know, I have no opinion of it,\u201d she says, but she does. \u201cI think it\u2019s a waste of time.

Confined to our homes with all plans cancelled, borders closed and services stalled, there was little else to distract us from an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/22/the-coronavirus-story-is-unfathomably-large-we-must-get-the-reporting-right\">unfathomable crisis</a> that was getting more dystopic by the day.</p> <p>But for those who tuned in to Isolaid this weekend \u2013 a two day Australian music festival which ran via Instagram\u2019s live story feature \u2013 there was solace to be found. We were all there in the same place, going through the same thing, despite being alone. I didn\u2019t expect to be so caught up in it. I didn\u2019t expect to feel such relief.</p> <p>Organised by Emily Ulman, Rhiannon Atkinson-Howatt (Merpire) and Shannen Egan to raise funds and awareness for industry non-profit Support Act, Isolaid featured 74 acts playing 20-minute sets, livestreaming from their bedrooms, their home farms, the bedraggled living rooms of their inner-city share houses. After each set, the performer would throw to the next \u2013 and we would scrabble for the right account to tune into.</p> <p>Most artists pulled a crowd of around 4-600, including a bunch of other musicians, managers, label folk and promoters who were lighting up the comments with love hearts and applause emojis. The live performance industry was one of the first to be decimated by coronavirus: according to the user-generated data compiled by <a href=\"https://ilostmygig.net.au/\">I Lost My Gig</a>, cancelled gigs have cost them more than $280m already.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/21/coronavirus-leaves-roadies-and-events-crew-devastated-its-the-first-industry-to-stop-dead\">Coronavirus leaves roadies and events crew devastated: 'It's the first industry to stop dead'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps that\u2019s why Isolaid felt like the first laugh after a big cry. The energy was fun, hilarious and occasionally chaotic. Musicians stopped songs to read the comments, and brought dogs in to distract us while they tuned. Denise Le Menice gave a brilliant set from WA, filling in for Moaning Lisa who had to cancel last-minute. \u201cThanks for clapping \u2013 not that I can hear!\u201d she laughed manically, before trying to auction off a signed roll of toilet paper for $20, drink in hand. \u201cCheers to the coronavirus, you little fucking dickhead!\u201d</p> <p>Just like at every other music festival, I ran into friends, discovered a bunch of new bands, saved the schedule as my screen lock and got FOMO each time I had to miss a set. Unlike every other music festival, I was wearing pyjamas and eating from crockery. I propped my screen up on the kitchen counter to watch a few sets as I cooked a salmon steak. Each performance was ephemeral, one-time-only; Instagram stories delete themselves after 24 hours. \u201cTake care of each other,\u201d musicians told us, over and over again. \u201cStay home. Stay away from people. Stay sane.\u201d</p> <p>And they were there for each other too. \u201cI\u2019m so nervous,\u201d said Eilish Gilligan, before premiering a yet-to-be-recorded song written with Japanese Wallpaper and Alex Lahey.</p> <p>\u201cOMG YES EILISH,\u201d wrote Lahey in the comments. \u201c10/10,\u201d commented Ball Park Music. \u201cWe stan Eilish more than anything else in this whole world,\u201d said Cry Club.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the most connected I have felt in many, many days,\u201d McMahon told us from her living room.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43f98da7f78cfa8c385afc032de8f0c2c048028f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43f98da7f78cfa8c385afc032de8f0c2c048028f/0_561_828_630/500.jpg\" alt=\"Hannah Blackburn invited her band in through the window.\" width=\"500\" height=\"380\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hannah Blackburn invited her band in through the window.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Each \u201cstage\u201d was set differently.

Zoe Fox\u2019s hysterical set, filmed by Melbourne artist Didirri, featured costumed extras and Instagram filters that turned her into a surprise pickle. It ended with a cross to the next artist, Ro, who performed from the next room \u2013 before another cross to Didirri\u2019s set. His cover of Times They Are a Changin\u2019 was both impossibly hokey and weirdly perfect. This share house was having the best time.</p> <p>Liv Cartledge, Clews and June Jones gave us lo-fi sets with stunning vocals; Lupa J and Harvey Sutherland made big parties in home studios; Rat Hammock and Good Morning had full bands, sensibly spaced out. Housemates applauded in the background. There were a great many dogs. Emma Russack\u2019s mum played piano behind her, and Cry Club offered a stripped back version of their social distance anthem: Don\u2019t Fucking Touch Me.</p> <p>On Sunday night Julia Jacklin sang the most prescient lines of the weekend: \u201cYou\u2019ll go outside, enjoy the sun / soon you\u2019ll feel fine to see everyone\u201d (Comfort); \u201cYou can love somebody without using your hands\u201d (Head Alone); and, \u201cI know I\u2019ve locked myself in my room / I\u2019ll open up the door and try to love again soon\u201d (Pressure to Party). Her set was watched by more than 2,700.</p> <p>Around the same number had tuned into Stella Donnelly the night before. Donnelly is staying with her partner and his dad and dog, away from her own family in Western Australia, whose borders have just closed. \u201cMy mum\u2019s still a punk, and you\u2019re still shit,\u201d she drawled in a verse from Seasons Greeting \u2013 before breaking from the song to speak directly to the camera: \u201cMiss you, Mum.\u201d</p> <p>According to the organisers, the festival raised $12,000 for Support Act \u2013 and they\u2019re booking a follow-up for next weekend already. As musicians keep searching for a way to make money from performing for us online, initiatives like this could help the industry in other ways \u2013 and give the rest of us what we need too: music, joy and company in an isolated time.</p>",

They\u2019re out there looking for trouble.

He says there\u2019s also reluctance to crack down and alienate them for fear they will leave and set up their own gangs.</p> <p>Efforts by police to bring the two gangs together have so far been unsuccessful, as both gangs say they are not yet ready to meet face to face to discuss a truce.</p> <p>In the meantime, local police are taking a hard line.

They\u2019re always fighting amongst themselves,\u201d says an elderly lady. \u201cI\u2019ve got grandkids in both gangs.

But now I\u2019m second-guessing their intentions.\u201d</p> <p>Scooping up her son and heading home she says: \u201cIf they\u2019re going to fight at a park or a shopping centre \u2026 who knows where it will end.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump attempted to blunt growing criticism of the stalled federal response to the coronavirus crisis on Sunday night, promising that more help was on the way for states suffering a critical shortage of medical equipment, hospital beds and testing facilities.</p> <p>As the death toll from Covid-19 in the US<a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\"> rose to 417</a>, with more than 33,000 cases reported nationwide, increasing numbers of state and city leaders fired off warnings to the White House that a tipping point was near.</p> <p>Warnings were particularly strong from New York, where cases have risen sharply past 15,000 and now account for around half of those in the US.</p> <p>Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York city, said earlier in the day hospital supplies including ventilators, masks and surgical gloves would be exhausted within 10 days, while Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York state, warned that up to 80% of his state\u2019s population of almost 20 million was at risk of contracting the virus.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like we\u2019re on our own,\u201d De Blasio said on CNN. \u201cWe have seen next to nothing from the federal government at this point.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s response came at an evening press conference at the White House, during which he acknowledged \u201ca back-up\u201d in some states and reeled off numbers and lists of equipment he said had been ordered for the three worst-hit states, New York, Washington and California, and others.</p> <p>He also said the US government would be funding \u201c100%\u201d of the costs of national guard deployment to assist in the supply chain, said he had approved major disaster declarations for New York and Washington states and that the army corps of engineers would be available for the construction of field hospitals providing thousands of new beds.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever the states can get, they should be getting,\u201d the president said.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s sort of a back-up for the states, and some of the states are doing really well and some don\u2019t do as well. The ones that don\u2019t do as well need more help. But these are three states that really do need help because they are hit really hard.\u201d</p> <p>Cuomo had urged the president to invoke the powers of the Defense Production Act for the<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/22/politics/andrew-cuomo-coronavirus-federal-government/index.html\"> government to assume the acquisition and distribution of medical supplies</a> and prevent states having to compete with each other for essential equipment. He said masks that would usually cost 85 cents were costing his state, where more than 15,000 have the virus and 117 have died, about $7 apiece.</p> <p>But Trump insisted that private companies stepping up to manufacture much-needed equipment was the way to go. \u201cDoing it the way we\u2019re doing it is much better,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the threat of doing it if we need it but we have millions of masks being done, ventilators, respirators, we have a lot of good things happening right now.</p> <p>\u201cCompanies are calling us, General Motors spoke to us about doing ventilators. If I call companies and say, \u2018you build us ventilators,\u2019 they don\u2019t even know what a ventilator is.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also suggested that hospitals could sterilize face masks so they could be reused.</p> <h2>Dems block rescue bill over lack of worker aid</h2> <p>Meanwhile, in the US Senate, Democrats blocked legislation that would have pumped $1tn into the US economy, claiming the Republican-crafted bill favored corporate interests over hospitals, healthcare workers, cities and states. Earlier, the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, was touting the stimulus that would have put $3,000 into the hands of most American families.</p> <p>The failure forces the two parties back to the negotiating table on Monday. Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, said Democrats might craft their own legislation proposals. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work with everybody to see if we can get something done,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have to help the American worker.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-rand-paul-senator-tests-positive-covid-19\">Rand Paul becomes first senator to test positive for Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A number of US senators were weighing up a decision to self-quarantine after news emerged that the Kentucky Republican <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-rand-paul-senator-tests-positive-covid-19\">Rand Paul had tested positive</a> for Covid-19.

In a televised address - his third in less than a week - Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the measure will prohibit \u201cthe circulation and movement of citizens\u201d deemed to be \u201cpurposeless\u201d - the strictest restriction, yet, in the fight to contain the novel coronavirus spreading further. </p> <p>\u201cIt is perhaps the last step that an organised democratic state [can take],\u201d he said. \u201c A step which must be taken in time, so that it is not taken in vain, because time isn\u2019t counted, any more, in days but in hours,\u201d he told the nation adding that in Italy, every two minutes, a life was now being lost to Covid-19. </p> <p>Exceptions to the rule would be made for citizens going to and from work; for the provision of food and medicine; for visits to a doctor and for those who needed care; for those exercising individually, or with one other person, and for people walking dogs. Those travelling to their permanent place of residence would also be exempt from the measure. </p> <p>But once enforced anyone out on the streets would have to have their passports or identity cards with them at all times, the centre right leader said insisting that the full force of the law would be imposed on those who violated the restriction. Fines of 150 euro will be given in the case of infractions. </p> <p>Although Greece has managed to contain the spread of Covid-19 infections, numbers are going up and privately officials say they expect a big leap in the coming days. On Sunday, health authorities announced that in the past 24 hours there had been 94 new cases of people testing positive for the virus with a total of 624 confirmed coronavirus cases countrywide. To date, 15 people have died from the disease (with the exception of three, all men). Altogether 124 have been hospitalised with 34 requiring intensive care - double the figure over that released yesterday. Most of those who have contracted the virus are in Athens. The average age of those hospitalised is 64. <br><br>Greece was among the first EU member states to announce draconian measures to stem the virus, starting with the closure of schools on March 10, followed by the shutting of nightclubs, gyms, cinemas and theatres two days later and cafes, restaurants, bars and shopping malls on March 13. All retail shops were ordered closed on March 18. In his address, Mitsotakis thanked the vast majority of Greeks for upholding the restrictions, chastising the \u201cfrivolous few [who] undermine the safety of most.\u201d </p> <p>Greeks could be seen in droves converging on beaches on Saturday to enjoy the warm weather. A mass exodus of residents from Athens and other urban centres to villages in the countryside has also alarmed authorities who fear transmission rates spreading to remote areas nationwide. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T17:58:13.354Z\">at 5.58pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e779cd58f08a08573fbf623\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T17:15:03.890Z\">5.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Our UK focussed coronavirus blog is reporting on Boris Johnson\u2019s daily press conference which is currently happening.

Speaking on the occasion of the New Year and Eid al-Mab\u2019ath, the 80-year-old said \u201cyou Americans are accused of engineering coronavirus\u201d, adding: \u201cI do not know how true this claim is, but as long as the accusation stands, which sensible person would trust you to accept your offer of help.</p> <p>\u201cPossibly your (offered) medicine is a way to spread the virus more,\u201d he said. \u201cOr if you send therapists and doctors, maybe so they want to see the effect of the poison in Iranian society, so they can complete their information. It is said that part of the virus was produced against the Iranian people.\u201d</p> <p>His tone contradicted that of the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, who had the day before sent a heartfelt plea to the American public to set aside their differences with Iran and work together to fight the virus, including by the US suspending economic sanctions on Iran.</p> <p>The supreme leader was immediately challenged by Iranian reformist politicians such as Mahmoud Sadeghi to produce evidence to back his claim.</p> <p>Khamenei\u2019s controversial belief in an American biological conspiracy came as the Iranian health ministry said the new infections in Iran in the past 24 hours had reached 1,865, with a further 129 deaths. The official figures show the number of deaths by day stabilising.</p> <p>The total number of infected people had reached 21,638. The health ministry spokesman said 7,913 people had recovered.</p> <p>The official figures have been widely challenged on the basis that the recording of the number of deaths includes only those who died after being tested for the disease. The World Health Organization has said the figure may be only a fifth of the true number who have died. The official death toll shows no obvious pattern since for the last three days it has risen only from 220 to 240, yet the infections are rising.</p> <p>Iran also continued to send out contradictory messages about whether it could overcome the virus without sanctions being lifted. The letter from the president underlined the need for US sanctions being lifted. Khamenei has insisted the country can survive independently.</p> <p>The US state department hit back at claims it was preventing medicines reaching Iran, saying: \u201cDear Iranians, as your government will not tell you the truth, we say: on March 2, Iran, which instead of acting like any normal government around the world, refuses to make your economic system transparent. The reason the regime is hiding its economy is because it is corrupt.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In Tehran province the deputy mayor, Hamid Reza Goudarzi, after weeks of controversy has announced that all shops but essential food shops and pharmacies must close, and those that refuse to abide by the instructions will be punished.</p> <p>The International Monetary Fund has still not responded to an Iranian request for a $5bn loan to help fight the virus.</p> <p>Qom News, an agency covering Qom, one of the centres of the disease, reported on Sunday: \u201cIn every house black cloth hangs from the walls of houses and the sound of crying in mourning houses resounds.

If Southwell were chosen, for example, it could take 110 horses in its stables and benefit from another 35 potential runners at Scott Dixon\u2019s base within walking distance. That would avoid the need for runners to be driven long distances to the track from training centres around the country and so there would be no breach of the government\u2019s advice against unnecessary travel.</p> \n<p>Dixon has made arrangements to keep his stable functioning and his horses cared for during the crisis. \u201cWe\u2019ve got six staff living on the site now,\u201d the trainer said on Sunday, \u201cand strict procedures are in place, trying to keep everyone healthy. We\u2019re doing a group shop for everybody to reduce the need for anyone to go out and obviously we keep doling out the hand sanitiser.\u201d<br><br>Meanwhile, Saturday\u2019s Dubai World Cup has become the latest sporting event to be lost due to the coronavirus pandemic, organisers having accepted on Sunday that the sensationally valuable night\u2019s racing could not be staged. The event, with a total prize fund of around \u00a330m, had been due to be held behind closed doors at Meydan and was scheduled to be part of a packed 11-race broadcast on ITV4.<br><br>Only one day earlier, officials were insisting World Cup night would go ahead, despite other sporting fixtures in the UAE having been suspended on Thursday. But a statement was issued at lunchtime on Sunday, saying: \u201cTo safeguard the health of all participants, the higher organising committee of the Dubai World Cup 2020 has decided to postpone 25th edition of the global tournament to next year.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"45916529-e7f8-4856-856a-b082661a24b5\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Naas</b><br><b>2.00</b> Poetic Flare <b>2.30</b> Knight Of Malta <b>3.00</b> Dark Vader <b>3.30</b> Elusive King <b>4.00</b> Sir Dragonet <b>4.30</b> Even So (nb) <b>5.00</b> Russian Emperor (nap)</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Benbatl, a winner at Newmarket last autumn, had been the 2-1 favourite for the World Cup, in which he was expected to clash with the US-based Pegasus World Cup winner, Mucho Gusto. Those lined up for other valuable races on the card included the Melbourne Cup winner, Cross Counter. Most of the visiting runners were reported to have arrived in Dubai by the end of last week.</p> \n<h2>Monday\u2019s best bets</h2> \n<p>What fun, in our reduced circumstances, to be allowed to play a round of that great springtime game, How Far Forward Is Aidan O\u2019Brien? The dominant Flat trainer quite often makes a steady start to the year, while continuing to win some prizes by sheer weight of ammunition, so how will it be today when Flat racing on turf returns at Naas?</p> \n<p>The opener is a two-year-old maiden in which, of course, O\u2019Brien has the favourite. But, as the Racing Post points out, he hasn\u2019t won this race since 2004 and the breeding of his runner today, Lipizzaner, does not suggest a penchant for soft ground. <strong>Poetic Flare (2.00)</strong>, from the Jim Bolger yard that has often done well on opening day, is down to 5-2, which is just about OK.</p> \n<p>O\u2019Brien may have more luck through<strong> Sir Dragonet (4.00)</strong> and <strong>Russian Emperor (5.00)</strong>. This ought to be a big year for Sir Dragonet, who memorably hosed up in the Chester Vase, showing an aptitude for this kind of ground, and was beaten less than a length in the Derby. He even ran well on quick ground in the Leger. Odds of 8-13 don\u2019t thrill, given that we can\u2019t be sure how ready he is, but the unexposed Brogue requires more of a leap of faith.</p> \n<p>Russian Emperor is 6-5 for the maiden at the end of the card. He was an eye-catcher on his only start so far, when third to a more fancied stablemate in July, and could take a major step forward here.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewNJHawkins/status/1152577086927724545\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Check out Atlantic Jewel's son Russian Emperor finishing third on debut in a 2yo maiden over 1400m at the Curragh tonight.

The Public Interest Law Centre, Project 17, Migrants\u2019 Rights Network and others have produced an open letter to councils calling on them to establish Covid-19 homeless task forces for this group catering for such people.</p> <p>It is unclear whether an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/uk-hotels-homeless-shelters-coronavirus\">initiative</a> due to be announced on Monday to house homeless people in empty hotels will include destitute migrants or only British street homeless people.
