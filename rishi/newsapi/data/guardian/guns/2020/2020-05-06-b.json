However, with 84% of today\u2019s 1,032 new cases and 67% of the national total located in the capital, the health minister <strong>Jaime Ma\u00f1alich</strong> has taken to referring ominously to the situation as the \u201cbattle for Santiago\u201d.</p> \n  <p>According to official statistics released by the health ministry, Chile had largely kept its epidemic under control. However, the country now has 23,048 confirmed cases and 281 people have died having tested positive.</p> \n  <p>Chile has maintained the highest level of testing in Latin America with more than 230,000 tests carried out. And the government has suggested an increase in testing could have contributed to the recent uptick in cases.</p> \n  <p>But the pandemic has also pushed out of the wealthier western suburbs of Santiago into more deprived, poorer-equipped areas of the capital. And the government has announced that 12 more districts will go into quarantine from Friday as part of its \u201cdynamic\u201d approach to enforcing and lifting lockdowns.</p> \n  <p>Checkpoints will also be set up around the nearby coastal cities of Vi\u00f1a del Mar and Valpara\u00edso \u2013 the country\u2019s second-largest population centre \u2013 where cases are currently far lower than in the capital.</p> \n  <p>Amid the rise in cases, the government has also softened its rhetoric with regard to a passport-style scheme that it had said would certify \u201cimmunity\u201d. A WHO directive has since urged caution regarding such policies.</p> \n  <p>Nonetheless, the government has said the first cards will be issued on Friday, although they will simply confirm that a person has tested positive for the virus, not that they are immune.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T18:49:32.198Z\">at 7.49pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb3011f8f08597eeb1b7403\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T18:42:03.149Z\">7.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Iceland has all but eliminated the virus as 97% of infected patients have recovered and only two new cases have been confirmed in the last week, the country\u2019s chief epidemiologist <strong>Thorolfur Gudnason</strong> has said.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have been pleasantly surprised to see a very fast deceleration of the pandemic in Iceland.

That suggests that the virus was already being transmitted extensively around the globe from early on in the epidemic. </p> \n  <p>Balloux said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>All viruses naturally mutate. Mutations in themselves are not a bad thing and there is nothing to suggest SARS-CoV-2 is mutating faster or slower than expected.</p> \n   <p>So far we cannot say whether SARS-CoV-2 is becoming more or less lethal and contagious.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Balloux said the 198 small genetic changes, or mutations, that the study identified appeared to have independently occurred more than once. </p> \n  <p>These may hold clues to how the virus is adapting and help in efforts to develop drugs and vaccines. Ballouz explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A major challenge to defeating viruses is that a vaccine or drug might no longer be effective if the virus has mutated. </p> \n   <p>If we focus our efforts on parts of the virus that are less likely to mutate, we have a better chance of developing drugs that will be effective in the long run.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The UCL team\u2019s findings, published on Wednesday in the journal Infection, Genetics and Evolution, confirm that the virus emerged in late 2019, Balloux said, before quickly spreading across the globe. </p> \n  <p>The study was not able to confirm the exact starting point or location. </p> \n  <p>A study by <strong>French scientists</strong> published earlier this week found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/french-hospital-discovers-covid-19-case-december-retested\">a man there was infected with Covid-19 as early as 27 December</a>, nearly a month before France confirmed its first cases. <br></p> \n  <p> The <strong>World Health Organization</strong> said the French case was \u201cnot surprising\u201d and urged countries to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/who-seeks-early-coronavirus-cases-as-merkel-warns-over-german-lockdown\">investigate any other early suspicious cases</a>. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb2913a8f084fb5ab57d176\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T10:33:23.726Z\">11.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Twitter</strong> said it would tackle the spread of damaging conspiracy theories linking mobile phone technology and coronavirus with a prompt to direct people searching for 5G to British government-verified information. </p> \n  <p>The theory, which has spread on social media, has resulted in attacks on mobile telecoms masts and abuse directed at engineers in <strong>Britain</strong>. </p> \n  <p>Scientists, phone companies and the government have said it is completely untrue. </p> \n  <p>Twitter said the search prompt would inform users that the government had seen no link between 5G and Covid-19, and include a link to a government website with credible, factual and verified information in relation to 5G. </p> \n  <p>Katy Minshall, Twitter UK\u2019s head of government, public policy and philanthropy, said the move was the latest step in its focus on connecting people with authoritative information regarding Covid-19. </p> \n  <p>\u201cOur partnerships throughout this pandemic have allowed us to take proactive steps in bringing people the information most relevant and useful for them,\u201d she said. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e555962df387d1ecb97d8a5465f2d04a1df7d65c\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e555962df387d1ecb97d8a5465f2d04a1df7d65c/0_0_5568_3340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A burned down mobile phone mast in London.

Vialli then rounded Zenga nervelessly before ramming the ball into the net with appreciable glee. Vialli celebrates with a clumsy somersault, and looks <em>absolutely shattered </em>as he is embraced by his teammates. Zenga charges after the linesman, appealing furiously for offside/a foul on Ferri/ANYTHING YOU BALD TIT!

This match has been circled on the wallchart for months: Internazionale v Sampdoria at the San Siro, the Serie A title decider. AC Milan may have something to say about that, but the strong likelihood is that we will be watching the champions today. The equation is deliciously simple: Inter <em>have</em> to win, Sampdoria only need a draw to maintain control. And if they steal both points at the San Siro, they will all but clinch their first ever <em>scudetto</em>.</p> <p>Serie A doesn\u2019t generally do feelgood stories. This is serious, hard-nosed business, conducted and consumed with a fervour that makes religion seem almost frivolous by comparison. Sampdoria have been dreaming of the title since Paolo Mantovani bought the club 12 years ago. But the more you want something, the scarier it becomes. If they are beaten today, Sampdoria will be only one point clear - and they\u2019ll have Inter\u2019s volcanic breath all over their neck.</p> <p>This is the league table with four games to play:</p> <ul> <li>Sampdoria 45 pts</li> <li>Inter 42</li> <li>Milan 41</li> <li>Genoa, Juventus, Parma, Torino 34</li> </ul> <p>Sampdoria\u2019s ability to cope with a cacophonous San Siro will go a long way to deciding today\u2019s match. They were excellent in the tough away games earlier in the season \u2013 they won here against Milan, drew at Juventus and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Bw_7SDzECI\">walloped the champions Napoli in that surreal game in November</a>. But those games took place in the first half of the season, in more innocent times. We\u2019re at the business end of the season now, and there aren\u2019t many tomorrows.</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>4pm CET on 5 May 1991, 7.45pm BST on 6 May 2020.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T18:27:18.660Z\">at 7.27pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

Three tweeters provide high notes, while the bar can be wall or table-top mounted, adjusting automatically for the best sound.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4c786856f1f8eb7eb6afd766f201f7b71f7c3c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4c786856f1f8eb7eb6afd766f201f7b71f7c3c0/1228_312_7680_4608/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sonos Arc\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Sonos Arc\u2019s mesh hides a large array of speakers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sonos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Arc builds on the success of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/27/sonos-beam-review-a-great-compact-jack-of-all-trades-upgrade-for-your-tv\">Sonos\u2019s cheaper Beam soundbar</a>, being one of the few manufacturers integrating both Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google\u2019s Assistant for optional voice control. It also has Sonos\u2019s speech enhancement system for clarifying dialogue in TV and movies, and its night sound system, which tempers loud effects for quieter listening, a feature popular with people who live in close proximity to others.</p> <p>The soundbar connects to the TV via HDMI, supporting the <a href=\"https://www.hdmi.org/spec21Sub/EnhancedAudioReturnChannel\">new eARC standard</a> required for Dolby Atmos, but is backward-compatible with the previous ARC and optical audio connections. As with Sonos\u2019s other products, Arc can also be combined with the firm\u2019s wireless sub and a pair of rear speakers.</p> <p>Arc is one of the firm\u2019s first speakers to launch on its new S2 software, which supports higher-resolution audio and other more advanced features. It connects to wifi and can stream music from a vast array of services including the new, free Sonos radio, Spotify, Apple Music and others, while also supporting Apple\u2019s AirPlay 2 and Spotify Connect. S2 will launch with a new and improved app for controlling the system, including the user-requested feature of saved multi-room groups.</p> <p>Arc will cost \u00a3799 in the UK and $799 in the US (A$1,399 in Australia), shipping from 10 June, available in white or black.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67e1d37e53ddcd7456baa0c1fc23b1f0c616c8e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67e1d37e53ddcd7456baa0c1fc23b1f0c616c8e9/3308_3183_10748_6452/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sonos 5 and Sub (gen 3)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Sonos 5 and Sub (gen 3) join the updated line, revamped for technology but preserving their much-loved sound.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sonos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alongside the Arc soundbar, Sonos is also launching revamped versions of its wireless Sub and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/29/sonos-play5-review-wireless-wifi-speaker-multiroom-music\">Play:5 speakers</a>, now simply known as Sonos 5, which match the previous versions on sound but have improved wifi, memory and processing power used to support more advanced features down the road. The Sub (gen 3) and Sonos 5 will be available on 10 June for \u00a3699/$699/A$999 and \u00a3499/$499/A$749 respectively.</p> <p>Sonos has been embroiled in several controversies over recent months, first by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/07/technology/sonos-sues-google.html\">suing Google over patents, among other complaints</a> associated with voice technologies, and has accused Amazon of doing something similar. Sonos, which has 10 million customers using 29m of its products, is being seen as a bellwether for smaller companies standing up to being squeezed by the big US technology firms.</p> <p>The company also faced complaints from users over its plans to stop supporting speakers over five years old as part of its shift to the S2 platform. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/24/sonos-apologises-over-plan-affecting-older-smart-speakers\">Sonos later clarified</a> that its \u201clegacy\u201d speakers would continue to work as they do now, but would have to be isolated from other speakers upgraded to the S2 platform. Sonos previously won praise for its unusually long software support life.</p>",

Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon.\u201d</p> <p>A strong <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">economy</a> has long been Trump\u2019s central argument for re-election, but stay-at-home orders during the pandemic have wreaked havoc and wiped out at least 30m jobs. Trump regards recovery as politically vital as a series of opinion polls show him trailing election opponent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a>.</p> <p>Undeterred by a coronavirus death toll already bigger than the US\u2019s in the Vietnam war, Trump has urged supporters to \u201cliberate\u201d states from pandemic restrictions and cheered on state governors who order reopenings in defiance of his own phased federal guidelines. Commentators suspect his strategy will be to claim credit for economic gains while shifting blame to governors for resurgences of the virus.</p> <p>Infection rates continue to increase outside New York, the hardest-hit state. On Monday, researchers at the University of Washington\u2019s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation almost doubled its previous US mortality model to more than 134,000. And a leaked internal White House report suggests that the daily US death toll will climb to 3,000 a day by June.</p> <p>The administration has also restricted coronavirus taskforce members from testifying before Congress unless they have \u201cexpress approval\u201d.

  "<p>Leader of the opposition has always been one of the toughest jobs in politics and Keir Starmer has come to it in exceptionally tricky circumstances. His party has been out of government for a decade. Labour is united in wanting to set factional differences aside but without agreement on how to do it.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Boris Johnson is enjoying a prolonged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/28/happiness-increasing-boris-johnson-coronavirus\" title=\"\">honeymoon in opinion polls</a>. Partly that reflects natural gravitation of support to incumbents in a national crisis. Mr Johnson\u2019s critics might complain that his credentials as a reliable leader are unearned, but the complaint itself is unlikely to change voters\u2019 minds.</p> <p>Sir Keir\u2019s challenge is to assert the truth about government failings without appearing to undermine its pandemic response with excessive partisanship. That is the balance he struck in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/06/pmqs-verdict-floundering-johnson-meets-calm-and-focused-starmer\" title=\"\">first interrogation of Mr Johnson in parliament</a> on Wednesday. The questions were well calibrated to dismantle Downing Street\u2019s claim that the UK\u2019s handling of the coronavirus has been a success. It has not, as the grim death toll \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-above-32000-to-highest-in-europe\" title=\"\">the highest in Europe</a> \u2013 seems to indicate. Sir Keir\u2019s background as a barrister equips him well to build a case and present it in a way that discomforts the other side. Mr Johnson\u2019s typically blustering responses sounded doubly vacuous in a Commons hushed by the requirements of physical distancing.</p> <p>It is not surprising that the prime minister prefers to make announcements by televised address, and the Labour leader is right to demand that future policy changes be presented to parliament first. Mr Johnson is in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/24/johnson-avoiding-scrutiny-cancelled-appearances-says-senior-mp\" title=\"\">habit of evading such scrutiny</a> and is unlikely to relish routine questioning from a rigorous adversary. But competence across the despatch box is only a small part of the project to persuade voters that the leader of the opposition is a potential prime minister. Most of that task is behind closed doors. It is the strategic mission to develop a clear argument about what is wrong with the country and a distinctive prescription for making it better.</p> <p>The vital ingredient is optimism. Oppositions win elections when people gamble on change. It is not sufficient to convince voters that the incumbent has flaws. By extension, sitting governments cannot expect public gratitude for their achievements when oppositions have a more compelling account of what should come next. The Tory party is haunted by its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/26/guardian190-labour-victory-1945\" title=\"\">defeat in 1945</a>, when national rejoicing at victory in the second world war failed to translate into votes for Winston Churchill.</p> <p>Military analogies are overused in the current crisis, but that postwar poll is not an unrealistic model for Labour. The job of reconstruction required after the pandemic will be as vast. That task should have a clear ethical blueprint, incorporating longer-standing social and economic challenges, just as the establishment of the NHS in the 1940s spoke to legacy demands of the pre-war years. Labour has an opportunity to develop the equivalent vision for the 2020s, for example, by combining changes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/06/uks-coronavirus-recovery-should-have-green-focus-johnson-urged\" title=\"\">demanded by the climate emergency</a> with reforms to achieve a more equitable distribution of wealth and opportunity.</p> <p>That is a heavy intellectual burden when the party also has an electoral mountain to climb, but the summit will not be reached with smaller-scale ambition. A trap for Sir Keir is to think he can advance by tactical increments, probing weaknesses in Mr Johnson\u2019s position, chipping away at the Tories\u2019 lead. Politics affords few second chances and the Labour leader\u2019s audition with the electorate has begun already. There are many more questions than answers about his priorities, and his vision. It is still very early in the electoral cycle. No one expects to see a fully-formed government-in-waiting yet. But there will come a time when voters demand to know what the opposition stands for, besides criticising the Tories. If Labour is to build something worth showing at that moment, the foundations need laying now.</p>",

Also today, Nicola Sturgeon told Holyrood her government would start to lift restrictions \u201cas soon as possible\u201d, after the latest data showed coronavirus-related deaths in Scotland fell for the first time, and the Welsh government said it expected a \u201ccareful and cautious approach\u201d to relaxing the lockdown from Westminster.<strong> <br></strong></li> \n   <li><strong>Rishi Sunak is preparing to wind down the job retention scheme from July as the government plans to gradually remove lockdown measures.</strong> A decision is yet to be made, but the Treasury is understood to be examining several options for tapering the scheme, including cutting the 80% wage subsidy to 60% and lowering the \u00a32,500 cap on monthly payments. Another option promoted by employers\u2019 groups to allow furloughed staff to work, but with a smaller state subsidy, is also under consideration.</li> \n   <li><strong>The official UK coronavirus death toll passed 30,000 as another 649 fatalities were recorded.</strong> The new total of 30,076 represents the number of people who have tested positive for Covid-19 and died, so the true number will be much higher.</li> \n   <li><strong>Heathrow airport is to begin temperature screening of passengers in an effort to minimise transmission across borders.</strong> The airport\u2019s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said it would trial technologies and processes that could form the basis of a common international standard for health screening at airports, including cameras in immigration halls.</li> \n   <li><strong>No 10 scaled down the scope of the PM\u2019s new \u201c200,000 tests per day\u201d target as the government missed its 100,000 daily tests goal for a fourth day running.</strong> The PM\u2019s spokesman said that when Johnson set the new testing target for the end of May during PMQs, he had been referring to testing capacity. Later, Robert Jenrick told the daily press briefing that 69,463 tests were carried out yesterday.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Rising levels of racism towards people of east Asian heritage have left many feeling too scared to venture out when the lockdown is eventually lifted, research suggests. </strong>The survey by Prof Binna Kandola found that just over half of respondents had experienced an increase in discrimination since the pandemic began, with Chinese people reporting being coughed at, attacked, mocked and abused. Kandola said society had an opportunity to show zero tolerance towards racist behaviour once the lockdown is eased.</li> \n   <li><strong>The tube will only be able to run at 20% capacity to allow for physical distancing, Sadiq Khan said.</strong> The mayor of London said the transport system could not operate at pre-crisis levels while maintaining physical distancing at all times, so capacity would have to be reduced to 13-20% and the carrying capacity of double-decker buses could be reduced from 85 to 15 passengers. He argued that everyone in London who could work from home would have to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. </li> \n   <li><strong>And police decided not to take action against Prof Neil Ferguson after he breached lockdown rules.</strong> The scientist resigned last night after it emerged that he had broken lockdown restrictions by receiving visits from his lover. This morning the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said it was right that he had stepped down and backed any action the police decided to take. However, Scotland Yard said that since Ferguson had accepted responsibility for his error of judgment, no further action would be taken. Downing Street confirmed Ferguson would no longer be advising the government in any way.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s it from us on the UK side for today.

Combining this data with information with data about when people developed symptoms, and modelling showing how the virus would have spread, the team estimated that 72% of people on the ship infected with the virus remained asymptomatic.</p> \n  <p>The research has not been peer-reviewed, but there is a preliminary outline <a href=\"https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/asymp-transmission.html\">here</a>, and a press release <a href=\"https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2020/almost-75-people-board-diamond-princess-covid-19-may-have-been-asymptomatic\">here</a>. Here\u2019s an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The research team estimated that 72% of people infected with Covid-19 onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship remained asymptomatic. For each asymptomatic case, it remained uncertain how infectious they were although they were unlikely to be as infectious as a symptomatic case.</p> \n   <p>Overall, the team estimate that asymptomatic cases were responsible for 11-84% of all infections during the outbreak. Work will be extended with more data (where available) and to other outbreaks, which the team hopes will enable more accurate estimates of the impact of asymptomatic cases on all infections over the coming period.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Rein Houben from the CMMID, who led the research, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We know that a substantial number of people infected with the coronavirus are asymptomatic, and there is anecdotal evidence that this group can transmit the virus, However, there are few reliable estimates on the proportion of people with Covid-19 who don\u2019t show symptoms, and their overall contribution to the spread of the virus.</p> \n   <p>This information is crucial for health policymakers to develop the most effective response strategies, including exiting from lockdowns. Using data from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, we aimed to help fill this knowledge gap.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T15:54:39.385Z\">at 4.54pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb2d72d8f08597eeb1b720c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T15:27:19.747Z\">4.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"556cf6cb22ca69700ffcc875f0369a3417d72595\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/556cf6cb22ca69700ffcc875f0369a3417d72595/0_236_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson at PMQs.

But, of course, there is no chance of PMQs resuming its shouting match status any time soon (one of the few benefits of this ghastly crisis) and instead Boris Johnson was left looking exposed and diminished as he faced Sir Keir Starmer for the first time.</p> \n  <p>As had been widely expected, Starmer was impressive \u2013 focused, calm, and rational. His interventions today were crisper than in his previous two outings (probably an improvement), and he always ended with a very direct question, simple yet incriminating. No doubt he could manage in a rowdy Commons, but the courtroom silence seems to suit him better, and the overall impression left by the encounter was of a rather floundering prime minister struggling to respond to a full-on grown-up channelling the questions a critical nation wants answering.</p> \n  <p>Another difficulty for the PM in Zoom PMQs is that he can\u2019t pick the brains of the specialist minister sitting alongside him. Prime ministers are normally more reliant on prompts from colleagues at PMQs than people realise, and Johnson looked particular in need of verbal assistance from Matt Hancock when asked about PPE.</p> \n  <p>In normal PMQs a struggling PM would resort to sloganising, and hope the backbench noise machine might do the rest, but with that no longer an option it did seem as if Johnson was more reliant on making points of substance. He could not answer Starmer\u2019s questions easily (they were designed to be hard to answer \u2013 at least, hard to answer without admitting gross negligence), but he did show some leg on a public inquiry, and provide a relatively revealing answer about why he is making the lockdown announcement on Sunday.</p> \n  <p>Starmer will be pleased with how the exchanges went. But if the new format militates against sloganising, then that is potentially a problem for the leader of the opposition too. At his first PMQs against Tony Blair, David Cameron came out with the memorable line about <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1504993/You-were-the-future-once.html\">how Blair \u201cwas the future once\u201d</a> \u2013 a soundbite and a slogan, but a good one, that defined Cameron successfully. A week today, we will remember that Starmer looked the part at his first PMQs, but we are less likely to remember what he actually said.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7f096d5dac89cbce07220f508fc55079de8dfdd\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7f096d5dac89cbce07220f508fc55079de8dfdd/0_110_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson speaking at PMQs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson speaking at PMQs.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Taylor/UK PARLIAMENT/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T15:25:22.222Z\">at 4.25pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb2a8438f0898654cef9874\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T12:06:38.336Z\">1.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54809a4eec44f2ab805f5141829adbb3098cc936\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54809a4eec44f2ab805f5141829adbb3098cc936/0_0_3500_2313/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Larry the cat sits in front of 10 Downing Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Larry the cat sits in front of 10 Downing Street.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb2a69e8f0898654cef9856\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/severincarrell\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T12:00:50.043Z\">1.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The proportion of all Scottish coronavirus deaths happening in care homes rose to 59% last week, up from 52% the week before, adding to the sense of crisis in the sector.</p> \n  <p><strong> National Records of Scotland</strong>, the government agency, said that deaths overall from Covid-19 had declined week on week for the first time since the outbreak began, with 523 deaths relating to the virus recorded in the week ending 3 May (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/06/uk-coronavirus-live-furlough-scheme-government-ease-lockdown-pmqs-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5eb29d6e8f0898654cef97ad#block-5eb29d6e8f0898654cef97ad\">12.22.</a>).</p> \n  <p>That was a fall of 135 from the previous week, with the data including deaths in all settings, including hospitals, homes and other places.

And double decker buses could end up carrying just 15 passengers, he says.</p> \n  <p>Here is an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s an inescapable fact that no mass transport system of the scale we have in London can operate at full capacity while maintaining social distancing at all times. Even with Tube ridership standing at just five per cent at the moment, there are times when passengers struggle to keep their distance. </p> \n   <p>This means that if the social distancing requirements remain in place, the total carrying capacity of the Tube will have to be reduced to between 13 to 20 per cent of pre-crisis levels \u2013 even with close to 100 per cent of trains running. We will also need to have a fundamentally different approach to operating stations, with strict queuing systems to limit the number of people who can access the network at any one time. Certain major stations where TfL and National Rail services interchange are likely to present the biggest challenge.</p> \n   <p>Likewise, there will need to be big changes to how we run the bus network. The carrying capacity of double decker buses could be reduced from 85 passengers to just 15. During the lockdown, we have been encouraging social distance queuing at some of our 21,500 bus stops by putting markings on the pavement. But this system will not be possible to maintain when passenger numbers start to increase. We are looking at possible solutions and have already started working with London boroughs to widen pavement space in key locations to alleviate the pressure. However, it will still be impossible to maintain social distance if passenger numbers increase even modestly.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>One consequence of this, Khan argues, is that in London \u201ceveryone who can work from home will have to be told to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb293048f0898654cef96e8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T10:42:27.872Z\">11.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Chinese in Britain 'too scared to venture out alone' amid rising levels of anti-Asian racism</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Rising levels of racist abuse that forced people of Chinese heritage to withdraw from UK society before the lockdown are likely to escalate when it lifts, an academic has warned.</p> \n  <p>Chinese people have been coughed at, attacked and told to \u201cgo back home\u201d, according to research led by Prof Binna Kandola. Reported experiences ranged from casual jokes to violent attacks and death threats, with people left too frightened to venture out alone and children ridiculed by their peers, 29 in-depth interviews with people of east Asian heritage revealed.</p> \n  <p>Kandola told the PA news agency that some people who have lived in the UK their whole life are questioning \u201cwhether people of Chinese heritage will ever be accepted as British\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Just over half of the 412 people surveyed said they had experienced an increase in discrimination during the Covid-19 outbreak. Three in 10 said they had witnessed or experienced discrimination at work, while 37% said they had experienced this outside the office. </p> \n  <p>One woman, an NHS doctor who works in her local hospital\u2019s respiratory unit, said she has stopped her daily morning jog because of the abuse. Another family withdrew their four-year-old boy from a football club after other parents told their children not to stand close to him.

Condemnation from leading politicians and the media would help those affected feel like they are being listened to, he said, while also suggesting local authorities direct victims of abuse to helplines or support groups. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There\u2019s a role for all of us to keep our eyes and ears open about what is going on around us and, when we see it, to intervene.</p> \n   <p>We are actually better than this.

We didn\u2019t used to, because it is harder to count deaths in the community and in care homes, and we now do ...</p> \n   <p>If you talk to the statisticians and the chief medical officer, what they say is it\u2019s only afterwards, looking back and looking at the total number who have died during the peak, compared to the normal number - because you\u2019ve also got to take into account the age profile, factors like obesity.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>What Hancock is saying about Italy contracts what No 10 said <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/882243/2020-04-29_COVID-19_Press_Conference_Slides.pdf\">in a caption to one of the slides shown at the daily press conference on 29 April</a>.

And he started by escalating the criticism of Prof Neil Ferguson, suggesting there could be a case for the police getting involved.</p> \n  <p>Asked by the presenter <strong>Kay Burley</strong> if Ferguson should be prosecuted for breaking the lockdown rules, Hancock replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You can imagine what my views are.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019s a matter for the police. As a government minister, I\u2019m not allowed to get involved in the operational decisions of police matters. But I think that the social distancing rules are very important and should be followed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Burley said that Dr Catherine Calderwood, the Scottish chief medical officer who resigned after it emerged she had visited her second home, had been issued with a warning by the police. Asked if he approved of what the police did in that situation, Hancock said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Absolutely I back the police. I back the Scottish police, I would back the police here. They will take their decisions independently from ministers, that\u2019s quite right. It\u2019s always been like that.</p> \n   <p>And that\u2019s why, even though I\u2019ve got a view as to what I think, as a minister the way we run the police is that they make their decisions like this. So I give them their space to make that decision. But I think he took the right decision to resign.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Hancock also said he was speechless when he heard what Ferguson had done. In his statement to the Daily Telegraph, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/05/exclusive-government-scientist-neil-ferguson-resigns-breaking/\">which broke the story</a>, Ferguson justified his decision to meet a lover who lived in another household on the grounds that he was acting on the basis that he was immune, because he had had coronavirus. But Hancock said that he had also had coronavirus and that he has specifically asked the chief medical officer if that meant he was at lower risk. Hancock said he had been told he still had to observe the social distancing rules.</p> \n  <p>Hancock could easily have dodged Burley\u2019s questions about police involvement, but he chose to answer in a way that clearly implied this was a case where the police might want to get involved.</p> \n  <p>However, in doing so, Hancock also suggested he is not fully familiar with the regulations imposing the lockdown rules on England - the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020, which Hancock himself introduced. These say that during the emergency period \u201cno person may leave the place where they are living without reasonable excuse\u201d.</p> \n  <p>But, according to the Telegraph story, Ferguson did not leave him house to see his lover. She came to visit him. There might be grounds for saying that she has broken the regulations, but not Ferguson.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"963772ac069d5ae89af0c53a00e3e2bd24561f6e\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/963772ac069d5ae89af0c53a00e3e2bd24561f6e/240_3_1487_892/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Hancock on Sky News with Kay Burley (left)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Hancock on Sky News with Kay Burley (left)</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: sky news</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T10:24:52.239Z\">at 11.24am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb27b6e8f085c470051f0da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T09:05:05.916Z\">10.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Yesterday Downing Street told us that Boris Johnson has started taking a daily walk around St James\u2019s Park as part of his lockdown exercise regime.

A polarised politics has taken hold. It views the world through a prism of winners and losers and sees compromise and co-operation as signs of weakness. Lost is the idea that countries do better by working together to solve common problems, even if doing so sometimes means an apparent sacrifice of short-term benefit for the greater good. In its place is a cynical calculus: \u201cI\u2019m right and you\u2019re either with me or against me.\u201d This is the world that the pandemic hit.</p> \n   <p>A highly infectious novel virus, life-threatening for many, might seem to be just the sort of thing countries would want to work together on.

And there will be, I\u2019m sure, plenty of reflection and time once we are through this terrible virus to be able to look at actions that have been taken and to see what lessons can be learned, what mistakes have been made. And every government I think will need to do that and we are no exception to that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The government has not yet confirmed that there will be a public inquiry into its handling of the coronavirus crisis once it is over, but Brokenshire\u2019s words may be the closest any minister has come to saying it\u2019s inevitable.</p> \n  <p>Asked the government\u2019s <strong>lockdown plans</strong>, Brokenshire said there is likely to be a \u201ccareful\u201d, \u201ccautious and thoughtful\u201d approach:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It does need to be done with that great care and thought, because the last thing that we need is another second surge, for the NHS to be overwhelmed and all of the issues that that would bring.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Pushed on <strong>testing</strong>, Brokenshire said the government decided to stop testing and tracing for coronavirus in the community on March 12 due to a \u201cshift\u201d in expert advice. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019ve always been informed by the expert advice in this. There was a shift in terms of how testing was done - we\u2019ve already heard about some of the issues of overall capacity at that point of time and some of the evidence that (Sir) Patrick Vallance, our chief scientific officer (sic), has given.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked whether, had there been the capacity, track-and-tracing should have continued, the Home Office minister said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Would there have been benefit in having that extra capacity, as Patrick Vallance highlighted in his evidence yesterday? Yes.</p> \n   <p>The challenge that we had was that we have some fantastic laboratories, some fantastic expertise, but it has been the capacity restraints that we have had, and therefore that has posed challenges, but also that has now been ramped up to go from 2,000 tests (per day) in February to 120,000 at the end of April.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Reminder: this is what the UK\u2019s chief scientific adviser<strong> Sir Patrick Vallance</strong> told the Commons Health Select Committee yesterday:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> I think that probably we, in the early phases, and I\u2019ve said this before, I think if we\u2019d managed to ramp testing capacity quicker it would have been beneficial.</p> \n   <p>And, you know, for all sorts of reasons that didn\u2019t happen.</p> \n   <p>I think it\u2019s clear you need lots of testing for this [but] it\u2019s completely wrong to think of testing as the answer.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019s just part of the system that you need to get right. The entire system needs to work properly.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Brokenshire defended the decision <strong>not to close UK borders</strong> in a bid to stop the virus spreading across the country, after Vallance said most of the coronavirus strains being spread across the UK in March came from people returning from Spain and Italy. Brokenshire said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think it is important to note that the scientific advice was very clear that, up to this point in time, placing restrictions at the border would not have had any significant impact on epidemic progression in the UK. </p> \n   <p>Sage looked at this on March 23 - the numbers coming from other countries were estimated to be insignificant compared with domestic cases, comprising around 0.5% of total cases at the time.</p> \n   <p>Since then, obviously, you\u2019ll be more than aware, with all of the issues in the aviation sector, how we\u2019ve seen a reduction in air passengers by around 99% since the start of the outbreak.</p> \n   <p>It is something we will continue to keep under review as we look to the next phase but, at that time, the advice was clear that placing restrictions would not have had any significant impact.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"001a1982ed967b47e55d3e2c3ac4610ccc8fdfa6\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/001a1982ed967b47e55d3e2c3ac4610ccc8fdfa6/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Brokenshire, the security minister.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Brokenshire, the security minister.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T08:51:05.259Z\">at 9.51am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb26a948f085c470051f052\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T07:45:22.478Z\">8.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Prof Ferguson right to step down, says minister</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Security Minister <strong>James Brokenshire</strong> has called Prof Neil Ferguson\u2019s resignation a \u201cmatter of regret\u201d but an \u201cappropriate course\u201d of action.

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are still very firmly discussing with the sector, with Public Health England and reaching out to ensure that capacity is reaching where it needs to be.</p> \n   <p>That work still continues. We are obviously concerned about issues in care homes, ensuring there is that reach - it is there in terms of the capacity, having gone up - and how we ensure we can get that further, where it is needed, given the whole point of investing in that was to ensure that it can give that sense of reassurance.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T08:44:12.819Z\">at 9.44am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb2662c8f085c470051f035\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T07:25:15.815Z\">8.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Will coronavirus spell the end of the party for Ibiza?</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/06/its-a-tough-island-to-live-on-why-coronavirus-spells-doom-for-ibiza\">'It's a tough island to live on': why coronavirus spells doom for Ibiza</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb263548f085c470051f02b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T07:14:36.202Z\">8.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>My colleague <strong>Steven Morris</strong> has this report on the name change of the <strong>national assembly of Wales</strong>:</p> \n  <p>There will be no fanfare and little ceremony but the body formerly known as the national assembly of Wales has a new name.</p> \n  <p>From now it will be known as Senedd Cymru \u2013 the Welsh parliament.

  "<p>My father, David Dent, who has died aged 97, produced 13 feature films in the 1950s giving British actors such as Diana Dors, Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan, Sid James and Petula Clark some of their earliest big-screen roles.</p> <p>He was born Cecil David Abrahams in Glasgow to Arthur Abrahams and his wife, Hettie (nee Lazarus). Arthur was a charismatic and successful travelling film salesman who changed his surname to Dent after the picturesque village of that name in the Yorkshire Dales. The family moved to London when David was two and he attended University College school before going to St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in 1940 to study jurisprudence.</p> <p>After a year of study, during which he won the Winter Williams law scholarship, David was commissioned into the army, eventually joining the 4th Hussars, Winston Churchill\u2019s old regiment. (While producing the BBC documentary series Timewatch in the 1990s, I was astonished to spot my father among a huge crowd of soldiers in a 1943 British Path\u00e9 newsreel covering Churchill\u2019s trip to Egypt.) He landed in Italy in April 1944 and saw active service as a tank troop leader as the allies pushed north. Mentioned in dispatches and promoted to captain, he ended the war in Austria.</p> <p>On home leave in September 1945, David found that his Oxford scholarship granted him early demobilisation. He graduated in 1947 and served as a pupil to the barrister and novelist Henry Cecil Leon, author of the successful Brothers in Law series.</p> <p>In 1949, David joined his father and elder brother <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/08/stanley-dent-obituary\">Stanley</a> in the family business, Adelphi Films, an independent distribution and production company. He produced a diverse variety of British films, ranging from the football comedy The Great Game (1953) and Is Your Honeymoon Really Necessary (1953), both starring Diana Dors, to dramas such as The Crowded Day (1954) and Intimate Relations (1953), whose incestuous undertones gained it an X certificate. He produced Penny Points to Paradise and Let\u2019s Go Crazy (1951), both comedy feature films starring Sellers and Milligan. My Death Is a Mockery (1952), about capital punishment, was withdrawn from circulation after it was said to have inspired the 16-year-old Christopher Craig to murder a policeman. In later life, David ran a fashion publishing business and a commercial property company. He retired in 2007, aged 85.</p> <p>In 1957, David married Jos\u00e9 Crayson, a television producer; she died in 2015.

  "<p>On a sun-speckled, tree-lined street on a sunny Sunday afternoon, Ahmaud Arbery ran through his neighborhood in the coastal town of Brunswick, Georgia.

She\u2019d heard he used to wave to another neighbor on his daily runs.</p> \n<p>It should just have been another ordinary run for the 25-year-old Arbery back in February. But a series of events unfolded that ended in his brutal killing at the hands of two white men, which has caused anger across America and especially among black Americans and campaigners for social justice.</p> \n<p>Now, as Bennett watches the video of how his last run through her neighborhood ended in his death, she cries.</p> \n<p>That sorrow \u2013 and rage \u2013 has spread through Georgia and the rest of the US, and has reignited a long-running debate over the killings of young black men by white people.

Another shot rings out as Arbery struggles back into frame as yet another shot is heard. Finally, he falls to the ground.</p> \n<p>Before police made it to Arbery, he was already dead.</p> \n<p>According to a police report, the two men, Gregory McMichael, 64, and his son, Travis McMichael, 34, had grabbed their weapons, a .357 Magnum revolver and a shotgun, jumped into a truck and began following Arbery after seeing him run by.</p> \n<p>In the video, it appears Arbery is running in the moments leading up to his death.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ff982312-edb3-412b-afb8-5d08db8a14a9\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8EysSdqmQQI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The two men involved in the incident have not been charged or arrested over Arbery\u2019s death, but the case will now go to a grand jury following the release of the video and the condemnation that it produced, according to a statement from the district attorney in charge, Tom Durden.</p> \n<p>This month, the state chapter of the NAACP visited Arbery\u2019s family, calling for an end to race-based discrimination in Brunswick, a majority African American city.

Tamir Rice was killed at a playground in Ohio; Terence Crutcher slain while being pulled over by police; and Walter Scott shot dead in South Carolina after a traffic stop.</p> \n<p>L Chris Stewart, an Atlanta-based civil rights attorney who has represented a number of families like Arbery\u2019s, has a close relationship with the lawyer representing Arbery\u2019s mother. The two have spoken about what happened to Arbery. When Stewart first heard what happened, he thought to himself, \u201cI jog and I live in a predominantly white neighborhood now. And, you know, if someone suspects you\u2019re a criminal because you\u2019re black, then this is going to turn into the Wild Wild West.\u201d</p> \n<p>Glynn county, where Brunswick sits, has a history of controversy in its police departments. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.wtoc.com/2020/02/28/glynn-county-vidalia-police-chiefs-indicted/\">a former county police officer was indicted</a>. Initially, the prosecutors involved with the case chose not to press charges against the elder McMichael and his son. Documents and state records show the older McMichael is a <a href=\"https://law.georgia.gov/press-releases/2009-02-25/execution-date-set-man-convicted-glynn-county-murder\">former police detective</a> and <a href=\"https://thebrunswicknews.com/news/local_news/judge-signs-order-of-execution/article_5197ce3d-f667-5533-af39-665c715b6b98.html\">district attorney investigator</a> in Glynn county.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a really corrupt police department,\u201d Stewart said.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday night, more than two months after Arbery was shot in the middle of the street, the Georgia bureau of investigations announced the Glynn county police had not asked them to investigate the shooting, but rather, looked into threats against those involved in the investigation.</p> \n<p>The state\u2019s governor and attorney general spoke out after the video was released on Tuesday. \u201cI expect justice to be carried out as swiftly as possible,\u201d the attorney general, Chris Carr, said in a statement.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday evening, Bennett saw dozens of people coming to and from a protest in front of the McMichaels\u2019 home. On Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.wsbtv.com/news/georgia/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-gbi-joins-investigation-video-surfaces-social-media/CCIAX3SWRVEDRI63SA5RDBZHVE/\">protest</a><a href=\"https://www.wsbtv.com/news/georgia/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-gbi-joins-investigation-video-surfaces-social-media/CCIAX3SWRVEDRI63SA5RDBZHVE/\">ers gathered</a> in Atlanta at the state capitol.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on through the McMichaels\u2019 heads, and if they think the black community is shaken. But all races are hurt. We\u2019re all upset,\u201d Bennett said.</p> \n<p>But she was not surprised this happened in Brunswick \u2013 or anywhere in America.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s just racism, honestly. To me, it\u2019s never gonna die.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Guardian has published an edited version of the video after Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Arbery\u2019s father, said the family consented to its public dissemination.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 7 May 2020. Walter Scott was shot dead in South Carolina after a traffic stop, not shot dead in Louisiana leaving a convenience store as an earlier version said. An erroneous suggestion that four shots, rather than three, had been fired at Ahmaud Arbery was also corrected.</p>",
  "<p>The announcement on Monday that Sydney\u2019s Carriageworks had entered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/05/carriageworks-goes-into-voluntary-administration-citing-irreparable-loss-of-income-due-to-coronavirus\">voluntary administration</a> came as a shock for an arts community already in brace position.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the first big announcement like this but I can tell you now, it won\u2019t be the last,\u201d says Esther Anatolitis, executive director of the National Association of Visual Arts. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing right across Australia is a total loss of self-generated income for galleries. As yet, there\u2019s no strategy looking at how to financially support galleries so that they will be able to survive and reopen.\u201d</p> <p>Carriageworks has been one of the jewels of Sydney\u2019s performance and exhibition venues since 2007, hosting some of the largest-scale art installations seen in Australia at its historic 50-hectare site at the Eveleigh rail yard complex.

The decision to enter into administration was sealed when the New South Wales government \u2013 which currently does not have an arts minister after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/10/nsw-minister-don-harwin-fined-1000-for-breaching-coronavirus-public-health-order\">the recent resignation of Don Harwin</a> \u2013 declined to guarantee future funding.

The Covid-19 shutdown has come hard on the heels of cuts to Australia Council funding and a summer of bushfires that had an impact on gallery attendance and operations, most notably in Canberra.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/05/carriageworks-administrators-tightlipped-but-expected-to-ask-for-bailout\">Sydney Opera House may take over Carriageworks as calls for state bailout grow</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All galleries Australia-wide are closed until further notice.

All I can say is that they were truly horrible.\u201d</p> <p>Government funding accounts for about 25% of the MCA\u2019s budget, says Macgregor. The rest comes from venue hire (including weddings and corporate events), the museum\u2019s retail and caf\u00e9 operations, and philanthropy. Apart from special exhibits, the MCA does not charge an entrance fee.</p> <p>\u201cThat was our much-lauded funding mix,\u201d Macgregor says with an exasperated laugh. \u201cAnd before this crisis, everyone thought that was a great thing. Even the GFC didn\u2019t impact us very much. But this time, 40% of our income vanished overnight. It throws into question the whole orthodoxy of that kind of funding. Those of us who developed really good business models are particularly suffering, much more so than the institutions who get 60, 70, 80% of their funding from government.\u201d</p> <p>The MCA\u2019s philanthropic community has been supportive. \u201cActually, they\u2019ve been fantastic, telling us that they understand we can\u2019t use the money in the way we wanted to but to please spend it to keep the museum going,\u201d Macgregor says, adding that she has ruled out bringing back an admission fee for the MCA.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64133c5c13f8006dc9abe8b9e1d401938f4c5d3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64133c5c13f8006dc9abe8b9e1d401938f4c5d3e/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Virtual Vibration\u2019 is is projected onto the facade of the MCA during a media preview for Vivid Sydney in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Virtual Vibration\u2019 is is projected onto the facade of the MCA during a media preview for Vivid Sydney in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Metcalfe/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As it stands, access to the jobkeeper scheme is not an option for Australia\u2019s local council, university or state-owned institutions.</p> <p>\u201cOur permanent full-time and temporary staff continue to work behind the scenes while our doors are closed to the public,\u201d says Michael Brand, director of the Art Gallery of New South Wales. \u201cDuring this period we have also sought to retain and redeploy a number of our regular casuals within the gallery.\u201d</p> <p>Adelaide\u2019s Art Gallery of South Australia is in a similar position.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing all we can to look after our small number of casuals, some of whom are assisting us to deliver our online programs,\u201d says Rhana Devenport, AGSA\u2019s director, adding that permanent and contract staff had been asked to exhaust all leave entitlements.</p> <p>Like all arts and entertainment enterprises, Australia\u2019s art galleries are keenly awaiting updated advice on social distancing.

[State] borders are going to open again and all those people who normally go overseas and spend money \u2013 something like $6bn \u2013 are going to be here and we want to grab some of that, but the museums are going to have to work together,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cCultural tourists spend three times as much as other tourists, so for the sake of the economy, we need a stimulus package that will allow organisations like ours to reopen.\u201d</p>",

Witty vitriol is blasted at Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton \u2013 the former sending \u201cout-of-office\u201d alohas from Hawaii while waiting for divine intervention, the latter cast as his hapless righthand man. \u201cEverything is burning, better turn the fucking cricket on,\u201d is only the second wittiest line in a song filled with them; the best is left to last, spat angrily by both: \u201cEven the Ruby Princess had a fucking captain.\u201d </p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Briggs will have new music out in mid-2020. Minchin\u2019s debut album will be released this year.</p> <h2>Vacations \u2013 Lavender</h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>the Mock Turtles, the Telescopes, the Cure</p> <p>A skipping baggy beat and ethereal keyboards try their best to anchor a heavenly track that threatens to float into the cotton candy clouds at any moment. Vacations could easily sit alongside the many NME-endorsed UK groups of the 80s that no doubt influenced them; those who built upon Johnny Marr\u2019s guitars and New Order\u2019s beats to bring sunshine to any number of damp and dreary housing estates in the Thatcher era. Lavender sounds like the type of track you\u2019d discover on an old C86 tape so it\u2019s no real surprise to learn that Oscar Dawson \u2013 from fellow 80s revivalists Holy Holy \u2013 produced the song. The songwriter, Campbell Burns, may be a student of the indie songbook but it takes more than a keen ear and a book full of hooks to craft melodies this memorable.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>the album Forever in Bloom will be out this year.</p> <h2>Josh Pyke \u2013 Doubting Thomas</h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>Sufjan Stevens, Neil Finn, Darren Hanlon</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e8caa00414d215a41be3d99bf2ba675f763c4e39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8caa00414d215a41be3d99bf2ba675f763c4e39/860_0_4630_3974/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Josh Pyke\" width=\"1000\" height=\"858\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Josh Pyke.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sony Music</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over the course of five albums and seven EPs, Sydney\u2019s Josh Pyke has maintained his signature sound as trends slide in and out of fashion, giving his 2017 best-of record a rare and easy unity. Doubting Thomas could have slotted on to any of those records, opening with Pyke\u2019s almost whispered vocal and a steady acoustic strum before a rustic 4/4 beat and his sliding falsetto provide yet another classic Pyke chorus. Like his breakthrough hit Middle of the Hill, the familiar and familial rub up against each other, with fingers running over metaphorical scars, a farewell tinged with regret and hope, and a visit to unnamed cousins all colliding. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to read a book in the dark,\u201d he sings of the shadows cast by the titular Doubting Thomases. Another brilliant and evocative song to add to a catalogue filled with them.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Pyke will tour nationally in October (hopefully).</p> <h2>Kit \u2013 Good Guy</h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>Angel Olsen, PJ Harvey</p> <p>A great many songs have been written about guys who are all smiles and shine until the veneer wears off and the true, ugly self is revealed. But in Good Guy, the debut single from Katie Wighton from All Our Exes Live in Texas, she isn\u2019t after sympathy, apologies, or any form of closure; as the song proclaims, this issue is bigger than them both. A far cry from the four-part folk of her aforementioned band, this is a chugging rocker reminiscent of PJ Harvey or perhaps Ali Barter, who co-wrote it and provides the warm harmonies. Boy and Bear- and Missy Higgins-producer Dave Symes lets the guitars drive the track while ensuring that Wighton\u2019s aching voice is front and centre. Hopefully an album is on the way.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Check out When We Fall by All Our Exes \u2013 but be warned, it\u2019s quite different!</p> <h2>Gum \u2013 Don\u2019t Let It Go Out</h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>MGMT, Mercury Rev, the Beach Boys</p> <p>Since the 2012 release of the Tame Impala hit Elephant, which he co-wrote and played keys for, Jay Watson has circled the world numerous times with Kevin Parker and co, put out four internationally acclaimed albums with his Perth band Pond, and is now gearing up to release his fifth solo album under the name Gum \u2013 an abbreviation of his childhood nickname Gumby. Opening with a gentle arpeggio that would be at home on a mid-60s Beach Boys record, Watson sings a fittingly plodding vocal melody over lightly distorted bass, dewdrop keyboards and a strolling structure that cares little for traditional verse/chorus fare. It\u2019s a dreamy tune; a moodboard for the forthcoming album, and a gentle salve for turbulence times.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Gum\u2019s fifth album Out in the World will be out 12 June.</p> <h2>Yibby - No Sweat</h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>Anderson Paak, Big Sean, Jhene Aiko</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3793449f2dc7b97ae064c3eaf5496091209bf44c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3793449f2dc7b97ae064c3eaf5496091209bf44c/348_589_1528_1527/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yibby\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australian hip-hop artist Yibby.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Collected PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With a bedding track that twinkles like a twilight dream, keys warped beyond recognition and a dexterous and smooth vocal to bump along to, No Sweat would work as a Sunday comedown mixtape or as fuel for a Saturday night gear-up. Yibby, Ethoipian-born and brought up in south Sydney, possesses singular talent \u2013 and although the flow on No Sweat isn\u2019t the most original, it provides a perfect template for the 20-year-old to showcase his inventive lyrical skills and his warm, welcome voice.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Check out his Lost in Translation EP or his 2018 single Woah.</p> <h2>Lime Cordiale \u2013 On Our Own</h2> <p><strong>For fans of:</strong> Holy Holy, Arctic Monkeys, M83</p> <p>If you had our above playlist on random in the background, you could be forgiven for wondering how a British electro-pop tune from the 80s accidentally ended up in the mix, such is the faithful reproduction of song and style that On Our Own represents. But while such easy classification suggests pastiche, Lime Cordiale have in fact carved out fertile and original ground over their career so far, with a jumble of disparate influences that mix and mesh to form a strong and charming whole. There\u2019s more than a touch of Alex Turner\u2019s elongated syllabic sneer here, with bright keys that belong to an 80s sci-fi flick and militant drums that signal the anthemic chorus to come.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>their second album 14 Steps to a Better You will be out on 14 July.</p> <h2>DMA\u2019s \u2013 The Glow</h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>the Happy Mondays, New Order,</p> <p>Speaking of UK inspirations: to chart the course of the DMA\u2019s storied career so far is to listen to a study of British music in reverse order \u2013 from the Oasis-aping beginnings, through to their Stone Roses shimmer and now to a beat-driven, key-drenched sound that would be at home at all-night Hacienda raves in the early 80s. Tommy O\u2019Dell\u2019s angelic voice is lightly distorted and pushed further back in the mix than usual, giving this song a rolling quality that makes it perfect for driving through tunnels in the middle of the night, on the way to wherever you happen to end up.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>DMA\u2019s third album The Glow is out 10 July.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3563ca5de00328ce490dc36dd4115844320e0061\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3563ca5de00328ce490dc36dd4115844320e0061/115_82_760_918/414.jpg\" alt=\"Bugs\" width=\"414\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brisbane\u2019s Bugs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Grima</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Bugs</strong> \u2013 Can\u2019t Get Enough</h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>Klinger, Jebediah, Kisschasy</p> <p>Bugs have been Brisbane\u2019s best-kept secret for quite some time now but last summer the band\u2019s hooky pop anthem Seriously broke through to a national audience after some serious attention from the national youth broadcaster. Echoing the gleeful pop rock that peaked in Perth during the 90s but is at home in any city or decade, Can\u2019t Get Enough finds the three-piece sharpening their songwriting tools and adopting a cleaner, yet still crunchy, production sound. It\u2019s a welcome harbinger of their third album, which, if there is any justice, should dominate airways later this year.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Check out their previous two albums, and their excellent cover of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXPvvXJ7Vq8\">Mallrat\u2019s Charlie for Like a Version</a>.</p> <h2>Saint Lane \u2013 The Family</h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>Kendrick Lamar, Antony and the Johnsons, A Tribe Called Quest</p> <p>Over haunting horns and a Shiloh Dynasty sample that seems transmitted from a crackling pirate radio station from the 40s, Saint Lane raps his most personal lyrics yet. Born to Fijian and French parents in New Zealand, and now based on the Gold Coast, he shares a story of disconnect, of fractured family relations, and of generational pain; a story he was \u201cextremely hesitant\u201d to release. \u201cIt feels very exposing,\u201d he admits in the press release, \u201cbut as an artist I know vulnerability is the most honest way to present art.\u201d The Family is a masterwork; a hypnagogic, half-remembered hymn to blood and birthright.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Listen to his previous single Hickeys.</p>",

Retailers should use contactless payment and limit the number of customers allowed into their shop at the same time.</p> <p>For workers such as taxi drivers, it might be physically impossible to keep a 1.5m distance between themselves and the customer. One suggestion on the Safe Work website is for taxi and ride-share drivers to install a perspex screen between the front and back seats.</p> <h2><strong>The end of all-staff meetings and communal lunches</strong></h2> <p>All non-essential gatherings, meetings and training should be postponed, cancelled or conducted via tele or video conferencing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/05/australian-restaurants-and-cafes-present-plans-to-come-out-of-coronavirus-shutdown\">Australian restaurants and cafes present plans to come out of coronavirus shutdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In fact, workplaces should also try to stagger meal breaks and start times to reduce the number of workers using common spaces at the same time.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendon Murphy, said on Tuesday that staggering start and finish times could also help ease public transport congestion.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want everybody crowding on public transport at the same time, we don\u2019t want everyone crowding in the lifts at the beginning of the day and the end of the day,\u201d he said.</p> <h2><strong>Cleaning, cleaning, cleaning</strong></h2> <p>Workplaces will have to be cleaned at least daily using detergent, and disinfected as needed depending on how high-traffic the area is.</p> <p>In retail stores, that means regularly cleaning counters, phones, Eftpos machines and even clothes racks.</p> <p>It may be difficult to disinfect high-contact areas multiple times in a shift; in those cases a workplace may need to limit the number of people coming into contact with that area.</p> <p>For taxi drivers, this may mean telling passengers not to open the doors from the outside themselves to avoid disinfecting the handle after each ride. For those in an office space, it may mean the end of hot-desking.</p> <h2><strong>On-site temperature checks</strong></h2> <p>SafeWork acknowledges that there may be times where it is reasonable for employers to administrator temperature checks to staff when they reopen. These include situations where staff live together in accommodation, such as agricultural workers, or in workplaces where vulnerable people are, like aged care facilities.</p> <p>But on the whole, a temperature check isn\u2019t going to definitively prove someone has Covid-19, and SafeWork says \u201cthere may be little benefit\u201d. </p> <h2><strong>What do the experts say about a return to work?</strong></h2> <p>In terms of whether this is the right time for businesses to open up again, leading epidemiologist Prof Tony Blakely says \u201cthere is absolutely no question\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEverything comes down to whether the goal [in Australia] is elimination or suppression [of the virus],\u201d Blakely says. \u201cAssuming we are going for suppression, then absolutely we should try and open things back up, but it should be done in tranches.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to accept there will be some low amount of community transmission, but we need to stamp those cases out as quickly as we can.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/coronavirus-and-airborne-transmission-scientists-warn-australia-to-be-on-guard\">Coronavirus and airborne transmission: scientists warn Australia to be on guard</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Dr Libby Sander, assistant professor of organisational behaviour at Bond University, says Safe Work\u2019s guidelines pose challenges that may deter some businesses from inviting staff back into the office.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a lot of discussion about bringing teams into offices on certain days,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if there was hot-desking in place, which is the case for a lot of high corporates in Australia, there would have to be a deep cleaning done at the end of the day before the next shift comes in. This is a significant change and cost for a lot of businesses.</p> <p>\u201cI also think the genie is out of the bottle that working from home is possible and we can\u2019t go back on that. We will see that people will work from home two days a week, maybe.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>I\u2019m concerned about the proposal discussed in Owen Bowcott\u2019s article (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/apr/26/non-jury-trials-could-help-clear-coronavirus-backlog-says-geoffrey-robertson-qc\" title=\"\">Non-jury trials could help clear coronavirus backlog, says QC</a>, 26 April). The clogging up of the system must not be addressed by the offer of judge-only trials. In the UK, judge-only trials are reserved for a tiny residue of exceptional cases where there is risk of jury tampering. </p> <p>Our prisons face a coronavirus crisis and some 9,000 remand prisoners are facing delays. Whatever the accusation, we must resist offering these vulnerable people a judge-only trial. Many could be tempted out of desperation to embroil themselves in proceedings usually reserved for the most manipulative defendants in the land. Rather than raise the inducement of judge-only trial, parliament must find ways to recommence jury trials.</p> <p>Lawyers cherish a criminal justice process steeped in trial by random selection of peers. If judge-only trial was thought comparable to trial by jury, it would long ago have gained equal status. It has not. The presumption of innocence is an indispensable feature of our society. Jury trial is the lifeblood. It must not become another victim of this crisis.<br><strong>Jeremy Dein QC</strong><br><em>London</em></p>",
  "<p>Facebook has announced the members of its new oversight board, an international committee of judges, journalists and academics who will help steer the company\u2019s policy on freedom of expression.</p> <p>Among the 20 board members who have agreed to help set policy for the social network are Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the former prime minister of Denmark; the Nobel peace laureate Tawakkol Karman; and Alan Rusbridger, the former Guardian editor-in-chief.</p> <p>The first four members of the board, who all hold the title of co-chair, were selected by Facebook directly. Thorning-Schmidt is one, and is joined by two US law professors, Jamal Greene and Michael McConnell, and Catalina Botero Marino, a former special rapporteur for freedom of expression at the Organization of American States. </p> <p>Those four, in combination with Facebook, selected the next 16 members and will continue to appoint board members until the board hits its full complement of 40. At that point, Facebook says it will drop out of the process, leaving the board fully in charge of its own composition.</p> <p>\u201cOur roster includes three former judges, six former or current journalists, and other leaders with backgrounds from civil society, academia and public service,\u201d said Thomas Hughes, the director of the oversight board. \u201cThey represent a diverse collection of backgrounds and beliefs, but all have a deep commitment to advancing human rights and freedom of expression.\u201d</p> <p>First proposed by Mark Zuckerberg in 2018, the oversight board is Facebook\u2019s attempt to extricate itself from the uncomfortable position of ruling on free speech issues around the world. The board will arbitrate difficult decisions about content moderation, based both on appeals from users, and self-referrals from Facebook itself.</p> <p>Facebook donated \u201cirrevocable funding for an independent trust\u201d to run the board, said Facebook\u2019s director of governance and global affairs, Brent Harris, and has committed to \u201cimplement the board\u2019s decisions unless doing so breaks the law\u201d.</p> <p>Thorning-Schmidt, who served as CEO of Save the Children after leaving office and is married to the Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, said she \u201clooked forward to the challenge\u201d that the board\u2019s work would bring.</p> <p>\u201cIn this health crisis we are seeing that social media helps us stay connected. But there\u2019s a downside: it can spread speech that is hateful, deceitful and harmful,\u201d she said. \u201cUntil now some of the most difficult decisions about moderation have been made by Facebook and, ultimately, by Mark Zuckerberg himself. But we will now for the first time have an independent body that will take final and binding decisions on what content stays up and what content is removed.\u201d</p> <p>Rusbridger, who was editor-in-chief of the Guardian from 1995 until 2015, said. \u201cThe oversight board seems to be the first imaginative and bold step by one of the biggest players to find a way of reconciling the need to start imposing some kind of judgment and standards on what is published, while still maintaining the things that are wonderful about social media, and necessary for free speech. I\u2019m impressed by the group of people that has been chosen and the processes that have been put in place.\u201d</p> <p>Hughes, when asked if the independence of the board could stretch to it taking on oversight for other social networks if they requested it, confirmed that it could. \u201cBut I think all the co-chairs would agree with me that in the short term there is an enormous challenge in just dealing with the requests from Facebook and Instagram alone,\u201d he said.</p>",

I am obsessed with everything Daisy Edgar-Jones wears on screen for the whole, blissful 12 episodes. The spaghetti strap sundress she wears for an afternoon bike ride and an ice-cream in an Italian piazza is surely the most delicious ballerina-length black dress since the bare-shouldered satin cocktail dress with the bateau-neckline and the bow-tied shoulders Hubert de Givenchy made for Audrey Hepburn in the film Sabrina in 1954. (A dress so iconic that it is known as the \u201c<a href=\"https://alisonkerr.wordpress.com/2011/03/20/style-on-film-sabrina/\">Sabrina dress</a>\u201d. )</p> <p>Then there is the short A-line tunic in sun-faded gingham Marianne wears by the pool in another scene from that Trieste holiday. With her lush fringe and coltish beauty, the vibe is pure Jane Birkin circa 1969. And the yellow sleeveless blouse in which she bolts in late to the school exam hall, when everyone else is in uniform. And don\u2019t get my started on the cream V-neck blouse with the black silk scarf and the dangling shell earrings.</p> <p>Normal People is not about clothes. Indeed, lots of the very best bits of Normal People are the scenes where Marianne and Connell have no clothes on at all. But I think we all know by now that Marianne\u2019s sweaty sex hair and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/04/normal-people-connell-chain-reaction-unbridled-lust\">Connell\u2019s chain</a> are iconic, so I will spare you more thigh-rubbing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1db30f6d0771a2f54b2cd14bd690916c26438707\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1db30f6d0771a2f54b2cd14bd690916c26438707/202_0_629_629/500.jpg\" alt=\"Normal People\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cream V-neck blouse with the black silk scarf and the dangling shell earrings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Normal People</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maybe it is a marker of how good Normal People is that it not about clothes and yet the clothes are still brilliant. Or maybe it\u2019s because Normal People is not about clothes that the clothes are brilliant. When television makes noise in fashion it is usually for cutting-edge, scene-stealing looks by of-the-moment designers: Villanelle wearing The Vampire\u2019s Wife in the new season of Killing Eve, say. But this show\u2019s Emmy-nominated costume designer, Lorna Marie Mugan, whose previous credits include the stylish and very influential Peaky Blinders, dressed Marianne in a mix of high street and vintage, with a few pieces from Mugan\u2019s own wardrobe.</p> <p>The clue to the magic of Normal People is in the name; not the normal part, the people part. Sally Rooney\u2019s fine-grained characterisation of Marianne is all there on the small screen. It\u2019s in her summer-holiday plimsolls and her washed-out underwear, the protective jumpers she wears to the library and her flimsy, over-exposing party dresses.</p> <p>If Rooney is the first great millennial novelist, Marianne is the first great millennial TV style icon. The show captures the way young women look now. The one-piece swimming costume instead of the bikini, the bedroom loungewear that spans essay-writing and sleeping. The high-waisted jeans, and the short party dresses. Even Marianne\u2019s slenderness \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/are-sally-rooney-s-heroines-too-skinny-1.4021294\">often mentioned in the book</a> \u2013 is accentuated in the modern way, in the looseness of a pair of jeans or the leotard fit of a vest, rather than the old-fashioned methods of darted tailoring, or waist-cinching belts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a53a558cd6b1e3c31879eec5c8ebdbe13d308b66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a53a558cd6b1e3c31879eec5c8ebdbe13d308b66/0_0_884_723/500.jpg\" alt=\"Marianne Normal People\" width=\"500\" height=\"409\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marianne in a short A-line tunic in sun-faded gingham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Normal People</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mugan wanted to show how teenage style evolves in the years from adolescence to college. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to just shake off everything that was part of their youth,\u201d she told Grazia about how the clothes changed in Marianne and Connell\u2019s move from Sligo to Dublin. \u201cYou take little bits of them with them. You explore how they find themselves as they evolve. Subtlety was the key.\u201d During Marianne\u2019s first year at Trinity, and on that idyllic Italian holiday, she is trying on a new sophistication for size. On a visit home to Sligo the high-school princess contemporaries who still wear their hair in shiny prom-night ringlets look calcified next to the modishly tousled Marianne, like once-prized dolls now gathering dust. Trapped at home with her awful family, her wardrobe regresses from Trinity urbanity into cut-off denim skirts and plimsolls.<br><br>Edgar-Jones told iD magazine that working with Mugan on Marianne\u2019s wardrobe was one of her favourite parts of making Normal People. \u201cIt was so fun,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen the outfit feels right you can adopt the physicality much more easily, because your clothes kind of dictate the way you navigate the world \u2026 as [Marianne] ages, she stops needing to be so out there and feels comfortable to wear clothes that fit and feel good.\u201d Perhaps you have more self-control than me and haven\u2019t gulped down the last episodes yet, so I will stop there. But Normal People has the makings of a fashion classic.</p>",
  "<h2>Trevor Noah</h2> <p>On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah examined the escalating \u201ccorona mask wars\u201d since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html\">revised its guidelines</a> to encourage people to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html\">wear a mask</a> in public. \u201cNow, this all seems reasonable enough, right? Everyone just needs to wear a mask when you\u2019re gonna be outside around other people,\u201d said Noah. \u201cBut apparently, it\u2019s the furthest thing from simple.\u201d Outlets across the country reported this weekend on people refusing to wear masks, in some cases <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/oklahoma-city-ends-face-mask-rule-shoppers-after-store-employees-n1198736\">threatening store employees</a> who attempted to enforce the order.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are people so angry?\u201d asked Noah. \u201cForget a vaccine, scientists need to start working on a chill pill. Health officials are asking for <em>us</em> to cover <em>our</em> faces to protect <em>ourselves,</em> and everyone is acting like they have to get spayed and neutered. And the people who don\u2019t wear masks are ruining it for everyone.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1257855285286371328\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Many Americans refuse to wear a mask because it makes it harder to breathe.

First, he conceded, they\u2019re not very comfortable. Which is why a woman in Kentucky <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-20200504-qjpnujrrpzdtzlxlsavkfanjie-story.html\">went viral</a> for wearing a mask \u2026 with holes cut into it for her nose and mouth to make it \u201ceasier to breathe\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI think some people are missing the point of the mask: it\u2019s not about conforming, it\u2019s about safety,\u201d Noah explained. \u201cCan you imagine if people brought this attitude to sex? \u2018Don\u2019t worry, babe, of course I used a condom. I just ripped the top off because it was really uncomfortable for my penis and made it look like it was robbing a bank. But we\u2019re good!

Both incidents have given license to people who have adopted not wearing a mask as a political position.</p> <p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t even understand how a public health issue like wearing a mask became so politicized,\u201d Noah concluded. \u201cBut it is really weird to me that so many of these people who refuse to wear masks claim to be proud patriots who would do anything for their country. Because right now, America is at war with the coronavirus. And if you\u2019re going out in public without wearing a mask, well then, you\u2019re fighting for the other side.\u201d</p> <h2>Stephen Colbert</h2> <p>\u201cWhen Trump said as the weather gets warmer [coronavirus] would miraculously go away, I didn\u2019t know he meant our response,\u201d said Stephen Colbert on the Late Show about news that the White House is allegedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/05/white-house-coronavirus-taskforce-winding-down-why\">winding down the coronavirus taskforce</a>, even as cases <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/us/coronavirus-live-updates.html\">are projected to rise in the US</a>.

But he\u2019s gonna want to make one small change,\u201d said Colbert over the photo of an amended banner: \u201cTransmission Accomplished.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt seems really doubtful that we can reopen the economy this soon and keep the disaster under control,\u201d Colbert continued. \u201cBut of course, anyone who\u2019s seen Donald Trump knows he always wants to have his cake and grope it too, because even though Trump made a big deal about releasing his own social distancing guidelines, he now <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-cheers-on-governors-as-they-ignore-white-house-coronovirus-guidelines-in-race-to-reopen/2020/05/04/bedc6116-8e18-11ea-a0bc-4e9ad4866d21_story.html\">shows no problem with states that ignore them</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Some, such as New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, have said the implicit question behind Trump\u2019s decision to dangerously relax physical distancing guidelines and shutdowns is \u201c<a href=\"https://abc7ny.com/coronavirus-new-york-ny-cases-in-news/6153317/\">how much is human life worth</a>?\u201d In a press conference, Cuomo criticized Trump\u2019s plan and asserted human life as \u201cpriceless\u201d.</p> <p>Cuomo\u2019s words, said Colbert, at least offered a \u201crefreshing contrast to Trump\u2019s position: a human life is worth about one trip to Buffalo Wild Wings\u201d.</p> <h2>Jimmy Kimmel</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiUKCHTmSqA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QiUKCHTmSqA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel addressed a personal attack from Trump, who on Tuesday tweeted congratulations to Fox News host Greg Gutfeld for ratings which \u201cbeat no talent Stephen Colbert, nice guy Jimmy Fallon, and wacko \u2018last placer\u2019 Jimmy Kimmel\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI hope he wasn\u2019t talking about me!\u201d Kimmel deadpanned. \u201cI think this may be another typo situation.

  "<p>Sir Frederick Barclay\u2019s nephews sold the Ritz for \u201chalf the market price\u201d after secretly recording conversations between the hotel\u2019s billionaire co-owner and a Saudi investor offering \u00a31.3bn for the London landmark, the high court has heard.</p> <p>Barclay, 85, and his daughter Amanda are suing three of his twin brother Sir David Barclay\u2019s sons - Alistair, Aidan and Howard - and Aidan\u2019s son Andrew over 1,000 conversations secretly recorded over several months.</p> <p>The high court has previously heard that the \u201celaborate system of covert recording\u201d came to light in January when Alistair was filmed on CCTV \u201chandling the bug placed in the conservatory at the Ritz\u201d, where Frederick was known to \u201csmoke a cigar\u201d and hold meetings. </p> <p>At a further preliminary hearing, conducted remotely on Wednesday, Mr Justice Warby heard that the recording of the conversations was \u201ccommercial espionage on a vast scale\u201d.</p> <p>The legal action alleges misuse of private information, breach of confidence and breach of data protection laws.</p> <p>The claimants state in documents that there was a second recording device, a wifi bug, supplied by the <a href=\"https://www.quest.co.uk/people/\">private investigations firm Quest Global</a>, which invoiced for 405 hours of time to listen to and transcribe the recordings. </p> <p>The firm is chaired by the former Metropolitan police commissioner John Stevens, who has conducted inquiries into security breaches in Northern Ireland and the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.</p> <p>The claimants state that among 94 hours of recordings were discussions about an offer for the Ritz hotel for potentially as much as \u00a31.3bn from the Saudi Arabian-based Sidra Capital.</p> <p>The 114-year-old hotel was sold by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4229896f-3dc7-4e7d-b839-c9b62260cd30\">David\u2019s side of the family in March</a> for significantly less, to Abdulhadi Mana al-Hajri, a Qatari businessman who is the brother-in-law of the Gulf state\u2019s rulers, despite a threat from Frederick and Amanda Barclay of <a href=\"https://amp.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/04/sir-frederick-barclay-threatens-sue-twin-ritz-london-hotel\">legal action if it was sold for less than \u00a31bn</a>.</p> <p>Hefin Rees QC, representing Frederick and Amanda, said in a written submission that the defendants heard \u201cSir Frederick\u2019s conversations with Sidra Capital, which at the time had made an initial offer of some \u00a31.3bn for the acquisition of the Ritz hotel\u201d. He added: \u201cDespite this, the defendants sold the Ritz hotel to another buyer from Qatar at a price that appears to be half the market price. One is left to speculate why.\u201d</p> <p>He said material previously disclosed to his clients \u201creveals beyond doubt that the defendants derived significant financial and commercial advantage from the unlawful use of the recordings\u201d. </p> <p>Rees also argued that the recordings allowed the defendants \u201cto anticipate the claimants\u2019 every move in advance, plan their business strategy around that, including knowing what legal advice the claimants were seeking and getting at this crucial time when their business and personal relationships had broken down, and the respective interests of the claimants and the defendants were in conflict\u201d.</p> <p>Financial pressure on the Barclay brothers\u2019 businesses has prompted the sale of the Ritz and potentially other assets including the Telegraph, the delivery business Yodel and the online retailer Very Group (previously known as Shop Direct and before that Littlewoods).</p> <p>In February, private business and family affairs of David and Frederick Barclay were made public in the most dramatic fashion in a high court action following several years of disagreement over the future of their empire.</p> <p>In December David strengthened his family\u2019s grip on the businesses, appointing Aidan and Howard as \u201cpersons with significant control\u201d of Ellerman Holdings, the holding company for the Barclays\u2019 UK assets. Each was given \u201cmore than 25% but not more than 50% of the share ownership and voting rights\u201d.</p> <p>Frederick and David are no longer beneficiaries of the family trust, and Amanda has been left with a 25% share and no power to block David\u2019s side of the family in any big decisions.</p> <p>At the hearing in February, Heather Rogers QC, representing all five defendants, argued there was \u201ca lot of information that would have been in the possession of my clients \u2026 which they have got completely free of the recordings\u201d.</p> <p>She added that her clients had \u201cample opportunity\u201d to \u201cspread it about before an injunction\u201d was granted, but there was \u201cno evidence of dissemination\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>During a pandemic that has seen more than 70,000 deaths in the US (almost a quarter of the global amount), there is probably no worse song the president could walk out to than Live and Let Die, a cover by the rock band Guns N\u2019 Roses.

  "<p>The Home Office has been accused of interfering with the independence of the judiciary after it emerged that judges were asked to provide written explanations for a rise in the number of detainees released from immigration centres during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>In a letter to the president of the Tribunal, Immigration and Asylum Chamber dated 29 April 2020, the Home Office\u2019s head of appeals, James Stevens, wrote: \u201cThe numbers of those in detention have reduced very significantly since the start of this emergency.\u201d He went on to say: \u201cThe Home Office is somewhat surprised at the level of grants of bail in recent weeks.\u201d</p> <p>Official figures record 1,225 people in detention centres on 1 January and 368 at the latest count \u2013 a reduction of almost three-quarters.</p> <p>Stevens outlined the ways in which the Home Office had responded to the risks coronavirus posed to detainees, before adding: \u201cWhere bail is granted I would ask you to consider whether immigration judges could provide written reasons for this.\u201d Judges are not required by law to do this.</p> <p>Stevens wrote: \u201cWhile I realise this is not a requirement under the procedure rules, it would assist the Home Office to fully understand the reasons why bail has been granted.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office is supposed to detain only those it can deport imminently, and its ability to do this has been drastically reduced due to flights being grounded. </p> <p>There have been three confirmed cases of Covid-19 among immigration detainees, and the risk of catching the virus remains high among those who are locked up for extended periods.\ufeff</p> <p>In a response dated 1 May, Michael Clements, the chamber\u2019s president, issued a robust rejection of the Home Office\u2019s request. \u201cAs independent judiciary we decide bail applications in accordance with the law, which includes the guidance which has been issued. There has been no change in either the law or the guidance,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>\u201cThe primary function of detention is accordingly to facilitate removal, and unless there are very powerful reasons to the contrary bail should be granted if there is no removal of the bail applicant within the reasonably foreseeable future.\u201d</p> <p>He said that during the pandemic he had instituted a \u201cminded to grant\u201d bail process, giving the Home Office an early indication before a bail hearing took place that a judge was likely to grant bail unless the Home Office could provide specific reasons why this should not happen.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, the feedback that I am receiving is not only that the Home Office rarely consent to the grant of bail having seen the \u2018minded to grant\u2019 but that bail is still opposed at the hearing without any meaningful additional representations being given.\u201d</p> <p>Pierre Makhlouf, an assistant director at Bail for Immigration Detainees, accused the Home Office of interfering with the judicial approach to bail applications because the rate of successful bail applications had shot up from its usual level of about 30%. He said 55 out of 58 cases where the charity provided representation since lockdown began had been granted bail.</p> <p>Adrian Berry, the chair of the Immigration Law Practitioners\u2019 Association, said: \u201cIt is not appropriate for government to use its position outside of the courtroom to seek to influence decisions. The separation of powers between the government and judiciary is a core constitutional principle.\u201d</p> <p>Bella Sankey, the director of Detention Action, which launched a legal challenge calling for the mass release of detainees during the pandemic, said: \u201cThis letter is a constitutional disgrace, entirely in keeping with a government that thinks it is above the law and not answerable to our sovereign parliament.</p> <p>\u201cThat the Home Office has sought to pressure the immigration tribunal over its bail decisions during a global pandemic shows alarming disrespect for the right to liberty, the rule of law and the separation of powers.\u201d</p> <p>Toufique Hossain, of Duncan Lewis solicitors, who brought the Detention Action case, said: \u201cSeparation of powers is a basic principle of any democratic society to safeguard liberties and guard against tyranny.\u201d</p> <p>\ufeffA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThis is completely untrue, and the Guardian knows full well that this letter is explaining transparently to the judiciary how we are responding to this pandemic, including carefully reviewing the cases of those in detention. The public expects law and order to be maintained, which is why 95% of those currently in detention are foreign-national offenders.\u201d\ufeff</p>",

  "<p>No one has died from not going to an art gallery. Or from missing a night at the theatre, or not seeing a great band. So when people are actually dying it may seem a little churlish to complain that culture feels a little dead. </p> <p>Yet it is flat. The arts establishment seems to me as lumbering, London-centric and out of touch as ever. Just as they had nothing to say about Brexit \u2013 beyond that it was a very bad thing \u2013 what are they telling us about Covid-19?</p> <p>There are various pushes to make sure that, post-pandemic, the big institutions, from the Tate to the V&amp;A, get back to normal. But I don\u2019t want things to get back to normal if that just means rich art collectors jetting round the world to buy paintings as interior design. Is normal when Hollywood figures out how to make crappily scripted films again by checking the temperatures of its actors? Does normal mean stadium tours by big bands with ticket prices in three figures?</p> <p>Already, it is clear that successful artists and institutions are not the ones we need to prioritise. Rather, it is the upcoming generation of culture-makers. We already know what happens when we don\u2019t make it viable for people from every background to enter the arts: art schools have become finishing schools, often for well-heeled international students. The TV industry and theatre are dominated by the connected and wealthy. If social mobility has stalled generally in society, in the arts it has actually gone backwards. A working-class artist is still something to be.</p> <p>This is hardly new, but post-Covid-19 it is our chance to revitalise this monstrously monotone class landscape. Otherwise, we could be left simply with a wasteland.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bd54dd55dc30dc1e123866589484f2fe0f560fb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd54dd55dc30dc1e123866589484f2fe0f560fb4/0_609_2520_2272/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Rothko\" width=\"1000\" height=\"902\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Rothko ... a beneficiary of Roosevelt\u2019s Public Works of Art scheme.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Apic/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We can take lessons from the past. A lot of now-famous artists, from Tracey Emin to Jarvis Cocker, talk of the dole and small enterprise allowance that allowed them to become what they are. In 2009, following the financial crash, some of us were involved in an effort to kickstart our young creatives. Martin Bright had written an inspirational <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/martin-bright/2009/01/deal-work-government-fdr\">article in the New Statesman</a> citing Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal programmes following the Great Depression, when parks, buildings and libraries were built. Roosevelt\u2019s Works Progress Administration created 3,500 libraries and put on 4,400 music performances every month. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jackson-pollock\">Jackson Pollock</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/nov/21/willem-dekooning-mylifeinart-art\">Willem de Kooning</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/rothko\">Mark Rothko</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/saulbellow\">Saul Bellow</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/john-cheever\">John Cheever</a> were some of the beneficiaries of his Public Works of Art scheme.</p> <p>What Bright suggested was a New Deal of the Mind to equip creatives. With the help of Maggie Darling (wife of Alistair), we had a meeting at Downing Street with many key cultural figures of the time. The mistake, I think, was that this was presumed by some to be another begging bowl for arts funding. It was the opposite. We were arguing that a key way out of recession was through cultural projects.</p> <p>In terms of recovery, this should be a no-brainer. Before the crisis struck in February this year, our creative industries contributed almost <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uks-creative-industries-contributes-almost-13-million-to-the-uk-economy-every-hour\">\u00a313m</a><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uks-creative-industries-contributes-almost-13-million-to-the-uk-economy-every-hour\"> to the UK economy every hour</a>. That sector was growing five times faster than the national economy. This is playing to our strengths. We are good at it! As a country, this is our strength, and there are jobs to be created. We were talking about hooking up engineers with arts grads, designers with scientists, tech kids with care homes. Innovation happens in this cross-fertilisation and, post-Covid-19, this is where we need to be.</p> <p>What we also didn\u2019t realise perhaps in 2009 was how fast the digital world was moving and how the gig economy was becoming normalised. Artists need a safety net in this freelance, self-employed world. They also need space no longer possible in city centres. Back then, we asked for commercial empty spaces to be used. Post-Covid, the high street will surely be full of such spaces?</p> <p>Other countries can help show us paths forward. Germany has a federal aid package of \u20ac50bn (\u00a343.6bn), and is distributing it in small chunks \u2013 \u20ac5,000 to freelancers in places like Berlin. Small lump sums to individuals, rather than massive grants to institutions. Initiatives should be local. Textile workshops in Italy are teaching people how to make masks.</p> <p>A thriving culture is not about the next artist to be exhibited at Frieze or the next McQueen. Nor is it about fame or glory. It\u2019s about creating the conditions in which an ecosystem of artistic collaboration may grow. As we hit a global recession, I would argue that culture, far from being a luxury, becomes a necessity. How do we make that culture sustainable? We invest. As Eleanor Roosevelt said: \u201cThe future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.\u201d</p> <p>Now is not the time to lockdown the dreams of our creative young people. Instead, we should make sure they can unlock them.</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br><br></p>",
  "<p>The NHS\u2019s contact-tracing app will fail unless sufficient numbers of Android phone users sign up, experts who have examined its trial use on the Isle of Wight have said.</p> \n<p>They say NHSX, the digital arm of the health service, is relying on an \u201cAndroid herd immunity\u201d strategy to overcome shortcomings in the app. A critical mass of Android users will be required to ensure iPhone owners remain covered by the app\u2019s contact-tracing ability. If not enough Android users are in any given community, iPhones will eventually stop broadcasting the signals required for the app to work.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe workarounds NHSX on both iOS and Android are using to create a centralised database seem to be fragile, disruptive to users and risk apps not registering contacts when they should,\u201d said Michael Veale, a privacy expert at UCL.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"82beeb58-e861-4575-90dd-2b879d1a3a65\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/uk-to-start-coronavirus-contact-tracing-again\">Contact tracing is one of the most basic planks of public health responses to a pandemic</a>&nbsp;like the coronavirus. It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>\n    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>\n    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>\n    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.</p>\n    <p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a>&nbsp;says it should be the \u201cbackbone of the response\u201d in every country.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\"><b>Sarah Boseley</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201ciOS apps are forbidden from using Bluetooth for long after they are minimised. To keep iPhones registering contact events appears to require either the user to constantly remember to reopen and refresh the app or, stranger still, sufficient Android \u2018herd immunity\u2019 among app users, where a nearby user of a non-iPhone, if in range, nudges nearby iPhones to not fall asleep, and to keep listening out.\u201d</p> \n<p>The workaround is required because the NHS took the controversial decision to build a \u201ccentralised\u201d app, which sends data about interactions back to the health service to help with modelling the spread of the disease. As a result, the app cannot use tools built by Apple and Google for the purposes of contact tracing. Those tools, due to be released this month, are restricted to apps that operate in a privacy-first \u201cdecentralised\u201d manner.</p> \n<p>Other countries that have made a similar decision to the UK have faced strict limits to what their contact-tracing apps can do as a result. Singapore, which built the first national contact-tracing app, TraceTogether, had to ask iPhone users to keep the screen turned on and the app open as much as possible in order to ensure their contacts were traceable.</p> \n<p>In Australia, the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/covidsafe-app-is-not-working-properly-on-iphones-authorities-admit?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;CMP=twt_gu&amp;utm_medium&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1588749760\">admitted on Wednesday</a> that its tracker app, COVIDSafe, \u201cprogressively deteriorates\u201d for iPhone users over time.</p> \n<p>The UK\u2019s app is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/guinea-pigs-isle-of-wight-residents-mixed-reactions-to-contact-tracing-app-coronavirus\">being trialled in the Isle of Wight</a>, where it is understood to have been downloaded more than 5,000 times in early release, out of an estimated population of smartphone users of around 100,000 and an overall population of 140,000.</p> \n<p>Sources say they are confident that the proportion of smartphone owners installing the app will exceed 50% after everybody on the island receives a formal invite by letter in the coming days.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Experts from Oxford University have said that the contact-tracing app should be installed by 60% of the population for it to be effective, but those involved believe it will provide useful information about the future spread of the disease with a download rate of 20% \u2013 with the help of the centralised database.</p> \n<p>iPhone\u2019s operating system begins to shut down the UK app\u2019s functions an hour or so after last use, until it ends up in \u201clisten-only\u201d mode. Two phones in that limited mode would be unable to carry out their contact-tracing function.</p> \n<p>As a result, Android phones, which are less aggressive about shutting down unused apps to preserve battery life, will be key to ensuring the contact tracing works. They will \u201cwake up\u201d nearby iPhones, ensuring that the contact tracing works.</p> \n<p>If even that does not occur, the app has a second fallback, sending a push notification to users asking them to reopen the application, in effect restarting the clock.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b768d0a9-0396-458b-be59-8c1f042adefe\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>On 18 May, Matt Hancock announced coronavirus testing is being extended in the UK to anyone over the age of five with symptoms.</p>\n    <p>Before then,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-getting-tested\">eligibility had been limited</a>&nbsp;to a series of groups including key workers, those aged over 65, people who could not work from home, or people who lived with someone from one of these groups.</p>\n    <p>Those with symptoms can now&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-getting-tested\">use the gov.uk website to book</a> home test kits or appointments at drive-through centres across the country.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Jason Kneen, <a href=\"https://www.bouncingfish.com\">a freelance app developer</a>, says the workarounds mean the app should have a higher chance of success than those in other nations.

  "<p>An anti-abortion campaigner who is banned from displaying a poster featuring an image of a dead foetus alongside a picture of the Labour MP Stella Creasy has failed to overturn a council order against him.</p> <p>Christian Hacking challenged the imposition of a community protection notice (CPN) after he put up the image of what he said was a \u201c24-week-old aborted baby girl\u201d in Creasy\u2019s constituency in Walthamstow, north-east London.</p> <p>Creasy, 43, was pregnant at the time. She has been a vocal supporter of women\u2019s right to choose and led a successful campaign last year to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/09/mps-vote-to-extend-same-sex-marriage-to-northern-ireland\">extend abortion to Northern Ireland</a>.</p> <p>Hacking, 29, from nearby Hackney, said the display of the bloody image was part of a \u201cStopStella\u201d event last October. At a two-day hearing in February, he argued that the community protection notice ban imposed by Waltham Forest borough council was illegal.</p> <p>He urged the court to reconsider the matter on human rights grounds, comparing the emotional impact of the display to that of images of three-year-old Alan Kurdi, whose lifeless body was pictured in news stories around the world highlighting the Syrian refugee crisis in 2015.</p> <p>Hacking told the hearing \u201cThe whole business of what we do is exposing the reality of abortion to members of the public who don\u2019t know what abortion looks like. Generally speaking, we know that the public are misinformed by what abortion procedures entail.\u201d</p> <p>Hacking, from the campaign group Centre for Bio-ethical Reform UK, said the 10ft x 10ft (3-metre x 3-metre) poster was designed to educate the public about abortion.</p> <p>At Thames magistrates court on Wednesday, the district judge Jonathan Radway dismissed the appeal during a two-minute hearing.</p> <p>In his written decision, he said: \u201cI find a prolonged static display, intended to last a couple of hours in the busy middle of the day, unavoidable to those entering the town square, of a deeply disturbing image which caused harm to some observers, is beyond the margin of what freedom of expression requires, even for political speech.</p> <p>\u201cWas the CPN a proportionate response to the situation? After anxious consideration, I have concluded it was.\u201d</p> <p>Radway said his ruling was \u201cnot about the rights and wrongs of abortion\u201d.</p> <p>Creasy has previously told MPs how she felt \u201charassed\u201d by the campaign and sought police assistance.</p> <p>During the February hearing, one local resident told the court she felt \u201ctruly sick in her stomach\u201d on seeing the image, and had \u201cbeen left feeling anxious and nervous when approaching the location in town\u201d.</p> <p>Neither Hacking nor Creasy was present in court for the hearing on Wednesday.</p> <p>Hacking and his supporters said they would appeal against the judgment.</p> <p>Andrea Williams, the chief executive of the Christian Legal Centre, which is supporting the case, said: \u201cThe ruling hinges on the idea that this image, showing the tragic reality of abortion, causes significant and lasting emotional harm.</p> <p>\u201cBut however uncomfortable the truth, we must be free to make these distressing realities known, or the vastly more horrific truth of abortion becomes immune to criticism.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a high bar to restricting free speech. Freedom of speech must include, and has been ruled in law to include, that which is shocking, provocative and offensive. Political campaigns are often shocking and disturbing.\u201d</p> <p>Hacking said: \u201cI am deeply disappointed that our appeal to show the reality of abortion to the people of Waltham Forest has not been successful. The real victim of abortion is not MP Stella Creasy, or those negatively impacted by its visualisation, but the unborn child.</p> <p><em>\u201c</em>How can we see positive change in the UK if politicians and councils are allowed to dictate how we express peaceable opinions in public? For the sake of the unborn and for freedom of speech, we must take this appeal further and hold those authorities to account.\u201d</p> <p>Clare Coghill, the leader of Waltham Forest council, said: \u201cWe are glad that the court has agreed that our actions to protect residents of Waltham Forest against gratuitously offensive imagery being displayed in Walthamstow town centre were proportionate. We acted after receiving numerous complaints from members of the public about these images.</p> <p>\u201cWe fundamentally believe in free speech and the right to protest. However, we also believe that those who live, work, and study in the borough have the right to use their town centre without being aggressively confronted with deliberately provocative material.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>The World Health Organization lists the most common symptoms of Covid-19 as fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Others include a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion, pain, diarrhoea and the loss of sense of taste and/or smell. But there are also other more unusual symptoms that patients have presented.</p> \n<h2>\u2018Covid toe\u2019</h2> \n<p>Patients in several countries have reported rashes on their toes, resembling chilblains, in many cases unaccompanied by any of the usual symptoms of the virus. The condition has been dubbed \u201cCovid toe\u201d. The rashes can take the form of red or purple lesions and, despite the name, can be found on the side or sole of the foot, or even on hands and fingers. <a href=\"https://www.ejpd.com/images/nuova-vasculite-covid-ENG.pdf\">The European Journal of Ped</a><a href=\"https://www.ejpd.com/images/nuova-vasculite-covid-ENG.pdf\">iatric Dermatology</a> reported an \u201cepidemic\u201d of cases among children and adolescents in Italy. It said that unlike other rashes associated with coronavirus, it had not been previously observed.</p> \n<h2>Conjunctivitis/pink eye</h2> \n<p>Conjunctivitis has been a rare symptom in cases of Covid-19, with viral particles being found in tears. In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.college-optometrists.org/the-college/media-hub/news-listing/viral-conjunctivitis-and-covid-19.html\">the Royal College of Ophthalmologists and College of Optometrists says</a>: \u201cIt is recognised that any upper respiratory tract infection may result in viral conjunctivitis as a secondary complication, and this is also the case with Covid-19. However, it is unlikely that a person would present with viral conjunctivitis secondary to Covid-19 without other symptoms of fever or a continuous cough as conjunctivitis seems to be a late feature where is has occurred.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Livedo or necrosis</h2> \n<p>A peer-reviewed Spanish study, <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjd.19163\">published in the British Journal of Dermatology last week</a>, found that 6% of the 375 coronavirus cases examined involved necrosis, the death of body tissue due to a lack of blood supply, or livedo, discolouration of the skin. The skin can become mottled and have purple or red patchy areas, which may appear in a lace-like pattern. In the study, it was generally found in older patients with more severe cases of Covid-19. However, this was not consistent across the board and necrosis was also found in some people with coronavirus who did not require hospitalisation.</p> \n<h2><strong>Dizziness/</strong><strong>headaches</strong></h2> \n<p>A study of 214 patients in China, <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2764549\">published in Jama Neurology last month</a>, found that just over a third (36.4%) had experienced neurological symptoms such as dizziness or headaches, increasing to 45.5% in those with severe coronavirus infections. Commenting on the research, Prof Ian Jones, professor of virology at the University of Reading, said: \u201cIt happens, but is generally not what coronaviruses do. At the moment neurological complications might best be considered a consequence of Covid-19 disease severity rather than a distinct new concern.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Tingling/</strong><strong>fizzing sensation</strong></h2> \n<p>Some patients have complained about a tingling, fizzing or even burning sensation.

He said: \u201cThere\u2019s a widespread immune response that is happening. Our immune cells get activated so a lot of chemicals get released throughout our body and that can present or feel like there\u2019s some fizzing.

  "<p>The novel virus first emerged in east Asia. By spring, a pandemic suffuses the globe. In America, businesses shut down, airports empty, misinformation abounds. The president, a divisive figure with a tanning bed in the White House, offers baseless reassurances, and appoints the dubiously pious vice-president to lead the pandemic response. This would be a decent summary of the past two months, if it wasn\u2019t the plot to The End of October, a new novel by Lawrence Wright, which flies thrillingly, eerily close to reality \u2013 a global outbreak of a deadly pathogen with no known cure in the kinetic, flammable information torrent of the late 2010s.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/21/lawrence-wright-god-save-texas-journey-future-america-interview-looming-tower-911\">Lawrence Wright: \u2018It\u2019s difficult to escape the Texas stereotype\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s unnerving\u201d Wright, a New Yorker staff writer and Pulitzer-winning journalist, told the Guardian on the surreal fortune of releasing a global pandemic novel during a global pandemic. \u201cIt was meant to be a warning cry, when we weren\u2019t buffeted by all this dire news. Whenever I open the paper it feels like I\u2019m reading my own book. It\u2019s weird.\u201d The End of October, which Lawrence began writing in 2017 (his final draft was submitted in summer 2019), is a deeply researched scenario-play of a novel \u2013 the world faced with a 1918 Spanish flu-type pathogen \u2013 told in brisk, unsparing prose. Competence and expertise serve as its compass; Wright\u2019s American protagonist, Dr Henry Parsons, is a cunning, emotionally clamped virologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), outrunning a shady past at a secret lab in Maryland\u2019s Fort Detrick.</p> <p>Alarmed by a mass die-off in an Indonesian political concentration camp for young gay men, Henry travels to Jakarta, where he discovers \u201cKongoli virus\u201d, named after the camp, a gruesome new form of hemorrhagic influenza. Wright\u2019s writing is clinical and unblinking \u2013 you stare into chest cavities, at lungs subsumed in fluid, at bodies turned blue by cyanosis, or lack of oxygen. The Kongoli camp is quarantined and swarmed by various health agencies that are, like Henry, veterans of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in west Africa. But when an inadvertently exposed taxi driver makes the hajj \u2013 the Islamic holy pilgrimage to Mecca \u2013 along with 3 million other people, all bets for containing the spread are off. Within days, people die en masse around the world.</p> <p>The idea for a modern pandemic story originated in 2010, when film-maker Ridley Scott approached Wright to write a screenplay about the end of civilization. \u201cIn my mind, the more likely way civilization would be threatened like that would be a pandemic,\u201d said Wright, who long admired the \u201creally creative, intelligent\u201d epidemiologists, microbiologists and virologists he encountered as a journalist. Though they never made the movie, \u201cI was always interested and I thought it was a really good story,\u201d he said. \u201cI decided that if I was going to do it, I would have to do the research I had failed to do when I was working on it as a script.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e624aa909af4c04fc5f3d3e02785d95cf84b245\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e624aa909af4c04fc5f3d3e02785d95cf84b245/0_0_3000_2274/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"758\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Wright, known for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/books/scientology-fascinates-the-author-lawrence-wright.html\">incredibly thorough</a> research in his non-fiction work, took a journalistic approach to researching the novel \u2013 reading as much as possible, contacting experts (the acknowledgments cite leading experts from the NIH, Columbia and Pfizer, among others). His sources were \u201cthe same guys who are developing a vaccine \u2013 they\u2019re the best minds around\u201d and helped Wright contort his way out of a medical puzzle he\u2019d written into the novel\u2019s second half, when pandemic-stranded Henry is trying to get home to his family in Atlanta. They also color the novel with rich and accessible scientific detail on viruses, bioweapons and past pandemics.</p> <p>Wright primarily based the Kongoli virus on the 1918 Spanish flu, which also arrived in the US in the spring, lulled in the summer, and returned with a deadlier second wave in the fall. The title The End of October pays tribute to arguably the <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/spanish-flu-deaths-october-1918\">most mortal month in American history</a>, in which 195,000 people died. \u201cThe question I was asking my experts was: what would happen if something like the 1918 flu appeared in our civilization?\u201d Wright said. \u201cWould we be any better prepared than our ancestors? It\u2019s not clear what the answer is.\u201d</p> <p>The fictional Kongoli virus is, however, far more lethal than Covid-19, with a mortality rate closer to previous coronaviruses <a href=\"https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2003/05/estimates-sars-death-rates-revised-upward\">S</a><a href=\"https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2003/05/estimates-sars-death-rates-revised-upward\">ars (15%) </a>and <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/\">M</a><a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/\">ers (about 35%)</a>. The End of October plunges beyond the relative chaos of the current moment into full societal breakdown \u2013 the government in bunkers, schools looted, ATMs empty of cash. Millions die in the US, including celebrities like Taylor Swift. Blood drips from the president\u2019s eye on national television; one character searches the radio and finds only conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.</p> <p>In writing Kongoli\u2019s geopolitical fallout \u2013 Russia escalates cyberwarfare and tensions boil over in the Gulf \u2013 Wright worked in expertise honed in his previous non-fiction books on conflict in the Middle East (Thirteen Days in September), religious fanaticism (Going Clear, an expos\u00e9 on Scientology turned into a 2015 HBO documentary) and the War on Terror (The Looming Tower, on al-Qaida\u2019s road to 9/11, which earned him a Pulitzer prize in 2007). \u201cI looked at the antagonisms, the rivalries, and I just imagined if you add stress \u2013 a pandemic \u2013 then what would happen?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty dismaying to watch the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/donald-trump-coronavirus-chinese-lab-claim\">blame game</a> going on right now and seeing that governments are behaving pretty much as expected.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f294c5732f2eac6c9f33e245356e76523d3d9223\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f294c5732f2eac6c9f33e245356e76523d3d9223/0_0_4287_2854/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeff Daniels and Tahar Rahim in The Looming Tower\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeff Daniels and Tahar Rahim in The Looming Tower.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JoJo Whilden/BBC/Hulu/JoJo Whilden</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though (as of now) much more apocalyptic than the present, Wright\u2019s book anticipates several elements of the Covid pandemic: <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/what-anti-asian-attacks-say-about-american-culture-during-crisis\">hate crimes against the minority group</a> blamed for the virus (in the novel\u2019s case, Muslims). <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/us-healthcare-workers-make-gut-wrenching-decisions-coronavirus\">Ventilator shortages</a>. Empty, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster\">flailing attempts at reassurance</a> from the administration. But he, like many public health experts, did not anticipate a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/how-will-coronavirus-end/608719/\">breakdown in testing</a>. \u201cI was horrified,\u201d said Wright of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-testing-us\">testing debacle</a>. \u201cAnd saddened, because the CDC in my experience had always been one of the glittering prizes of American government, something you could always rely upon \u2013 their expertise, their competence, their authority. And to see them stumble so badly, it\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d</p> <p>He also didn\u2019t anticipate one hopeful development of this pandemic: \u201cthe solidarity of individual citizens to isolate themselves at enormous personal costs, social costs, spiritual costs, financial costs\u201d.</p> <p>There\u2019s a compulsive thrill to reading a book which grazes, and then runs off with, our increasingly ungraspable reality, but Wright is careful not to tout his writing as prescient. \u201cI made some lucky guesses, but for the most part, what people are reading as prophecy is just what experts told me would happen,\u201d he said. Expertise, briefing books, scenario exercises \u2013 \u201call of that stuff was on the table. It was there for anybody who was interested, and I was interested.\u201d</p> <p>As for how he imagines a new normal, \u201cI think we\u2019re at a crossroads,\u201d he said. \u201cWar or depression or pandemic gives you a kind of X-ray vision about the society you live in, and you see it for what it is \u2013 its shortcomings, its strengths. And I think the shortcomings are plainly apparent: the partisanship, the needless international antagonisms, the lack of preparation, the disrespect for science, all of those things are creating havoc that we shouldn\u2019t have to deal with.\u201d</p> <p>And while Wright understands people might have pandemic reading fatigue \u2013 \u201cThere are going to be a lot of people who aren\u2019t emotionally ready to read this book,\u201d he conceded \u2013 he hopes people leave the End of October with a \u201cclearer understanding of disease and contagion and the dangers of pandemics, and also be impressed, as I am, by the courage and ingenuity of the people who are fighting disease. That\u2019s why the book is dedicated to them.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>The End of October is out now</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>The debate over holding a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-above-32000-to-highest-in-europe\">public inquiry</a> into the British government\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 crisis resembles the way we talked about the virus when it remained confined to Wuhan: most people agree that it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/27/public-inquiry-coronavirus\">coming</a>; few are willing to discuss what it will look like.</p> <p>This may, in part, be due to an understandable reluctance to point fingers or apportion blame before the storm has passed, while hundreds of people are still dying every day from the virus. But it is far from being an unseemly subject that it is too early to discuss: public confidence will be enhanced by an open discussion about the scope of an inquiry. The results of any such inquiry cannot come too soon, not just to answer the urgent questions of bereaved families across the country, but also to help head off the worst impacts of future pandemics \u2013 possibly even a second or third wave of the current virus.</p> <p>Unless a statutory inquiry is established now (perhaps along the lines of the ongoing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/grenfell-tower-inquiry\">inquiry into the fire at Grenfell Tower</a>), there is a risk some evidence will not be preserved, and those with facts to hide will have the opportunity to lead us away from a judge-led inquiry towards something far less independent and rigorous, or to hive off certain areas frompublic scrutiny.</p> <p>There are many forms of fact finding, with inquests being the obvious forum for determining the facts of deaths, especially unnatural deaths and those in state custody. But the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/7/contents/enacted\">Coronavirus Act 2020</a> amendments to coronial law and recent chief coroner guidance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/29/inquests-nhs-staff-deaths-ppe-shortages\">some of it highly controversial</a>, aim to severely reduce the use of inquest juries and the scope of inquests, where they are held at all. In any event, it is unrealistic to ask under-resourced coroners up and down the country to unpick the potentially complex web of systemic contributory factors that led to each individual Covid-19 death and ensure consistent, fast learning. This is exacerbated by the sheer scale of these simultaneous deaths around the country.</p> <p>Central government has numerous alternative fact-finding methods. It could establish one or more royal commissions, civil service reviews or parliamentary select committee investigations. Any one of these alone or in combination would result in some scrutiny of the facts and how the crisis has been handled, but none has anything close to the political independence of an inquiry held under the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/12/contents\">Inquiries Act 2005</a>. Nor do they possess the same powers of compulsion relating to key documents and witnesses.</p> <p>It is noticeable that Dominic Raab, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/22/covid-19-starmer-grills-raab-over-care-home-deaths-in-first-virtual-pmqs\">standing in</a> for Boris Johnson at prime minister\u2019s questions on 22 April, explicitly declined Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey\u2019s offer to commit to a public inquiry. This might indicate that Johnson\u2019s government would look to establish smaller investigations into discrete aspects of the Covid-19 crisis and then use this to argue that a fullblown public inquiry was either no longer necessary, or should not stray into the areas already covered by these less robust forms of investigation.</p> <p>Covid-19 is having a devastating effect on many different areas of our lives. The loss of life has been so extensive, and the social and economic damage so widespread, that one of the primary challenges for any inquiry would be to determine which of the numerous issues to examine. The <a href=\"https://www.grenfelltowerinquiry.org.uk/\">Grenfell Tower</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/independent-panel-inquiry-into-child-sexual-abuse\">child </a><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/independent-panel-inquiry-into-child-sexual-abuse\">abuse </a><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/independent-panel-inquiry-into-child-sexual-abuse\">inquiries</a> provide valuable lessons in managing just such wide-ranging fact-finding exercises, though the Covid-19 inquiry would have to find its own solutions to what would be an unprecedented task.</p> <p>For example, phase one of the Grenfell inquiry focused on the night of the fire. One can imagine something similar for Covid-19, in which the scientific advice given to government and the decisions made by it are tracked, hour-by-hour. This initial phase could also include other basic fact-finding, such as the number of deaths actually caused by, or directly related to, the virus.</p> <p>Phase two of the Grenfell inquiry is split into eight \u201cmodules\u201d, each of which covers a different aspect of the disaster, such as the tower\u2019s refurbishment, the cladding, firefighting and response by government and other public bodies to previous incidents. Again, one can imagine similar for Covid-19, with each module tackling a different problem or priority area, such as the provision of PPE and the rollout of test and trace. Urgent recommendations could be issued as soon as some areas were addressed, and reforms implemented without delay.</p> <p>A common criticism of public inquiries is that they are expensive, and the recommendations they make are often ignored. In this case, a properly managed inquiry could actually save public money, because \u2013 as with Grenfell \u2013 it could replace the need for thousands of individual coronial inquests. Meanwhile, what are the costs of failing to learn the full lessons of this pandemic? Politicians are free to ignore recommendations, but they are much less likely to if the body making them has widespread public support, and is seen to be acting independently in society\u2019s best interests.</p> <p>The Covid-19 crisis poses powerful challenges to almost every aspect of our society. It forms precisely the kind of overarching threat that necessitates clear-eyed analysis in order to prevent the same happening again.</p> <p>A public inquiry is by far the best way to achieve this. The announcement of the inquiry is already overdue: what is also now needed is an urgent discussion with key interest groups on how it will work. The scope of the inquiry must be finalised<strong> </strong> in a way that will command public confidence and ensure all relevant facts are brought to light, identifying those responsible for any failings. Most importantly, a public inquiry must enable fast learning, aimed at preventing further loss of life, misery and economic catastrophe.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Daniel Machover is head of civil litigation at Hickman &amp; Rose solicitors</p>",

An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/fearful-britons-oppose-lifting-lockdown-schools-pubs-restaurants-opinium-poll\">Observer poll</a> at the weekend found that the majority of people believe it\u2019s too soon to ease restrictions, and local people are understandably furious<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/lake-district-coronavirus-lockdown-north-east-second-wave-risk\"> </a>with those do flout the current rules, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/lake-district-coronavirus-lockdown-north-east-second-wave-risk\">as happened this week in the Lake District</a>.</p> <p>The challenge for destinations is giving tourism the shot in the arm that it desperately needs while reassuring visitors, employees and residents that they will be safe. As a result of that delicate balancing act, holidaying in the UK this summer may well feel like we\u2019ve time-travelled back to the 1950s, before the advent of affordable foreign travel: there will be day trips to beaches, parks and gardens; we\u2019ll be able to buy an ice-cream but won\u2019t be dining in a crowded restaurant; if it rains we won\u2019t be sheltering in the nearest museum or indoor activity centre.</p> <p>Outdoor spaces in rural and coastal areas and attractions with large grounds will be the first to welcome visitors, not just because those are places where social distancing can be maintained but because, post-lockdown, people will be drawn to nature for its calming effects. \u201cConsumer research shows that people want to get back to simple pleasures,\u201d said Kate Mavor, chief executive of English Heritage, which manages 400 historic sites in England. \u201cPeople can come with a picnic and just enjoy being close to nature. There\u2019s also great comfort in being in places that have stood the sense of time \u2013 that have survived war and pestilence. We will be a tonic for people when they come.\u201d</p> <p>But even simple pleasures will be different post-lockdown. Pre-booking visits to heritage sites will become the new norm. One-way systems, extra signage, hand sanitiser stations and staff in PPE will be familiar sights as attractions strive to minimise risk to visitors and staff.</p> <p>\u201cThe challenge even with open spaces will be around security and making sure people are being sensible,\u201d said Deirdre Wells, chief executive of Visit Kent and Hertfordshire. \u201cWhat people were used to beforehand will not happen now: just turning up at a National Trust place may not be possible.\u201d</p> <p>This first phase of openings will be closely watched by tourist boards aware that recovery is dependent on the confidence of local communities. \u201cIf local people see that these attractions are acting responsibly, you\u2019re warming them up to the idea of more visitors coming back by late summer and autumn,\u201d said Jo Dilley of Marketing Peak District.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97b70518f33382e6eac36cad75970d811672c97d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97b70518f33382e6eac36cad75970d811672c97d/0_8_4272_2564/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cosy wooden cottage by a stream in Snowdonia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Self-catering cottages like this one in Snowdonia, may be able to open before hotels.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: pr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Riddell Graham of Visit Scotland added: \u201cWe had a not particularly helpful situation early on when people were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/scottish-government-furious-at-travellers-to-highlands-and-islands\">trying to get to islands to self-isolate</a>. So no matter what we do, we have to take on board the community interest, particularly for more remote rural areas.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time as reassuring communities that their safety is a priority, tourism officials will be pushing the value of visitors to the local economy. The impact of coronavirus on the 241,000 tourism businesses in the UK has been catastrophic. \u201cYou can\u2019t underestimate how important the visitor economy is for an area like ours,\u201d said Haigh of Cumbria Tourism. \u201cIf tourism isn\u2019t allowed to return \u2013 and if the value of that tourism isn\u2019t created, a lot of businesses won\u2019t be here this time next year.\u201d</p> <p>Of course the economic impact hasn\u2019t just been on businesses. Financial pressures on individuals will affect the recovery. Greg Stevenson, founder of cottage company <a href=\"https://www.underthethatch.co.uk/\">Under the Thatch</a>, said the company is receiving daily bookings for July and August \u2013 but mainly for more expensive properties. \u201cIt\u2019s wealthier people who are booking five-star cottages.\u201d</p> <p>Stevenson, who lives in Ireland, believes Johnson\u2019s roadmap announcement will boost public confidence. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it in Ireland, where there\u2019s a massive difference in public feeling [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/ireland-extends-covid-19-lockdown-to-18-may-before-phased-exit\">since a five-stage exit from lockdown was announced on 2 May</a>]. I think people in the UK will be much less panicky about the situation after Sunday.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People come for the social aspect \u2013 to hear the buzz of people in the bar. If that doesn\u2019t exist it will be strange</p> <footer> <cite>Robin Hutson, hotelier</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He believes self-catering properties will be in the second tranche of openings. New procedures will be put in place, such as sterilising hard surfaces and providing antiseptic sprays, but he is sure there\u2019s an appetite for holidays this summer. \u201cI\u2019ve got no doubt at all that there is demand for people to get away tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>The owner of campground <a href=\"https://thequietsite.co.uk/\">The Quiet Site</a> in Ullswater agrees that an appetite for travel will return relatively swiftly. \u201cIn Denmark, which was the first European country to ease lockdown, demand is at 90% compared with last year. There won\u2019t be a rush to travel but it will come back,\u201d said Daniel Holder. He is anticipating welcoming campers and caravanners back to his site this summer although the onsite bar, shop and check-in will come later. But part-opening will take its toll. \u201cIt will be hard to reach a break-even point this season.\u201d</p> <p> Hotels, restaurants and bars also fear that opening halfway through the season with reduced capacity due to social distancing will be fatal to certain businesses unless the government extends its financial support. In an open letter to Johnson this week, Robin Hutson, chief executive of Homegrown Hotels, which operates six <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/aug/20/the-pig-at-combe-honiton-devon-hotel-review\">Pig hotels</a> and the Lime Wood Hotel in the New Forest, wrote: \u201cThe worst possible scenario for rural hospitality would be the \u2018perfect storm\u2019 of furlough ceasing, hospitality opening up, but social distancing rules imposed \u2026 This toxic recipe would immediately translate to mass redundancies and the permanent loss of hundreds of thousands of rural jobs. This would be economically and socially devastating for rural Britain.\u201d</p> <p>The letter, supported by many of the biggest names in the food and hotel trades, including Rick Stein, Mitch Tonks, Michael Caines and Gordon Campbell-Gray, called for a flexible, part-time furlough scheme until the end of the first quarter of 2021 and an extension of the business rates holiday until the second quarter. He is optimistic that hospitality will be considered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/rishi-sunak-preparing-to-wind-down-furlough-scheme-from-july\">when the Treasury announces details of the scaled-back scheme.</a></p> <p>Like hoteliers across the country, Hutson and his team are drawing up plans for post-lockdown operating. Measures being discussed include meeting guests at their car instead of at reception, express checkouts, two-hour slots for room cleaning, and even decorative screening between tables. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent hours talking about what we\u2019re going to do but without knowing the ground rules,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s terribly difficult to formulate a plan.\u201d</p> <p>Such measures will reassure potential visitors, especially when a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/uk-tourism-sector-to-flag-attractions-with-physical-distancing-measures\">nationwide kite mark showing that businesses are complying with new guidelines</a> comes into place, but Hutson fears they\u2019ll also make the atmosphere strained: \u201cPeople come to us for the social aspect \u2013 to hear the buzz of other people in the bar. That\u2019s part of what we sell and if it doesn\u2019t exist it\u2019s going to be strange. The little bit of hope for our industry is that we will probably be among the last to be \u2018released\u2019. By then the population may have gained some confidence in moving around - that could help the mindset.\u201d </p> <p>Despite Hutson\u2019s fears for rural Britain, recovery will start sooner than in cities. Galleries, museums and other indoor attractions will be in the final tranche of openings in late summer or early autumn, although tourism officials hope to see some life return to cities if planning restrictions are relaxed to allow restaurants and bars to expand on to the streets. \u201cIn Sweden they have closed down streets and made them into dining and drinking areas in the evenings to increase floor space and bring food outside,\u201d said Kurt Janson, director of Tourism Alliance, a consortium of 55 trade bodies in tourism and hospitality. \u201cThis summer we might look more continental.\u201d</p> <p>In the meantime, as the nation prepares to spend another bank holiday at home, destinations are sticking to the same message: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ndevoncouncil?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1257959404256866305&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2020%2Fmay%2F06%2Fuk-tourism-sector-to-flag-attractions-with-physical-distancing-measures\">stay away this VE day and come back later. </a><br></p>",
  "<p>The UK cinema industry is understood to be lobbying the government to approve a proposed reopening scheme that would see venues welcome customers by the end of June.</p> <p>Phil Clapp, the chief executive of the UK Cinema Association said: \u201cWe\u2019ve made representations to government on the safeguards which UK cinemas would look to have in place for audiences and staff alike upon re-opening, and have asked that consideration be given \u2013 with these in mind \u2013 to allow cinemas to open by the end of June.\u201d</p> <p>Clapp\u2019s plan is in line with the optimism of Vue Cinemas\u2019 chief executive Tim Richards, who yesterday <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52542693\">told the BBC</a> he was hopeful that his chain would be up and running before the 17 July release of Christopher Nolan\u2019s Tenet, one of the remaining tentpole blockbusters whose release has not been delayed by the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we are trying to do is work with the government to demonstrate that we are not like sporting fixtures or music concerts,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52542693\">said Richards</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe can actually control how many people go into our cinema at any given time. We have the ability to schedule our films separately and we have the ability to control entrances and exits for customers.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdOM0x0XDMo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LdOM0x0XDMo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Clapp remains cagey on the nature of proposed safety measures , but it is anticipated that seating capacity caps will be compulsory, as well as staggered screening times, contactless ticketing transactions and enhanced hygiene measures, such as more frequent venue-cleaning and widespread sanitisation stations.</p> <p>Yesterday, Kristian Connelly, the CEO of Australian chain Cinema Nova, confirmed they too were banking on Tenet galvanising business once cinemas reopening, calling the film \u201ca totem guiding the industry towards its reboot.\u201d</p> <p>A high-concept sci-fi thriller starring Robert Pattinson and John David Washington, Tenet follows a secret agent who travels through time in an attempt to prevent the third world war. The film, which has a budget of over $200m, was expressly designed for the big screen and shot in Imax, 35mm and 70mm.</p> <p>Nolan has long been a champion of the theatrical experience and sources suggest the film-maker himself may be behind the risky move to make Tenet a canary down the mine in the new cinema landscape.</p> <p>The CEO of Imax, Richard Gelfond, told <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/news/imax-earnings-coronavirus-tenet-1234594049/\">Variety</a>, \u201cChris really would like to be coming out with a film that opens in theatres. I don\u2019t know anyone in America who is pushing harder to get the theatres reopened and to get his movie released than Chris Nolan.\u201d</p> <p>If the studio succeeds in turning a profit from the strategy, it will need public confidence to be high enough for them to venture out, and competitors to remain sufficiently nervous that Tenet is the sole major title playing in most cinemas \u2013 which will be operating at far short of full capacity \u2013 for many weeks.</p> <p>At the present time, only Disney have another major title on the books for July: the long-delayed live-action remake of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK8FHdFluOQ\">Mulan</a>, scheduled for release a week after Tenet.</p> <p>Last week, plans were unveiled for cinemas in the Czech Republic and Norway to reopen later in May.

It is thought to be unlikely a simultaneous online release for such a title would be pursued, as the profit margins for such a release \u2013 as well as its substantial sponsorship campaigns \u2013 would require the maximum possible theatrical footfall.</p> <p>Some sources suggest that Universal may consider a fresh postponement of the release to next year, further suggesting the studio remains committed to cinema releasing.</p> <p>That film\u2019s current release date in the US falls over the Thanksgiving weekend, a traditionally lucrative spot in the calendar, which other studios will be eyeing should No Time to Die move. Earlier this week, Paramount Pictures announced a Christmas release for Top Gun: Maverick, which sees a belated return for Tom Cruise\u2019s flying ace.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5bd997a7dbe64d086c77b1dd8ca5bb4328ca7922\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bd997a7dbe64d086c77b1dd8ca5bb4328ca7922/26_0_817_490/500.jpg\" alt=\"Maximum footfall needed \u2026 No Time to Die\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maximum footfall needed \u2026 No Time to Die</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The studio also announced an early September spot for A Quiet Place 2, which was pulled from the schedules just before its mid-March debut. This echoes the eagerness of exhibitors for an early end to cinema closures, while also allowing for the option of a digitally led campaign.</p> <p>The film, which stars Emily Blunt as the head of a family self-isolating to try and protect themselves against a global threat, would likely follow in the footsteps of Bird Box, Netflix\u2019s similarly themed hit starring Sandra Bullock, which was seen by 45m accounts in its first seven days of release in late 2018.</p> <p>A Quiet Place 2 \u2013 which relies on long periods of near silence punctuated by abrupt and loud moments of shock \u2013 is also a film ideally suited to the drive-in, which has seen a dramatic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/may/05/social-distance-cinema-drive-in-theatres-boom-coronavirus-in-pictures\">upturn in popularity</a> since the start of the pandemic.</p> <p>While studios have been relatively swift to announce plans for tentpole titles, release strategies for smaller-scale dramas \u2013 thrown off course by both the closure of cinemas and uncertainty over the future of the film festivals where many of them would have begun their journey \u2013 mostly remain murky.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/14/cannes-film-festival-says-2020-edition-cannot-go-ahead-in-original-form\">Cannes </a>and Venice film festivals have still to officially declare whether this year\u2019s editions will be cancelled; that news will likely determine the fates of films vying for next year\u2019s awards.</p> <p>Yet the announcement last week by the Academy of Motion Pictures and Sciences that the 2021 Oscars would, for one year only, extend its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/28/academy-awards-oscars-streaming-films-coronavirus\">eligibility criteria</a> to films that had not debuted in cinemas is likely to serve as a considerable reassurance to companies sitting on prestige cinema.</p> <p>It may also be an incentive: if some studios still choose to hold titles back in the hope of maximum theatrical profit, smaller outfits could reap the benefits both in terms of digital revenue and awards acclaim.</p>",

Whilst I have gathered robust evidence for two decades proving that whistleblowing compliance policies always have [been] and always will be entirely ineffective in protecting whistleblowers, the Covid-19 crisis has laid bare the true cost of compliance-friendly whistleblowing law. That cost is avoidable loss of life and suffering on a scale that is unprecedented.\u201d</p> \n<p>She adds: \u201cThe working conditions of staff are horrendous, the toll on physical and mental health is massive. The fear that is involved in going into work every day with little or all too often no PPE at all is corrosive on health and trust.\u201d</p> \n<p>The report includes comments from care workers who contacted the helpline, whose identities have been anonymised for their protection. One said: \u201cThere are no nurses here. We have to look after people. People are distressed, they cannot get enough air. It\u2019s just awful. We do not have the time to hold their hand. I loved working here but I hate it now, I am ashamed of the care when I used to be proud of it. They do not listen to us staff.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another whistleblower said: \u201cThe first few days I think we were all running on adrenaline. Then people got sick. I do not know what I expected but not this. These people need nursing, they need to be in hospital. We are looking after people with no PPE. We only have gloves and they are running out.</p> \n<p>\u201cI thought this company was alright until I whistleblew. They said I was letting the team down moaning about this; they told all the other staff I was complaining about them. That\u2019s not true.

That\u2019s not medical care. The people who are sick are really suffering. They can\u2019t take a drink, they need to be on a drip, they are so thirsty, and they need help to breathe. This is like a war zone in here. They need to be in hospital. I keep reporting this but am told leave it alone. Yes, people have died from lack of medical care.

I know the fate of people who have courage and integrity.

Key environment officials have been sacked, and environmentalists and indigenous leaders fear the pandemic is being used as a smokescreen for a new assault on the rainforest.</p> <p>They say a presidential <a href=\"http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2019-2022/2019/Mpv/mpv910.htm\">decree</a> awaiting congressional approval and new <a href=\"http://www.in.gov.br/web/dou/-/instrucao-normativa-n-9-de-16-de-abril-de-2020-253343033\">rules</a> at the indigenous agency Funai effectively legalise land grabbing in protected forests and indigenous reserves.</p> <p>\u201cThe indigenous peoples are alone and we have to fight against the virus, the loggers and the wildcat miners. We don\u2019t know which is worse,\u201d said Alessandra Munduruku, an indigenous leader from Par\u00e1 state.</p> <p>Bolsonaro, notorious for <a href=\"https://www.survivalinternational.org/articles/3540-Bolsonaro\">racist remarks about indigenous people</a> and a nationalist argument in favour of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/19/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-amazon-rainforest-deforestation\">developing the Amazon</a>, is popular among farmers, wildcat miners, loggers and land grabbers. He said the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/13/like-a-bomb-going-off-why-brazils-largest-reserve-is-facing-destruction-aoe\">Yanomami</a> indigenous reserve \u2013 Brazil\u2019s largest \u2013 was too big and attacked environment agencies for fining people for environmental crimes.</p> <p>In December 2019 he issued a decree known as MP910, allowing farmers squatting up to 2,500 hectares within government-controlled reserves to legalise it. A <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2017/07/temer-signs-law-that-could-see-millions-of-acres-lost-in-the-amazon/\">previous law</a> in 2017 allowed this for land squatted until 2011; Bolsonaro\u2019s decree extended it until 2018.</p> <p>Critics called it the \u201cland grabbers decree\u201d. Grabbing land on federal reserves by deforesting it, burning the dead trees and putting cattle on it to consolidate possession is common practice in the Amazon.</p> <p>\u201cThe measure permits titling public areas which were illegally deforested with the objective of obtaining the land,\u201d <a href=\"https://k6f2r3a6.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Nota_Tecnica_MP910_2019_Imazon.pdf\">said</a> Imazon, a non-profit environmentalist group. Federal prosecutors said it would further facilitate land grabbing, <a href=\"http://www.mpf.mp.br/pfdc/manifestacoes-pfdc/notas-tecnicas/nota-tecnica-8-2020-pfdc-mpf\">in a detailed analysis</a>.</p> <p>The decree has until 19 May to be approved by Congress. Lawmakers from the agricultural lobby are pushing for a vote before then, in the midst of the pandemic, after proposing <a href=\"https://www.congressonacional.leg.br/materias/medidas-provisorias/-/mpv/140116\">changes</a> that will effectively make it even easier and cheaper to legalise squatted land \u2013 even if the landowner seeking title has already received a land title under \u201cagrarian reform\u201d schemes and sold it on.</p> <p>On 22 April, Funai published a new rule to allow land grabbers on indigenous reserves to regularise their land, provided the reserve has not completed the lengthy demarcation process. That process can take decades to complete and requires presidential approval \u2013 and Bolsonaro has vowed not to demarcate \u201cone centimetre\u201d more of indigenous land.</p> <p>The Funai employees\u2019 association <a href=\"https://indigenistasassociados.org.br/2020/04/27/nota-tecnica-a-instrucao-normativa-da-funai-no-09-2020-e-a-gestao-de-interesses-em-torno-da-posse-de-terras-publicas/\">said</a> the new rule \u201cturns Funai into a real-estate notary for squatters, land grabbers and land developers in indigenous lands\u201d.</p> <p>The National Council of Human Rights, an independent federal body, called for the rule be revoked, noting that 237 indigenous reserves had yet to complete the demarcation process and another six were \u201crestricted use\u201d areas with reports of isolated groups who have no immunity to common diseases such as the flu, never mind Covid-19. Landgrabbers could now claim title in all of these.</p> <p>In a rare move, 49 federal prosecutors across Brazil <a href=\"http://www.mpf.mp.br/mt/sala-de-imprensa/Documentos%20para%20link/RECMT.pdf\">called</a> for the Funai rule to be annulled for its \u201cunconstitutionality, unconventionality and illegality\u201d.</p> <p>Daniel Azevedo, one of the prosecutors involved, said it encouraged land grabbers who would expect similar decrees to follow.</p> <p>\u201cThe Amazon works like a stock market. What those in power in the country say really influences people\u2019s behaviour,\u201d he said. \u201cThis passes on a message that if you deforest now in 2020 or 2021, you will soon become owner of this area,\u201d he added. \u201cThe tendency is the forest will be heavily devastated in the next few years.\u201d</p> <p>Those defending titles for land grabbers argue they will help regularise the Amazon\u2019s chaotic land ownership situation. Allowing farmers <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazil-tries-novel-fix-for-amazon-deforestation-legalize-squatters-11580486956\">to title land they squatted in the past</a> lets them access credit and improve productivity, reducing their need to expand further into the forest, farmers argue.</p> <p>Senator Iraj\u00e1 Abreu, who is guiding MP910 through Congress, <a href=\"https://congressoemfoco.uol.com.br/meio-ambiente/ministerio-publico-tcu-e-oposicao-alertam-para-os-riscos-da-mp-910/\">told</a> the Congress in Focus site that the land grabbers decree was a \u201cgood law for 99% of Brazilian families, for Brazilian producers, for people who create jobs\u201d. </p> <p>Funai said its new rule would \u201ccorrect unconstitutionalities detected in studies carried out\u201d.</p> <p>Environmentalists challenged that argument. \u201cThe government has a project and it is advancing over the forest, over indigenous peoples, to benefit those who want the forest cut down,\u201d said Mariana Mota, a public policy specialist at Greenpeace Brazil.</p> <p>Deforestation in Brazil <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/15/amazon-deforestation-increased-one-third\">began rising in 2013</a>, after a decade of decline and a year after an overhaul of Brazil\u2019s forest code by the leftist president Dilma Rousseff included an amnesty for people who deforested before 2008. Under Bolsonaro, deforestation has rocketed, reaching 9,800 square kilometres in the year to July 2019.</p> <p>As controversy over the new rules raged, Brazil\u2019s environment agency Ibama <a href=\"https://noticias.uol.com.br/colunas/rubens-valente/2020/04/30/ibama-exoneracoes-amazonia.htm\">sacked</a> Ren\u00ea de Oliveira and Hugo Loss, two high-level field specialists, weeks after they coordinated an operation to expel invaders on indigenous reserves in Par\u00e1 state over fears they could spread Covid-19.

  "<p>A prosecutor in Georgia said he would ask a grand jury to decide if charges should be filed against a white former law enforcement officer and his son over the fatal shooting of an unarmed young black man as he ran through a small town.</p> \n<p>The shooting of 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery outside Brunswick, Georgia, in February was captured on videotape and posted on social media on Tuesday, stirring outrage over the reluctance of prosecutors to file charges against Gregory McMichael and his son, Travis. </p> \n<p>The video footage, which was taken by an unidentified witness in another car, shows Arbery jogging down a narrow two-lane road and around a white pickup truck stopped in the right lane, its driver\u2019s door open.</p> \n<p>As Arbery crosses back in front of the truck a gunshot is fired. Arbery is then seen struggling with a man holding a long gun as a second man stands in the bed of the truck brandishing a revolver.

That grand jury might not meet until mid-June or later because courts were under restrictions imposed by the coronavirus pandemic, he said.</p> \n<p>According to a police report obtained by the New York Times, Gregory McMichael, a former police officer and district attorney\u2019s investigator, told investigators the incident began when he spotted Arbery from his front yard \u201chauling ass\u201d down the street.</p> \n<p>McMichael told police that, because he suspected Arbery in a string of recent neighborhood break-ins, he summoned his son and the two men gave chase in the truck, Gregory McMichael carrying a .357 Magnum revolver and Travis armed with a shotgun.</p> \n<p>Gregory McMichael said Arbery began to \u201cviolently attack\u201d his son and fought over the shotgun, prompting Travis to open fire. It is not clear from the police report or the videotape if Gregory McMichael also fired on Arbery.</p> \n<p>But it appears from the video footage that by the time the clearly unarmed Arbery is tussling with Travis McMichael, who is holding the long gun, a shot has already been fired.</p> \n<p>The Democratic presidential candidate and presumptive nominee Joe Biden tweeted that it was clear Arbery was killed \u201cin cold blood\u201d and called for a full murder investigation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1257876833581912065\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The video is clear: Ahmaud Arbery was killed in cold blood.

  "<h2><strong>The album to start with</strong></h2> <p><strong>Big Science (1982)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vkfpi2H8tOE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vkfpi2H8tOE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Laurie Anderson: O Superman \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>It was the 1981 breakout O Superman that flung multimedia artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/laurie-anderson\">Laurie Anderson</a> to No 2 in the UK singles charts and shortly thereafter into the arms of a record deal. After its instantly recognisable choppy a cappella intro, the track opens with a river of metronomic \u201cahs\u201d. The instrumentation remains minimal, leaving Anderson\u2019s voice to do most of the musical heavy lifting for its eight-minute duration. Despite the alien purr of the vocoder modulating her speech, O Superman is actually about techno-scepticism, written in the aftermath of a botched US military intervention in Iran.</p> <p>It certainly doesn\u2019t sound like the kind of thing major-label top brass would be knocking down your door for. But 1981 was a great year to be a musician embracing new technologies: Cybotron\u2019s Alleys of Your Mind and Kraftwerk\u2019s Computer World were just hitting shelves. Laurie Anderson, little known outside her New York art world, signed on for eight albums with Warner Bros.</p> <p>What came next was Big Science, a definitive take on avant-pop that used singsong cultural commentary and the ethereal sounds of the OB-Xa poly-synthesiser to paint a timeless portrait of America on the edge of a technological revolution. Throughout the album, Anderson embodies different characters in American society, letting them speak through her processed vocals and satirically authoritative lyrics. Despite being firmly rooted in the sounds and current events of the 80s, Big Science has aged well. As her proto-ASMR vocals lead us through tales of American planes falling from the sky, the construction of drive-in banks and love fading to disgust, she conjures an almost meditative state. But screeching bagpipes, jittery timpani and sorrowful violin interludes keep full rest out of reach, implying that just around the corner from placation, something sinister lies in wait.</p> <h2><strong>The three albums to check out next</strong></h2> <p><strong>Mister Heartbreak (1984)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaBbHGKLp88\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VaBbHGKLp88?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Laurie Anderson: Sharkey\u2019s Day \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Anderson described Mister Heartbreak as a journey into \u201cthe swamp\u201d \u2013 her spin on writing an album about love. She moved towards more organic sounds for her second release by mixing the howls of dogs, frogs and birds in with the deep hum of her Synclavier II. Where most of the material on Big Science was recycled from previous performance pieces, the songs on Mister Heartbreak were made to be an album \u2013 one bookended by dramatic accounts of a day in the life of a grocery cashier named Sharkey (the concluding one read by her close friend, William Burroughs). It maintains her trademark hypnotic minimalism while offering more in the way of melody, and sees Anderson coming into her own as a musician while staying true to her home in the downtown NYC art world.</p> <p><strong>Homeland (2010)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-1fDGCKdyk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/A-1fDGCKdyk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Laurie Anderson: Homeland/The Crash \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In 2010\u2019s Homeland, Anderson once again casts herself as a magnifying glass for America\u2019s absurdities. Produced in collaboration with long time creative counterpart Roma Baran and husband <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lou-reed\">Lou Reed</a>, the record was written about and comments on the hubris underpinning the 2008 financial crash: \u201cJust because all your friends were fired / And your family\u2019s broke and we didn\u2019t see it coming / Doesn\u2019t mean that we were wrong,\u201d she declares on the comically buoyant Only an Expert. To emphasise the album\u2019s more pointed commentary, she doubled down on her practice of \u201caudio drag\u201d, using different processing techniques to lower her voice and assume a male alter ego that speaks as \u201cthe voice of authority\u201d. By personifying America\u2019s capitalist myths and avoiding sloganeering, Anderson leaves space for the listener to come to their own conclusions.</p> <p><strong>Strange Angels (1989)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srdpv9lrJJY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/srdpv9lrJJY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Laurie Anderson: Beautiful Red Dress \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Coming in hot after a year of singing lessons, Strange Angels sees Anderson swapping her signature sprechgesang for full-blown song. The label wanted to replace her reputation as a contrarian performance artist with that of a sellable pop star, and Strange Angels is more commercial than previous works, embracing more conventional melodies and featuring a robust studio band. Yet unfortunately for Warner Brothers, all the commercial padding in the world couldn\u2019t hide Anderson\u2019s eccentricities. She growls like Satan on The Day of the Devil; Babydoll provides a singalong anthem for introverts and loners, while Beautiful Red Dress spars with the gender pay gap. Always a fascinating curator of collaborators, Anderson elicits vocal guest turns from Bobby McFerrin, Meat Loaf and NYC siblings the Roches, piano from avant-garde composer Gene Tyranny, and artwork from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/robert-mapplethorpe\">Robert Mapplethorpe</a>.</p> <h2><strong>One for the heads</strong></h2> <p><strong>Born, Never Asked / It\u2019s Cold Outside (1978 / 1981)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQBlvyE460A\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EQBlvyE460A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Laurie Anderson: Born, Never Asked / It\u2019s Cold Outside \u2013 stream</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Buried between lilting stings and fuzzy vocals in this collection of Anderson\u2019s first ever compositions are the seeds of what would eventually grow into songs Let X=X, O Superman, and Born, Never Asked.

  "<p>Yvonne Terlingen, who has died of ovarian cancer aged 75, was of the pioneering generation that shaped Amnesty International. She worked for AI probably longer than anyone else.</p> <p>The daughter of Annie (nee Donker), a schoolteacher, and Bout Terlingen, a building contractor, she was born in Amsterdam and grew up there, along with her older brother, Rob, and an older half-brother, Tom. Yvonne went to the city\u2019s Gymnasium Fons Vitae, then graduated in law from the University of Amsterdam.</p> <p>Yvonne started work in London in 1972 as AI\u2019s south Asia researcher. Decades later she is still remembered in the region. \u201cOf course I knew Yvonne Terlingen,\u201d said one elderly Sri Lankan. \u201cShe visited us in prison in 1975.\u201d </p> <p>Much later, on sabbatical, Yvonne worked at the United Nations international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague in 1995-96, and in Belgrade in 1996-97; she then returned to AI as adviser on international organisations. She served nine years from 2001 until her retirement in 2010 as Amnesty\u2019s UN representative in New York.</p> <p>At AI, ideals turned into practical action and work with colleagues resulted in lifelong friendships. Yvonne brought to her work a fierce sense of justice, singleminded dedication, profound knowledge of human rights, sharp intellect, boundless energy and a disarmingly direct approach. Colleagues testify to her strength, spirit and independence. Always ready to share her wisdom, she was also candid in acknowledging and sharing mistakes.</p> <p>In retirement Yvonne volunteered at the Heathrow immigration removal centres. She returned to New York to play a central role in the \u2013 strikingly successful \u2013 civil society campaign 1 for 7 Billion to open up the process for selection of the UN secretary general in 2016 and beyond.</p> <p>An essential part of Yvonne was her keen aesthetic sense, her deep love of art and music, and her own significant talents in both. She played the harpsichord, her instruments made for her by her dear friend and former partner, Chris Nobbs, with whom she had a daughter, Hannah.</p> <p>I first met Yvonne 45 years ago, through her work in AI, and we became close friends. She was a caring friend to so many: warm, extraordinarily thoughtful, kind and tremendous fun.</p> <p>Hannah was never far from her mind and Yvonne\u2019s last months were wonderfully sustained by their loving relationship. \u201cI am so lucky\u201d was her constant refrain to family and friends. Yvonne had an intense enthusiasm for life. She died as she lived, with courage, integrity, grace and love.</p> <p>She is survived by Hannah and Rob. Tom predeceased her.</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>",

Is this discrimination? | Gene Marks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cA lot of the money that was set aside for small businesses did not end up in the businesses that we own and operate,\u201d said Ron Busby, president of US Black Chambers, a not-for-profit advocacy group for black business owners. \u201cWhen this piece of legislation came out and it did not address an equitable way for black and brown business owners to get access to capital, it is a huge burden for us.\u201d</p> <p>As black Americans face disproportionately harsh <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/28/african-americans-unemployment-covid-19-economic-impact\">economic</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/coronavirus-racial-disparities-african-americans\">health</a> consequences due to the Covid-19 crisis, advocates say black business owners have been having difficulty getting access to the funds because many black-owned businesses do not have relationships with established banks. As business owners rushed to apply for loans, which were given on a first-come, first-serve basis, some banks said they were <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/4/7/21209584/paycheck-protection-program-banks-access\">giving priority</a> to existing clients.</p> <p>Black business owners can face discriminatory hurdles when approaching traditional banks for a business loan that prevents them from building credit and building a relationship with a bank.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.usu.edu/today/story/usu-research-shows-discrimination-in-small-business-lending-practices\">Research</a> has shown that even with the same credit history, black business owners seeking small business loans receive less friendly treatment and information about a bank\u2019s services compared with their white counterparts. In 2017, a Federal Reserve <a href=\"https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/press-releases/2017/pr-20171108-atlanta-and-cleveland-feds.aspx\">study</a> found that, though black business owners apply for small business loans at a higher rate than white business owners, the approval rate for white entrepreneurs is 19% higher than the approval rate for black entrepreneurs.</p> <p>For black business owners, not getting the loans they need can start a vicious cycle where they continuously struggle to pay any credit they take out. \u201cYou end up either suffering through the process trying to figure out how to pay, [or] you\u2019re not able to pay in full, which means your credit is damaged because you\u2019re not paying on time,\u201d Busby said. \u201cWe never get out of that hole.\u201d</p> <p>Many minority business owners have much stronger relationships with community development financial institutions and minority depository institutions that are smaller, but friendlier toward those who are often turned away by traditional banks. These types of banks experienced more technical difficulties in setting up loan applications for the paycheck protection program. As a result, Congress <a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN11355\">allocated</a> $30bn out of the second wave of funding to be set aside specifically for these community financial institutions.</p> <p>Kita Holmes, the owner of 5 Star Property Management, said that she has had difficulty getting a loan for her Maryland-based property management company that has seen a decline in new renters and property investors since the crisis started.</p> <p>Though she applied for a loan during the program\u2019s first round of funding through her bank, she never received a response to her application. The only line of credit she had was closed, and she is worried about the future of her business.</p> <p>\u201cI have saved, but if this market doesn\u2019t open up and things don\u2019t change pretty quickly \u2026 I don\u2019t know what will happen. I will probably look for work,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give up, but it\u2019s very hard times for a small black business owner.\u201d</p> <p>Because the payroll protection program stipulates that a bulk of the loan must be used for payroll expenses in order to be forgiven, many black business owners could be excluded from forgiveness since a majority do not have employees on payroll.</p> <p>Only about 120,000 black-owned businesses, out of the 2.7m in the US, have employees on payroll, Busby said. Because the average annual revenue of a black-owned business is $75,000, \u201cit\u2019s hard to have anyone else work for you when you\u2019re only bringing in enough revenue to pay expenses and keep yourself employed\u201d, he added.</p>",
  "<p>Before the internet ruined the World Cup there was wonder in ignorance. You could look forward to discovering great players and teams about whom you knew next to nothing. In 1986 my brother and I hoped the tournament would be all about some Hungarian called Zoltan Peter. Our reason was bad.</p> <p>All we knew about Peter was his name and his face because he seemed to be in every pack of Panini stickers we bought. Every time we removed that shiny wrapper there he was, seemingly mocking us with his Lego-man hairdo and the haunting expression of someone who knew there is no problem so grim it cannot be made worse.</p> <p>When the tournament kicked off we had nearly 100 Peterstickers. He was unswappable. My brother started sticking them all over the place. Our home came to resemble the capital city of a totalitarian state, with pictures of the feared ruler wherever you turned.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"95eb2f0b1040fa0013997ddc0777162b30c2fac9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95eb2f0b1040fa0013997ddc0777162b30c2fac9/50_14_685_962/356.jpg\" alt=\"Zoltan Peter\u2019s face was everywhere we looked early on in the 1986 World Cup tournament.\" width=\"356\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zoltan Peter\u2019s face was everywhere we looked early on in the 1986 World Cup tournament.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Panini</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The hope was Peter would reveal himself to be a genius in Mexico, the breakout star of the tournament, a player whose stickers would suddenly be in hot demand, making us akin to lucky imbeciles who accidentally bought shares in an oil company just before it struck black gold.</p> <p>Some pundits made Hungary dark horses for success. They had qualified instead of the Netherlands and they would be highly motivated for their first match \u2013 against the USSR 30 years after the bloody suppression of the 1956 Hungarian revolution.</p> <p>We thought we knew a little about the Soviets, since the first Republic of Ireland match we attended was against them in the first qualifier for the finals. A glorious goal by Mickey Walsh yielded a win that took Ireland nowhere. USSR advanced by winning all their home games but none of their away ones. They were so blunt in the run-up to Mexico \u2013 scoring once in five friendlies \u2013 that they replaced their manager just before the tournament, rehiring Valeriy Lobanovskyi, whom they had previously jilted. Hungary\u2019s for the taking?</p> <p>Peter turned out to be a tall 21-year-old, a left-back on the raw side. When Nikolay Larionov ran down the right for the Soviets in the second minute, Peter hurtled towards him with all the control of a man using roller skates for the first time. Crash. Viktor Chanov dabbed the resultant free-kick towards the near post, Hungary defended pitifully and Pavel Yakovenko slotted the ball into the net. Oh, for Pete\u2019s sake.</p> <p>Then Sergei Aleinikov blasted in a stupendous drive from miles out. Two-nil to the USSR after five minutes. My brother and I now yearned, petty as you like, for total Hungarian humiliation.</p> <p>In sport it can feel wholesome to want your rival to be crushed. Easing off is a betrayal. Back in the Cold War days commentators called teams from behind the Iron Curtain \u201ccrack outfits\u201d and \u201cruthless machines\u201d, their forwards not baby-faced assassins but cold-blooded, robotic ones. It was dehumanising hooey but, on this occasion, we demanded the Soviets be heartless.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7e35a13e649bd1d53e8329bdb62c81545bea6c4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e35a13e649bd1d53e8329bdb62c81545bea6c4b/0_0_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hungary\u2019s goalkeeper Peter Disztl (left) can only look on as Sergei Rodionov from the USSR team runs through the Hungarian defence before slotting the ball home for the Soviets\u2019 sixth and final goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The goalkeeper Peter Disztl (left) can only look on as Sergei Rodionov runs through Hungary\u2019s defence before slotting the ball home for the USSR\u2019s sixth and final goal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But wait! In the 21<sup>st</sup> minute Hungary won a free-kick within shooting range and Peter stepped up to take it. He ran over the ball, the big tease, and Lajos Detari booted it into the stands. Then another woeful Hungarian tackle led to a penalty being lashed home by Igor Belanov, who, like Yakovenko, proved a genuinely thrilling discovery.</p> <p>In the 62<sup>nd</sup> minute Hungary made their first substitution: off came Peter. Two young clowns on a couch thousands of miles away made obscene hand gestures in his direction. Then we urged the USSR, as if they were our proxies, to enforce more vengeance.</p> <p>With eight players from Dynamo Kyiv they were brilliant, far too nifty for disintegrating opponents. But in the second half the Soviets, all too human, relaxed a tad, saving energy for a deep run in the tournament. They still scored three more times, twice into an empty net after slick moves and once thanks to an own goal by Laszlo Dajka.</p> <p>USSR even missed another penalty. Vadym Yevtushenko blazed it so high the commentator wondered if he had misfired out of sympathy. But some people felt 6-0 was the least Peter and co deserved \u2013 and, at the final whistle, those people tore up a pile of unused stickers and staged an Argentina 78-style ticker-tape parade in their front room.</p> <p>Peter did not appear again in the tournament.</p>",

Even at this moment we dare not forget that war still rages over a quarter of the globe, that British, Americans, and Chinese are being wounded or killed every hour of the day, and that many of the men who have won this victory in Europe will have again to screw their courage to the sticking-point and risk their lives in the Far East. And that is not an easy thing to do. Yet when all is said it remains a moment of immense deliverance. It is not only that for the first time for five and a half long years Europe no longer hears the sound of guns, and our ships can sail Western waters without fear of mine or submarine. It is not only that never again need women in London \u2013 or Berlin \u2013 start at the sound of the telephone because they fear the siren. It is rather the knowledge that children are playing on swings in the camp at Belsen and that all over Europe the slave workers of Germany, the prisoners, and the persecuted are trudging homewards, weary, broken, but free. We have solved nothing. We are no nearer the Golden Age. But at least we have stopped the onrush of evil. We have won the right to hope.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/exhausted-relieved-yearning-for-change-britain-on-ve-day\">Exhausted, relieved, yearning for change: Britain on VE Day</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bishop Butler of the <a href=\"http://archives.dickinson.edu/sundries/butlers-analogy\">Analogy </a>would walk for hours in his garden at Bristol on the darkest nights pondering the narrow line which divides the rational from the insane. On one such occasion he stopped short and exclaimed to his companion</p> <blockquote> <p>Why might not whole communities and public bodies be seized with fits of insanity as well as individuals! Nothing but this principle, that they are liable to insanity, can account for the major part of those transactions of which we read to history.</p> </blockquote> <p>It is tempting to-day to explain away the events of the past ten years in some such terms. (Is not Himmler himself reported to have said that Germany was now a vast lunatic asylum?) But this will not do. We may not know the answer to the troubles of mankind but at least we know some of the causes. We have learnt, or should have learn, how dangerous is the spirit of nationalism when harnessed to the fact of power. We have seen what can happen to a great nation which surrenders to its leaders the freedom of thought and speech and conscience. We have ourselves felt the terrible power of destruction which man has acquired through science uncontrolled by wisdom. We have learnt (at what a cost!) that the platitudes of Geneva were the urgent truth, and that the brotherhood of man, the unity of nations, and the indivisibility of peace are facts which we can no longer ignore. But knowledge is not enough. Fear, hatred, nationalism and the like are not rational states but emotions which for a long time will continue to govern human behaviour and which will be fed by the chaos and misery in Europe. Hunger and unemployment are not the best schools for reason and tolerance, but they will have many pupils.</p> <p>Over wide areas of Europe the bridges are broken; there is no link with the past But the past was not all bad, and we must nurse the embers of our civilisation until it can blaze again as it did after other great European catastrophes \u2013 after the age of the Barbarians and the long night of the Dark Ages, and after the Thirty Years War. To-day, the people of Europe want above all peace, security, and a decent living. But they also want again that sense of freedom, progress, and enjoyment of life which gave meaning to the nineteenth century. In spite of all that has happened, in spite of our failures and hesitation, the majority still look to the West. But if we fail them again, if we do not help them by our policy and example, they will turn to the East, accepting the loss of their individual freedom as the price of security and social progress. We must prove that just as liberal democracy is a match for dictatorship in war, so in peace it can provide for its people all and more than is offered by Communism and National Socialism. But it will not be easy. If the war has tried our courage and endurance, the peace will test our wisdom and our faith.<br><em>This is an edited extract. <a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2020/05/05/First_light_8_May_45.jpg\">Read the article in full.</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c74bedd4d66f09c2237d4c58dbcdfbd360263dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c74bedd4d66f09c2237d4c58dbcdfbd360263dd/0_14_1888_1132/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Princess Elizabeth joins, from left, Queen Elizabeth, Winston Churchill, King George VI, and Princess Margaret, on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, 8 May 1945.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Princess Elizabeth joins, from left, Queen Elizabeth, Winston Churchill, King George VI, and Princess Margaret, on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, 8 May 1945.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1945/may/09/secondworldwar.fromthearchive1\">The War\u2019s Official End</a></h2> <p>9 May 1945</p> <p>The war against Germany officially came to an end at one minute past midnight this morning after a day of victory rejoicings by the people of Britain and her allies all over the world.</p> <p>Mr. Churchill\u2019s broadcast declaration that the war had ended and that we might allow ourselves \u201ca brief period of rejoicing\u201d set the seal on celebrations which were already under way.

The German Government surrendered unconditionally at 2 41 am. (French time) on the morning of Monday, May 7, when General Jodl signed the Act of Military Surrender at Rheims. This Act laid down that all operations would cease at 11 1 pm. (Central European time) on the evening of Tuesday, May 8, although, as Mr Churchill said in his broadcast, \u201cin the interests of saving lives the ceasefire began yesterday (May 7) to be sounded all along the front.\u201d But Mr Churchill also said that \u201chostilities will end officially at one minute after midnight to-night, Tuesday, May 8\u201d\u2026 or, to be strictly accurate, on the morning of Wednesday, May 9.</p> <p>This difference of an hour can, of course, be explained by the difference between Central European time and British time, but it does not alter the curious fact that \u201cofficially\u201d the war ended for Germany at 11 pm on Tuesday, May 8, and for us at one minute after midnight on the morning of Wednesday, May 9. If this were all, the matter would be simple enough. It has, however, been further complicated by the Russian insistence on a second ceremony in Berlin. The reason for this is plain. There was nothing wrong with the surrender at Rheims, but the Russians felt that it would impress their defeat more strongly on the German people if the ceremony took place in Berlin, their capital, and if the document were signed by Field Marshal Keitel himself, the Chief of the German High Command and the best known of the Nazi generals. There was also the fact that, surrender or not, the Germans were still resisting the Red Army in Czechoslovakia.</p> <p>But it was one thing to agree on a second surrender and another to keep the first a secret. The Associated Press has been blamed (a little unjustly) because its correspondent at Supreme Allied Headquarters revealed the news to Britain and America. The correspondent may have been at fault, but it is clear that even if he had not sent the message the news would still have got out. <br><em><a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2020/05/05/past_11.jpg\">Continue reading</a>.</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/08/ve-day-victory-in-europe-denmark-1945-archive\">VE Day - two German cruisers await surrender: from the archive, 8 May 1945</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>The transition period: danger of spheres of influence<br></h2> <p>From our Diplomatic Correspondent <br>11 May 194<br><em>London, Thursday</em><br>While the last German units are laying down their arms all over Europe the rapid drama of events that led to their surrender gives place to a period of waiting upon political and diplomatic developments.</p> <p>In the liberated countries the change over from war to the transition period should not be technically difficult in theory, though the national and international problems are enormous everywhere. Elaborate preparations have been made for this transition by the Great Powers, the Governments in exile, and their resistance movements at home. The time has now come to apply these plans. In practice the application of the blue-print seems to bring its difficulties, and, even technically, some rather delicate situations have arisen in almost every count, in East and South-east Europe, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia especially.<br><br><strong>Future of Trieste</strong><br>The Government of the new Yugoslavia is violently opposed to the occupation of Trieste by Western Allied troops. It may be that a free port and international status for the town, with Italian sovereignty in cultural questions, would best serve the Allied and European cause, especially during the years of transition. If this cannot be, then there is a case for its return to Italy because an overwhelming majority of its inhabitants are Italian.</p> <p>With that view even the Italian Communists concur, although their desire for good relations with Yugoslavia is sincere, and they are prepared to make generous concessions. They admit that Yugoslavia has a just claim to the hinterland of Trieste and that a solution must be found in a partition between town and hinterland.</p> <p>In other zones, Norway, Denmark, and Holland notably, the change over from the war has gone more smoothly. Fears lest Norwegians should be unable alone to handle their transition period have proved to be unfounded and there has been no need to call on Sweden for the peaceful kind of assistance that she was prepared to give. Through effective organisation between the exiled Government and its delegates in Norway, the Norwegian underground movement was able to take over Government departments and local administration from the moment the war ended.</p> <p>In the conquered territories, Austria especially, difficulties again seem to be in the forefront. Although it was decided at Yalta that the control of Austria should be a joint one, with Russian, British, American, and French zones of occupation and a central Allied Control Commission sitting in Vienna, no British, American, or French representative of the Commission has yet arrived in Austria.</p> <p><strong>Allies and Germany</strong><br>Whether or not there can still be a technical explanation of the delay in Austria is comparatively unimportant. The serious question is whether there is to be a united Allied policy in Europe or whether one of the Great Powers is going to prejudice this hope by a one-sided power policy towards Austria and perhaps towards Germany too. Were there disunity of purpose and policy towards Germany, then, of course, the test case for all Allied unity would be lost.</p> <p>The problem is not one of experiment or compromise but of principle. The way it is handled will decide not only the future of Germany and Austria but whether there is to be real co-operation and agreement between the Allies. Will there be one Austria reorganised under the supervision of one Power and four Germanys with separate lives in the different zones of occupation.</p> <p>Such a solution would play directly into the hands of the Germans, and there are still amongst them a majority who even in defeat are thinking in terms of power policy alone. It would be not only a solution against the new forces in Europe, but the best guarantee of the continuation of Germany\u2019s imperialist consciousness which would concentrate first on the demarcation lines between the different Germanys.</p> <p>During the past few weeks there has been a clear and dangerous move towards creating spheres of influence within liberated Allied and conquered enemy territory. Such weight upon Europe would stunt her natural development as a variegated but harmonious whole. All history and not least that of the immediate past has shown that the Continent cannot be dominated by one force or ideology. This was so before Hitler and remains so after him.</p>",
  "<p>The UK health secretary has said he would back the police in any action they wish to take over Prof Neil Ferguson breaking social distancing rules by having a woman visit him at his home.</p> \n<p>Ferguson, an epidemiologist who has helped shape the government\u2019s response to coronavirus and who advocated the lockdown, made the right decision to resign, Matt Hancock told Sky News.</p> \n<p>Hancock said: \u201cI back the police here. They will take their decisions independently from ministers, that\u2019s quite right, it\u2019s always been like that.<br><br>\u201cEven though I have got a clear answer to what I think, as a minister the way we run the police is that they make decisions like this. So I give them their space to make that decision, but I think he took the right decision to resign.\u201d</p> \n<p>Scotland Yard said later no further action would be taken against Ferguson. A Met police statement criticised his behaviour as \u201cplainly disappointing\u201d but ruled out issuing a fine because he \u201chas taken responsibility\u201d after resigning. The police declined to say whether officers had spoken directly to Ferguson.</p> \n<p>Ferguson, who works with an Imperial College London team whose modelling influenced the government\u2019s decision to move to a lockdown, resigned after the Telegraph revealed that Antonia Staats had crossed London from her family home to visit him on at least two occasions, on 30 March and 8 April, since lockdown measures were imposed.</p> \n<p>The scandal was revealed on Tuesday, when figures showed the UK\u2019s official death toll from coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-above-32000-to-highest-in-europe\">had exceeded that of Italy</a> to become the highest in Europe.<br><br>Hancock said physical distancing rules were very important and everyone should follow them. He said he had supported the Scottish police warning to Dr Catherine Calderwood, the Scottish chief medical officer who visited her second home during lockdown.</p> \n<p>He described Ferguson\u2019s decision to flout lockdown rules as \u201cextraordinary\u201d and one that had left him \u201cspeechless\u201d.</p> \n<p>Asked whether he was speechless by the presenter, Kay Burley, he said: \u201cI am.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cProf Ferguson is a very, very eminent and impressive scientist and the science he\u2019s done has been an important part of what we\u2019ve listened to, and I think he took the right decision to resign,\u201d Hancock added.</p> \n<p>He said he would not have fought for Ferguson to keep his job.</p> \n<p>Earlier, another senior minister urged people to stick unequivocally to the coronavirus lockdown.</p> \n<p>James Brokenshire, a Home Office minister, said Ferguson had made an \u201cerror of judgment\u201d and was right to resign. He stressed that the government\u2019s physical distancing guidelines must be followed by law and were \u201cthere to protect us all\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-adviser-prof-neil-ferguson-resigns-after-breaking-lockdown-rules\">Ferguson\u2019s resignation</a> had been \u201can appropriate course\u201d because other people had tried so hard to stick to the lockdown, even though it had been hard not to see loved ones.</p> \n<p>In a round of broadcast interviews, Brokenshire stressed it was still important to follow the lockdown rules before Thursday\u2019s review of whether they should be extended, and any decision to ease them would be \u201ccareful, cautious and thoughtful\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902XLVK1dmuLhUs/\" data-alt=\"Graph\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902XLVK1dmuLhUs/\">Graph</a> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/05/neil-ferguson-20-years-experience-with-pathogen-outbreaks\">Neil Ferguson: 20 years' experience with pathogen outbreaks</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Pressed on why the outcome has been so bad in the UK, Brokenshire gave the clearest acknowledgment yet that the government accepted it had made errors in its response to the coronavirus outbreak.</p> \n<p>He told Sky News: \u201cThere is an acknowledgement mistakes have been made \u2013 no government is going to get everything right.

It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>\n    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>\n    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>\n    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.</p>\n    <p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a>&nbsp;says it should be the \u201cbackbone of the response\u201d in every country.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\"><b>Sarah Boseley</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>However, the minister appeared to suggest testing levels had been low because of \u201ccapacity constraints\u201d, while at the time politicians and scientists were saying a widespread testing regime was not necessary because the point had passed for trying to contain and suppress the virus.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cWould there have been benefit in having that extra capacity, as Patrick Vallance highlighted in his evidence yesterday? Yes.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe challenge that we had was that we have some fantastic laboratories, some fantastic expertise, but it has been the capacity restraints that we have had, and therefore that has posed challenges, but also that has now been ramped up to go from 2,000 tests [per day] in February to 120,000 at the end of April.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The coronavirus lockdown has caused major disruption to students, driving many back home as universities have been forced to close, leaving their rented halls of residence or privately rented rooms empty.</p> \n<p>Some accommodation providers have agreed to waive or cut fees, but others have refused to release students from their contracts. Students in privately run accommodation in several cities have gone on rent strike, including Portsmouth and Bristol.</p> \n<p>Issues about whether or not students must continue to pay rent for accommodation that they are not using due to the coronavirus crisis will depend on the type of accommodation or their tenancy agreement.</p> \n<p>If a student has a private landlord, it is likely they will have entered into an assured shorthold tenancy agreement, which may be hard to get out of, says Daniel Fitzpatrick, a housing partner at the law firm Hodge Jones &amp; Allen, although they could try arguing that the contract has been frustrated by the Covid-19 outbreak.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cfdf0e57-592b-4f76-ad35-f210d0c08493\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/H3d6rAA8hCA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In rare instances, tenancy agreements contain a \u201cforce majeure\u201d clause, allowing parties to terminate a contract if events beyond their control prevent them for performing their obligations under it.</p> \n<p>While Covid-19 may be a force majeure event, says Manjinder Kaur Atwal, director of housing and property litigation at the law firm Duncan Lewis, it is unlikely to stop a tenancy from continuing.</p> \n<p>If students have entered into a contract for a fixed period of time, which is yet to expire, she explains there may be a break clause allowing them to terminate the contract before the end of the fixed term, after providing the required notice.</p> \n<p>Students are advised to negotiate with their landlord immediately, as the obligation to pay their rent will continue in accordance with their contract, and adds Atwal, they could remain liable for any rent due up to the expiry of the notice period.</p> \n<p>If the contract does not have a break clause or it cannot be applied yet, there is no automatic right to end the contract. Here, students seeking to terminate their tenancy should notify their landlord.</p> \n<p>Fitzpatrick says a landlord may agree to terminate the contract, in which case they will no longer have to pay the rent. Alternatively, a landlord may agree to a rent reduction or waiver for a certain period.</p> \n<p>In the event the student is not released from the contract, Atwal adds, the landlord has the right to request the money due from the student or their guarantor, even after the student has moved out.</p> \n<p>Students could press the landlord to try to rent the property out to others in order to mitigate any loss, suggests Fitzpatrick, noting that once the property is re-let, the landlord cannot continue to charge them.</p> \n<p>If a student rents accommodation with others, some of whom do not want to terminate their contract, she adds, that it is unlikely that a student would be able to leave without continuing to pay the rent unless a replacement tenant is found and agreed with the landlord.</p> \n<p>For students renting university halls of residence, some universities have agreed to release students from rent obligations. Where they have not, Fitzpatrick suggests that students have a strong case for arguing that they should not be charged for accommodation they are no longer able to use.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey could argue that they have only rented the accommodation because they are going to that university, and as they cannot go to university they should be able to end the contract.\u201d</p> \n<p>If the accommodation is rented from a private landlord recommended by the university, it will be harder for students to get out of paying the rent due, he says.</p> \n<p>But he suggests contact their student union and liaison officers and ask them to get the university to negotiate with landlords and press them to waive or reduce rents.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhere a university has given landlords business over the years, they could suggest that if they do not help their students now, they won\u2019t give them students in the future or they will tell their students to look for other providers\u201d.</p> \n<p>Where students come to an agreement with their landlord to change terms, Fitzpatrick suggests noting it in writing, but adds, an email will do rather than a formally drafted contract.</p> \n<p>Failure to pay rent that is due or clear arrears, Fitzpatrick warns, can lead to the enforcement action by the landlord, seeking a possession order if the property is still occupied and/or a money claim for the debt if the property has been vacated.</p> \n<p>Failure to pay could result in the landlord instructing bailiffs to obtain the value of the money judgment, and he warns, the judgment against them could affect their credit rating, which could affect their future financial plans, making it harder to get credit or loans.</p> \n<p>Further information is provided by the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/876500/Consolidated_Landlord_and_Tenant_Guidance_COVID_and_the_PRS_v4.2.pdf\">Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government</a>. UK students who are struggling financially may also be eligible for <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/universal-credit-and-students\">benefits</a> to help pay rent, Atwal says.</p>",
  "<p>In his five years as a hospital chaplain, the Rev Steven Chewning has anointed the sick more times than he can remember.</p> <p>The ritual of applying oil to the forehead of someone ill or dying is considered one of the most intimate of Christian sacraments. But when Covid-19 restricted Chewning\u2019s access and left him working from home, a family\u2019s request to anoint a young father who was intubated and critical forced him to get creative. While performing the rite over speakerphone with the help of a nurse (who is an atheist), Chewning found himself not only reimagining his own duties, but the very conception of holy space.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/were-ready-if-we-are-needed-east-london-mosque-opens-covid-19-morgue\">'We're ready if we are needed': East London Mosque opens Covid-19 morgue</a> </p> </aside>  <p>From his bedroom, the chaplain recited his litany, reading from <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+6%3A13%2CJames+5%3A14-15&amp;version=NIV\">James 5 and Mark 6</a>, where Jesus first sends his disciples to anoint the sick. \u201cO Holy One, giver of health and salvation, send your holy spirit to sanctify this oil,\u201d he prayed, his words ringing over the drone of the ventilator. \u201cAs your holy apostles anointed many who were sick so may those who in faith receive this holy unction be made whole. Can you please rub a drop of oil on the patient\u2019s forehead?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want me to make it like a cross? I think that\u2019d be meaningful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, sure, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p> <p>He then wet his finger with oil and anointed the intubated believer. As soon as Chewning wrapped up his prayer, he shouted: \u201cHey, did you hear that alarm going off? He moved while you were doing the blessing! He hasn\u2019t move since he got here three days ago. I think he heard what you said.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>\u201cFor me, the hospital room has always been sacred ground,\u201d says Chewning, who works at UNC medical center in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. \u201cWhen I wash my hands it\u2019s to purify myself before I go into meet God and the patient. But that theology no longer applies.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>'A lot of people are dying and they\u2019ve not had any kind of touch since it all began'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For chaplains working in hospitals, the virus has obliterated the old places and practices where they once channeled the divine: the quiet bedside, an embrace in the hallway, a hand on a trembling shoulder. Like the ancient Israelites who carried God in a tent while they wandered through the wilderness, chaplains are having to find God in unexpected places. They\u2019re using Zoom, FaceTime and Amazon Echo to comfort those who are afraid or seeking answers about death and dying, to administer last rites, or connect families for prayers and final wrenching goodbyes. The intimacy of a hospital room has been replaced by the cold detachment of a telephone call to comfort a grieving spouse or parent, who are often in quarantine themselves. And chaplains are doing all of this with half their skillset intact.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of what we do is based on non-verbal communication,\u201d Chewning says. \u201cA lot of what we do involves holding sacred silence, trying not to fill that sacred silence with empty words. Just being still and fully present with people. How do you do communicate sacred silence over a phone call?\u201d</p> <p>Chewning normally works in the hospital\u2019s oncology unit, but started staying home once UNC admitted Covid patients. His six-year-old son has a congenital heart defect that has required three open-heart surgeries, and due to the boy\u2019s vulnerability to the virus, his doctor told Chewning that if he reported to work not to come home for two months. So when UNC restricted the Covid ward to medical personnel due to lack of PPE, Chewning became its chaplain from the remove of a makeshift bedroom office.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d20638b271e4b4c38e6499d0198b222c87a7a9aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d20638b271e4b4c38e6499d0198b222c87a7a9aa/0_0_2667_4000/667.jpg\" alt=\"Maddalone, a former Presbyterian minister, stands outside Northern Westchester hospital, where she is the only chaplain.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Rev Angela Maddalone, a former Presbyterian pastor, stands outside Northern Westchester hospital, where she is the only chaplain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lauren Lancaster/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While his mother-in-law watches his kids, Chewning spends his days talking and praying with people he\u2019s never met in person, usually through their room phones or a tablet administered by a nurse. For patients who are intubated on ventilators, he\u2019s the bridge of support with their worried families.</p> <p>For the man who received the anointing, the request came from his mother, who was Pentecostal. The patient was young, married with small children, and identified as Christian. At first the other chaplains felt it wasn\u2019t possible, but Chewning felt determined to make it happen. He found the nurse who worked the floor and asked if he\u2019d be willing to apply the anointing oil while Chewning prayed. \u201cWell, I\u2019m an atheist,\u201d the nurse answered, \u201cbut I\u2019m glad to do it.\u201d Chewning asked his fellow chaplains to run the oil to the Covid floor, and the next time the nurse made his rounds, he called Chewning: \u201cI\u2019m at the bedside and I\u2019ve got you on speakerphone.\u201d</p> <p>The next morning, the man\u2019s wife called Chewning elated and requested he continue to pray. \u201cWe\u2019ll take anything,\u201d she said. So he started dialing her in with FaceTime, and together with their bodies and prayers projected into a room where fear and sorrow lick at the four corners, they consecrate sacred space, one the virus cannot hold. \u201cAll I have are my words now,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>For the Rev Angela Maddalone, everything has become holy, every step of ground. The former Presbyterian pastor had been working at Northern Westchester hospital in New York for exactly a month when the coronavirus swept through the suburb. Now, as the lone chaplain in her hospital, she confronts death on a daily basis. Although she\u2019s allowed to minister to patients who are \u201cimmanent\u201d, she laments that the cumbersome PPE works to distance her from those who need physical comfort.</p> <p>\u201cWhen someone starts to cry, my first reaction is to hold their hand,\u201d she says. \u201cNow it\u2019s with a gloved hand. So a lot of people are dying and they\u2019ve not had any kind of touch since it all began.\u201d But even with floors in lockdown, she says, no one is dying alone. \u201cThe nurses have been unbelievably compassionate. They\u2019re present in these people\u2019s lives. One nurse asked me, \u2018I just don\u2019t know what to say.\u2019 I told her, \u2018Just keep on saying, \u2018You\u2019re not alone. I am with you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Each floor of the hospital is equipped with tablets that Maddalone uses to connect family members to loved ones who are on the brink of death, family who would otherwise receive a phone call after the fact. A son in Oregon who was able to speak to his father one last time. A woman gazing at her husband through a screen. \u201cImagine yourself in the room,\u201d Maddalone tells her. \u201cImagine holding his hand and telling him whatever you want to tell him.\u201d She uses Zoom and FaceTime, and when she\u2019s unable to visit a certain patient, some rooms are equipped with Amazon Echo Show, where a camera can beam images to loved ones in an instant \u2013 all under the hospital\u2019s secure network that ensures privacy.</p> <p>As a pastor for 20 years at churches in neighboring Rockland county, Maddalone plied her trade with a warm embrace. She baptized babies and laid hands on the sick, passed the peace and buried the dead. God was in the hugs that congratulated newlyweds and young graduates, in the tears that fell whenever anyone received a scary diagnosis. So much assurance had passed through her hands, and now that conduit has been largely closed. \u201cSometimes I\u2019m behind my PPE and I can\u2019t wait \u2026\u201d she says, then pauses to compose herself. \u201cI can\u2019t wait until I can hold all these people again.\u201d</p> <p>The virus and its cruel isolation have reminded her what she\u2019s long known, that God lives in the small and in-between spaces of each day, in the seemingly inconsequential. In the case of Gatorade that miraculously appeared one afternoon after a nurse, sweltering in her PPE during long and awful shift, had muttered, \u201cI could really use a Gatorade.\u201d And the divine is in every pair of eyes that open after a ventilator is switched off and life is granted another day. In the small and labored steps down a hallway as they learn to walk again, each little shuffle a thousand loaves and fishes.</p> <p>\u201cEverything feels so sacred right now,\u201d she says. \u201cThese little synchronicities assure me there\u2019s a force greater than myself out there at work.\u201d</p> <p>And she\u2019s learned to embrace the divine that moves through a Zoom chat, even as her hands can no longer touch. \u201cWe have to get used to seeing God differently,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s made me so grateful that we even have this technology. Because imagine if we didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Just that day she\u2019d witnessed a last exchange between a man and his two sons. The man was intubated and going quickly. Using FaceTime, Maddalone called the sons so they could see their father and tell him that he wasn\u2019t alone. At the sound of their voice, he was able to let go.</p>",

The statement said there were several factors including the coronavirus pandemic, but \u201cthe biggest scourge in Hong Kong comes from within\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt can be said the forces of black violence are destroying the foundation of Hong Kong\u2019s prosperity and stability,\u201d the statement said.</p> <p>It said the central government had responsibility for safeguarding national security and the constitutional order in Hong Kong, and called for the urgent implementation of long-shelved national security laws.</p> <p>As Hong Kong relaxes strict Covid-19 pandemic measures, some protests have started again, mostly small groups of people gathering in shopping malls to sing.

It would coincide with VE Day. Maybe Spitfires would roar. There would certainly be bunting.</p> <p>With a lack of foresight that has come to define them, the government didn\u2019t tell stationery manufacturers in time \u2013 the consequent <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/business/may-bank-holiday-2019-date-change-calendar-maker-change-calendars-cost-500406\">misprinted calendars and diaries</a> could become collectors\u2019 items, mementos of the kakistocracy, although with an estimated <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/28/brits-risk-booking-wrong-holidays-30-million-calendars-printing-error-11969518/\">30m</a> of them, it is unlikely they\u2019d ever be worth very much.</p> <p>Overtaken by recent events, VE-cheerleaders have tried to spruce the commemorations with topical, socially distanced detail: a schedule of activities has spread across social media: 11am, two-minute silence on your doorstep; 3pm, watch Churchill on the BBC; 4pm tea and scones; 9pm, nationwide singalong to We\u2019ll Meet Again.</p> <p>Others object to the shonky history of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/ve-day-commemorations-scaled-down\">celebrating VE Day</a> at all, the papering over of war\u2019s brutal realities. What I find nauseating is this whole package of Britishness, the Vera Lynn/double-decker bus/phonebox imagery that is both exceptionalist (we make the best patriotic singalongs, the most internationally recognisable obsolete technology) and regressive. It invites us, always, to hark back to some indistinct point in the past when we were made of better stuff.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/hes-just-a-wonderful-man-how-captain-tom-became-a-superstar-fundraiser\">Captain Tom Moore</a> is the human shield of this way of thinking, since how could anyone object to him personally? He\u2019s such a stand-up guy. Yet this nostalgia was politically sly at the best of times \u2013 it attempts to leverage past glories to build a hierarchy of belonging in the present, a hierarchy that was always somewhat, if not entirely, based on race.</p> <p>Now, in the middle of this crisis, that vision of the past is acutely unhelpful. If we are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/millions-of-britons-clap-for-carers-on-coronavirus-frontline\">coming together as a nation</a> \u2013 which I think we are \u2013 we\u2019re coming together as the country we are right now. It is the country of Moore, and it is also the country of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/a-smiling-hero-tributes-pour-in-for-nurse-dead-at-36-from-covid-19\">Areema Nasreen</a>, of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/uk-doctors-coronavirus-deaths-highlight-crucial-role-bame-medics\">Habib Zaidi</a>, of <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/london/2020-04-27/fantastic-mother-and-nhs-worker-for-more-than-a-decade-dies-after-contracting-covid-19/\">Laura Tanner</a>, of the scores of NHS staff who have died saving others, of the millions risking infection to man the frontline of the battle happening today.</p> <p>We don\u2019t have to live on the borrowed symbolism of some imagined time when things were \u201csimpler\u201d (read, more monocultural). We have our own contemporary acts of heroism to celebrate. To stand for two minutes at 11am, mourning the fallen of yesteryear, without first a token of silent respect to the DHL guy, the binmen and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/28/when-something-happens-to-a-bus-driver-you-feel-quite-attached-to-them\">the bus drivers</a>, would be not so much insulting as ridiculous.</p> <p>Patriotism, when it has any nobility at all, isn\u2019t just nationalism in its Sunday best. It is a celebration of people willing to make sacrifices for their fellow citizens. Today, those acts of sacrifice are everywhere you look. The country worth celebrating is the one we\u2019re in now, with the people in it now, with the cultural and racial mix it is now. There was no time in the past when we were more British, more altruistic, more ourselves. All debate about who does and doesn\u2019t belong here, who\u2019s in and who\u2019s out, has been capsized.</p> <p>The Farage tendency would probably prefer to drop the concept of patriotism altogether than to see it transmogrify into this. But on the left, too, there is a deep suspicion of any sort of patriotism, as an idea too freighted with delusion, pomposity and violence to have any value \u2013 which debate was reignited last weekend, when Starmer said we should be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/30/labour-should-not-shy-away-from-patriotism-says-starmer\">\u201cproud of being patriotic\u201d</a>.</p> <p>If we zoom in on this argument, it comes down to compatriotism. We can feel sympathy toward those beyond our own borders, but we have a direct ability to act on these feelings for our fellow citizens through our territorially defined democracies. If something\u2019s going wrong, if poor decisions are being made and doubled down on, if there\u2019s no transparency, we all bear responsibility for that. Compatriotism turns us from bystanders to allies, from passive observers to active citizens able to demand change. Solidarity can manifest into real change.</p> <p>We can worry about a doctor overseas without PPE, but here in the UK we can act on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/29/inquests-nhs-staff-deaths-ppe-shortages\">lack of equipment for our NHS staff</a>. Going on Twitter to complain about PPE isn\u2019t sufficient; <a href=\"https://actionnetwork.org/letters/defend-the-tdl-10?source=direct_link&amp;fbclid=IwAR2MHbbE5Q1h-6P3XLrhq67KN2hVTydTDaflMDVbbSkPaYoSOdR5ePb10c0\">signing petitions</a> might help but isn\u2019t a recognised pillar of democracy. But these actions are part of a larger process, they shape our collective sympathies and later, when election day comes, we\u2019ll test our politicians against these beliefs. Did they treat the rest of us as compatriots?</p> <p>I can see that there are progressives who would never accept this, who would be much more comfortable fighting for ventilators in a far- flung country than PPE in Middlesbrough. These agendas don\u2019t have to obliterate each other to survive, but they do have to find some mutual respect. To write off all patriotism as nationalism, as exceptionalism, as a colonial hangover, is as nostalgic in its own way as fixating on Vera Lynn.</p> <p>So let\u2019s have our VE day, even while the concept of any bank holiday is slightly tragic, like celebrating Christmas in a trench. I can take or leave the scones, and the Churchillifying. I cannot ignore the merits of this place, reflected in what its people will to do keep it afloat.</p> <p>\u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Not a great lockdown movie, then. Probably better on the big screen \u2013 just like Twister.</p>",
  "<p>Christopher Thomas, a call center operator in Lawrence, Kansas, said his employer has been dismayingly slow to protect the center\u2019s more than 400 workers from Covid-19 \u2013 slow in making sure workers were at least 6ft apart, in getting them personal protective equipment and in assuring emergency sick leave.</p> <p>That dismay, Thomas explained, comes on top of long-festering anger over pay. His employer, a federal contractor named Maximus, has discussed reclassifying many workers in order to hold down their pay. Thomas and many co-workers have not received a raise for five years, he said. He makes $15.36 an hour after seven years on the job helping people from across the US apply for health insurance through the Obamacare marketplace.</p> <p>To Thomas\u2019s mind, there has been one positive outgrowth from all this dismay \u2013 far greater interest in unionizing. In the last four weeks, he said, membership has nearly tripled in a workplace committee that includes many union supporters and is calling for increased pay and benefits and more transparency on basic work issues.</p> <p>\u201cI support a union because I love what I do, and it would be nice to have better pay and benefits,\u201d said Thomas, 32, who supports efforts to unionize with the Communications Workers of America. \u201cIf we have a union, we will have more power to tell Maximus to stop throwing us bare bones.\u201d</p> <p>In recent weeks, there has been an extraordinary surge of anger and activism nationwide as workers have protested what they consider inadequate safety protections against Covid-19: at meatpacking plants, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/if-youre-sick-they-dont-care-pandemic-forces-food-service-to-review-its-policies\">McDonald\u2019s restaurants</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/07/amazon-warehouse-workers-coronavirus-safety\">Amazon warehouses,</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/us-bus-drivers-lack-life-saving-basic-protections-transit-worker-deaths-coronavirus\">bus depots</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/15/whole-food-protests-coronavirus-working-conditions-sickout\">grocery stores</a>. Labor leaders applaud the walkouts and sickouts, and many of them are asking whether this spike in activism can be converted long-term into increased organizing and unionization and somehow reverse labor\u2019s decades-long slide.</p> <p>The answer depends in part on how vigorously unions and other worker groups respond, but also on how successfully America\u2019s many anti-union corporations respond in quelling this new militancy and any push for unionization. Some prominent companies have responded aggressively \u2013 Amazon has fired four outspoken worker leaders, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/02/amazon-chris-smalls-smart-articulate-leaked-memo\">the leader of a walkout at its Staten Island warehouse</a>, while Trader Joe\u2019s CEO sent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/labor-unions-trader-joes-workers-coronavirus-us\">an anti-union letter</a> to all employees.</p> <p>Monica Harris, who handles calls about Medicare at a Maximus facility in Chester, Virginia, cited another obstacle to unionizing: social distancing. \u201cPeople are very interested in the union right now because we\u2019re being required to come in under bad conditions,\u201d Harris said, speaking last month. But she added: \u201cYou\u2019re not really able to get in one-on-one, face-to-face contact with people right now.\u201d Another impediment to expanding union support is that many Maximus employees are transitioning to work at home, although union organizers are increasingly using Zoom to speak with workers and even hold rallies.</p> <p>Covid-19 has already spurred new organizing. With the virus spreading and his grocery store getting more crowded, Ryan Hartson was growing worried about getting infected in his job as an Instacart in-store shopper in Chicago \u2013 he gathers fruits, vegetables and other groceries for customers. Hartson and several co-workers grew upset that Instacart hadn\u2019t given them a mask or other PPE, hadn\u2019t provided hazard pay and made it hard to get paid sick leave. So he joined <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/business/economy/coronavirus-instacart-amazon.html\">the nationwide Instacart strike on 30 March</a> involving in-store shoppers (whom Instacart considers employees) and Instacart food deliverers (Instacart says they are independent contractors). Federal law gives employees a right to unionize, but not independent contractors.</p> <p>At the time of the strike, \u201cI was already in the middle of trying to organize my store,\u201d Hartson said. Instacart shoppers at a Mariano\u2019s grocery store in Skokie, Illinois, voted 10-to-4 to unionize in February, becoming the nation\u2019s first Instacart workers to unionize. Hartson said Covid-19 gave added momentum to the effort at his store, and he was soon discussing unionization with Instacart workers in Austin, Boston, Miami and Orlando.</p> <p>\u201cThe pandemic led to the strike, and the strike led to this opportunity to organize workers all over this country,\u201d Hartson said. \u201cNo question the pandemic has opened up a whole new dynamic in the labor movement.\u201d</p> <p>Todd Crosby, organizing director for the United Food and Commercial Workers, said that with regard to Instacart\u2019s in-store shoppers and its delivery workers \u2013 who he says are misclassified as independent contractors \u2013 \u201cwe are building a real organization at the workplace to win collective bargaining rights.\u201d He added, \u201cIn some other places, like Whole Foods and Trader Joe\u2019s, we\u2019re working with activists to engage in rebellion and protest that may lead to a permanent organization and collective bargaining.\u201d</p> <p>Tom Smith, national organizing director for the communications workers union, said coronavirus-related activism was setting the stage for longer-term organizing. \u201cIt\u2019s changing people\u2019s calculus,\u201d he said. \u201cWorkers often sense they\u2019re taking a risk when they\u2019re acting collectively. But Covid-19 has turned some of that calculus on its ear. Yeah, maybe the boss will hold it against me. Maybe this will put my job in jeopardy. But I\u2019m not going to put my life or my newborn\u2019s life or my immuno-compromised parent\u2019s life in danger.\u201d</p> <p>Smith oversaw a conference call with 1,000 largely non-union workers about Covid-19 and near-term and longer-term steps. \u201cAll of this is leading folks to really step forward and take action,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will be the first workplace confrontation for tens of thousands of people.\u201d The result, he said, will be many new workplace leaders, groups and networks.</p> <p>Edan Alva, a Lyft driver in Alameda, California, helped organize recent protests to make sure Uber and Lyft drivers obtain unemployment benefits after many stopped driving because of a sharp drop-off in business and fears of infection. After those protests, California\u2019s governor, <a href=\"https://www.kqed.org/news/11812496/uber-and-lyft-arent-paying-for-drivers-unemployment-you-are-confirms-newsom\">Gavin Newsom, pledged to make unemployment benefits available to these drivers</a>, despite Uber\u2019s and Lyft\u2019s efforts to block such benefits.</p> <p>Alva, a leader of <a href=\"https://gigworkersrising.org/\">Gig Workers Rising</a>, hopes California\u2019s state legislature will give Uber and Lyft drivers a right to unionize, even though the Trump National Labor Relations Board has embraced Uber and Lyft\u2019s view that the drivers are independent contractors and shouldn\u2019t be allowed to unionize. \u201cOur No 1 goal is to organize and unionize,\u201d Alva said. \u201cDrivers are increasingly seeing that nothing prevents Uber and Lyft from taking what they want unless we have a union.\u201d</p> <p>Andrea Dehlendorf, co-executive director of United for Respect, a non-profit fighting for low-wage workers, predicts that Covid-19 will change how workers and the public view corporate America \u2013 and that that will in turn inspire more activism.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s been happening to working people in this country is like a frog in boiling water, where things get more dire and extreme, where there has been this slow burn of declining stability and voice, and this crisis turned up the heat and exposed just how unconscionably corporations treat workers in our economy and society,\u201d Dehlendorf said. \u201cThis is not just a momentary surge in reaction to this particular crisis. This crisis is exposing just how inhumanly corporations are treating workers in a way that working people are not going to accept again.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Not many actors are able to work from home, but for a group of women, filming has started on a drama series \u2013 in lockdown. Tamzin Outhwaite, one of the cast, is lucky that her partner is a director (although he is not used to shooting on an old iPhone). Her 11-year-old daughter is also helping with the camerawork. Is it weird acting in front of her children? She gives a throaty laugh. \u201cOf course it\u2019s weird.\u201d</p> <p>Outhwaite, still best known from her time in EastEnders, will star in Dun Breedin\u2019, a comedy-drama created by the actor Julie Graham about a group of women brought together in a menopause support group. Outhwaite plays Indie, a free spirit who is trying to get through the hormonal change \u201cwith yoga and breathing. Other characters are like: \u2018You need to get some HRT.\u2019\u201d As well as Graham, the other actors include Angela Griffin, Tracy Ann Oberman and Denise Welch (they are real-life friends), all filming their scenes from home to create 12 episodes, each just 10 minutes, to be shown on YouTube. The show aims to raise money for the Trussell Trust, the charity that organises <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2020/mar/17/how-to-help-food-banks-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak\">UK food banks</a>.</p> <p>The menopause, despite being a huge shift for many women, has traditionally been ignored, says Outhwaite, who turns 50 this year. \u201cIt\u2019s just not really documented and if it is, it\u2019s in health pamphlets, as opposed to drama and comedy,\u201d she says. Isn\u2019t it also because menopausal women are of the age when society, scandalously, traditionally starts to ignore them? \u201cAbsolutely, but the women I know of that age are some of the funniest people. The way that women deal with things at that age can be very comical. And a woman can still be sexy and going through her menopause.\u201d</p> <p>Outhwaite says she found the first few weeks of the coronavirus crisis \u201creally difficult\u201d, although she knows she is lucky to be at home in north London, with her partner, Tom Child, and children, and with daily glimpses of her father, who is self-isolating from his home \u2013 a cabin built for him at the bottom of her garden. In positive moments, she says: \u201cI think it will make us realise what really matters.\u201d For Outhwaite, that is family and a job she loves.</p> <p>Just before Covid-19 hit, Outhwaite was appearing in the Chekhov play, The Seagull, in the West End. They had only done a few previews before the theatres were shut, a week before the lockdown. \u201cWe don\u2019t know when we\u2019re going to kick off again, or if we kick off again. Whether people will go to the theatre. Personally, I can\u2019t wait to go back.\u201d</p> <p>Outhwaite began her career on the stage \u2013 doing several years of musical theatre. She then spent a couple of years working regularly with the playwright Alan Ayckbourn, becoming one of his favoured actors, and was subsequently cast in EastEnders. She joined the soap in 1998, thinking she would just stay for three months and that it wouldn\u2019t change her life much. \u201cI thought: \u2018This is just another acting job. It doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019ve made it, because then you\u2019ve got a whole heap of career to continue.\u2019\u201d Instead, she stayed for more than three years; by the time Mel Owen \u2013 no-nonsense, husky voiced, gorgeous \u2013 was written out in 2002, she had married first Ian Beale, then local criminal Steve Owen, been kidnapped and arrested for suspected drug smuggling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4ea166b5813fcc79cca76f11888c4a18c2b42d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4ea166b5813fcc79cca76f11888c4a18c2b42d7/0_0_2037_1371/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Outhwaite as Mel Owen and Martin Kemp as Steve Owen at their wedding in EastEnders.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Outhwaite as Mel Owen and Martin Kemp as Steve Owen at their wedding in EastEnders.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicky Johnston/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During that period, when EastEnders was bringing in more than 10 million viewers, soap stars were the main focus of tabloid attention in the way that reality stars are now. Outhwaite was in her late 20s when she joined the cast, so says she felt relatively able to cope with the sudden fame. Were there times when it got too much? \u201cOh, yeah, there were many times when on a Friday night you\u2019d get a phone call from the News of the World, or whatever, saying someone had tried to sell some story that was nonsense. It was a whole new world.\u201d She was regularly followed by paparazzi. \u201cThere\u2019s not a part of you that enjoys that. There is a feeling that you\u2019re being spied on. Then your job is not just being an actor, you feel like some sort of public figure, but at the same time I never thought that I wanted to moan about it.\u201d Her family and friends helped her keep perspective, she says. \u201cWhen you think everyone\u2019s reading nonsense about you, actually they\u2019re not, because everyone\u2019s busy with their own lives. But in your head it\u2019s blown out of proportion.\u201d</p> <p>It must be hard for an actor to decide (if they have a choice) to leave the security of a regular, high-profile job and try to make it in the wilds outside, knowing there is still a bit of snobbery about soap stars. For every <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/may/11/suranne-jones-bad-stuff-worked-gentleman-jack\">Suranne Jones</a>, there are dozens more who struggle to transfer their profile into other roles. Outhwaite already had her lead role as an army investigator in Red Cap, the BBC drama, lined up when she left and she says she didn\u2019t feel any anxiety about her career. The work has been steady ever since, including the BBC dramas Hotel Babylon and New Tricks, although she has been more likely to pop up in shows as a guest star than the lead. There have also been numerous theatre roles, including another Ayckbourn production and a triumphant turn in the musical Sweet Charity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"67f975f3cf57cc35ca9a497e233d5b8f17ef22c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67f975f3cf57cc35ca9a497e233d5b8f17ef22c8/0_124_2800_1680/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tamzin Outhwaite in Alan Ayckbourn\u2019s West End production of Sweet Charity.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tamzin Outhwaite in Alan Ayckbourn\u2019s West End production of Sweet Charity.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen I hit 40, there were fewer scripts coming in,\u201d she says. \u201cIt did feel like I wasn\u2019t playing the leads in things, but that\u2019s fine by me. I\u2019m an ensemble actor, I really like to be in a company. I\u2019m not desperate to have all of the responsibility on my shoulders. I haven\u2019t really got much to moan about.\u201d It was harder to leave EastEnders the second time, she admits (Mel returned to the square in 2018, and was killed off the following year), \u201cbecause you\u2019re older and you\u2019ve got kids and the security\u2019s actually quite lovely, it did feel different. I thought: \u2018I wonder how I\u2019m going to be able to move back into the acting world after this time round.\u2019 But it\u2019s been pretty nonstop. Until Covid.\u201d She had a \u201clovely TV job\u201d lined up that she\u2019s not allowed to talk about. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s ever going to happen, but fingers crossed it does.\u201d</p> <p>She says she only ever wanted to make a living from doing something she loved. \u201cTo go from job to job, that was success, that was enough for me. I wasn\u2019t desperate to play a lead at the National. I really wanted to be in Cats the musical and that was kind of it,\u201d she says with a laugh. It hadn\u2019t occurred to Outhwaite, who grew up in Ilford, east London, and whose father worked at a newspaper printing plant and drove a black cab, that acting could be a job. \u201cI didn\u2019t come from a showbizzy kind of family, or even an artistic family,\u201d she says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I started auditioning for performing arts schools when I was 15 and then I was like: \u2018Oh, people do this for a living\u2019.\u201d She says she never had a life plan. \u201cNo plan for career, family, anything. Otherwise, it\u2019s just disappointment, surely, because things don\u2019t ever really go to plan.\u201d</p> <p>Outhwaite\u2019s time in EastEnders, even if the peak was some 20 years ago, created an enduring interest in her private life \u2013 it helped, then and now, that she was glamorous and had famous friends, such as the Spice Girl Emma Bunton, the Appleton sisters from the group All Saints, and the actor and presenter Amanda Holden. These days, her Instagram account is full of pictures of this girl gang, an instant nostalgia trip for anyone who yearns for the 90s, as well as cuddly selfies of Outhwaite with her boyfriend.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"009237f586ebed2f3e769e999f3722ebf7aa6690\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/009237f586ebed2f3e769e999f3722ebf7aa6690/0_1_2089_1254/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Outhwaite in the lead role as an army investigator in Red Cap, 2003.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Outhwaite in the lead role as an army investigator in Red Cap, 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurie Sparham/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her divorce from the actor Tom Ellis in 2014 was fairly public, and now she is fielding questions about her two-year relationship with her boyfriend, who is 21 years younger than her. Such a gap is rarely a big deal when it\u2019s a man with a younger female partner, of course. \u201cWhereas you cannot read anything about me without it saying \u2018toyboy lover\u2019,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cA woman being very sure of what she wants or what she is in her life doesn\u2019t make her a cougar, because there are two people involved in this relationship. Not all men want younger women, that\u2019s another thing. When you find someone you connect with, what, because you\u2019re different ages you shouldn\u2019t do that?\u201d She says, and I can hear a wry smile in her voice, it\u2019s not as if their age gap has come as a shock to them, something they have only read about in the newspapers. \u201cWe have thought about this, we have talked about this.\u201d Has the interest put pressure on their relationship? No, she says. \u201cAt the beginning you think: \u2018Can we do this?\u2019 But the minute we became official and thought we\u2019re all right with it, then no one else\u2019s opinions matter, apart from my children.\u201d</p> <p>Other women in similar situations have contacted her to thank her for speaking about it, for normalising it. And it\u2019s not that unusual, she points out \u2013 among the cast of Dun Breedin\u2019, Graham and Welch also have much younger husbands. Outhwaite\u2019s character does, too. Never has the menopause looked so enjoyable. \u201cJulie and I always said we should put a tape recorder on [during] our evenings out and you\u2019d get some great dialogue. A lot of the stuff that comes out of [my friends\u2019 mouths] you think, if you had that in a script people would think it was far-fetched. What I love is that Julie has kept all that, the swearing and the gruesome stuff.\u201d The show, she says, is \u201cedgy, not worried about offending people. And I suppose that\u2019s one thing that comes with age; you\u2019re just so happy when you get to a place where you\u2019re comfortable in your own skin. That gets left out of an awful lot of [stories about] women of our age \u2013 you\u2019re comfortable enough not to worry about being judged.\u201d</p> <p><em>Dun Breedin\u2019 is available to view on YouTube and new episodes land every Thursday</em><br></p>",

  "<p>\u201cSuch a lot of our work is about social interaction. Especially in smaller libraries, we\u2019re sometimes the only ones people see in a week,\u201d says Carol Stump, chief librarian at Kirklees council in West Yorkshire. \u201cWe wanted to be sure that with libraries in lockdown, people could still access our services. And we felt they might be glad of a chat.\u201d</p> <p>Stump runs a team of 110 library staff. Many of them have been redeployed during the pandemic, but those still working for the library service are keeping in touch with local people, particularly those over 70. Calls help people feel less isolated, and library staff can check whether they have enough food and medical supplies, or need other support. One 90-year-old man, for example, was missing his regular trip to the library to read the local paper, but is now able to read it online. \u201cIt\u2019s gone down so well. People have been so grateful,\u201d says Stump.</p> <p>The sudden switch from a physical space to online has been challenging for staff and users, but has also highlighted the vital role of library services and the skills of staff.

  "<p>Two months after 17-year-old Ebere fell pregnant last year, she considered having an abortion. But she was told by a doctor that such a process \u2013 eight weeks into her pregnancy \u2013 could lead to complications. </p> <p>Going home to her parents after visiting the doctor wasn\u2019t an option for Ebere, who feared her strict father would beat her and shame her in their neighbourhood. The father of the baby had denied all responsibility and threatened to kill her if she ever tried to contact him again.<br><br>A nurse, who saw the troubled young girl sitting in the hospital, approached her to find out what was wrong. Ebere explained her situation and the nurse showed her a Facebook page of a man she said was a social worker who helped pregnant women in her position. She told her to call the phone number.<br><br>\u201cWhen I called and explained my situation, he asked me to meet him at a popular restaurant in town,\u201d says Ebere, speaking to the Guardian in her home city of Enugu, in south-eastern Nigeria. \u201cWhen we met, he offered to take me to his home and care for me until I gave birth, but only if I was willing to sell the baby to him.\u201d</p> <p>With no other options, Ebere accepted his offer. She moved in with the man without telling her family. For her, it was the best way to escape the trouble she\u2019d have faced had she returned home, and she could make some money at the same time. </p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even ask him what he wanted to do with my baby,\u201d Ebere says. \u201cAll I wanted was to get rid of the baby and take my money.\u201d</p> <p>After Ebere gave birth to a boy, the man she\u2019d been living with sold the baby to a married couple. He gave the young girl 70,000 naira (about \u00a3140). Ebere returned to her family, telling them she had been kidnapped by traffickers who took her to a remote village and forced her to work as a domestic slave before freeing her.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In some cases, the child passes through up to five buyers</p> <footer> <cite>Comfort Agboko, Naptip</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cEveryone felt sorry for me,\u201d says Ebere. \u201cMy parents wanted to inform the police but I convinced them not to do so by giving them the impression I didn\u2019t want to be reminded about the trauma of my captivity.\u201d</p> <p>Ebere is one of many young girls in south-eastern Nigeria that the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (<a href=\"https://www.naptip.gov.ng/\">Naptip</a>) says have been drawn into a lucrative trade in baby trafficking. According to the agency, girls involved in the trade are known as \u201csocial mothers\u201d. Impoverished young women with nowhere else to turn and who have no access to abortion or antenatal care are being targeted.</p> <p>Traffickers pose as social workers, offering help to pregnant women who need support. In reality, Naptip says they are frontmen and women in the business of selling babies to couples or to middlemen. They typically charge $1,500 (\u00a31,200) for a baby girl and $2,000 (\u00a31,600) for a boy.</p> <p>\u201cMany young girls are being impregnated by their boyfriends but because they don\u2019t want their families to know about their pregnancy, they meet baby sellers who hide them until they give birth,\u201d says Comfort Agboko, head of Naptip\u2019s south-east office. \u201cTheir babies are then sold by these baby sellers who only give them a token of maybe 50,000 naira (about \u00a3100).\u201d<br></p> <p>Stories of baby trading are not uncommon in Nigeria, where at least 10 children are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/jun/02/nigeria-baby-farm-raided-human-trafficking\">reportedly sold </a>across the country every day.

The majority of those trafficked are children of young women held captive until their babies are born and then released, their babies sold on. Naptip says cases involving social mothers are increasing in the region.</p> <p>\u201cBaby sellers see the business as a normal trade and that is why they act as if they are selling any other goods,\u201d says Agboko. \u201cIn some cases, the child passes through up to five buyers.\u201d</p> <p>Authorities have struggled to deal with human trafficking due to inadequate funding and a lack of cooperation between the police and Naptip.

  "<p>There is a particular danger in enthusing over a big book. Namely, of becoming one of those people found on university campuses everywhere, who extol the virtues of David Foster Wallace\u2019s Infinite Jest (\u201cThe footnotes really add another dimension to the narrative\u201d) or Proust (\u201cfor the sensory experience\u201d) or Thomas Pynchon (\u201cfor the radical deconstruction\u201d). Who really has the time or energy to sit through 1,000 pages if not to just prove something to themselves out of endurance, or as a warped marker of their intellect?</p> <p>For the record, I am a \u201cbig book guy\u201d. I have read Foster Wallace, Pynchon and some Proust. In my defence, most of those texts were read for university courses and while I found them to be complex, multifaceted and linguistically interesting, they could have done with some serious pruning. The only big book that I have read that makes any sense at its length is the one I wish more people would give a chance: Ducks, Newburyport by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/lucy-ellmann\">Lucy Ellmann</a>.</p> <p>On the surface, this 2019 Booker-shortlisted novel seems like the ur-text for any big book enthusiast: more than 1,000 pages of the internal monologue of a constantly-baking Ohioan housewife packed into a single sentence, broken up only by asides on the meandering journey of a wild lioness and her cubs, and the repeated phrase \u201cthe fact that\u201d. Surely, this is the difficult big book to end all others? The one you can flaunt for the rest of your life as a badge of honour for your intellectual strength and stamina?</p> <p>Yet, it is far less complicated and much more emotionally rich than that description makes it seem. The more you read, the more you realise it is a poetic masterpiece; a meandering text that gets about as close as you can to the real-time inner workings of a mind, zipping from parental worries to practical nuisances, paranoia and that all-important baking. As her lines rattle along from musical hooks to musings on pop culture, her children and the state of the world, it becomes a strangely soothing reading experience. Once you begin to skip over the many \u201cthe fact thats\u201d as sentence breaks, Ellmann\u2019s never-ending syntax starts to massage your mind into a gentle skimming of its significance. Before you know it, you\u2019re 400 pages in and you now have an intimate knowledge of Laura Ingalls Wilder\u2019s Little House on the Prairie novels, of the filmography of Meryl Streep \u2013 namely 2009\u2019s It\u2019s Complicated \u2013 a step-by-step guide to making cinnamon rolls, and a litany of statistics about US school shootings and gun-related fatalities.</p> <p>Crucially, Ellmann doesn\u2019t include this knowledge as a marker of her own intelligence or as a means of establishing a grand narrative. She is merely mixing the mundane and the profound as our own minds so often do. She puts forward a fierce argument against gun ownership and private healthcare in the US, and for the nuances and mundanity of motherhood, without needing to spell out a word of it. In this way, she does not fall victim to the perils of many big books, such as Dostoevsky\u2019s The Brothers Karamazov and Melville\u2019s Moby-Dick, where the central, symbolic premise is spelled out in a character\u2019s monologue or revelation. There is no big reveal here. There is no time for an epiphany in the information cascade of the internet \u2013 just the continual churn of facts and small realisations, while life takes its own ineffable course. And life needs its space to breathe and time to be explored and understood, which is why, despite its formidable length, this bookis the shortest it could be.

contact tracing app</a> on iPhones may not be recording all the data required if they don\u2019t have the app running in the foreground or they are using an older model phone, the government has admitted.</p> <p>More than 5.1 million Australians have downloaded and registered to use the app on iPhone and Android devices, and, while the Android version works while running in the background (ie, not open on the screen), the iPhone version works best when the app is open on the screen and the phone is unlocked.</p> <p>It works by exchanging Bluetooth handshakes with other users you\u2019re around and recording that interaction in case you test positive for coronavirus and state health officials then need to call those people to get tested.</p> <p>Randall Brugeaud, the head of the agency behind the app, the Digital Transformation Agency, told the Senate committee overseeing the government\u2019s Covid-19 response that while the iPhone version did work in the background, it was less effective in exchanging Bluetooth handshakes if it was is in the background or the screen was locked.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related:

Australia's Covidsafe compares to other countries' contact tracing technology</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhat we can say is the quality of the Bluetooth connectivity for phones that have the app installed running in the foreground is very good,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd it progressively deteriorates and the quality of the connection is not as good as you get to a point where the phone is locked in the app is running in the background.\u201d</p> <p>Another factor that would weaken the Bluetooth signal was if the phone was an older model of iPhone, he said.</p> <p>The government rolled out an update to the iPhone app this morning, and Brugeaud told the committee he hoped that a further update integrating framework developed by Google and Apple would fix the iPhone issue.</p> <p>Australia would be one of the first countries in the world to integrate the Google-Apple framework, he said.</p> <p>Brugeaud\u2019s admission came despite repeated claims from the government services minister, Stuart Robert, that the app worked.</p> <p>\u201cThe app runs either in the foreground or background,\u201d Robert told Guardian Australia on Monday.</p> <p>Brugeaud said the updates would be made in the next few weeks, and the app\u2019s source code would be released either towards the end of this week or early next week.</p> <p>Department of health acting secretary Caroline Edwards said the decision to allow the government to hold contact data for tracing rather than a more decentralised version like Germany is planning, where a user just gets a notification in their app, had been made to protect the more vulnerable people in society, who might be concerned about a text message out of the blue.</p> <p>\u201cThe person who does make contact with the person who may have been in contact with the person who\u2019s diagnosed is a trained professional able to advise them on what they should do and provide support,\u201d she said.</p> <h2>Amazon has been paid $700,000 to host data</h2> <p>Amazon Web Services has been paid more than $700,000 to host the data for the app, it was revealed on Wednesday.</p> <p>Registration data is hosted in AWS servers in Australia, and data on contacts for the past 21 days is held on each users\u2019 phone until they consent to it being uploaded to AWS servers for the purpose of contact tracing in the event they test positive for coronavirus.</p> <p>There has been concern about whether, because Amazon is a US company, that the data could be handed over to the US government under the Cloud Act or another law, despite the data being held in Australia.</p> <p>Edwards and Attorney-General\u2019s Department deputy secretary, Sarah Chidgey, could not give a \u201c100% guarantee\u201d that the data would not be accessed by US law enforcement but said they were extremely satisfied, based on legal advice from the Australian government solicitor, that the legislative guarantees and the operation of US law would mean it was extremely unlikely that data would be so accessed.</p> <p>\u201cI can give a guarantee that it is a criminal offence under Australian law,\u201d Chidgey said. \u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable that that situation would happen.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

For one season only, we wore a black and white shirt, in tribute to the original Dale top of 1908. It proved so popular that the following season, we incorporated it into the regular dark blue kit, adopting the Internazionale-esque blue-and-black-striped shirt that we still sport to this day.\u201d</p> <p>Aidan Watts-Fawkes rounds things off down under. \u201cMelbourne Heart were an A-League expansion club for the 2010-11 season and wore red-and-white stripes as the home kit for their first four years. But the takeover of the club by City Football Group in 2014 prompted a change to a white Manchester City template jersey (2014-15, 2015-16) and then the City sky blue. The red-and-white stripes has remained as the away jersey for all but two seasons since and is the third kit this season. It\u2019s much-loved by fans and many, me included, want it back as our home kit. With the two Melbourne clubs playing in the same stadium, the red and white was a point of difference to Melbourne Victory\u2019s navy blue. But now we\u2019re sky blue and treated as an arm of a global football conglomerate. In a city which prides itself on its individuality, becoming Manchester City Lite was a slap in the face.\u201d</p> <h2>Knowledge archive</h2> <p><strong>\u201cPeter Crouch and Dimitar Berbatov are exactly the same age, both born on 30 January 1981,\u201d</strong> noted Matthew Page in January 2007. <strong>\u201cIf the suggested transfer of Crouch to Spurs goes through, will this be the first such occurrence of a strike partnership being exactly the same age?\u201d</strong></p> <p>Not quite, Matthew.

  "<p>Russia stepped decisively off a path of western-led global integration on the morning of 25 October 2003. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/26/mikhail-khodorkovsky-life-after-prison-russia-after-putin\">Mikhail Khodorkovsky</a>, the country\u2019s richest man and the chief shareholder in its largest energy company, Yukos, had touched down to refuel his private jet in Novosibirsk when Russian Federal Security Service commandos forced their way on to the aircraft and arrested him on trumped up charges of fraud and tax evasion. Khodorkovsky was swiftly remanded in Moscow\u2019s notorious Matrosskaya Tishina jail while the Kremlin put the finishing touches on a show trial that would see the oligarch sentenced to nine years in a Siberian prison.</p> <p>Khodorkovsky was no saint: he had amassed a vast fortune during the chaotic and corrupt privatisations of the Yeltsin years while most of the country was reduced to poverty, and few mourned his downfall. But the unceremonious seizure and dismemberment of his business empire by a shadowy clique of men surrounding the president Vladimir Putin ushered in a disturbing new era in Russian politics. The Kremlin\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/28/russia-order-pay-50bn-yukos-shareholders-khodorkovsky-court\">destruction of Yukos </a>forms the central chapter in Catherine Belton\u2019s fearless and fascinating account of the emergence of the Putin regime from the ashes of the Soviet Union.</p> <p>A renowned business journalist who spent years covering Russia for the Financial Times, Belton follows the money. She has an unrivalled command of the labyrinthine history of share schemes, refinancing packages, mergers, shell companies, and offshore accounts that lay bare the stealthy capture of the post-Soviet economy and state institutions by a coterie of former KGB officers, or <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/20/west-putin-russia-spymaster-spies-ukraine-us\">siloviki</a></em>. Belton combines this financial history with testimony from a dazzling array of Kremlin insiders, diplomats, intelligence officers, prosecutors, mobsters and oligarchs. The result reads at times like a John le Carr\u00e9 novel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a785f73bba14fcdd76f819e9df89c20ba3f44c1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a785f73bba14fcdd76f819e9df89c20ba3f44c1d/0_0_1436_2200/653.jpg\" alt=\"Putin with Angela Merkel at the Dostoyevsky Monument in Dresden, 2006.\" width=\"653\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Putin with Angela Merkel at the Dostoyevsky Monument in Dresden, 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Sinyakov/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hazy invocations of Putin\u2019s KGB past have become something of a journalistic cliche. Belton, however, gives a granular account of Putin\u2019s early years as an agent in Dresden not simply as an ominous feature of his biography but as the seedbed of the regime over which he would preside. Like Putin, the <em>siloviki</em> who came to form his inner circle cut their teeth in the KGB\u2019s clandestine operations in the final years of the cold war. They learned sophisticated techniques for washing money through fake companies abroad in order to finance Kremlin-friendly political movements and developed illicit networks for smuggling sanctioned western technology back into the Soviet Union. They sowed disinformation to discredit western leaders, perfected the use of <em>kompromat</em> to blackmail businessmen and officials and forged alliances with terrorist groups and organised crime. Updated for an era of globalisation and the internet, this toolkit now supports the Kremlin\u2019s grip on power at home and its long political reach abroad.</p> <p>Yet Putin does not emerge from these pages as an evil, cat-stroking mastermind plotting his moves years in advance. Rather he appears an unscrupulous and resourceful operator, ready to deploy any weapon, break any rule and subvert any system to consolidate his power, wealth and international prestige. The <em>siloviki</em> worked things out as they went along. As the Soviet Union began to unravel, they siphoned off vast sums from the dwindling economy to ensure the survival of their networks at home and abroad. The 1990s saw them shut out of power as pro-western oligarchs such as Khodorkovsky held sway in the Kremlin. But they bided their time, and they plotted.</p> <p>Although he is often portrayed as the \u201caccidental president\u201d, Putin\u2019s rise to the presidency did not have \u201cmuch to do with chance\u201d. In 1999, the <em>siloviki</em> launched a coordinated attack on Yeltsin\u2019s \u201cfamily\u201d of relatives, advisers and oligarchs, leaking damaging evidence of corruption to prosecutors at home and abroad. Mired in scandal and fearful of an old guard restoration led by former communists, the family cast around for a biddable figure to replace the ailing and erratic president and protect their interests. The Kremlin\u2019s fixer-in-chief Sergei Pugachev pushed his protege Putin, who had proved himself an effective bureaucrat and whose principal charm lay in the fact that \u201che was as obedient as a dog\u201d. Turning a blind eye to Putin\u2019s own background in the security services, the family anointed him prime minister in August 1999 and then, when Yeltsin abruptly resigned on the eve of the new millennium, president of the Russian Federation. Fearing a \u201ccoup by forces from the communist past, what the Yeltsin family had in fact succumbed to,\u201d Belton writes, \u201cwas a creeping coup by the security men.\u201d The fox was in the hen house.</p> <p>With their man now installed in the Kremlin, the <em>siloviki</em> began \u201cto carve up the country\u2019s strategic assets for themselves\u201d. They targeted one company after another, probing weaknesses and exploiting the chequered past of every businessman who had made a fortune in the chaos of the preceding decade. They saw the role of state institutions \u2013 the tax office, law enforcement, the judiciary \u2013 not as upholding certain rules by which all economic actors had to operate, but rather as a \u201cpredatory machine\u201d that could be used to destroy rivals and seize their assets.</p> <p>Under Putin, the <em>siloviki</em> have amassed a vast slush fund that serves both personal avarice and geopolitical strategy. The soaring fortunes of Putin\u2019s inner circle, glimpsed in the revelations of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/03/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-panama-papers\">Panama Papers,</a> are indistinguishable from the vast off-the-books war chest that the Kremlin draws on to finance its subterfuge and interventions abroad. And if there is an ideological glue that binds the <em>siloviki</em> together, it is their dream of a restoration of Moscow\u2019s imperial might and the conviction that the west is out to get Russia. The revolutions in Georgia and Ukraine of 2004-5 fed Putin\u2019s \u201cdark paranoia\u201d that the Kremlin was threatened by a western plot to topple his regime. The Kremlin has subsequently revelled in escalating conflicts with the western powers as a marker of Russia\u2019s newly regained stature on the world stage. At home, a slavish media celebrates Russian military exploits in Ukraine and Syria, while abroad, the Kremlin\u2019s media networks spew a stream of innuendo and obfuscation that creates mistrust in western governments and institutions.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Western banks have laundered the Kremlin\u2019s money and allowed it to penetrate into the economies of Europe and the US</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the same time, Putin\u2019s regime has held up an unflattering mirror to the west. Belton shows how western governments that preach the rule of the law, free markets and respect for private property have turned a blind eye to the plunder of Russian businesses by the Kremlin and its allies. Western companies have rushed to sign new deals that legitimised the proceeds of these corporate raids; western banks have laundered the Kremlin\u2019s money and allowed it to penetrate into the economies of Europe and the US; western political parties and institutions have shown themselves ready to accept donations of dirty Russian money. \u201cIt looks like the whole of US politics is for sale,\u201d one former senior Russian banker tells Belton. \u201cWe believed in western values \u2026 But it turned out everything depended on money, and all these values were pure hypocrisy.\u201d</p> <p>A groundbreaking and meticulously researched anatomy of the Putin regime, Belton\u2019s book shines a light on the pernicious threats Russian money and influence now pose to the west. Deepening social inequality and the rise of populist movements in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis have \u201cleft the west wide open to Russia\u2019s aggressive new tactics of fuelling the far right and the far left\u201d. Kremlin largesse has funded political parties across the continent, from the National Front in France to Jobbik in Hungary and the Five Star movement in Italy, which are united in their hostility to both the EU and Nato. The Kremlin\u2019s \u201cblack cash\u201d, former Kremlin insider<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/23/russian-banker-loses-9m-london-home-in-legal-fight-with-moscow\"> Sergei Pugachev</a> laments, \u201cis like a dirty atomic bomb.

My concern is that if I rebook for next year it will be very hard to get affordable travel health insurance, especially as my wife has asthma.

Do you have any advice on future availability, price and likely exclusions of travel health insurance?</strong></p> <p><em><strong>BS, Amersham, Buckinghamshire</strong></em></p> <p>No one knows the answer to that yet. A best guess is that few policies will cover pandemics and that premiums will rise. It\u2019s estimated that the pandemic will cost travel insurance providers nearly \u00a3300m in cancellation payouts and industry insiders predict a price rise of about 10%. \u201cWe can\u2019t say at the moment what will be available on the market and when, especially for someone with a pre-existing medical condition,\u201d the Association of British Insurers explains. \u201cTravel insurance is a competitive market and will seek to help customers as the situation becomes clearer over the coming months, but there is currently no guarantee that a suitable policy would be available to this reader when they need it. With or without the EHIC, travel insurance is still necessary to ensure access to emergency medical treatment.\u201d</p> <p>You\u2019ve highlighted a crucial concern about the travel industry\u2019s insistence on credit notes or vouchers instead of refunds. For cancelled flights and package holidays this is illegal. Under EU law, airlines should refund the cost of a cancelled trip within seven days and Package Travel Regulations require holiday operators to refund within 14 days. Firms, with the sanction of their trade body ABTA, are holding out in hopes the government will relax the rules to save the industry from meltdown. However, credit notes and vouchers may not be protected if the company goes bust before you can use them. You should therefore insist on a refund so you can be flexible about future travel plans. According to Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, the future impact of the pandemic on travel insurance could be severe. \u201cThis leaves many who have upcoming trips in a very difficult situation,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you have already accepted a postponement or credit, contact your travel insurer as they may be able to transfer your existing cover to the new dates and destinations.\u201d</p> <p><em>If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer.co.uk.

Overall, they routinely contribute more than \u00a31m every day to NHS causes.</p> \n<p>While they all stress that they are supplementing taxpayer funding, and paying for extras rather than for basics such as personal protective equipment (PPE) for health workers or ventilators for patients during the current crisis, the ground rules are not as clear as is commonly supposed. An <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/291844/summary-report-final-301012.pdf\">official review</a> in 2012 concluded that \u201cthere is no hard and fast rule that charities must not subsidise or replace public services\u201d.</p> \n<p>Orton\u2019s organisation \u2013 itself a charity \u2013 was established in 2009 as the Association of NHS Charities, although founding members had been meeting informally since 2000 to swap campaign ideas and good practice.

She mentions groceries, toiletries and even tablet computers, while examples on NHSCT\u2019s website include grant recipient <a href=\"https://leeds-cares.org/\">Leeds Cares</a>, which is using cash to enable hospital patients to have free TV and phone calls that would otherwise cost up to \u00a37 a day for the bedside service, and the <a href=\"https://maudsleycharity.org/\">Maudsley Charity</a>, which has bought games and activities for young patients on the Maudsley hospital\u2019s mental health wards and in the community in south London.</p> \n<p>A second tranche of funds will go to supporting what she calls \u201cwider partnerships\u201d.

Many will need continuing psychological help, she says, and some who have contracted the virus may be unable to return to work or volunteering for a considerable time. But she stresses that this will ultimately benefit all of us. \u201cThe point of NHS charities is that the beneficiary is the patient,\u201d she says. \u201cFunds can go to staff, because that enables them to support the patient to the best of their ability.\u201d</p> \n<p>Orton and her team have been working round the clock since deciding to launch the appeal. A sub-group of NHSCT\u2019s governing board is meeting, online, twice weekly to ensure money is going out to member charities as swiftly as possible. All the staff, who include temporary paid workers but also volunteers furloughed from member charities that have suspended their own activities, are working remotely away from the organisation\u2019s offices in Warwick.</p> \n<p>This way of working is familiar to Orton, who previously built a team of 26 working entirely remotely when she ran the <a href=\"https://www.joneggingtrust.org.uk/\">Jon Egging Trust</a>, a youth charity. Her background is in youth work, but she says she has always specialised in partnership building across agencies and sectors. When she earlier worked in the faith sector, she spent time in South Africa where she adopted the philosophy of Ubuntu, or humanity, which she translates into her management style as: \u201cI need you to be the best that you can be so that I can be the best that I can be.\u201d</p> \n<p>Looking ahead, she agrees that things will never be the same again for NHSCT. Almost overnight, its brand has been established as the national focus of giving to the NHS as a UK-wide entity and its scale has exploded: in 2019-20, she says, its income was about \u00a3400,000; this year, it is heading fast towards \u00a3150m.</p> \n<p>While that figure will inevitably fall back sharply after the crisis, Orton can surely be confident of it staying in the tens of millions. But she is keeping her feet firmly on the ground. \u201cThe reality is I am not a frontline member of NHS staff working 12 or 14 hours a day in PPE kit,\u201d she says. \u201cUnderstanding just how difficult that can be gives me some perspective about where I and the organisation fit in to all this.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Curriculum vitae</h2> \n<p><strong>Age</strong>: 45.</p> \n<p><strong>Lives:</strong> Warwickshire.</p> \n<p><strong>Family:</strong> Married, three children.</p> \n<p><strong>Education:</strong> St Joseph\u2019s Convent School, Kenilworth; Oxford Brookes University (BA youth and community studies with applied theology).</p> \n<p><strong>Career:</strong> 2018-present: chief executive, NHS Charities Together; 2018: interim chief executive, Kairos Women Working Together; 2014-2017: head of youth programmes, then interim chief executive, Jon Egging Trust; 2004-14: youth and community worker, Warwickshire council; 1994-2004: youth and community worker, Church of England.</p> \n<p><strong>Interests:</strong> Running, hiking, camping, Sunday family film. </p>",
  "<h2>Top story: Professor quits Sage after breaking rules</h2> \n<p>Hello, Warren Murray with you at the midpoint of another week in lockdown.</p> \n<p>Youth unemployment in Britain will reach the 1 million mark over the coming year unless the government provides job guarantees or incentives for school leavers and graduates to stay on in education, the Resolution Foundation warns. In the absence of action an extra 600,000 people under the age of 25 will swell dole queues with a risk of long-term damage to their career and pay prospects, it predicts.

Treasury is understood to be examining several options including cutting the 80% subsidy to 60% and lowering the \u00a32,500 cap on monthly payments. Another option promoted by employers\u2019 groups would be to let furloughed staff work, with a smaller state subsidy.

Cafes, restaurants and retailers are expected to be among the first to be allowed to reopen. Hong Kong is to reopen schools, cinemas, bars and beauty parlours from Friday, with all 7.5 million residents to be given reusable face masks.

  "<p>The neon lights of the 80s, a predominantly female cast, diversity in spades, and women who are fed up with patriarchy? For all of these reasons, I was ready to fall in love with Glow when it was first released in 2017. And yet I struggled to sink into the story, primarily because of the heavy focus on central player Ruth Wilder (Alison Brie), a self-centred aspiring actress, who has, very unsympathetically, betrayed her best friend Debbie Eagan (played to perfection by Betty Gilpin).</p> <p>But a combination of Covid and kismet led me to try again. Now up to its third season, the reviews were (ahem) glowing to say the least. And this time I found myself easily drawn in, enjoying the slow burn of a story loosely based on 1980s women\u2019s wrestling in the US.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/01/younger-shrewd-take-on-millennial-publishing-ticks-the-romcom-boxes-too\">Younger: shrewd take on millennial publishing ticks the romcom boxes too</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The show, helmed by Carly Mensch and Liz Flahive (between them Nurse Jackie, Weeds and Orange is the New Black), introduces us to the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling (the eponymous Glow), who initially seem little more than a ragtag assembly of wannabe actresses. They are led by fatigued and uninspired director Sam Sylvia (Marc Maron), who attempts to direct the women like they are in one of his \u201ccult\u201d horror films. But producer Bash (Chris Lowell) has other ideas: wrestling is over-the-top and outrageous. It\u2019s a playground and you can be a character in the ring \u2013 so long as you play to the audience\u2019s desires.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c7eef97832d21aedd47875c3534a69986aa0628\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c7eef97832d21aedd47875c3534a69986aa0628/0_101_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alison Brie, Bashir Salahuddin, and Betty Gilpin in the first season of GLOW.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alison Brie, Bashir Salahuddin and Betty Gilpin in the first season of Glow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erica Parise/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Things become cleverly and humorously grotesque as Bash ushers the inexperienced wrestlers into offensive stereotypes: the Asian Jenny is Fortune Cookie; Tamm\u00e9, who is black and gregarious, is forced into playing Welfare Queen; and Arthie, an unassuming, quiet Indian girl, becomes an Arab terrorist, gun and all. She meekly protests that it\u2019s offensive, and well, she\u2019s not Arab, but who\u2019s going to know the difference?</p> <p>The wrestlers, as in life, come in different shapes and sizes, and carry with them an assortment of troubles, burdens and dreams. But the wrestling audience is not interested in a sincere experience: they want an explosion of the dramas they expect from \u201cdiverse\u201d people. Whatever their external appearances suggest to the world will be amplified, heightened and mocked in order to deliver an irreverent display of female wrestling. And the characters are painfully aware of it, conflicted because they have found a creative frequency that feels right and true, but for which they must demean themselves to some extent in order to participate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96ba4649736d3746fa5d6b9514d573e24bff2b25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96ba4649736d3746fa5d6b9514d573e24bff2b25/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"a group shot of the characters in glow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My costume still smells like beer and racism.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beth Dubber/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Arab terrorist gets booed off stage, literally pounded by beer cans (later prompting one of the best lines in the show from Arthie who, holding up her outfit, laments, \u201cMy costume still smells like beer and racism\u201d). Meanwhile, Tamm\u00e9 braves her way through the degrading welfare stereotype, even when her son, whom she painstakingly helped get into an elite university, watches, heartbroken, and admits to his mother that it felt like a minstrel show.</p> <p>Soon the women become united in an essential way, with even Ruth becoming more useful to a group who initially shunned her for her self-importance \u2013 and for sleeping with Debbie\u2019s husband. The broken friendship is played out in the ring as Ruth accepts ambitious Debbie\u2019s sickly sweet, all-American Liberty Bell\u2019s triumph over her character Zoya the Destroya, a Russian who thrives on being hated. Ruth just wants to act and has no problem being the enemy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d0962a1097fa11994d2c7121cb17aa8f8a336db4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0962a1097fa11994d2c7121cb17aa8f8a336db4/0_164_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ruth (right) just wants to act and has no problem being the enemy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ruth (right) just wants to act and has no problem being the enemy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ali Goldstein/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the greatest challenges of managing diversity on-screen is to do it effortlessly, and deliver nuanced, authentic portrayals. We are at once asked to accept that race, sexuality and anything that separates us from mainstream norms should not matter, while at the same time to lean into these very aspects of ourselves and perform them. Glow subverts this in a clever way; it capitalises on stereotypes, is rambunctious about them, but admits, eventually, that staying quiet about the effects of blending in is really in service to the majority who gets to decide when and how our difference matters. This includes the demands of womanhood. Debbie struggles with competing interests. She loves her son, but she\u2019s not free. Similarly, Cherry Bang (Sydelle Noel), who presents an empowered black witch on stage, quietly admits to her husband that she doesn\u2019t want to give up her body and life to a baby.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/30/netflixs-samurai-gourmet-hypnotically-dreamy-show-makes-kitchens-feel-like-neverland\">Netflix\u2019s Samurai Gourmet: hypnotically dreamy show makes kitchens feel like Neverland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s not what you expect from a show that, at first blush, with its painstakingly recreated big hair and bright makeup, seems to be gunning for easy laughs. Moreover, it\u2019s challenging to meet today\u2019s woman with her 1980s counterpart, who may be aware of barriers to freedom and success but exists within much tighter boundaries.</p> <p>Glow is proof that TV can be diverse without being about diversity; that you can narrow in on people\u2019s lives, accept the unique influences and the specific dilemmas that present themselves (racism, sexism and homophobia, to name just a few), and offer intelligent stories rich with vibrant and relatable characters.</p> <p><em>\u2022 GLOW is available to stream in Australia on Netflix</em></p>",

  "<p>Andrew Constance says he pulled out of contesting the Eden-Monaro by-election for the Liberals because he had not signed up to be smeared in a federal contest.</p> <p>Constance shocked colleagues by pulling out of the contest in the ultra-marginal seat the day after he\u2019d pledge to run. The New South Wales transport minister confirmed his intentions in a statement, which acknowledged his about-face would confound people. \u201cI appreciate people will be confused by my actions over the past couple of days, and for that I am sorry.\u201d</p> <p>He then told reporters he\u2019d pulled out after reading a front page story in the Daily Telegraph, where his colleague John Barilaro, who also had designs on the seat, had reportedly called him a \u201ccunt\u201d in private conversations.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I said politics is stuffed in this country, and some of the people in it need to have a long hard look, I meant it,\u201d Constance said Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re now seeing that in such a great way on the front page of the Telegraph.

While it wasn\u2019t ideal, there was a simple joy in being in it together.</p> <p>When it was my turn my girls worked together, one combing with a reassuring running commentary, and the other squirting the treatment on. It should have been grim, like the memory of the nit nurse, but it was surprisingly relaxing.</p> <p>I never expected a day that started with an itchy head to end like this. My girls took great care in their work and, more than anything, I felt loved.</p>"
