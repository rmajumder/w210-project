  "<p>The Department of Homeland Security has come out strongly against internet voting in new draft guidelines, breaking with its longstanding reluctance to formally weigh in on the controversial issue, even after the 2016 Russian election hacking efforts. The move comes as a number of states push to expand the use of ballots cast online.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/08/coronavirus-us-live-trump-michael-flynn-california-new-york-reopen-cuomo-latest-news-updates\">Trump says he's 'learned a lot from Richard Nixon' during Fox interview \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/460491458/CISA-Guidelines-on-Internet-Voting\">The eight-page document, obtained by the Guardian</a>, pulls no punches in calling the casting of ballots over the internet a \u201chigh-risk\u201d endeavor that would allow attackers to alter votes and results \u201cat scale\u201d and compromise the integrity of elections. The guidelines advise states to avoid it altogether or restrict it to voters who have no other means of casting a ballot.</p> <p>The document primarily addresses a type of internet voting called electronic ballot delivery and return \u2013 where digital absentee ballots that counties send to voters overseas via email or a web portal are completed and returned via email attachment, fax or direct upload \u2013 but it essentially applies to all forms of internet voting. No states currently offer full-on internet voting, but numerous states allow military and civilian voters abroad to receive and return ballots electronically, and some of these voters use an internet-based system that allows them to mark their ballot online before printing it out and mailing it back or returning it via email or fax.</p> <p>The DHS considers electronic ballot delivery a low-risk endeavor compared with electronic ballot return, but both can be compromised. In 2018, a hacker at the Defcon hacking conference in Las Vegas demonstrated that he could alter a ballot transmitted via email without detection.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"internet voting\">  <iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" title=\"CISA Guidelines on Internet Voting\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/460499510/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&access_key=key-sUxNzyfMOfiug3yKqqra\" data-auto-height=\"true\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.7729220222793488\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s not clear how many voters receive and return ballots electronically. In 2016, states sent more than 930,000 absentee ballots to overseas voters, according to a survey conducted by the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), and about 633,000 completed ballots were returned. But not all states reported how many were sent or returned electronically.</p> <p>Government-accountability group Common Cause calculated that at least 100,000 ballots were returned via fax or the internet in 2016 in states that provided this data. But 16 states that allow the return of ballots via fax, email or online portal did not answer the survey question.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>States should not be rolling the dice with our democracy by using insecure technology</p> <footer> <cite>Ron Wyden</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Amid the pandemic, Democratic senators Amy Klobuchar and Ron Wyden have introduced legislation that would give all voters the option of casting absentee ballots by mail under certain conditions and also let them request and obtain their ballot online if their county fails to mail it in a timely manner. Though the senators oppose electronic ballot return, states could feel pressured into allowing this for all voters if election and postal workers are unable to process the increased number of mailed ballots.</p> <p>Wyden praised the department for laying out the risks of electronic ballot return in the guidelines. \u201cStates should not be rolling the dice with our democracy by using insecure technology, including email, to receive electronic marked ballots over the internet.\u201d</p> <p>The guidelines were prepared by the DHS\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa), which has been working since 2016 to assess and secure election infrastructure. A source familiar with the matter told the Guardian that Matt Masterson, a former election official and current senior cybersecurity adviser at the agency, launched the effort to develop the strong guidelines, with the support of Chris Krebs, Cisa\u2019s director. The guidelines were co-developed with the National Institute of Standards and Technology and other federal agencies, though only Cisa\u2019s name is on the version of the guidelines the Guardian obtained.</p> <p>States are required under federal law to have the ability to transmit digital ballots to military and overseas voters if these voters are unable to receive a mailed ballot in time before elections.</p> <p>The DHS guidelines state that electronic distribution of digital ballots carries a low risk on its own \u2013 an attacker could intercept ballots and remove candidate names or races. But there are more serious risks from marking ballots online and the most \u201csignificant security risks\u201d come with electronic ballot return.</p> <p>Voters are supposed to print out the electronic ballots and fill them by hand before mailing them back or creating a PDF or other image to return them electronically. But if the voter fills out the ballot online or on their computer, an attacker could alter it before the voter prints it out, which could go unnoticed if the voter doesn\u2019t review their printed ballot. An attacker could also intercept emailed or faxed ballots to alter or prevent them from being cast.</p> <p>Election integrity activists are applauding the new guidelines.</p> <p>\u201cClear, explicit guidance from DHS that internet voting is not secure or trustworthy is long, long overdue,\u201d says Susan Greenhalgh, the senior adviser on election security for the watchdog group Free Speech For People. \u201cIt has failed for four years to codify and publish that guidance in an effort to avoid antagonizing some state officials.\u201d</p> <p>But it\u2019s not clear if the DHS plans to make the guidelines, currently marked \u201cfor official use only\u201d, public or keep them in their present form. </p> <p>Privately, individual DHS officials have long agreed with computer security experts that internet voting is dangerous.</p> <p>Neil Jenkins, the former director of the DHS\u2019s Office of Cybersecurity and Communications, told the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/magazine/election-security-crisis-midterms.html\">New York Times magazine</a> that when his office convened a call with election officials in 2016 after Russian hacking efforts became known, their sole intent was to warn election officials against internet voting.</p> <p>\u201cWe were going to tell them that internet voting wasn\u2019t safe, and it was a risk factor and you need to not do it,\u201d he said. But that message never got delivered once DHS realized internet voting was only being done on a small scale. </p> <p>A 2018 analysis by Common Cause and others found that the DHS, the EAC and other federal election officials failed to address the issue in written guidance given to states or even provide any recommendations for securing computers that receive ballots over the internet.</p> <p>The source with knowledge of how the guidelines were developed said the new DHS stance is encouraging. \u201cI think it\u2019s hopefully the beginning of a much stronger federal policy on insecure voting tech.\u201d</p> <p>Washington state\u2019s secretary of state, Kim Wyman, said she welcomed the DHS guidelines. Wyman has been a critic of internet voting for years and has tried unsuccessfully to get her state legislators to alter a law that allows Washington\u2019s overseas voters to return their ballots electronically. </p> <p>\u201cWe need to make sure that we have public confidence in that election [in November]. It\u2019s not whether or not the merits of electronic ballot return are good or bad, it\u2019s: are people going to believe the results that come out of that voting?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Leaked audio recordings and online materials obtained by the Guardian reveal that one of the most prominent anti-lockdown protest groups, American Revolution 2.0 (AR2), has received extensive assistance from well-established far-right actors, some with extremist connections.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/michigan-protests-coronavirus-lockdown-armed-capitol\">Armed protesters demonstrate against Covid-19 lockdown at Michigan capitol</a> </p> </aside>  <p>AR2 presents itself as a grassroots network, but the recordings and other materials reveal its allies include a well-connected Tea Party co-founder and a family of serial online activists who have rolled out dozens of \u201creopen\u201d websites and Facebook groups.</p> <p>Its website was built and is hosted by a web designer long active in far-right circles online, and who runs a bespoke social media network for the militia movement.

In videos posted to YouTube, the AR2 website, and across anti-lockdown Facebook groups, Ellis has presented the movement as inclusive and bipartisan, and himself as a conservative everyman.</p> <p>In the most <a href=\"http://archive.is/xCd2v\">widely watched video</a>, Ellis, who runs a home-repair business in suburban Chicago, describes himself as \u201can average American citizen\u201d, concerned to \u201cdefend what America was founded on and what America is about\u201d.</p> <p>But in recordings of Ellis speaking to an inner circle of AR2 members last week, he detailed the help he had received from other players, including radical pro-gun and militia activists.</p> <p>Ellis told the group, whose Facebook profile picture is the logo of the Three Percent militia, that in recent days he had \u201ctalked to the Dorr brothers\u201d. </p> <p>The Dorr brothers \u2013 Chris, Ben, Aaron and Matthew \u2013 are rightwing activists whose methods have been <a href=\"https://www.mnscammersexposed.com/blog/\">roundly criticized</a> by conservative groups and legislators.</p> <p>The Dorr brothers have orchestrated online campaigns which stake out positions to the right of established pro-gun groups such as the NRA, and state-based right-to-life groups. The campaigns then encourage rank-and-file conservatives to donate money and sign petitions on websites that harvest their data.</p> <p>An<a href=\"https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/reopen-domains-shut-the-front-dorr\"> analysis</a> in late April by internet security researchers found hundreds of \u201creopen\u201d related domains had been registered during that month; that scores could be connected to the Dorr brothers; and that \u201cFacebook groups spun up by the Dorr brothers use these groups to direct traffic to these domains\u201d.</p> <p>Some of these sites acted as major hubs for disinformation about the pandemic, and many were suspended by Facebook. But the Guardian was able to establish that as of Monday, at least 20 \u201creopen\u201d or \u201cAmerican Revolution 2\u201d pages for cities and states including Virginia, Florida and Los Angeles were running as private groups.</p> <p>The pages viewed by the Guardian featured content promoting \u201cdeep state\u201d or anti-China conspiracy theories, anti-vaccination beliefs and denialism about the danger of Covid-19. Some, such as \u201cReopenNC\u201d, had tens of thousands of members.</p> <p>Aaron Dorr did not respond to requests for comment about his relationship with AR2.</p> <p>In a telephone conversation, Ellis confirmed the contact, saying that in advance of the 1 May anti-lockdown protests, he did \u201ctalk to one of the Dorr brothers early on, asking them to help spread the word\u201d.</p> <p>Asked if he had initiated contact, Ellis said: \u201cOne of our members did, and then [the Dorrs] reached out to me.\u201d</p> <p>In a subsequent call, Ellis confirmed the authenticity of the audio recording.</p> <p>In the recording, Ellis specified further help he had received, telling his inner circle: \u201cOne of the Utah guys got me hooked up with the owner of mymilitia.com.\u201d</p> <p>According to internet registration records and My Militia\u2019s affiliated Facebook group, the owner of the mymilitia.com domain is Chad Embrey of New Lexington, Ohio.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Pages viewed by the Guardian featured content promoting 'deep state' or anti-China conspiracy theories</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p> According to DNS records and two website \u201cmanifestos\u201d archived on mymilitia.com, Embrey has registered at least 20 domains related to the militia movement like \u201cmilitiaregistry.com\u201d, gun rights like \u201cprogungroup.com\u201d or specific militia groups like \u201ciiiers.com\u201d, a reference to the Three Percent militia.</p> <p>My Militia offers a catalog of existing militias and promotes a program for setting up a militia for every telephone area code.</p> <p>The site\u2019s extensive library of PDFs includes a Canadian army manual on ambushes, a guide to destroying tanks, and a treatise outlining justifications and strategies for an insurgency in the US.

My mother had put her tiara on for the occasion, so we asked my parents if we could go out and see for ourselves. I remember we were terrified of being recognized,<br></p> \n  <p>So I pulled my uniform cap well down over my eyes.\u201d</p> \n  <p>She added: \u201cWe cheered the king and queen on the balcony and then walked miles through the streets.

I had recently returned to my grandfather\u2019s empty villa in the city of Lodz, after nearly six years on the run. I come from a Jewish family, and all of my immediate relatives died in the Holocaust. I only survived because I escaped from a train bound for Treblinka, after which I joined the Polish resistance. We fought the Germans in Warsaw, but after they were defeated the Soviets occupied our country and they were arresting and executing Polish home army officers. It was also the time that I realised that my family, for whom I had been waiting in Lodz, wasn\u2019t going to come home.</p> \n   <p>While the rest of Europe celebrated, we were in hiding. We already knew for a few months that the war would end soon, but that it would not bring us any great joy. It was just another grey day, the end of years of suffering, but no freedom. I\u2019m not sure that everyone in Poland felt the same way as us, but we did see substantial collaboration with the new regime. </p> \n   <p>For me, VE Day meant the end of one horror and the beginning of another that I didn\u2019t want to be a part of. After the war I left Europe and moved to what would become Israel. I know it marks a great achievement, but for the last 75 years I have never celebrated this day and I doubt I ever will - the part of me that remains strongly Polish does not allow me to do so.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-08T10:23:42.487Z\">at 11.23am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb52ca08f08464cd42967bf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/daniel-boffey\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-08T10:11:44.192Z\">11.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A 98-year-old RAF veteran has completed a 2.2-mile walk in Belgium to raise funds for a much-loved soldiers\u2019 club in the Flemish town of Poperinge.<br><br>George Sutherland, the son of a Belgian mother and Scottish father, escaped to Britain when the Germans invaded Belgium in 1940.</p> \n  <p>He walked from Lijssenthoek commonwealth war cemetery in Poperinge to Talbot House, a clubhouse for all the ranks founded in 1915 but which is facing financial ruin because of the coronavirus lockdown.<br></p> \n  <p>Sutherland had a police escort and was accompanied by a pipe major from the memorial bagpipe band of the Church of our Lady in Poperinge.

  "<p>Covid-19 has reshaped geographic boundaries. It has left many financially distressed. Expatriates have returned from overseas for indefinite periods of time, and vulnerable people require more help than usual. For all these reasons, and many more, adult children have found themselves doing something that might previously have been unthinkable: moving back in with their parents.</p> <p>Some are finding the experience transformative. One woman, who left New York for her parent\u2019s rural home, told me that the space and country air have made her reconsider whether she will ever return to the city. But there are also downsides. \u201cI\u2019m craving male attention more than I ever have before,\u201d she confessed. When flirting over apps stopped cutting it, she wound up ordering a vibrator in an unmarked box, and fended off her younger siblings in order to retrieve it from the mailbox.</p> <p>While some families are redrawing the household rules they grew up with, other adults are finding themselves slipping back into adolescence. Here, four people in very different circumstances share their stories.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I realise this is a very valuable time\u2019 \u2013 Franki Birrell</strong></h2> <p>In December my mother broke her hip. She had an operation, and heart attack after that. She got gangrene in her toes, and she had to go back to the hospital to have them off. She spent three months in hospital. All that transpired just before her 101st birthday, which was the 17th of March.</p> <p>I came here knowing I could get stuck, but at the same time wanting to ensure she had everything in place. I was not really sure what was happening with the coronavirus at that point, because no one was.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"01752a72b421e5740227e050eee170d928210d24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01752a72b421e5740227e050eee170d928210d24/0_98_2448_1740/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Franki Birrell and her mother at home together.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"711\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Franki Birrell and her mother at home together.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Franki Birrell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was very concerned about setting up the services that she would need, and just being here for her. She was pretty vulnerable at that point. We weren\u2019t sure whether she was going to survive any of this, and she has. She\u2019s gotten stronger.</p> <p>I must admit the first week I was very teary, when I realised I probably wasn\u2019t going to get home. It was difficult for her too, because she had to become used to not being quite as in control of things. But after that first week, having the nurses coming less and less, it\u2019s really been very good.</p> <p>We just live day by day and we live very happily most of the time. It\u2019s not so much a routine \u2013 I do the shopping, but she\u2019s very very self-sufficient. We just flow with it.

The last two years, when he was really gravely ill, were very difficult. He died last September. This was thrown at me a couple of months later, so the grieving process has been disrupted. But I feel stronger. He was a brilliant man, and we had a wonderful life together. I listen to a lot of podcasts now, and it reminds me of the intellectual conversations I used to have with my husband.</p> <p>I\u2019ve well and truly left my teenage stage behind, and I\u2019m quite grateful for that. It would be quite terrible if I was here, and my mother was running after me, like she keeps promising to do. She keeps saying to me, \u2018Well I should be doing something for you.\u2019 It probably would have been very confronting if I\u2019d done this forty years ago.

You basically just sleep there. I moved back in with my mother temporarily right before Christmas. I was planning to move out again when the World Health Organisation declared a pandemic.

I\u2019d been inside for two weeks already, so I was pretty tense. No one washed their hands. It was really messy. Some guests had just got back from overseas. People were sharing food with their hands. I remember muttering to my mum: \u201cWell we\u2019re all dead\u201d. Some people are not taking this situation seriously enough.

I\u2019m not a stranger, I\u2019m your mother.\u2019 It\u2019s endearing but also reflects a cultural dynamic that I think other families don\u2019t really have, in terms of how parents relate to their kids when they\u2019re back home.</p> <p>In some ways it\u2019s been like becoming a teenager again.

  "<h2>Lucy Prebble: \u2018Theatre is genuinely therapeutic\u2019</h2> <p>A play in its conception is, for me, uniquely intimate and private. Eventually it grows to be the opposite of that and blossoms outwards, but there\u2019s something about building it that initially feels delicate, fragile and personal. I think that might have something to do with my childhood; listening to conversations and writing things down, and that being the start of me thinking about plays.</p> <p>TV feels a lot less private and there\u2019s a part of me that\u2019s very in control and adult and managerial with it. I won\u2019t do any TV unless I\u2019m exec producing as well, like I was in Succession. That means you\u2019re involved in all the major decisions: casting, locations and lots of practical things, which I\u2019d never be that interested in when writing for theatre. If I go to a television meeting I\u2019m more armoured. In theatre I feel much more of a pure artist.</p> <p>The creative processes are very different, practically and psychologically. In theatre, a bunch of people come together, discuss a play, then rehearse and perform it in real time. That\u2019s a very sane thing to do. Filming TV is actually quite insane. It\u2019s very easy to see how you can get lost and confused in a world where everything is fake, and you repeat the same thing over and over again. Whereas I think theatre is quite a healthy process. You have a narrative that you explore, which you then go through every night. It\u2019s genuinely therapeutic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bb453c7da850795abba4eab175cc96c7a04282f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb453c7da850795abba4eab175cc96c7a04282f6/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Enron by Lucy Prebble at the No\u00ebl Coward theatre, London, in 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enron by Lucy Prebble at the No\u00ebl Coward theatre, London, in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My favourite moment in theatre is the tech. I find it very romantic. You\u2019ve got all these people sitting in the dark, for 10- or 14-hour days, trying to build this thing. Nobody is at the centre of things. Everything is egoless. There\u2019s you, the director and the designer, sitting in the middle of an empty theatre and staring at the stage. At that point, all possibilities are available.</p> <h2>Vinay Patel: \u2018You can make almost anything happen\u2019</h2> <p>I came to theatre quite late. I did a master\u2019s in writing and had massive arguments with my coursemates; I just didn\u2019t see the point in theatre. But then I wrote my first play to try to push myself. The way that it made my brain work \u2013 the fact I could make almost anything happen \u2013 there was real delight in that.</p> <p>I never have to feel self-conscious writing for the theatre. When I did <a href=\"https://www.bushtheatre.co.uk/event/an-adventure/\">An Adventure</a> at the Bush in 2018, the play spanned 60 years and three continents. There\u2019s no way I\u2019d get that on telly. What\u2019s great about theatre is that you can start with ambitious storytelling right from the off. Theatre is a little space where you can dream a little bigger.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92bc7274f1f947900c69d4e595d84f04a3602080\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92bc7274f1f947900c69d4e595d84f04a3602080/0_0_4491_3162/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anjana Vasan and Martins Imhangbe in An Adventure by Vinay Patel at the Bush theatre, London, in 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"704\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anjana Vasan and Martins Imhangbe in An Adventure by Vinay Patel at the Bush theatre, London, in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Telly is led by the audience in a way that theatre isn\u2019t necessarily. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03nnns9\">Murdered By My Father</a> was a BBC Three commission. I knew the audience would be relatively young, so I had to write a story I could place in front of them. <a href=\"https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2018-11-23/doctor-who-series-11-diversity-bame-actors-writers-vinay-patel-episode-6-demons-of-the-punjab/\">Doctor Who</a> was a similar experience. That\u2019s meant to be a family show, which obviously affects the type of stories you can tell. You have to try to find the family-friendly way to explore the partition of India while still being truthful.</p> <p>When you go to watch a play, you tend to be someone who is vaguely interested in theatre \u2013 whereas people can quite casually catch things on TV. With Murdered By My Father, an imam from Bradford talked about how he used it to talk to his congregation, and a sixtysomething woman from Cornwall sent me a letter saying the show reminded her of her dad. That kind of reach is amazing but it\u2019s also scary, and inherently more intense. The responsibility feels much higher when you\u2019re writing for TV.</p> <p>Theatre is so much about potential. It\u2019s most fulfilling when it\u2019s really playful. I love the sort of theatre that makes me smile without realising it: the shows that are silly and reach beyond themselves, just because they know they can.</p> <h2>Rachel De-lahay: \u2018It feels more like your baby\u2019</h2> <p>Theatre is a dark room, with a spotlight, that you get to tell a story in. That feels really easy and tangible. Telly stuff feels more formulaic. It\u2019s really fun when you nail it, but definitely a different rhythm.</p> <p>The difference between them isn\u2019t really about the dialogue. It\u2019s about the rhythm of the text, and what those scenes are supposed to do to an audience. So if I need you to feel engaged with someone \u2013 and I need you to hear what\u2019s going on in their head \u2013 that could potentially come out in a chunky piece of dialogue in the theatre. You go on a journey with the actor and you watch them on stage kind of cracking through the thought. In telly a lot of that can be done with facial expressions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c5b3d8427e9caa4823d7bc8d48533d522e8b741\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c5b3d8427e9caa4823d7bc8d48533d522e8b741/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fiston Barek and Calvin Demba in Routes by Rachel De-lahay at the Royal Court theatre, London, in 2013\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fiston Barek and Calvin Demba in Routes by Rachel De-lahay at the Royal Court theatre, London, in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In both theatre and television you want to work with people who can help tell the best story with you. I\u2019ve just worked on <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p082w992\">Noughts and Crosses</a>, and I was 100% pushing theatre people forward and suggesting names. You\u2019ve seen actors who telly people might not have heard of play lead roles in small theatres and shine. It feels like you\u2019re part of a community because everyone\u2019s pulling each other up. </p> <p>You do go on set when you\u2019re a writer for TV but I\u2019m don\u2019t sit with the director day in, day out, like I would be in a theatre rehearsal. In theatre, it just feels more like your baby. Although when I was working on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/10/kiri-review-beautifully-observed-drama-and-not-as-grim-as-expected\">Kiri</a>, I got to watch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/sarah-lancashire\">Sarah Lancashire</a> deliver a monologue I\u2019d just written \u2013 that felt magic.</p> <h2>Jack Thorne: \u2018When a play hits, there\u2019s a real hush\u2019</h2> <p>I tend to write the impossible into a play when I\u2019m enjoying it. The first play I did with John Tiffany and Steven Hoggett was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/jun/09/let-right-one-in-review\">Let the Right One In</a>. I started it with someone running through a forest, being strung up by their ankles and having their throat cut open. I wrote that knowing it wouldn\u2019t be possible to replicate but that Steven and John would do something very interesting with that stage direction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9823b69bf51d27c76a667a7619c8329db220d6bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9823b69bf51d27c76a667a7619c8329db220d6bb/0_0_3949_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Quinn and Rebecca Benson in Let the Right One In at the Royal Court theatre, London, in 2013\" width=\"1000\" height=\"717\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martin Quinn and Rebecca Benson in Let the Right One In at the Royal Court theatre, London, in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Telly can be like that, too. With <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/national-treasure\">National Treasure</a>, I wrote a 16-page scene. That\u2019s not how telly works, but you throw down the gauntlet and say: let\u2019s see what you can do to sustain this. With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/03/tv-tonight-the-peerless-autumn-escapism-of-his-dark-materials\">His Dark Materials</a>, I kept saying to myself: remember, you\u2019ve got to take a nine-year-old with you. If this show works, the most exciting thing will be when the telly is switched off and a family talk about what happened. That\u2019s the thing I try to keep in my head all the time: what am I setting up that sofa conversation to be?</p> <p>Theatre\u2019s a bit similar in that you\u2019re thinking about the bar chat afterwards, but it\u2019s also much more about an unspoken communication with the audience. It\u2019s about getting rid of the rustle and it\u2019s about people sitting forward. Everyone knows when a play is really hitting because the audience suddenly becomes very quiet, stops eating their sweets (except maybe on Broadway), and suddenly there\u2019s a real sort of hush. You\u2019re always striving for that lean-forward moment in theatre.</p>",

Both are welcome, but do not go far enough.</p> <p>\u201cIt will take time for people to recover from this crisis and they need all the support we can give them to prevent what would be an unprecedented and devastating spike in homelessness.</p> <p>\u201cIn the long term we need to fix the housing crisis \u2013 with stronger rent regulations and much more affordable and social housing \u2013 so that everyone has a home that is safe, secure, environmentally sustainable, and that they can afford to live in. What we need right now is an emergency package to set us on that path.\u201d</p> <p>Labour\u2019s five-point plan calls for an extension to the temporary ban on evictions for six months or however long is needed to implement the legal changes.</p> <p>They are also asking the government to bring forward its proposal to scrap section 21 \u201cno-fault\u201d evictions and outlaw evictions on the grounds of rent arrears if the arrears were accrued because of hardship caused by the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>Once evictions are prevented, they would like ministers to grant renters at least two years to pay back any arrears accrued during this period.</p> <p>Residential tenants should be given the same protections as commercial tenants, to prevent them being made bankrupt by their landlords for non-payment of rent.</p> <p>Labour also wants to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/23/universal-credit-system-will-not-change-under-pandemic-mps-told\">quicker management of universal credit claims</a> and for the government to consider a temporary increase to the local housing allowance available to certain renters. It was raised once already in April.</p> <p>Under the Coronavirus Act 2020, most landlords will not be able to start possession proceedings unless they have given their tenants three months\u2019 notice.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: \u201cEmergency legislation is now in place so no renter can be forced out of their home during this difficult time \u2013 landlords cannot evict for at least three months. We will keep this under review and can extend if necessary.</p> <p>\u201cWe are also supporting business to continue paying their staff, investing \u00a37bn in the welfare system and increasing local housing allowance, which will help tenants pay their rent.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Thousands of people around the world are jogging to celebrate the birthday of man they never knew \u2013 Ahmaud Arbery. It is part of a global campaign to pay homage to 25-year-old Arbery, nicknamed Maud, who was shot and killed by two white men while out jogging in Georgia. Ahmaud was born on 8 May 1994 and would have turned 26 on Friday.</p> <p>The idea for a global run in Arbery\u2019s name came from his high school football coach, Jason Vaughn, who last saw Arbery when they crossed paths on a run. Arbery loved running. Now, the hashtag #IRunWithMaud has travelled the world, with runners from London to New York completing the 2.23-mile trip \u2013 a tribute to the date of his death, which occurred on 23 February. The hashtag now has more than <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/irunwithmaud/\">60,000 posts on Instagram</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/VAeducatorRJW/status/1258744510047293441\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hand on my heart \u2764\ufe0f \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe this morning. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/irunwithmaud?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#irunwithmaud</a> \ud83d\udc51 <a href=\"https://t.co/YtjhggoaxD\">pic.twitter.com/YtjhggoaxD</a></p>&mdash; Rashard J.

Gregory and Travis McMichael told officers they thought Arbery resembled a suspect in a series of nearby break-ins. The pair were charged with murder and aggravated assault.</p> <p>Police were aware of the crime for more than two months but did not charge the McMichaels until after the shooting gained widespread attention.

For those that know me know I hate all things cardio and I got bad knees lol but I did it for Ahmaud. I didn\u2019t know the young king the was murdered in cold blood but it resonated with me heavy. Maybe because I think of how that could have been my brother or cousin .Maybe it\u2019s the ample amount of times I have felt uncomfortable in my life for being one of the few black families in my community and the stares that accompanied that when we moved in. Or the times where I\u2019ve been followed in the store because I looked \u201cthreatening\u201d and could possibly steal. or maybe the time where I was pulled over for a headlight being out and was told to get out of my car with my hands where the officer could see them. Or maybe that one time I was traveling with my family and a restaurant blatantly refused to serve us, I wish I could make this up y\u2019all \u2022 I\u2019ve been traumatized before by my own fathers tragic death. This was triggering. I\u2019m not sure how to not stop thinking about this young man. But maybe I\u2019m not supposed to. As a someone training to be a physician I feel it is my obligation to advocate for those without a voice. And with this platform I plan on doing that. There is power in numbers. Ahmaud Arbery this is for you. I\u2019m praying this brings people to realize racism has never gone away. We don\u2019t talk about these issues to \u201cbring up the past\u201d . It is very much our present day. Microaggressions and bigotry are thriving in this country. It is not invisible. #justiceforahmaud #irunwithmaud</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden;

NHS England figures show 12 deaths so far for hospital patients aged 0 to 19 who had tested positive. Some nine, including the baby, had a pre-existing health condition, while three did not. The total death toll in the UK, among patients who have tested positive for Covid-19 now stands at 31,241 - 1,072 more than Italy\u2019s total of 30,201. </p> \n  <p><strong>Government misses 100,000 testing target for sixth day</strong></p> \n  <p>For the sixth day in a row the government missed its target of testing 100,000 people for coronavirus. Despite a rise of more than 10,000 on the previous day, the level reach was 97,029. Defending the figure, the environment secretary, George Eustice said: \u201cThe important thing is to have those ambitious targets you\u2019re working to, to just continually build the capacity.\u201d He claimed the prime minister\u2019s new target of 200,000 tests per day by the end of the May, was for capacity rather than tests carried out. He said: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s announced in the last week that we\u2019re going to ramp that up further to 200,000 tests capacity per day.\u201d </p> \n  <p><strong>Plea to open fast food outlets but \u2018no dramatic change in lockdown\u2019</strong></p> \n  <p>Eustice has urged more takeaway food outlets to reopen. He said: \u201cWe never mandated that they should close.\u201d He also said: \u201cMcDonalds drive through was made for social distancing.\u201d But he confirmed there would be no \u201cdramatic overnight change\u201d in the lockdown rules on Sunday. </p> \n  <p><strong>UK scientists\u2019 fury over attempt to censor Covid-19 advice</strong></p> \n  <p>Government scientific advisers are furious at what they see as an attempt to censor their advice on government proposals during the Covid-19 lockdown by heavily redacting an official report before it was released to the public, the Guardian can reveal. The report was one of a series of documents published by Sage this week to mollify growing criticism about the lack of transparency over the advice given to ministers responding to the coronavirus. However large blocks of text in the report, produced by SPI-B, the Sage subcommittee providing advice from behavioural scientists on how the public might respond to lockdown measures, were entirely blanked out.</p> \n  <p><strong>Wales unveils modest easing of the lockdown</strong></p> \n  <p>The first minister, Mark Drakeford, says it is too soon to ease the lockdown in Wales but announced three modest adjustments.</p> \n  <ol> \n   <li>Local exercise will be allowed more than once a day.</li> \n   <li>Garden centres will be opened with physical distancing measures.<br></li> \n   <li>Local authorities will open libraries and recycling centres.</li> \n  </ol> \n  <p>Schools will not be opened at the start of June, Drakeford confirmed. He also revealed the R number in Wales is estimated to be 0.8 and if it stays at that level 800 people will die in Wales by August. If it increases to 1.1 an estimated 7,200 will die in Wales.</p> \n  <p><strong>Sturgeon warns against easing the lockdown</strong></p> \n  <p>Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said she was only considering relaxing the restrictions on exercising, saying the R number in Scotland was too close to 1 to contemplate any other easing measures. She also announced a further 49 deaths in Scotland taking its death toll to 1,811. She said: \u201cBy easing restrictions prematurely we would risk undoing all the progress that we\u2019ve made, we would risk allowing the virus to spread out of control and that would cost lives.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Rail services set to increase</strong></p> \n  <p>Plans to ramp up rail services have been brought forward by a week and will start from next Monday, a union is claiming. Services were expected to be increased gradually from 18 May as part of an easing of the economic lockdown.

coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <p>Staff at the Florence Nightingale Museum in Westminster said her key nursing values \u2013 which focused on maintaining good hygiene, regularly washing hands and carrying out evidence-based practices \u2013 had been widely echoed over the past months.</p> \n  <p>Nightingale was born on 12 May 1820 and Tuesday also marks International Nurses Day.</p> \n  <p>She developed these habits during the Crimean war, where, along with a small troupe of nurses, she tended soldiers\u2019 wounds and worked to improve hospital conditions.</p> \n  <p>Her data-based work also helped shape modern nursing: founding the nursing school at St Thomas\u2019 hospital, developing palliative care and midwifery, and shaping the redesign of hospitals across the UK and the health system itself.</p> \n  <p>Kristin Buhnemann, assistant director at the Florence Nightingale Museum, said: \u201cIn terms of modern nursing, her legacy has never been so relevant, as she was a pioneer for sanitation, hygiene and had a monumental impact on infection control today.\u201d</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"301dce49ae6acd15b4110e359409b0a71a5e28de\"> \n

We locked down on 23-24 March. </p> \n  <p>\u201cSo I really worry that if we come out of this too quickly, maybe two or weeks too quickly we could see the flare-up of a second wave and so I would say keep it in place until the end of May, to the beginning of June. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe danger both economic and the toll in deaths danger is so great.

  "<p>Garden centres are preparing for a surge in plant and flower sales that could help salvage a catastrophic year for the horticulture industry.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s 2,000 garden centres and nurseries were forced to close in March because, unlike DIY chains such as B&amp;Q and Homebase, they were not granted \u201cessential\u201d retailer status. The shutdown came at a critical time of year, with 70% of sales rung up in spring, forcing <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52098436\">devastated growers</a> to throw away millions of plants.</p> <p>The Welsh government\u2019s decision on Friday to allow stores to reopen has raised hopes that the rest of UK will be close behind. The green light could not come too soon for the industry, which has been pleading or a \u00a3250m state aid package to avoid collapse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/08/gardens-bloom-under-lockdown-with-record-demand-for-seeds\">Gardens bloom under lockdown with record demand for seeds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Brett Avery, managing director of West Sussex grower Far Plants said it had lost about \u00a35m worth of stock due to the coronavirus lockdown: \u201cFor us the key three weekends in the season would be the Easter weekend, which we\u2019ve missed, this bank holiday, which obviously we\u2019ve missed, and then the end of May bank holiday weekend. If there is a relaxation and we can capitalise on that last bank holiday that would be fantastic. Even when they reopen we are probably looking at 50% of normal sales capacity [because of] the rules for people to get in and out.\u201d</p> <p>James Barnes, chairman of the Horticultural Trades Association (HTA), said the country\u2019s 23 million gardeners were itching to get down to their local store to buy plants and other gardening paraphernalia.</p> <p>\u201cWe know there will be a huge surge in demand. We would ask customers not to rush to retailers and buy more than they need.\u201d</p> <p>The HTA has helped garden centres come up with new, safe ways to operate. They are expected to control crowds by reducing the number of parking spaces available and putting limits on the number of shoppers in store \u2013 its recommendation is one person per 1,000 sq ft. Cafes, restaurants and children\u2019s play areas would remain closed with Barnes asking shoppers to be \u201cpatient\u201d as retailers operated within the restrictions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6e3330600fde62fea03e7c8c724bf9bc0d0e55f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6e3330600fde62fea03e7c8c724bf9bc0d0e55f/0_179_5420_3255/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers tend to flowers and plants in the glasshouse at Sandiacre Nursery near Guildford, southern England.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Workers tend to flowers and plants in the glasshouse at Sandiacre Nursery near Guildford, southern England.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Asked about the Welsh government\u2019s announcement, Boris Johnson\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cThe prime minister will be setting out the next steps on Sunday. I would just stress again that any easements that we do make will be very limited, and that we will be taking a very cautious approach.\u201d</p> <p>Natalie Porter, a sales manager at the family-run Happy Plants, in Formby, Merseyside, which supplies plants to garden centres, said the firm had to throw away \u00a3180,000 worth of stock in the first week of the lockdown \u2013 more than the company usually makes in annual profits.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s our absolute prime time,\u201d said Porter of the key spring months. \u201cThis happened when we should have been getting a lot of plants out of the door and replacing those with more.\u201d</p> <p>The supplier usually moves 8m plants between March and June but even after selling online and making deliveries it has only made about 1% of its usual sales.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, there is likely to be a shortage of stock because growers have not been planting at their usual pace. Happy Plants decided to take a gamble by planting some fresh stock last month, anticipating a change in policy. \u201cWe missed three whole weeks of planting, you can\u2019t really catch that up,\u201d Porter said. \u201cSo if garden centres do reopen, they would be going into it with a third less stock than usual.\u201d</p> <p>The HTA said that while allowing garden centres to reopen was good news for hundreds of growers, the shutdown would leave lasting scars. In contrast, their Dutch counterparts have received a \u20ac600m (\u00a3524m) government bailout.</p> <p>Barnes said: \u201cThe damage has already been done to our industry, as garden centres have been closed during the annual peak period for plant sales. The only way to rescue this sector now is for the UK government to pursue a simple Dutch-style compensation scheme, which will help save our horticultural industry.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>For every athlete across every sport there will be a level of anxiety right now regarding a return to action post-lockdown. When will it be? What will it look like? Why, exactly, will it be taking place? But among those from black and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds the sense of unease is likely to be especially acute given the way in which Covid-19 is ravaging their communities.</p> <p>The numbers are stark. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/british-bame-covid-19-death-rate-more-than-twice-that-of-whites\" title=\"\">NHS England figures</a> published last month showed that hospital deaths per 100,000 among British people of a black Caribbean background were three times the equivalent number in the white population, while analysis carried out by the Institute for Fiscal Studies soon after found the death rate among British black Africans and British Pakistanis in English hospitals to be more than 2.5 times that of the white population.</p> <p>On Thursday the Office for National Statistics published a report which provided further evidence that people from ethnic groups are at a \u201csignificantly higher\u201d risk of dying from coronavirus than people of white ethnicity \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds\" title=\"\">four times as high in the case of black people</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/07/football-coronavirus-this-could-be-the-end-of-grassroots-game-change-non-league\">Football and coronavirus: 'This could be the end of the grassroots game'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A range of variables are at play here, from health inequalities to socio-economic and cultural factors, but there remains shock and an overall lack of clarity as to why people from BAME backgrounds are being so disproportionately affected. The government has launched an inquiry while medics across the country \u2013 including at Birmingham NHS trust \u2013 are carrying out their own investigations. But there are no guarantees of findings, let alone solutions, and as such it is little wonder BAME athletes are worried about resuming the day job anytime soon.</p> <p>This appears to be the case in football in particular, which is no surprise given how diverse the sport is in the UK \u2013 about a third of Premier League players are from a BAME background, with similar figures in the lower leagues. Emile Heskey spoke for at least some when he said last week that he would be \u201c100% concerned\u201d about returning to action were he still playing. \u201cMy grandad passed away two years ago and he had diabetes, high blood pressure,\u201d the former Leicester, Liverpool and England forward, who is of Antiguan descent, said. \u201cMy eldest kids are sickle cell trait. Are they at risk as well? These are the problems we have.\u201d</p> <p>Jobi McAnuff is a BAME player who shares Heskey\u2019s concerns. The Leyton Orient midfielder said: \u201cYou only have to look at the effect Covid-19 is having on black and ethnic minority groups \u2013 it\u2019s quite shocking really. It\u2019s most definitely a worry for football given the percentage of players from those backgrounds and it\u2019s vital that before we get playing again the strongest safety measures are in place to ensure everyone involved doesn\u2019t catch the virus.\u201d</p> <p>It can be argued that competitive sport \u2013 and football especially \u2013 will provide BAME athletes with a space that is safer than even their own homes. Testing will be stringent, medics will be on hand and, as such, they should not fear a return to action. There is sense in that way of thinking but, equally, it does not fully take into account those circumstances that are BAME-specific, or at least BAME-prevalent.</p> <p>McAnuff, for instance, has been dropping off food at the home of his elderly Jamaican father while he self-isolates, which touches on the socio-economic aspect of the issue given his father lives in Tottenham \u2013 where the family grew up and he has remained through a desire for familiarity but which, like many parts of London with long-standing ethnic communities, is densely populated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5bb48ec0f2ce3fceb4a247c3ab731f2a4ac80b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5bb48ec0f2ce3fceb4a247c3ab731f2a4ac80b0/0_139_4256_2555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Street art in south London by the artist Deanio_X.

It\u2019s a difficult situation.\u201d</p> <p>The British sprinter Asha Philip does not have to worry about dropping off food to family given most of them are living with her during lockdown. As the 29-year-old put it: \u201cMy mum, my brother, his girlfriend, their two kids and my sister and her child just turned up at my house and haven\u2019t left.\u201d</p> <p>This has created an environment that is common within BAME communities \u2013 a sizeable number of people from various generations cohabiting under one roof, and which could therefore be deemed a concern in regards to the spread of infection. But Philip, who has won gold, silver and bronze medals across Olympic, world and European championships and Commonwealth Games, insists her home is safe.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re all staying indoors and being very strict in regard to cleanliness \u2013 for instance, all our post is sprayed with Dettol as soon as it comes through the front door,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mum does have diabetes but it\u2019s a mild form and none of the rest of us have underlying health issues, so we\u2019re OK on that front.\u201d</p> <p>Philip, who is of Antiguan and Jamaican descent, has no concerns as a BAME athlete about returning to competitive action. But because of her background she is worried about competing at the world indoor championships in Nanjing next March, having read about the treatment of black people in China following the spread of coronavirus. </p> <p>Last month it was reported that a branch of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-52274326\" title=\"\">McDonald\u2019s in Guangzhou</a> had banned black people from entering because of fears they were spreading Covid-19 \u2013 leading to an apology from the restaurant chain and a temporary closing of the premises \u2013 and that in the same city, hundreds of Africans had been evicted from hotels and apartments due to the same, unfounded fears.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/08/neutral-venue-plan-has-no-rationale-says-former-football-police-commander-premier-league-fans\">Neutral venue plan has 'no rationale', says former football police commander</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHearing things like that is scary as a black person, especially given I\u2019m meant to be going to China next year,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a worry. Hopefully things will have changed massively by the time the worlds take place.\u201d</p> <p>There are a host of unknowns across the sporting landscape, especially in regards to which, if any, measures should be put in place to safeguard BAME athletes. The Guardian has contacted a number of governing and representative bodies regarding the matter, including the Football Association, UK Athletics, the Professional Cricketers\u2019 Association and the Rugby League Players Association, and the message has essentially been the same \u2013 we are waiting on government and medical guidance. </p> <p>But how long will that wait be \u2013 and will BAME athletes feel truly safe? </p>",
  "<p>The end is not in sight. With an <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8297425/Coronavirus-infecting-20-000-people-day-Britain-warns-leading-expert.html\">estimated 20,000 new infections a day</a>, and with experts warning that the reproduction rate of coronavirus may be rising again, any premature loosening of the lockdown will only prolong the crisis. When the prime minister speaks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/07/no-10-scrambles-to-control-amid-fierce-criticism-of-lockdown-mixed-messages\" title=\"\">on Sunday evening</a>, it is essential that he makes it clear that people should still be staying at home, not relaxing their guard.</p> <p>Though so many other countries had been hit, the government did not act soon enough to either contain the threat or prepare for it. Those failures have made a longer and tougher lockdown necessary. It was slow to take the pandemic seriously, slow to impose stringent social distancing, and slow to pursue equipment, testing and tracing, as the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, noted this week.</p> <p>At the same time, it has been far too hasty in its promises, and Boris Johnson is under pressure from his party\u2019s right for a hasty relaxation. Following his own experience with the virus, Mr Johnson is reportedly very cautious. Only weeks ago, the chief medical officer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/uk-will-need-social-distancing-until-at-least-end-of-year-says-whitty\" title=\"\">warned</a> that highly disruptive social distancing measures would be needed until at least the end of the year.</p> <p>Yet heading towards a warm bank holiday weekend, the promise that the prime minister would lay out a plan for England\u2019s gradual exit from lockdown, and his remark that he wanted to \u201cget going with some of these measures\u201d on Monday, led to excitable headlines promising that freedom beckoned.</p> <p>A swift revision of the message saw ministers speaking instead of modest changes for the next three weeks \u2013 of the kind already outlined for Wales \u2013 and only a tentative roadmap for after that, but damage may already have been done. A prime minister whose rhetoric so often invokes the second world war should remember that careless talk costs lives. There are signs that more people are out and about. On social media, the government switched from the clear injunction \u201cstay home\u201d to the nebulous \u201cstay safe\u201d. The \u201cfour nations\u201d approach was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/strain-emerges-between-uk-government-and-scotland-over-easing-lockdown\" title=\"\">strained</a> as Nicola Sturgeon said she wouldn\u2019t be pressured into loosening measures.</p> <p>Though lockdown is undoubtedly more comfortable for some than others, no one relishes uncertainty about the future or being cut off from friends and family. For many people, the impact is profound. Households are going hungry. Disadvantaged children will fall further behind academically. Domestic abuse is increasing. The Bank of England has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/07/uk-economy-to-shrink-by-25-percent-and-unemployment-to-double-warns-bank-of-england-coronavirus\" title=\"\">predicted</a> that the economy could shrink by 14% this year, in its sharpest contraction for three centuries.</p> <p>Public <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/1258790013975830528\" title=\"\">caution</a> is not a sign that Britain has become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/anxiety-plans-cut-furlough-scheme-workers-chancellor-coronavirus-payout\" title=\"\">\u201caddicted\u201d</a> to the furlough scheme, but simply that people are rightly aware of the risks to themselves and those they love. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14829\" title=\"\">warned</a> this week, a world with no lockdown and a rapidly spreading pandemic does not make for a healthy economy; and nor does one in which containment measures are reintroduced repeatedly because they were eased too quickly and in ill-judged ways.</p> <p>A successful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/04/eight-lessons-controlling-coronavirus-east-asian-nations-pandemic-public-health\" title=\"\">exit</a> will require a much sharper drop in infections, and better preparation, than we have so far seen. Immense issues remain with testing. Tracing is not feasible while the incidence of infections is so high, and the government could yet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/07/uk-may-ditch-nhs-contact-tracing-app-for-apple-and-google-model\" title=\"\">ditch its own contact-tracing app</a> in favour of the \u201cdecentralised\u201d model favoured by Apple and Google. Health and social care workers must be adequately protected. Though the right would like to see Mr Johnson offer a timeline for key measures, this should be resisted. A broad outline of plans is sensible. But any dates attached, however carefully caveated, will inevitably be seen as promises; the political pressure not to deviate from them will be intense.</p> <p>What is needed is sober decision-making, with an open discussion about the scientific evidence, and proper scrutiny. Choosing to lay out his plan in a televised briefing, rather than to parliament, is another sign of Mr Johnson\u2019s disdain for the institution and reluctance to be held accountable. This cannot continue. The government made a disastrous start to this crisis. Close attention is required to ensure its exit plan is not similarly flawed.</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s bank holiday weekend, and the sun is shining across much of the country. Any other year beaches would be packed, kickstarting the annual holiday season. But this year many of the UK\u2019s hoteliers, tourist attractions and holiday park operators are wondering if and when they will be able to open at all over the coming summer months, a time when they should be banking the profits to tide them through the slower winter months.</p> <p>Tourism is part of the UK\u2019s \u00a3130bn hospitality sector, which employs 3.2 million people, so the stakes are high. Between June and September, for instance, Cornwall usually takes in 55% of its near-\u00a32bn annual tourist spend.</p> <p>Malcolm Bell, chief executive of Visit Cornwall, says the tourist business will be tuning in to Boris Johnson\u2019s broadcast on Sunday evening, when he is expected to outline the first tentative measures towards easing the lockdown. In Cornwall, Bell says, up to 40,000 jobs are on the line.</p> <p>Key to the future of the holiday industry is trying to understand what long-term social distancing means for tourism \u2013 from monitoring intensive care bed availability to turning families with buckets and spades away from the beaches and managing shared toilet blocks.</p> <p>After being stuck at home for seven weeks plenty of Britons are desperate to leave their homes, but whether they will be able to go on holiday, can afford to \u2013 or will feel brave enough \u2013 is another question.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09dd2ba228463ed712e9c7d503a9c576092e8a2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09dd2ba228463ed712e9c7d503a9c576092e8a2b/0_430_4985_2991/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elderly holiday makers in St Ives, Cornwall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elderly holiday makers in St Ives, Cornwall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The air travel search website Skyscanner said that bookings and activity on the site is lower than normal at this time of year, with customers planning long-haul winter breaks rather than a traditional summer holidays.</p> <p>But a consumer poll conducted last week by the company found just 18% of Britons believed domestic travel would be safe within a month and only 39% thought it would be safe within three months. For overseas travel those figures were lower \u2013 8% and 24% respectively.</p> <p>The British Holiday &amp; Home Parks Association (BH&amp;HPA) which has 2,000 members ranging from small camp grounds to caravan sites and large holiday parks, said that despite the closure of all parks, its phones were still ringing. \u201c[Members] are getting a lot of interest for bookings, said BH&amp;HPA spokesman Jon Boston. \u201cThere is a big latent demand to get out and about.\u201d</p> <p>The owners of rental firm Brecon Beacons Holiday Cottages \u2013 with 400 properties on its books \u2013 are less sure. \u201cWe have not had a massive amount of bookings for this summer yet but I\u2019m hoping it will happen,\u201d says Liz Daniel, one of the directors.</p> <p>Daniel is eager to hear the prime minister\u2019s plan to scale back the lockdown: \u201cWe are waiting to get a definitive idea of the type of cleaning that will be expected and the timescale if a property might need to be left empty before the next guests. This will make things very, very difficult for existing bookings.\u201d</p> <p>However, once the plan for the summer months is clearer Daniel is optimistic people will want to \u201crun to the hills\u201d. \u201cWe have some truly gorgeous remote cottages and I think there could not be a safer place,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The Isle of Wight usually attracts 2.4 million visitors a year and Will Myles, managing director of Visit Isle of Wight, also believes potential holidaymakers are still keen. \u201cWe\u2019re still getting emails asking for brochures,\u201d he says of the island which has been chosen as the guinea pig for the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/04/contact-tracing-app-to-be-piloted-on-isle-of-wight-this-week-matt-hancock-says\">coronavirus contact-tracing app.</a> \u201cThe demand is there.

Cornwall has 530,000 residents but its population increases by 185,000 during the peak holiday season.</p> <p>Bell, who lives near Truro, says he has debates with his family over the pros and cons of reopening. But, he says, that unless the government is \u201cgoing to come over the hill with a \u00a31.5bn cheque for Cornwall\u201d a balance will need to be struck.</p> <p>\u201cI say \u2018what about the 40% of businesses we know are in distress and those worried about losing their job and their houses? What about the fishermen who aren\u2019t selling any fish?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Visit Cornwall is working with the council, police and NHS to figure what the safe number of visitors could be. They may also need to manage crowds on Cornwall\u2019s 300 beaches, which include family-friendly spots such as the two mile-long Perranporth with its natural swimming pool.</p> <p>\u201cOne way is to control car parking,\u201d says Bell. \u201cIf you know what the beach can take you can have that number of car parking spaces, and then a ban on parking within a certain distance.\u201d Attractions could also introduce timed entry of the kind already operated at popular sights such as Tintagel Castle.</p> <p>When holiday parks and campsites reopen around the country, those who own properties and caravans may be allowed back before renters and campers. Tent pitches will be spaced out more than normal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Martin Smith, founder of Campsites.co.uk, said the number of visitors to its site had picked up in the last fortnight but \u201cbooking and enquiry volumes are still 95% down on last year, and most people are looking at August rather than anything sooner\u201d.</p> <p>Many campsites are small family businesses, Smith says, and they may have reservations about their own health: \u201cThey will be weighing that up against being unable to survive a summer of no bookings.\u201d</p> <p>If there is no summer trade many businesses will be mothballed until next spring \u2013 a decision that would have a big impact on jobs in a place like Cornwall where one in three households is at least partially reliant on tourism. \u201cThat would mean between 30,000 and 40,000 redundancies, which is a scary,\u201d says Bell.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to open a day too early, but equally not a day too late.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Lisa Nandy has said the government\u2019s \u201cgo it alone\u201d approach left Britain unable to to prepare for the coronavirus crisis as she urged Boris Johnson to spearhead international cooperation to create and distribute a vaccine.</p> <p>In her first newspaper interview since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/starmer-names-nandy-as-shadow-foreign-secretary-as-he-starts-building-cabinet\">becoming shadow foreign secretary</a>, the former Labour leadership candidate said the aftermath of the pandemic should mark a \u201cserious reckoning\u201d about Britain\u2019s role in the world. She criticised the \u201cmyth of exceptionalism\u201d, which she said was part of the country\u2019s self-image.</p> <p>\u201cBritain was in that position, where our government had increasingly taken an isolationist route, and championed the idea of a small island nation that would go it alone, and punch above its weight, without stopping to think about how we were going to exert power and influence in the world, particularly with China and the US taking the approach that they\u2019ve taken,\u201d Nandy said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned in this pandemic is that that global Britain approach that was supposed to put Britain first, has actually ended up putting us last \u2013 and that in the future we\u2019re going to have a serious reckoning about how Britain does form alliances across the world, that enable us to not just survive future pandemics and global shocks, but actually to thrive during some very very difficult times.\u201d</p> <p>She welcomed that fact that Britain co-hosted a pledging conference with the EU last week, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/boris-johnson-cooperation-coronavirus-vaccine-bid\">raise funding for vaccine development</a>, and described the race to discover one as \u201cthe most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes\u201d.</p> <p>But she pointed out that the US was not involved in the conference \u2013 and a rival event was held on the same day, in which the Indian government, among others, was involved.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47afe27fde2909e059fc315ef44363532fdcf40d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47afe27fde2909e059fc315ef44363532fdcf40d/0_146_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer during Prime Minister\u2019s Questions in the House of Commons on 6 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer during Prime Minister\u2019s Questions in the House of Commons on 6 May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cUnless we get a global response, we\u2019ll see countries scrabbling for a vaccine in competition with one another.

We\u2019ll be reliant on other countries, many of which weren\u2019t present in those discussions on Monday. So we need a global agreement, not just about developing a vaccine, but then about manufacturing, and then about equitable access.\u201d</p> <p>She urged Britain to do more to facilitate a global response.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a series of crunch moments coming up \u2013 key summits around the world \u2013 where it will be determined whether we can forge a global response, whether we can persuade drug companies to pull patents, for example, whether we can get an agreement about what an equitable distribution of the vaccine would look like.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a government that has made much of our special relationship with the United States, we need to be reaching across the Atlantic and ensuring that America comes to the table, and that we get a genuine global response to the crisis.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cUnless we deal with this now, we\u2019re going to find, just like with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/no-complaint-or-refund-demand-over-400000-unusable-nhs-gowns\">PPE</a>, with testing, with the furlough scheme, with all of the issues that we\u2019ve had to confront as a country, that we\u2019re not prepared, and that we\u2019re <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/07/no-10-scrambles-to-control-amid-fierce-criticism-of-lockdown-mixed-messages\">behind the curve</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Starmer\u2019s frontbench have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/01/labour-keir-starmer-coronavirus-covid-19-new-era\">cautious in their criticism</a> of the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic, believing the national mood favoured a constructive approach.</p> <p>But shadow ministers have stepped up their attacks in recent days, with Starmer using an article in the Daily Telegraph on Friday to accuse Johnson of failing to protect veterans in care homes.</p> <p>Nandy said Britain was one of those countries where a \u201cmyth of exceptionalism\u201d had taken hold, leading to \u201can enormous divergence\u201d in the way the outbreak has been tackled, creating problems for citizens and businesses.</p> <p>\u201cEven this week, with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-contact-tracing-app-is-it-safe-and-will-people-use-it\">newly launched app</a> on the Isle of Wight, there\u2019s been a discussion in government about whether they now need to change the technology they\u2019re using around that app, to bring them in line with other countries,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t start to get this right, and to see the world pulling together, we will continue to see those problems and those barriers.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab509e625d79f40961451c1ebe4d05c57c014019\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab509e625d79f40961451c1ebe4d05c57c014019/0_191_4503_2703/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lisa Nandy addresses the Labour party conference in Brighton, 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lisa Nandy addresses the Labour party conference in Brighton, 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Thomas/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 40-year-old\u2019s appointment was one of the surprises in the radical reshuffle carried out by Keir Starmer after he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/the-guardian-view-on-keir-starmer-a-serious-politician\">won the Labour leadership</a> last month.</p> <p>She had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/13/refreshingly-untribal-lisa-nandy-labour-best-hope\">impressed many party members </a>with assured media performances during her own campaign for the leadership, but was better known for championing the needs of towns like her Wigan constituency than for her views on foreign policy.</p> <p>Nandy said her \u201cmission\u201d in the post would be to \u201cconnect back together what is happening to people in places like Wigan, and what is happening at that multilateral level - and why those two things might work in tandem and why they matter so much\u201d.</p> <p>She highlighted what she sees as a \u201ccrisis of legitimacy\u201d for globalisation, which fed the rise of populist leaders, including Donald Trump, and the Brexit vote in 2016.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the things that is foremost in my mind is that the globalisation model that we had has become completely unsustainable in large parts of the world.

  "<p>In 1964, Janet Carr, a clinical psychologist, was asked to work on a follow-up study of 54 six-week-old babies with Down\u2019s syndrome at the Maudsley hospital in London. Initially Carr, who has died aged 92, was going to track the children only until they were four, but it became one of the longest follow-up studies in the world. </p> <p>In 2014, a party was held at the House of Lords to celebrate the study running for 50 years. Chris Oliver, the director of the Cerebra centre for neurodevelopmental disorders at Birmingham University, commented: \u201cThe longest follow-up studies we have are usually five to seven years. So that 50-year follow-up is absolutely remarkable.\u201d</p> <p>Many people living with Down\u2019s syndrome also develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Oliver said: \u201cJanet was incredibly prescient in keeping the study going \u2013 there may be markers, behavioural or otherwise, in Down\u2019s syndrome people in their early lives that may predict their later outcome. Janet\u2019s detailed data sets allow us to check back to when someone was a toddler or a young infant to see if there were characteristics that might predict the outcome 50 years later. As well as for Down\u2019s, the study has implications for other people who get Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>The initial aim of Carr\u2019s study was to establish the abilities and development of babies with Down\u2019s syndrome. Earlier in the 20th century, these had not been considered, because their life expectancy was so short \u2013 in 1929, for example, it was only nine years. But this was changing with advances in medicine, such as the ability to correct the holes in the heart that many people with Down\u2019s are born with. (Life expectancy today for people with Down\u2019s is around 60.)</p> <p>As she began the study, Carr was curious about the effect on families and whether the received wisdom that having a baby with Down\u2019s was catastrophic for their families was true. She said: \u201cI knew from my own experience that even bringing up babies with no disabilities is not always plain sailing.\u201d So she decided to widen the study\u2019s scope and do a PhD comparing families with a baby with Down\u2019s with those who had developmentally normal children.</p> <p>From 1964 until 1968 Carr drove around Surrey and south London visiting families in her study at six months, 10 months, 15 months, and then at yearly intervals. Most of those with Down\u2019s syndrome were cared for at home, but nine were in children\u2019s homes. She sent them birthday and Christmas cards and tried to make her visits something to look forward to. As a result, only three families withdrew from the trial, a low \u201cattrition rate\u201d that was a triumph, according to her colleagues.</p> <p>When she started interviewing families, Carr found that how parents were told about their child\u2019s condition made a huge difference. She said: \u201cThey spoke resentfully when the teller seemed unfeeling. In some cases the prognosis was unduly discouraging. Some parents were given the impression their child would never walk, talk or become toilet-trained.\u201d She discovered there was little difference in impact on the family between those caring for a child with Down\u2019s and a baby without it. For example, in both sets of families, about half the mothers said their marriage was very good.</p> <p>After the four years of the initial study, Carr remained in contact, got further funding and then revisited the participants at 11 years old, 21, 30, 35, 40, 45, 47 and finally, in 2014, at 50. Her study charted how they coped with schooling \u2013 from 1970 they had a right to education and from 1981 could attend mainstream schools \u2013 and the workplace. She noted changing attitudes too: when she started, many people with Down\u2019s lived in long-stay hospitals, but by 2014 they were either with their families or in supported living accommodation. Carr noted how \u2013 as with the rest of the population \u2013 those in her cohort had diverse trajectories and although some had profound care needs, others were able to live and work independently. Her findings dispelled the idea that families were unable to cope or that siblings became resentful.</p> <p>Janet was born in Peking (Beijing), where her father, Trevor Gilfillan, a headmaster, and mother, Gertrude (nee Rennoldson), were living. When her father got TB, the family returned to their native England and Janet went to Moira House school in Eastbourne. She was evacuated to Devon and the Lake District during the second world war and was devastated when her brother Jim died shortly afterwards in an air accident in Nigeria.</p> <p>She studied psychology at Reading University and then did a master\u2019s in clinical psychology at the Maudsley. She worked at the Crayford child guidance clinic in Kent in 1950-55, and met Eric Carr, a psychiatrist. The pair married in 1954, and had three children, Jim, Nicholas and Sally.</p> <p>After working in Brighton as a psychologist at the Royal Alexandra hospital in 1961-63, Carr became a research assistant at the psychiatric genetics research unit of the Maudsley, where she became involved in the Down\u2019s study and wrote up the initial research for her doctoral thesis in 1970-71. In 1971 she became a consultant psychologist at Hilda Lewis House at the Bethlem Royal hospital, caring for children with learning disabilities. The unit tried to keep families together and Carr\u2019s unflagging optimism and practical common sense helped numerous families. From this experience, she wrote Helping Your Handicapped Child (1980), illustrated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/posy-simmonds\">Posy Simmonds</a>, to give parents much-needed coping strategies.</p> <p>Carr became an authority on Down\u2019s, working as a lecturer and tutor at the University of London (1970-82) and at St George\u2019s hospital, London (1982-92). She wrote prolifically, including books for the public such as Down\u2019s Syndrome: Children Growing Up (1995), as well as academic titles and papers. For many years she was the behaviour adviser to the <a href=\"https://www.downs-syndrome.org.uk/\">Down\u2019s Syndrome Association</a>, offering a lifeline of specialist knowledge to parents.</p> <p>Carr had a huge talent for friendship and loved music and cookery. Naming her Surrey home Pemberley was testament to her love of Jane Austen. She played tennis into her 80s and took her family to Val Thorens to celebrate her 85th birthday, impressing her grandchildren by skiing every day.</p> <p>In 2015 she suffered a serious car accident, but recovered sufficiently to receive her OBE from the Queen. In 2016 she moved to Wales, then Shropshire, to live near her daughter .</p> <p>Carr\u2019s marriage ended in divorce in 1980. She is survived by her children and five grandchildren.</p> <p>\u2022 Janet Gould Carr, clinical psychologist, born 31 March 1927; died 17 March 2020</p>",
  "<p>Greater Manchester police have said they are investigating an incident in which a man was Tasered by officers in front of his young child, after a video circulated on social media.</p> \n<p>A video of the incident, which happened at a petrol station in Stretford at approximately 11pm on Wednesday, shows Desmond Ziggy Mombeyarara, 34, being confronted by two GMP officers while carrying the boy.</p> \n<p>Shortly after he puts the child, who can be heard screaming \u201cDaddy\u201d throughout the footage, on the ground, the man is Tasered by one of the policemen.</p> \n<p>He is then repeatedly shouted at to put his hands behind his back by the officer, while still incapacitated on the floor, and in the view of the young child.</p> \n<p>The force have since confirmed that Mombeyarara was stopped by police after allegedly driving over the speed limit.</p> \n<p>He has since been charged with two counts of resisting a constable in the course of their duty, as well as single counts of driving at excess speed, not having vehicle insurance, being unfit to drive through drink and failing without reasonable excuse to cooperate with a preliminary test.</p> \n<p>He was also charged with failing to stop when required to do so by police, and unnecessary travel.</p> \n<p>GMP said they had referred the deployment of the Taser to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, as well as to their own professional standards branch.</p> \n<p>Supt Mark Kenny said: \u201cWe are aware of public concern regarding this arrest and I want to reassure the public that this matter is being reviewed and treated seriously. In addition we have voluntarily referred this matter to the IOPC.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dionne Allman, 19, who lives across the road from the Salford service station on Chester Road and filmed the incident, said she had heard shouting outside at about 11pm on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>\u201cA lot of disturbances happen at that petrol station and it\u2019s something that I usually ignore, but I heard the kid screaming and that\u2019s when I started to pay attention,\u201d she said, adding that the boy looked to be about two or three years old.</p> \n<p>She said she had heard \u201ca lot of back and forth between him and the police\u201d but could not work out what was being said, although she described the officers as being \u201caggressive and threatening\u201d.</p> \n<p>She said: \u201cFor most of it it just seemed like they were trying to detain him but there was no sort of progression with it, there was no trying to deescalate the situation.\u201d</p> \n<p>She added: \u201cI was in complete shock. You don\u2019t really believe that something like that could happen, especially in the UK. My immediate thought was, \u2018Oh my God, that child just had to watch that,\u2019\u201d she added.</p> \n<p>When the footage went viral, the public called for the incident to be addressed and Greater Manchester\u2019s mayor, Andy Burnham, said he had asked for an \u201curgent and independent\u201d review into the events.</p> \n<p>\u201cFrom what I have been told, it would appear that the officers were right to apprehend the individual who was putting his child and others at risk by his actions,\u201d he said in a statement.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut it is not at all clear that the level of force used in this instance, particularly in front of a child, was proportionate or justified and that is why I have asked for an urgent and independent review to be carried out.\u201d</p> \n<p>Clare Collier, Liberty\u2019s advocacy director, said: \u201cThis video is incredibly distressing and raises many questions. Tasers put people\u2019s lives at risk, which is why the mass rollout of these weapons on our streets is dangerous and must be stopped. The growing use of Tasers will exacerbate the overpolicing of minority and marginalised communities, particularly people of colour, as well as those experiencing mental health issues.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The pre-eminent film in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jun/26/roger-moore-james-bond-007-role-model\">Sir Roger Moore\u2019s non-Bond oeuvre</a> was released in 1974, between Live and Let Die and The Man With the Golden Gun.</p> <p>I was born in 1978, so I was far too young to see Gold in its first flush of youth, let alone mine. So was my friend Tom.</p> <p>But Gold was Tom\u2019s favourite film when he was 12 years old, and he\u2019s convinced me it should\u2019ve been mine. What follows is his explanation of why:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Like many others born in the late 70s, Roger was the Bond for me. I was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/24/roger-moore-best-james-bond-007-wedding-day?CMP=fb_gu&amp;fbclid=IwAR3XMwN5bJmsT5vDyw3WIWUkU6nlwBXuqrZvIFCr3REEvK0_CBJ4QMTTZCs\">taken to see Octopussy in the summer of 1983</a> and that was it: an unconsummated love affair that continues to this day, despite Roger\u2019s passing almost three years ago.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t just the excitement and the impossible-to-describe plot. It was something about Roger himself. The underdog absurdity of this 56-year-old playing Britain\u2019s top secret agent. The sheer amount of hair he had managed to retain. The measured pace of his movements, which John Barry conducted the incidental music to fit ... it all spun its web for me.</p> <p>And so, naturally, I watched the rest of the canon. But by the late 80s, I\u2019d seen all seven of his Bonds, again and again and again. I could quote the scripts, sing the songs, name the cinematographers. I read books about Moore \u2013 authorised and not \u2013 and mastered most of the dates of his various marriages. The usual stuff 10-year-olds get up to.</p> <p>Biographies listed his other films. I hungered for them. But it was the 80s, and if you wanted to watch a film no one else did you had to wait and wait for it to appear on BBC2 at 2.35am on a Tuesday in March, then pray the video timer would work.</p> <p>Was there any agony deeper than finding you had recorded either a blank screen for two hours or part two of the Joan Collins miniseries Sins? You only got one chance. You had to be ready. No mistakes.</p> <p>Slowly but surely I found them: The Wild Geese, The Sea Wolves, North Sea Hijack, Escape to Athena, Shout at the Devil. But never Gold. Why? What the fuck was Michael Grade, or whoever was doing the scheduling, up to?</p> <p>Then, finally, it arrived. Gold (1974). Thursday. BBC2. 11.45pm. \u201cSouth African mining thriller.\u201d</p> <p>The timer was set. Somehow, it worked.</p> <p>Somehow, the film ticked all the boxes.</p> <p>Roger as a maverick mining engineer. An absurd plot to flood a South African gold mine in order to raise the price of gold and make a huge amount of money for a syndicate of villains. Roger sharing champagne and a bath with Susannah York. Intrusive incidental music, a couple of truly absurd songs and a climax at Pinewood studios. It was practically a Bond film, Roger-style. Except not many people knew it. It was <em>my</em> Roger adventure. It was private. I felt I had an edge over his other fans. I didn\u2019t, of course.</p> </blockquote> <p>Who does? This is the movies. We cherish our illusions. And now it\u2019s 2020, and in the grip of a pandemic, locked down, we turn to our certainties, our treasures, our gold. By email, from stricken Manhattan to prostrate Hither Green, I asked Tom the question at hand: does Gold still shine?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/24/roger-moore-best-james-bond-007-wedding-day\">Never meet your heroes \u2013 unless they\u2019re Roger Moore, the greatest Bond of all | Mark O\u2019Connell</a> </p> </aside>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRQakZ35P3I\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qRQakZ35P3I?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Gold: the trailer.</figcaption> </figure>   <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The quick answer is: \u201cNo.\u201d The longer answer is that it depends on your expectations. If you feel certain you are about to watch an execrable film, you will be pleasantly surprised: Gold is a perfectly serviceable thriller, with some tense moments and a genuinely exciting climax in the flooded mine at Pinewood.</p> <p>One of the reasons the film isn\u2019t as shit as it should be is that it was made, in no small part, by members of the James Bond team. Peter Hunt directs \u2013 he was editor of the early Bonds and directed On Her Majesty\u2019s Secret Service. John Glen, later to direct five Bonds, edits and directs the second unit. The production designer is Syd Cain, who did From Russia With Love, OHMSS and Live and Let Die. Those guys are responsible for making two men and a dinghy floating around at Pinewood seem an exciting climax.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s Roger\u2019s character, Rod Slater, a maverick, woman-chasing commitment-phobe ultimately prepared to die to save the mine (and its miners), which he almost does. There\u2019s a suggestion a genuine relationship may be on the cards with Terry Steyner (York), whose evil husband has conveniently died a few minutes earlier and who is on hand to look after Rod in an ambulance.</p> <p>It\u2019s definitely one of Roger\u2019s best non-007 performances. This was 1974, so he hadn\u2019t established his Bond persona. Hunt pushes him to be as serious as possible. I certainly believe he\u2019s a miner. And that he\u2019s younger than his 46 years \u2013 he\u2019s in good shape, the hair\u2019s more tousled than usual and there\u2019s a bit more sweat than Bond. And he gets quite badly injured at the end. Or at least his arms do.</p> <p>My sense is that York fought hard to be more than just another Bond girl, making her character as strong as possible. There\u2019s a great scene where she flies Moore back to the stricken mine in her plane (she\u2019s rich) and he accuses her of being involved in the conspiracy.

  "<p>It has been billed as key to getting Britain back on its feet to help navigate a future way of life post-lockdown. But before the new Covid-19 contact-tracing app is rolled out across the UK this month, it must pass a pilot on the Isle of Wight where it appears to have got off to a bumpy start \u2013 with emerging signs of a generational divide.</p> \n<p>Although most locals told the Guardian they were broadly supportive of the idea, questions have been raised about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/critical-mass-of-android-users-needed-for-success-of-nhs-coronavirus-contact-tracing-app\">glitches</a> on some phones and the potential lack of takeup among the island\u2019s older, less tech-savvy residents.</p> \n<p>And just as the NHS app was unveiled to the island on Thursday morning, it was dealt a further blow when a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/uk-coronavirus-contract-tracing-app-could-fall-foul-of-privacy-law-government-told\">parliamentary committee warned</a> it must not be released in its current form without increased privacy and data protections. Meanwhile, it emerged that Downing Street was leaving open <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/07/uk-may-ditch-nhs-contact-tracing-app-for-apple-and-google-model\">the prospect of ditching the app entirely</a> and instead opting for a \u201cdecentralised\u201d model favoured by Apple and Google.</p> \n<p>By late morning on Thursday, 33,000 of the Isle of Wight\u2019s 140,000 residents were undeterred and had downloaded it, with 28 logging symptoms, the local Tory MP Bob Seely said. (Key workers had access to the app earlier in the week.) Later in the day, downloads topped 40,000.</p> \n<p>Seely rejected privacy objections, saying: \u201cIf we\u2019re not first on the island, we\u2019re last\u2026 It\u2019s good for my folks because we get stuff early, we get to test the stuff and the social scientists can then take that information so there\u2019s a win-win for both sides.\u201d</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/08/how-covid-19-contact-tracing-can-help-beat-the-pandemic\">NHS app works by using bluetooth technology</a> to register when people come into close contact with each other. Relying on users to flag when they develop symptoms, the app then uses a centralised database to alert others with whom they have come into contact that they are at risk of infection so they can isolate and get tested. It does not require users to register their names, only asking for part of their postcode, with NHSX \u2013 a digital unit under both the Department of Health and the NHS \u2013 claiming that the \u201capp does not collect personally identifiable data\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/contact_trace_app-zip/giv-3902m6WvhumRbMZn/\" data-alt=\"contact tracing app\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/contact_trace_app-zip/giv-3902m6WvhumRbMZn/\">contact tracing app</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Richard Quigley, who stood against Seely as the Labour candidate at the general election and runs a fish and chip shop in Cowes, said he was cautiously supportive but warned against people treating the app as an \u201celectronic vaccine\u201d, meaning they could flout physical distancing.</p> \n<p>The government is aiming for 60% of the population to download the app for it to work effectively. But with more than a quarter of the island aged 65 and over, there are fears the app may hit a stumbling block with older people who are not as tech-minded or who do not own smartphones.</p> \n<p>Kevin Lewis, 74, from Northwood, a village near Cowes, said he did not even know what Bluetooth was. He explained neither he nor his 70-year-old wife would be using the app as, despite both having smartphones, they felt they lacked the digital wherewithal.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/07/uk-may-ditch-nhs-contact-tracing-app-for-apple-and-google-model\">UK may ditch NHS contact-tracing app for Apple and Google model</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s going to abjectly fail,\u201d said the semi-retired coach driver who has lived on the island his whole life. \u201cI\u2019m very limited in my usage of my smartphone because I\u2019m just not of that generation.

Natasha Edwards, 41, managing director of the Garlic Farm, a family-run business in Newchurch, was quick to download the app and was encouraging others to follow despite being aware of reservations. \u201cI know there\u2019s a bit of negativity on the Isle of Wight among various community groups, there\u2019s the usual paranoia about security and privacy, which I think is probably quite valid,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cMost people I\u2019ve spoken to, my friends and contacts, are really keen to get it downloaded. They\u2019re willing to make that small sacrifice of privacy, or perceived privacy. If it\u2019s going to help us come out of lockdown sooner, which I don\u2019t know whether it would, let\u2019s go for it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Steve Young, 44, an NHS data analyst, and his wife, a nurse, who both work at St Mary\u2019s hospital \u2013 which has recorded 28 Covid-19 deaths \u2013 were both supportive of the app.</p> \n<p>\u201cI suppose, like everybody, I was a little bit concerned to start with from the privacy point of view. But, if I\u2019m quite honest, what have we got to lose? Anybody who has a smartphone of any description has pretty much signed away a significant amount of privacy anyway,\u201d Young said.</p> \n<p>However, he shared concerns about the likelihood of the app\u2019s takeup among older people. \u201cI\u2019ve got a 60-year-old lady who lives opposite me, she\u2019s a frontline worker, she\u2019s a carer. If anybody needs it, it\u2019s her.

  "<p>What skin color are the bad guys in America\u2019s fantasies of vigilantism?

That theater filled with men the same age range as Greg and Travis McMichael erupted as if at that moment, all that they had ever imagined had been fulfilled on the big screen. Needless to say, I left that theater before the credits rolled.</p> <p>Across the country, our political leaders hold these same bigoted beliefs which inevitably lead to policies that directly assume criminality based on skin color.</p> <p>During his tenure as mayor of New York City, billionaire Michael Bloomberg made it explicitly clear why it was that he sent police officers into black and brown communities to \u201cthrow them\u201d up against the wall. In his 2015 Aspen Institute speech he<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/11/804795405/throw-them-against-the-wall-and-frisk-them-bloomberg-s-2015-race-talk-stirs-deba\"> stated</a>:</p> <p>\u201cPeople say, \u2018Oh my God, you are arresting kids for marijuana who are all minorities.\u2019 Yes, that\u2019s true. Why? Because we put all the cops in the minority neighborhoods. Yes, that\u2019s true. Why\u2019d we do it? Because that\u2019s where all the crime is. And the way you should get the guns out of the kids\u2019 hands is throw them against the wall and frisk them.\u201d</p> <p>And it is for this reason that I do not distinguish between the violence committed by American citizens acting as vigilantes and the violence committed by so-called officers of the law when, in both cases, the working assumption and driving force behind that violence is the deeply bigoted and firmly American association between blackness and criminality.</p> <p>For Ahmaud, that association not only led to his brutal killing, but it also initially meant his killer not being arrested. It took more than two months for the father and son duo to be arrested. When explaining why they were not charged immediately the district attorney, George Barnhill, immediately stated that the victim, Ahmaud Arbery, was, in fact, the \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenjaminPDixon/status/1258515536431812608/photo/1\">criminal suspect</a>\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt appears that [Greg and Travis McMichael\u2019s] intent was to stop and hold this criminal suspect until law enforcement arrived. Under Georgia Law [sic] this is perfectly legal.\u201d</p> <p>Even after viewing the video and with no evidence beyond Ahmaud\u2019s skin color, the top cop in the institution designed to bring equal justice under the law concluded that Ahmaud was a criminal suspect when he was simply a black man taking a jog.</p> <p>What are black Americans to do when justice is delayed or outright denied because of the assignment of innocence to vigilantes and police officers?</p> <p>What are black Americans to do when the assumption of guilt because of our skin color is as American as the guns they use to kill us?</p> <p>What are we to do when in our neighbors\u2019 dreams and fantasies of cop-and-robber, the skin color of the bad guy matches our own?</p> <p>The very first thing we are going to do is defend ourselves as if our lives depend on it because when Americans fantasize about killing, those fantasies become our living nightmares.</p> <ul> <li><p>Benjamin Dixon is the host of the Benjamin Dixon show.</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>The recent first season of Star Trek: Picard boldly went in an unexpected direction, ending with the consciousness of the titular starship captain downloaded into a new synthetic body \u2013 meaning that the high-minded humanist of The Next Generation was technically no longer human. But for many fans, the transformation of another legacy character felt even more significant.</p> <p>Seven of Nine was formerly a <a href=\"https://www.looper.com/196441/the-untold-truth-of-seven-of-nine/\">catsuited \u201cbabe</a>\u201d who was added to the cast of Star Trek: Voyager in 1997 to lure back the 18-30 male demographic, who had apparently jumped ship thanks to the show\u2019s female captain. Played by Jeri Ryan, she was reimagined in Picard as a gun-toting, hard-drinking vigilante. Even more strikingly, in the closing moments of the season finale, she was glimpsed holding hands with another woman.</p> <p>Those who were paying attention five episodes earlier had already noticed the reference to a \u201cclose personal relationship\u201d between Seven and the villain of the week, Bjayzl. But the ambiguity of their brief exchange \u2013 cut short when Seven vaporised her \u2013 left fans in limbo. Had Star Trek really just queered Seven of Nine?</p> <p>Many were thrilled at what they saw as a bold new direction for the character. A former member of the Borg collective (a group of cyborgs known for physically mutilating and mentally controlling their unwitting victims), Seven had long proved a source of inspiration to survivors of abuse, and now she could do the same for queer fans as well. Others remained unconvinced, pointing out that, 20 years earlier, Seven once <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85O6HISsUTk\">propositioned a male crewmember</a> and shared a romantic picnic with another. As far as they were concerned, she was straight until \u201ccanonically\u201d proven otherwise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bd43538e0cb02875fb8565df0107f739821cf41d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd43538e0cb02875fb8565df0107f739821cf41d/955_0_2107_2106/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lucy Lawless and Renee O\u2019connor in Xena: Warrior Princess\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coded: Lucy Lawless and Renee O\u2019connor\u2019s character enjoyed an ambiguous relationship in Xena: Warrior Princess.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was just the latest chapter in Star Trek\u2019s chequered history with queer representation. Although creator Gene Roddenberry <a href=\"http://bbc.adactio.com/cult/st/tng/motss.shtml\">promised to introduce a gay character</a> back in 1991, it took a quarter-century for his pledge to be fulfilled. <em>S</em>tar Trek: Discovery now boasts three gay crewmembers (played by Anthony Rapp, Wilson Cruz and Tig Notaro) among the regular cast, so why is Seven of Nine\u2019s sexuality so important to fans? The answer, it seems, goes further than just representation. When she was first introduced in Voyager, Seven was a symbolic battleground for the politics of the time. While Trek\u2019s liberal-minded creatives wrote about a young woman gradually recovering from decades of trauma and abuse, the show\u2019s producers squeezed Ryan into an outfit so figure-hugging that she would occasionally pass out on set. (In Picard, she returns in a gender-neutral sweater, jeans and leather jacket.)</p> <p>From the start, Seven\u2019s sexuality was a source of controversy. A <a href=\"http://www.qrd.org/qrd/media/television/1997/will.new.star.trek.character.be.lesbian-09.05.97\">rumoured lesbian plot</a> never came to pass. Voyager showrunner Jeri Taylor, who was committed to honouring Roddenberry\u2019s promise, shared her frustration with TV Guide, saying: \u201cIt gradually became clear that this is a fight I could not win.\u2019 In the end, the best Taylor could do was include a couple of brief gay moments in one of her licensed Trek novels. Meanwhile, fans took to the nascent internet forums, imagining a relationship between Seven and her on-screen mentor, Captain Janeway.</p> <p>Star Trek\u2019s conservatism \u2013 somewhat at odds with the progressive model of the original 1960s Enterprise, which featured Russian, African and Japanese-American crewmembers \u2013 was to some extent a product of the time, when genre shows often included characters who were \u201cqueer-coded\u201d rather than unambiguously queer. Perhaps the most notorious example was Xena: Warrior Princess, in which the title character shared a bed, plenty of meaningful looks and even a number of on-screen kisses with her sidekick and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnQUwUqE1aw\">friend</a> Gabrielle.</p> <p>Arguably, such a coy approach came perilously close to \u201cqueerbaiting\u201d \u2013 teasing an LGBT audience with the prospect of an onscreen same-sex relationship, while refusing to actually depict one for fear of alienating heterosexual fans.</p> <p>These days, the bait doesn\u2019t always end in a switch, but savvy producers still use the prospect of a gay character as a way to attract audiences. It has been five years since <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2015/06/30/just-when-the-marvel-cinematic-universe-introduce-an-lgbtq-character-kevin-feige-says-itll-be-within-a-decade-5272298/\">Kevin Feige promised a gay hero</a> in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and so far none has materialised (unless their superpower is complete invisibility). In the same period, on the small screen, the other comic-book behemoth, DC, has provided a lesbian Batwoman, taking her cue from a 2006 reinvention of Batman\u2019s 1950s love interest in a limited comics series. It even presented, in the prequel series Gotham, a romance between the arch villains the Penguin and the Riddler.</p> <p>Reinventing legacy characters is, of course, a mainstay of comic-book storytelling, a way of keeping them fresh throughout the decades. But other long-running entertainment franchises can afford to follow the same example. Buffy the Vampire Slayer was perhaps ahead of its time when Willow shared her first same-sex kiss with another witch in the show\u2019s fifth season. The Simpsons, meanwhile, took 16 years to reveal that Marge\u2019s sister Patty was a lesbian.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a74526965d5a21a173f20753c7a151facfdae967\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a74526965d5a21a173f20753c7a151facfdae967/116_278_1528_1527/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hikaru Sulu (George Takei) in Star Trek\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fifty years in the closet: Hikaru Sulu (George Takei) had to wait until a 2016 film to be revealed as gay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/CBS via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However well-intentioned, the timing of such coming-out moments can be critical. When <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7053982.stm\">JK Rowling let slip</a> in 2007 that Harry Potter\u2019s headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, was gay, a mere three months after the final book in the series was published, many readers felt it was a shame she hadn\u2019t mentioned it earlier. And when the writers of the reboot movie Star Trek Beyond announced in 2016 that the franchise\u2019s first gay character would be a reimagined Hikaru Sulu, George Takei, the prominent LGBT activist who had originated the character 50 years earlier, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-36744328\">called the move \u201cunfortunate</a>\u201d, feeling it suggested he had been living in the closet for half a century.</p> <p>In fact, Sulu\u2019s \u201cgay moment\u201d in Beyond<em> </em>\u2013 putting his arm around another man as he is reunited with his daughter \u2013 was so brief that had it not been highlighted in the film\u2019s press campaign fans might easily have blinked and missed it. Similarly, the much-touted gay storyline in the most recent Star Wars movie, Rise of the Skywalker, turned out to be a momentary clinch between two background characters. Evidently, fan pressure for the bromance between Poe and Finn to spill over into something more serious had fallen on studiously deaf ears.</p> <p>Unlike Takei, Ryan seems delighted with the queer reinvention of her Star Trek character, enthusiastically tweeting out rainbow flags when the Picard season finale was released. But so far that reinvention has hinged on an ambiguous line of dialogue and another blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it moment of physical contact. In the next season, the writers will need to do much more to prove that queering such a popular character is more than just a gimmick.</p>",
  "<p><strong>I had adjusted to living alone</strong> <strong>after I was widowed six years ago, and</strong> <strong>since the lockdown</strong> <strong>friends have telephoned frequently and I</strong> <strong>chat to neighbours at a distance.</strong></p> <p><strong>Although I feel I am one of the lucky ones and should be fine, I miss, above all, </strong><strong>hugs and physical closeness. I have also started to resent people with partners</strong><strong>, children or cuddly pets (which I have n</strong><strong>ot done before).</strong></p> <p><strong>I cannot</strong> <strong>enjoy my many usual activities away from home, and without these prompts I have to make a real effort to give my day some structure. I am coping and am not especially vulnerable, but the many words written on the difficulties of being shut at home with a family are starting to make me feel invisible.</strong></p> <p>You are certainly not alone in how you feel. But while it is normal and understandable, it doesn\u2019t make it any easier to cope with. Three things jumped out at me from your letter: being widowed (my condolences), your use of the word \u201cshould\u201d, and your newfound resentment, all things I felt were worth exploring.</p> <p>I contacted Dr Heather Wood, a psychoanalyst (<a href=\"http://bpc.org.uk\" title=\"\">bpc.org.uk</a>), to help me unpick your letter. Of course, some people choose to live alone and are perfectly happy this way. But, as Wood explained, \u201cSome people have living alone forced on them by bereavement [as in your case] or relationships ending, and although they find ways of making it work, it wasn\u2019t their first choice.\u201d Wood also thought you sounded \u201cvery resourceful, but your capacity to adapt [this time] has been stretched by this extraordinary situation.\u201d</p> <p>Your letter displayed no self-pity and you sound as if you take responsibility for yourself (that\u2019s a major plus, as many don\u2019t). But your use of the word \u201cshould\u201d belied that you feel you ought to be fine, but you\u2019re not. And isn\u2019t that OK? To not feel fine, to not cope at times? Are you worried this is the new you? Because I don\u2019t think it is.</p> <p>It sounds as if you\u2019ve managed to control your feelings \u2013 of grief, loss, maybe anger and fear \u2013 until now. In lockdown, life is necessarily small and shrunken, and perhaps the negative feelings we\u2019ve managed to keep in abeyance can suddenly loom large. I think this may also explain why you are now feeling resentful of people having things you don\u2019t. This is completely understandable and not a sign of a change in your personality \u2013 rather a reaction to a very difficult, but transient, situation.</p> <p>With regard to resentment, Wood flagged something important, of which we should all take note in these days of social media, when others can appear to have a better life: \u201cEnvy can start as a sort of admiration for others but can end up with us begrudging people for what they have. Envy thrives when you can\u2019t check out the reality, and one of the things about isolation is that you can imagine everybody else is in happy families together, doing enjoyable things and that makes your aloneness feel much more painful and more acute.\u201d</p> <p>Even within these restrained times, it\u2019s important to look at what makes us feel better, what makes us feel like us. It\u2019s different for everyone. Like you, I need routine, so I\u2019ve been careful to implement one. Can you try to think of things that might make you feel better? And then work out what is achievable? (I realise hugs and physical closeness can\u2019t happen now.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/13/should-we-tell-my-grandson-his-father-is-a-drug-addict\">Should we tell my grandson his father is a drug addict?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s great that you talk to people regularly. Wood wondered if friends ask what they can do to help; might it be an idea to ask them to ring at the same time every day to give a sense of structure? I am not a fan of video calls but in these last few weeks they have been life-affirming.

  "<p>Welcome to law and order in the age of William Barr. Against the tableau of a raging pandemic and job market in freefall, on Thursday the justice department announced that it would be dropping its case against Michael Flynn, the president\u2019s short-tenured national security adviser.</p> <p>The fact that Flynn had pleaded guilty and Donald Trump had previously accused him of lying to the vice-president no longer mattered. These days, Trump was claiming that Flynn had been exonerated and, after all, Barr was the president\u2019s obedient servant. His tweets were Barr\u2019s commands.</p> <p>To be sure, Barr had already been there before with Trump and decades earlier with George HW Bush.</p> <p>Little more than a year ago, after Robert Mueller had relayed his conclusions to the justice department, Barr issued a summary that distorted the special counsel\u2019s report and turned them into a wholesale vindication of the president. When Mueller complained in writing of Barr\u2019s deceit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/19/a-very-stable-genius-review-donald-trump-leonnig-rucker-washington-post\">Barr became \u201cpissed\u201d</a>, thought Mueller\u2019s letter \u201cnasty\u201d and felt personally \u201cbetrayed\u201d. Supposedly, the two men had been friends.</p> <p>But that wasn\u2019t the end of his story. This past March, Barr also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/26/in-deep-state-review-david-rohde-donald-trump-intelligence-barack-obama\">earned the ire</a> of Reggie Walton, a George W Bush appointee to the federal bench. The judge \u201cseriously\u201d questioned Barr\u2019s integrity and credibility. The court\u2019s March 2020 <a href=\"https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/6805-judge-walton-ruling-on-barr-cr/2df9b5c6d7de0fef1e35/optimized/full.pdf#page=1\">opinion</a> deployed words like \u201cdistorted\u201d and \u201cmisleading\u201d to drive the point home, not the language generally used to describe the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer.</p> <p>To be sure, that was just another episode of Barr\u2019s fealty to Trump. In February, Barr put his finger on the scale when it came to the sentencing of Roger Stone and overrode the recommendations of career prosecutors. For his valor, Barr <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/12/trump-praises-william-barr-after-roger-stone-sentencing-reversal.html\">won the president\u2019s admiration</a>. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1227561237782855680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2020%2F02%2F12%2Ftrump-praises-william-barr-after-roger-stone-sentencing-reversal.html\">In a pre-8am tweet</a>, Trump congratulated his attorney general and trashed Mueller, accusing him of lying to Congress.</p> <p>Like Roy Cohn, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer of yore, Barr had attended Horace Mann and Columbia. History can repeat itself, in more ways than one.</p> <p>In the early 1990s, when Barr was George HW Bush\u2019s attorney general he repeatedly ran political interference for the man who hired him. Confronted with congressional demands for copies of classified documents and that Barr appoint an independent counsel to investigate Iraqgate, the extension of government credits to Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime before its invasion of Kuwait, Barr pushed back hard.</p> <p>In a rebuke to congressional oversight, Barr refused to turn over the information. In a separate letter to the House judiciary committee, Barr denied the committee\u2019s request for an independent counsel, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1992/08/11/barr-refuses-to-seek-special-counsel-on-iraq/98d669e6-6e8c-4e3c-9804-603b2267b554/?noredirect=on\">tossing around such phrases</a> as \u201cnot a crime\u201d, \u201csimply not criminal in any way\u201d, \u201cnothing illegal\u201d, and \u201cfar from being a crime\u201d. In essence, Republican presidents were legally off-limits, ditto their appointees.</p> <p>But that wasn\u2019t the end of Barr running interference for the elder Bush. After he lost his re-election bid to Bill Clinton, Barr successfully argued for the pardon of Caspar Weinberger, Ronald Reagan\u2019s defense secretary, and others in the aftermath of the Iran-Contra scandal.</p> <p>Then as now, Barr was attorney general: \u201cI favored the broadest pardon authority,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/01/14/684553791/william-barr-supported-pardons-in-an-earlier-d-c-witch-hunt-iran-contra\">said Barr</a>. He added, \u201cThere were some people just arguing just for Weinberger. I said, \u2018No \u2013 in for a penny, in for a pound.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Not every attorney general is the president\u2019s handmaiden. Likewise, not every president is determined to ride roughshod over DoJ.</p> <p>John Ashcroft, attorney general to George W Bush, refused to be steamrolled by the White House and declined to reauthorize \u201cStellar Wind\u201d, a domestic surveillance program. At the time, Ashcroft was in a hospital intensive care unit. The fact that the president\u2019s counsel and the White House chief of staff were hovering over his bed did not alter the outcome.</p> <p>Indeed, unlike Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, the younger Bush recognized that presidential pardons were not baubles. Bush commuted the prison sentence meted out to Scooter Libby, Dick Cheney\u2019s chief of staff, after a jury had convicted Libby of obstruction of justice and perjury in connection with an investigation of unauthorized leaks of the identity of Valerie Plame, a CIA officer. But despite Cheney\u2019s repeated requests for a pardon <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/magazine/the-final-insult-in-the-bush-cheney-marriage.html\">he was rebuffed</a>.</p> <p>At the time, Bill Burck, the deputy White House counsel, told the president: \u201cYou have to follow the law, and the law says if you say something that is untrue, knowingly, to a federal official in the context of a grand jury investigation and it is material to their investigation, that\u2019s a crime.\u201d</p> <p>The favoritism and unfairness of the process \u201cfrustrated\u201d Bush. Ultimately, the relationship between Bush and his vice-president took a permanent hit. As history would have it, Libby had represented Marc Rich, whose pardon further tarnished Clinton\u2019s legacy</p> <p>There is a coda. Trump subsequently pardoned Libby just as he pardoned Joe Arpaio, the Arizona sheriff found to be in contempt of court.</p> <p>For Trump, <em><a href=\"https://grammarist.com/phrase/letat-cest-moi/\">l\u2019\u00e9tat, c\u2019est moi</a></em>, and for Barr it\u2019s pretty much what a Republican president says it is.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cWill some people be affected badly?

Yet Trump has insisted \u2013 against the advice of many medical and scientific professionals \u2013 that non-essential businesses reopen early and people go back to work.</p> <p>But if Trump were a mom (or, at the very least, an involved parent), and not, say, someone who <a href=\"https://people.com/politics/fathers-day-donald-trump-quotes-raising-children/\">at one point said</a> of involved dads, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of women out there that demand that the husband act like the wife and you know there\u2019s a lot of husbands that listen to that,\u201d he would know that reopening America before experts recommend will not only pose a continued threat to public health, but will result in more lost jobs for working moms and other caregivers.</p> <p>A reported 26m jobs have been lost in just five weeks as a result of the coronavirus lockdowns, and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-unemployment-women-60-percent-2020-4\">60% of the people who have lost their job</a> are women. Moms have long been the primary caregivers of their children, and even though more moms are working outside the home and fathers are more involved in their kids\u2019 lives than ever before, moms are still shouldering the majority of the parenting responsibilities.</p> <p>With nine in 10 children out of school, and daycares across the country closed, it is moms who will likely be forced to stay home even if, and when, their jobs resume. Historically, even in non-pandemic times, it is moms who end up adjusting their jobs for the sake of their families, not dads.</p> <p>Now, arguably more than ever, we need more moms in positions of power.</p> <p>If more moms were in charge, elected officials and other leaders would know that to open up the country without also opening up schools and daycares is to put millions of women out of a job. It also means putting additional strain on low-income families \u2013 especially black families and families of color, who are already <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/05/black-counties-disproportionately-hit-by-coronavirus-237540\">disproportionately affected by Covid-19</a> \u2013 and will continue to harm the mental health of parents, whoare reportedly <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-parents-stress-066aa3e1-d1d9-4112-84ed-c65184d04e39.html\">experiencing insomnia</a>, stress, anxiety, depression, anger, emotional exhaustion and PTSD symptoms as a result of quarantine and its implications.</p> <p>It\u2019s no wonder that Nancy Pelosi, a mother of five and grandmother of nine, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/13/senior-dems-national-plan-reopen-united-states-184135\">has called</a> Trump\u2019s plan to reopen the country \u201calmost sinful\u201d. Or that the House Democrats \u2013 whose ranks, after the 2018 midterm elections, now include <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2019/02/15/congress-includes-more-mothers-with-children-at-home-than-ever-before-thats-likely-to-change-legislation/\">a record number of moms</a> \u2013 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HouseDemocrats/status/1256255831307366401?s=20\">have argued</a> that \u201creopening the country without nationwide access to testing is dangerous\u201d. The women, and especially the moms, who have managed to find a seat at the proverbial political table know what the president either refuses to acknowledge or is simply too stubborn to admit: it will be women, mothers and caregivers who will be most at risk if the country reopens prematurely. It\u2019s House Democrats who proposed a monthly stimulus check to support families while they shelter-in place, instead of a one-time $1,200 payment, argued for increasing food assistance (Snap) benefits, and fought for millions of dollars in aid to hospitals in the $484bn relief package passed in April.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Ohio \u2013 led by the Republican governor, Mike DeWine \u2013 the department of job and family services is asking businesses to report employees who refuse to return to work during a deadly global pandemic. . More than half the country is now reopening in some form.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/us/coronavirus-women-essential-workers.html\">Seventy-seven per cent of healthcare workers are women</a>. Nine in 10 nurses, respiratory therapists and nursing assistants are women. Fifty-three per cent of critical retail workers are women. In fact, women make up 52% of all essential workers, and 73% of the healthcare workers who have been infected with Covid-19. And it will be women that Trump and other Republican leaders will continue to sacrifice on the altar of consumerism if they maintain their heartless calls to reopen the country before it is safe to do so. Moms will lose their jobs, financial independence and freedom, and the gains they have made as workers outside the home.</p> <p>We need more women \u2013 especially moms, who currently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/parenting/childcare-coronavirus-moms.html\">feel as if they\u2019re working \u201cfive jobs\u201d</a> to maintain a semblance of normalcy \u2013 in leadership positions to help this country navigate such an unparalleled moment in world history. We could have had a mom in the White House after the 2016 presidential election. We could have had a mom in the White House in January 2021. But the absence of both those possibilities, coupled with the tragedy we\u2019re all enduring and the cruelty and cold indifference of the men in charge, should serve as a reminder that this country would be better off, in more ways than one, if it was led by a mom.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"http://drjessicazucker.com\">Jessica Zucker</a> is a Los Angeles-based psychologist specializing in women\u2019s health, and the author of the forthcoming book I Had a Miscarriage: a Memoir, a Movement (Feminist Press, 2021)</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Her only companions are darting lizards and the crested partridges that scrabble around her feet as she does the watering or tries to keep on top of the weeding. Background noise is the burble of a waterfall and birdsong.</p> <p>The lockdown has forced many people to work alone, but few can be operating in such splendid, spectacular isolation as Lucie Oldale at the Eden Project in Cornwall.</p> <p>As a specialist horticulturalist, she spends her working days among more than 1,000 species in the huge biome that houses <a href=\"https://www.edenproject.com/visit/whats-here/rainforest-biome\">the world\u2019s biggest indoor rainforest</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite a bizarre experience,\u201d said Oldale, 32 and originally from Edinburgh. \u201cUsually at this time of year it\u2019s really busy with visitors. Now it\u2019s just me.\u201d </p> <p>She says does miss the crowds, but that it\u2019s amazing to be in there alone.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so privileged to have this brilliant space to myself with all the plants doing their thing, no matter what humans are up to outside. Spring is a beautiful time of year in the rainforest. The plants are enjoying high light levels and longer days. Everything is bursting into life.\u201d</p> <p>She concedes it can be spooky at times. \u201cYou\u2019ll be in your bubble doing something then realise you haven\u2019t seen or spoken to anyone for the whole day.\u201d</p> <p>However, she isn\u2019t completely alone. Small green anole lizards and geckos appear as if by magic, then vanish in a flash. \u201cBecause it\u2019s been so sunny, warm and quiet there are lots of them around. I\u2019ve had a fright a few times when pruning or cutting and one of them has appeared. They are very well camouflaged and you can get a fright when you come across one unexpectedly.\u201d</p> <p>Roul-rouls \u2013 the crested partridges \u2013 also keep Oldale on her toes. \u201cThey run around all over the place. They have been pairing off for the season. I\u2019m expecting the first chicks any day.\u201d Other birds in the biome include white eyes from Indonesia and blackbirds and robins that have found their way into the biome.</p> <p>Cockroaches are occasionally spotted, but nothing bigger. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a big spider, thankfully. Sometimes I think if this was the real jungle you wouldn\u2019t be rummaging around the way we do.\u201d</p> <p>Oldale works a normal eight-hour shift each day. Happily, Eden has just installed a new automatic watering system. \u201cOtherwise I\u2019d be spending the whole time watering,\u201d she said. \u201cI can even operate it from my phone.\u201d</p> <p>Still, she has to spend a couple of hours every morning watering the hard-to-reach areas \u2013 and an awful lot of time weeding. \u201cThe weeds are going crazy this year.

Staff are not allowed to eat any of the fruit that grows in the biome. \u201cBut perhaps in a global pandemic you can bend the rules a bit,\u201d said Oldale. She is particularly keen on the idea of making a green papaya salad. \u201cYou harvest it before it turns orange and grate it. It\u2019s good with a little lime juice.\u201d</p> <p>Competition for the fruit is fierce, though. \u201cThe birds keep their eyes on it. You have to be pretty quick to beat them.\u201d</p> <p>A huge treat is clearing out the pools. During this fine spring the biomes have reached temperatures of more than 40C, but the water is nice and cool. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely shorts and T-shirt conditions. Sometimes I think I could get along with even less because I\u2019m alone,\u201d Oldale says with a twinkle in her voice.</p> <p>Other jobs include keeping a record of what work needs to be done to allow visitors back in. \u201cBecause the biome has really been heating up, the vents have started opening automatically to control the temperature. Open vents create air movement and this paired with new growth is a bad combination, resulting in lots of snapped limbs.</p> <p>\u201cI have been monitoring the trees carefully, keeping the biome safe and pruning any snaps I am able to reach. I can\u2019t do a lot of tree work alone so I have been keeping a record of all the jobs we will be able to do when the team is back. We\u2019ll use a cherrypicker and even work from ropes to make the rainforest safe before we invite the public back.\u201d</p> <p>Usually pests are controlled by releasing predatory and parasitoid bio-controls \u2013 insects that like to eat or parasitise the main pest species such as aphids, scale insects and mealybugs. \u201cThis is not possible right now, so as an alternative I have been clearing out annual crop displays and cutting back as much herbaceous material as I can. This will reduce food sources for pests and help me to keep the biome clean and tidy.\u201d</p> <p>Oldale\u2019s situation has some parallels with the ecologist in the 1972 film Silent Running, who are alone in outer space with a dome filled with forest trees saved from Earth. \u201cEveryone is feeling isolated in some way,\u201d said Oldale. \u201cI\u2019m very happy to keep the biome going for when visitors can return.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>There\u2019s nothing like a global pandemic when you want to slip a contentious planning application in under the radar.

It looks like the compromised result of design-by-committee, employing a plethora of materials and awkward angles in a vain attempt to break up the lumpen mass. Public reaction has been caustic. \u201cThey\u2019re proposing to build something from scratch that looks like the result of multiple awkward extensions to a 1970s shopping centre,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adambanksdotcom/status/1257279247254781952\">commented one Twitter user</a>.

For almost two decades, the heart of Gateshead\u2019s waterfront has been scarred by a great windswept wasteland. On one side stands the Sage, a divisive building \u2013 variously compared to a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/tyne/content/articles/2004/12/13/sage_gateshead_have_your_say_feature.shtml\">metallic peanut and a swollen slug</a> \u2013 but one that seems to unite all opinions with its world-class acoustics. It was designed by Norman Foster in the early 2000s, at around the same time that he was conjuring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/oct/17/norman-foster-president-pyramid-architects-built-astana\">vanity monuments for central Asian autocrats</a>, and it has always seemed cast adrift, marooned up a slope on the edge of a car park.</p> <p>Across the other side of the windswept tarmac expanse, down several flights of stairs, across a road and down yet more steps, stands the Baltic, a 1950s flour mill transformed into a gallery in the Tate Modern mould, opened in 2002. Together with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2001/sep/24/architecture.artsfeatures\">winking Millennium Bridge</a>, which cleverly pivots to let boat traffic through, these projects were an impressive symbol of Gateshead\u2019s culture-led regeneration programme during the New Labour years \u2013 only let down by the great unplanned mess between them.</p> <p>\u201cWe always held it up as an example for our students,\u201d says Mark Tewdwr-Jones, professor of town planning at Newcastle University, \u201cof how not to do planning. That site has been a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for planning disasters.\u201d</p> <p>While the Newcastle side of the river was subject to a Terry Farrell masterplan, led by the former Tyne &amp; Wear Development Corporation in the 1990s, the Gateshead side never had an overarching idea in place. John Devlin, Gateshead council\u2019s development director at the time, says the Sage and Baltic were conceived as \u201canchor tenants\u201d that would then encourage private development for the space in between. In 2004, Taylor Woodrow built an S-shaped flank of cheap-looking apartment blocks that loom <a href=\"http://idpartnership.com/portfolio/housing/baltic-quays/\">immediately behind the Baltic</a>, but their plans to continue across the rest of the site ran out of steam. Other proposals came and went over the years, but nothing stuck.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74d24d02456e4ade613897587330ca3069f1eb81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74d24d02456e4ade613897587330ca3069f1eb81/0_485_4900_2939/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trinity Square shopping centre\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harbinger of doom \u2026 the unpopular Trinity Square shopping centre, built in 2013</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Islandstock/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe could never make it stack up,\u201d says Peter Udall, director of economy, innovation and growth at Gateshead council. \u201cWe have long had the ambition for a conference centre on this site, but we could never find the right operator. This is about the third attempt to get something that works.\u201d</p> <p>Following an open <a href=\"https://www.ojeu.eu/\">OJEU tender</a> process, developer Ask Real Estate and German investment manager Patrizia were selected to work with the council to bring forward plans for the site. As the duo behind Manchester\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/15/manchesters-25m-home-sorely-missed-architectural-opportunity\">uninspiring First Street development</a>, where the cut-price arts venue Home is hemmed in by a tacky hotel and offices, it is not an auspicious choice.</p> <p>\u201cIt was going to be a rather safe mixed-use development with offices and hotels,\u201d says Udall, \u201cbut then SMG [an arena-operating firm, now known as ASM Global] came on board and it became far more ambitious.\u201d ASM currently operates the <a href=\"https://www.utilitaarena.co.uk/\">Utilita arena</a> (formerly the Metro Radio arena) across the river in Newcastle and intends to shift its operations to the new complex in 2023, if the project goes ahead.</p> <p>The resulting design betrays the piecemeal nature of its evolution, with AHR architects in charge of the boxy hotel and HOK attempting to cram the rest of the facilities on the steeply sloping site, linked by a clumsy series of terraces and steps. In an attempt not to drown out the \u201ciconic\u201d status of its illustrious neighbours, the architects have resorted to a language of banal blocks, jazzed up in places with jaunty angles and faceted rooftops, wrapped in a busy palette of brick, slate, concrete, glass, Corten steel and expanded metal mesh \u2013 the latter material listed as \u201cto disguise\u201d, as if in the hope that people might not notice the hulking great pile.</p> <p>In the <a href=\"https://public.gateshead.gov.uk/online-applications/caseDetails.do?caseType=Application&amp;keyVal=Q93DO9HK0E000\">planning application</a>, the architects describe how brick is used to \u201cdraw on the industrial heritage of the site\u201d while the roof of the squat river-facing block has a \u201csawtooth movement leading to a gradual crescendo\u201d towards the Sage. \u201cThe organisation and massing of the large scale components has been carefully curated to complement the immediate context and neighbouring buildings,\u201d they continue, in garbled platitudes. \u201cThe expression of the buildings take visitors on a cognitive journey through the site and give clues to the usage and communicates to the visitor at each interface.\u201d By attempting to be both landmark building and background filler, the only journey the architects offer is a one-way ticket to cognitive dissonance.</p> <p>The council is in a bind. While the Sage, the Baltic and the Millennium Bridge were all the result of international design competitions, and led by the council, for this project it has handed over control to the private sector, with predictable results.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b45073cea247ff17ec4d54ba606bad068aa9a27\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b45073cea247ff17ec4d54ba606bad068aa9a27/9_0_3850_2310/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clog on the Tyne \u2026 a rendering of Gateshead Quays from the waterfront.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clog on the Tyne \u2026 a rendering of Gateshead Quays from the waterfront.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of HOK</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe process is very different,\u201d says Udall. \u201cWe were the client for the other three projects and were a lot more involved in the detail of the brief. With the arena and conference centre, we feel we can still maintain our influence, but the choice of architect is up to Ask and Patrizia.\u201d</p> <p>Why not insist on an architectural competition, given it is such a prominent site? The complex will be centre stage in views from the Tyne Bridge, and confront anyone looking across the river from Newcastle for generations. \u201cI think we\u2019d have lost the developer if we had insisted on going down the competition route,\u201d says Udall. \u201cIt\u2019s such a massive building with so many commercial constraints for the operator. A grain of sand can derail this kind of project.\u201d</p> <p>In the calibre of its design, the proposals sadly call to mind the Trinity Square development nearby. Once home to <a href=\"https://c20society.org.uk/lost-modern/trinity-square-car-park-gateshead\">Owen Luder\u2019s brutalist car park</a>, featured in the 1971 film Get Carter, it was demolished to make way for a comically bad Tesco with student flats on top, shortlisted for the <a href=\"https://www.bdonline.co.uk/buildings/carbuncle-cup-trinity-square-gateshead/5070309.article\">Carbuncle Cup in 2014</a>. As Owen Hatherley <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/27/brutal-unrepentant\">wrote at the time</a>: \u201cWith this demolition, we\u2019re exchanging architecture as a physical experience for buildings as a mute, grinning, lobotomised accompaniment to consumerism.\u201d</p> <p>It is true that development economics in Gateshead are not comparable to London or Manchester. The town centre is full of vacant retail units, while half of the population has a total household income of under \u00a330,000. The local authority clearly has more urgent priorities. But that\u2019s no excuse to see the waterfront desecrated with such mediocre fare. Enjoying the rare position of being a major landowner, and having a recent history of commissioning brave buildings for the arts, Gateshead council must have the confidence to insist on better.</p>",

The latest jobs losses are the worst monthly figure on record. The closest comparison came in 1933 when unemployment hit an estimated 25% but that was before the government began publishing official statistics.</p> <p>The previous peak for unemployment was 10.8% in 1982 and the largest monthly job loss, close to 2million, came in September 1945 at the end of the second world war, when the country was demobilizing. April\u2019s job losses also easily eclipsed the 800,000 jobs lost in March 2009, the height of the last recession.</p> <p>The job losses swept across the economy, hitting all industries. Leisure and hospitality lost 7.7m jobs as the sector was hit hard by quarantine measures. But 2.5m jobs were also lost in education and health services, where dentist offices shed 503,000 people. Retail lost 2.1m jobs and manufacturing employment dropped by 1.3m.</p> <p>Unemployment for African Americans soared from 6.7% last month to 16.7%, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/28/african-americans-unemployment-covid-19-economic-impact\">wiping out all of the gains</a> made since the last recession. For white Americans unemployment also rose sharply, from 4% to 14.2%. Some 6 million people dropped out of the labor force during the month \u2013 meaning they stopped looking for work.</p> <p>The labor force participation rate \u2013 which measures the percentage of the population working or looking for work \u2013 dropped 2.5% over the month to 60.2%, the lowest rate since January 1973.</p> <p>\u201cThese are truly mind-blowing numbers,\u201d said Jason Reed, professor of finance at the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Mendoza College of Business. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen anything like this since the Great Depression.\u201d</p> <p>The figures probably undercount the true impact of the outbreak as state unemployment offices have been overwhelmed and millions have yet to have their benefit claims accepted.</p> <p>\u201cThe employment situation report confirms what we already know about the economy. Regardless of the official number, we know that one in five workers filed for unemployment insurance. This is a staggering,\u201d said Reed.</p> <p>Friday\u2019s report follows the news on Thursday that another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/07/us-unemployment-jobless-coronavirus-economy\">3.2 million Americans</a> filed for unemployment benefits last week. The number of filings has been declining on a weekly basis but remains at a historically high level.

  "<p>Thanks to the ridiculous popularity of gin (even in these times, I\u2019m still discovering new ones), tonic has had a corresponding boom. But, assuming you can lay your hands on some, you can make equally refreshing, cheaper and less alcoholic drinks by mixing your tonic with sherry, white port or vermouth (the latter is also good with a splash of soda, by the way).</p> <p>Supermarkets do remarkably well-priced, own-label vermouths with which it\u2019s well worth experimenting. Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s, for example, both sell their own bianco for \u00a35.85 a litre, or much the same price as a still wine, and at just under 15%, it will go quite a bit further. A bianco with plenty of ice, a good slosh of soda (50:50) and a slice of orange is really reinvigorating. If you have a drier palate, I\u2019d recommend trying the more elegant, floral <strong>Chamb\u00e9ry</strong> (see panel below).</p> <p>I\u2019ve also been majorly into sherry and tonic, or \u201cShe &amp; T\u201d, lately, a slightly more sophisticated version of southern Spain\u2019s favourite summer drink, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/may/10/cocktail-of-the-week-olly-smiths-rebujito\">rebujito</a> (which is diluted with 7-Up or Sprite). You don\u2019t want to use the best or the driest sherry you have, but equally not the cheapest or sweetest, either. I\u2019ve been making mine with <strong><a href=\"https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/299817671\">Tesco\u2019s Finest Fino</a></strong> (\u00a36 a half bottle, 15%) ) \u2013 again, about half-and-half with a decent amount of ice (at least four or five cubes) and a slice of lemon. (Not a view universally shared, it appears: I see one customer has given it only one star on the supermarket\u2019s website.)</p> <p>In terms of using tonic as a mixer, it\u2019s worth being aware of the different levels of sugar in different brands \u2013 even slimline ones. Schweppes, for example, has just under 5g per 100ml in its standard Indian tonic water, while Fever-Tree has 7.1g, but no added sweeteners, while its \u201crefreshingly light\u201d version still has 2.9g sugar and you could easily be drinking twice that amount.</p> <p>For that reason, I often prefer diluting drinks with club soda or soda water (basically water to which sodium bicarbonate has been added), which is sugar-free. It definitely works better with cordials and shrubs, bitter drinks such as Campari and Aperol, and dry white wine \u2013 the classic spritzer \u2013 because it leaves the flavour of the underlying drink unchanged (and if you\u2019re clean out of soda, sparkling water can do much the same job). I think they work best with fruity whites and ros\u00e9s, rather than reds, though I\u2019m not averse to dropping a couple of ice cubes into a light red to chill it down. After all, there are no guests around at the moment to be horrified.</p> <h2>Five drinks to dilute</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"small spacer -- 12 pixels -- to separate the header  from the first wine bottle pic and its and text.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 12px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2b139a15655b172ea21a708147318c301e312f36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b139a15655b172ea21a708147318c301e312f36/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gonzalez Byass Elegante fino sherry.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gonzalez Byass Elegante fino sherry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Gonzalez Byass Elegante Fino</strong> </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/gonzalez-byass-elegante-fino-sherry/064012-32499-32500\">\u00a39.99 Waitrose</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ocado.com/products/elegante-fino-sherry-gonzalez-byass-16771011\">Ocado</a>, 15%.</p> <p>A better sherry for a She &amp; T than the bracingly dry Tio Pepe, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not classy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 32px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 32px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b6124a9bc52fc267909416e7f2b4589be82ac432\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6124a9bc52fc267909416e7f2b4589be82ac432/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martini Non-alcoholic Vibrante copy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Martini Non-Alcoholic Vibrante</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ocado.com/products/martini-dolce-0-0-alcohol-free-italian-sparkling-459929011\">\u00a310 Ocado</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/p/53940/martini-vibrante-non-alcoholic-aperitif\">\u00a310.95 The Whisky Exchange</a>.</p> <p>Hooray for a sophisticated \u201capero\u201d with a proper touch of bitterness.

  "<p>Anglers, game shooting enthusiasts and bowls clubs are increasing the pressure for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/05/longer-lockdown-for-over-70s-would-allow-fewer-restrictions-for-rest-of-uk-scientists-suggest\">lockdown to be eased</a> for their sports, arguing that they can resume them while remaining physically distanced.</p> <p>Lobbyists for fishing and game shooting claim that continuing strict lockdown restrictions for their pursuits could cost the UK economy millions of pounds and lead to thousands of job losses.</p> <p>They also warn that the disappearance from the countryside of sportspeople during lockdown is leading to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/05/longer-lockdown-for-over-70s-would-allow-fewer-restrictions-for-rest-of-uk-scientists-suggest\">rise in rural crime</a> and having a negative impact on conservation.</p> <p>Meanwhile, greens are being lovingly prepared and committee members thinking about ways of operating in a post-lockdown world as the sport of bowls makes tentative preparations for a comeback.</p> <p>Martin Salter, the head of policy at the <a href=\"https://www.anglingtrust.net/\">Angling Trust</a>, said fishing had been \u201cincredibly responsible\u201d in persuading the UK\u2019s many hundreds of thousands of anglers to stay away from the water during lockdown.</p> <p>But he said: \u201cI think we have a compelling case now for us to be at the very front of the queue when the government and its advisers decide the time is right to begin ratcheting back the restrictions.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a52a33288e01b60b1e45f7199565dc0e9c88a04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a52a33288e01b60b1e45f7199565dc0e9c88a04/0_283_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angler Marina Gibson with Claire Mercer Nairn on the Tay in Perth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angler Marina Gibson with Claire Mercer Nairn on the Tay in Perth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Angling Trust has submitted a three-phase plan called <a href=\"https://joinanglingtrust.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/When-We-Fish-Again-Report-14.pdf\">When We Fish Again</a> to the government spelling out how it believes fishing could return safely.</p> <p>Phase one would include angling being undertaken on a solitary basis close to home. The second phase suggests reintroducing charter boat and competition fishing \u2013 but only if guidelines can be followed. The final phase would involve a fuller resumption of the sport, again respecting any restrictions.</p> <p>The industry says fishing contributes around \u00a34bn annually to the UK economy, supporting more than 40,000 jobs. There have been dire warnings that businesses will go under and jobs lost if the sport does not resume soon.</p> <p>Across the country\u2019s waterways, there have been reports of increases in vandalism and poaching. Danny Fairbrass, whose company runs 25 lakes, said: \u201cAlmost every one has been vandalised or fished illegally during lockdown. With fishing safely re-introduced this would eradicate all of these issues overnight.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, country estates are planning to reduce the number of days they organise when the grouse, partridge and pheasant seasons begin later this year.</p> <p>Jon Fuller, the head keeper at an estate in Shropshire that runs pheasant and partridge shoots in the autumn, said it was planning to press ahead with 60% of its normal activities.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very uncertain times.\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that we will be able to do some shooting but we can\u2019t say for certain how much. We\u2019ve got to scale back a bit.\u201d</p> <p>Like the Angling Trust, the <a href=\"https://basc.org.uk/\">British Association for Shooting and Conservation (BASC)</a> is drawing up plans for how game shoots later this year can be carried out if physical distancing rules remain in place.</p> <p>BASC says that shooting contributes \u00a32bn into the UK economy annually and provides the equivalent of 74,000 full-time jobs.</p> <p>In the world of bowls, many players and some administrators are arguing that the nature of their sport means the comforting clack of bowl on bowl may be heard in sunlit parks by mid-summer.</p> <p>\u201cWe tick the box for non-contact and we play outdoors,\u201d said Alistair Hollis, the operational services manager at <a href=\"https://www.bowlsengland.com/\">Bowls England</a>. \u201cWith a degree of initiative and innovation, social distancing shouldn\u2019t be too much of a problem.\u201d</p> <p>In normal times as many as 48 people routinely play on one green but Hollis said the number would almost certainly have to be severely restricted with perhaps just one-on-one or pair games played rather than team versions. Appointment systems and time restrictions may have to be introduced and rules on not sharing equipment brought in.</p> <p>\u201cOne of our biggest selling points is that we are a family sport that can be played by all ages together,\u201d said Hollis. \u201cIf the same households are allowed to play something together, our sport may fit the bill. A game of bowls in the middle of July with our family might be an attractive proposition.\u201d</p> <p>Craig McGuigan, the chairman of the <a href=\"https://bowlingresults.co.uk/britishparks/\">British Parks Crown Green Bowling Association</a>, acknowledges that there are possible hitches. \u201cThe sport is non-contact but people do usually handle things like the jack, the mat. We may have to look at ways of making sure we can wash equipment. We need to find ways of looking after one another.\u201d</p> <p>No bowls is currently being played in the UK. Mark Bircumshaw, chief executive of the British Crown Green Bowling Association, was more cautious about the prospect of a return soon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbbbf4e713c8087d4a0ec24d4fffdf36f964c420\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbbbf4e713c8087d4a0ec24d4fffdf36f964c420/0_1243_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Game Shooting\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The British Association for Shooting and Conservation is drawing up plans for physically distanced shoots.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Apogee/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe are following government guidance. I don\u2019t expect much broadening of what we can do after Sunday,\u201d he said. Bircumshaw pointed out that many bowls players were over 70. \u201cWe have to do the right thing for our elderly population,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The Isle of Man might lead the bowls comeback in the British Isles. Its governing body has written to its government setting out proposals for how it could return. It is confident that a <a href=\"http://www.iombowls.com/festival/\">bowls festival in September</a> that attracts hundreds of bowlers from across the UK will go ahead.</p> <p>Richard Potton, captain of Newport Pagnell bowls club in Buckinghamshire, said its greens had been kept in tip-top condition. \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking after them during lockdown,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe we\u2019ll be back by mid-July. If the professional footballers are being allowed to play, why shouldn\u2019t we? We can\u2019t wait to get back.\u201d</p>",

His senseless straight red card for a rash challenge 75 minutes in ultimately helped cost his side a share of the spoils.

  "<p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales\">New South Wales</a> police watchdog investigation into seven strip searches including one in which a 16-year-old Aboriginal boy was physically forced to remove his shorts and squat has found that all of them were unlawful.</p> <p>But the watchdog has been criticised for \u201cnot going far enough\u201d in its findings, with Sarah Crellin, a principal solicitor at the Aboriginal Legal Service, saying she was \u201cdeeply disappointed that there have been no recommendations for disciplinary action\u201d against individual officers.</p> <p>On Friday the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission released the findings of five separate investigations into seven strip searches conducted between March 2015 and January 2019.</p> <p>In one of the investigations, the LECC found that a search in which a 16-year-old Aboriginal boy was forcibly made to squat by a NSW police sergeant was unlawful and revealed wide-spread failures in the training of police.</p> <p>\u201cThis investigation demonstrates that whatever educational methods are being utilised by the NSWPF to inform officers of their powers and responsibilities \u2026 they are not being universally applied in the practice of policing,\u201d it stated.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/07/why-is-this-happening-shocking-evidence-builds-pressure-for-strip-search-reform-in-nsw\">'Why is this happening?' Shocking evidence builds pressure for strip-search reform in NSW</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On 25 November, 2018, the boy was carrying two grams of cannabis inside a cigar-shaped foil while walking with two friends on a main street \u201cof a major town in regional north-western NSW\u201d.</p> <p>When he saw two officers approaching, the boy dropped the foil then picked it up and placed it in his pocket. One of the officers, a sergeant, mistakenly believed he had seen the boy put the cannabis down the back of his shorts.</p> <p>Bodyworn camera footage reviewed by the LECC shows the boy was then stopped by the officers, who told his friends to leave. As he did, the boy shouted for them to tell his father what had happened.</p> <p>Less than two minutes after he had been stopped, the sergeant told the boy to put his hands against a fence and then \u201cbegan to pull the waistband of [the boy\u2019s] shorts out so that he could look into the back of his pants,\u201d an action which constitutes a strip search.</p> <p>The boy objected to the search, saying to the officer \u201cyou can\u2019t look down my pants cunt\u201d and then \u201cWhat are you doin\u2019, you can\u2019t put your hands down my bum ... you can search me down at the station when my parents are there\u201d.</p> <p>The officer replied: \u201cWell, you actually don\u2019t know the rules, we can search you.\u201d</p> <p>In NSW, police are only permitted to carry out field strip-searches if the urgency and seriousness of the situation requires it. In the case of minors, a parent or guardian must be present unless an immediate search is deemed necessary to protect the person or prevent evidence being destroyed.</p> <p>In its report, the LECC stated the sergeant \u201cwould later concede that it was he who did not know the rules and that [the 16-year-old boy\u2019s] understanding was correct\u201d.</p> <p>Less than four minutes after he was stopped, two more officers arrived at the scene. One of them, a constable, said to the boy: \u201cI\u2019m taking it out for you, am I?\u201d</p> <p>What the constable then did was not captured by the bodyworn camera, but after again failing to find the cannabis, the boy was handcuffed and placed in the back of a police van before being taken to the station.</p> <p>Once there, he was again searched in the presence of two officers while in the vehicle dock. Footage released by the LECC shows the sergeant checking the boy\u2019s pockets before untying the draw string of his shorts.</p> <p>\u201cHe pulled [the boy\u2019s] shorts down to the floor, lifted the back of his T-shirt and then pushed [his] right shoulder down in order to force him to squat,\u201d the LECC\u2019s report stated.</p> <p>During the LECC\u2019s investigation, the boy gave evidence that when one of the officers examined his clothing \u201che made a rude remark regarding the state of his shorts\u201d. The LECC said the boy was \u201cembarrassed by [the officer\u2019s] comments and also by having to stand naked except for his shoes and T-shirt\u201d.</p> <p>During the search, one of the officers inspected the rear of the police van and found the cannabis. The LECC\u2019s report stated the sergeant \u201cconceded in evidence that, if he had searched this area first, he would have found the foil\u201d. The boy was then questioned about the cannabis for about 30 seconds while he was still naked from the waist down. He also conceded that if he had conducted an adequate pat-down at the scene he likely would have found the cannabis in his pocket.</p> <p>The boy was charged by the sergeant with possession of two grams of cannabis and released on strict bail conditions. He was later fined in the children\u2019s court.</p> <p>The LECC\u2019s report was critical of a number of aspects of both searches. The officers argued during the investigation that they did not wait for the boy\u2019s father to arrive before searching him because they were concerned about the potential for evidence to be destroyed.</p> <p>But the LECC dismissed their arguments, pointing out that the boy had been surrounded by multiple officers at all times during his detainment.</p> <p>\u201cThis was not because of an actual belief that [the boy] would conceal evidence, but arose from their complete absence of knowledge of or disregard for the statutory requirement to have a parent or guardian present,\u201d the LECC stated.</p> <p>\u201cAny fear that [he] might conceal the drug after he had arrived in the vehicle dock was not a proper or even credible justification for breaching this provision.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/05/ses-not-happy-its-volunteers-used-during-strip-search-of-children-at-music-festival-inquiry-told\">SES 'not happy' its volunteers used during strip-search of children at music festival, inquiry told</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It also found the sergeant breached the police powers act when he forced the boy to squat, and by questioning him during the search.</p> <p>Despite that, the LECC declined to recommend disciplinary actions against any of the officers involved in the search, instead saying only that the four officers had \u201cengaged in conduct which amounted to unsatisfactory performance\u201d and blaming inadequate training.</p> <p>\u201cGiven the commission\u2019s findings regarding the absence of effective training of these officers, leading to ineffective practice in policing, the commission was not persuaded that these obvious failures of performance amounted to serious misconduct,\u201d it stated.</p> <p>The failure to recommend disciplinary action against individual officers involved in any of the five investigations has been criticised by the Aboriginal Legal Service. Crellin, who heads the criminal law practice at the ALS, said that while she welcomed the release of the reports, the findings \u201cdo not go far enough\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe LECC report and deeply disturbing video footage released today highlights what we\u2019ve known for a long time \u2013 strip searches are a deeply intrusive, disempowering and degrading process,\u201d she said. <br> \u201cWhilst the LECC Reports make findings of both inappropriate and serious misconduct by Police, we are deeply disappointed that there have been no recommendations for disciplinary action. \u201cAboriginal people and communities are too often the targets of discrimination and over-policing. And the excessive use of strip-searching is causing significant emotional and psychological harm in Aboriginal communities, particularly for children and young people. There must be accountability for mistreatment.\u201d</p> <p>The findings are part of its ongoing investigation into the use of the controversial practice in NSW, which last year held public hearings into the search of a 16-year-old girl who was left fearful and in tears after she was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/21/police-strip-searched-16-year-old-girl-at-splendour-music-festival-inquiry-hears\">forced to strip naked in front of police at the Splendour in the Grass Festival in Byron Bay</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/02/nsw-police-told-15-year-old-lift-your-balls-up-strip-search-no-adult\">three boys aged 15, 16 and 17 who were strip searched at an underage music festival in Sydney</a>.</p> <p>They are the first to be released since the former commissioner of the LECC, Michael Adams QC, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/06/strip-search-inquiry-cut-short-after-nsw-government-sacks-commissioner\">was sensationally sacked by the NSW government in the middle of the inquiry</a>.</p> <p>The reports, which were all released simultaneously on Friday afternoon, found all of those searches were conducted unlawfully. The LECC found multiple failures in the guidance provided to officers about when strip searches should be conducted at music festivals, a lack of education and training among officers and inadequate recording and insufficient privacy during searches.</p> <p>In a statement accompanying the release of the reports, the LECC said its investigations had found \u201cthat the involved police lacked the appropriate understanding of the legal requirements regarding the conduct of strip searches and had not received adequate training\u201d.</p> <p>But it said it was \u201csatisfied\u201d with the response from the police.</p> <p>\u201cThe commission has been in dialogue with NSWPF about these issues and is satisfied that measures are being taken to address the commission\u2019s concerns,\u201d it stated.</p> <p>\u201cThe progress of these measures will be further considered in the commission\u2019s final report on strip searching which is expected to be presented in the second half of 2020.\u201d</p>",

<p>On Friday morning, Gold Coast Suns captain <strong>David Swallow</strong> questioned whether flu vaccinations should be compulsory in the AFL if players weren\u2019t comfortable with them.</p> \n   <p>The NRL had amended its original waiver form on Thursday after several players refused to sign it on religious or conscientious grounds.</p> \n   <p>On Friday, three Gold Coast Titans players, including <strong>Bryce Cartwrigh</strong>t, were stood down by the NRL for refusing to take the flu shot, on the advice of Queensland health officials.</p> \n   <p>The other two players were believed to be <strong>Nathan Peats</strong> and <strong>Brian Kelly</strong>.</p> \n   <p>Peats later said on Twitter he was not anti-vaccination and had avoided the flu jab due to an adverse experience while at South Sydney back in 2012 \u2013 but was now planning to have the shot on Friday afternoon.</p> \n   <p>Earlier on Friday, Prime Minister <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> backed any decision by

In an open letter to NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian, it complained that tenants had heard that they couldn\u2019t be evicted and gone on rent strike. </p> \n  <p>It also complained that the <strong>Tenants Union</strong> had been given $250,000 to help tenants but \u201cno similar funding has been provided to support landlords\u201d. </p> \n  <p>State governments have given landlords hit by Covid-19 tax breaks, but landlords say this won\u2019t fill the gap.

  "<p>Julian Perry Robinson, who has died aged 78, combined academic research with behind-the-scenes advocacy to enhance controls on some of the most inhumane weapons in the world. His focus was on issues related to chemical and biological warfare (CBW) and the international efforts to eradicate the use or possession of such weapons.</p> <p>In the late 1960s, with cold war differences between the major powers on the control of biological weapons, he examined the challenges of CBW in factual terms rather than the rhetoric of the time. A key concept Julian promoted \u2013 that all disease-causing organisms and the toxins they produce should be considered biological weapons, unless held for clearly peaceful purposes \u2013 became the core of the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention, the first treaty to ban a whole class of weapons of mass destruction. This concept, which became known as the \u201cgeneral purpose criterion\u201d, has meant the convention has not been overtaken by scientific and technological developments.</p> <p>As a leading member of the <a href=\"https://pugwash.org/category/chemical-and-biological-weapons/\">specialised study groups</a> within the annual <a href=\"https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1998.tb09155.x\">Pugwash</a> conferences for scientists interested in international security issues, he was able to bring experts and policymakers from east and west together in informal settings. Julian helped generate the common understanding in the Geneva negotiations that resulted in the Biological Weapons Convention. </p> <p>He was also a member of the expert groups advising the UN secretary-general and the World Health Organization (WHO) on CBW issues, and was the anonymous lead author for influential reports from each, but the most visible aspect of his work at this time was his contribution to The Problem of Chemical and Biological Warfare, a six-volume study published between 1971 and 1975 by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) and still regarded as a classic text in the field.</p> <p>It was symbolic of the growth in his reputation over time that while the 1970 WHO study Public Health Response to Biological and Chemical Weapons \u2013 WHO Guidance was published anonymously, the 2004 follow-up explicitly named Julian as executive editor. Embodied in this work is the concept that the best counter to deliberately caused disease (which is what biological weapons are tools for) is to have effective measures against naturally occurring disease. Julian\u2019s death from Covid-19, an infectious disease the spread of which might have been limited with more effective measures, is thus a bitter irony.</p> <p> The adoption of the Biological Weapons Convention moved the international focus to the need for a Chemical Weapons Convention, but this took a further two decades to negotiate. Julian was used as a trusted resource by officials from many governments. International treaties require national implementation. Julian provided briefings that were quoted during the parliamentary debates on the bill that brought the convention\u2019s provisions into law in the UK. The briefings prevented a weakening of the UK\u2019s national provisions. The resulting Chemical Weapons Act of 1996 established a government advisory committee to which Julian was one of the first appointees.</p> <p>The son of Marguerite (nee Downing) and John Perry Robinson, Julian was born in Jerusalem, Palestine, where his father was a British official with the Mandate government. He attended Canford school in Dorset, and had an early interest in chemistry \u2013 his sister, Harriett, recalled him setting off colourful home-made smoke bombs as a teenager. He went on to study the subject at Oxford, graduating in 1964. His dissertation title was Some Aspects of Chemical Warfare: An Investigation into the Influence of the Second World War on the Development of Chemistry, With Particular Reference to the War Gases, an early indication of the path his career would take.</p> <p>He studied national and international patent law with Kilburn &amp; Strode Chartered Patent Agents in London from 1964 to 1968. The twin perspectives of chemistry and law provided him with insights into how effective legal constraints on CBW could be constructed.</p> <p>Julian\u2019s early career, from 1968 until 1971, was in Sweden at SIPRI, where he met his partner Mary Kaldor. In 1971, they both moved to the University of Sussex and joined the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU), which became a leading centre of study on CBW issues. Julian cemented a long-time research partnership with the Harvard University biologist Matthew Meselson through the establishment in the 1990s of the Harvard Sussex Program, which they co-directed.</p> <p>At Sussex, where Julian was appointed professor in 2001, he created a unique archive which underpinned the evidence base of his work and which remains as a legacy of his insights. This extensive archive attracted scholars from around the world as well as benefiting his own research students \u2013 many of whom moved on to key positions in academia and inter-governmental organisations. </p> <p>The rigour of his scholarship gave him confidence in challenging established assumptions or spurious policy positions. In 1981, when the US accused the Soviet Union of contravening the Biological Weapons Convention by supplying and using a biological weapon dubbed \u201cYellow Rain\u201d in south-east Asia, Julian and Meselson were able to show that the observed phenomenon of yellow spots falling from the sky came from hives of bees collectively defecating from above the tree level. This episode illustrated the need for careful analysis in an area rife with propaganda and unresolved accusations.</p> <p>Seemingly effortlessly polite, Julian could calmly deconstruct flawed arguments with precision even when other participants in a meeting were heated. Yet he was a hesitant public speaker and would avoid media appearances whenever possible.</p> <p>He officially retired in 2007 but maintained an office in his archive at SPRU. Recent work included compiling a chronology of relevant evidence relating to chemical weapons use in Syria. He continued publishing \u2013 most recently a detailed study of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/13/novichok-nerve-agents-russia-salisbury-spy\">novichok</a> series of chemical weapons.</p> <p>He is survived by Mary, whom he married in 2008, and their two sons, Joshua and Oliver; by his son, Charles, from his first marriage, to Nina Hargreaves, which ended in divorce; by five grandchildren; and by Harriett.</p> <p>\u2022 Julian Philip Perry Robinson, chemist and lawyer, born 11 November 1941; died 22 April 2020</p>",
  "<p>It was early on a Monday morning, about 5.30am, and I\u2019d got up to use the toilet. Afterwards, I nipped into the kitchen to get a drink. As I stood at the sink, I could hear snoring from the living room. At first I thought it was the dog. Then I realised it wasn\u2019t. I went into the room to find a stranger asleep on the sofa. He was wearing a grey Adidas tracksuit and, bizarrely, only one shoe. I stood there in my shorts and T-shirt, staring at him.</p> <p>My immediate reaction was fear. I live in a modern block of four flats on a busy road in Kilmarnock, about 20 miles south of Glasgow. The main door to the block is a buzzer-entry, secure entrance. My front door is also locked and the dog, a labradoodle called Molly, normally barks like anything when anyone comes through the door. You\u2019d have to really know what you were doing to break in.</p> <p>My eldest daughter lives with me, and my younger girls, Emily and Eva, stay regularly, and were with me that night. I ran upstairs to check on them. All good \u2013 they were asleep. I was determined to resolve this calmly. I didn\u2019t want the girls waking up to find a disturbance or any unpleasantness.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I own a pub and a nightclub, so I deal with drunk customers routinely, but he was the most confused I\u2019ve seen any human</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I went back downstairs, took a deep breath and composed myself. I decided to wake the stranger. I went over and gave him a wee shake. \u201cHey,\u201d I said. He just grunted at me. I gave him a bigger shake. He roused a bit, but I could tell he was hammered.</p> <p>I bent down and shouted at him. He bolted upright, spluttering and looking a bit wild. He asked me who I was. I asked him how he\u2019d got in, but he just looked confused. He asked me what town he was in. When I told him he was in Kilmarnock, he looked shocked. It turned out he was from Dalkeith, 70 miles away.</p> <p>We swore loudly together and laughed. I asked him for about the fourth time how he\u2019d got into my house. He said he had no idea. Then he looked at his feet. He asked me if I had his other shoe. By this time I was properly laughing and my fear had disappeared.</p> <p>Jason (he\u2019d remembered his name at least) sat up on the sofa and spent a few minutes scratching his head trying hard to work out what was going on. He was still roaring drunk. The smell coming off him was unbelievable. I own a pub and Kilmarnock\u2019s main nightclub, so routinely deal with drunk customers, but he was the most confused I\u2019ve seen any human being.</p> <p>I asked him how he\u2019d got from Dalkeith to Kilmarnock. He told me he\u2019d been out in Glasgow with his mate, Fergie. When he said that name, I stopped dead. My block of flats backs on to another, similar, block \u2013 almost identical to mine \u2013 where an old acquaintance, also called Fergie, lives.</p> <p>I took him into the kitchen and showed him the block. We pieced together that we both knew the same bloke, that they\u2019d been out drinking in Glasgow and must have got the train home together. What happened then was anyone\u2019s guess. We agreed that he\u2019d try to get back to Fergie\u2019s. If he couldn\u2019t (it was still only 6am) he\u2019d come back to mine. He took one of my dog-walking shoes and left the flat.</p> <p>A bit later, I took the dog for a walk. There, on my neighbour\u2019s doorstep, was his lost shoe.</p> <p>The rest of the morning I puzzled over how this could have happened. My neighbours all say the door was shut and no one recalls letting him in. I do know how he got into my flat, though: my oldest daughter, who is 21, had \u201cnipped out\u201d on Sunday evening. Expecting her back, I\u2019d gone upstairs to watch a film with the little ones and then fallen asleep, leaving the door shut \u2013 but unlocked. She\u2019d stayed out.</p> <p>What is weird was the reaction of Molly, our dog. She should have alerted me to the fact that there was a drunkard in my house. But he was obviously a dog-lover and had given her a cuddle. She went back to sleep \u2013 officially the worst guard dog in the world.</p> <p>Jason came back to swap shoes later that day. He got my phone number from our mutual friend and (extremely apologetically) asked if he could come round. He had to ask for my address, which seemed hilarious, given he\u2019d just spent the night on my sofa.</p> <p>\u2022 As told to Camilla Palmer.</p> <p>Do you have an experience to share?

Black scribbled words across a red-painted face, screaming at the viewer to \u201ceat the rich.\u201d. Pollack-like splatters of blue on yellow lips. There\u2019s something dreamlike about them. Some are playful and childlike \u2013 Dr Seuss would approve. But others are sinister and menacing, aggressive and slightly brutal. They look like they hurt to wear, and some of them do.</p> <p>The work of these artists is frequently derided \u2013 for being both too ugly and not ugly enough. \u201cIt\u2019s not about ugliness,\u201d Magyar says. \u201cIt\u2019s about irregularity. Ugly is just a word, which makes you pay attention.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\".\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

Over the past five years, a \u201cselfie face\u201d has emerged: pursed lips, big, wide-open eyes, and feature-enhancing makeup applied just so. \u201cThe fact that there\u2019s such a specific face associated with the selfie tells us that the portrait is less about expressing one\u2019s self and more about expressing compliance with the idea of what a young woman is,\u201d writes Autumn Whitefield-Madrano in her 2017 book, Face Value. \u201cIf there\u2019s self-expression involved in the prototypical selfie, it\u2019s the expression of a wish, not of reality.\u201d</p> <p>Ugly makeup challenges this status quo. \u201cWe\u2019re living in the age of tutorials, when everyone is asking how and never why,\u201d says Magyar. \u201cLots of people are accepting what they see without questioning anything at all. They know how to draw the perfect liner but they have no idea why they\u2019re doing it.\u201d His looks are different. They\u2019re imperfect, sloppy and chaotic. Some remind me of the Fauvist paintings, while others feel cubist and still others are straight-up dada. While the artists sometimes share how they created a look, the focus is less on remaking what you see. Viewers are there to appreciate the vision, not replicate it on their own bodies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\".\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

It subverts the purpose of makeup that has been imposed on the practice by <a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2017/08/evolutionary-psychology-is-the-most-obvious-example-of-how-science-is-flawed.html\">evolutionary biologists</a> and writers. According to this late-20th-century school of thought, popularized by Desmond Morris in The Naked Ape (1967), women wear lipstick to make our lips look more like blood-swollen labia and eye shadow to give our eyes that sleepy, dewy post-orgasm glow. And so for the past half-century, we have been told that makeup is a tool that aids in procreation, even if on a subconscious horny level. \u201cLipstick manufacturers did not create an enhanced mouth,\u201d wrote Morris. \u201cThey created a pair of super labia.\u201d Talk about a cubist nightmare.</p> <p>While sociologists and anthropologists <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/four-fallacies-of-pop-evolutionary-2012-12-07/\">have long questioned the accuracy</a> of Morris\u2019s theories, the idea that makeup is about sex remains prevalent. Women who wear lots of makeup are often stigmatized or dismissed. Women who wear too little are called unprofessional or sloppy. And men who wear makeup? They receive their own set of stereotypes.</p> <p>Ugly makeup flies in the face of all that. While strangeness can be very sexy, the purpose isn\u2019t to be sexy (which, paradoxically, is why it\u2019s can be so sexy, I think). The purpose is to please the wearer. \u201cTo look at something ugly, and realize it unexpectedly pleases you, is a rather precious moment that forces us to reconsider the confines of what we deem necessary for something to be beautiful,\u201d says Julia Lee, a 24-year-old designer who lives in Singapore. Lee also occasionally wears <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B88j0oPoff2/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\">her ugly makeup</a> looks in public, even though \u201cSingapore is rather conservative in terms of aesthetics\u201d, she says. Her <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bq85fwjFABW/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\">blue lips</a>, created with eyeshadow, feel like a \u201cmiddle finger\u201d to social expectations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\".\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

I have also seen more blurry mouths, smudgy lipstick, more under-eye liner, and more drawn-on looks that mimic the facial tattoos popular with the Zoomer set.</p> <p>Although it may seem insulting for me to categorize these trends as ugly, I like to think of it as Magyar does. It\u2019s a compliment \u2013 a word that makes people sit up and pay attention. Ugly exists for ugly\u2019s sake. It\u2019s an underrated aesthetic, one that more people should embrace.</p>",
  "<p>Brian May has complained of \u201crelentless pain\u201d after he was taken to hospital following a gardening injury that tore muscles in his buttocks \u2013 and, while in recovery, made a sustained attack on Boris Johnson\u2019s preparedness for coronavirus.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_3mBS7FJeV/\">Writing on Instagram</a>, the Queen guitarist said: \u201cI managed to rip my gluteus maximus to shreds in a moment of overenthusiastic gardening. So suddenly I find myself in a hospital getting scanned to find out exactly how much I\u2019ve actually damaged myself. Turns out I did a thorough job \u2013 this is a couple of days ago \u2013 and I won\u2019t be able to walk for a while \u2026 or sleep, without a lot of assistance, because the pain is relentless.\u201d</p> <p>He said he would \u201cgo dark for a while\u201d on social media, \u201cgetting some complete rest, at home. Please, please don\u2019t send me sympathy \u2013 I just need some healing silence for a while.\u201d</p> <p>May is <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/brianmayforreal/?hl=en\">an enthusiastic Instagram user</a>, and has documented his lockdown during coronavirus on the platform, including with frequent solo performances.</p> <p>Despite his promise to leave the platform as he recovers, he has posted further content. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_4FS8ulerO/\">In one post he addresses Boris Johnson</a>: \u201cI believe you\u2019re a decent man \u2026 but some terrible mistakes have been made under your watch. This country went into this crisis with a National Health [Service] that had been severely crippled by successive policies of successive governments, your predecessors, underequipped, underfunded, and we sent those doctors and nurses into battle without proper protection, which I think is a scandal that we forever must be ashamed of.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/B_4FS8ulerO/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

  "<p>Maybe you\u2019re the kind of person who buys a new outfit on Saturday afternoon and then wears it the very same evening. That\u2019s not me. Dresses hang unworn in my wardrobe for weeks while they go ever so slightly out of fashion, because I am very comfortable with deferred pleasures. It\u2019s worth waiting for the right occasion to debut a new pair of shoes or to see a movie for the first time.</p> <p>So it\u2019s not that I never wanted to see Federico Fellini\u2019s 8\u00bd. I knew I would get around to it one day, preferably on a large cinema screen, but that date never presented itself. Some people have attempted gently to dissuade me from watching it, but I assumed that they overestimated my sensitivity. Although clearly no Felliniphile, I have no aversion to the director, having admired some of the films he made before this: the seven and a half that fed into its title. This viewing is overdue for another reason: it\u2019s probably the only film in the Sight &amp; Sound Top 10 list to feature an actor from my hometown.</p> <p>Lockdown and a TV screen don\u2019t seem to add up to the right time and platform for any movie lauded as a masterpiece, but what finer hour for a film about inaction and self-absorption? The prospect remains both daunting and a little dutiful, despite all that. A little like Marcello Mastroianni shuffling forward to receive his tumbler of holy water, I wondered whether I was expecting a dose of medicine or a miracle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b08ee986e6b3cefe4d79cb3eaa3c0c4c88eb1649\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b08ee986e6b3cefe4d79cb3eaa3c0c4c88eb1649/0_210_2572_1543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Claudia Cardinale in 8\u00bd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fantasies of a muse ... Claudia Cardinale in 8\u00bd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/Embassy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s an easy film to admire from the off. The opening sequence scorches my brain, with Mastroianni as the Fellini-esque film director Guido suffocating in a locked car in a traffic jam, then floating above a beach, tethered by a rope that suddenly yanks him down to earth. These are hefty metaphors for a lack of control and direction, because this a story of creative block \u2013 Guido is struggling to make his latest movie, a science-fiction epic, and so he retreats into his memories of childhood and fantasies of a muse, played by Claudia Cardinale. It\u2019s the most attractive nervous breakdown I have ever seen.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/15/fellinis-eight-and-a-half-masterpiece-cinemas-dreamer\">Fellini\u2019s 8\u00bd \u2013 a masterpiece by cinema\u2019s ultimate dreamer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Apparently, Fellini was having the same creative trouble himself, though it\u2019s hard to believe. Rather a sly trick on his part to make a film about the difficulties of film-making that\u2019s so breathtakingly gorgeous, that dances so nimbly between timelines, between fantasy and reality, that reflects on and even chastises itself for its own confused ambition. Guido\u2019s world is seductively glamorous, relentlessly so, from the marble halls where he talks shop to his dreamy reminiscences of childhood and the Freudian floor-shows in his psyche. The black-and-white cinematography by Gianni Di Venanzo is stunning, and, of course, there\u2019s the added pleasure of recognising already-familiar images in their proper place in the film. The circus parade finale, for one, or the compellingly cool Mastroianni either peering over his sunglasses or leaning back in a cafe chair, heels on the table, clapping. Each one prompts a little tingle. The sight of the giant scaffolding for the set of Guido\u2019s as-yet-unrealised movie, the skeleton of a spaceship, knocks me out: a reminder of pre-digital processes, but with an extra poignancy as film production is halted across the world.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CjMvGBY_lI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4CjMvGBY_lI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It\u2019s not just the film that worries Guido, though. He is beset by a plague of women, mostly buxom and/or bothersome: his mistress, his wife, his star, etc. When Birkenhead\u2019s own Barbara Steele appears as his friend\u2019s bewitching trophy girlfriend, I cheered. Eventually Guido fantasises about hosting a harem of the women he has known, of how they will bathe him like a baby and he will attack them with a whip. Which is precisely where we find the reason people had warned me away from 8\u00bd. This sexist fantasy creates a shuddering hard-stop in an otherwise fluid and dreamlike movie. It\u2019s not an unexpected development (do any of us go into these classic films entirely blind?) but a deeply unpleasant one. Sgulp!</p> <p>There\u2019s no law that says I have to admire Fellini\u2019s hero, and now may not be the time to pick a fight with a film that was made more than half a century ago, not least one that contains its own critical commentary. Guido is repeatedly reminded that he treats women badly, just as he is told that his film is disjointed, indulgent, incoherent \u2013 although that\u2019s largely, and mostly enjoyably, the point.</p> <p>It\u2019s a dazzling film with all its sheen and puzzling digressions: beautiful and, in its own way, passionate, if offputtingly introspective. I enjoyed it most when it was funny, and there is a lot here that recalls my beloved silent cinema \u2013 wouldn\u2019t you love to see it in a double-bill with <a href=\"https://youtu.be/3T29dVN9GRU\">Sherlock</a><a href=\"https://youtu.be/3T29dVN9GRU\"> Jr</a>? It\u2019s a film I\u2019d happily watch again, and surely find more in each time, even if not as much as others do. Not that it matters. The critical consensus that hurtled it to the top of the canon will continue without my qualms. Sometimes those dresses hang in the wardrobe for so long because, however cleverly they\u2019re cut, they\u2019ll never really suit you.</p>",
  "<p>Turkish officials and the company at the centre of the decision by the NHS to impound hundreds of thousands of protective gowns have claimed they are yet to receive a demand for a refund from the health service at the end of a day of confusion about an ill-fated order of 400,000 of the badly needed items of kit.</p> \n<p>Their statements contradicted assurances made by Downing Street at lunchtime on Thursday that the UK was in negotiations to obtain refunds or replacements \u2013 and it gradually emerged that a majority of the gowns were still in process of being tested after some had failed UK safety standards.</p> \n<p>An early evening clarification from the Department of Health made clear that 2,400 gowns from an initial batch of 67,000 that had arrived in the UK last month had failed safety tests \u2013 forcing officials to impound the majority of the rest so they could be properly tested.</p> \n<p>Only 4,500 gowns were passed as fit for use in the health service \u2013 around 1% of the original order \u2013 while another 170,000 gowns were being held in Turkey so they could be tested there. The rest are yet to be delivered.</p> \n<p>A government spokesman said: \u201cWhile a small number of these gowns have failed tests in the UK, more have passed tests making them suitable for use in the NHS. The majority of items ordered from the private supplier are awaiting testing in the UK and Turkish warehouses.\u201d</p> \n<p>The late clarification came after nearly a day of uncorrected reports that all 400,000 gowns ordered were unfit for use, including statements made by a cabinet minister. It followed growing pressure from Turkey, which complained that ministers were allowing the wrong picture to be presented.</p> \n<p>A Turkish diplomatic source told the Guardian that the country had been trying to establish what the problem was throughout Thursday and argued that concerns over the order had been overstated. \u201cSo far nobody approached us or claimed for anything from any company in Turkey,\u201d the source added.</p> \n<p>Three weeks ago, the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, promised that the gowns would arrive as part of an 84-tonne shipment at a time when NHS staff were warning there was only a few days-worth of protective equipment left.</p> \n<p>But almost all the goods trumpeted by Jenrick have yet to be used in the NHS \u2013 the latest in a string of hasty NHS procurement decisions during the coronavirus crisis that also saw ministers buy 3.5m antibody tests that turned out not to work and 250 Chinese-supplied ventilators that were deemed to be dangerous.</p> \n<p>In the wake of the Turkish situation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/19/hospital-leaders-hit-out-government-ppe-shortage-row-escalates-nhs\">NHS bodies representing </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/19/hospital-leaders-hit-out-government-ppe-shortage-row-escalates-nhs\">hospital trusts warned ministers against over-promising</a>, said that it had a corrosive impact across the health service.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said: \u201cThis illustrates the danger of making promises on a wing and a prayer. We have warned repeatedly that setting big targets which are then not met and saying all will be well, when at the sharp end of care it is manifestly not, undermines confidence among clinical staff on the frontline.\u201d</p> \n<p>A deposit was paid by the NHS, and although the delivery was subject to days of delay, the shipment of 67,000 gowns eventually arrived in the UK over a fortnight ago after the consignment had been subject to a cursory check by British officials in Istanbul.</p> \n<p>\u201cSome of the boxes were opened and people on the ground took pictures of the gowns to check with the UK. After that they were flown to Britain where the plan was to use them in the NHS,\u201d a Whitehall source added.</p> \n<p>But on Thursday ministers said publicly that the gowns were useless for medical purposes after it emerged they had been impounded at Heathrow airport after the stock failed to meet required standards.</p> \n<p>Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, said: \u201cThere was a view that it was good enough PPE. It is only when it has got here that teams have looked at it again and taken a view that it is not up to the right standard and they\u2019ve decided not to use it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Downing Street officials said subsequently that the NHS was now in negotiations to get new gowns sent, or it would ask for a refund from the supplier, a private Turkish manufacturer called Selegna, a company founded a few months ago initially to supply the fashion sector before switching to medical supplies as the coronavirus crisis broke out.</p> \n<p>Selegna said it had had no contact with the NHS on Thursday \u2013 and insisted that no problems with the shipment had been mentioned earlier in the week when the company said it was in touch with NHS officials.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe fabric of the aprons is certified. All products are certified. If there was a problem, they could do research and let us know,\u201d Mehmet D\u00fczen for Selegna told the BBC.

Welfare claimants are entitled to payments equivalent to housing benefit.

This is the legal equivalent of putting food in a freezer. The cases are still there, ready to be thawed out at any moment.</p> <p>Where a tenant is behind with their rent, landlords can issue them with a notice instructing them to leave, but (for the moment) the tenant can ignore it. On 25 June the <a href=\"https://www.housing.org.uk/news-and-blogs/news/the-coronavirus-act--details-on-evictions/\">housing courts will </a><a href=\"https://www.housing.org.uk/news-and-blogs/news/the-coronavirus-act--details-on-evictions/\">reopen</a> for business. Judges will have to determine thousands of stayed pre-coronavirus cases, and the even greater number of new claims for possession arising from the lockdown.</p> <p>Ministers have grasped that hundreds of thousands of homes are at risk. Earlier this week the housing minister, Robert Jenrick, announced that the government was working closely with judges to draft a <a href=\"https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/government-to-give-renters-added-protection-after-covid-19-eviction-ban-is-lifted-jenrick-tells-mps-66319\">\u201cpre-action protocol\u201d</a> for when the stay is lifted.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.landlordnews.co.uk/will-the-ban-on-evictions-be-extended/\">He told MPs</a> that the protocol will \u201cenable tenants to have an added degree of protection, because instead of embarking upon the eviction proceedings immediately, there will be a duty upon their landlords to reach out to them, discuss their situation, and try to find an affordable repayment plan\u201d.</p> <p>The problem with the protocol is that it is toothless \u2013 essentially depending on the benevolence of landlords.</p> <p>The two most common ways landlords seek possession are under \u201csection 21\u201d and \u201cground 8\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/evicting-tenants/section-21-and-section-8-notices\">Section 21</a> provides that where a landlord has complied with certain procedural requirements (like issuing a notice using the correct form and waiting for a prescribed time before applying to court) the court <em>must</em> order possession.</p> <p>The statute does not require a landlord to have complied with the government\u2019s proposed pre-action protocol. For that reason, even where landlords have rushed to issue proceedings, and have ignored requests from tenants to defer payments for a short time, judges will be required to approve evictions.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/housing/renting-privately/during-your-tenancy/check-your-section-8-notice/\">Ground 8 provides</a> that where a tenant is in rent arrears (eight weeks if the rent is due weekly), both when the landlord serves a notice on them and when the hearing takes place, the court must order possession.</p> <p>Again, the court takes no account of the landlord\u2019s conduct; it focuses simply on the amount of the tenant\u2019s arrears. In these circumstances, if the new protocol is as the minister describes it, it will not protect tenants at all.</p> <p>There are alternatives. In last year\u2019s general election, the Conservatives <a href=\"https://www.landlordtoday.co.uk/breaking-news/2019/11/tories-confirm-plan-to-scrap-section-21-and-introduce-lifetime-deposit\">committed to abolish</a> section 21 as part of their <a href=\"https://www.conservatives.com/news/more-homes-more-homeowners-and-a-better-deal-for-renters-under-the-conservatives\">\u201cbetter deal for renters\u201d</a>. The government reaffirmed that commitment in the Queen\u2019s speech, announcing a renters\u2019 reform bill to include the abolition of section 21. They should be held to that promise. As for ground 8, it too needs to be abolished. Or, if that is impossible, rescinded for such time until tenants have had a chance to reduce their debts once they\u2019re able to go back to work.</p> <p>Abolishing or rescinding ground 8 would not prevent landlords relying on other grounds of possession. But, without it in place, judges will be free to order possession only if reasonable \u2013 thereby giving effect to the tenant defences the government says that it wants in place. One further advantage of abolishing ground 8 is that courts can turn to other possession proceedings in which possession orders are made but suspended, while tenants are given the chance to repay arrears to a realistic plan. </p> <p>Muddling on without the abolition of section 21 and ground 8 will lead to millions of people forced out of their homes. It will send those evicted scattering \u2013 some to stay with elderly relatives, some into local authority housing (although it is at breaking point) and many into homelessness.</p> <p>The government accepts that street homelessness speeds the transmission of coronavirus: this is the grim calculation that underpins the government\u2019s granting of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/councils-told-to-house-all-rough-sleepers-in-england-by-weekend\">resources to councils</a> to house rough sleepers. Drifting into a future where huge numbers of people lose their homes needlessly would be just as dangerous \u2013 for those who are evicted, and for everyone else.</p> <p>\u2022 David Renton is a housing barrister at Garden Court Chambers</p>",

  "<p>In the garden on a bright morning, with sunshine lancing the cherry blossom, my eye is drawn to the fat glitter of a queen bumblebee gathering nectar in the golden bowl of a tree peony flower. A black, almost velvety, body and rich orange-tipped rump indicate that this is a red-tailed bumblebee (<em>Bombus lapidarius</em>). Her wings shine as if newly waxed, while her tongue briskly probes a tassel of stamens. After a few seconds she\u2019s off to check the next bloom \u2013 then airborne again, zooming over the wall.</p> <p>Lockdown has replaced the background hum of distant traffic with the low, blundering drone of bumblebees. It began in March when buff-tailed queens emerged from hibernation, zigzagging across the lawn. Buff-tails are easily recognised by their size \u2013 the queens can be more than 2cm long \u2013 and their markings, two well-separated yellow bands and a brown-tinged tail-tip. Because they nest in holes in the ground, they are also called earth bumblebees (<em>Bombus terrestris</em>). The name is like an anchor, tethering a creature of sunlight, pollen and warmth to the chthonic darkness underground.</p> <p>In city gardens in the warmest parts of Britain, buff-tails can be active all winter. But in this rural frost pocket, those early days after hibernation are perilous. One cold morning I found a queen crashed in the vegetable patch, chilled and stiff. She barely had the energy to raise a leg in warning. I carefully picked her up \u2013 she weighed nothing and it was like holding an empty, slightly prickly seed husk. I put her on a clean tea towel and dabbed a small droplet of sugar syrup nearby. Her antennae waved, her mouthparts gaped and she flipped forward a slim proboscis from under her head. Its outer sheath opened slightly and a long, gingery tongue appeared, which she plunged into the syrup.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e064d7c4abde7fceeb6e47976130e7b3c0974c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e064d7c4abde7fceeb6e47976130e7b3c0974c5/0_43_2126_1275/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A buff-tail bumblebee queen on the writer's hand\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It was like holding an empty, slightly prickly seed husk.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sara Hudston</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bumblebee tongues have hairy ends, good for soaking up nectar. Buff-tails\u2019 tongues measure 5.8mm on average, which is relatively shorter, so they prefer shallow, flat flowers. Garden bumblebees (<em>B</em> <em>hortorum</em>) have tongues twice as long, enabling them to reach into the depths of narrow, tubular blossoms, such as lavender.</p> <p>As my cold queen sucked the sugar she began to vibrate like a helicopter powering up. When she finished, I took her outside and she flew away.</p>",

The congresswoman is also seeking all documents and communications between the Trump Organization and any US federal employees and officials that relate to the novel coronavirus.</p> <p>Bloomberg News reported in April that the Trump Organization was seeking the bailout money to help pay for bartenders, bagpipers, and other employees who have been furloughed.

  "<p>In making his landmark post-Brexit speech in February under Sir James Thornhill\u2019s baroque painted ceiling in the Royal Hospital, Greenwich, Boris Johnson believed he had found the perfect setting to paint his own picture of Britain charting a new course as a free-trading, independent, open and liberal nation.</p> <p>Like the painting above him, eulogising the triumph of William and Mary over the popish and tyrannical French, Johnson\u2019s speech was an optimistic and patriotic piece of work. It offered a distinctive vision of British prosperity and diplomatic superiority.</p> <p>The speech had no hint that the world he described, and Britain\u2019s place in it, was under any existential threat. But the past three months have left UK foreign policy thinkers suddenly searching in the fog for Britain\u2019s future role in this changed world.</p> <p>Indeed, as the UK prepares to celebrate VE Day, the institutional order created by the west following the defeat of Germany, and on which Johnson\u2019s vision rested, seems after 75 years finally to be coming apart. Those institutions, in which the UK thrived, are either paralysed, or a battleground.</p> <p>Covid-19, an invisible enemy, but deadlier than the blitz, has exacerbated and accelerated trends recalibrating risk, revealing new Great Powers and placing all UK diplomatic alliances under scrutiny. Sir Simon McDonald, the foreign office senior mandarin, says it is a \u201cwatershed moment for humanity\u201d, and a chance for \u201ca world reset\u201d.</p> <p>Ministers have postponed the foreign and security policy review, due to have been published this autumn, to devote time to fighting the virus. Yet the UK\u2019s most senior diplomats, including at foreign office executive committee level, are already examining Britain\u2019s strategic posture.</p> <p>The question of the UK\u2019s greatest ally, the US, currently, in the words of the former foreign secretary David Miliband, \u201ca flagship for dysfunction\u201d can be set aside until the US elections.</p> <p>For most British analysts, the most pressing foreign policy question for the UK will be its relations with China. Will the divisions between the US and China deepen so much that, regardless of the outcome of the US election, all nations, including the UK, are sucked into its vortex, requiring Britain to choose? If so, multilateral solutions become harder.</p> <p>Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has spoken of the need for \u201ca deep dive\u201d into the role of China, adding vaguely: \u201cWe cannot have business as usual.\u201d The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has backed an inquiry.</p> <p>The mood towards Beijing on the Tory benches, already sceptical, is turning ugly and suggests at minimum that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/29/johnson-faces-tory-rebellion-over-huawei-5g-plans-for-britain\">the Huawei deal</a> will not survive in its current form, placing other Chinese infrastructure projects in the UK at question.</p> <p>\u201cWe are all paying the price for Beijing\u2019s decision to ignore the science, prioritise trade \u2013 and put the rest of the world\u2019s health at risk,\u201d says Tom Tugendhat, the liberal internationalist chair of the foreign affairs select committee. His committee is relentlessly pressing the foreign office for clear strategy on China. It\u2019s clear that his committee will at minimum demand the UK adopt takeover rules that sees Chinese investment as a security risk.</p> <p>Nick Timothy, Theresa May\u2019s former special adviser and a long-term China sceptic, has lambasted \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2015/oct/27/where-does-britain-draw-the-line-with-saudi-arabia-and-china\">David Cameron\u2019s Operation Kowtow</a>\u201d and identified the chief culprit as George Osborne and the Treasury. He says: \u201cJust as Harold Macmillan had perceived that, as British power declined, we should play Athens to America\u2019s Rome, Mr Osborne thought he could pull off a geopolitical pivot that would strengthen Britain for decades to come.\u201d</p> <p>Echoing the US State Department, Timothy adds: \u201cIt is surely now obvious that China is also a strategic rival to the west as a whole. It is an autocratic and oppressive state, with wildly different values and interests to our own. Its policy towards Asia, Africa and elsewhere is inevitably imperialistic. And its modus operandi \u2013 setting debt traps for countries to gain leverage over them and engaging in mass industrial espionage \u2013 is a danger to our interests and those of our allies.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09077ac6cc0d9df384c3f896ca2985860032d0f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09077ac6cc0d9df384c3f896ca2985860032d0f6/0_141_3300_1980/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Soldiers help to carry out Covid-19 testing in Plymouth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soldiers help to carry out Covid-19 testing in Plymouth.

The Foreign Office is urging caution, making the case for keeping a few bridges unburnt. The former foreign secretary Lord Hague told Policy Exchange: \u201cWe can\u2019t solve global problems without China. And global problems are some of our most pressing and obviously most existential. The Covid-19 crisis is an example of such a dramatic world crisis. So we can\u2019t be dependent on China, but we can\u2019t be without a framework of cooperation with China.\u201d</p> <p>McDonald agrees: \u201cThere is no problem that the world faces today that can be addressed, still less solved, without the active participation of China.\u201d</p> <p>Miliband also argues that a balance needs striking. He says he has no illusions about China. \u201cIt is obvious that the Chinese state is being very confident in its response to Covid-19, describing it both as a success and the product of its one-party system. Their message is being effectively delivered \u2013 through aid supplies and diplomatic outreach around the world. It is much harsher than before, with crackdowns at home and favour-buying abroad.\u201d</p> <p>But that does not mean cooperation with China should be seen as appeasement, Miliband argues. \u201cWe need to worry about a democratic recession, and the debate about whether democracies or autocracies coped best in this crisis is materially relevant to lives around the world, but it is really important this debate does end up excluding the need for institutions that encompass both democratic and autocratic regimes.\u201d<br> China is not just a seminar discussion for the UK. Britain needs China on board if its chairmanship of the UN climate change conference, set for Glasgow in November but now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/uk-likely-to-postpone-cop26-un-climate-talks-glasgow-coronavirus\">delayed until the middle of next year</a>, is to be a success.</p> <p>Even now the best UK diplomats are pressing China to adopt bolder carbon emission targets for 2030. McDonald has said he hopes the coronavirus crisis will lead to greater Chinese ambition. \u201cBuild back better\u201d has long been part of UK disaster relief thinking, and has now become the slogan of those preparing green post-coronavirus stimulation packages.</p> <p>But there are countervailing forces. Many of the building blocks for Glasgow have been removed. An EU-China meet-up scheduled for September and seen as a moment for China to float new targets has been cancelled. A Chinese-hosted conference on biodiversity, a chance to discuss carbon sinks and nature based solutions, has <a href=\"http://sdg.iisd.org/events/2020-un-biodiversity-conference/\">also been postponed</a>, while governments are under pressure to save industries such as aviation.</p> <p>Above all, even under a Democrat presidency, relations between China and the US will be on a downward curve, making a climate change agreement more difficult. Tim Benton, head of the Chatham House energy and environment programme, foresees an uphill task for Britain\u2019s diplomats. He argues that: \u201cAny tension that undermines the existing international architecture \u2013 whether it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/wto\">WTO</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">WHO</a>, UNFCCC [the UN framework convention on climate change] \u2013 anything that creates stress is going to get in the way of reaching climate change targets.</p> <p>\u201cYou can imagine there is so much to-ing and fro-ing between major powers vying for their own nationalistic interest that climate change just gets pushed further down the agenda because economic reconstruction is seen as so much more important.\u201d</p> <p>Economic reconstruction leads to the Brexit question. For many diplomats, the thought of piling a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/04/no-more-deal-or-no-deal-no-10s-brexit-diktat-to-foreign-office\">no-deal Brexit</a> on to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-jobs-bailout-treasury-resolution-foundation-wage-subsidy-scheme\">\u00a3300bn coronavirus hit</a> to the UK economy looks less like an act of self-harm, and more like a death wish. McDonald, speaking to the foreign affairs select committee, held out the faint hope that it was still an open question whether the PM might yet revisit the timetable.</p> <p>Robin Niblett, Chatham House director, senses Johnson will not delay, but instead look for a short-form agreement. \u201cIf you think that by the summer, the politics may get nastier with inquests about how we got into quite such a mess, and the money for what was called levelling up has been diverted to survival \u2013 the survival of businesses and the economy \u2013 then Johnson may feel politically he has to follow through on Brexit. Once you delay, you lose your agency and Brexit is about agency, as much as it is about control.\u201d</p> <p>Miliband predicts the UK and the EU might settle for an outline deal that leaves details to be negotiated.</p> <p>Either way, the integrated review will have to work with changed assumptions about both resources and security. \u201cThe budget for global Britain promises to be brutal,\u201d Niblett says.</p> <p>In the UK, growth is due to fall 7% this year. The World Trade Organization sees world trade declining by between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-putting-world-on-track-for-new-great-depression-says-who\">13% and 34%.</a> Covid\u2019s lasting legacy may be a switch away from just-in-time imports towards shorter supply chains and national sourcing.</p> <p>In this deglobalising world, Johnson\u2019s promise in Greenwich to be \u201ca superhero champion\u201d of free trade looks incongruous. The US \u2013 with which the UK seeks to sign a signature free-trade deal \u2013 is in free fall.</p> <p>Yet Johnson fervently believes that the coronavirus only strengthens the case for a free-trade deal. Any scrap of extra growth becomes important.</p> <p>At the same time, definitions of security are in flux. In the view of Professor Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director of the defence thinktank the Royal United Services Institute, the virus ranks alongside the cold war or 9/11 in terms of its security implications. The original concept of the walled state as protector has been reasserted, but the case for traditional defence spending has weakened.</p> <p>The army has had its role in the UK crisis, but the aircraft carrier has proved irrelevant, acting as much as an incubator as a shield from the virus. If the new stealth bomber is a pathogen, vaccines are the new missile defence system.</p> <p>In a post-coronavirus comprehensive spending review it will be health and not defence that will be first in the queue for the distribution of dwindling resources, Chalmers suggests.</p> <p>Beatrice Heuser, professor of international relations at Glasgow University, predicts defence officials \u201cwill have to cook their books like hell to reach the Nato target of spending at 2% of GDP\u201d.</p> <p>There is a final issue for Britain: relevance. Many analysts also fear that the UK\u2019s credibility as a leading convening power on the whole nexus of issues of the climate crisis, global health and development has taken a hit by its performance over coronavirus.</p> <p>Bill Gates may right to say that no country is likely to get an A grade for its pandemic preparedness, but judging by the European press the UK is currently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/complacent-uk-draws-global-criticism-for-covid-19-response-boris-johnson\">near the bottom of the class</a>, labelled, rightly or wrongly, as leading on \u201cherd immunity\u201d and then abandoning the policy.</p> <p>Niblett argues that \u201cBrexit was such a shock to people that thought Britain was pragmatic and had a sense of its national interest. Now the almost wilful lack of preparation over coronavirus makes it feel like Britain just assumed it was separate, an island off the coast of Europe, and it has discovered it is not.

Even though our scientific and university calling card remains unparalleled, the NHS was held up to a mirror and it has been shown at best to be underfunded.

As far back as 2008, the UK government published a cross-government white paper entitled \u201chealth is global\u201d. The paper argued that health should be seen as \u201can agent for good in foreign policy\u201d so the UK was in at the birth of health diplomacy.</p> <p>The UK may have been trounced in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/23/who-elects-first-ever-african-director-general-after-tense-vote-tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus\">election to head the WHO in 2017</a>, but there are influential Brits all around the international health set-up. UK\u2019s strong medical research base, large aid budget and an interventionist mindset gives Johnson the platform from which to engage. The natural instinct within Whitehall is to be a player, but it will require leadership that only a prime minister can provide.</p> <p>Greenwich, according to Nicholas Hawksmoor, writing in 1728, was chosen as the site of Royal Hospital because it was located on the bend in the river \u201cin the View of all the World and in the Sight of the Grand Emporium London\u201d.</p> <p>The nation\u2019s wealth and global outlook were seen as interdependent.

But that day, a series of events unfolded that ended in his killing at the hands of Gregory McMichael, 64, and his 34-year-old son, Travis McMichael.</p> \n<p>Lawyers for Arbery\u2019s family have said his death was a \u201clynching\u201d and requested it be investigated as a hate crime.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"62185716-6f28-4a84-8ea9-6f173335bf93\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/06NoeB93En0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In one call, made at 1.14pm, the dispatcher asks for the address and the reason for the call. An unidentified man\u2019s voice can be heard responding, \u201cUh, I\u2019m out here at Satilla Shores. There\u2019s a black male running down the street,\u201d in an apparent reference Arbery.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c7b8757e-9cfa-4b76-abf6-2025f7636ea1\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uFgy5ZT-1PA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In an earlier call at 1.08pm, a different unidentified caller reports \u201ca guy in a house right now, a house under construction\u201d. The dispatcher asks if the man is breaking into the property, to which the caller responds: \u201cNo, it\u2019s all open, it\u2019s under construction.\u201d</p> \n<p>The caller then says, \u201cHe\u2019s running right now, and there he goes right now,\u201d referring to Arbery, who was taking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/06/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-georgia\">his usual jog around the neighborhood</a>. The dispatcher asks: \u201cOK, what is he doing?\u201d The caller replies: \u201cHe\u2019s running down the street.\u201d</p> \n<p>A few second later, the dispatcher says: \u201cI just need to know what he was doing wrong. Was he just on the premises and not supposed to be?\u201d</p> \n<p>The beginning of his response is garbled, but when the background noise clears, there is no clear answer to the question. The dispatcher ends the calls shortly after, and says she will send someone by to check.</p> \n<p>At 1.14 pm, the second call is answered at the call center. Following the first exchange between the caller and the dispatcher, the caller again did not respond to the dispatcher, instead yelling: \u201cStop. Stop that. Dammit. Stop.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/ahmaud-arbery-video-shooting-sharing-viral\">Ahmaud Arbery killing reignites debate over sharing graphic viral videos</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A moment later he shouts \u201cTravis!\u201d apparently addressing Travis McMichael.</p> \n<p>The dispatcher attempts to redirect the man\u2019s attention 27 seconds into the call, saying, \u201cSir, hello, sir,\u201d but does not receive an answer. The 911 call continues to record for nearly five minutes.</p> \n<p>Authorities have not released the identities of the callers. No one has been charged in the case.</p> \n<p>Two prosecutors have recused themselves, citing professional connections to Gregory McMichael. Documents and state records show the elder McMichael is a <a href=\"https://law.georgia.gov/press-releases/2009-02-25/execution-date-set-man-convicted-glynn-county-murder\">former police detective</a> and <a href=\"https://thebrunswicknews.com/news/local_news/judge-signs-order-of-execution/article_5197ce3d-f667-5533-af39-665c715b6b98.html\">district attorney investigator</a> in Glynn county.</p> \n<p>The Guardian has contacted Gregory and Travis McMichael for comment.</p> \n<p>An outside prosecutor in charge of the case said he wants a grand jury to decide whether criminal charges are warranted. But that will not happen until at least mid-June, since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/state-of-georgia\">Georgia</a> courts remain largely closed because of the coronavirus.</p> \n<p>According to a police report from that day, the two men grabbed their weapons, a .357 Magnum revolver and a shotgun, jumped into a truck and began following Arbery after seeing him running.</p> \n<p>Gregory McMichael told police he and his adult son thought Arbery matched the description of someone caught on a security camera committing a recent break-in in the neighborhood. Arbery was not considered a suspect in any burglary.</p> \n<p>Gregory McMichael told police Arbery violently attacked his son. The video footage filmed by an anonymous individual and released this week contradicts that claim.</p> \n<p>Georgia law says a person can kill in self-defense \u201conly if he or she reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent death or great bodily injury \u2026 or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.\u201d The law also says a person who provokes an attack or acts as \u201cthe aggressor\u201d can\u2019t claim self-defense.</p> \n<p>Arbery\u2019s family has called for immediate arrests after the video was released this week.</p> \n<p>\u201cI saw my son come into the world,\u201d Arbery\u2019s mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, said. \u201cAnd seeing him leave the world, it\u2019s not something that I\u2019ll want to see ever.\u201d</p> \n<p>The civil rights attorney <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/15/black-americans-genocide-open-season\">Ben Crump</a>, who is representing Arbery\u2019s father, said the video calls into question the claims made by the McMichaels in the police report.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey are heartbroken,\u201d Crump said of the family. Of Arbery\u2019s father, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s just heart-wrenching for him that he has to look at his other son and daughter and try to make sense of it. He really thinks that his son was lynched.\u201d</p> \n<p>Crump said Arbery\u2019s parents, who are separated, want the public to see the video, even they cannot bring themselves to watch it themselves.</p> \n<p>Lee Merritt, an attorney for Arbery\u2019s mother, said the justice department should investigate the death as a hate crime.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe FBI has said it\u2019s assisting,\u201d said Department of Justice spokesman Matt Lloyd, \u201cand as is standard protocol we look forward to working with them should information come to light of a potential federal violation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Republican governor Brian Kemp late Tuesday threw his support behind that inquiry. He tweeted: \u201cGeorgians deserve answers. State law enforcement stands ready to ensure justice is served.\u201d He added on Thursday that the killing was \u201cabsolutely horrific\u201d.</p> \n<p>Also on Thursday afternoon, Donald Trump said: \u201cI\u2019m getting a full report on it this evening. My heart goes out to the parents and to the loved ones of the young gentleman. It\u2019s a very sad thing.\u201d</p> \n<p>The chairman of the House judiciary committee, Jerry Nadler, cited \u201cclear probable cause for first-degree murder charges\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1258532131224993792\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Nadler: \"The cell phone footage of the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery would appear to present clear probable cause for first degree murder charges.

It enjoyed 120 consecutive months of job growth and the lowest unemployment rate it saw in many years. It was making measurable progress in paying down pension obligations. </p> <p>Three months later, said Newsom, the state is facing a shortfall of tens of billions. </p> <p>Almost $12 billion in unemployment has been released just since March 15. Those job losses will soon trickle down to local governments, making messes out of next year\u2019s budgets and forcing tough decisions. </p> <p>Every budget around the globe will in some way be impacted by the pandemic, but the losses have outsized impact in a state whose economy is the fifth largest in the world. </p> <p>\u201cThis moment is directly related to COVID-19, not mismanagement. But because of this pandemic, these revenue shortfalls are bigger than even the state of California,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this. This will be challenging ... But my optimism is conditioned on this: more federal support,\u201d he added. </p> <p>Moving forward will require a historic level of partnership between states and federal governments, he said. While the CARES Act has been profoundly beneficial, the enormity of the moment demands even more support. </p> <p>\u201cThis is bigger than all of us and we really need the fed government to do more and help us through this moment. We punch above our weight in this state. We\u2019ll come back stronger than ever.

We\u2019re interested in argument and will try to provide some flexibility. But it\u2019s a health-first frame,\u201d Newsom said. </p> <p>Among the conditions: health officials must attest that they\u2019ve had no more than one case per 10,000 people in the last 14 days, no deaths in the past two weeks, and that they could handle a surge in hospitalizations from coronavirus. </p> <p>They must also be able to conduct 1.5 tests for every 1,000 residents, have 15 contact tracers, or \u201cdisease detectives\u201d per 1,000 residents, can support homeless residents, and skilled nursing facilities must have a two week supply of personal protective equipment on hand. </p> <p>\u201cIf they can\u2019t meet the guidelines, we aren\u2019t able to accommodate that and will enforce in a thoughtful and judicious way.
