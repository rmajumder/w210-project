Southern states such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/state-of-georgi\">Georgia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas\">Texas</a> were among the first to allow shops and businesses to reopen.</p> \n   <p>\u201cVaccine or no vaccine, we\u2019re back,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/15/trump-coronavirus-warp-speed-vaccine-white-house\">Trump said in the White House rose garden</a> on Friday while announcing a major <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/the-race-for-a-vaccine-how-trumps-america-first-approach-slows-the-global-search\">US drive to create a coronavirus vaccine</a>.</p> \n   <p>Polls show Biden beating Trump in battleground states but <a href=\"https://watson.brown.edu/people/faculty-fellows/schiller\">Wendy Schiller,</a> a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, warns that he still faces political traps.</p> \n   <p>\u201cThe fundamental problem for the Democratic party is that in order to defeat Trump, they almost have to cheerlead for a bad economy and they also have to cheerlead for new [coronavirus] hotspots in swing states. It sounds gruesome, but really that\u2019s so far what they\u2019re banking on to beat Trump.</p> \n   <p>\u201cAnd in this case, Trump is absolutely smarter than that and what he is offering, not only his base but voters in swing states, is hope. It\u2019d actually be reminiscent, in a much less articulate way, of Ronald Reagan.

  "<p>A few years ago, a pretty young woman approached me in the lunchroom of the building where I began work on my novel, The Weekend.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re writing about ageing, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she asked. I was, I said, smiling.</p> <p>She considered my 50 year-old face for a few long seconds before shuddering, \u201cI\u2019m terrified of ageing.\u201d</p> <p>I burst out laughing.</p> <p>But she\u2019s not alone. Looking down the tunnel to old age, it seems we\u2019re all afraid. But of what, exactly? How should we think about growing old?</p> <p>***</p> <p>At a dinner I sat next to a darkly witty gerontologist. He was under no illusions about very old age \u2013 at one point in our conversation there came some pragmatic deliberation about the best way to kill yourself when the time came. But he was also keen to stamp on a few old-people cliches.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2019/oct/23/what-is-it-about-ageing-that-is-so-confronting\">What is it about ageing that is so confronting? \u2013 Full Story podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He told me of an elderly man brought to an appointment by his children. They were deeply concerned, wanting him assessed for dementia. His major symptom was falling in love with a sex worker, moving her into his house, giving her money and property. The doctor reluctantly put him through rounds of rigorous tests \u2013 and found absolutely nothing wrong with his cognition or psychology. He was sane, he was loved, he was happy. The doctor hooted with delight as he told me this story.</p> <p>Later, he asked me: \u201cHow many years of your life would you trade for a Booker Prize?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?! None!\u201d I replied. I was surprised at the vehemence and speed of my answer, and that I knew it to be absolutely true.</p> <p>Then he asked, \u201cWhat if they were the years between 85 and 95?\u201d</p> <p>Hmmm.</p> <p>***</p> <p>My friend J reports on her mother, very slowly dying in a nursing home. She\u2019s in her late 90s, and so frail her heart has not the strength to push blood to the extremities of her body. Her hands and feet are bloodless, cold. Yet when she\u2019s wheeled into a patch of sunshine in the garden, she smiles with deep, sensual pleasure. \u201cHow lovely this is,\u201d she says, with relish. Soaking up the warmth, the sound of the trees moving above her.</p> <p>J\u2019s sister leaves a nursing home visit one day in bleak distress. \u201cI can\u2019t go in there any more,\u201d she says.</p> <p>J agrees that it\u2019s very hard, but is curious: What especially prompted this today?</p> <p>Her sister\u2019s expression is almost angry. \u201cIt\u2019s that she just \u2013 lies there. She\u2019s so \u2026useless.\u201d</p> <p>Another friend\u2019s mother, also in her 90s, was taken to inspect a potential nursing home. Through a doorway she saw some residents in an exercise class.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with them?\u201d she barked loudly.</p> <p>\u201cNothing,\u201d her daughter said. \u201cThey\u2019re just \u2026 old.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d said the mother viciously, \u201cthey look <em>retarded</em>.\u201d</p> <p>A different woman, unwell at 79, needed aqua therapy at a rehab centre but refused to enter the pool. \u201cI\u2019m not getting in that water. It\u2019s full of <em>disgusting old bodies</em>.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone in the pool was visibly younger than she.</p> <p>A man in late middle age invited his 86 year-old father to live with him and his family. It hasn\u2019t worked out well. The son describes the sound of his father\u2019s walker creaking down the hall. \u201cI hate him,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Is this dread of the mirror so deeply rooted in all of us? Is it a biological imperative, to turn away as soon as we catch its reflection?</p> <p>***</p> <p>In 2015, a review in an Australian newspaper rebuked Edna O\u2019Brien for her wild, chaotic and (I thought) stupendously adventurous novel, The Little Red Chairs. The reviewer\u2019s main point was not so much that the book was flawed, though it surely is, but more importantly that the cause of these flaws was the author\u2019s advanced age. What I read, between the faux-respectful lines, was an unprinted command to O\u2019Brien: You\u2019re old. You\u2019re embarrassing yourself. Shut up.</p> <p>O\u2019Brien was 85 at the time. Now she\u2019s 89 and her new novel, Girl, about the Nigerian girls abducted by Boko Haram, was published in September 2019.</p> <p>Not shutting up, then.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Our predictions for old age foresee an epoch of physical incapacity and psychic misery, in contrast with our vital, flourishing youth. But last night on my couch I spent five minutes scribbling down a list of the troubles that plagued me and those in my social circle \u2013 middle class, well educated, well resourced \u2013 before we turned 50.</p> <p>The list: Major depression. Anorexia and bulimia. A birth malformation necessitating 15 years of agonisingly painful surgery and follow-up. Panic attacks and agoraphobia. Kidney disease. Broken arms and legs. Chronic, intensifying lung disease. Bipolar disorder leading to job and relationship loss, financial disaster. Endometriosis. Crohn\u2019s disease and irritable bowel syndrome with frequent hospitalisation. Asthma, fatal. Asthma, chronic, multiple hospitalisations. Excruciating diverticulitis. Migraines and an inability to hold a job. Severe postnatal depression. HIV/AIDs, mostly fatal. Type 1 diabetes and complications. Juvenile arthritis with attendant chronic immobilising pain. Major paranoid psychosis, forced hospitalisation and trauma. Cardiac problems, multiple open-heart surgeries. Schizophrenia causing lifelong inability to work and extreme social isolation. Melanoma. Bowel cancer, fatal. Breast cancer, fatal and non-fatal. Brain cancer, fatal and non-fatal. Stevens-Johnson syndrome caused by medical malpractice. Stomach cancer, fatal. Strokes, locked-in syndrome, fatal. Severe addiction to illegal drugs, alcohol, prescription painkillers. Chronic and acute immobilising pain in spine, knee, neck, foot. Knee and shoulder surgery, severely limiting mobility. High blood pressure. Car accidents, frequently fatal. Farm accidents. Multiple sclerosis. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Suicide attempts. Suicide.</p> <p>After five minutes I stopped scribbling. Excluding a couple of the cancers, almost all of these issues had first occurred before age 30; many have persisted into the fifth and sixth decades. Yet some cognitive dissonance allows us to perceive even long-term disorders in youth as somehow aberrant, manageable and far less horrifying than the potential \u201cdegradations\u201d of old age.</p> <p>I recently saw a birthday card carrying the image of a haughtily elegant middle-aged woman in 1950s attire. The caption read, \u201cHoney, you couldn\u2019t pay me to be 20.\u201d I bought it immediately.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The day I turned 50, I felt a mysterious surge of what I could only think of as power</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I was not a happy or a healthy young person. I had chronic asthma exacerbated by smoking; I was unfit; my diet was ordinary. \u201cOrphaned\u201d by 29, I spent most of my 20s and 30s in grief. I was deeply anxious with little confidence, my fretful neediness causing relationship problems. For many of those years, I cried every week.</p> <p>The day I turned 50, I felt a mysterious surge of what I could only think of as power. A deep optimism, energy and peacefulness took up space inside me. Give or take a few crises since, it hasn\u2019t really left. In my mid-50s I\u2019m physically and emotionally stronger, healthier, more calmly loved and loving, more productive, more organised, smarter, wealthier and exponentially happier than I ever was in my youth. In the past four years I\u2019ve really cried about three times, on one occasion because a good friend died.</p> <p>I mentioned my mid-life happiness at a public event once. A woman in the audience called out cheerfully, \u201cYou think it\u2019s great when you\u2019re 50 \u2013 wait till you\u2019re 70!\u201d</p> <p>There are global studies showing what\u2019s called \u201cthe paradox of age\u201d, a U-curve revealing that from childhood onwards happiness declines, and then dramatically rises. We\u2019re most miserable in our 40s, but things pick up around 50; happiness at 90 far exceeds that at 18. This upswing is partly owing to life experience, but is also a direct result of getting older, <a href=\"https://www.margithenderson.com/the-paradox-of-aging-the-happiness-u-curve/\">say psychologists</a>: \u201cThe biological, cognitive and emotional changes of ageing itself \u2026 result in better emotional regulation, greater equanimity and compassion, more comfort with ambiguity, deeper gratitude and a focus upon meaningful engagement in the present.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4093739fbc5bcdacb5d3c510968d2dbc8edfb641\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4093739fbc5bcdacb5d3c510968d2dbc8edfb641/0_0_618_800/386.jpg\" alt=\"Birthday card with woman in retro suit and the phrase honey, you couldn't pay me to be twenty\" width=\"386\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Birthday card from the website annetaintor.com</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: annetaintor.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Having published a novel about older women, I\u2019m now seeing evidence of joyful, mischievous ageing everywhere I go. A woman at a book event tells me that at 77, she\u2019d resigned herself to a life that was winding down, finishing up. Instead, she says in astonishment, \u201cI can\u2019t stop the ideas coming. I just have ideas and ideas and ideas!\u201d She motions with both hands outwards from her head, in a delighted gesture of pouring abundance. Her husband sits beside her, beaming.</p> <p>Another day I overhear two women \u2013 perhaps they\u2019re 80 \u2013 outside a cinema. One tells the other she\u2019s being badgered to visit her daughter, a long drive away in the country. She looks into the middle distance, then says serenely, \u201cI think she wants me to go before I <em>lose my licence.</em>\u201d The two women look at each other for a second, then burst into wild cackles. They gather their bags and stride into the movie house.</p> <p>***</p> <p>What am I afraid of, when I think about old age? I\u2019d like to say nothing, but that would be untrue. Dementia, obviously. Relentless physical pain so bad it eclipses small pleasures. Being forced to live with people I dislike. Loss of autonomy. The kind of poverty that destroys autonomy. Unstinting boredom caused by an inability to read or hear.</p> <p>I fear becoming a bitter, self-pitying person. Taking up genealogy. Boring other people to death with my \u2018wonderful stories\u2019.</p> <p>What am I not afraid of? Living alone. Being \u201cinvisible\u201d. The body\u2019s gradual decline, notwithstanding the above. Death.</p> <p>It\u2019s possible I\u2019m completely deluded. When these things befall me, I\u2019ll probably be terrified.</p> <p>***</p> <p>In \u201cWhy we can\u2019t tell the truth about ageing\u201d, an article in the New Yorker, Arthur Krystal sneers at the recent proliferation of \u201cfeel-good\u201d books about getting older. It\u2019s sheer trendiness to put a positive spin on growing old, Krystal grouches: the truth is, it sucks \u2013 please let\u2019s stop the lying.</p> <p>Unconvinced by the U-curve, then.</p> <p>But he has a point. It\u2019s true that alongside the horror and revulsion there has now emerged quite a bit of jolly crusading about the fabulousness of old age. Like Krystal, I too find irksome the anti-ageism books refusing to acknowledge the downsides, those calling for a special new language with which to \u201ccelebrate\u201d ageing. Ditto the idiotic, sappy memes that pop up now and then on social media. (Wrinkles are engraved smiles? Jesus Christ.) Nor am I drawn to heartwarming movies in the genre that New York Times critic Neil Genzlinger calls Old People Behaving Hilariously. I cheer when Anjelica Huston sniffs her disdain for \u201capologetically humble or humiliating\u201d film roles, like one in \u201can old-lady cheerleader movie\u201d. I\u2019m with you, Anjelica, I think. When I\u2019m 67 I want my work taken seriously, too. But then I see a response from Jacki Weaver, who\u2019s in the old-lady cheerleader movie. When she read Huston\u2019s comments, Weaver says, \u201cI just laughed. And then I said, \u2018Well, she can go fuck herself.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>I snort jubilantly into my coffee cup. Go, Jacki. I\u2019m with you, too.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Palliative care nurses have told me people almost always die as they live. A person who has lived with acceptance and gratitude will die in gracious acceptance. One who\u2019s lived in bitterness and entitlement and anger will likely die in the same state. Suddenly it\u2019s blindingly obvious to me that ageing is the same; all our prior years are practice for the hard stuff of getting old. When I think of the old individuals I know who express delight and curiosity, a sense of purpose and appreciation, in ordinary daily life, I realise that give or take a few tragedies, they\u2019ve always been this way. It\u2019s their default state. When I think of the unhappiest old people I know \u2013 victimised, spiteful, ungrateful for small pleasures, eternally dissatisfied and offended \u2013 I look back and see those traits governing their early and middle years too.</p> <p>Note to self: Practise hard.</p> <p>Question to self: When is it too late to change one\u2019s default state?</p> <p>***</p> <p>The Good Weekend magazine carries an account of life in a nursing home (\u201cone of the good ones\u201d) by a perceptive retired journalist in his early 80s.

We\u2019ll keep writing, painting, performing. How could we stop, anyway? We wouldn\u2019t want to stop. We talk about Matisse and his paper cut-outs, Edna O\u2019Brien, Wallace Stegner. Adapting, accepting, but always making, always working.</p> <p>None of us states the obvious: we\u2019re not Matisse, or O\u2019Brien, or Stegner. Nobody talks about what will happen when nobody wants our work any more.</p> <p>***</p> <p>In recent years it\u2019s come to me that the point of all our living is to get ready to die. People laugh when I say this out loud. How morbid to think of death all the time! But I don\u2019t find it morbid. I find it interesting, a purposeful exercise, considering how to live \u2013 to strive towards living \u2013 with that readiness inside us.</p> <p>The Jungian psychologist James Hillman posits that the purpose of human ageing is to fulfil our true character, to become our essential selves. More radically, he suggests that ageing might be \u201ca transformation in beauty as much as in biology\u201d.

I think the deepest dread is of being reduced, simplified. We\u2019re afraid that, to paraphrase British psychologist and writer Susie Orbach, we\u2019ll be \u201crobbed of the richness of who we are\u201d \u2013 our complexity stripped away by forces beyond our control. This reduction is already happening with the cheerleaders on one side, the catastrophisers on the other.

In the days preceding the match headlines celebrated the demand for tickets as Optus Stadium turned Perth Glory purple in preparation for the domestic game\u2019s marquee fixture.</p> <p>The contrast with the corresponding weekend this season could not be starker. The A-League, like sporting competitions around the world, is waiting for its opportunity to return to action amid the Covid-19 pandemic. There is nothing to hype. Fans are not flocking anywhere and there are no heated debates about premiers-elect Sydney FC squatting in Western Sydney Wanderers\u2019 home for the day. On the plus side there can be no VAR catastrophe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/23/give-up-on-the-w-league-to-keep-a-league-going-thats-just-crazy\">Give up on the W-League to keep A-League going? That's just crazy | Samantha Lewis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Compared with many other major sporting events in Australia the A-League grand final is neither blessed nor burdened by symbolism; it doesn\u2019t command a fixed date or time in the diary, nor does it occupy a permanent home that welcomes an annual pilgrimage. Consequently its absence has not created heightened levels of introspection or angst. Right now, that suits Football Federation Australia and the game\u2019s leaders just fine as they quietly try to plot a course through troubled waters.</p> <p>Little has been said on the record about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/06/australian-sport-prepares-to-restart-how-and-when-major-competitions-will-resume\">the process to resume the A-League </a>campaign, and football\u2019s powerbrokers are keen not to draw attention to the topic. This is a marker of how delicate negotiations are proving to be, especially with broadcast partner Fox Sports. The competition\u2019s hiatus has provided <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/16/australian-footballs-fox-sports-conundrum-looming-disaster-or-reset-opportunity\">an opportunity for a reconsideration</a> of the $57m per year relationship between league and broadcaster. The outcome of that process will have knock-on effects for the rest of the football pyramid.</p> <p>The stakes are raised further by longstanding sponsors <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/socceroos-on-the-hunt-for-new-naming-rights-sponsor-20191226-p53mza.html\">drifting away</a> from the game, most concerningly Hyundai, with the A-League\u2019s naming rights partner <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/ffa-suffers-6m-hit-after-losing-major-a-league-sponsor-hyundai-20200512-p54sa2.html\">reportedly on the verge </a>of ending its 15-year association. The economic climate could hardly be less conducive to finding swift replacements at commensurate levels.</p> <p>Meanwhile the governance process that sparked years of upheaval has still to be resolved and the A-League yet to decouple from FFA almost 12 months since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/01/a-league-clubs-to-take-control-of-competition-in-new-deal-with-ffa\">recommendations were approved </a>for an alternative operating model for the professional leagues.</p> <p>Despite this dystopian scene there isn\u2019t the whiff of panic that has accompanied similar pinch points in Australian football\u2019s chequered past. For now at least, there is a working alignment between administrators, clubs and players about the way forward. Little is leaking from confidential negotiations. Dissenting voices are not speaking out loudly. Collective self-interest appears to be having the desired effect.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, much of the credit for the consensus is being directed towards FFA chief executive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/01/2020-vision-needed-for-australian-football-as-james-johnson-era-begins\">James Johnson</a>. Despite being in post just six months he is earning praise for steering the governing body through the crisis while coordinating the heavyweights of the professional game. As previous football administrators would be only too quick to attest, that is no mean feat. His leadership was considered crucial in securing the most recent $12m tranche of broadcast money, a sum that arrived late and was feared may never be released.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s honeymoon period has him in the public\u2019s good books too, for the time being. Already in the black for being a \u201cfootball person\u201d, the announcement at the end of April of the <a href=\"https://www.ffa.com.au/news/experienced-starting-xi-help-drive-australian-football-forward\">Starting XI </a>advisory panel that belatedly brings Socceroo legend Mark Viduka back into the fold generated a truckload of goodwill just as lockdown threatened to spiral into endless online handwringing. It also demonstrated the current iteration of FFA was alert to open PR goals, all the while keeping rubberneckers at arm\u2019s length from the main event.</p> <p>As that main event progresses and plans for all eventualities are modelled there remains confidence at the top of the game, however the dice may fall. This is enabled in part by the sense of liberation accompanying the widely acknowledged need for a system reboot. With such a mindset an emergency can provide fertile ground for change. Or, as Rahm Emanuel, White House Chief of Staff to Barack Obama, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mzcbXi1Tkk\">put it</a>: \u201cYou never let a serious crisis go to waste\u2026 it\u2019s an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before.\u201d</p> <p>As with all attempts at reading the tea leaves during this unprecedented crisis there is only so much to glean before circumstances take over. There will doubtless be speedbumps further down the road once revenues - unavoidably diminished - come to be redistributed, testing the relationships between current allies. But while there is alignment at the highest level (however temporary that may prove) the well-practiced urge to despair about the state of Australian football can hold off, for now. For a game no stranger to anguish, it\u2019s no toilet seat, but it\u2019s a grand final victory of sorts.</p> <p><br></p>",

It sounds gruesome, but really that\u2019s so far what they\u2019re banking on to beat Trump.</p> <p>\u201cAnd in this case, Trump is absolutely smarter than that and what he is offering, not only his base but voters in swing states, is hope. It\u2019d actually be reminiscent, in a much less articulate way, of Ronald Reagan. He\u2019s basically saying, \u2018I got you to the promised land economically once, I will get you back to the promised land economically again\u2019.</p> <p>Schiller added: \u201cTrump will run on a message of hope from now until November, and he\u2019ll basically dare the Democrats to prove him wrong. And then he\u2019ll say, \u2018You don\u2019t believe in America. You\u2019re betting against America.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very interesting corner that he\u2019s boxing the Democrats into and I think they\u2019re hoping that people realise that the mismanagement of messaging on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/what-is-covid-19\">Covid</a> and additional things like tariffs against China and supply chains undermine Trump, but those are very sophisticated arguments to make. When the Democrats have to make sophisticated arguments, the Democrats lose.

  "<p>In Leipzig the players bumped elbows and grinned like this was all a little bit silly. In Dortmund Erling Haaland scored the first goal of football\u2019s plague times and stood by the corner flag with his teammates around him in a celebratory pastiche of social distancing, a strangely haunting image that will, you suspect, be recycled many times.</p> \n<p>Welcome to the new abnormal normal. Which is, needless to say, a fairly strange place to be. And yet for all the oddity of its staging, something did seem to shift over the 90 minutes of Borussia Dortmund\u2019s 4-0 defeat of Schalke at Signal Iduna Park, one of six comeback fixtures to take place in the Bundesliga, two months since football \u2013 and that rather less urgent entity, the world \u2013 went into standby mode.</p> \n<p>There was encouragement here for the industry. By the end it wasn\u2019t too hard to see how televised football might re-emerge as a functioning entity. No spitting. No hugging. No fans.

There were early moments of double-take. No doubt the sight of players arriving in protective gear on sparsely occupied buses will become commonplace in time.</p> \n<p>There was the deeply weird sight of the masked subs spread in a line in their large leather touchline seats, a row of ejected fighter pilots. Both sets of players grinned and shrugged as they warmed up in front of empty stands. At one point Haaland burst out laughing.</p> \n<p>Signal Iduna Park was a poignant venue in this respect, a ground that is as much as any in Europe an emblem of the importance of here and now and being present. This is an unshowy footballing giant, lodged in the leafy flatlands of the Ruhr and circled by low-lying industrial hubs. On match days the walkways are crammed with sausage stalls and beer taps. This is the essence of Dortmund, the place where the club\u2019s heart is located. They had 81,365 in here for the last home game, in February. The contrast in the opening seconds was stark. Why are we actually playing, you kept wondering as the ball was passed around with a forced sense of urgency and Dortmund in particular seemed to be playing through a laudanum haze.</p> \n<p>There is, of course, a note of weirdness in the basic idea of football as our first shared step to normality. There\u2019s a famous Dave Chapelle joke about MTV broadcasting the views of the rapper Ja Rule shortly after the Word Trade Centre was taken down. As Chapelle points out: \u201cI want some answers that Ja Rule might not have right now.\u201d Perhaps there are those among us who felt all along that one day Steve McManaman would be the voice to guide our first tentative steps out of a global pandemic. But then football was always likely to jostle its way to the front of this queue, to plonk its tankard down on the bar for first helpings.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8dcabd9edd086f28c1289c6f0943166f0ebe682\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8dcabd9edd086f28c1289c6f0943166f0ebe682/119_0_2506_1504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Schalke\u2019s players enter the stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Schalke\u2019s players enter the stadium.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Meissner/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>And it must be said BT Sport\u2019s pared-back team did a fine job with a deeply odd occasion.

By debunking the glories of British history, and undermining religious and educational standards, they were turning the British into a rootless mob unable to act in its own or the national interest.</p> <p>Leftwing moralists reached the same conclusion but took a different road to hell. Capitalism turned citizens into consumers, who thought only of themselves. \u201cA market society automatically carries with it an undermining of solidarity,\u201d <a href=\"https://noam-chomsky.tumblr.com/post/68780384732/even-trying-to-stimulate-consumerism-is-an-effort\">declared</a> Noam Chomsky. It generates selfish individualists, unable to stick together. In our day, liberals have explained away Brexit, Trump and populism by citing the willingness of tens of millions to listen to idiot demagogues rather than the educated.</p> <p>And yet here we are, shorn of most traditional beliefs, the undoubted products of consumer capitalism, and still more or less sticking together and obeying the medical elite. I could go on in the style of George Orwell or JB Priestley at their sentimental worst and praise British decency. Although it exists in millions \u2013 whoever thought that it did not? \u2013 surely the reason why the British and so many other populations are obedient is that they are terrified. The only way the authorities can begin to clear up the mess they have made of this crisis is by understanding our fears and showing us how to improvise ways round them. Unfortunately, they show no sign of doing it.</p> <p>I should emphasise that the fear is a fear of the virus, not of the government. At the start of the crisis, many warned of the creation of a police state. They had every reason to be alarmed. Ministers had ordered the population to stay at home, as if it were an invading army imposing a curfew. Their <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/129/regulation/7/made\">emergency regulations</a> allowed the police and public health officials to <a href=\"https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/issue/coronavirus-policing/\">detain, test and interrogate</a> everyone they thought might be infectious, and force them into quarantine if required. We were, in the words of the former supreme court judge Lord Sumption, losing our freedom in a fit of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/coronavirus-outbreak-uk-hysteria-lord-sumption-supreme-court-a9435981.html\">collective hysteria</a>\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A police state requires police officers willing to enforce a dictatorship. The police aren\u2019t prepared to do it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As it has turned out, the hysteria has been on Sumption\u2019s side of the argument. A police state requires police officers willing to enforce a dictatorship. The police aren\u2019t prepared to do it. Nor has the Johnson government asked them to, for whatever faults the hopeless man has, he\u2019s not a dictator in the making. Correct me if I have missed them, but I can find no reports of officers herding the sick into quarantine. The police in England and Wales have merely issued about <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52489943\">9,000 fines</a> for breaking the lockdown \u2013 usually to young people out in public spaces without reasonable excuse. I don\u2019t want to underestimate how the determination to protect the old by denying education and social life to the young will haunt this country for decades. But to put the punishments into perspective, the French police had issued 915,000 <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.fr/20200423/french-police-hand-out-over-900000-in-lockdown-fines-including-to-holiday-home-owners\">fines for breaking the lockdown</a> as of 23 April \u2013 100 times as many. You can either believe that the English and Welsh are 100 times more law-abiding than the French or that chief constables have, on the whole, trusted the public to behave sensibly if given a little leeway. If there had been a determined effort by even 10% of the population to break the lockdown, it would never had held. As it is, people have done what was asked of them, more or less.</p> <p>Having denigrated their fellow citizens for decades, moralists have seized on the solidarity. Rather than realising that people were hiding from a terrifying plague, Tories decided the nation was rallying round the flag and seeing Johnson as a new Churchill. From the other side, I have heard leftists bend the Tory line for their own purposes and assure me we are witnessing the public sacrificing its freedom for the sake of the NHS. The peak of the self-congratulation came in early May when the BBC ran <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000hyp4\">a propaganda series,</a> <em>Our Finest Hours</em>. It would show \u201chow the outbreak of Covid-19 has revived our nation\u2019s wartime spirit and once again we can be proud to be British,\u201d the tastelessly upbeat narrator told viewers. \u201cNow, as we did in World War Two, we are uniting in a common endeavour.\u201d</p> <p>Sceptics could counter with the revelations of the unforgivable failure, not just of Johnson but also of the government\u2019s scientific advisers, to lock down soon enough. They might point to NHS managers\u2019 willingness to send infected patients into <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2020-05-14/care-homes-coronavirus-crisis/\">care homes</a> and to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52671814\">threaten</a> doctors who spoke out about the shortages of protective equipment. Not much common endeavour to be proud of there.</p> <p>Realists would do better to return to what matters above all else: the fear. There may never be a vaccine. Even if there is and it is available to all \u2013 a big if \u2013 the virus may mutate. We will need new ways of living with the fear outside lockdown. Indeed, we need them now. Yet, instead of explaining to people how they can safely travel and work, the government is reverting to its thuggish type. It is <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/gavin-williamson-teaching-unions-must-do-their-duty-and-get-children-back-to-school\">picking fights with teachers\u2019 unions</a> asking reasonable questions about how schools can reopen. Instead of realising that the cooperation of the mayor of London is essential if the capital is to reopen, it <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11629649/sadiq-khan-hikes-fares-conjestion-charge-gov-bailout/\">goes for him</a> because he\u2019s Labour and a remainer and therefore an enemy.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just that the government is gnawing away at national self-respect, to use Thatcher\u2019s words. If it can\u2019t find the authority and patience to convince the public to overcome its fears, it will gnaw away at the nation\u2019s security.</p> <p>\u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist</p>",

That is dangerously close to levels that could bring a second wave of infections.

  "<p><strong>Wind of Change</strong> (podcast) | <a href=\"https://crooked.com/podcast-series/wind-of-change/\">Spotify</a> <br><strong>Scarlett Moffatt Wants to Believe</strong> (podcast) | <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08c6f5x\">BBC Sounds</a></p> <p>Here\u2019s a great new podcast for fans of bonkers conspiracy theories and billowing hair-metal ballads. And for everyone else, too. <strong><a href=\"https://crooked.com/podcast-series/wind-of-change/\">Wind of Change</a></strong>, an eight-part series released in one go on Spotify and week by week everywhere else, is a fascinating listen from Brooklyn\u2019s <a href=\"http://pineapple.fm/ourshows\">Pineapple Street Studios</a>, with one of the snappiest elevator pitches ever. Was the 1990 lighters-aloft anthem Wind of Change by Scorpions actually written by the CIA?</p> <p>Well: was it? You\u2019re going to have to listen to find out, but anyone who has read Jon Ronson\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2004/nov/21/politics\">The Men Who Stare at Goats</a></em><em> </em>or watched Ben Affleck in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/nov/11/argo-affleck-review\">Argo</a></em><em> </em>will know that such loopy US soft power efforts are not beyond the realms of possibility. Investigative journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/15/wind-of-change-did-the-cia-write-the-cold-wars-biggest-anthem\">Patrick Radden Keefe</a> is the man who takes us on the long (sometimes too long) journey towards the truth, and he works hard to do so, travelling to Kiev (pronounced Keev, who knew?), Lagos and the Cayman Islands in his efforts to track down the true writer of such classic couplets as \u201cThe future\u2019s in the air / I can feel it everywhere\u201d. Like a drop of ink in water, the story blossoms and spreads, stains what seemed previously clear.</p> <p>This tale involves close-mouthed people, but what we do learn is interesting: about the jobs that people go to when they leave the CIA (many become wealth advisers, apparently); about how spies tend to be charming and gregarious, while never telling you anything. We learn that other recruits have a career in Hollywood and are approached by the CIA for help with, say, facial disguises. We meet band managers, concert organisers, fans and drug runners, as well as Klaus Meine, Scorpions\u2019 frontman (in the last episode).</p> <p>If you find yourself waiting for the story to take off, be warned: it doesn\u2019t, really. Instead, Keefe\u2019s questions begin to spiral into themselves, burrow down, flare out. It takes him some time to realise a music journalism truism: a hit song is written by the times in which it exists as much as by its actual songwriter. Still, <em>Wind of Change</em> is a beautifully constructed listen, never less than entertaining. I burned through it in a day and loved every minute.</p> <p>Another conspiracy theory podcast launches this week, but this one, <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08c6f5x\">Scarlett Moffatt Wants to Believe</a></strong>, is less meticulous, more sofa-based. Ex-Goggleboxer Moffatt, as she explains in the first episode, has always been obsessed by conspiracy theories, as has her dad. Not just conspiracy theories either; her dad used to take her out looking for crop circles and hid essential supplies in the attic for him and her, in order to be ready for a zombie apocalypse. (Her mum said she didn\u2019t want to hold them back from their escape, what with her asthma, and would rather just be turned into a zombie and get it over with.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3339d3745237066adba31cf567c2335465f7e481\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3339d3745237066adba31cf567c2335465f7e481/0_0_3440_2063/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scarlett Moffatt.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Easy company\u2026 conspiracy theory obsessive Scarlett Moffatt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Fisher/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Scarlett presents with her boyfriend Scott Dobinson, who provides the cynical counterpoint to her excited waffle. This is a BBC podcast, so there needs to be balance, and Scott is it. What this means is that Moffatt brings up, say, the Roswell incident, and Dobinson points out, quite reasonably, that it was a long time ago, that the witnesses were unreliable, that the US government has said the \u201cUFO\u201d was a surveillance balloon. \u201cStoooop!\u201d wails Moffatt, as Dobinson also says that the one real witness was well known to embellish his stories, having falsely claimed to be a pilot with five air medals for shooting down planes. \u201cWe\u2019ve all exaggerated stories, doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s a liar!\u201d says Moffatt. She\u2019ll never be a lawyer.</p> <p>The main problem with the podcast\u2019s premise is that Moffatt\u2019s \u201cevidence\u201d is pretty pathetic: nothing more than a quick Wiki would cough up (actually, less than that). But of course that\u2019s not really the point. <em>SMWTB</em> is aimed at the<a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/sma\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/sma\">Sh**ged, Married, Annoyed</a></em> market, with our happy couple\u2019s silly bickering providing the podcast\u2019s true appeal, rather than any definitive proof of, for example, whether the moon landings actually happened (clue: they did). And in that the podcast succeeds: Moffatt and Dobinson are delightful people, and spending an easy 40 minutes with them is a nice thing to do. I just wouldn\u2019t send either of them on any \u201cdid MI5 write Coldplay\u2019s Fix You?\u201d missions just yet.</p> <h2>Three podcasts about out-of-lockdown love</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://art19.com/shows/swipe-left-swipe-left\">Swipe Left Swipe Left</a></strong><br>Swiping left or right is not a realistic option <em>en ce moment</em>, unless you can convince yourself that a successful hook-up involves socially distanced tennis or an afternoon\u2019s deer-stalking. Still, <em>SLSL</em>, now in its second series, is a nice way to remind yourself of the ups and downs of dating. Mostly, the downs. The new series opens with a disastrous and thoroughly cringe-making story based around a cheese shop. Exemplary use of music (by which I mean, it makes me laugh), plus a genuinely hot episode (episode four) \u2013 <em>Swipe Left</em>\u2019s love stories are very sweet short listens.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://media.nationalarchives.gov.uk/index.php/category/podcasts-2/\">The National Archives: Love</a></strong><br>Britain\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/\">National Archives</a> has had a podcast since 2006, but has recently started using its vast resources to make a few three-part miniseries called <em>On </em><em>the Record</em>, about spies, protest and, now, love. Each episode uses letters to illustrate an aspect of love: disappointed or forbidden love, and love divided, so far. Whether these letters are between gay lovers when homosexuality was illegal, or between Queen Elizabeth I and Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, they are revealing in the hands of presenters and National Archive employees Matt Norman and Katie Fox. Norman and Fox\u2019s hosting can be a little stodgy, but their analysis is great.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p087hgm1/episodes/downloads\">You\u2019ll Do</a></strong><br>Catherine Bohart and Sarah Keyworth are comedians separately and in a relationship together, and this newish podcast has them talking to other couples about different aspects of being and staying together. Is there such a thing as a perfect date night? (No.) Fast-talking and quick-witted, there is very little that Bohart and Keyworth won\u2019t talk about. They manage to keep things moving with their guests, while getting into the nitty-gritty and unpicking roles and triggers within relationships. Plus, their selection of couples (not always heteronormative) makes this a more interesting podcast than most of this kind.</p>",

Well, not in the UK, not yet. But over in Germany, the Bundesliga today becomes the first major division to get back up and running in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. And what a place to pick things up again: Borussia Dortmund versus Schalke! The Revierderby! The rumble in the Ruhr! The noise in North Rhine-Westphalia! The ... hey, let us shake off some MBM rust, will you, it\u2019s been a while. You get the gist.</p> <p><strong>So about that rumble and noise ... </strong>BVB\u2019s Westfalenstadion is arguably the most atmospheric ground in Europe, the Yellow Wall, all that. But not today. This game will be played behind closed doors, with only 213 people allowed in. That number takes in players, managers and staff, officials and ballboys, medical folk, camera operators and other assorted media types. There\u2019ll be no handshakes, no team photos, no mascots. No cheering, no chanting. The rest of the 2019-20 Bundesliga season will be played out like this. Nine eerie games to go.</p> <p><strong>The tragic realities of Covid-19 aside, this is a shame for a more trivial reason. </strong>The Revierderby has always generated one hell of an atmosphere. Take 1969, for example, when Schalke took the lead at Dortmund. Fans staged a celebratory pitch invasion, and were chased back into the stands by police dogs. Amid the brouhaha, an Alsatian sunk his teeth into the most padded portion of Schalke defender Friedel Rausch\u2019s shorts. It later transpired that this particular hound had nothing to do with the police, but was brought in by a sassy Dortmund fan posing as a peeler to gain free entry! When Schalke hosted the reverse fixture later that season, their president Gunter Siebert responded to events by patrolling the pitch with <em>a lion</em>. Forget that miserable old saw about Germans having no sense of humour: this was, quite literally, satire with teeth.</p> <p><strong>Fifty-one years on ...</strong> and the Dortmund of 2020 are chasing their first Bundesliga title since the Jurgen Klopp era; since 2012 to be precise. They\u2019re currently four points behind reigning champions Bayern Munich. Schalke are well off the pace in sixth spot, but if they can hinder their rivals\u2019 title challenge this afternoon, it\u2019ll make up for an awful lot. Schalke started the season well under new boss David Wagner, formerly of Huddersfield Town and Dortmund reserves, but the enforced break came at a good time for them: they\u2019ve only won once in eight league games since the winter break, a 2-0 victory over Borussia Monchengladbach in January, and were recently battered 5-0 at home by RB Leipzig. Lucien Favre\u2019s black and yellows, by contrast, are on a four-match winning run, though that comes with the obvious caveats and asterisks. The hosts will be the favourites today.</p> <p><strong>And yet Schalke will take heart from their last two visits to the Westfalenstadion.</strong> In 2017, they came back from four goals down after 25 minutes to grab an absurd 4-4 draw, while they won 4-2 last season as Dortmund\u2019s title bid spluttered out horribly. On both occasions, Dortmund had men sent off. They haven\u2019t won this fixture since 2015. So despite the strange, sterile, mid-pandemic atmosphere, today\u2019s Revierderby still has the potential to thrill. It\u2019s Der BVB! It\u2019s Die Knappen! It\u2019s one of the biggest rivalries in world football! It is, once again, on!</p> <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> Too soon, some will undoubtedly say. But they\u2019ll get the ball rolling at 3.30pm in Dortmund, 2.30pm UK time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb50706d2bc70d2a3ea528bf1870ca3d3036a1c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb50706d2bc70d2a3ea528bf1870ca3d3036a1c5/0_0_3500_2330/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ballboys disinfect the balls before the match.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ballboys disinfect the balls before the match.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-16T13:08:24.860Z\">at 2.08pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

An Associated Press review in late April found little consensus among states on basic questions such as how many investigators are needed. <br> </p> <p>Contact tracing was one of the \u201ccore state preparedness responsibilities\u201d outlined in the White House guidelines for reopening the country, but governors have been pressing ahead with lifting restrictions without having comprehensive programs in place.</p> <p>Hall county, which has over 200,000 residents and the second-highest rate of coronavirus cases in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/state-of-georgia\">Georgia</a>, has between 30 and 40 contact tracers assigned to the local public health district, which also serves a dozen neighboring counties. It hopes to receive an additional 30 from the state.</p> <p>Georgia was among the first states to ease restrictions. Public health experts have expressed concern that the state was risking a spike in cases by moving too quickly. So far, the state has hired 250 contact tracers with a goal of reaching 1,000.</p> <p>While there is no federal formula for how many of the disease detectives are needed, public health experts have said one contact tracer is needed for every 1,000 to 3,000 residents in the US, or between 100,000 and 300,000 nationally. For Georgia, that would be between 3,333 and 10,000.</p> <p>During congressional testimony this past week, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, reiterated his concern that parts of the US might be easing restrictions too early without having the ability to respond effectively to an increase in cases with \u201cgood identification, isolation and contact tracing\u201d.</p> <p>The next day, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released general guidance to states on contact tracing. It said the number of cases investigators and contact tracers needed in each community \u201cmay be large\u201d and will vary, in part due to caseloads. <br> </p> <p>Under California\u2019s criteria for a broader reopening, counties should have 15 people trained in contact tracing for every 100,000 residents. The state is helping, working to train between 10,000 and 20,000 tracers, but most large counties are falling short. <br> </p> <p>Harris county, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas\">Texas</a>\u2019s most populous with more than 4.7 million residents, is working to train about 300 contact tracers by 22 May.

  "<p>Britain\u2019s property market has proved to be a cornerstone of economic activity for decades.

The anxiety surrounding the path of the coronavirus pandemic, and the prospect of thousands of businesses going bust and millions of people becoming unemployed, will keep a lid on the recovery.</p> <p>\u201cSome people have already lost their jobs, despite the supportive government measures, while others may be worried that they could still end up losing their job once the furlough scheme ends,\u201d he says. \u201cAdditionally, many incomes have been negatively affected. Consumer confidence is currently at or near record low levels on many measures, and many people are likely to remain cautious for some time to come with regards to making major spending decisions such as buying or moving house.\u201d</p> <p>Archer is one of the more optimistic analysts of the property market, expecting a fall in prices of just 5% over the next few months and a flattening-out by the end of the year. The average house price in the UK was \u00a3230,000 in February, down 0.3% on the previous month, according to the Office for National Statistics. There are much less modest declines to come, say experts.</p> <p>The Centre for Economics and Business Research predicts that prices in 2020 will be down 13% \u201cas a lack of transactions, high uncertainty and falling incomes take their toll\u201d.</p> <p>In the first weeks of the pandemic, property agency Knight Frank said it anticipated a fall of 3% in 2020 before increasing this forecast to 7% last week. Its analysis suggested prices had fallen 5% since March, with further pain for sellers to come.</p> <p>Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics), says: \u201cI suspect people will be fairly wary.\u201d</p> <p>He adds that while the easing of restrictions will unlock transactions already in the pipeline and encourage those who need to move for work or family reasons, most people will wait to see how their circumstances develop before buying.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2020-05-15T23:14:01/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Average house prices since 2009\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2020-05-15T23:14:01/embed.html\">Average house prices since 2009</a> </figure>  <p>High-end property agent Henry Pryor says his clients are looking for 20% discounts, though they are likely to agree on a figure nearer 10%.</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know where prices are going to be at the end of the year and whether they will be in negative equity,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Rubinsohn says buyers have also found they may want to consider aspects of a property that were not so important three months ago.</p> <p>\u201cThey might want to put a garden or balcony higher up their agenda, or put more time into considering the merits of city life versus something more rural,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cI am not sure we are able to make judgments about which way people are going to jump. It is too early to say. But there is certainly the potential for people to rethink what they want from their next home.\u201d</p> <p>Trends that were developing before the pandemic hit could be accelerated as the lockdown eases. If commercial properties become less attractive to employers following a shift to home working, a trend to convert empty offices into apartments could pick up pace.</p> <p>Rubinsohn warns that this may not be good news for buyers after <a href=\"https://www.rics.org/uk/news-insight/research/research-reports/assessing-the-impacts-of-extending-permitted-development-rights-to-office-to-residential-change-of-use-in-england/\" title=\"\">a report by academics at University College London</a> for Rics found developers had taken the opportunity of weak planning rules to produce substandard homes that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48fbe55c-ffb2-11e8-ac00-57a2a826423e\" title=\"\">one critic dubbed \u201cthe slums of the future\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Other trends could reverse. A drift to the city could come to an abrupt end as the prospect of rejoining the morning commuter crush loses its appeal. And the hollowing-out of town centre high streets could be turned around if the prospect of queuing at an out-of-town supermarket is tarnished and buying from local shops is seen as safer.</p> <p>The promise of historically low interest rates for the next two years \u2013 and most likely a decade or more \u2013 could underpin this transition, but the route back to a more normal level of transactions will be slow.</p> <p>Archer says: \u201cVery low borrowing costs should also help matters, with the Bank of England unlikely to lift interest rates from 0.1% until well into 2021. Even so, we expect house price gains to be no more than 2-3% in 2021.\u201d</p> <p>Rubinsohn argues that the government will need to consider tax breaks or subsidies to kickstart the market before housebuilders consider limiting the supply of new homes further.</p> <p>\u201cWithout help, and especially as unemployment increases, the housing market recovery is going to be slow. It will be a hard slog,\u201d he says.</p> <h2>Case studies of a troubled market</h2> <p><strong>The buyers</strong><br>Ed Fireman, 54, and his wife Sue, 53, were raring to go when the property market reopened on Wednesday.

  "<p>Rough sleepers should be given permanent accommodation rather than being allowed to drift back on to the streets as the lockdown eases, according to the Conservative chair of the all-party parliamentary group for ending homelessness.</p> <p>The majority of England\u2019s rough sleepers have been moved off the streets and into hotels to offer them protection during the pandemic.</p> <p>Bob Blackman said the government should now seize the opportunity to introduce the \u201chousing-first\u201d model, which sees rough sleepers given a permanent place to live as a priority before interventions in any other issues in their lives. This initiative is already used by a number of other countries such as Finland and Denmark.</p> <p>\u201cIt is my belief that the housing first model is the way to deal with what will be needed after coronavirus,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, people who are rough sleeping are taken off the street and given a property, and then assessed as to what their needs are. Support is then placed around them, and any medical needs are attended to so that they can recover and move on to a normal way of life\u201d.</p> <p>He said that while the government had done a good job to get the homeless community into hotel accommodation during the pandemic \u201cthere is no plan from the top yet\u201d to ensure that people stay housed.</p> <p>On Friday a leaked report suggested that government funding for the emergency scheme \u2013 Councils were given \u00a33.2m in March \u2013 is to end.

During two years of social distancing on a farm he came up with important new mathematical insights and started formulating his theory of gravity.</p> <p>My own quarantine experience has largely consisted of attempting to complete Netflix. However, last week I decided to channel Newton and conduct some scientific experiments of my own. I stood in my local New York park counting passers-by to see if there were any gender differences in mask-wearing. Please don\u2019t judge me: at least I didn\u2019t spend my spare time starting a podcast.</p> <p>The results of my study, A Sociological Park-Based Meta-Analysis of Gendered Mask Habits (due to be published in the Journal of Arwa\u2019s Thoughts) were unequivocal. Men were just as likely to wear masks as women. In face-coverings, at least, we had achieved gender equality!</p> <p>It is with a great deal of disappointment, then, that I must announce that my findings have been refuted by a rather more robust study. A <a href=\"https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/equality/497814-men-less-likely-to-wear-face-masks-because-theyre-not-cool\">new survey</a> of 2,459 people living in the US has found that men are less likely to don face masks because they believe wearing one is \u201cshameful,\u201d \u201ca sign of weakness,\u201d and \u201cnot cool.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://psyarxiv.com/tg7vz/\">survey</a>, conducted by American and British researchers, also found that men are less likely to believe they\u2019ll be significantly impacted by Covid-19 than women. Which is ironic, because there is a huge amount of evidence showing that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/men-are-much-more-likely-to-die-from-coronavirus-b\">men are much more likely to die</a> from coronavirus. Researchers are still trying to figure out whether this is due to <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/more-men-than-women-are-dying-from-covid-19-is-it-biology-or-behavior/\">biology or behaviour</a>.</p> <p>Interestingly, the study found gender differences in intentions to wear a face covering basically disappeared in places were masks were made mandatory. In other words: men need to be forced to wear masks more than women do. You\u2019re obliged to wear face coverings whenever you can\u2019t socially distance in New York, which explains why I didn\u2019t notice any gender differences in my own study. So I won\u2019t give up hope of a Nobel prize for science quite yet.</p> <p>The fact that a significant number of men (including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/donald-trump-mask-medical-equipment-facility-pennsylvania\">Donald Trump</a>) think masks make them look weak is yet another reminder of how damaging gender stereotypes are. The pressure to seem tough doesn\u2019t just prevent men from wearing masks, it prevents them from expressing their emotions and seeking help for mental health problems. It\u2019s one reason that men are <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190313-why-more-men-kill-themselves-than-women\">3.5 times more likely to die from suicide than women</a>.

  "<p>A decade ago, my father, Terry Lee, found a wooden sign behind our cottage\u2019s boathouse. He guessed it had once hung above the door, naming this Ontario lakeside property: Brynmorwydd. Dad, who grew up in Cardiff and emigrated to Canada in the 1970s, knew right away it was Welsh. But the cottage, which originally belonged to my stepmother\u2019s family, was actually an exercise in Canadianness for my dad, who isn\u2019t exactly handy with canoes or campfires. I don\u2019t suppose he ever anticipated that it would draw him back to Wales, but some weeks later he spotted the name of the cottage\u2019s first owner stamped on one of its beams: John G Bolt.</p> <p>He searched deeds, records, maps and censuses with the help of my uncle, and the story emerged of John Bolt, born in 1886 near Llanrhaeadr, north Wales. The son of a gamekeeper, he moved away to Cheshire at the age of eight, after his parents died. In 1927, Bolt sailed to Canada and worked on the Canadian Pacific Railway: he claimed a plot of land, built a cottage, and named it after the estate where he\u2019d been born: Brynmorwydd.</p> <p>Dad and I arrived in Llanrhaeadr-yng-Nghinmeirch in summer 2013. Fog spread over the valleys, obscuring the sheep. It had been a decade since we\u2019d holidayed together. While dad was renovating the cottage, I\u2019d been living in England. But this trip was designed to bring us together: he wanted to track down the original Brynmorwydd; I was doing a PhD in landscape history. We felt like an ideal team.</p> <p>Each day, we ventured out in search of clues: the estate no longer existed, and while some placenames remained, few buildings did. We had an 1875 OS map, which I compared with Google Maps, searching for the spot where Bolt was born.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"649141aca2baf89727a8d62b50cb32ef98dfb48f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/649141aca2baf89727a8d62b50cb32ef98dfb48f/0_114_1719_1311/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Terry Lee returns to Wales with a photo of his beloved Brynmorwydd sign.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"763\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Terry Lee returns to Wales with a photo of his beloved Brynmorwydd sign.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Terry Lee</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We stopped in the pub and chatted to the barman. \u201cA bit of an odd request,\u201d dad began, his Welsh lilt swimming into the corners of his now-Canadian accent. \u201cWe\u2019ve come from Canada, where we own a cottage by the name of Brynmorwydd \u2026\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll want to talk to the gentleman in the corner,\u201d said the barman, pointing to an elderly man eating Sunday dinner. \u201cHe grew up in the estate\u2019s main house.\u201d</p> <p>It seemed too coincidental. The man told us the land was up a narrow lane. And private. Undeterred, we drove up the winding lane to the crest of a hill. There was hardly anything there. An abandoned building, a gate, a No Trespassing sign and a wide valley view: a green quilt with hedgerow seams. Was this what John Bolt longed for? Dad pulled out a photograph of the wooden sign and posed for a picture.</p> <p>We open our cottage each year when the ice on our bay has melted. Among the teapots and old photographs, a folder entitled \u201cJohn G Bolt\u201d holds the papers we carried as we combed the countryside. On every visit, I open it to check the pages are in order, then look for my father. He may be fumbling to split logs or tidying the boathouse. Once in a while he\u2019ll rest, looking over the water that stretches before our Brynmorwydd.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.jessicajleewrites.com/\">Jessica J Lee</a> is an author and environmental historian.

  "<p>In a shameful vote this week as part of an extension of the <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/fbi-audit-exposes-widespread-abuse-patriot-act-powers\">dreaded and controversial Patriot Act</a>, the Senate <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/13/senate-browsing-histories-fisa-254970\">handed William Barr and the Trump administration</a> the ability to spy on Americans\u2019 web browsing and internet search histories without a warrant.</p> <p>The vote on a bipartisan amendment to protect this information from government surveillance sparked <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/157693/congress-may-hand-bill-barr-keys-online-life\">immediate outrage online</a> \u2013 and deservedly so. Our web browsing and search histories contain the most intimate personal information. Any administration \u2013 let alone the draconian Trump justice department \u2013 should be required to comply with the fourth amendment before trawling through it.</p> <p>Depressingly, the amendment failed to pass the 60-vote threshold by exactly one vote, 59-37, with two Democratic caucus members, including Bernie Sanders, failing to show up. \u201cAs far as I can tell we lost because there were some people absent,\u201d Ron Wyden, who co-sponsored the bill with Republication senator Steve Daines, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/13/senate-browsing-histories-fisa-254970\">told Politico</a>.</p> <p>Even worse, 10 Democrats \u2013 including Dianne Feinstein, Sheldon Whitehouse and Mark Warner \u2013 sided with Mitch McConnell and the Trump administration and voted against the provision.

A second privacy-focused amendment to the Patriot Act \u2013 one that garnered far less coverage but is potentially even more substantive \u2013 did pass overwhelmingly on Wednesday night. Because <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/13/senate-browsing-histories-fisa-254970\">the substance of the amendment was much harder to fit into a headline</a>, it received a fraction of the attention. But it may be because the vote on web browsing histories sparked immediate outrage on Twitter, politicians from both parties felt the need to accept it.</p> <p>The amendment, known as the Leahy-Lee amendment \u2013 named after its bipartisan co-sponsors Patrick Leahy and Mike Lee \u2013 reforms the secretive foreign intelligence surveillance (Fisa) court in a significant way. The Fisa court, which authorizes national security and foreign intelligence surveillance on US soil, first came to the general public\u2019s attention <a href=\"https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2013/09/snowden-fisc/\">during the Snowden disclosures</a>.</p> <p>The court, for decades, would listen to the government\u2019s side of an argument for new surveillance powers in complete secrecy, and almost never heard from the civil liberties perspective. The court was <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2013/06/13/191226106/fisa-court-appears-to-be-rubberstamp-for-government-requests\">known to rubber-stamp virtually anything the FBI or NSA asked for</a>. This one-sided system, as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/us/in-secret-court-vastly-broadens-powers-of-nsa.html\">the New York Times reported at the time</a>, carved out classified exceptions to the fourth amendment and \u201ccreated a secret body of law giving the National Security Agency the power to amass vast collections of data on Americans\u201d without the public knowing about it.</p> <p>After the Snowden disclosures, Congress was forced to create an amicus curiae \u2013 or \u201cfriend of the court\u201d \u2013 position, which at very limited times and at the court\u2019s discretion, would be allowed to resist the government\u2019s arguments. Even though the position was extremely restricted, over the past several years,<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/08/us/politics/fbi-fisa-court.html\"> it has been shown to work</a> on the few occasions it\u2019s been used.</p> <p>The Leahy-Lee amendment significantly strengthens the amicus position, giving the court\u2019s civil liberties representative much more latitude to access classified information and broadens their ability to weigh in on virtually all cases that may infringe upon the civil liberties of Americans.</p> <p>And here\u2019s where it gets interesting. The House passed a different version of a Patriot Act extension back in March, so now the Senate\u2019s version has to go back to the House, so the bills can match up. It gives privacy advocates another opportunity to get through even more robust changes, like the Wyden amendment protecting our Google search data.</p> <p>This issue is not the same partisan fight that we have become so accustomed to in Washington. Instead of a Republican-Democrat split, like so many issues in recent years, the fight over privacy and the Patriot Act has pitted a bipartisan left-right coalition against the moderate, pro-national security state establishment of both parties. Many Republicans crossed the line to vote with the majority of Democrats, while 10 Democrats sided with Barr and the Trump administration to hand them this power.</p> <p>While it\u2019s incredibly depressing Congress has failed to protect online privacy as it has become this generation\u2019s seminal issue, the fight is not over. Especially if representatives hear loud and clear how much this issue means to Americans.</p> <ul> <li><p>Trevor Timm is executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>A millionaire businessman is launching legal action against the government after it refused to disclose minutes of the Sage meetings that informed its decision to impose the coronavirus lockdown.</p> <p>Simon Dolan, who owns Jota Aviation, said he received an unsatisfactory response to his challenge over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/may/01/uk-government-faces-legal-challenge-coronavirus-lockdown-businessman-simon-dolan\">the legality of the lockdown in a \u201cletter before action\u201d sent two weeks ago</a>.</p> <p>He and his lawyers intend to go to the high court to seek permission for an urgent judicial review of the background to the lockdown imposed on 23 March.

  "<p>If I were to describe a model of how my novels are made, I would call it the big bang theory: my science is a little hazy but it\u2019s a useful metaphor. There is always a material-gathering phase, a slowly swirling mass of ideas that builds as I start reading around the topic, doing odd bits of research, writing the occasional scene \u2013 and thinking thoughts. There\u2019s a lot of thinking thoughts. This phase can sometimes last several years.</p> <p>Even when I\u2019ve started writing, I do it in a very random fashion, whatever scene might come into my head on any given morning \u2013 the dust ball is growing. Then there\u2019s a point, often quite late in the first draft, when something happens that feels like a big bang. The novel coalesces, comes into being.</p> <p>Other authors call it \u201cthe lightbulb moment\u201d, the moment when a switch is flicked and you are no longer stumbling around the landscape of your book \u2013 the vista feels illuminated at last. In the case of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/08/apple-tree-yard-doughty-review\">Apple Tree Yard</a></em>, that moment came courtesy of a police officer who was giving me a tour of the Houses of Parliament. He was a tall, friendly chap, who knew the buildings intimately and had already acquiesced to my request to see the hidden rooms, the back corridors, the disabled toilets \u2026 I had neglected to mention that I was looking for locations where a pair of lovers might have secret sex.

After showing me the gargoyles, the piles of gold-painted stacked chairs, he beckoned me to the back and opened the broom cupboard where the suffragette Emily Wilding Davison hid on the night of the 1911 census, so that she could register her abode as the Houses of Parliament at a time when women weren\u2019t even allowed to vote. The lightbulb went on. I knew I had the location for chapter one of my novel, where my main character Yvonne, a leading geneticist, has sex with a man she has only just met. A high-achieving scientist and respectable mother of two performs an act entirely motivated by the desire to do something irrational and the whole of her life spins out of control as a result.</p> <p>The police officer became a friend, and he later wrote his own novel. I hope he got his own lightbulb moment, for they are moments of great joy. All that work \u2013 all those thoughts \u2013 then you see or hear or read something that makes it all come together.

I thought that, instead of spending time on the phone, I needed time for myself. That\u2019s why I wore a jumper under the shirt \u2013 to hide that I\u2019d lost so much weight. These feelings are natural and stay with you a while. And then, at least in my case, they go away. The day you start looking at things differently, your life changes. Now I show my scars with pride.

It\u2019s not good. Now I realise that whenever I want to cry, I cry. There\u2019s no shame. And if you want to laugh, you laugh. I try not to cry in front of people that might get very emotional. I try to cry by myself. When I\u2019m in a comfortable place, I don\u2019t hold anything inside. I just let it out, and I feel better afterwards.\u201d</p> \n<p>Vialli is remarkably comfortable in this interview, even when reflecting on the closeness of death and revealing that he now faces tests every three months to check whether he is still clear of the disease. He nods in acknowledgement when I ask if his past as a footballer prevented him from expressing his emotions before cancer turned his life inside out. \u201cYes. We portrayed ourselves as tough guys that could deal with anything without showing any weakness. But I now realise the power of vulnerability and that, actually, it can be a powerful tool to get inside people\u2019s hearts. It creates empathy \u2013 and empathy is everything. I\u2019m not ashamed of saying we all cry \u2013 sometimes because we are scared. In my case I was crying because I was scared of the unknown. I did not know whether I was going to be fine or not. It\u2019s different than if you cry because you\u2019ve lost a match.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1532c5b6be63cd664965f0ac50575bd5f2362261\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1532c5b6be63cd664965f0ac50575bd5f2362261/0_0_2776_1896/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gianluca Vialli celebrates as Chelsea player-manager after victory in the 1998 Cup Winners\u2019 Cup final against Stuttgart in Stockholm\" width=\"1000\" height=\"683\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gianluca Vialli celebrates as Chelsea player-manager after victory in the 1998 Cup Winners\u2019 Cup final against Stuttgart in Stockholm.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ullstein bild via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He laughs wryly at the fleeting pain of football.

They range from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/15/42-jackie-robinson-brooklyn-dodgers-mlb\">Jackie Robinson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.donaldmcrae.com/book-in-black-white-about.php\">Jesse Owens</a> to Billie Jean King and <a href=\"https://howtheyplay.com/individual-sports/Natalie-du-Toit-First-Disabled-Athlete-who-Qualified-To-Compete-Against-Able-bodied-Athletes\">Natalie du Toit</a>, Alex Zanardi and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2016/apr/27/today-we-die-a-little-writing-the-story-of-emil-zatopek\">Emil Zatopek</a> to LeBron James and Ronda Rousey. They read even more powerfully at a time of great crisis for the world, as each story is preceded by a mantra of hope.</p> \n<p>Before we read about Zanardi, the Italian motor racing driver <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/oct/18/motorracing\">who lost both his legs after a terrible crash</a> in 2001, the quote attached to his story reads: \u201cLife is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react it.\u201d Once he had got used to his prosthetic legs Zanardi returned to Formula One as a test driver and won races in the European Touring Car series. As a Paralympic hand cyclist, Zanardi then won two gold medals at London 2012 before matching the feat four years later in Rio.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the key mantra,\u201d Vialli says. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the way we deal with situations. Alex could\u2019ve gone into a depression, but why focus on the negative? In my situation, I was shocked when I heard I had cancer. But then I thought: \u2018I\u2019ve got to make this a journey that helps me grow. I don\u2019t always see it that way, but that\u2019s my aim.\u201d</p> \n<p>The book ends with the most compelling story \u2013 as Vialli details how two bouts of cancer and chemotherapy affected him. \u201cI found out that pancreatic cancer is one of the worst cancers,\u201d he recalls. \u201cSo I was shocked, confused, helpless, hopeless. But it helped that I\u2019d been an athlete. I was used to getting injured and so with cancer I could say: \u2018Operation? When? You\u2019re discharging me? When? Then I\u2019m starting chemo? For how long?\u2019 For me it was about setting goals. I also know that nothing is permanent and it will all pass.\u201d</p> \n<p>Vialli would learn another brutal truth. Remission can be temporary. His cancer came back in March 2019. \u201cWe thought everything was going OK. And then, all of a sudden, you get a temperature. You go for a blood test and they say: \u2018Let\u2019s make sure there\u2019s nothing sinister.\u2019 I found out then. It was back.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9f5ca66ab413b5339bf5ce21884b839e137f0d5e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f5ca66ab413b5339bf5ce21884b839e137f0d5e/0_0_3543_2045/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sampdoria fans with a banner in tribute to Vialli at their game against Bologna in December 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"577\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sampdoria fans with a banner in tribute to Vialli at their game against Bologna in December 2018.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paolo Rattini/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Vialli leans closer to the screen. \u201cTo be honest,\u201d he says, \u201cI asked myself: \u2018Did you really think you were going to get away with cancer that easily?\u2019 The second time was definitely tougher because it\u2019s the cumulative effect. I wasn\u2019t so strong and there was some despair. You\u2019re thinking: \u2018Oh my God, this guy is back.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Another nine blurring months of chemotherapy passed and, in December 2019, Vialli was given fresh hope. \u201cThey call it NED,\u201d he explains. \u201cNo evidence of disease. I\u2019m perfectly aware it will take a while before I\u2019m given the all clear. Unfortunately, these things have a tendency to come back. But at the moment I am in a good place.

But he spends more time talking about gratitude. \u201cI\u2019ve learned that gratitude is a very powerful emotion. And I\u2019m very grateful to many wonderful people \u2013 my wife and family and all the people who have looked after me. They\u2019re not just competent and knowledgeable. They really feel what you\u2019re going through and there\u2019s a great deal of empathy. I\u2019m looked after at the Royal Marsden in Chelsea. It\u2019s an amazing hospital.\u201d</p> \n<p>Has it been difficult to maintain such positivity amid Covid-19? \u201cFor me it has been hard because I come <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/travel/italy-cremona-violin.html\">from Cremona</a>. It probably has the highest death rate in the region. In a way I feel I should be there with my people. I felt so bad reading that people were dying in hospital without their loved ones. It\u2019s a tragedy.</p> \n<p>\u201cStaying at home in Chelsea is not a problem. I can work remotely. I can walk to the park. My wife and daughters are here and it\u2019s great to be with them 24/7. In London I only know two people that tested positive. Thank God I have not lost anyone I know in this country. But it\u2019s different in Cremona where there are only 80,000 people. London has six million people. You feel it more in a smaller place.\u201d</p> \n<p>What does Vialli think of the Premier League <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/15/single-failed-covid-19-test-spells-quarantine-for-premier-league-squads\">trying to resume next month</a>? \u201cIn times of grief, and when you\u2019re going through a difficult situation like this, some psychologists say we should try to do things that give us pleasure without feeling guilty about it.

  "<p>Eliza Hittman does not make feelgood films. Instead, the Brooklyn-born director\u2019s work is more likely to leave you with a strange sensation in the pit of your stomach: exhilaration spiked with a heavy dose of unease. Her first two features were impressionistic, ominous pieces about unorthodox sexual awakenings, bristling with closeups of clammy limbs and anxious faces. But for her latest film, Hittman has shifted her gaze away from those adolescent encounters and towards something even more disconcerting: their potential aftermath.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/10/never-rarely-sometimes-always-review-profoundly-moving-abortion-drama-eliza-hittman-sidney-flanigan\">Never Rarely Sometimes Always</a> centres on Autumn (Sidney Flanigan, making her acting debut), a withdrawn 17-year-old with a dysfunctional home life who finds herself pregnant. Her attempt to get an abortion is a quest that takes her from Pennsylvania to the uninvitingly bright lights of New York City, a place Autumn and her cousin Skylar (Talia Ryder) must endure, penniless and exhausted, as they are shunted from clinic to bus terminal and back again. Meticulously understated and gut-punchingly sad, Never Rarely\u2026 looks as if it could be Hittman\u2019s breakthrough moment. Thanks to rave reviews, festival accolades and champions such as Moonlight director Barry Jenkins (who exec-produced the film), Oscar buzz is now steadily building (buzz that was given a major boost thanks to the Academy\u2019s decision to relax its anti-streaming rules for films whose cinema releases have been scuppered by the pandemic).</p> <p>Hittman describes her subjects as \u201ceveryday lives and everyday struggles\u201d, which, while technically true, skims over just how unsettling her films can be. Her first two features, It Felt Like Love and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/23/beach-rats-review-film-gay-coming-of-age-brooklyn\">Beach Rats</a> \u2013 about a teenage boy trying to hide his burgeoning homosexuality \u2013 were sultry and dreamily ambiguous, heavy on lingering looks and light on expository dialogue (explaining the ending of either film would be an impressive feat). Never Rarely\u2026, on the other hand, is tautly told and coldly realistic, painstakingly chronicling the hoops that Autumn jumps through in order to get an abortion. Yet the secret of its success is the story it doesn\u2019t tell: how our protagonist became pregnant in the first place.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjw_QTKr2rc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hjw_QTKr2rc?start=5&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=5\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It is a narrative chasm the viewer is left to fill with their worst suspicions: what we do know is that Autumn has been mistreated in the past and, in the absence of a clear perpetrator, everyone becomes a culprit. \u201cI was thinking about not having one antagonist but about the ways in which the world is in smaller and larger ways hostile to women,\u201d Hittman explains in her slow, deliberate way. \u201cIt\u2019s unavoidable.\u201d</p> <p>It certainly feels that way in Never Rarely\u2026, which frequently resembles a horror movie whose villain is the malign, shapeshifting spirit of the patriarchy. From a student heckler to Autumn\u2019s menacing stepfather, the creeps just keep coming: customers at the shop where Skylar and Autumn work; the girls\u2019 boss; the man masturbating in the subway car. Hittman says her decision to portray this threat as structural rather than personal reflects the lack of accountability in these scenarios \u2013 often the act of apportioning blame can feel futile. \u201cUltimately for women in this country, there\u2019s no justice that comes with accusing or confronting [abuse]. That\u2019s something I think young women are very aware of.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike her often reticent protagonists (Autumn is borderline mute for the majority of Never Rarely\u2026), Hittman is eager to talk about her work \u2013 although she does tend to demur from explanations when a solitary \u201cmm-hmm\u201d will do. When we speak she is in lockdown at home in New York, adjusting to a brave new world of endless video calling (\u201cZoom work is draining\u201d) and trying to fulfil contractual obligations while supervising young children (before we get going she must persuade her five-year-old to grant her the time to do this interview). Yet despite sounding slightly frazzled by pandemic-era parenting, she is conscientiously counting her blessings, from having a stable career (Hittman teaches full-time at the Pratt Institute, a private New York university) to being able to drive to an empty beach nearby and walk around (\u201cThat\u2019s been very restorative\u201d).</p> <p>Checking your lockdown privilege is something one feels especially inclined to do after watching her film. The plot might be set in motion by the US\u2019s complex patchwork of age-related abortion laws (Pennsylvania requires parental consent; New York doesn\u2019t), but recent events have broadened its relevance. Coronavirus-related upheaval has made getting an abortion an extremely fraught process for women who weren\u2019t faced with such restrictions in the first place (Texas and Ohio were able to suspend all abortions in March by classifying them as elective procedures), as well as intensifying the vulnerability of those who were \u2013 a situation Hittman describes as \u201ca crisis on top of a crisis\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"211ca4b672744587c958406ef79d952ad0e2eafd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/211ca4b672744587c958406ef79d952ad0e2eafd/362_0_3595_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sidney Flanigan as Autumn and Talia Ryder as Skylar in Never Rarely Sometimes Always\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sidney Flanigan as Autumn and Talia Ryder as Skylar in Never Rarely Sometimes Always.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Focus Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite its timeliness \u2013 not just in light of the pandemic, but also the Trump administration\u2019s assault on reproductive rights \u2013 Never Rarely\u2026 has been in the pipeline for nearly a decade. The film may cleave to Hittman\u2019s signature setup (grotty New York backdrop, troubled teenager front and centre) but it should be noted that she originally intended to make a completely different film, centring on an au pair in Ireland, a premise Hittman developed after learning about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/19/savita-halappanavar-abortion-midwife\">Savita Halappanavar</a>, an Indian dentist living in Galway who was denied a life-saving abortion in 2012.</p> <p>Hittman began researching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/26/ireland-has-changed-utterly-the-cruel-eighth-amendment-is-history\">Ireland\u2019s eighth amendment</a> \u2013 the recently repealed law that asserts a pregnant woman and her unborn child\u2019s equal right to life \u2013 and the voyage women seeking an abortion took across the Irish Sea to mainland Britain. \u201cSomething about that journey felt very heroic to me,\u201d says Hittman, \u201cand unrepresented on screen.\u201d But she struggled to muster up interest in the film during the Obama years, partly due to the administration\u2019s reputation for progressiveness in that area \u2013 an impression Hittman describes as an \u201cillusion\u201d.</p> <p>Yet Hittman also felt a resistance to the film on a more fundamental level. \u201cWhen I started talking about the project, a common reaction was that it felt like a topic that would be better served in a documentary,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are stigmas around representing female issues and experiences in the context of a fictional narrative film.\u201d It has to do with the skewed perspective that means women\u2019s stories tend to be othered \u2013 rendered specialist subjects \u2013 due to the prioritisation of the male gaze. \u201cDocumentaries are presenting information about topics people don\u2019t know about and that\u2019s the medium to explore \u2013 quote \u2013 <em>issues</em>,\u201d she explains. It acts as a kind of feedback loop. \u201cWomen\u2019s stories are less represented on screen so they\u2019re seen as niche.\u201d</p> <p>The mainstream\u2019s unwillingness to engage with the realities of abortion means many have no real idea of what it entails \u2013 Autumn certainly doesn\u2019t. And yet the procedure itself is not a source of horror in Never Rarely\u2026. In fact, it is almost the only thing in the film that isn\u2019t \u2013 there are no mixed feelings, only relief. What is indisputably disturbing is the sight that greets Autumn outside one of the abortion clinics: a group of chanting protesters who crowd her and Skylar, zombie-style, as they approach. Due to the pandemic, the film was only in cinemas for a few days in the US. Had it been given a full release, did Hittman think there might have been similar demonstrations? \u201cI guess we\u2019ll never know,\u201d she says merrily. </p> <p>Still, on the internet, Hittman has seen \u201cgroups of people who are anti-abortion rally messageboards to drive the rating of the film down\u201d. The review aggregator Metacritic notes the critics\u2019 rave responses, but the average user review is a dire 3.2 thanks to submissions from members of the public, who describe the film as \u201chateful and misandrist\u201d.</p> <p>Whatever methods the protesters are pushing, they can\u2019t quell the conversation Never Rarely\u2026 is prompting, or the solace it\u2019s providing. It is something Hittman attributes to film\u2019s unifying power \u2013 a phenomenon she thinks the pandemic has only intensified. \u201cThere\u2019s something beautiful about this crisis that we\u2019re all faced with,\u201d she muses, \u201cand that\u2019s people\u2019s desire all over the world to connect through cinema.\u201d</p> <p><em>Never Rarely Sometimes Always is streaming now on digital platforms</em></p>",

Broadly speaking, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/aug/18/neoliberalism-the-idea-that-changed-the-world\">neoliberalism</a> can be defined as the raft of policies and overarching political ethos that enabled governments in the late-1970s to turn away from state-directed economic planning, towards an economic model that extended competitive markets into every sphere of human activity and initiated the reign of finance capital (the kind dreamed up in the City of London and Wall Street) by removing constraints on capital mobility.</p> <p>Importantly, neoliberalism is not merely a policy agenda but also a moral framework that teaches individuals to conceive of themselves not as, say, wage earners but rather as risk-taking entrepreneurs who should expect to shoulder the financial risks of their participation in higher education, the credit system and deregulated labour markets.</p> <p>First implemented as an economic programme in the UK and the United States by the Thatcher government and the Reagan administration, its principles continued to underwrite the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/feb/10/labour.uk1\">third </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/feb/10/labour.uk1\">way</a> politics of New Labour and Clintonite Democrats. Although centre-left politicians reject the applicability of the term to their politics, a wealth of scholarship produced by economists, <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246256989_From_Thatcherism_to_New_Labour_NeoLiberalism_Workfarism_and_Labour_Market_Regulation1\">sociologists</a> and historians demonstrates how third-way politicians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/18/blair-thatcher-legacy-labour-zarah-sultana\">advanced the neoliberal project</a>.</p> <p>So, where does the ideology stand today? Some are <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/transformation/coronavirus-spells-the-end-of-the-neoliberal-era-whats-next/\">calling time</a> on the neoliberal age. In the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, <a href=\"https://paulmason.substack.com/p/day-one-of-uks-suppression-strategy?fbclid=IwAR2IZCzgpr9-gw23yDNugVaJd6tN2E2xJ_B06S_ossyCrlHCwe4SZFSBRrU\">Paul Mason declared</a> that the exigencies of the crisis would mean that, in short order, the UK\u2019s political class would soon consist entirely of either \u201centhusiastic\u201d or \u201creluctant socialists\u201d \u2013 progressive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/governments-crisis-coronavirus-business\">state intervention</a> was inevitably back on the agenda. However, claims of this sort should be treated with caution, not least because similar predictions were made following the financial crisis, and after the Brexit vote and the election of Donald Trump as US president. And those predictions turned out to be seriously awry.</p> <p>For instance, at the height of the financial crisis, the Nobel prize-winning economist <a href=\"http://16beavergroup.org/articles/2008/10/24/infoshop-the-philosophies-of-deregulation-and-neoliberalism-are-dead-in-the-west/\">Joseph Stiglitz announced</a>, \u201cNeoliberalism \u2026 is dead.\u201d Yet it soon became abundantly clear that this was premature. It is true that the crisis seemed to pose a serious threat to the veneration of markets, as governments were forced to bail out the financial sector. But, as scholars such as <a href=\"https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2018/02/neoliberalism-movement-dare-not-speak-name/\">Philip Mirowski</a> have shown, neoliberals have long understood that their project requires state intervention to create and maintain markets. Rather than thinking of the crisis-fighting of governments in 2008 as a repudiation of market-friendly policy, it\u2019s more useful to think of it as an extreme instance of pro-business government intervention that aimed to maintain the long-term primacy of the market.</p> <p>On the face of it, the vote for Brexit and the election of Trump appeared to more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/17/american-neoliberalism-cornel-west-2016-election\">plausibly represent a break</a> with neoliberalism. But that diagnosis arose from a failure to understand how neoliberalism can adaptively recombine with elements of other ideologies.</p> <p>While the Brexiteers may loathe the European Union (an institution that neoliberal intellectuals have <a href=\"https://braveneweurope.com/quinn-slobodian-and-dieter-plehwe-the-neoliberals-who-opposed-europe\">long disagreed about</a>) they remain committed to the core of neoliberal ideology. For example, the Australian points-based immigration system \u2013 so beloved by the Brexiteers \u2013 is perfectly congruent with the neoliberals\u2019 view of human beings as bundles of assets (of greater or lesser value). The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/19/the-post-brexit-immigration-plans-at-a-glance\">post-Brexit immigrant</a>\u2019s educational background, work experience and connections are redefined as forms of capital that may or may not be worth investing in (by letting them in) in order to secure a future return on that investment for the national economy. Points-based immigration systems, in other words, do not represent a straightforward shift away from neoliberal, free-market orthodoxy towards rightwing protectionism.</p> <p>If neither the crises of 2008 nor 2016 signalled the end of neoliberalism, what about Covid-19? Today, as in 2008, politicians such as Rishi Sunak have been forced to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e77d3267-21f5-4369-bf08-0cf0f31ae3ff\">implement policies</a> that seem to contradict their adherence to market supremacy, but the intention is again to do so in order to swiftly return to \u201cnormal\u201d and wean the public off their \u201caddiction\u201d to state support. The government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/rishi-sunak-to-cut-coronavirus-furlough-scheme-cq2bfxl5p\">frustrated desire</a> to curtail the furlough scheme, and the clear opposition to implementing a universal basic income, indicate a commitment to maintaining the core of neoliberal welfare policy. This means opposing generous, non-means-tested payments, which neoliberals view as detrimental to fostering entrepreneurial activity and disciplining the workforce.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/12/uk-freeze-private-rents-homelessness-coronavirus-labour\">The UK must freeze private rents now \u2013 or thousands will be made homeless | Joe Beswick</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More disturbingly, in the context of pandemic and the climate crisis, the persistence of the neoliberal view of individuals as human capital raises the possibility of governments treating populations of \u201clow value\u201d as <a href=\"https://lpeblog.org/2020/04/27/nationalism-and-neoliberal-governance/#more-3508\">disposable</a>. Increased state intervention to protect incomes is welcome, but could be used by governments to implement a kind of economic triage, with populations deemed not worth \u201cbailing out\u201d excluded from state support. As <a href=\"http://www.fordhampress.com/9780823285723/mutant-neoliberalism/\">Michel Feher</a> has shown, there are milder precedents for this in welfare reforms carried out by mainstream political parties in Ireland and Portugal, which reduced benefits for younger cohorts in order to encourage emigration and, in the case of Portugal, to swap young, relatively poor Portuguese for wealthier retirees from abroad. In a context of ballooning national debt, where migrant populations are being treated as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/02/malaysia-cites-covid-19-for-rounding-up-hundreds-of-migrants\">vectors of disease</a>, it\u2019s not difficult to see how an exclusionary neoliberal politics that supports investment in certain populations and disinvestment in others could gain traction.</p> <p>All of this is not to deny that the Covid-19 crisis poses a real threat to neoliberal orthodoxy. Physical distancing and enforced quarantine have <a href=\"https://novaramedia.com/2020/04/27/dont-fight-the-last-war-why-the-left-needs-to-look-beyond-austerity/\">disrupted the labour market</a>, potentially shifting the balance of power between labour and capital in favour of workers. The increase in <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bloomberg-law-analysis/analysis-covid-19-has-workers-striking-where-are-the-unions?fbclid=IwAR03VFO75BoVjgHGweV0x156uf4vkGlz6H1RZ8qJRDciVSzayus8pgiNoBs\">wildcat strikes</a> and the emergence of mutual aid groups are certainly encouraging. And the furlough scheme has temporarily revealed the artificiality of government spending constraints. But given the persistence and adaptability of neoliberal ideology over the past 10 years, any sober assessment of the current situation needs to be attuned to the possibility of its survival (or successful mutation), as well as its possible demise.</p> <p>\u2022 Alex Doherty is the host of the Politics Theory Other podcast</p>",

It was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/03/tiger-king-joe-exotic-netflix-tv\">commented on and memed into oblivion</a>, having the great fortune of premiering just as most of America bristled against the second week of quarantine, itching for distraction with a sense of communal catharsis. But as the weeks dragged on, and as the fantasy of \u201cwhen this is all over\u201d melted into the recognition that we aren\u2019t snapping back, that the breach from before is for many irrevocable, maybe it\u2019s time to turn to the Netflix content more suited to the moment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/03/tiger-king-joe-exotic-netflix-tv\">What happened after Netflix quarantine smash Tiger King ended?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In corona times, a dam of corrosive evidence seems to have finally given way to a <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/18/what-mutual-aid-can-do-during-a-pandemic\">mainstream understanding </a>that <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/underlying-conditions/610261/\">America is broken</a>. (Of course, many people, particularly people of color, have understood the country\u2019s brokenness for a long, long time). Much discussion in the pandemic has turned clearly and devastatingly on the wreckage of America\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/broken-capitalism\">broken capitalism</a>, which makes it perhaps ironically fitting that the country\u2019s pre-eminent streaming behemoth can offer you, in shutdown, a virtual syllabus on another of America\u2019s long-broken machines: the criminal justice system.</p> <p>I watch a lot of documentaries for my job, and while I\u2019m by no means an expert, I\u2019ve accumulated a sticky, patchy understanding of fractures, lies and unexpectedly fragile tethers in America\u2019s legal system through hanging in the Netflix true crime section. I\u2019m not talking about Netflix shock-umentaries, which are by now a genre unto themselves, in two categories: not-quite-distant retrospectives of a sensational stories (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jan/14/fyre-netflix-documentary-festival-disaster-review\">Fyre</a>, which was directed by Tiger King executive producer Chris Smith; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/15/aaron-hernandez-netflix-documentary\">Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez</a>) or outrageous, underplayed slice of America ripe for spilling out in conversation online (Tiger King; the cult of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/11/wild-wild-country-review-netflixs-take-on-the-cult-that-threatened-american-life\">Wild, Wild Country</a>; be-your-own-detective <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/16/making-a-murderer-is-our-obsession-with-true-crime-turning-nasty-serial\">Making A Murderer</a>). Those documentaries were designed to grab attention and, given Netflix\u2019s unparalleled global reach, generate word-of-mouth popularity on social media. But a second wave of programs sees Netflix\u2019s massive audience as an opportunity to redirect attention, with varying quality and impact, on larger, more entrenched outrages, which makes for an informal curriculum on America\u2019s uneven, unwieldy criminal justice system.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdvy14fdjj8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Cdvy14fdjj8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Take some docuseries that have come out just during the shutdown. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/15/the-innocence-files-shocking-netflix-series-wrongful-convictions\">The Innocence Files</a>, released last month in partnership with the Innocence Project, offers perhaps the best and most galling portrait of broken justice: six episodes about wrongful conviction in the United States, demonstrating all the ways cornerstones of conviction can go disastrously wrong. Forensic evidence, I learned, can be faulty if not outright junk science and still seal murder convictions; false or manipulated eyewitness testimony, known to be unreliable, still keeps people behind bars; prosecutorial misconduct, the justice system itself corrupted, often goes unpunished.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/11/trial-by-media-troubling-netflix-series-press-coverage-courtroom\">Trial By Media</a>, out this week, takes scattershot aim at some sensational media trials from the 1980s onward, revealing how cameras in the courtroom and a 24/7 news ecosystem turn the mercurial and corrosive court of public opinion into deeply imperfect yet influential jurors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"howtofix\">  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/X4Hk1lOGWIA\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/01/how-to-fix-a-drug-scandal-netflix-erin-lee-carr\">How to Fix a Drug Scandal</a>, a series which unfolds a house of cards in Massachusetts in the early 2010s, when the transgressions of two state chemists \u2013 one high on the job in Amherst for a decade, the other who fixed results to boost her status among colleagues in Boston \u2013 invalidated tens of thousands of drug cases in the state; cases which, the series points out, were unnecessary, draconian and disproportionately affecting poor people of color to begin with. The series, in keeping with Netflix conventions, packages a sprawling story into slick episodes designed to heighten tension by chapter, sewing together interviews, old footage and dry evidence with glossy filler footage and ride-alongs with participants. It is, in other words, a solid documentary in terms of storytelling that still, by its end, offers a lesson in an under-seen yet critical element of convictions \u2013 the expert who confirms the weight and composition of seized substances \u2013 and a system oriented toward optics over justice.</p> <p>Cyntoia Brown: Murder to Mercy is <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-murder-to-mercy-netflixs-deeply-irresponsible-cyntoia-brown-documentary/\">a problematic documentary</a> made without Brown\u2019s permission, but nonetheless traces the Tennessee courts\u2019 shocking evolution from seeing Brown as a cold-blooded murderer to scared victim of sexual assault. It conveys how unforgiving and cruel criminal trials can be; in one scene of shocking court footage, a lawyer working in Brown\u2019s defense describes her fetal alcohol syndrome so forcefully \u2013 arguing a case of damaged goods so that the court might take mercy in front of her \u2013 that she breaks down in tears.</p> <p>The newer entries build on a foundation of older, most established films or series, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/29/the-13th-review-ava-duvernay-new-york-film-festival-prisons-plantations-race-law-us\">Ava DuVernay\u2019s 13th</a> from 2016, which offered a searing indictment of America\u2019s prison-industrial complex for black people and people of color. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/04/alex-gibney-dirty-money-interview-donald-trump\">Dirty Money</a>, a series created by Alex Gibney, is less on the criminal justice system specifically but certainly indicts a country in which the 1% (including and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/08/is-jared-kushner-the-worlds-worst-real-estate-investor\">especially Jared Kushner</a>) get away with essentially whatever they want. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/mar/01/kalief-browder-spike-tv-series-criminal-justice-bronx\">Time: the Kalief Browder story</a>, a 2017 series which originally aired on Spike but is distributed by Netflix, presents a horrifying example of a shattered justice system: the story of a Bronx teen imprisoned without trial at Rikers Island for 1,000 days, often in solitary confinement, for allegedly stealing a backpack.</p> <p>Of course, Netflix is not the only provider of shows taking sharper aim at systemic issues than stereotypical true crime shock-docs; HBO recently released <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/31/the-scheme-hbo-documentary-basketball-christian-dawkins\">The Scheme</a>, nominally about money in college basketball but also about grandstanding in FBI investigations, as well as the film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/nov/19/ernie-joe-hbo-crisis-cops-police-mental-illness-health-documentary\">Ernie and Joe: Crisis Cops</a>, on training law enforcement to respond differently to mental health crises. Showtime\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/05/16-shots-laquan-mcdonald-shooting-chicago\">16 Shots</a>, on the shooting of Laquan McDonald in Chicago, came out last year. Nor do these Netflix series give a complete portrait of injustice in America \u2013 if anything, they\u2019re illustrative of how many planes of the justice system (state level, federal level, the labs testing your drugs) can fail. And I\u2019m not arguing that this does the work of investigative journalism, which undergirds many of these productions, or that the tying of entertainment with people\u2019s most crushing devastations isn\u2019t on some level always going to be ethically fraught. But you could do worse than use your streaming time to crawl through bits of a system which for many Americans \u2013 or at least many white Americans, especially white Americans on their couch in suburbia or relatively spacious apartments \u2013 can seem opaque and faraway, vaguely but not viscerally problematic.</p> <p>Remarkably, for all the scenes of brokenness, most of these shows find reasons for hope \u2013 in redemption, in persistence, in faith that even if it takes years, the truth wins out. The best ones, such as the Innocence Files, offer clear proposals for change and portraits of people fighting for them. These aren\u2019t the most meme-able or explosive lessons, but for a massive, stir-crazy streaming audience, especially these days, they\u2019re good ones to hold on to.</p>",
  "<p>This week marks my 20th anniversary in journalism, and given that there is absolutely no other news right now, I shall write about that. I am from a generation of journalists that could luck into jobs with minimal training, and by minimal I mean none. We came after the era when vocational training was a requisite, but before the 2008 crash, when media jobs were rarer than hens\u2019 teeth and salaries reduced to chicken feed. Believe me, I know how lucky I am.</p> <p>So I learned on the job, and while my innate elegance doubtless gives the impression that I picked this up as effortlessly as Audrey Hepburn learning to model in Funny Face, I was more Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator 2, trying to fit into this new world and yet blowing stuff up. But I have learned from my mistakes, and given that these include once slagging off a powerful magazine editor when said editor was standing right behind me, you can consider these lessons a masterclass from la cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me.</p> <p><strong>Lesson one: always do your prep</strong><br>I like Tom Hanks. You like Tom Hanks. We all like Tom Hanks, the nicest guy in the movie business\u2122. Who could be so awful that Tom Hanks would have to reprimand them? Hi!</p> <p>Normally, before an interview, I read up on all relevant material. But with Hanks, I got cocky: sure, sure, Forrest Gump, Big, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/sleepless-in-seattle\" title=\"\">Sleepless </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/sleepless-in-seattle\" title=\"\">In Seattle</a> \u2013 I know my Hanks! And so, with the blithe confidence of a fool, I asked him why he had never played a villain. Suddenly, all the Hanksian \u201caw shucks\u201d-ness fell away and he told me that he <em>had</em> played a villain, in the film Cloud Atlas. \u201cYou really should do your prep before an interview,\u201d he scolded me, returning to that point several times and telling me to \u201ccheck that film out\u201d. I\u2019m sorry, Tom Hanks. I never did watch Cloud Atlas and I\u2019m sorry about that, too (kinda).</p> <p><strong>Lesson two: record everything</strong><br>Early on, I was dispatched to interview Elizabeth Hurley about her swimsuit range. As this was just going to be a little thing, and about swimsuits, I thought I could get away with taking notes in my half-arsed shorthand. No chance. Hurley took a pointed glance at my notebook and placed not one but two dictaphones between us. \u201cTo be on the safe side,\u201d she said, with a dagger of a smile. Chastened, I took out my dictaphone. I never went to journalism school, but I consider myself a graduate of the Hurley and Hanks School of Journalism.</p> <p><strong>Lesson three: your boss is not your friend</strong><br>I blame the Guardian for this misapprehension, because my first boss at the paper, fashion legend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jesscartnermorley\" title=\"\">Jess Cartner-Morley</a>, is very much my friend. She tolerated more from me in my decade on the fashion desk than most therapists would accept from their patients, including finding me multiple times under my desk <em>sobbing</em> over a boy. Other bosses have been less tolerant. There was the magazine editor I wrote for so often I thought I could share my personal problems with her. A firm \u201cThis is not appropriate, Hadley\u201d corrected that. Your boss is your boss. They are not your friend. Tattoo this on the inside of your eyelids.</p> <p><strong>Lesson four: check your facts</strong><br>Back in the very early days, I interviewed an author a decade or two older than me. I unthinkingly described her hair as \u201csilver\u201d. She complained, saying her hair was brown. We went back and forth and, with the callowness of youth, I thought the whole thing a bit absurd. Fast-forward a decade or so and I spotted this author at a book festival and she was right: her hair was brown. Also, no longer being so youthful myself, I have a lot more sympathy with such details.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/11/small-talk-and-ready-made-sandwiches-things-i-dont-miss-about-normal-life\">Small talk and ready-made sandwiches: things I don't miss about normal life | Hadley Freeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Lesson five: don\u2019t bomb your office</strong><br>OK, it\u2019s finally time to tell this story. A while back, the tabloids had a running schtick in which they planted fake bombs near members of the royal family to show how badly guarded they were. A colleague came up with the wheeze that we should fake-bomb a tabloid paper, and so I made a bomb, a block of Blu-Tack stuck to a Chairman Mao alarm clock (long story). Lacking the necessary wiles, I failed to get past the security guard at the Sun; so I returned to the Guardian, put my fake bomb on my desk and went to the bathroom. When I came out, the entire office was empty. Baffled, I looked out the window \u2013 and there were all of my colleagues, outside. Someone on obituaries had heard the ticking of the Chairman Mao alarm clock and called the bomb squad. I had succeeded in fake-bombing a newspaper office: it just happened to be my own.</p> <p>Other papers were soon calling the Guardian to find out who the idiot was and, to his eternal credit, my then editor, Ian Katz, took the flak. Well, I can live on the run no more, and so I am outing myself as the actual Guardian Bomber. And this is the number one thing I have learned about journalism: you will meet the greatest people, who will always have your back, no matter how stupid you are.</p> <p>Here\u2019s to another 20 years in the job, if my poor bosses can bear it.</p>",
  "<p>Robert Ormerod had just moved house when lockdown began. \u201cWe lived in a flat before. We moved for a garden,\u201d he says. \u201cSo when this kicked off, we couldn\u2019t believe how lucky we were to have moved in time.\u201d</p> <p>As with most photographers, his ability to work has been limited, so Ormerod hit upon the idea of shooting his Edinburgh neighbours in their gardens. These outdoor spaces have been a boon for millions of families across the UK, who have over the past two months used their patch, however small, to get some fresh air, exercise, escape, grow their own food or get to know the wildlife.</p> <p>Ormerod had been using a drone for a couple of years and got his licence for a previous project, shooting crop circles. \u201cIt is perfect for now,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt allows you to stay away from people, to keep them safe. But it gives you the flexibility you would usually have as a photographer \u2013 you can move around.\u201d</p> <p>His images present an eerie juxtaposition; the apparent ordinariness of everyday life giving only the slightest clue to the horrors happening in our care homes and hospitals. \u201cThe stuff going on in the gardens is very normal, but the medium is a sign of what\u2019s happening. There\u2019s this distance between people.\u201d</p> <p>When it came to finding people to take part, Ormerod was limited by the rules of lockdown and the range of his drone. \u201cYou can\u2019t travel too far. In normal times, you might shoot in different cities, or countries, to get a cross-section of cultures. But lockdown forces you to work in the small area you have.\u201d</p> <p>He started with close neighbours and friends, \u201cpeople I\u2019ve known for years\u201d. He found others by posting online, asking friends of friends and ringing round the city\u2019s mosques. (Shabbir Hussain initially said no because he hadn\u2019t cut his grass, before managing to borrow a mower.)</p> <p>As for the gardens themselves, there\u2019s a pleasing homogeneity to them. Most of the people Ormerod photographed have a lawn; there is something very British about that. Also notable is the lack of screens as people indulge in analogue pursuits; these could almost be images from the 1950s. Seen from above, the grass acts as a canvas, Ormerod says, as well as a symbol of recreation, relaxation and domesticity. Here is a record of how his neighbours, near and far, found refuge from the storm, in the spring of 2020. </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>\u2018We have a </strong><strong>trampoline for the girls\u2019</strong></h2> <h2>Chad and Clare Hudson with Mai, seven, and Skye, five </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0b6115f61f7cbf78cbe429156fb00a786a78196e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b6115f61f7cbf78cbe429156fb00a786a78196e/346_0_5017_3013/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chad and Clare Hudson sitting at a table, while their daughters play with Hula-Hoops in their garden, and over the wall Peter and Sarah sit on a bench while their sons play in a pond\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Chad works in construction and is using the lockdown to undertake major home renovations, so the garden provides useful extra living space. \u201cWe have a little trampoline for the girls, and Hula-Hoops.

  "<p>Two years ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/25/we-were-reprobates-the-pretty-things-on-being-loved-by-bowie-and-smoking-a-spliff-with-norman-wisdom\">I interviewed Phil May and Dick Taylor of the Pretty Things</a> in the restaurant of a London hotel. Before the pair arrived, I sat chatting with the band\u2019s manager, Mark St John, a man who clearly adored his charges, but did little to underplay what hard work managing them could be. \u201cThey have a completely enveloping understanding of mayhem, with zero attention to detail, really undisciplined,\u201d he said. \u201cThey really are the most unprofessional fucking band.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s the kind of thing managers are wont to say to journalists, attempting to grub up some hype for a hot new band, to convince the writer he\u2019s about to meet ungovernable young agents of insurrection and disorder. But the Pretty Things were not a hot new band: by the time I met them, they had been going for 55 years. May was 74, Taylor 75.</p> <p>And nor was it hype: the Pretty Things really did have an enveloping understanding of mayhem, which seemed to have engulfed their career from the first moment they set foot on a stage. They had the war stories to prove it: the horror with which their defiantly snotty approach to playing R&amp;B had been greeted by the reverential denizens of the UK\u2019s early 60s blues revival; the 60s gigs that had ended in riots, or with the band being escorted out of town by the police, or, in one particularly memorable incident, being deported from New Zealand. Some former band members proved unable to cope with the unending turmoil of life in the Pretty Things \u2013 not just the riots and the unwelcome attentions of the authorities, but their penchant for creating \u201cmusical anarchy\u201d onstage and their chaotic relationship with the music business itself \u2013 and had gone mad, or simply vanished, only to resurface years later, selling life insurance.</p> <p> </p> <p>May in particular seemed to delight in being wilfully confrontational. Even before the band had begun, he had grown his hair down to his shoulders, a remarkable thing for a man in early 60s Britain to do, which led to him being spat at in the street. He had pre-empted the band\u2019s deportation from New Zealand by loudly questioning the treatment of the country\u2019s indigenous Maori population. He had not only thrown himself headlong into the psychedelic experimentation of the flower power era, he had written songs about it that were so blatant, no one could possibly miss their meaning. \u201cI need LSD,\u201d he sang, on a 1965 track called, wait for it, LSD, followed up with another track called Tripping.</p> <p>Nor was he much more circumspect about his bisexuality, swapping the gender pronouns in the band\u2019s old R&amp;B covers \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m in love with your little girl and your little boy\u2019s in love with me,\u201d he hollered on their version of Mama Keep Your Big Mouth Shut \u2013 and writing the astonishing 1967 single Defecting Grey, a song about cruising in a park while on acid. In the best possible way, Phil May genuinely didn\u2019t appear to give a fuck, and at least one member of their audience was watching very closely and picking up tips: David Bowie, a die-hard Pretty Things follower, wrote May\u2019s phone number in his address book under the name \u201cGod\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3ef46724609d69713e1e851fdc2767c0d050d78e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ef46724609d69713e1e851fdc2767c0d050d78e/0_0_2275_3506/649.jpg\" alt=\"The Pretty Things in 1973, with Phil May, front.\" width=\"649\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Pretty Things in 1973, with Phil May, front.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jorgen Angel/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Their superb early singles were, by some distance, the rawest-sounding music any British band had yet released, given an extra frisson by the sheer screw-you attitude audible in May\u2019s vocals. Take the relentless, thrilling Rosalyn, or Midnight To Six Man, a paean to the life of a jobbing musician so evocative you can almost smell the sweat and cigarette smoke.</p> <p>They were ahead of their time, descending into chaotic, free-form, feedback-laden improvisation onstage years before the Velvet Underground or the early Pink Floyd made it their trademark. In 1968\u2019s SF Sorrow, they recorded the world\u2019s first rock opera. You could say that\u2019s a dubious accolade considering some of the self-indulgent claptrap later released under that particular banner, but the album was a masterpiece, teeming with fantastic songs and fresh ideas: at turns, the music on it seems to presage both Krautrock and heavy metal. Like almost everything the Pretty Things released after their first couple of singles, it was a commercial failure \u2013 it would take decades for it to find an audience \u2013 and Taylor quit the band dispirited by a lack of success that saw them recording library music under an assumed name and appearing alongside Norman Wisdom in the disastrous sex comedy What\u2019s Good For the Goose. May claimed that, during its filming, the band had turned the veteran star onto marijuana.</p> <p>May doggedly kept going, piloting the Pretty Things through 1970\u2019s equally fantastic Parachute, one of rock\u2019s great expressions of the waning of the 60s dream: thick with harmonies, alternately beautifully bucolic and darkly paranoid and grim. For a moment, it looked like their career might take off in the US \u2013 they enjoyed the patronage of Led Zeppelin, signing to their Swan Song label \u2013 but it never quite happened, and they split up in 1976, just as punk rock suggested that the world might be coming around to the Pretty Things\u2019 original way of thinking.</p> <p>They reformed in 1978, recording the new wave-influenced Cross Talk two years later: as if to prove not much had changed in the Pretty Things\u2019 world, it flopped, but May and Taylor carried on playing live and occasionally recording with a fluctuating line-up.</p> <p>Remarkably, age did not wither them: whoever else was onstage with May and Taylor, the Pretty Things were still as incendiary live as they always had been. The difference was that they were greeted not with opprobrium, but reverence. The legend of their 60s and 70s recordings had mushroomed, and there was an entire garage-rock scene that could trace its roots back to the tough sound of Rosalyn and their early albums The Pretty Things and Get the Picture. More commercially successful peers paid homage by guesting at their shows: when they announced their retirement from electric performances \u2013 a decision influenced by May\u2019s emphysema \u2013 both Van Morrison and David Gilmour of Pink Floyd appeared onstage at their final live performance.</p> <p>A band who seemed so out-of-control on arrival that you wouldn\u2019t have bet on them lasting six months before imploding ended up lasting six decades, their reputation for mayhem and provocation always preceding them. It was a reputation of which May seemed rather proud: \u201cI don\u2019t think we were trying to be surreptitious about anything,\u201d he shrugged that afternoon, with admirable understatement.</p>",
  "<p>There was a moment, as Paul Sweeney filled out his online application for universal credit, when the reality of the box-ticking hit home. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking, Christ, when I was an MP I used to spend my days advocating for people who were caught up in all these benefits problems, and now here I am. It was bizarre.\u201d</p> <p>At the start of the year, it is fair to say that the former Scottish Labour member for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/09/glasgow-north-east-constituency-drives-its-own-regeneration\">Glasgow North East</a> had no expectation of becoming one of the 2 million people who have applied for universal credit benefits since lockdown measures were implemented.</p> <p>Early January was consumed with the joyless slog of winding up his office and constituency commitments, having lost his seat to the SNP in December\u2019s general election. After serving as an MP for only two years, 31-year-old Sweeney received two months\u2019 salary as a redundancy payment.</p> <p>Throughout the spring, he was working on Angela Rayner\u2019s campaign for UK Labour deputy, with the assumption that after that contract ended \u201cthings would come up\u201d. Instead, the special conference to announce the leadership results was cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic. Sweeney found himself at home, rediscovering Call of Duty and Rollercoaster Tycoon, the computer games he\u2019d played as a teenager, but with a growing sense of panic as the job market froze.</p> <p>\u201cI was sitting looking at my finances and thinking, after last month I\u2019ve not got any income at all. It was that moment of realisation that I don\u2019t know when this lockdown\u2019s going to end.\u201d With the mortgage on his flat in north Glasgow diminishing his remaining savings, he organised a three-month payment holiday. Suddenly, applying for universal credit became \u201clogical\u201d.</p> <p>He did so on Monday, and went on to tweet about the \u201cdisorienting experience\u201d of finding himself unemployed \u201cfor the first time since the age of 14\u201d and in the midst of a pandemic lockdown. \u201cI have completed my online application for universal credit, which was actually reasonably straightforward. Now to wait for the DWP to call me back.\u201d</p> <p>His revelation prompted a largely warm and supportive response, but with \u2013 he suggests \u2013 \u201can element of voyeurism, too\u201d. Sweeney was certainly considered a rising star at Westminster, reclaiming a cherished Glasgow seat from the nationalists and joining Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s cabinet as the shadow minister for Scotland a month after his election. He was known for his effective and energetic campaigns on behalf of constituents, alongside his boundless enthusiasm for the city\u2019s Victorian architecture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6dd6da129df723d74192457821857aee116abe1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6dd6da129df723d74192457821857aee116abe1/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Sweeney at Possilpoint community centre, where he volunteers at a food bank.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Sweeney at Possilpoint community centre, where he volunteers at a food bank.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI just thought I\u2019d put it out there,\u201d he reflects. \u201cI\u2019m one of these people that\u2019s been long advocating for a basic income, so why is there any shame in accessing public funds that are used to support people?</p> <p>\u201cA few people have said, \u2018Oh I\u2019d never apply because I\u2019m too proud\u2019, that slightly Calvinist idea about welfare, that it\u2019s somehow morally questionable. I just felt I\u2019m going to make a point here because you\u2019re never too far from being in that situation.\u201d</p> <p>There was an assumption, Sweeney contends, that because he arrived in the Commons well-spoken and better-presented, his background must be one of privilege. \u201cI always found it irritating, having represented the constituency I was born and brought up in, that there was this inference I wasn\u2019t a legitimate representative of it.\u201d</p> <p>Sweeney grew up in the heart of a constituency where there are nearly double the Scottish average of children living in poverty. His father worked in the Clyde shipyards, but was made redundant in the 90s and now drives a taxi. His mother has worked as a bank teller all her life. His first job was an Evening Times paper round while he was still at school and \u2013 the only person in his family to go to university \u2013 he worked part-time throughout his studies, before he joined BAE Systems\u2019 graduate development programme, becoming a production engineer at its Govan shipyard.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality is, the majority of Scots are working class \u2013 if they stopped earning a salary, within two months they\u2019d be in financial difficulties. However prestigious or seemingly privileged you are in terms of your work or identity, you\u2019re never far away from that. If more of us realised how close we are to that peril, maybe the social security system wouldn\u2019t be so punitive.\u201d</p> <p>While he waits for his claim to be assessed, he is clear that \u201c\u00a3340 a month a ridiculously small amount of money\u201d, but adds: \u201cIt\u2019s a comforting feeling to have something coming in as you find a way through this. It\u2019s not something you can sit back and relax on, but it takes the edge off.\u201d</p> <p>For now, Sweeney has been helping out with deliveries for a local food bank: \u201cIt\u2019s good psychologically to stay moving rather than dwelling on things.\u201d But he also admits that \u201cin a strange way I\u2019ve been enjoying time to relax\u201d.</p> <p>He says: \u201cBeing elected in 2017 unexpectedly, with a 200 majority and a parliament that could have collapsed at any moment, it was like having a ticking bomb in your hand. It was a pressure cooker from the start.\u201d</p> <p>The double blow of losing his seat \u2013 an experience he describes as brutal \u2013 and finding himself unemployed in lockdown is plain, and his impatience to get back to politics fizzes through his conversation. \u201cIt is frustrating to be sitting here knowing that my future is elsewhere.\u201d</p> <p>Sweeney is not a maudlin sort, but he will allow that his mum, who has only recently recovered from coronavirus herself, is \u201ca bit upset by it all\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably hit her harder emotionally than me. It is what it is; it\u2019s shit, but I\u2019m not dead, you know?\u201d He laughs, evidently still confounded at his present circumstances, personal and global. \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to get on with it.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>You don\u2019t need to tell Claire McArdle how quickly sports media are changing. When she joined Otro in 2018 it was in the role of chief content officer, working at a social network with a very exclusive membership. Leo Messi, Neymar, Paulo Dybala, Dele Alli, David Beckham and Zinedine Zidane; it seemed as if every big name in world football had signed up to Otro. The stars were to share exclusive insights into their lives on a regular basis and all you had to do to see it was pay $3.99 (\u00a33.30) a month.</p> <p>Two years later, however, and you can keep your wallet in your pocket. \u201cBetween the conception of the idea and coming on to market, the industry moved on at quite a considerable pace,\u201d is how McArdle puts it. Now Otro\u2019s managing director is responsible for what you might call a pivot in the business. The subscription model has been ditched and Otro has become a studio, working to tell stories in conjunction with broadcasters and digital platforms, albeit still with the same big names. \u201cWe were going into market with a niche service, and that market had changed,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat we had to look at quickly was ... what was the best way to deliver what we intended to deliver from the start?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/26/premier-league-football-will-survive-lockdown-coronavirus-gyms-leisure-centres-basketball\">Premier League will survive lockdown \u2013 it's the rest of sport we should worry about | Sean Ingle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some might say that expecting people to pay for videos about Alli\u2019s tattoos or the personal thoughts of Messi was always going to be a stretch. But McArdle is not wrong to observe that Otro came about just as media were being turned upside down. Streaming platforms such as Amazon and Netflix had become dominant, with their seemingly endless libraries meaning viewers never had to leave. Then there was Instagram Stories, a service perfect for stars who want publicity but on their own terms. \u201cIt gave sports talent the ability to have that reach and immediate contact with their fans,\u201d McArdle says of Stories, \u201cbut there was an element of control there, because everything is gone within 24 hours.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You can't do normal things.

She won\u2019t talk about what kind of deals Otro has with its players, nor will she share specifics on upcoming projects, but that is probably sensible given that Covid-19 has thrown everything up in the air for all kind of filmmakers. \u201cWe\u2019re in a moment when you can\u2019t do the normal things,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re in production on something right now and really having to innovate; we\u2019re essentially producing a show when no one is in the same room.\u201d</p> <p>What she can talk about, however, and engagingly, is the industry Otro is now in: sports media for when there isn\u2019t any sport on. She\u2019s a big fan of \u201cfollow docs\u201d, the industry term for inside-the-dressing-room documentaries such as Sunderland Till I Die and All Or Nothing: Manchester City. She says they gratify a fan\u2019s basic desire to know what goes on in an athlete\u2019s life beyond the matches they play. At the same time, they only work when they\u2019re also good TV.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94af222d14d5c607ed1f746c9160e79a53a26677\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94af222d14d5c607ed1f746c9160e79a53a26677/243_68_2917_1750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zinedine Zidane, the Real Madrid manager, at a game\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zinedine Zidane signed up to Otro, along with Neymar, Paulo Dybala and Dele Alli.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Potts/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere has to be a narrative, you have to have the characters to drive it,\u201d McArdle says. \u201cBrandon, the kit guy in All or Nothing, is a great example, how he acts as a glue between all the players.

You can\u2019t get away with just using a big team, you have to apply creative rigour.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s the requirement for a good story that means McArdle, a former producer at Channel 4, is relaxed about the sort of arrangements in which stars have to give their approval on documentaries made about them. \u201cI think there were things in All or Nothing that, when I sat there with a producer\u2019s hat on, I thought: \u2018OK, they left that in, that\u2019s interesting,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThe onus is on you as the producer to have the conversation as to why it\u2019s important that a story is told in a certain way.

It\u2019s a Venn diagram of something that\u2019s entertaining and something that feels authentic enough that the protagonist themselves wants to be involved in.\u201d</p> <p>Authenticity is a quality the original Otro sought to trade in and, while the attempt didn\u2019t work, it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t an appetite for it. McArdle notes that authenticity is driving another growing trend in sports broadcasting. That\u2019s the mediated match-day experience, where you watch the game in the (remote) company of someone you trust. Examples include BT Sport\u2019s Champions League Goals Show, or the \u201cco-viewing\u201d experience of Eleven Sports\u2019 Watch Together feature, where you log on to a broadcast with friends; a cross between watching the match and doing a Zoom call.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s going to be more co-viewing in the next few years, the appetite is there,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd if it isn\u2019t done by broadcasters, people will find a way to do it on another platform. Because it is a bit rubbish when you watch football on your own.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>More than half of pregnant women who were admitted to hospital with coronavirus in the UK were from a black and minority ethnic background, a study has found, prompting experts to issue guidance for midwives to remain on high alert and lower the threshold for diagnosis by medical professionals.</p> \n<p>The study found that 55% of pregnant women admitted to hospital with coronavirus from 1 March to 14 April were from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/equality-watchdog-urged-investigate-impact-on-bame-people-london-mayor\">BAME background</a>.

The study follows findings from an inquiry published last year, which showed that <a href=\"https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/downloads/files/mbrrace-uk/reports/MBRRACE-UK%20Maternal%20Report%202018%20-%20Web%20Version.pdf\">black women were five times more likely to die</a> from complications surrounding pregnancy and childbirth than white women, while Asian women were twice as likely to die.</p> \n<p>The RCM has also launched a targeted campaign to raise awareness of the increased risk to BAME women and reassure pregnant mothers that help is available.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve known for some time that there are big disparities in maternal health according to ethnicity,\u201d Prof Marian Knight, the lead researcher of the study at Oxford University, said, \u201cbut what is surprising is the extent of the imbalance. More than half of the women who were admitted with Covid-19 in pregnancy were from BAME group, which is very different from the whole birth population as whole.\u201d</p> \n<p>Knight explained that when the study took into account whether women had other medical problems, were older, or overweight, the racial disparities remained. The racial difference still showed up when researchers excluded data from women who were from London, the West Midlands, and the north-west, where rates of coronavirus are higher.</p> \n<p>The study analysed data of 427 pregnant women and has not yet been peer-reviewed.</p> \n<p>The findings showed that about one in 10 pregnant women admitted to hospital in the UK with coronavirus required respiratory support in a critical care setting, a figure reflective of the general population. One in 20 of the babies born to mothers admitted to hospital subsequently had a positive test for Covid-19; of these, half had infection diagnosed on samples taken less than 12 hours after birth.</p> \n<p>Overall, five women who were admitted and had a positive test for coronavirus had died. The deaths include Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/pregnant-healthcare-workers-pressured-into-covid-19-frontline\">a 28-year-old pregnant nurse close to full term</a>.

There were lots of discounts going on before the lockdown and there are discounts going online now.\u201d</p> <p>She suggested that brands such as Ted Baker and Moss Bros might face a particular challenge because they were focused on smart clothing for events and office wear which are now far less in demand as many people work from home and weddings are cancelled.</p> <p>John Lewis is poised to launch another round of fashion discounts in the coming days even though the department store chain has only just finished a 30%-off deal.

It is how you reopen and pay all your bills. If 25% of fashion retailers were in turmoil before [coronavirus], it has got to be 60%-70% now. At the time we locked down, fashion businesses had just stocked up. If you have got some good stuff, you can box it up, but not if you need the cash to pay your suppliers.

From the Iran nuclear deal to the Trans Pacific Partnership, from environmental regulations to the Affordable Care Act, Trump has always seemed to be on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/11/donald-trump-barack-obama-legacy\">a mission to erase his predecessor\u2019s legacy.</a> With few deep convictions of his own, Trump found a negative reference point in Obama.

  "<p>It\u2019s the spring of 1960, and 18-year-old Erica has come to the tiny Greek island of Hydra with her boyfriend Jimmy, a would-be painter-poet, to join its foreign colony of writers, artists and musicians. Erica is running away from her controlling father in Bayswater and the risk of becoming nothing more than his housekeeper, like her late mother. \u201cIt was unbearable really,\u201d thinks Erica, what her mother \u201cput into a life that wouldn\u2019t contain her\u201d. Hydra\u2019s \u201cfantastically blue water and cheap rent\u201d, \u201csalt-white houses\u201d and wacky creatives promise freedom from all bourgeois restrictions.</p> <p>Erica immediately falls under the spell of Charmian Clift, a charismatic Australian with a ramshackle villa, writer husband and clutch of semi-feral children. Though Clift\u2019s name sounds as if it might have been invented by Samson to capture the seductive spirit of the counterculture, she, like almost everyone on the island apart from Erica and Jimmy, is based on a real person. There\u2019s Clift\u2019s husband, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/21/george-johnstons-majesties-of-nature-and-monstrosities-of-man-is-my-sydney\">George Johnston</a>; the New York playwright Kenneth Foch; the Beat poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/jan/20/guardianobituaries.books1\">Gregory Corso</a>; and the emerging Scandinavian novelist Axel Jensen, whose long-suffering wife <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/07/so-long-marianne-leonard-cohen-writes-to-muse-just-before-her-death\">Marianne </a>turns a blind eye to his affairs while she looks after their baby. Clift<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/30/bohemian-tragedy-leonard-cohen-and-the-curse-of-hydra\"> is a writer herself</a>, author <em>of Peel Me a Lotus</em>, a memoir of her family\u2019s Aegean escape from \u201cthe rat race\u201d, though her days are now taken up with shopping and cooking thrifty meals when she\u2019s not coaxing George to work.</p> <p>Most seductively of all, there\u2019s 25-year-old Leonard, the soulful Canadian who arrives on Hydra with his guitar and moves in with Marianne after Axel abandons her for another woman. As a character Leonard is elusive. He\u2019s romantic, chivalrous and slippery, offering a lot but not delivering much, and given to aphoristic word salads. \u201cWhen it comes down to it, all subjects are just an allegory, a metaphor for human experience\u201d and \u201cIf we assume the role of melancholy too enthusiastically, we lose a great deal of life\u201d are typically airy Leonardisms. He spends his time bedding Marianne, popping amphetamines and bashing out the book that will eventually appear as <em>The Favourite Game</em>. He\u2019s already published a volume of poetry and is about to burst on to the world stage as a singer and songwriter. He is, of course, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/leonard-cohen\">Leonard Cohen</a>, and Marianne is Marianne Ihlen, the Norwegian beauty who became, for the decade of their on-off relationship, his muse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d3d1ac5b9d6332a421aeaabb17578044d43de5c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3d1ac5b9d6332a421aeaabb17578044d43de5c8/219_791_3172_4330/733.jpg\" alt=\"Disenchanted isle (from left) George Johnston, Charmian Clift, Jason Johnston, Marianne Ihlen and Leonard Cohen, Hydra, 1960.\" width=\"733\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Disenchanted isle (from left) George Johnston, Charmian Clift, Jason Johnston, Marianne Ihlen and Leonard Cohen, Hydra, 1960.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Burke/The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Marianne, \u201cbeautifully trained by Axel in the arts that facilitate good writing\u201d, is soon keeping house for Cohen as she once did for Axel, ensuring he always has \u201ca gardenia and a little sandwich\u201d on his writing table. She\u2019s a younger and still hopeful incarnation of the worn-out Charmian, just as Erica, in thrall to her Jimmy, is an apprentice version of the domestic goddess that is Marianne. Erica is too busy going to market and whipping up moussaka to pursue her own creative work: \u201cJimmy\u2019s been so inspired,\u201d she explains, \u201cand it\u2019s so often my turn to sort out a meal.\u201d As Charmian says wryly, \u201cWhere would these male writers be without their ministering angels?\u201d</p> <p>The Jimmys and Georges and Leonards are far better than Erica\u2019s father at concealing how ruthlessly they exploit their women, but the latter end up just as confined and broken as Erica\u2019s mother. Hydra itself is an illusion, its heady mix of male freeloaders, free-flowing retsina and freer love concealing a reality of unfulfilled female ambition, sexual betrayal, poverty and alcoholism. Samson captures both the dream and the disappointment in a frictionless prose that slips down easily. Sometimes she herself seems to fall for the myth she\u2019s setting out to expose: there are strumming bouzouki players and grumpy donkeys and scented jasmine around every sun-baked corner; two nubile girls look up \u201clike startled does\u201d, while Charmian has eyes of \u201cburning absinthe\u201d. And it\u2019s hard not to do an anatomical double-take when we\u2019re told that after a season on Hydra Jimmy\u2019s shoulders \u201care almost amphibian from swimming\u201d. Are they <em>green</em>? Warty? Or is Samson hinting that, like most of the princes in this theatre of dreamers, he\u2019ll turn out to be a frog?</p> <p>Even Leonard (no spoilers here) emerges as a bit of a bastard, doomed to be discontented with Marianne no matter how many sandwiches she makes. We\u2019re never entirely sure what his motivations are for dumping her, but then, no doubt the real-life Ihlen wasn\u2019t sure either. All in all, Samson is magnificently in control of her subject. If this beguiling, clever book has a moral it\u2019s that being a muse isn\u2019t all that amusing, and that, as Charmian puts it, \u201cyou should be very cautious of pinning all your dreams to a bloke, however talented and marvellous he may be\u201d. </p> <p>\u2022 <em>A Theatre for Dreamers is published by Bloomsbury Circus (RRP \u00a314.99).</em></p>",

In the midst of a pandemic, it becomes surreal. In early March, as the world shut down, I imagined my scheduled treatment would be postponed, but to my amazement the clinic said it would proceed. And so one Saturday afternoon, as the virus gathered pace and airports acquired a new and fearful mood, I took one of the last flights from London to Heraklion. I was making this trip alone; my local health authority does not treat single women.</p> <p>With its own health system buckled by years of austerity, the Greek government had moved quickly to prevent a coronavirus outbreak of the magnitude of those in Italy or Spain. The evening I arrived, 14 March, Greece was on its way to lockdown, and Heraklion\u2019s shops, bars and restaurants stood newly shuttered.

There is no room for tourists now. The swingers\u2019 festival has been cancelled; the beaches have closed. They will introduce a mandatory quarantine for new arrivals, close the hotels and the parks. I retreat to the apartment. That night I lie awake, listening to the wind and the cats yowling in the darkness.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I hear IVF clinics around the world are closing, treatments being postponed indefinitely, and am filled with gratitude</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The clinic is a large, grey, modern building not far from the port. It takes 20 minutes to walk there in the rain, a fierce wind whipping in off the water. At the reception desk, I am told to stand behind a line as they fire a thermometer gun at my head, then permit me to ring the fertility centre doorbell. I fold the sleeve of my jumper over my thumb to press the buzzer.</p> <p>I will admit that I have not read up extensively on IVF. I have taken a strictly need-to-know approach, avoiding online message boards and support groups, spurning offers to bond with friends-of-friends over their own experiences. Each person is different, I have argued, each body is different. Still, as I stand waiting at the door, I realise that this means I have little idea of what to expect.</p> <p>A foreign clinic is disorienting when you are accustomed to another medical system: the rhythms are subtly different, the smells, the light all wrong. I notice the cigarette smoke on the senior nurse\u2019s breath, the junior who chews gum behind her mask as she draws my blood. Even the tourniquet strapped around my arm feels flimsier than back home. \u201cTake a breath,\u201d the nurse says solemnly, as she inserts the needle. She leaves a small trail of blood along my skin, then dispenses the contents of the large syringe into several containers; a spring-like gurgling sound that I find oddly hopeful.</p> <p>I walk home along the backstreets, past ageing stucco apartments and the sound of a couple arguing through an open window. When you are not familiar with a culture or a language, your senses become heightened \u2013 the colours louder, the sounds and scents more pronounced. I try to notice the details: the hover of wasps over the bowls of water left out for street cats. A snail on a bright blue wall. The firebug on an orange tree. It stops my mind from spiralling. I stop by the supermarket, where they are already limiting the number of customers, and plastic gloves are mandatory. But the shelves are full and no one is stockpiling.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I am used to sitting in doctors\u2019 offices receiving bad news. I know that the grief will come later</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The following day, I return to the clinic. My blood test results have proved heartening and my consultant tells me he hopes for 15 or 16 eggs. He chatters warmly as he performs my ultrasound: about his time living in London in the days of disco, the fact that English women never cook. \u201cI like to cook,\u201d I tell him. \u201cWhat do you cook? Sandwiches?\u201d he asks, then reels off the measurements of my ovaries to his assistant. When I leave, the senior nurse gives me a face mask, ties it tightly so that it covers my nose, and rubs my back with a kind of tenderness. \u201cIt\u2019s for you,\u201d she says. \u201cMake sure you wear it.\u201d</p> <p>There is little new I can tell you about IVF medication. The basic protocol is to stimulate the ovaries to produce eggs, which are then removed, fertilised and returned; a further array of drugs help make the pregnancy sustainable. And so for the weeks to come my days are measured out in injections, pills and pessaries, in the fiddliness of mixing powders and solutions, of needles and small glass vials. Soon my stomach is puffy and bruised; my body feels distorted and misshapen.</p> <p>Meanwhile, I follow news of the pandemic on my laptop. I look at graphs and statistics. I listen to the BBC. Mostly I watch the UK with horror: its slow route to lockdown, the mad rush at the supermarkets, the people who flock to pubs and parks and jostle over toilet roll. There is none of that here. Rather, people move with a kind of quiet obedience. When my flight home is cancelled, I feel something like relief. I feel safe here.</p> <p>On 23 March, Greece grounds all flights to the UK and docks all boats to the islands. I can now only leave the house for an hour each day: to buy groceries, seek medical treatment or take exercise, and must first text the government for permission. A strange serenity settles over these days of confinement: I sleep well and long, read, work, take afternoon walks down to the waterfront. I do not return phone calls from well-meaning friends; texts and emails go unanswered. I feel beholden to nothing besides my own body, feed it yoghurt and oranges and sesame snaps. One day I read that IVF clinics around the world are closing, that treatments are being postponed indefinitely, and am filled with a great swell of gratefulness.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I have a talent for choosing unsupportive men who will find commitments more pressing than helping you through a miscarriage</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When I return to the clinic for my second ultrasound, my consultant is in a less jovial mood. He scowls slightly, as if I have disappointed him, tells me the ovarian stimulation has not been as successful as expected; he now hopes for five eggs.</p> <p>I am accustomed to sitting in doctors\u2019 offices receiving bad news. To be told repeatedly that you have lost your baby, that there is nothing they can do, that your identical twins have no heartbeat, develops a kind of composure. I have learned how to imperceptibly bite my lip, and close my eyes, and know that the grief will come later, far from here, when it will be solitary and wild and flailing.</p> <p>That I have done all of this alone is testament to what my friends call my terrible taste in men. I have a particular talent for choosing unsupportive partners, men who will ask you to choose between your baby and them, who will miss hospital appointments, and find commitments more pressing than helping you through a miscarriage.</p> <p>Last summer, I sat in my GP\u2019s surgery and told her I wanted to pursue solo IVF. I pressed my fingernails into my palm to steady myself as I spoke. She was supportive and kind, and made a referral to the fertility department at the local hospital.</p> <p>I was not technically single at the time, but two weeks later I left my boyfriend of four years. Some months earlier I had learned that he had cheated on me, constantly, for the entirety of our relationship, including while I was pregnant. I had loved him more than I had loved anybody, and perhaps this was the reason I had tried to make things work, but the days had soon settled into a kind of mute despair.</p> <p>It was liberating to feel in charge of my own destiny again, and for the three months while I waited for my first appointment with the fertility clinic, I felt thrillingly alive. When it came, that appointment was dispiriting: the nurse explained my local health authority\u2019s policy on treating single women. She was sympathetic, ordered a range of fertility tests, cautioned against using a donor I knew, and suggested I look at clinics abroad. \u201cGreece,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have some good clinics there.\u201d</p> <p>There followed several months of waiting \u2013 for test results, for a round of MMR vaccinations (my GP had no record of my ever having had them). The new year turned and it was almost spring. I told the clinic in Heraklion, chosen for its impressive success rates and peaceful location, that I would come in March. I had not heard of coronavirus then, though already in China the disease was spreading. It seemed very far away. I focused instead on the small, steady world I had created, of fertility acupuncture, sobriety and sperm selection.</p> <p>It is easy to get lost in the process of choosing a sperm donor, to dwell upon academic qualifications, professions, favourite pastimes. The more you pay, the more you know: baby photos, adult photos, voice notes, family medical histories. Some cryobanks will supply handwriting samples and outline drawings of your donor\u2019s face in profile; this can have the strange effect of making everyone look like a criminal.</p> <p>Above all, I decided, let him be kind. From hundreds of donors, I whittled it down to two: the mechanical engineering student whose profile was somewhat restrained, but about whom the staff appraisal spoke glowingly; and a Danish musician with wavy hair who talked about his love of nature and art. \u201cHe sounds like the kind of man I would date,\u201d I told my friends. This was not necessarily a good thing, they pointed out. That night I lay in bed and imagined their profiles being read in the voices of my very worst boyfriends. I chose the engineer.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Friday morning, the day of my egg retrieval, and the donor sperm has not arrived. The courier office can tell me only that it has left Athens. I take the coast road to the clinic, walk slowly through the uncertain morning, and try not to think about the catastrophe before me. The air is sweet and soft, the sea a searing blue. I am watching the light play on the waves when, just beyond the port, I see the daily cargo boat approaching the shore, bringing supplies from the mainland: food and medicine and a nitrogen tank of donor sperm.</p> <p>In the days that follow, I like to think of my eggs in the laboratory, cells dividing, happily gathering into blastocysts. It makes me feel less alone. I await news from the embryologist, sleeping, eating, taking long walks. One morning, I wake to a ruffling sound beyond my bedroom curtains. It is a bird, I think, that has flown into my courtyard. But when I look I find it is rain: heavy, plump drops on the corrugated iron roof and the broad leaves of the potted plants. That day the embryologist calls: transfer will be in two days\u2019 time.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I sat in a room that smelled of disinfectant. There was no one\u2019s hand to hold, no love in the room</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another flight is cancelled. Getting home will now take some 42 hours, several changes of plane, and hundreds of pounds. \u201cDo I need to come and rescue you?\u201d an ex-boyfriend emails. I tell him he should know by now that I am not someone who takes well to rescuing. Perhaps if I did, I would not be here doing IVF alone in a foreign country in the first place.</p> <p>I am worried about the pigeons. The square outside the cathedral, in normal times surrounded by busy restaurants, lies quiet; deprived of their usual scraps, the birds seem bewildered. They flock near the cathedral steps, as if hoping for mercy. I take to feeding them: crusts of bread and old kalitsounia that brings them flocking around my ankles, burbling and fluttering as they eat. I feed the cats, too, their thin little bodies winding against my calves.</p> <p>I am the only patient at the clinic on the morning of my embryo transfer. The number of treatments is dwindling as no one can travel and there is too much uncertainty. My consultant, the junior nurse, the embryologist and I gather in the operating theatre. The embryologist plays Mozart through her phone to drown out the whirr of the generator. It is a simple procedure \u2013 the embryo being transferred to the womb via a catheter. \u201cThere!\u201d the consultant says. On the screen I watch a small dot make its way across the darkness and then settle.</p> <p>For the next two weeks it will become the pale white dot upon which I live. I think about my tiny speck of hope as I follow the growing bleakness of the world: nurses in London wearing bin bags and scuba masks, the want of ventilators in New York City, the death toll in Italy that rises and rises. I try not to think about how I will get home, about the potential dangers of travelling across a continent, newly pregnant, in a pandemic.</p> <p>In my isolation chamber I feel like a Russian doll, inside me another smaller me, confined in her own small isolation. I have been pregnant enough times that this state feels familiar: all-engulfing, electric. And yet I have miscarried enough to know that nothing is certain. I have often thought that the two-week wait between conception and pregnancy test is like being alone in a strange house: every sound, every shadow, can convince you that someone is there.</p> <p>For a week I feel truly pregnant. And then suddenly I do not. One day I wake to feel a tangible distance between the synthetic hormones and my own body. I do not tell anyone. Instead I walk down to the water, stay out far beyond the mandated hour. I marvel at the flicker of tiny fish moving between the boats in the harbour. I look at the bright yellow tangle of fishing nets, the deep pink of wooden shutters, the distant mountains, snow-peaked against the bluest sky.</p> <p>I walk on beside the sea, past young couples, hands entwined, and think of how clinical and lustless the IVF process is. Of how a week ago I sat in a room that smelled of disinfectant, wearing a thin blue gown and a surgical mask. How there was no one\u2019s hand to hold, no love in the room. In the streets outside, spring had begun. There was the smell of orange blossom, and violet carpenter bees danced between branches. I stared up at the voluminous petals of bright red flowers, at stamen and pollen and anther and stalk, and thought that this was how reproduction ought to be: stickiness and scent, warmth and desire, all the senses colliding at once.</p> <p>On the day I get a negative pregnancy test, 717 people die of coronavirus in the UK. For a long while, I sit on the edge of my bed and try to balance rationality and sorrow. I look at pictures from Italian hospitals, follow the upward curves of the latest graphs. Friends have lost loved ones, I tell myself; I have lost someone who barely ever existed. And yet I walk out into the cool sun of my courtyard and cry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/18/babysitting-embryo-carry-child-for-friend-surrogacy\">\u2018She said she\u2019d be babysitting our embryo\u2019: what\u2019s it like to carry a child for a friend?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some years ago, the writer India Knight published a self-help book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/01/in-your-prime-older-wiser-happier-india-knight-review\" title=\"\">In Your Prime</a>, in which she discussed the way that in adulthood our lives diverge into two camps: the have-children and the have-nots.

As my friends have paired off and become parents, I have seen them less, travelled more, grown quieter. I cannot hope to understand the dramatic shifts and expansions in their lives, just as they are unlikely to understand the reduction of my own.</p> <p>And as the weeks of lockdown rolled on, that phrase has returned to me anew; I came to think how all our lives have grown small and unpeopled. How we have come to find pleasure in the minutiae: the slow drift of days, the unfurling of blossom, a street filled with clapping on a warm spring evening. And sometimes, too, when all seems lost, a small patch of blue sky above a courtyard in Greece.</p>",
  "<p>I withdrew \u00a3200 from an ATM in mid-March \u2013 and I still have \u00a3160 left collecting dust in my wallet. Even one of the last reasons to keep a stock of coins in my car has gone, because the local supermarket has unchained the trolleys that previously needed a \u00a31 coin. Coronavirus is wiping out cash in the UK, and it will probably never return.</p> <p>Should we be bothered? Maybe. On my trip to the supermarket on Monday I also saw a lonely, frail and nervous gentleman, who looked to be in at least his 80s, taking cash out of the ATM. He probably shouldn\u2019t have been out, but clearly this was something he felt he really had to do. Never has there been a bigger gap between those of us who are abandoning cash, and those who still see it as crucial to their life.</p> <p>The Age UK boss, Caroline Abrahams, says it\u2019s deeply worrying that some older people are telling the charity that their cash supplies have run out and they are worried about how they will pay for their shopping.</p> <p>The good news is that the elderly gentleman I saw bent double over that ATM may not need to go back, if someone lets him and others like him know that the Post Office, and some banks, may deliver cash to their door.</p> <p>If you have a Post Office card account and are deemed vulnerable, that can be as much as \u00a32,500. NatWest, Barclays and Tesco Bank will also deliver to your door if you are a vulnerable customer.</p> <p>NatWest will generate a code over the phone for those over 70 to give to a friend or neighbour so they can withdraw an agreed amount from an ATM within the following three hours.</p> <p>But let\u2019s not fetishise cash usage. It\u2019s striking how many older people have switched to online banking and contactless payments since the lockdown began. Halifax says the numbers of over-65s signing up for online banking has jumped by 63%, and their use of contactless has also soared.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the increase in the UK of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/mar/24/limit-for-contactless-spending-to-rise-to-45-at-beginning-of-april\">contactless limit to \u00a345 </a>at the start of April has made cash all but redundant for most. Either tap-and-go, or tap in four numbers for spending above \u00a345. Why bother to use an ATM, which will soon become a curiosity, a bit like a BT phone box. Around 250 disappear every month from our streets and malls, and not that many people even notice.</p> <p>A cashless society is cheaper (it costs billions every year to distribute notes), more honest (no more tax cheating from cash-in-hand payments) and safer (not much for muggers to steal or for drug dealers to do business in). Above all, for smartphone-wielding millennials, it\u2019s just far more convenient.</p> <p>The drawbacks? Bad news for everyone from buskers to beggars to churches that rely on cash donations. More importantly, some people will lose track of their spending, unable to budget wisely. Society\u2019s most marginalised, those not formally within the banking systems, could almost become non-persons.</p> <p>The banks love the switch to a cashless society, which should be a cause for concern in itself. A handful of giant players, such as Visa and Mastercard, will control the entire payments infrastructure \u2013 until one or both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jun/01/visa-card-network-crashes-and-sparks-payment-chaos\">fall over</a>, which even if it is only temporary, has the potential to freeze the entire financial system.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the \u201cbig brother\u201d implications of having every penny of our spending logged and traceable.</p> <p>These drawbacks sound worse than the benefits, but they will be largely ignored as the convenience of contactless wins out. And as any millennial will tell you, budgeting is actually much better using the tools of an app rather than relying on the purse strings.</p> <p>Coronavirus is simply hastening the inevitable end of cash and coins. There was an enormous hullabaloo when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/apr/14/abolition-cheques-reconsidered-payments-council\">the banks set a date for withdrawing cheques</a>, and they hurriedly backtracked. Quite rightly, they put in place measures to ensure that those who really needed to use them could still do so.</p> <p>We need similar measures to protect people who will still need access to cash. But make no mistake, we are not on a stepping-stone to a cashless society, we are nearly there already.</p> <p><em>patrick.collinson@theguardian.com</em></p>",
  "<p>When the 1975 released the song Frail State of Mind last October, the opening line, \u201cGo outside? Seems unlikely,\u201d felt like a typical Matty Healy lyric: heavy emotions, light touch. Now, he says, it\u2019s one of many moments on the band\u2019s fourth album, Notes on a Conditional Form, that have acquired an uncanny resonance. \u201cThis album asks the same question as the last record,\u201d he says. \u201cCan the centre hold? Is this weird? It\u2019s slightly fearful. It\u2019s going to come out at a time when that feels quite justified.\u201d</p> <p>Well, yes. In a kinder timeline, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/the-1975\">the 1975</a> would be headlining US arenas and enjoying the full pre-release hoopla as you read this. So much for that. When lockdown loomed, Healy asked himself where he most wanted to be. Whenever he\u2019s not making music, he has \u201can inherent lack of purpose\u201d, so he headed straight for the band\u2019s residential studio in Northamptonshire with drummer and co-producer George Daniel. After finishing some production work, the pair started playing around with new 1975 material.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYYQpTbBSBM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wYYQpTbBSBM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The current situation has seeped into the lyrics \u2013 for a songwriter as attuned to society\u2019s background noise as Healy, how could it not? \u2013 but he is treading carefully. \u201cYannis from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/foals\">Foals</a> said the other day there\u2019s no prize for the first person to make the definitive corona album,\u201d Healy says, laughing, when we meet over FaceTime. He is in bunker mode: shaggy hair, baggy shirt, a dusting of stubble, a pack of cigarettes on the go. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in reactive statements. I\u2019m interested in living in an environment and then reflecting what that\u2019s like. I want to see what the conversations are and what people turn into.\u201d</p> <p>It is a wonder that the 1975 have anything left in the tank after Notes on a Conditional Form. Announced two years ago as a companion piece to the chart-topping, Brit-winning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/nov/29/the-1975-a-brief-inquiry-into-online-relationships-review-sex-social-media-and-the-state-of-the-nation\">A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships</a>, its 22 songs have taken 19 months in 15 studios in four countries. Longer than Fleetwood Mac\u2019s Tusk and just a few minutes shy of the Beatles\u2019 White Album, it features, among other things, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/25/why-greta-thunberg-joined-the-1975\">Greta Thunberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/28/fka-twigs-in-shadow-of-man-robert-pattinson-surgery-new-album-miranda-sawyer\">FKA twigs</a>, a duet with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/25/better-oblivion-community-center-review-dead-oceans-indie-power-combo\">Phoebe Bridgers</a> about repressed homosexuality in middle America, a country-rock tour diary, a shoegazer\u2019s love song, a house banger fronted by Cutty Ranks, and a song written by Healy\u2019s dad 30 years ago. The governing themes, says Healy, are \u201canxiety, violence and unattainable beauty\u201d.</p> <p>He thinks it is the best 1975 album; it\u2019s certainly the <em>most</em> 1975 album. Far from your typical radio-friendly unit-shifter, it doubles down on the band\u2019s reputation for sounding like anything and withholding nothing: an inevitable consequence of their frontman\u2019s whirling brain. Thoughts fly off him like sparks from a wheel. If this compulsion to say whatever is on his mind makes him a divisive figure \u2013 to some the mood board for a generation, to others a pretentious motormouth \u2013 then so be it. \u201cI\u2019m not an avocado,\u201d he says, accurately. \u201cNot everyone thinks I\u2019m amazing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69a40ff09c77d42b9ed156e103208d121d9a368e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69a40ff09c77d42b9ed156e103208d121d9a368e/577_0_2432_2432/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Was it something I said?

We make records and we live together. So it\u2019s not striving to be bold; it\u2019s avoiding being bored.\u201d</p> <p>The final track, Guys, is a sweet love song dedicated to the band he formed at Wilmslow high school in Cheshire: \u201cThe best thing that ever happened.\u201d This is the first album where he has allowed himself to look back. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talking about life in your 30s on this record,\u201d says Healy, who turned 31 in April. \u201cLike All My Friends by LCD Soundsystem: looking at my scene looking back on itself.\u201d That means reflecting on his life and the choices he has made. \u201cMy 20s was fucking chaos and I didn\u2019t live a domestic life so there are lots of things I\u2019ve just not learned. I\u2019m not emotionally very mature. There have been times when it does damage my relationships [he split up with the model Gabriella Brooks last summer] and I ask myself: \u2018Why do I value my career so much?\u2019 I\u2019m trying to relinquish that idea. I want to have a period in my life when I\u2019m not conflicted about it.\u201d</p> <p>Healy says he is trying to avoid any activity that doesn\u2019t actively serve the 1975\u2019s music. In March, he tweeted a spiky joke about social media (\u201cStop telling people to support you we don\u2019t want your EP and zine bundle right now Laura we\u2019re going to die\u201d) that prompted accusations of obnoxious privilege and made him want to keep quiet. \u201cMaybe that was my last venture on to Twitter,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019ve been burned by it \u2013 I don\u2019t give a fuck, I get cancelled every week \u2013 it\u2019s that I\u2019m more interested in my longform statement. I\u2019m comfortable putting out a record but not comfortable promoting myself. The idea of superficial self-promotion really stings people\u2019s eyes at the moment because it feels frivolous.\u201d </p> <p>The current crisis of purpose among celebrities fascinates him. As the son of two tabloid-haunted actors, Tim Healy and Denise Welch, he says he never found fame exotic. If anything, it seemed a drag. \u201cI don\u2019t feel the need to be present in the culture unless I have a song out. A lot of artists have found that this enormous void has been created and think: \u2018What can I do to take up the space I normally did? I\u2019ll do a cover of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/elton-john\">Elton John</a> on Instagram.\u2019 It\u2019s created this new culture of content.

Since the 1975 released the first two tracks from the new album last summer \u2013 the protest-punk bottle-rocket People and a Greta Thunberg monologue set to music \u2013 he is expected to take a position on everything. When you are celebrated for spraying opinions like a firehose, your omissions raise suspicions. He thinks the funniest line on the album comes from Roadkill: \u201cI took shit for being quiet during the election and maybe that\u2019s fair, but I\u2019m a busy guy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo be honest with you I was so disillusioned,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\">Jeremy Corbyn</a>, I don\u2019t like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson\">Boris Johnson</a>, I didn\u2019t trust either of them. My point is: yeah, I know, but I\u2019m doing my bit. Start on someone else.\u201d Pick your battles, he advises other artists, but do pick something. \u201cIf you want to get involved in creating stuff, be prepared to say something because people are feeling a real sense of pointlessness. I think after this there\u2019s going to be a postwar feeling. I can\u2019t imagine something superficial changing the world.\u201d</p> <p>This is the kind of grand pronouncement that aggravates the sceptics, but Healy is often his own sharpest critic. He uses dialogue in his songs \u2013 half-real, half-invented \u2013 to interrogate himself. Integral to his commitment to honesty and self-awareness (\u201cIf you\u2019re making art, the bits you want to leave out are probably the bits you should put in\u201d) is the knowledge that honesty and self-awareness can turn into just another shtick if you are not careful. \u201cPeople who overshare because they think it\u2019s endearing can be quite exhausting. Self-deprecation is fine if it\u2019s real but anything performative is annoying. If people feel like you\u2019re curating their perspective of you they think: fuck off, just tell me the truth.\u201d</p> <p>These days, much of that personality curation takes place online. Healy is one of few songwriters who can examine internet culture without rendering you paralysed by embarrassment, because his music sounds the way the modern world feels: overstimulated, lurching between excitement and anxiety. \u201cThe overarching theme on my records is communication and conversation,\u201d he says. \u201cGod, heaven, hell, reincarnation \u2026 they\u2019re all amazing ideas but the only thing that\u2019s actually going to happen is this: me and you, talking and thinking about it. How we do that and why we do that is all I\u2019m really interested in.\u201d</p> <p>Now, we are being forced to live online like never before \u2013 a development that Healy finds surprisingly benign. \u201cIt\u2019s almost approaching the utopian, original idea of the internet, which is the extension of pre-existing relationships. The internet is a massive social experiment that\u2019s given us the freedom to do anything, and it seems like what we want is an environment for our anger and anxiety, but that\u2019s not what it was invented for.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1jw6Jw1Fqk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/m1jw6Jw1Fqk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Healy has also been thinking about how music will change. Before the crisis, many artists were talking about reimagining live music in a more environmentally sustainable way. Healy, who has junked the current 1975 stage show, thinks that the industry\u2019s hard reboot will force their hands. \u201cThe gig\u2019s up. It\u2019s done,\u201d he says, waving his cigarette. \u201cWe need to fucking change the world. In live music, the doors aren\u2019t going to be kicked from the outside. They\u2019re going to be kicked from the inside by people like me and Alex Turner and Dua Lipa. It\u2019s about sacrificing the way things used to work because they don\u2019t work any more.\u201d</p> <p>They certainly don\u2019t work right now. For the 1975, the hard sell that attends a major release has come to a halt. No more gigs, TV appearances, billboard campaigns. Notes on a Conditional Form will simply appear online and stand or fall on its own merits. Healy has made his peace with that.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to me that this record feels like it came out at a different time. What people are excited about now is fundamental shit, like going for a walk, like being able to see their mum. So it\u2019s eclipsed all the superficial dances you usually do around a record.\u201d In a way this feels apt. \u201cI have been obsessed with the idea of the end of an era and going into a new decade. This fucking feels like it. We\u2019re in a new world.\u201d</p> <p><em>Notes on a Conditional Form is out on Friday 22 May</em></p>",
  "<p>Notttingham Trent University students Eleanora Brown and her boyfriend Nizar Ruiz are in lockdown at home in Norwich, with no prospect of returning to campus any time soon. The teaching buildings are closed and the university has released all of its tenants from paying rent this term. Yet their hall of residence, run by Collegiate, a private developer, is demanding \u00a31,700 from each of its residents to cover the summer term.</p> <p>While students at most university-owned accommodation do not have to pay rent for the third term, Brown and Ruiz are among thousands of students trapped in expensive contracts with private hall operators.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8650a05c5e410b0aa9af3fe142b177e75687265a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8650a05c5e410b0aa9af3fe142b177e75687265a/6_264_1852_1111/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nizar Ruiz and Eleanora Brown\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nizar Ruiz and Eleanora Brown, students at Notttingham Trent University.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nizar Ruiz</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brown\u2019s father, Russell, says: \u201cAs Eleanora is in lockdown at our family home and will not be returning to NTU for lessons, she asked if Collegiate would cancel her tenancy contract for the final term. It has refused to do this.</p> <p>\u201cWe think it morally corrupt that the government, through Student Finance England, loans Eleanora money which she has to pay to Collegiate and top up with her own money for accommodation she is no longer living in, and for facilities that are no longer available to her. She has to repay her student loan while Collegiate and the building owners (whoever that may be) get to keep the profits.\u201d</p> <p>Collegiate says its halls have remained open, and it has offered to let all students defer their next rent payment until August. It says NTU has not cancelled teaching \u201crather changed from face-to-face to online \u2026 all their students\u2019 education is continuing as is all financial support in terms of loans and grants\u201d.</p> <p>Steve Denton, the NTU chief operating officer, says: <em>\u201c</em>We urge Collegiate to reconsider their position. Students are staying away to respect government advice. They should not be penalised financially for being responsible citizens.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not just Collegiate that is still sending rent demands to students. Last week Emily Smith received a bill for \u00a31,287 from The Apollo Works, her hall of residence at Coventry University (operated by a company called Host) to cover the third term of this academic year. Yet Coventry shut its campus in March, Smith has been at home in Hertfordshire since then, and the hall of residence is, she says, virtually empty.</p> <p>Host operates 12,000 student beds in 22 cities across the UK and Ireland, but has no single policy on early cancellation. In Plymouth, it operates six student halls of residence, and has allowed students at four to terminate their contracts early. But that is not an option at its two other blocks in the city.</p> <p>It\u2019s a mixed picture across privately owned halls. The good news is that Unite, the biggest private provider of student accommodation, has agreed to let students <a href=\"https://www.unitestudents.com/the-common-room/health-and-wellbeing/coronavirus-student-faqs#leaving\" title=\"\">surrender tenancy agreements</a> and is giving refunds to those who paid in advance. But Fresh Student Living has <a href=\"https://freshstudentliving.co.uk/2020/03/20/covid-19-coronavirus-your-questions-answered/\" title=\"\">warned</a> its 18,000 tenants that they may not be released early from their contracts.</p> <p>More than 1,600 students have <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/allow-students-to-suspend-rent-agreements-at-fresh-student-living?source_location=topic_page\" title=\"\">signed a petition against Fresh</a>, which says: \u201cIt is categorically unfair and greedy to charge students for rent if they are unable to live in their accommodation.\u201d</p> <p>Fresh says it only operates the buildings and is not the underlying owner. In those owned by its parent company, Watkin Jones, students who have left can claim a credit for the final rent instalment. It adds: \u201cA number of owners have agreed to offer credits or refunds to students. Unfortunately, not all owners have been able to agree some form of refund.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the landlords refusing to cancel rents are based in offshore tax havens.</p> <p>At Host\u2019s Apollo Works in Coventry, where Smith rents, the landlord named on her contract is not Host but two firms called BR Student Housing Nominee 1 Ltd and BR Student Housing Nominee 2 Ltd. These are based in Jersey, with documents naming shareholders as BlackRock (Channel Islands) and BNP Paribas (Jersey). Both are giant international investment companies, with BlackRock controlling assets worth more than $7tn (\u00a35.64tn). </p> <p>Smith is not alone in her anger. A petition, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/blackrock-make-black-rock-release-students-from-rent?source_location=topic_page\" title=\"\">Make</a> Black Rock<a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/blackrock-make-black-rock-release-students-from-rent?source_location=topic_page\" title=\"\"> Release Students from Rent</a>\u201d, says: \u201cStudents are vulnerable targets of private companies who want to make a financial gain, especially in this particularly hard time. This has affected tenants of not only Apollo Works, Coventry, but also Hope Street Apartments, Liverpool, The Old Dairy, Plymouth and Frobisher House, Plymouth. All of which are under the same landlord, BR Student Housing Unit Trust.\u201d</p> <p>Host says: \u201cDecisions on the cancellation policies of contracts are outside of our control and made by the individual building owners. In respect of The Apollo Works, we have been advised by the building\u2019s owner that it will not be possible to terminate the contracts of those residents who have decided to leave their accommodation.\u201d</p> <p>But halls of residence make up only a part of the student rental market, catering mostly for first-year students. The larger rental market is second and third-year students who move out of halls. Many are also finding that while their university has closed, their landlords are still demanding full rents.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e095275a7a3190defe2b54a2a836e9598afef1d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e095275a7a3190defe2b54a2a836e9598afef1d6/0_105_918_551/500.jpg\" alt=\"Ruth Day\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ruth Day has joined a strike against a local student lettings agency.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ruth Day</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ruth Day, a third-year maths and philosophy student at Bristol University, faces a \u00a31,320 rent bill for her final term even though she has vacated the property.</p> <p>\u201cAll of us are in a tight money spot right now, be that because we\u2019ve lost jobs or because of the uncertainty of when we\u2019ll next get money and it seems unreasonable that our landlord, who appears to be very wealthy, is so unsympathetic to our situation,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She has decided to join a rent strike with 130 other students in Bristol, with a campaign targeting local lettings agency, Digs. It is just one of a wave of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/hundreds-of-students-in-uk-sign-up-to-rent-strike\" title=\"\">rent strikes</a> by students across the UK.</p> <p>Digs says it has suggested to all of its landlords a number of ways in which they could support tenants who were finding it difficult to pay their rent. \u201cMany landlords have released tenants early, some have offered zero rent, some have offered half rent, some have agreed other arrangements,\u201d it says. \u201cSome, usually those who heavily rely on the rent, are still requesting full rent as is their legal right.\u201d</p> <p>Legal experts say whether or not students must continue to pay rent during the lockdown will depend on the type of accommodation and their tenancy agreement.</p> <p>Daniel Fitzpatrick, a housing partner at law firm Hodge Jones &amp; Allen Solicitors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/06/student-housing-do-i-still-need-to-pay-if-ive-left\" title=\"\">told Guardian Education</a> that students could try arguing that the contract has been frustrated by the Covid-19 outbreak. There may also be a break clause allowing them to terminate the contract before the end of the fixed term after providing the required notice.</p> <p>But students are generally advised to negotiate with their landlord immediately, as the obligation to pay rent will continue in accordance with their contract, and they could remain liable for any rent due up to the expiry of the notice period.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"440b31e1b0b5c7fe7bc99bb2f0ed8cddb336c7e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/440b31e1b0b5c7fe7bc99bb2f0ed8cddb336c7e0/13_0_777_466/500.jpg\" alt=\"Rent protest by Bristol University students.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rent protest by Bristol University students.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ruth Day</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Also worth considering is what happens in September when the new academic year begins.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Global number of confirmed cases passes 4.5m</h2> <p>According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University at least 4,542,752 people are known to have been infected and 307,696 people have died worldwide since the pandemic began. The figures are likely to represent a significant underestimate of the true scale of the pandemic.</p> <h2>Democrats push $3tn response bill forwards</h2> <p>The US House of Representatives has narrowly approved a $3tn bill crafted by Democrats to provide more aid for battling the coronavirus and stimulating a faltering economy. But Republican leaders, who control the Senate, and Donald Trump have vowed to block it, despite some Republican support for provisions aimed at helping state and local governments.</p> <h2>Trump unveils \u2018warp-speed\u2019 drive for vaccine by year\u2019s end</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> has announced details <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/15/trump-coronavirus-warp-speed-vaccine-white-house\">of a \u201cwarp-speed\u201d effort to create a coronavirus vaccine</a> by the end of the year, even as experts warn that such a breakthrough could take longer than 18 months. During remarks in the White House Rose Garden on Friday that had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/truck-protest-donald-trump-coronavirus\">to compete with honking from protesting truck drivers</a>, the US president also urged schools to reopen in the autumn and insisted: \u201cVaccine or no vaccine, we\u2019re back.\u201d</p> <h2>Mexico sees highest daily confirmed infections</h2> <p>As Mexico moves toward a gradual reactivation of its economy from Monday, the number of new coronavirus infections grows higher every day, raising fears of a new wave of infections that other countries have seen after loosening restrictions, AP reports. There were 2,437 new coronavirus test confirmations Friday, the highest daily total yet and the second straight day with over 2,000 new cases.</p> <h2>Trump to restore partial funding to WHO - report</h2> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s administration is set to restore partial funding to the World Health Organization, <a href=\"https://fxn.ws/3bFNpuG\">Fox News reported late on Friday</a>, citing a draft letter. The Trump administration will \u201cagree to pay up to what China pays in assessed contributions\u201d to the WHO, Fox News reported, quoting from the letter. Trump suspended US contributions to the WHO on 14 April, accusing it of promoting China\u2019s \u201cdisinformation\u201d about the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <h2>Italy to allow travel to and from abroad from 3 June</h2> <p>Italy\u2019s government has approved a decree allowing travel to and from abroad from 3 June, moving to unwind one of the world\u2019s most rigid coronavirus lockdowns. The government will allow free travel across the country from that same day. Some regions had pushed for a swifter rollback but the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has insisted on a gradual return to normal to prevent a second wave of infections.</p>",
  "<p>The Trump administration has fired the state department\u2019s inspector general who is reported to have been investigating the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, for a potential abuse of office.</p> <p>The inspector general, Steve Linick, was given notice of his dismissal late on Friday night and is to be replaced by Stephen Akard, a close ally of the vice-president, Mike Pence, from his home state of Indiana. A state department spokesperson said that Akard, who has been running the office for foreign missions, would take over immediately as acting inspector general.</p> <p>According to a Democratic congressional aide, just before his abrupt dismissal Linick had opened an investigation into allegations that Pompeo had been using a political appointee at the state department to run personal errands for him and his wife, Susan.</p> <p>Under US law the president is required to give 30 days\u2019 notice before firing an inspector general, to allow Congress to investigate the reasons for dismissal. In recent months Congress has not used that month-long notice period to prevent the termination of other watchdog officials fired by the president.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1261483732952891393/photo/1\">letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives</a>, Trump said: \u201cIt is vital that I have the fullest confidence in the appointees serving as Inspectors General. That is no longer the case with regard to this Inspector General.\u201d</p> <p>Linick is the latest in a string of officials in watchdog roles fired by the president in recent months, turning on its head the tradition that such jobs are filled with non-partisan figures. Trump has demanded personal loyalty from officials working in the administration, especially those in an oversight role.</p> <p>\u201cThis firing is the outrageous act of a president trying to protect one of his most loyal supporters, the secretary of state, from accountability,\u201d said Eliot Engel, the Democratic chair of the House foreign affairs committee. \u201cI have learned that the Office of the Inspector General had opened an investigation into Secretary Pompeo. Mr Linick\u2019s firing amid such a probe strongly suggests that this is an unlawful act of retaliation.\u201d</p> <p>Linick is not the first inspector general to be fired late on a Friday night. On 3 April this year Trump dismissed the intelligence community inspector general, Michael Atkinson, who had first deemed credible a whistleblower complaint expressing concern about Trump\u2019s call last summer to his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, which ultimately triggered impeachment proceedings against the president.</p> <p>On 1 May Trump dismissed the principal deputy inspector general at the department of health and human services, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-replaces-hhs-watchdog-who-found-severe-shortages-at-hospitals-combating-coronavirus/2020/05/02/6e274372-8c87-11ea-ac8a-fe9b8088e101_story.html\">Christi Grimm</a>, who had published a report about shortage of medical supplies at hospitals around the country in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s be clear: all of these moves are punishment for doing the jobs the law authorizes and requires IGs [inspectors general] to do,\u201d Michael Bromwich, former justice department inspector general, said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mrbromwich/status/1256429349743603712\">in a tweet</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThis will not end until Congress takes these retaliatory firings seriously. The appointment of a crony of the VP further politicizes jobs that by statute are supposed to be non-partisan. Another important norm defiled.\u201d</p> <p>In 2019 a state department whistleblower <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/01/politics/pompeo-democrats-whistleblower-claims/index.html\">reportedly alleged</a> that Pompeo had used his security detail to run chores like picking up food and picking up the family dog from the grooming salon.</p> <p>Walter Shaub, former head of the US Office of Government Ethics, said: \u201cThe assault on the IG is late-stage corruption, and Trump\u2019s kicking down one of the last bulwarks that stand between us and the burgeoning corruption-driven authoritarianism.\u201d He added some advice to journalists: \u201cCover it like you\u2019re a foreign correspondent in a collapsing republic. Because you are.\u201d</p>",

The state officially entered phase one of its \u201c<a href=\"https://nvhealthresponse.nv.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Roadmap-to-Recovery-Phase-One-Initial-Guidance.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery\">roadmap to recovery</a>\u201d last weekend, but the casinos at the heart of the state\u2019s economy remain closed. Casino executives have made it clear that they are ready and prepared to reopen, but without a clear go-ahead from the governor, the industry remains in limbo.</p> <h2><br><strong>\u2018What the new normal is, we don\u2019t know\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Over the weekend, phase one eased restrictions on \u201cnon-essential\u201d businesses located off the Las Vegas Strip, including restaurants, salons and retail stores. Some Las Vegans, such as Pam Cartwright, a hair stylist, returned to work. Although her salon can only operate at half-capacity, on reopening weekend, her chair was fully booked.</p> <p>When asked how her workplace is coping with the restrictions, Cartwright described clients leaving the salon with wet hair (the state is discouraging blow-outs to prevent the spread of pathogens). She detailed sanitizing sinks and credit card machines between clients while trying to maintain social distancing via salon-style musical chairs.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s so many things you don\u2019t even think about,\u201d Cartwright said, describing keeping the workplace safe and clean.

She said her employer had not communicated any details about a reopening plan and she worried it could take months.</p> <p>For public-facing service industry workers like Cartwright, the anxieties extend far beyond the idiosyncrasies of operating a virus-free workplace. For many hospitality workers, there is a lingering fear that temporary furloughs could become permanent layoffs.</p> <p>\u201cReturning the economy to a sense of normal is going to take time,\u201d said John Restrepo, a principal consultant at the Vegas-based RCG Economics. \u201cWhat that new normal is, we don\u2019t know yet, but it\u2019s not going to be where casinos are operating on the weekends at 90% occupancy.\u201d</p> <p>Bigger casino companies such as MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment have made it clear that they will reopen in<a href=\"https://news3lv.com/news/coronavirus/caesars-plans-to-reopen-properties-in-phases\"> phases</a>.

In a<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9QSUoJo8Hw\"> video</a> shared with team members and posted to YouTube, the Caesars Entertainment CEO, Tony Rodio, told furloughed employees the most difficult part of their reopening plan was that \u201cwe will not be able to bring back everyone immediately\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/las-vegas-strip-closed-coronavirus\">After the end of the world: the eerie silence of the Las Vegas Strip</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For those union workers under a collective bargaining agreement, most <a href=\"https://www.culinaryunion226.org/members/contract/recall-from-layoff\">contracts</a> include language that requires companies to recall laid-off workers by seniority.

They plan to implement significant changes across hotel procedures, from check-in to dining to table games. But with cards being dealt face up and dealers disinfecting dice between shooters, necessary sanitation protocols could disrupt the prime gambling experience that people travel specifically to Las Vegas to get.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s smart to be cleaning chips and dice, but one thing that gamblers like is action,\u201d Bauer said. \u201cIf the pace slows down considerably, that\u2019s going to be tough to sell.\u201d</p> <p>In the coming weeks, Las Vegas can only offer best guesses on how to keep that pace up during \u201cvirus time\u201d. Until casinos are allowed to turn the lights back on, the city will have to wait to see how its chips will fall.</p>",

All four claim that due to Kean\u2019s political connections they could face serious penalties, including imprisonment, if they were to return to Fiji.</p> <p>They also claim that they were themselves subject to harsh punishments from the commissioner, including regularly being forced to jump into a pond of sewage, having their wages docked for weeks at a time and being ordered to walk 20km before and after work each day.</p> <p>In 2007, Kean pleaded guilty to manslaughter after he beat a man at the wedding of his niece,<strong> </strong>the daughter of the prime minister Frank Bainimarama, Kean\u2019s brother-in-law. The man died of a brain hemorrhage. Kean was convicted for manslaughter and sentenced to 18 months in prison, though he was released after just a few months. He was appointed to the position of commissioner in 2016.</p> <h2>\u2018I had no other option\u2019</h2> <p>The officers all claimed that corporal punishment was commonplace in the prisons and that Kean would routinely indicate to them that they were to assault inmates.</p> <p>\u201cHe won\u2019t say it directly,\u201d said De Wachter. \u201cHe will say this Fijian word: <em>\u2018cakava ga na ka e dodonu me caka\u2019 </em>(Just do what is supposed to be done to them).

De Wachter claimed that on around 10 occasions he and other officers were ordered to jump into a pool of sewage at a piggery attached to the prison.</p> <p>De Wachter and Talemaisolomoni said they fell out of favour with Kean in 2018 for allowing the general secretary of the opposition party to visit Karunaratne.</p> <p>In his application for asylum, which has been seen by the Guardian, Talemaisolomoni wrote that he did not know the visitor was a politician and that he was \u201cblamed for having a political intention in allowing the visitation\u201d. </p> <p>Talemaisolomoni and De Wachter claimed that after the incident Kean ordered them to walk 20km every morning and 20km every evening between Naboro prison and Suva, while being watched by a patrol car. The Guardian has seen an email purportedly from Kean that supports this claim. </p> <p>Prison officers claimed they also routinely had their pay docked. In an email seen by the Guardian, purportedly sent from Kean to De Wachter, Kean wrote: \u201cYou still have a lot to learn. Too weak \u2026 discipline that\u2019s the answer to their financial woes.\u201d</p> <p>De Wachter and Talemaisolomoni said they fear political persecution if they return to Fiji. The men expressed concern that Kean\u2019s relationship with the prime minister and connections with the military could prevent them from living and working safely in Fiji.</p> <p>Two of the men \u2013 Talemaisolomoni and Delana \u2013 have had their asylum claims refused by the Australian government.</p> <p>In Talemaisolomoni\u2019s refusal letter, which has been seen by the Guardian, the Department of Home Affairs accepted that he \u201creceived physical, verbal, financial and psychological challenges from Mr Kean in the course of his job\u201d and that Kean \u201cthreatened the applicant once on 4 June 2018 with an imprisonment sentence if he was found guilty of associating with the opposition\u201d.</p> <p>However, the department did not accept that there were direct threats of harm to the applicant from the prime minister, the police, or the military.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8897fc8e4b927a69d0a4dc75d8df118d5c1706a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8897fc8e4b927a69d0a4dc75d8df118d5c1706a4/0_0_6640_4427/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Delana, 43, who served in a variety of roles during his 10 years in the Corrections Service.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Delana, 43, who served in a variety of roles during his 10 years in the Corrections Service.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carly Earl/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Talemaisolomoni and Delana are awaiting a tribunal hearing to appeal the decision.

This is how you treat motherfuckers like him.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian has not been able to independently verify the recording, but it has been widely reported.</p> <p>The Pacific Rugby Players Welfare <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58dcfe39d482e901dc8e0abb/t/5e9dc971d17720281f592510/1587399025795/World+Council+letter-+re%3B+Francis+Kean+%28Fiji%29.pdf\">wrote a scathing letter to the World Rugby Council</a> urging them not to elect Kean its executive committee.</p> <p>\u201cIt is extraordinary to anyone involved in the game in the Pacific that Kean is even on the ballot,\u201d wrote Dan Leo, the director of PRPW, which support players of Pacific Island heritage. \u201cHis time in office has become a byword for intimidation, vindictiveness, corruption and self-dealing, nepotism, and the threat and realisation of violence.\u201d</p> <p>Francis Kean and the Fiji Corrections Service were contacted by the Guardian for comment, but had not responded by the time of publication.</p>",
