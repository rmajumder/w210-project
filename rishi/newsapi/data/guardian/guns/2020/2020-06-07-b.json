private firms and medical associations ahead of a probable scenario where public hospitals run out of critical care beds. <br></p> \n  <p>Providers will be able to charge a daily fee of up to 16,000 rand ($950) for Covid-19 patients that get treated in critical care beds in private hospitals, <strong>Anban Pillay</strong>, the health ministry\u2019s deputy director-general for national health insurance, told Reuters. <br></p> \n  <p>The fee includes the cost of using the bed, paying a team of specialists to treat the patient and additional services including pathology and radiology. <br><br> Estimates vary widely as to how many critical care beds there are in the country.

pressure to ease restrictions further across the country ahead of the end of its three-week progressive <em>deconfinement </em>programme, after the country\u2019s scientific advisory committee

tourists and France\u2019s borders remain closed except for essential business and personal reasons. Ch\u00e2teau staff said there was a rush on the place on Saturday, but even so they have 4,000 visitors instead of the 20,000 a day on a normal June weekend.</p> \n  <p>France reported 31 new deaths from Covid-19 in the 24 hours to Saturday, bringing the total to 29,142 since March.

  "<p>A senior detective investigating one of Britain\u2019s most controversial spy scandals has appealed to both ex-IRA and retired soldiers to help him get the truth about the killing of a young woman in the Troubles.</p> <p>Jon Boutcher is a former chief constable of Bedfordshire and the head of Operation Kenova, which is investigating the military intelligence agent known as Stakeknife who betrayed the IRA for three decades.</p> <p>Boutcher has been tasked to review several unsolved killings from the Northern Irish conflict, and on Monday will make the unusual step of issuing a direct appeal to former British soldiers and IRA operatives to pass on any information they have about the 1972 killing of Jean Smyth-Campbell.&nbsp;</p> <p>Smyth-Campbell was shot dead in the front passenger seat of a green Austin 1100 car in west Belfast after a night out at the Glenowen Inn on the Glen Road on 8 June 1972. There have been conflicting allegations over the years that either a local IRA unit or British soldiers fired the shots that killed the 24-year-old.</p> <p>Stressing that Smyth-Campbell was an innocent victim of what appeared to be a random shooting incident during the most violent year of the Troubles, Boutcher said he wanted to finally establish the truth about what happened to her and bring closure for her family.</p> <p>The shooting occurred at a roundabout close to a bus station facing an army post that protected a local electricity substation.</p> <p>Addressing both ex-IRA and former British troops who may have served in the area at the time, Boutcher said: \u201cI have a completely open mind. All I want is for her family to get finally get the truth about what happened to Jean that night.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever the circumstances at the time, please could you find it in your hearts to come forward with any information that might help Jean\u2019s family establish the truth? If you have information or were involved, come and talk to us at Operation Kenova in order to help us understand what happened.\u201d</p> <p>Boutcher said he was particularly keen to trace a red-haired girl who was described by witnesses as helping to put Smyth-Campbell into a taxi that then took her to hospital.</p> <p>Smyth-Campbell\u2019s sister Margaret McQuillan, who was 12 at the time of the shooting, also called on people to come forward with information regardless of their role that night. She said: \u201cFor years my Mammy used to stand at the window, waiting for Jean to come home. She and my dad both went to the grave not knowing the truth.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels as though we have been living a lie for more than 40 years and have fought hard to get the investigation independently reviewed, so we can establish the truth of what happened. We need people to come forward and tell the team what they know.\u201d</p> <p>Boutcher added that anyone with any information should call his detective team on 01234 858-298 or email kenova@met.police.uk. </p>",
  "<p>Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, will look again at whether military courts should be allowed to try rape cases in the UK after three women serving in the armed forces said they would bring a legal challenge aimed at changing the policy.</p> <p>Government lawyers said the cabinet minister had decided to give the subject \u201cfresh consideration\u201d after the women complained, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/03/women-launch-legal-action-to-stop-military-courts-trying-uk-cases\">in a case first reported by the Guardian</a>, that conviction rates in military courts for rape were five to six times lower.</p> <p>The women, who cannot be named, all say they were victims of rape or serious sexual assault while serving, although none of their cases, all of which where handled by the military courts, resulted in a conviction.</p> <p>They had begun a legal challenge aimed at changing the rules so that the civil justice system would automatically handle all cases of rape involving forces personnel in the UK.</p> <p>One of the women, whose case resulted in an acquittal, said she was \u201creally pleased\u201d with Wallace\u2019s change of heart. \u201cThe treatment of my case by the military justice system intensified the trauma of what happened,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t ignore the fact that the board in my case was entirely male, which must be quite common when you consider that the board is randomly picked from all higher ranking members of the armed forces. The board in my case were all men and they acquitted my assailant very quickly,\u201d she added.</p> <p>A second woman said handling rape cases through the military system was \u201cunfair on both the victim and the accused,\u201d partly because the military police who have to investigate \u201care not career detectives\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cInstead they sometimes do a draft of as little as two years within the Special Investigation Branch, and can handle the investigation with not much experience or guidance,\u201d she added.</p> <p>\u201cIt is terrifying, as a victim, to know that you are having to report a horrific experience to a person who could end up policing the same unit as you in the future.\u201d</p> <p>All three women are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of their experiences. Two \u2013 one from the army and one from the navy \u2013 are in the process of being medically discharged.</p> <p>Last month, the three women told the Ministry of Defence they intended to seek a judicial review of a controversial decision made by Wallace in February to allow the military justice system to continue to try rape and other serious crimes, which had troubled many women serving in the forces.</p> <p>Military courts have been able to try rape and other serious offences since 2009. But in theory, civilian law should take precedence where an alleged offence takes place somewhere in the UK.</p> <p>In practice, however, that is disregarded by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) where only military personnel are involved. Data shows that increasing numbers of rapes and other sexual offences are now dealt with in the military system \u2013 rising from 95 in 2015 to 178 in 2019.</p> <p>A total of 129 rape cases were heard at military courts martial in the five years to 2019, 13 of which (10%) resulted in conviction, according to MoD figures. The civilian conviction rate during that period ranged between 57% and 63%, according to the CPS.</p> <p>A review of the service justice system \u2013 which includes military police, prosecutors and the courts \u2013 by the retired senior crown court judge Shaun Lyons concluded that the military system \u201cshould no longer include murder, manslaughter and rape\u201d except with the attorney general\u2019s consent.</p> <p>That conclusion was ignored by Wallace in February, and at the time the MoD said it believed the military system was \u201ccapable of dealing with the most serious offences and should be able to continue to do so\u201d.</p> <p>The rethink was announced in a letter to Emma Norton, the director of the Centre for Military Justice, who is the lawyer handling a challenge to that decision. In it, government lawyers said: \u201cThe secretary of state has decided to give fresh consideration to the matters that your clients seek to challenge\u201d.</p> <p>Norton said: \u201cI hope this proves to be the first vital step in ensuring that victims of rape in the armed forces can get a decent shot at justice. Now the MoD must make good on its promise to genuinely look afresh at this vitally important and incredibly sensitive issue.\u201d</p> <p>The third woman added: \u201cIf the conviction rate in the service justice system is significantly lower, and that has been clear to the MoD for years, why is the MoD resisting us at all? It is obvious that they need to do the right thing.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>\u2018Yeah, I\u2019m a ratbag,\u201d says Bradley Murdoch over the phone from the prison where he has been jailed for 16 years. \u201cI\u2019ve belted a lot of fuckin\u2019 people. I\u2019ve run a bit of pot. But I\u2019m not a fuckin\u2019 murderer.\u201d</p> <p>Two courts disagree. In 2005, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/08/we-know-who-did-this-how-solving-peter-falconios-changed-a-detectives-life\">a jury convicted 47-year-old Murdoch of&nbsp;shooting Peter Falconio in the head</a> before before assaulting and attempting to abduct his girlfriend, Joanne Lees, on a remote stretch of highway north of Alice Springs in Australia\u2019s Northern Territory on 14 July 2001. In 2007,&nbsp;appeal judges upheld his conviction.</p> <p>Lees\u2019 account, told in court and in her book No Turning Back, is that she and Falconio&nbsp;were driving that night from Alice Springs to Darwin, planning to get married at Bora Bora before flying home. But they were flashed down by a driver.&nbsp;Falconio, 28, got out of their camper van and was shot dead by Murdoch. Lees, 27, was then threatened with a gun,&nbsp;punched in the head, bound with cable ties and bundled into the back of Murdoch\u2019s truck. She managed to escape and ran off into the moonless night.&nbsp;For five hours, she hid in bushes while Murdoch and his dog searched for her.</p> <p>Eventually, he gave up and drove off. Lees flagged down a passing truck, whose drivers cut her restraints and called the cops. Murdoch was convicted on the strength of Lees\u2019 identification&nbsp;and because his DNA was found on the shirt she was wearing after the attack.</p> <p>Murder in the Outback: the Falconio and Lees Mystery (Channel 4) reopens the case after nearly 20 years.&nbsp;What was Murdoch\u2019s&nbsp;motive? Where is Falconio\u2019s body?&nbsp;Why, asks a professor who describes himself as a specialist in \u201chuman secretions\u201d,&nbsp;was there no blood spatter at the scene, just pools of blood, if Falconio had been shot? Why would a hitherto careful drug runner, asks the author of a book on the case, bundle an abducted woman into the back of his truck containing&nbsp;$200,000 of hydroponically grown cannabis?&nbsp;Most of all, what was the deal with the mysterious red car and the so-called jelly man spotted up the road from the crime scene?</p> <p>The appeals judges ruled the case was overwhelming. Andrew Fraser&nbsp;demurs. \u201cI believe he\u2019s had about the roughest end of the pineapple you can get,\u201d said&nbsp;Fraser, a colourful, if disgraced, former defence lawyer who has been investigating the case. The questions he raises are worrying.&nbsp;Why, for instance, were only Lees\u2019 footprints found in the bush near the crime scene, not those of Murdoch or his dog? Why did Murdoch\u2019s Australian working dog not sniff out Lees, given that she was hiding only 35 metres from the road?</p> <p>The most disturbing issue, though, arises&nbsp;when Fraser interviews the lorry driver who picked up Lees. Vince Millar recalls something he has never&nbsp;mentioned before. Just before he found Lees on the highway, he says, he noticed a parked red car and, beside it, two men holding up a third. \u201cI saw this bloke who looked like jelly,\u201d he recalls. \u201cHe was in the middle of two blokes.\u201d He pulled over and asked if they were all right, but they got into the car and sped off. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that the bloke in the middle was Peter Falconio.\u201d If so, then, just possibly, Falconio survived his own murder.</p> <p>One of the reasons Murdoch\u2019s conviction has long been supposed by some to be doubtful is because of how Lees behaved before the media.&nbsp;Just as there was supposed to be something wrong with Meursault for not crying at his mother\u2019s funeral in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/14/camus-letranger-stranger-than-fiction-alice-kaplan\">Albert Camus\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/14/camus-letranger-stranger-than-fiction-alice-kaplan\">L\u2019\u00c9tranger</a>, so Lees\u2019s refusal to perform her grief on telly made some think she was&nbsp;hiding something.</p> <p>Lees, doubtless, will hate this four-hour series, not least because it serves up&nbsp;the night she says her life&nbsp;was destroyed as entertainment. It is a masterclass in true-crime telly, right down to the fact I worried more about the motives of the people who made it than about Murdoch\u2019s motive for killing Falconio, if he did. There are all the hackneyed moves from&nbsp;the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/making-a-murderer\">Making</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/making-a-murderer\"> a Murderer</a> playbook: moody piano arpeggios, slow-mo footage, dodgy audio from prison phone calls and cliffhanger reveals just before the closing credits to keep you coming back for more.&nbsp;</p> <p>One reporter suggested the case is real-life Agatha Christie, but maybe the truth is that there is&nbsp;no mystery: maybe it all went down just as Lees said and Murdoch&nbsp;is much worse than a ratbag.</p>",

Russia appears to be trying to reach an understanding on spheres of influence within Libya whereby Moscow has influence in the east and Turkey in the west.</p> <p>The GNA last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/un-backed-libyan-forces-oust-renegade-general-from-tripoli\">lifted a yearlong siege of Tripoli</a> by Haftar\u2019s forces, a victory that was celebrated by the GNA prime minister, Fayez al-Sarraj, flying low over Tripoli in his presidential plane.</p> <p>Haftar\u2019s principal regional backer, the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, rushed on Saturday to issue a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/06/egyptian-president-announces-plan-for-ceasefire-in-libya\">call for a ceasefire</a> starting on Monday, and the relaunching of political talks. But his appeal, supported by France at the weekend, looked like a belated conciliatory act forced upon Egypt by the self-evident collapse of Haftar\u2019s project to capture Tripoli. The Turkish presidential spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin,&nbsp;advised Cairo to abandon support for Haftar, saying, \u201cHis time is up.\u201d The GNA called for him to be tried for war crimes and said he could not be involved in any talks on Libya\u2019s future.</p> <p>Haftar himself did not seem to have accepted how weak his hand had become, demanding that Sisi make \u201curgent and effective efforts to compel Turkey to completely stop the transfer of weapons and mercenaries to Libya\u201d. Influence in the east appeared to be ebbing away from Haftar and towards the Libyan parliament speaker Aguila Saleh, whose chamber is based in the east.</p> <p>Bashagha said the GNA would hold political talks, but only after retaking Sirte and the al-Jufra base. His commitment to pushing the Russians out of the airbase would be welcomed by the US, which has belatedly woken up to the Russian hybrid warfare in Libya.</p> <p>Russia has not been operating overtly in Libya, instead using unmarked planes and as many as 1,000 mercenaries. Few believe the Russian forces are present without the tacit approval of the president, Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>The GNA announced that it was planning to try two captured Russian mercenaries, saying it had documents showing the pair were trying to subvert democracy in Libya.</p> <p>At present Turkey looks like the winner from last year\u2019s fighting since the decision of its president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, to give overt backing to the GNA in defiance of an UN arms embargo paid off. Turkey said it was now in line to win reconstruction contracts, access to gas fields in the eastern Mediterranean, and even a slice of Libyan oil reserves.</p> <p>The Libyan National Oil Company said on Sunday that production had resumed at the Sharara oil field, the country\u2019s largest, which was shut months ago by Haftar\u2019s forces.</p> <p>Sharara, about 900km (560 miles) south of Tripoli, produces 315,000 barrels a day \u2013 nearly one third of Libya\u2019s crude output \u2013 but is frequently attacked and blockaded by militias.

  "<p>For a few frantic hours last Thursday, executives from 250 clubs across five continents were immersed in the world of online speed dating. Every 10 minutes a fresh encounter would start. Small talk would be made. An understanding be reached. Perhaps even a deal struck. Then a button would be pressed and the whole process would start again.

The message to those clubs from Jonas Ankersen, its founder and chief executive, is seductive: they can take back control when it comes to transfers. The pitch seems to be working: more than 500 clubs are involved, paying a monthly subscription of \u00a3165 to \u00a32,500 depending on whether they are League Two level or in the Champions League.</p> <p>The site lets clubs see which players are available and to gather information by direct message \u2013 without the often tortuous and expensive process of going through agents and intermediaries. The first deal on the platform was for \u00a33m in 2017, between two Championship clubs, and Ankersen is expecting well over 100 more this summer.</p> <p>\u201cThe big benefit is that some deals can go faster,\u201d says the Dynamo Dresden sports director, Kristian Walter, who described the site as a \u201cquiet revolution\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to contact three, four or five agents. You can go straight to the club. If I need a player and I don\u2019t have direct contact with the club the agent has the power.

Although predictions varied, the Feyenoord director of football, Frank Arnesen, was not alone in his assessment that there could be a fall in fees by as much as 25%-30%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c36998a8bd5fe1c9ef129aa244efaa4727a71ed6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c36998a8bd5fe1c9ef129aa244efaa4727a71ed6/0_0_1125_2094/537.jpg\" alt=\"Transfer Room\" width=\"537\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Transfer Room has helped arrange over 250 player transfers since launching in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Transfer Room</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf your club has money in the next transfer window, it will be great for business,\u201d he says. \u201cBut most of the clubs haven\u2019t because of the pandemic. At Feyenoord we have 300 people \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to tell them you have had to reduce your income, only to then buy this player and that player. For me it is very important to re\u2011sign the players that are out of contract. If we can do that we will be strong. But we will probably only bring in two or three loan players, because we can\u2019t spend a lot of money.\u201d</p> <p>Arnesen, who was previously at Tottenham and Chelsea, raised another pertinent point. \u201cEveryone is hoping things will be back to normal in a year\u2019s time but it will be interesting to see how long it will take for football to recover,\u201d he says. \u201cOwners of many clubs own big companies and a lot of them will have lost money. Sponsorship, tickets and TV income is not there any more at the same level. So maybe it will be longer than everyone thinks.\u201d</p> <p>But Ivan Kepcija, the sporting director of Hajduk Split, says the disruption may help smarter clubs with less money to progress up the pyramid quicker than they otherwise may have done. \u201cWe hope the big leagues will continue spending as planned because from them it trickles down to clubs like ours,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if the owner of a top club is financially hit in his personal business that may well affect his team. So you might see some powerhouses going down, some mid-level clubs emerging to be in the top standings.</p> <p>\u201cYou will maybe see clubs that have good recruitment practices and are savvy, and have worked on the markets, improved as a result. It will be a big transition for some and this will be an opportunity for smaller clubs to rise up.\u201d</p> <p>The Rangers sporting director, Ross Wilson, says it is too early to make predictions. \u201cWe are in such an uncertain place, the only thing we can guarantee is that things will be different. Transfer fees, wages and agents\u2019 fees will go down \u2013 we can see that already. It is a very different market place than it was four months ago.\u201d</p> <p>Walter hopes the events of the past few months will make football\u2019s powerbrokers reset the relationship with supporters and reassess the game\u2019s place in wider society.</p> <p>\u201cThe corona pandemic is a good chance for all the clubs to focus on what football really is,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause it has become more a business: about money, money, money. That is OK to an extent but some of the financial payments almost now come from another universe. A player can be transferred to a country for \u20ac200m but in that same city there are people that cannot even buy food. It is simply crazy.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/06/gianni-infantino-salary-caps-coronavirus-fifa-premier-league-tests\">Gianni Infantino ponders salary caps in post-coronavirus football</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But with the Premier League <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/04/premier-league-project-retstar-five-substitutions-nine-players-on-bench\" title=\"\">back next week</a> Ashworth is preferring to remain optimistic. \u201cThe industry has taken a big hit.

It\u2019s time for the voices of BAME people to be heard \u2013 from those youngsters who can\u2019t follow their dreams because they don\u2019t conform to the stereotype of \u2018who does which sport\u2019, to athletes dealing with subtle or overt racism, to those who do everything asked of them to transition into coaching or leadership roles, but never even get the interview.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/06/watford-andre-gray-george-floyd-stereotyped-and-judged-by-police\">Watford's Andre Gray: 'It's not just about George Floyd \u2013 we are still stereotyped and judged by police here'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAt a time when the pandemic has thrown a range of inequalities into sharp relief, the exclusion of ethnic minorities from swathes of the sport and activity landscape represents not just a massive denial of opportunity, but also has to be a factor in the disproportionate impact of the virus on BAME communities.\u201d</p> <p>Grant, who has worked inside grassroots and elite sport for 15 years, said disparities were evident from early life, where in England 38% of black children are defined as \u201cless active\u201d, compared with 29% of white children, despite having more positive attitudes towards activity, and went right through to elite sport and the boardroom.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad the emphasis in the last few days has been on white leaders reflecting and listening,\u201d Grant said. \u201cSo maybe this week we can say out loud what has been obvious for a long time. Whatever the intentions of any particular individuals or organisations, sport in the UK conforms to Lord Macpherson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/macpherson-report-what-was-it-and-what-impact-did-it-have\">definition of institutional racism</a>.</p> <p>\u201cYou can look at some sports and think things are OK but scratch the surface and you\u2019ll see significant imbalances exist. Eight of the 23 players in England\u2019s men\u2019s football squad for the 2018 World Cup were black or mixed race. By coincidence that was the same number as BAME members of the 100-plus FA council at that time. It was also higher than the number of BAME managers or head coaches of the then 92 clubs.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never had a black Olympic swimmer and if you looked at the GB hockey squads taking part in last year\u2019s World League at the Lee Valley Olympic Legacy site, you would never guess they were in one of the most diverse places on the planet. But the inequalities are so deeply rooted within sport\u2019s structures and assumptions that the situation amounts to a kind of apartheid hiding in plain sight.\u201d</p> <p>Grant said that three years ago he had tried to get politicians and sports officials interested in Mission 2032, with the aim of getting Team GB\u2019s and Paralympics GB\u2019s squads, coaching and support teams reflecting the UK population in terms of ethnicity and socio-economic background across every sport.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody nodded their heads but I don\u2019t think anyone really took it seriously.

  "<p>George Floyd\u2019s name is now known around the globe; his death has sparked protests from Berlin to Mexico City. The extraordinary cruelty of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\" title=\"\">his killing</a> has shocked the world. But his death has resonated so widely not because it was exceptional, but because it was not. Not exceptional in the US, where the toll of African Americans who have died at police hands is long and shameful. And not, unfortunately, exceptional elsewhere.</p> <p>Tens of thousands gathered at the weekend in London, Manchester, Cardiff, Glasgow and other parts of the UK. In Bristol, protesters toppled a statue of slave trader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/27/bristol-city-slave-trader-edward-colston\" title=\"\">Edward Colston</a>. But the movement has also brought people on to the streets in Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires; in Abuja and Nairobi; in Barcelona, Copenhagen and Paris. These marches express solidarity and outrage that the richest and most powerful country in the world should continue to treat its people this way. Demonstrators oppose the racial legacy it embodies, and the brutal, militarised police response to protests.</p> <p>But though they honour the African American experience, they also recognise the commonality of black struggles elsewhere, and more broadly the fight for human rights. The words \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d are chillingly familiar. In Australia, they evoke the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/01/family-of-david-dungay-who-died-in-custody-express-solidarity-with-family-of-george-floyd\" title=\"\">David Dungay</a>, an Indigenous man who uttered those words 12 times as he was restrained by prison guards.

Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/11/lets-end-delusion-britain-abolished-slavery\" title=\"\">prefers to remember</a> its abolition of the slave trade to its role in industrialising slavery. It finished paying the bill for reparations to slave owners only five years ago. Many people still see empire as a conduit for the spread of cricket and railways. A broader curriculum, which is surely needed, would reveal it as a system of exploitation and white supremacy, with repercussions felt to this day.</p> <p>BAME people <a href=\"https://www.inquest.org.uk/bame-deaths-in-police-custody\" title=\"\">die disproportionately</a> as a result of the use of force or restraint by police, but not one officer has been convicted of manslaughter or murder in decades. Protesters in the UK have highlighted the shooting of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/mark-duggan\" title=\"\">Mark Duggan</a>, the Metropolitan police\u2019s growing use of stop-and-search, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\" title=\"\">Windrush scandal</a>, the disproportionate exclusion of black boys from schools and the failure to act on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/08/the-guardian-view-on-race-and-criminal-justice-inequality-is-unfair-to-all\" title=\"\">Lammy report</a>, which highlighted glaring disparities in the criminal justice system. But they have also raised the impact of austerity, the Grenfell fire and the fact that BAME people are so much more likely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds\" title=\"\">to die of Covid-19</a>. Racism is structural, and state neglect can be as deadly as state abuse. It does not always take a knee on the neck to kill someone. Poverty, overcrowding, and unequal access to healthcare can be fatal.</p> <p>It is the increased threat from coronavirus which has driven many to the streets. Though protesters have largely been assiduous in their use of face masks and hand gel, there is a real danger that these gatherings will spread infection. Subsequent self-isolation by participants would help to reduce the risks. But when Dominic Cummings got a free pass for his drive to Durham, the leader of the house has forced MPs to return to a crowded chamber, and the government is ignoring warnings that lockdown is being relaxed too quickly, they must not be scapegoated for any rise in infections. Already, black people in London are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/03/met-police-twice-as-likely-to-fine-black-people-over-lockdown-breaches-research\" title=\"\">twice as likely to be fined</a> for breaching coronavirus regulations as white people.</p> <p>To say that black lives matter is not only to demand that they are not stolen, but to insist that they are truly valued. No one expects this to be realised overnight; but nor are they willing to wait. The breadth of the protests is testament to what has gone wrong, but also a promise that change is possible. The protests are black-led but multiracial, showing the growing breadth of support. As in the US, white people are seeking to be allies. Other people of colour are identifying with black experience, while recognising that they too may benefit from racial hierarchies, and may themselves discriminate. Mistakes will be made. But progress can and must be made, too.</p>",

The devolved administrations have yet to set out how they will police the rules.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e138d538-fd07-4b6e-9b5f-87be2de2d401\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Britain\u2019s three biggest airlines have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/07/ba-launches-legal-battle-over-covid-19-quarantine-ruling\">started legal proceedings against the government</a> in a&nbsp;bid to overturn&nbsp;quarantine rules due to take effect in the UK from Monday. What are the new restrictions on international arrivals and how will they be enforced?</p>\n    <p><b>How will arrivals be tracked?</b><br>Most people arriving in the UK will need to fill in an online form with contact and travel details and the address where they will be staying in quarantine for the next 14 days. Self-isolating people can shop for essentials such as food and medicine. Random checks will be carried out by Public Health England.</p>\n    <p><b>Who is exempt?</b><br>A large list of people, including anyone on government or defence business, foreign diplomats, regular international commuters, lorry drivers, medical workers and fruit pickers. By and large, the exemptions are international key workers.</p>\n    <p><b>How it will be enforced?</b><br>In England, fines start at \u00a3100 for not filling in the form, \u00a31,000 for breaching self-isolation and possible deportation for foreign nationals not complying. However, the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have yet to say if and how they will enforce the rules for any arrivals in their jurisdictions \u2013 an anomaly that IAG and others argue undermines the process.</p>\n    <p><b>Given people can\u2019t travel anyway, why do airlines and travel firms object?</b><br>Although lockdown rules prevent overnight stays in the UK, and the Foreign Office has warned against all non-essential foreign travel, signs of progress had led airlines to plan more flights over the next two months, after grounding fleets in March. Holiday firms hoped people would start booking trips. They argue that imposing the rules so late in the pandemic is ineffective, illogical, and will deter visitors and potential outward bookings long after the quarantine rules are lifted.</p>\n    <p><b>Why does the government say they are necessary?</b><br>The government says the measures are backed by science and will help prevent a second wave of Covid-19 cases imported from abroad, as other countries move out of lockdown, with restrictions on work and movement potentially eased further in the UK in coming weeks.</p>\n    <p><b>Have other countries imposed similar quarantine measures?</b><br>Yes, many either ensured arrivals self-isolated or closed borders to foreign visitors. However, Britain decided against doing so early in the crisis and is now bringing in quarantine just as other EU countries are in the process of opening up.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The letter, the first step in an application for judicial review, was sent on Friday. A Ryanair spokesperson, commenting on behalf of the three airlines, said: \u201cThese measures are disproportionate and unfair on British citizens as well as international visitors arriving in the UK. We urge the government to remove this ineffective visitor quarantine which will have a devastating effect on UK\u2019s tourism industry and will destroy even more thousands of jobs in this unprecedented crisis.\u201d</p> \n<p>The government has argued that the quarantine rules are science-based and would help limit the risk of a second wave as restrictions on movement are eased.</p> \n<p>The home secretary, Priti Patel, said: \u201cWe all want to return to normal as quickly as possible. But this cannot be at the expense of lives. The science is clear that if we limit the risk of new cases being brought in from abroad, we can help stop a devastating second wave.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat is why the measures coming into force today are necessary. They will help control the virus, protect the NHS and save lives.\u201d</p> \n<p>Posters spelling out the new requirements for travellers will be displayed at all UK ports and airports. Airlines will be expected to notify passengers of the rules, but not to enforce them.</p> \n<p>The director general of Border Force, Paul Lincoln, said officials were \u201cprepared and ready for the new measures which are being&nbsp;enacted at the UK border today\u201d.</p> \n<p>The quarantine row comes amid further uproar over BA\u2019s plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/british-airways-plans-to-make-up-to-12000-staff-redundant\">sack </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/british-airways-plans-to-make-up-to-12000-staff-redundant\">about 12,000</a> staff and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/25/ba-plans-to-fire-workers-only-to-rehire-on-worse-terms-union-says\">lower the terms and conditions</a> of remaining employees.</p> \n<p>The pilots union Balpa told members on Saturday the airline had increased the number of pilot redundancies it was seeking by another 125 to almost 1,300, more than a quarter of the workforce.</p> \n<p>It warned that BA had said it would \u201cforce changes by terminating the employment of all pilots and offering individuals new contracts with associated new terms and conditions\u201d if they could not find agreement.</p> \n<p>The airline appears to have made concessions on a possible voluntary redundancy scheme, which it initially ruled out, saying it would pay only the statutory minimum to longserving staff.</p> \n<p>BA may also start furloughing senior pilots from the grounded A380 and 747 fleets, who had agreed to effectively halve their pay by taking unpaid leave at the start of the crisis to allow for a possible quick return to flying.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/01/covid-19-cloud-has-silver-lining-for-a-lighter-leaner-british-airways\">flag carrier\u2019s actions</a> have been condemned by ministers and unions.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, which represents cabin crew, said: \u201cBA and its&nbsp;owners IAG can afford to see out this crisis without such drastic cuts.

  "<p>We are concerned about the impact that Covid-19 is having on the 45,000 deaf children in the UK. Many deaf children and young people describe that deaf peers are very important to them, but they currently have limited access because of lockdown. Many use British Sign Language as a preferred language at school but may have limited access to this at home, relying instead on lip reading, facial expressions and other means. The increasing use of face masks creates large communication problems for deaf children and young people.</p> <p>A research study in recent years showed much higher rates of mental health problems in deaf children. One main factor for this includes the challenges they face in a hearing society. Covid-19 is creating additional challenges.</p> <p>Our national deaf child and adolescent mental health service (NDCAMHS), with 10 centres across England, supports deaf children and young people with mental health problems. We are currently seeing rises in complex mental health issues exacerbated by isolation and communication problems in the context of Covid-19.</p> <p>Face masks play a part in the response to control the spread of Covid-19. We ask that where this protection is necessary, options are carefully considered including see-through masks and see-through face shields that are resourced and made available in healthcare and education settings, especially those where deaf people are present.</p> <p>We also ask that consideration is given to making sure that deaf children and young people have access to good communication and to deaf peers through electronic means, or other special arrangements as the lockdown is relaxed.</p> <p>The UK is traditionally good at considering the needs of multiple different groups within society, and we ask that deaf children and young people are given consideration as we plan for the future.</p> <p> <strong>Prof Barry Wright </strong><em>Chair of child mental health, University of York; Clinical lead, National Deaf CAMHS,</em><strong> Rachael Hayes </strong><em>Deaf service consultant, National Deaf CAMHS, </em><strong>Lenka Novak</strong><em> Deaf mental health adviser, National Deaf CAMHS, </em><strong>Tim Richardson </strong><em>Manager, National Deaf CAMHS, North, </em><strong>Neil Norman </strong><em>Manager, National Deaf CAMHS, Midlands, </em><strong>Robson Tanhara </strong><em>Manager, National Deaf CAMHS, South-east and London, </em><strong>Dr Nico Gentili </strong><em>Consultant child psychiatrist, National Deaf CAMHS, </em><strong>Dr Andy Holwell </strong><em>Consultant child psychiatrist, National Deaf CAMHS, London, </em><strong>Dr Sophie Roberts </strong><em>Consultant child psychiatrist, National Deaf CAMHS, North, </em><strong>Dr Rob Walker </strong><em>Consulant child psychiatrist, National Deaf CAMHS, Midlands </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"http://gu.com/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p>",
  "<p>The number of confirmed deaths from coronavirus globally has topped 400,000, as the Chinese government released a report lauding its own response to the pandemic that emerged in the city of Wuhan six months ago.</p> \n<p>As more countries prepared to continue easing their lockdowns from Monday, Singapore\u2019s prime minister warned the city-state\u2019s citizens that they were entering a tougher world of slowing demand and travel restrictions for the foreseeable future.</p> \n<p>The lengthy report released by Beijing on Sunday said <strong>China</strong> had \u201cwasted no time\u201d in sharing information such as the virus\u2019s genome sequence with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other governments. Its claim contrasts with criticism from US leaders and in records from internal WHO meetings published by the Associated Press last week that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/china-withheld-data-coronavirus-world-health-organization-recordings-reveal\">the government was slow</a> to release key information needed to develop tests, drugs and a vaccine.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe Chinese government did not delay or cover up anything,\u201d said the national health commission chairman, Ma Xiaowe. \u201cInstead, we have immediately reported virus data and relevant information about the epidemic to the international community and made an important contribution to the prevention and control of the epidemic around the world.\u201d</p> \n<p>More than a quarter of deaths from the disease in the world have occurred in the<strong> US</strong>, with more than 40,000 deaths in the <strong>UK</strong> and more than 30,000 in <strong>Brazil</strong> and <strong>Italy</strong> making up the next quarter. Total infections are approaching 7 million.</p> \n<p>Tensions between the US and China have escalated as a result of the pandemic, with the Republican senator Rick Scott sparking a fresh row on Sunday when he claimed Beijing was meddling in the search for a vaccine, \u201ctrying to sabotage us or slow it down\u201d. He told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show his information came from \u201cour intelligence community\u201d, but presented no evidence or further details.</p> \n<p>About six months since the first reports of the virus started emerging from southern China, regions in the world were at starkly different stages in their fight against it. On Sunday, <strong>China</strong> downgraded the danger from the virus in its north-east Jilin province to low, meaning nowhere in the country was any longer considered at high risk of an outbreak.</p> \n<p>Parks in <strong>Turkey</strong> and streets in <strong>Jordan</strong> were full as both countries relaxed their onerous lockdowns under economic pressure, while <strong>France</strong> opened the Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles to the public on Saturday after a closure of 82 days.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, countries such as <strong>India</strong> and <strong>Brazil</strong>, which weeks ago appeared to be avoiding serious outbreaks, were struggling to contain their caseloads. \u201cDelhi is in big trouble \u2026 corona cases are rising rapidly,\u201d the Indian capital\u2019s chief minister,&nbsp;Arvind Kejriwal,&nbsp;said in a video message on Twitter, where he announced that private and city government-run hospitals would be reserved for Delhi residents.</p> \n<p>India on Sunday registered 9,971 new coronavirus cases, taking the country\u2019s tally to 246,628 cases, with 6,929 deaths. The case numbers lags behind only the US, Brazil, Russia, UK and Spain.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we open Delhi hospitals for patients from all over, where will Delhi residents go when they get infected with coronavirus?\u201d Kejriwal said. Typically, about 60%-70% of patients admitted to hospitals in Delhi are people travelling from other states to get treatment at the city\u2019s hospitals.</p> \n<p>Other countries, such as <strong>Iran</strong> and <strong>Panama,</strong> were dealing with a resurgence of the virus after seemingly having turned the corner. Panama announced on Saturday it would reintroduce restrictions&nbsp;on the movement of people in two provinces following an increase in the number of new cases.</p> \n<p>Iran said its fresh cases were a result of wider testing. \u201cThe main reason for rising numbers is that we started identifying [people] with no or light symptoms,\u201d said the health ministry\u2019s head epidemiologist, Mohammad-Mehdi Gouya.</p> \n<p>The <strong>Singaporean</strong> prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, said in a televised address on Sunday that his country needed to prepare for a more difficult future with higher unemployment and less global trade and travel. \u201cCountries will have less stake in each other\u2019s wellbeing,\u201d Loong said. \u201cThey will fight more over how the pie is shared, rather than work together to enlarge the pie for all. It will be a less prosperous world, and also a more troubled one.\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>Pope</strong> <strong>Francis</strong>&nbsp;broke from his prepared text in an address on Sunday, warning <strong>Italians</strong> to not let their guard down against coronavirus now that infection rates had fallen, and urged them to obey government rules on social distancing and the wearing of masks.</p> \n<p>Francis, addressing several hundred people in St Peter\u2019s Square for his Sunday blessing, reacted to applause that broke out when he said their presence, albeit reduced, was a sign that Italy had overcome the acute phase of the pandemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cBe careful. Don\u2019t cry victory too soon,\u201d he cautioned them.</p> \n<p><em>Agencies contributed to this report</em></p>",
  "<p>Charities providing emergency food supplies to people with a limited immigration status known as \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d have expressed concern at the prime minister\u2019s refusal to offer support to a group pushed into destitution by the lockdown.</p> <p>Hundreds of thousands of immigrants in the UK have an immigration status that allows them to work here but prevents them from accessing most benefits should they become unemployed. Many have lost their jobs because of the Covid-19 pandemic and are struggling to feed their families and pay rent; many face losing their homes once restrictions on evictions are lifted.</p> <p>In east London, volunteers have been feeding hundreds of families unable to buy food because work has dried up. Lakmini Shah, a Labour councillor in East Ham, where about 57% of the population were born outside the UK, has been distributing boxes of food and essential items donated by businesses to about local 40 families every week since the end of March.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a perception that immigrants come here to get benefits from the government and that\u2019s not true. These are people who have always worked but who lost their employment as soon as lockdown began, and that\u2019s when their difficulties began,\u201d Shah said, sorting boxes of pasta and rice in her front yard.</p> <p>\u201cMost people feel too embarrassed to talk about this and they don\u2019t know where to go for help. Everyone is worried about how they are going to pay the rent.\u201d</p> <p>MPs have attempted to push this issue on to the political agenda in the past fortnight. During questions from the <a href=\"https://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/8e8e5214-346d-4be8-adf7-addfc839ff6d\">liaison </a><a href=\"https://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/8e8e5214-346d-4be8-adf7-addfc839ff6d\">committee </a>10 days ago, the prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/27/boris-johnsons-liaison-committee-appearance-what-did-we-learn\">appeared to be uncertain about the details of this status</a> and promised to review the policy, saying: \u201cPeople who\u2019ve worked hard for this country who live and work here should have support of one kind or another.\u201d</p> <p>Informed about a Children\u2019s Society estimate that there are <a href=\"https://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/news-and-blogs/press-releases/the-children%E2%80%99s-society-responds-to-the-boris-johnsons-questions-about\">more than 100,000 children in this situation</a>, with no safety net, he said: \u201cWe will see what we can do to help.\u201d</p> <p>However, asked again at prime minister\u2019s questions last week about the growing numbers of migrants who are living and working here lawfully, who have been pushed into extreme poverty because of having no recourse to public funds, Johnson appeared to have been briefed on the immigration category.</p> <p>He declared that \u201ceverybody knows\u201d that no recourse to public funds is a policy that applies to people who have temporary immigration status, adding: \u201cBut it is a term of art; it does not mean that they are necessarily excluded from all public funds.\u201d</p> <p>Stephen Timms, the Labour MP for East Ham who raised the issue with the prime minister last week, rejected this explanation. \u201cFor very many of those affected that\u2019s exactly what it means,\u201d he said, calling on the government to suspend the condition for the duration of the crisis, at least for families with children.</p> <p>He said: \u201cMany hard-working families in East Ham have leave to remain, but no recourse to public funds. They are suffering severe hardship as a result. I agree with the prime minister\u2019s point at the liaison committee, that people in this position \u201cshould have support of one kind or another\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63d69b2b971765130602af4b7e70da87b39f6394\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63d69b2b971765130602af4b7e70da87b39f6394/0_0_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ali and Noreen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ali and Noreen moved to the UK 15 years ago.

His work has dried up as international travel has come to a virtual halt, and he and his wife have been unable to pay rent and have found it difficult to buy food for their three teenage children.</p> <p>Visa renewals for a family of five cost about \u00a312,000, which must be paid every two-and-a-half years, until they are eligible to apply for British citizenship, after a process that lasts 10 years.</p> <p>Putting aside money for visa costs has meant that they have no savings and are struggling to pay rent on their one-bedroom flat. They will need to renew their visas again this October, and are wondering who they can borrow money from and which belongings they can sell to help meet the cost.</p> <p>Although landlords are prevented from evicting tenants during lockdown, the family have been told that they will face eviction later this summer if they are unable to make up their arrears. \u201cWe came here legally. I had a respectable job and paid taxes. It feels unfair \u2013 there is no safety net,\u201d Ali said.</p> <p>Noreen has taken on a part-time job as a care worker in a care home to bring in alternative income, but is on a precarious minimum-wage, zero-hours contract and is not earning enough to pay the rent. They have tried to keep the details of their immigration status from their children, but the oldest is aware that she will struggle to receive funding to study at university here, despite having lived her all her life.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the borough of Newham charities have begun feeding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/01/indian-students-trapped-in-uk-by-coronavirus-actually-starving\">hundreds of students, mostly from India</a>, who have lost the part-time jobs in local shops and restaurants which subsidised their studies.

People have been queuing in the streets in their hundreds and we have had to turn people away,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe have been clear that no one should find themselves destitute during this crisis due to circumstances beyond their control.</p> <p>\u201cWe have taken extensive action to support those with no recourse to public funds, including protections from eviction for renters and mortgage holidays, helping the employed, self-employed and those on zero-hour contracts. Individuals on the 10-year route can apply at any time to have conditions lifted or for access to benefits if their financial circumstances change.\u201d</p> <p>Officials were unable to say how many people have been issued visas with this status or how many people have applied for this exemption, and were unable to reveal the number of people who have been granted an exemption.</p> <p>Charities supporting people with this immigration status say getting an exemption is extremely difficult because it requires individuals to prove that they are destitute.</p> <p>Zoe Gardner, a policy adviser with the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said she felt the prime minister had not understood the gravity of the situation facing many with this immigration status. \u201cHis response suggested that he believes NRPF is some kind of minor technicality, but we see the real world consequences it has every day.</p> <p>\u201cContrary to what the PM said, NRPF bars most migrants from accessing a vast proportion of the social security net we all rely on in times of crisis. They are barred from universal credit, disability allowances, local authority homelessness support, free school meals and access to mainstream refuges for victims of domestic violence, among others.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality is this leaves many thousands in extreme poverty and unable to escape debt or access decent housing or provide for their families\u2019 most basic needs.\u201d</p> <p>The joint council, along with over 40 migrants\u2019 right organisations, has <a href=\"https://www.jcwi.org.uk/our-joint-letter-to-the-prime-minister-its-time-to-scrap-nrpf\">called for the government to scrap the </a><a href=\"https://www.jcwi.org.uk/our-joint-letter-to-the-prime-minister-its-time-to-scrap-nrpf\">no recourse to public funds status</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 8 June 2020 to clarify that East Ham is within the London borough of Newham, not outside it as a previous version had implied.<br></p>",

This led to 14 officers being injured, in addition to 13 hurt in earlier protests this week. We have made a number of arrests and justice will follow. The number of assaults is shocking and completely unacceptable.</p> \n   <p>\u201cI know many who were seeking to make their voices heard will be as appalled as I am by those scenes. There is no place for violence in our city. Officers displayed extreme patience and professionalism throughout a long and difficult day, and I thank them for that.</p> \n   <p>\u201cI would urge protesters to please find another way to make your views heard which does not involve coming out on the streets of London, risking yourself, your families and officers as we continue to face this deadly virus.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-07T08:05:28.735Z\">at 9.05am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edc9a708f083999a26db7b2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-07T07:48:15.429Z\">8.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>On the government continuing to ease lockdown measures despite studies suggesting the UK\u2019s coronavirus infection rate has grown to above 1 in some regions, Hancock said they took into account several models on infections through Sage. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat you shouldn\u2019t do is look at one particular report, and say that is the answer right across the board.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThere are some areas where we think the R rate is a bit higher than elsewhere, including the north-west of England, and we\u2019ve got to make sure wherever our localised outbreaks are we absolutely tackle those working with local directors of public health,\u201d he said. </p> \n  <p>He added that the government\u2019s coronavirus alert level remained at four\u2013 the second highest level \u2013 ahead of shops reopening on 15 June. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWe proceed with caution, we proceed with safety first, making sure that as those shops do reopen that it is safe to do so.\u201d </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-07T07:56:45.902Z\">at 8.56am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edc99ba8f0883ec2fc1c390\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-07T07:42:27.433Z\">8.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"243ac871-36eb-4cd2-908a-f2631b17baf7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3qZUG61PfWk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Hancock also urged people not to gather in more than groups of more than six people to prevent the further spread of Covid-19, after thousands of people gathered for demonstrations in cities including London and Manchester yesterday.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI support very strongly the argument is being made by those who are protesting for more equality and against discrimination,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the virus itself doesn\u2019t discriminate and gathering in large groups is temporarily against the rules, precisely because it increases the risk of the spread of this virus.</p> \n  <p>\u201cSo I would urge people to make their argument, and I will, I will support you in making that argument.

  "<p>When Freeman Yim stepped out to join a peaceful demonstration against a controversial extradition bill on 9 June last year, he never knew it would be the start of a drawn-out movement that would plunge Hong Kong into the deepest crisis in its history.</p> <p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t fighting for much, we just wanted Hong Kong to remain Hong Kong and not turn into just any Chinese city,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to have dignity and basic rights.&nbsp;As the Chinese national anthem says, not to become slaves.\u201d</p> <p>A year later, the 37-year-old mainland-born construction worker feels more depressed than ever. \u201cI feel so helpless and hopeless,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like being a kid on a playground, bullied by a bigger person but having no means to fight back.\u201d</p> <p>China has ruled Hong Kong under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement after its change of sovereignty in 1997, but Beijing\u2019s tightening of its control over the city has caused widespread discontent in recent years.</p> <p>What started off as a protest to stop a proposed extradition law intended to allow people to be sent to China for trial exploded into a sweeping anti-government movement, unleashing unprecedented anger and frustration.&nbsp;Many people who did not care about politics became radicalised.&nbsp;</p> <p>A year on, however, Hongkongers find themselves in a much worse situation.&nbsp;China\u2019s legislature passed a plan in late May to impose sweeping national security laws for Hong Kong to prevent and punish activities that threaten national security, including advocacy of secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference.&nbsp;There is widespread concern that China\u2019s vaguely defined national security laws, used to suppress government critics in mainland China, will erode most of Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms.</p> <p>China insists such laws are necessary to stamp out the protests, which started off peacefully but turned increasingly violent as frustration and desperation mounted.&nbsp;Protests had largely died down as a result of the coronavirus pandemic early this year, but picked up again in late May after Beijing announced the national security law.&nbsp;</p> <p>More than 8,900 people, of whom about 40% were students, have been arrested in more than 1,000 protests since June last year.</p> <p>Sceptics have questioned whether Hongkongers\u2019 fierce resistance has done more harm than good, but many who have participated in the movement, young and old, insist they have done the right thing.&nbsp;</p> <p>They say it was only a matter of a fast or slow death for Hong Kong under China, which had been tightening its grip in a way locals describe as \u201ccooking a frog in tepid water\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWe know we can\u2019t fight against China but now we have forced China to show its true face to the world,\u201d said Chow, 71, who came to Hong Kong as a teenager after experiencing hunger and tumultuous political movements in China.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"26c5dfa40760b10f2ace8647618af958dc595c10\">

\u201cEven if we were to die, we may as well die an honourable death.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Despite the looming draconian measures, many still maintain a strong fighting spirit.&nbsp;The national security law has rekindled a protest movement that had largely died down and fuelled an unprecedented demand for independence from China.&nbsp;In recent demonstrations, many protesters shouted slogans such as \u201cHong Kong independence, the only way!\u201d, which has rarely been heard on the streets before.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cNow that one country, two systems is dead, of course we want to be separated from China.&nbsp;Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to be like Singapore?\u201d said 60-year-old retiree Wong, who took part in a recent rally.</p> <p>In the face of what many call the inevitable \u201cdeath\u201d of Hong Kong, some vow to continue to speak up even if it means risking jail, while others try to learn how to maintain their resistance and conscience under a dictatorial regime.</p> <p>&nbsp;\u201cI will continue to do things I want to do and say things I want to say,\u201d said Lawrence, 25, a retailer. \u201cI will not be silenced. If we have no freedom, it makes no difference whether you\u2019re in jail or not.\u201d</p> <p>While many talk of leaving Hong Kong, Benjamin, a 22-year-old student, vows to stay and resist China.&nbsp;Influenced by the Czech dissident and later president V\u00e1clav Havel\u2019s philosophy of defeating a totalitarian regime by rejecting its lies and \u201cliving in truth\u201d, he said he would try to keep up a spirit of resistance by continuing to exercise his rights and living a normal life.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWe need to learn how to survive under a dictatorship.&nbsp;We can\u2019t allow ourselves to be killed by the Communist party before dawn,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if the protests die down, many of us will insist on exercising our freedoms, maintaining our Hong Kong identity, memory, culture and spirit.\u201d</p> <p>Joseph Cheng, a retired political scientist at the City University of Hong Kong, said while ordinary Hongkongers may not give up on their ideals, \u201cthey have to learn new ways of engaging political struggle under very tight security conditions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe anger is still there, the struggle will continue, but we have to minimise cost and to deny the government legitimacy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be like eastern Europe in the late 70s. It\u2019s going to be a long-term struggle.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>For those not directly affected, the ability to breathe more easily and see further has perhaps been the greatest consolation amid the trauma of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>As city after city begins to emerge from lockdown, urban planners and environmental campaigners are grappling with how to keep the clean air and blue skies that have transformed our view of the world. \u201cCitizens around the world can see change is possible,\u201d says Zoe Chafe, an air quality specialist with the C40 group of global megacities. \u201cJust put yourself on the rooftop and imagine seeing mountains for the first time, and thinking how amazing it feels to realise this is possible.\u201d</p> <p>That rooftop could be in Kathmandu (where residents were astonished to <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/travel/destinations/lockdown-effects-mt-everest-visible-from-kathmandu-after-decades-as-pollution-level-goes-down/as75802249.cms\">make out Mount Everest for the first time in decades</a>), Manila (where the <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2020/04/manila-gets-its-skyline-back-as-air-quality-improves-amid-covid-19-lockdown/\">Sierra Madre became visible again</a>) or dozens of other cities across the world.</p> <p>Not everywhere has seen air quality improvements in recent months. In some Asian cities, such as Hanoi and Jakarta, pollution has become worse. But, for the most part, people across the world are experiencing a healthier alternative to the smoke and smog that are responsible for an estimated 3 million deaths a year.</p> <p>Having seen the shroud lift, there is a growing clamour not to let it fall again. Cities across the world are exploring ways to permanently reduce pollution. Chafe says there is no quick, one-case-fits-all solution, but there are lessons \u2013 on environmental justice, community activism, urban design, climate ambition, technological innovation and municipal leadership \u2013 that can be learned from the cities and states that were making progress even before the lockdown. Here are three.</p> <h2>Copenhagen</h2> <p>Copenhagen has the world\u2019s most ambitious plan to cut emissions: carbon neutral by 2025. This is pushing the Danish capital to go beyond the existing model of smart, clean urban design and cycle-centred transport that has turned it into one of the cleanest cities in the world.</p> <p>Grassroots activism, pragmatic government and high taxes have been the drivers for change. Old photographs prove the city had as much of a car culture as any European city in the 1970s, when more than 100,000 citizens demonstrated in R\u00e5dhuspladsen (City Hall Square) to demand their streets back. Since then, town planners have steadily reduced parking spaces and widened areas for pedestrians and bicycles.</p> <p>Jeppe Juul, of the Danish Eco Council, says it is a question of priorities. \u201cIt feels good to walk around Copenhagen,\u201d he says, adding that in some areas of the city \u201cpedestrians have more space than bikes, and bikes have more space than cars.\u201d The city now vies with Amsterdam for being the most bicycle-friendly city in the world.&nbsp;This means traffic lights with resting bars that riders can hang on to without touching the ground, take-away coffee containers designed for bikes, and groups that organise parent\u2019s shifts for schools runs on \u201cminibus-like\u201d bicycles that can take up to six children at a time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"092c89d06533c44221a0defd163b9382de17190d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/092c89d06533c44221a0defd163b9382de17190d/0_224_3872_2325/1000.jpg\" alt=\"HC Andersens boulevard in Copenhagen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">HC Andersens boulevard in Copenhagen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Forsberg/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Copenhagen\u2019s 2025 target depends largely on replacing coal-fired heating with biomass, wind and geothermal energy. A new district-heating infrastructure will allow neighbourhoods to scrap home boilers. Urban planners aim to use carbon capture and storage technology to trap emissions from the main municipal waste incinerator.</p> <p>Some still doubt the city will be zero-carbon within five years, but Mikkel Krogsgaard Niss, from the mayor\u2019s office, says sceptics have been proved wrong in the past. \u201cFrom 2014-20, we reduced carbon dioxide by&nbsp;more than 50%, so we are on our way,\u201d he says.&nbsp;</p> <p>These shifts will create up to 35,000 jobs, with most of the money coming from public coffers. Residents already pay some of the highest rates of tax in the world, but this is seen as <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2016-01-20/why-danes-happily-pay-high-rates-of-taxes\">an investment in health and quality of life</a>. The city\u2019s wastewater plant was also expensive, but now that it is operational, residents can swim in the harbour \u2013 something unthinkable in urban waterways elsewhere. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20200419-coronavirus-five-countries-with-the-best-healthcare-systems\">Danes are consistently </a><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20200419-coronavirus-five-countries-with-the-best-healthcare-systems\">ranked among the world\u2019s healthiest and happiest people</a>.</p> <p>The municipality also wants to completely phase out combustion engines by electrifying the bus fleet and banning petrol and diesel cars within five years. After that plan ran into opposition from the national government, local environmental NGOs lobbied for a revolutionary new traffic management scheme that hugely decreases the convenience of car use. The \u201cdistribution plan\u201d, which was pioneered in the Belgian town of Ghent, divides the urban centre into a handful of zones and prohibits drivers from going directly from one to another. Instead, they have to go via the suburbs. \u201cIt means there is no such thing as a short drive to the bakery or wherever in this system,\u201d says Jens M\u00fcller, the air quality manager of the Transport &amp; Environment NGO. As a result, walking, cycling and public transport become more appealing. \u201cIt\u2019s the most radical thing you can do apart from creating a no-car zone,\u201d says Juul.</p> <p>Copenhagen is in a group of European cities, including Amsterdam, Paris, London and Oslo, that are trying to set the global pace for air quality improvements. M\u00fcller says London is a leader on ultra-low emission zones, Oslo on promoting use of electric cars, while Paris is exploring radical plans for \u201ca city of 15 minutes\u201d that aims to ensure every resident can get the shops and services they want within a short walk or bicycle ride. Cities in Germany are pioneering pop-up infrastructure and tactical urbanism that allow communities to block roads at certain times for certain events. In Brussels, residents now have a say in when to close roads for children\u2019s parties and barbecues. M\u00fcller says this reduces pollution because people spend more time outside their homes.</p> <p>The foundation, he says, is community activism by previous and current generations. Amsterdam may now be aiming for zero-carbon boats and yet more bikes, but \u2013 like Copenhagen \u2013 the origins of its strong air-quality ambition was the parents\u2019 movement in the 1970s, which campaigned against the number of road traffic accidents with banners demanding: \u201cStop murdering our children.\u201d More recently, Madrid has seen a fierce political contest for control of the streets, with 20,000 people rallying last year to oppose plans by the ruling rightwing coalition to reopen the city centre to cars. The \u201cMadrid Central\u201d zone in the Spanish capital had achieved more <a href=\"https://www.transportenvironment.org/news/people-power-and-courts-fight-first-ever-attempt-scrap-low-emissions-zone\">nitrogen dioxide reductions than any city in Europe</a>. So far, people power has kept the cars out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e6b2b9062e178fe60d7165966216fb4edfc8b200\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6b2b9062e178fe60d7165966216fb4edfc8b200/0_125_4171_2503/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oakland \u2026 harnessed the power of environmental activism.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oakland \u2026 harnessed the power of environmental activism.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Melpomenem/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>California (Oakland and Los Angeles)</h2> <p>The importance of grassroots activism has recently been enshrined into law in California, where campaigners have persuaded the government that if it wants to improve air quality it needs to empower low-income BAME neighbourhoods, which are worst affected because they often live closest to pollution sources.</p> <p>California has made impressive strides since the 1980s, when Los Angeles, Oakland and San Jose were notorious for a toxic haze that blanketed the city for more than 200 days of the year. These days, thanks to tighter regulations, higher petrol standards and less reliance on coal, there are usually fewer pollutants in the air and about 60 more days of blue skies a year. Several cities have also launched \u201cgreen new deals\u201d. Even the car capital of the world, Los Angeles, is trying to nudge commuters on to an upgraded public transport system.</p> <p>But perhaps the most impressive work is being done at the community level by local activists in hotspots of pollution. The leading light in this initiative is Margaret Gordon, who has spent almost 30 years campaigning for environmental health and social justice in her West Oakland neighbourhood, a part of the San Francisco Bay Area that sits between two highways, a busy port, factories and the proposed site of a coal terminal.</p> <p>She first realised how badly her mostly black and Latino community was affected in 1992 when she started working part-time at a local school where she saw shoeboxes full of asthma inhalers, each with the name tag of a different child. \u201cThat was the start,\u201d she recalls in a Zoom chat interrupted by her coughing. \u201cAfter that, I went to a local meeting to express my righteous outrage about the conditions in the neighbourhood.\u201d</p> <p>Gordon began monitoring the numbers of trucks that passed through on their way to the port. She later received training and funding to measure levels of fine particulate matter known as PM2.5 that can enter the bloodstream and cause respiratory disease. Even inside her home, the readings were unhealthily high.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf139ca45917963ed9c33f9820babec2e7c952f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf139ca45917963ed9c33f9820babec2e7c952f5/0_0_6144_3686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Gordon \u2026 has managed to get laws changed to improve the environment.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Gordon \u2026 has managed to get laws changed to improve the environment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of WOEIP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She founded the West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project, and worked with scientists, who collected data to prove what she had long believed \u2013 that low-income minority communities are far more likely to suffer the ill effects of air pollution (later including higher vulnerability to Covid-19) than other sectors of society.</p> <p>The pressure has reaped results. The California Air Resources Board ordered the port to take action. There is now stricter regulation of trucks, the port has electrified its facilities and the planned coal terminal has been blocked. Air pollution is 74% lower than in 2008, according to the port. Gordon wants more. \u201cThe windowsills have gone from black to grey. But there is still a long way to go. We still have hotspots.\u201d</p> <p>Her biggest achievement, however, may have been to help draft state law AB617, which passed in 2017 and put local communities at the centre of emissions reductions planning. West Oakland is now one of three Californian neighbourhoods that have drafted their own action plan for dealing with pollution sources. Air quality activists hope this will also address the tendency for wealthy white communities to go low carbon by offloading pollution towards poorer black and Latino areas. Of the two north-south highways in Oakland, it is no coincidence that trucks are banned only on the 580, which passes through a more affluent part of the city. Gordon says the goal is environmental equality.</p> <h2>Mexico City</h2> <p>Among air quality wonks and urban planners, perhaps the greatest buzz of excitement is about Mexico City. The Central American megalopolis was named the world\u2019s most polluted capital in 1992, but it has since managed to improve air quality despite the pressures of an extra 5 million inhabitants.</p> <p>Today it has perhaps the most environmentally savvy mayor in the world. <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/07/can-environmental-engineer-poised-become-mayor-fix-mexico-city\">Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo</a>, the first woman to hold the office, is an energy scientist who won the Nobel peace prize in 2007 for her work on the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</p> <p>In a previous stint as the director of the city\u2019s environment department, she oversaw the introduction of the Metrobus, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit\">rapid-transit</a> bus with dedicated lanes. Now she is aiming higher. Last year, she announced a six-year environmental plan, including a 30% cut in air pollution, a 40bn-peso (\u00a31.5bn) modernisation of the metro and a campaign to plant 15m trees. Her government has banned the use of single-use plastic bags and plans to gradually phase out other single-use items, such as straws, cups and balloons.</p> <p>The city\u2019s biggest challenge is traffic. Cars must be off the road for part of the week under the city\u2019s widely replicated Hoy No Circula system, which restricts when vehicles can be on the road based on their number plates. But this has had mixed results because wealthier people simply buy more vehicles to get round the restrictions. The number of vehicles almost doubled between 2006 and 2016, and now account for about 70% of emissions and most nitrogen dioxide pollution in the metropolitan area. Previous administrations have lessened the impact by tightening gasoline standards, expanding monitoring and restricting access to the central corridor in the heart of the city.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"78a4ed1d9dbce060922ab5a42a9c9d35918ef639\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78a4ed1d9dbce060922ab5a42a9c9d35918ef639/0_458_4016_5020/800.jpg\" alt=\"Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo \u2026 the world\u2019s most environmentally sensitive mayor?\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo \u2026 the world\u2019s most environmentally sensitive mayor?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Israel Gutierrez/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are still dreadful smog spikes, particularly when forest fires in the surrounding hills add to exhaust fumes. Last year, the air was so unhealthy that the government closed schools, temporarily banned tens of thousands of cars from the road and forced professional football games to be rescheduled.&nbsp;But, overall, there have been long-term gains. Since 1988, ozone is down 46% and the amount of larger PM10 particles has fallen by 74%, according to Marco Balan, an adviser to the city\u2019s air quality general director. \u201cThe view out of my window has improved,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we have a long way to go.\u201d</p> <p>Sheinbaum wants to go further by raising emissions standards for new vehicles, promoting use of hybrid and electric vehicles and investing more in the metro system, cleaner buses, light railways and cable cars so that people no longer have to rely on informal \u2013 and often dirty and overcrowded \u2013 minivans. Campaigners say a more important step would be to end fuel subsidies. Without that, the cycling scheme, known as EcoBici, will always seem like an afterthought and the Via Verde \u2013 a project to plant vertical gardens on the pillars of elevated roads \u2013 will inevitably be dismissed as window dressing.</p> <p>\u201cMexico City is a stunning example of air quality improvements,\u201d says Chafe. \u201cThey are dealing with it in a holistic way. They know they have many sources and realise it has a huge impact on life expectancy and quality of life. The situation is not perfect, but they have made really impressive progress.\u201d</p> <p>Building on that \u2013 here and elsewhere \u2013 will be the key after lockdown, she says. \u201cWe have seen an improvement in air quality in the past few months. It has been happening for the wrong reasons and in a sad situation. I hope we can now find a way to achieve the same results in a socially fair and feasible way.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 9 June 2020 to clarify that the quote from Jeppe Juul about pedestrians having more space than bikes only applies to some areas of Copenhagen, not the whole city as an earlier version had implied.</p>",

Since lockdown, it has seized<a href=\"https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/millions-of-pounds-and-tonnes-of-drugs-seized-during-lockdown\"> 25 tonnes and \u00a315m in cash</a>,<strong> </strong>which is notably more than during the first three months of the year. \u201cCovid-19 restrictions have made criminal groups take additional risks in moving cash around,\u201d according to an NCA statement. \u201cThe closure of many cash-based businesses in recent weeks has robbed OCGs [organised crime groups] of an opportunity to stash or launder their cash, making it harder for criminals to conceal the proceeds of their crimes.\u201d</p> <p>When it became clear how serious Covid-19 was, there was an immediate drop in the level of organised criminal activity in <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/uk-coronavirus-lockdown-crime-rate-fall-latest-update-a9460846.html\">the UK</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/de/corona-kriminalit\u00e4t-in-der-krise/a-53094260\">Germany</a> and <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2020/05/13/coronavirus-france-records-sharp-drop-in-crime-during-lockdown\">France</a> of around 20%. \u201cCriminals are humans too,\u201d said Graeme Biggar, economic crimes lead at the NCA, \u201cand they are abiding by the rules.\u201d He added that a disproportionately high percentage of the agency\u2019s organised crime targets suffer from underlying medical conditions and are taking self-isolation seriously.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, the first sign that organised crime was adjusting to the new circumstances was to be found on the internet. Online crime has been rising steadily for some years now but Covid-19 is accelerating the trend. Just two weeks into lockdown the NCA reported a huge increase in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-52310804\">Covid-19-related scamming sites</a>: 70,000 sprang up, selling everything from personal protective equipment and hand gel to snake-oil remedies. These goods were either stolen, counterfeit or non-existent, ie simple scams to lure cash from people desperate to protect themselves from the virus.</p> <p>The shift to working from home has placed a strain on IT security teams. A company office will have a well-defined network perimeter that security engineers can monitor easily. At home, employees may be sharing sensitive data with their main system across routers through which their teenagers are downloading dodgy content. This drastically multiplies the vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit to enter a company\u2019s system. This in turn increases the threat from ransomware, malware that can lock computer files and open them only on payment of a ransom.</p> <p>In Italy, where the lockdown was much more rigorously enforced than here, Covid-19 contributed to an unexpected success in the fight against organised crime. On 12 March, police noticed a car driving to an abandoned house near Locri on the Calabrian coast. That evening they spotted the light from a cigarette and <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11175733/wanted-mafia-godfather-busted-coronavirus-lockdown-smoke/\">raided the property</a> to discover 42-year-old Cesare Antonio Cord\u00ec, a senior boss of Calabria\u2019s notorious crime group, the \u2018Ndrangheta, and one of Europe\u2019s most wanted men.</p> <p>Law enforcement officers around the world need no reminding that the initial hiatus in activity was always going to be temporary: major political or economic crises represent a huge opportunity for organised crime. A pandemic with a cataclysmic impact on the global economy is the jackpot. There is massive disruption to supplies of all manner of goods and services both licit and illicit, which leads to dizzying growth in the black market. This in turn generates secondary markets in counterfeit and fake products.</p> <p>This combines with a second catalyst: the resources of the state, including the police, are being diverted to cope with the consequences of the disease. While officers are busy stopping members of the public from congregating in parks, they have less time to track down criminals. Meanwhile, in countries where the state is weak and unable to provide essential goods and services to distressed communities, organised crime will step into the vacuum. There is already plenty of evidence that this is taking place across <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20200502-faced-with-the-covid-19-crisis-the-italian-mafia-sees-business-opportunities\">southern Italy</a>, the favelas of <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/05/latin-american-criminal-gangs-helping-battle-covid-19-outbreaks-200507104108199.html\">Brazil</a> and the extensive territories controlled by the Mexican drugs cartels.</p> <p>The other major activity the major Italian mafias have been engaging in from the start is money-lending. Nicola Gratteri investigates the \u2018Ndrangheta in Calabria. <a href=\"https://www.ansa.it/documents/1587677637600_ItalianConnection.pdf\">Talking to the Global Initiative against Organised Crime</a> last month, he explained that \u201cthe usurers from the \u2018Ndrangheta initially come in with offers of low interest rates, because their end goal is to take over the business, via usury, and use it to launder their illicit proceeds.\u201d It\u2019s a watertight business model because, as Gratteri added: \u201cTheir collateral is the borrower\u2019s life.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/why-mafia-taking-care-of-everyones-business-in-pandemic\">Why the mafia are taking care of everyone's business</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The weakness of state structures is critical for criminals involved in one of the most damaging trades of all, the trafficking in endangered wildlife species. An early theory about the virus was that it originated with pangolins whose meat is illegally sold in Chinese wet markets. A critically endangered species, these weirdly beautiful creatures\u2019 protective scales, made from keratin, are used in traditional Chinese medicine, despite having no pharmaceutical properties. Along with rhino horn (also keratin, just like our finger nails), ivory and tiger bones, hundreds of tons of pangolin scales have been seized by authorities in China, Laos and Vietnam in the past three years.</p> <p>The Wildlife Justice Commission in The Hague, which maintains a remarkable intelligence network tracking the trade, has warned that criminals are stockpiling material and that lockdown is allowing poachers in sub-Saharan Africa a free rein. There is an overwhelming moral and environmental case for a multilateral effort to stifle this business. It is also worth remembering that Ebola, HIV, Sars, H1N1, Mers and Sars-CoV-2 are all reportedly zoonotic diseases, which jumped species because of intense proximity between humans and the original carriers. We must now recognise a hitherto relatively unimportant branch of organised criminal activity has the capacity to bring the entire world to a standstill.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Misha Glenny is the author of McMafia, </em><em>and a Fellow at the Berggruen Institute thinktank</em></p>",

  "<p>The former MP Christopher Brocklebank-Fowler, who has died aged 86, made a singular mark in British political history as the only Conservative MP to cross the floor of the House of Commons and join the emergent Social Democratic party. He did so in dramatic fashion in the vote on the 1981 budget, a few days before the SDP\u2019s official launch, intervening in the debate on Sir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/10/lord-howe-of-aberavon\" title=\"\">Geoffrey Howe</a>\u2019s highly controversial deflationary proposals and then leaving his seat to stride across the chamber to join the former Labour MPs who formed the nucleus of the new party.</p> <p>Citing the edict of his illustrious Norfolk constituency predecessor, the first prime minister Sir Robert Walpole, who asserted that an MP should \u201csay what you think\u201d, Brocklebank-Fowler told the chancellor of the exchequer that the country, industry and the British public deserved a new deal in politics in order to secure stability, national unity and national renewal \u2013 as was planned in the programme of the SDP.</p> <p>\u201cPretty objectionable stuff it was,\u201d the Tory MP and diarist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/sep/08/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">Alan Clark</a> noted sourly about the speech. Although there had been rumours of multiple possible defections, and 34 Conservative MPs rebelled against the Thatcher government in the subsequent vote that night, none would follow Brocklebank-Fowler and team up with the 25 Labour MPs who originally left their party in 1981.</p> <p>Brocklebank-Fowler achieved the further distinction of being a member of four political parties within 15 years \u2013 after the SDP he joined the Liberal Democrats and then, in 1996, signed up for Tony Blair\u2019s vision of the Labour party \u2013 but always maintained that his One Nation political views remained consistent throughout his life.</p> <p>He had considerable justification for this as, even when in the Conservative party, he had been classified as a \u201cwet\u201d, the derisory description <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-political-phenomenon-dies\" title=\"\">Margaret Thatcher</a> used for her own party opponents. \u201cDogger Bank Trawler\u201d, his pleasingly euphonic nickname at Westminster, was derived not only from the fishing area off his Norfolk North West constituency but from the suggestion that he was \u201cso wet you could shoot snipe off him\u201d.</p> <p>His politics were formed partly by his family background, with a provincial, small \u201cl\u201d liberal tradition of surgeons and vicars who could be traced back to the 17th century and by his own lifestyle as a meritocrat who left school at the age of 16 and pursued a successful career in advertising and marketing in the Mad Men decades of the 1960s and 70s. A further huge influence was the three years he spent as a farm manager in Kenya in the late 50s, which gave him an abiding concern and interest in overseas development, the problems of postcolonialism and national self-determination.</p> <p>He was a charming and convivial companion who was popular at Westminster during his 13 years in the Commons, although not among his former Tory colleagues after his defection. He never regretted his move, which he regarded as the most honourable political decision of his career, and his courage was commended, privately, by some Tories. It was also publicly recognised by David Owen, the former foreign secretary with whom he was initially allied in the SDP and who acknowledged the extent to which Brocklebank-Fowler was ostracised by some of his commercial clients as a consequence of his perceived apostasy.</p> <p>Christopher was the second son of Sidney Brocklebank-Fowler, a solicitor in Leicestershire, and his wife Iris (nee Beechey). He grew up initially on the west coast of Scotland, where he went to primary school. When the family moved to Cambridge, he attended the Perse school. He played rugby, cricket and soccer, competed at county level in Cambridgeshire over 10,000 yards and was a county youth swimming champion. He was a farm pupil in East Anglia between 1950 and 1955, interrupted for national service as a submarine officer in the Royal Navy between 1952 and 1954.</p> <p>He secured a diploma in agriculture by correspondence course in 1952 and arrived in Kenya in 1955 during the Mau Mau uprising against British rule. He returned to the UK in 1957 and spent two years with Unilever before moving into advertising.</p> <p>Actively involved in politics at this time, Brocklebank-Fowler stood unsuccessfully as the Conservative candidate in West Ham North in the 1964 general election. In the 1970 general election he was selected for the marginal Labour-held seat of King\u2019s Lynn. He won it by 33 votes and when the constituency was abolished under boundary revision in February 1974 was adopted for the successor seat of Norfolk North West where he steadily consolidated his majority.</p> <p>In 1983, however, in common with many other founder MPs of the SDP, he lost his seat, which went to the Conservative Henry Bellingham by a majority of just over 3,000. He stood again as an SDP candidate in Norfolk North West in 1987, losing by over three times as many votes and then in 1992 he stood as a Liberal Democrat in South Norfolk, coming second, but 17,000 votes behind the Conservative cabinet minister John MacGregor.</p> <p>Brocklebank-Fowler was married and divorced three times. He was wed first in 1957 to Joan Nowland, an Australian public relations executive. After their divorce in 1975, he married Mary Berry, from whom he was divorced in 1986. From 1996 to 2000 he was married to Dorothea Rycroft.</p> <p>On retirement, in 2005 he moved to Caithness on the recommendation of his friend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/19/lord-maclennan-of-rogart-obituary\" title=\"\">Lord (Robert) Maclennan of Robart</a>. He took a job as a river keeper on the River Forss, increased the salmon take from 32 to 530 in the course of six years and was proud of the consequent employment his efforts brought to the area. </p> <p>He is survived by the two sons of his first marriage, Simon and Timothy.</p> <p> \u2022 Christopher Brocklebank-Fowler, politician, born 13 January 1934; died 29 May 2020</p>",

According to the Office for National Statistics, black babies have a 121% increased risk of being stillborn and a 50% increased risk of dying within 28 days of birth compared with white babies. Brathwaite has since received apologies from hospital staff for the long list of \u201cinconsistencies\u201d and dismissive behaviour that \u201cfell far below\u201d the NHS standard, but her experience of feeling&nbsp;\u201cinvisible\u201d or, at best, an aggressive nuisance is clearly not isolated.</p> <p>She remains angry. \u201cMy therapist says that when babies are born, they have these tiny synapses where they\u2019re looking for their mum and if they can\u2019t smell you, they break apart and never go back together, so Esm\u00e9\u2019s always going to pine for me. That makes me so furious, because that separation could have been avoided.\u201d However, she says, she now has a purpose: \u201cI\u2019m at the forefront of a discussion that will hopefully save women\u2019s lives.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Part memoir, part manifesto, Brathwaite\u2019s book was written to help \u201cblack British mothers feel validated and encouraged to take up space\u201d. In recent years, social media stars with handles like \u201cVegan Earth Mother\u201d or \u201cSlummy Mummy\u201d have helped create a \u201cbeige\u201d image of motherhood, Brathwaite says, a land of \u201cglossy women\u201d who seem unnaturally happy to be \u201cspending their days breastfeeding or pureeing organic vegetables into ice-cream trays\u201d.</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t just mean beige \u201cin terms of skin tone but in personality, in performance, in content being rolled out\u201d. When she started her blog in 2016, \u201cthere was no other version out there. If you weren\u2019t white and middle-class with this certain set of mummy friends, it just felt like you were sitting on the outskirts looking in.\u201d</p> <p>The book\u2019s title is an attempt to dismantle (not reclaim) the term \u201cbaby-mother\u201d \u2013 which dates back to the 1960s and is often cast upon single black mothers. It\u2019s not simply written through the perspective of a black woman but someone from a working-class background with an unconventional upbringing. Brathwaite is the eldest of three children brought up by her maternal grandparents (who came here from Barbados as part of the Windrush generation), though it was her beloved grandfather \u2013 blinded in one eye after a mugging and no longer able to work \u2013 who did the bulk of the childcare and domestic tasks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B9CCEmTp3mb/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

So many authors came up to speak and I felt butterflies in my tummy even thinking about being on the other end of this machine. I nudged @livvithomas in the ribs and I said \u2018Mate, one day I\u2019m going to talk about my book at a sales conference.\u2019 And she laughed but agreed, \u2018yes you will.\u2019 And today that dream came true. It is so trippy actually living my dream.

Brathwaite remained close to her father until she was 21, when he died suddenly of the common flu. He had gone to hospital, put up a fight to be seen and then, suffering from sepsis, went into cardiac arrest. All of which makes the Covid-19 crisis particularly sobering for her, she says. \u201cHaving the news pour in on my iPad has made me see that black people really need to work on protecting themselves, because we just see these black bodies piling up.\u201d Her hope is that data around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/british-bame-covid-19-death-rate-more-than-twice-that-of-whites\">BAME deaths during the pandemic</a> will ultimately create a domino effect as health inequalities become impossible to ignore.</p> <p>But <em>I Am Not Your Baby Mother </em>resonates beyond race \u2013 and should strike a chord with any mother alienated by stereotypical images of motherhood. When Brathwaite first became a mother, she was more worried about paying the electricity bill than whether her child\u2019s food was organic. \u201cIf my child is not crying through hunger, I\u2019m winning. The time to fuss is itself a privilege.\u201d</p> <p>While the lack of diversity in images of motherhood might look like carelessness or complacency, you don\u2019t have to scratch too deep to detect uglier impulses. We discuss why Michelle Obama was so successful at projecting an image of black, middle-class motherhood but Meghan Markle has been attacked on everything from how she cradled her bump to how long she leaves her son with a nanny. \u201cWhat spun Britain through a loop was seeing Meghan\u2019s mum at that wedding. It was like: \u2018Woah, that is a black, black lady with locs\u2019\u2026 people are outraged that she has brought a dollop of melanin into the royal family!\u201d</p> <p>Brathwaite has also experienced direct hostility from the mumosphere. Last year it emerged that she had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/11/instagram-influencer-clemmie-hooper-secret-account-critics\">among those attacked by</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/11/instagram-influencer-clemmie-hooper-secret-account-critics\"> a </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/11/instagram-influencer-clemmie-hooper-secret-account-critics\">secret account</a> created by midwife and reigning queen of the mumfluencers, Clemmie Hooper (AKA Mother of Daughters). Hooper accused Brathwaite \u2013 whom she had previously invited on to her podcast \u2013 of being aggressive and weaponising race (Hooper has since apologised).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"333cece828962b477809b11c485676620d8900b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/333cece828962b477809b11c485676620d8900b5/0_0_472_590/400.jpg\" alt=\"Clemmie Hooper with her partner Simon Hooper, also an Instagram influencer.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clemmie Hooper with her partner Simon Hooper, also an Instagram influencer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThat really came at me from behind,\u201d Brathwaite recalls. \u201cI had to tell myself: \u2018Wow girl, get it together, not everyone is your friend.\u2019 But what she decided to do has actually been helpful to me showing people the many things black women are dealing with, not just online but in the office and on the street.\u201d Of all the social media apps, she has most confidence in Instagram, which she insists has the best processes to protect users. </p> <p>Brathwaite and her husband, who works in the tool hire industry, now live in a house bought&nbsp;in part&nbsp;thanks to endorsements&nbsp;and sponsorships. But while she is reluctant to see herself as a role model, the responsibility for speaking to mothers on a lower income clearly plays on her mind. \u201cWhen we tell people to relax their spending at, say, Primark or H&amp;M, we have to be conscious that someone\u2019s \u2018fast fashion\u2019 is someone else\u2019s \u2018high-end\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless she is unabashed about her own material aspirations. She studies idols like Serena Williams, Beyonc\u00e9 and Michelle Obama and is fluent in the language of influence and markets. \u201cI\u2019ve always said: \u2018I\u2019m just here to stack my chips, I don\u2019t know what you guys are on,\u2019\u201d she laughs.</p> <p>\u201cAs this pandemic has shown, anyone\u2019s financial situation can change at any time. Just because we [may attempt to] buy our way out of our blackness, it doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s a solid thing... using the extreme example of police brutality, no racist cop is asking to see your bank balance before they shoot you. No one is saying: \u2018What are you worth, where do you eat, where does your kid go to school?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Financial security for black people may well be \u201ca comfort blanket\u201d, she says, but \u201cit\u2019s a blanket I can\u2019t afford to let go of, because I don\u2019t have anything else\u201d.</p> <p>Still, she insists she doesn\u2019t want to be the product for ever. She has established the platform <a href=\"https://www.makemotherhooddiverse.com/\">Make Motherhood Diverse</a> to shine a light on images of motherhood beyond the white, middle-class and able-bodied \u2013 and her hope is that soon black fatherhood will have its turn in the spotlight. She is \u201cvery purposeful\u201d in showing her husband in a domestic setting, sharing \u201csoft moments\u201d with their son. \u201cI want everyone to know \u2013 but specifically the black community \u2013 I am with a guy who really supports my public career. It\u2019s not something that is typical. Being with him makes me giggle because I realise I\u2019ve just ended up with my grandad \u2013 it\u2019s really, really funny.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>A week after we speak, America is in crisis after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">the killing of George Floyd</a>. Brathwaite is posting a lot about racial injustice and has gained 20,000 followers over a weekend. When I catch up with her over email, her anger about black people \u201cbeing killed for nothing more than being black\u201d is tinged with a sense of hope: \u201cI do think it\u2019s a turning point. There is something about this murder that has made the entire world sit up and listen.\u201d When I ask if she will be joining the protests planned in the UK, she says she thinks she will: \u201cIt will be the first time I\u2019ve been out since lockdown but if there is any time that venturing out is worth any kind of risk, it is now.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022&nbsp;<em>I Am Not Your Baby Mother</em>&nbsp;by Candice Brathwaite is published by Quercus (\u00a316.99).

Just a few months ago, he was painting the Democrats as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/01/trump-conservatives-socialism-bernie-sanders-politics\">radical socialists</a> in thrall to Senator Bernie Sanders, but the party\u2019s nomination was secured by the moderate Joe Biden. He was also trumpeting the strength of the economy, but that narrative was shredded by the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 although there was some encouraging news at the end of last week to suggest that US jobs were returning after the lockdown was lifted in many states.</p> <p>Trump pivoted to blaming China for the virus but polls suggested this gained little traction as voters scrutinised the president\u2019s own sluggish response. But then came the tragedy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd,</a> an African American man killed when a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his neck with his knee. The subsequent social unrest, the most widespread in half a century, may now have thrown Trump a political lifeline.</p> <p>The great majority of the protests, including that outside the White House on Monday, have been peaceful, highlighting the injustices of 400 years of slavery and segregation. Some have been met with vicious state-sanctioned force. However, incidents of violence, including ransacking stores and burning police cars, received outsized TV coverage and handed Trump a cultural wedge issue to exploit.</p> <p>Mandy Jenkins, a journalist, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mjenkins/status/1268558449098526721?s=20\">tweeted on Thursday:</a> \u201cMy friends and family in rural Ohio honestly believe large swaths of America\u2019s cities are being destroyed by lawless bands of looters who are the same people that are protesting.

If you are a liberal and you\u2019re worried about this working against Biden, then 71 and 72 are the years that give you nightmares.\u201d</p> <p>Nixon and Trump came from very different starting points, however.

  "<p>In the middle of a pandemic that is killing inordinate numbers of black people, many have been grieving the lives of George Floyd, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">Breonna Taylor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery\">Ahmaud Arbery</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/david-mcatee-louisville-protests-family\">David McAtee</a> and many others, while living with the realities of Covid-19. That George Floyd lived through coronavirus to then be killed by police who cut off his oxygen is a cruel irony. Yet his death makes it clear that we cannot separate the pandemic from police violence because they are both driven by the same thing \u2013 white supremacy.</p> <p>Since the long hot summer of 1967, when more than 150 rebellions ripped across the country, there have been various calls for reform, changes that were supposed to make the lives of black people better. In each instance, those lives have not been improved by these processes and often undelivered promises.&nbsp;</p> <p>Body cameras, non-lethal weapons, increasing the diversity of police forces and the like were all heralded as changing the face of policing. But they all only changed the <em>techniques</em>. Instead of making officers act more responsibly, we know that body cameras can be turned on and off and cops continue to brutalise the public they purportedly serve.</p> <p>Therefore, reforming a clearly broken system will not do much to keep black people from dying in the streets. In the last week or so, people have continued to be brutalised and killed by police while protesting against that very thing \u2013 police violence.&nbsp;</p> <p>This pain people are witnessing now occurs in so many facets of black lives, but we don\u2019t see black stories as part of the collective narrative of the US. While the racism that black bodies are made to endure might seem localised, the marginalisation, expulsion and exclusion black people experience have consequences for other communities.&nbsp;</p> <p>The \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, launched under Richard Nixon, was escalated in the mid-1980s to address the so-called crack epidemic. In very short order, crack cocaine became linked to \u201curban\u201d crime. The racialisation of the drug made black people the face of addiction and led to calls for more severe punishment for possession of crack. As a result of moral panics over \u201ccrack babies\u201d and other such nonsense, we saw harsher punishment for crack versus powder cocaine possession and calls for mandatory minimum sentences that increased incarceration rates for black people.</p> <p>It was not until the opioid epidemic hit rural and suburban white America that cries to see drug addiction as an \u201cillness\u201d were heeded. Some who saw the ravages of opioid addiction were calling for drug treatment, rather than the prison cell they advocated for others. In short, the drugs that had claimed so many black lives came for white people \u2013 with different responses.&nbsp;</p> <p>And yet here we are again. Right now in the US, Senator Rand Paul is obstructing the passage of a bill that would make lynching a federal crime after more than a century of advocacy. The journalist and activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/27/ida-b-wells-civil-rights-movement-reporter\">Ida B Wells-Barnett</a> described lynching in 1909 as a \u201ccolour line-murder\u201d and, most importantly, \u201ca national crime and requires a national remedy\u201d. She said what too few in Congress appreciate today \u2013 the death of black people by legal and extra-legal means is \u201ca blight upon our nation\u201d.</p> <p>More than a century later, black people still cannot get the US government to recognise our pains. The reason George Floyd and so many others are dead is because they are black. And being black in my country is treated, by some police officers and vigilantes alike, as probable cause to harass, detain and kill.</p> <p>Consider black people as canaries in the coal mine. What happens to them in this country matters for everyone. Those who would seek to raise the canard of black on black crime as a riposte to the charges of systemic racism in this country have not been paying attention. And focusing on the deaths of those harmed at the hands of the police ignores the many violences black people experience on a daily basis in the US. Forget the term \u201cmicro-aggressions\u201d \u2013 let\u2019s call them \u201cmacroaggressive\u201d. It\u2019s probably not going to be the Knight Rider at your door, but maybe the other \u201cgood\u201d white people who come armed with guns demanding to search your home.</p> <p>Yet black people are made to feel ashamed for saying they have been victims. To be a victim simply means that you have been harmed by the actions of another. Yet black people have been told over and over again that the mere mention of racism is unfair. They\u2019re playing the \u201crace card\u201d or adopting a loser\u2019s mentality.</p> <p>That\u2019s a myth we tell so that black people don\u2019t dwell on the many ways they have been damaged. This is not unique to the US. But acknowledging black pain, our pain, is seen as some sort of weakness or loss of control rather than one of the things we must confront if we are to imagine ways to repair these harms.</p> <p>I don\u2019t want black people to simply survive this moment - I want them to thrive. So far, we have been surviving and it\u2019s not served black people well and it\u2019s certainly not served my country well.&nbsp;</p> <p>The US needs robust, systemic change and we will not get there by pretending we have not been building up to this moment as long as we have been a country.&nbsp;</p> <p>It is a nation founded on theft and it\u2019s payback time. It is always the right time to do the right thing.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><p>Niambi Michele Carter is the author of American While Black and is associate professor of political science at Howard University</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>The life of my father, Benny Pollack, who has died aged 78, was marked by his experience of exile and his strong secular Jewish identity.</p> <p>Like many of his peers, Benny was part of the social and political mobilisations that exploded in his native Chile in the late 1960s. When the socialist Salvador Allende was elected president in 1970, Benny joined the government as a member of Chile\u2019s UN delegation and as an adviser to the foreign minister.</p> <p>In September 1973, his hopes for the creation of a democratic and socialist Chile were shattered with the violent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1973/sep/12/chile.fromthearchive1\">overthrow of Allende</a> in a military coup. Like hundreds of thousands of his fellow citizens, he was forced into exile. His Chilean citizenship was revoked, and he would not return for another 15 years.</p> <p>When the socialist Ricardo Lagos became president of Chile in 2000, he appointed Benny ambassador to China, a post he held from 2001 to 2004. Although he was not one for pomp and ceremony, this was an immensely proud moment for Benny.</p> <p>He was the son of Nahum Pollack and Graciela (nee Eskenazi), Jewish immigrant shopkeepers, who had settled in the remote town of Copiap\u00f3, in the Atacama desert.&nbsp;Benny was political through and through and his activism, first in the Radical and then the Socialist parties, began in his early teens. When he won a place at university at 16 to study law (he later transferred to the journalism course), the whole family moved with him to Santiago, where he met Gloria Fajnsztejn, whom he married in 1965. They had three sons, Ricardo, Claudio and me.</p> <p>Offered sanctuary in the UK in 1973, our family settled at first in the Essex village of Abberton, which could not have been more different to the Chilean capital. We moved to Liverpool in 1975 when Benny was offered a teaching post in the department of politics at the University of Liverpool. A gregarious and passionate teacher, Benny was a popular member of staff and would stay in touch with many of the students he inspired. His academic achievements, including books on Spanish and Chilean politics, saw him promoted to professor of Latin American politics.</p> <p>He never let his children, growing up in Liverpool, forget our history, both as progressives and Jews. His stories were laced with anecdotes of camaraderie, chicanery, all-night political meetings and daybreak visits to the local market to eat strange concoctions of raw seafood to halt a hangover.</p> <p>Benny was a compassionate man with an unlimited curiosity in people, from all walks of life.&nbsp;One of his greatest joys in retirement was his grandchildren, who knew him as <em>Tata</em>.</p> <p>He is survived by Gloria, his sons and seven grandchildren, and by his sister, Molly.</p>",
  "<p>My friend Lynn Gillis, who has died aged 96, was founding head in 1962 of the department of psychiatry and mental health at the University of Cape Town and played an integral role in changing the custodial care to a comprehensive service for the region.</p> <p>He initiated groundbreaking community services and clinics, unusually led by nurses. Under his guidance a day hospital was established, and a psychiatric social club promoting continuity of care for patients in the community, with outreach provisions to destigmatise mental illness. At Valkenberg hospital and Alexandra rehabilitation centre he courageously defied apartheid segregation by integrating staff across wards.&nbsp;</p> <p>Lynn was born to emigrant parents in Kroonstad, South Africa, a small town where his father, Julius, a dentist, grew competition prize roses as a hobby, and his mother, Annie (nee Lynn), a concert pianist, gave music lessons. This parochial background grounded Lynn\u2019s fluent vernacular Afrikaans, a language he deemed second only to Yiddish in its rich array of metaphors and colourful curses. Perhaps too it underpinned his initiatives in community and social psychiatry. Similarly, a spell in the Johannesburg children\u2019s fever hospital aged nine for scarlet fever primed later innovative ideas.&nbsp;</p> <p>When the second world war broke out, he served in makeshift hospitals in northern Africa and Italy. Between 1945 and 1962 he worked at Tara hospital, a pioneering mental health facility in Johannesburg, taking a break in the 1950s to hold positions at the Maudsley hospital in London, and becoming a founding member of the Royal College of Psychiatry.</p> <p>These formative experiences bore fruit when he was recruited in 1962 to fill the position of head of department of psychiatry and mental health at the University of Cape Town and first consultant at Groote Schur hospital. He remained professor of psychiatry at the university until his retirement in 1989, when he became professor emeritus. </p> <p>Lynn won many awards and held esteemed positions, among them president of the SA National Council for Mental Health. He and I met in 1980 when as director of the South African Medical Research Council\u2019s Clinical Psychiatry Research Unit he invited my husband, Julian Leff, of the British Medical Research Council Social and Community Psychiatry Unit, to participate in an extensive study of life events and ongoing precipitants of relapses in schizophrenia. Their findings revealed massive discrepancies in the different racial groups\u2019 lived experience. We have remained fast friends since, with reciprocal annual visits between ourselves and Lynn and his wife, Shirley.</p> <p>As inspirational teacher, mentor and author of numerous professional books and publications, Lynn\u2019s many eminent trainees acknowledge his singular trusting style of leadership, which encouraged personal initiative.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ever curious, Lynn was drawn to psychoanalysis, and in retirement pursued Buddhism, studied sculpture and created austere carvings in marble and rare woods. An avid mountaineer, he remained remarkably&nbsp;healthy and agile, lucid and fiercely independent to the end of his full and fulfilled professional and artistic life.&nbsp;</p> <p>Shirley (nee Lurie), whom he married in 1950, died in 2015. Lynn is survived by their daughter, Jenny, four grandchildren, Josh, Gabrielle, Jason and Danielle, and three great-grandchildren, Nomi, Yael and Lev.<br></p>",

Taking risks is really important. I\u2019m interested in the things that give a kind of joy and maybe disrupt things. I am interested in pushing boundaries. Anything that does that is good.\u201d</p> <p>Wigglesworth \u2013 who was appointed MBE in 2004 and became the first woman to receive the <a href=\"https://www.thersa.org/about-us/royal-designers-for-industry\" title=\"\">Royal Designer for Industry</a> award for architecture in 2012 \u2013 is describing herself, but she could easily be talking about how she designed her home in north London. <a href=\"https://www.swarch.co.uk/work/stock-orchard-street/\" title=\"\">9/10 Stock Orchard Street</a> is the multi-award-winning live/work space of Wigglesworth and her partner, <a href=\"http://www.jeremytill.net/about\" title=\"\">Jeremy Till</a>. Built 20 years ago, the \u201cstraw bale house\u201d, as it was invariably called, instigated a debate about the aesthetics of eco-architecture. \u201cAt that time,\u201d Wigglesworth recalls, \u201cthe green movement was about dropping out to north Wales or somewhere and building something quite vernacular with your hands. We wanted to make an urbane version of that, in an urban setting.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There have been two Grand Designs 'revisits' and 9/10 Stock Orchard Street remains 'one of Kevin\u2019s favourites'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a practice, Sarah Wigglesworth Architects (SWA) has since become renowned for its life-enhancing public buildings, including social housing, schools and community centres. However, during the two-year Stock Orchard Street build, the practice almost folded, so all-consuming was the work. The couple had sold their home and, for nine months, Wigglesworth lived on-site in a caravan. (\u201cIn the spring and summer, it felt like a holiday camp, but by winter it was damp and miserable.\u201d) Till \u2013 who is now head of Central St Martins and pro vice-chancellor of University of the Arts London \u2013 spent his weeks up north as the head of the school of architecture at Sheffield University. Wigglesworth was appointed to Sheffield at the same time (she was a professor of architecture there until 2016) but took a sabbatical to concentrate on the project.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4db5a1f49695a324fe37849c9ad44b7a509b0a71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4db5a1f49695a324fe37849c9ad44b7a509b0a71/0_1292_4632_5783/801.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Wigglesworth leans against the limewashed pantry, a central area that separates the kitchen from the living space.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Wigglesworth leans against the limewashed pantry, a central area that separates the kitchen from the living space.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gilbert McGarragher/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The L-shaped building is situated at the end of a short residential road. On one side is a row of semi-detached, Victorian villas, on the other a busy railway track that slopes towards King\u2019s Cross. The couple bought the plot at auction in the mid-90s. At the time, it was a working forge: part-gas furnace, part-junkyard. It wasn\u2019t until the site was cleared that they realised just how large it was. </p> <p>At the same time, they had regular visits from a film crew: their straw bale house featured in the first series of <em>Grand Designs</em>. Ten minutes into that episode, Wigglesworth tells presenter Kevin McCloud: \u201cIn a way, I don\u2019t really care what the outcome is: I just want to build it.\u201d She feels now that the technical aspects of the build weren\u2019t fully showcased; that she and Till were \u201cactors in a drama\u201d. \u201cThe production company understood TV, but they weren\u2019t familiar with the complexities of getting a building out of the ground,\u201d she says. The project was delayed, so the producers introduced a distracting subplot in which McCloud builds his own rural, straw bale cabin. That said, there have since been two \u201crevisits\u201d and 9/10 Stock Orchard Street remains \u201cone of Kevin\u2019s favourites\u201d.</p> <p>When it was finished, the editor of the <em><a href=\"https://www.architectural-review.com/\" title=\"\">Architectural Review</a></em>, Peter Davey, called the straw-bale house \u201cthe most sexy and witty building I have seen for years\u201d. He predicted that it \u201cwill be seen as one of the most gallant experiments in eco-architecture of our age\u201d. He was right.</p> <p>To enter 9/10 Stock Orchard Street, you pass through a fence of woven willow and galvanised steel. This opens on to a series of vertical gabions (\u201ccages\u201d filled with lumps of recycled concrete). These piers support the office wing, which is clad on one wall with weathered sandbags, filled with cement and lime, which absorb the rumble from the adjacent railway line (the inspiration was a photo of Swansea\u2019s plate-glass-windowed <a href=\" https://www.kardomahcafe.com/\" title=\"\">Kardomah coffee house</a> during the blitz). Above the office door, the facade is swaddled in silicone-faced fibreglass \u2013 a kind of wipe-clean quilt, which is \u201cbuttoned\u201d to the structure of the building.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1d54d4dc0665ce8c321f5667d4a4cc471475f50d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d54d4dc0665ce8c321f5667d4a4cc471475f50d/0_0_7157_9442/758.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Wigglesworth\u2019s home is connected to the office via a double-height conference/dining room.\u2019\" width=\"758\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Wigglesworth\u2019s home is connected to the office via a double-height conference/dining room.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gilbert McGarragher/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wigglesworth\u2019s home is connected to the office via a double-height conference/dining room. The dining table is pivotal for Wigglesworth. Her drawing, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/shop/the-disorder-of-the-dining-table-print-limited-edition.html\" title=\"\">The Disorder of the Dining Table</a>\u201d, is an exploration of order and control in architecture. It depicts three dining tables in various states of use: before a dinner party, with chairs tucked in and places set; during, a scribble of movement; and after, a mess of crumpled napkins and abandoned plates. Wigglesworth calls the drawing a \u201cpost-rationalisation of the idea that we were fighting very hard against: this concept of the perfect product\u201d. For Wigglesworth, the rituals of eating are analogous to the rituals of domestic life. \u201cWe were designing this in the mid-to-late 90s, when sheer glass and very minimal interiors were the sort of gold standard of architectural homes. But we wanted the mess, we wanted the dirt \u2013 we wanted our home to be able to accept all the spills of everyday life.\u201d</p> <p>The conference/dining room connects to the living space via a sliding door made from heavily patterned douglas fir. The reveal is dramatic \u2013 like a sheet falling off a sculpture. The space Wigglesworth has created for the scribbles and spills of everyday life is full of light, texture and colour \u2013 but mostly, it is full of ideas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"faafc55857baefc8fdca462494be34c7108e2736\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/faafc55857baefc8fdca462494be34c7108e2736/0_0_7317_4390/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The weathered sandbag wall was inspired by a photograph from the blitz and functions as an acoustic absorber\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The weathered sandbag wall was inspired by a photograph from the blitz and functions as an acoustic absorber.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gilbert McGarragher/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The steel-and-timber structure of the living and sleeping quarters has been insulated with 550 barley straw bales. These are covered by sheets of corrugated, galvanised steel on the outside, and rendered with lime plaster on the inside. On one facade, the steel has been replaced by sheets of clear polycarbonate, revealing a glimpse of the insulative straw bales, which, 20 years on, are as golden as the day they were first laid. (Unlike the polycarbonate sheets, which are cracked and taped together in parts.)</p> <p>A \u201csummer ventilation strategy\u201d has also been incorporated into the design. On warm days, a series of louvres in the lobby can be opened. These draw cool air into the building, while hot air is pulled out through another louvre system at the top of a five-storey tower, the couples\u2019 library and creative \u201ceyrie\u201d. The larder \u2013 a central area of cool that looks like a giant anthill \u2013 separates the living space from the kitchen. It functions in much the same way, with vents at the top and bottom. \u201cOne of the things we were unpacking was this idea about re-learning technologies,\u201d says Wigglesworth. \u201cOf course, now we have fridges, but there are ways of keeping food cool without recourse to energy.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Your home should be treated as if it were a part of your body \u2013 which in a way, it is \u2026 You need to look after it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Wigglesworth was thinking about gender when she decided to make a combined conference and dining room. \u201cI have always been really interested in the idea of \u2018women\u2019s work\u2019 and what it means to be the worker \u2013 to be the proprietress of an office at the same time as being the homeowner and the homemaker. To my mind, there\u2019s very little distinction [\u2026] Everything is happening at the same time, even in your brain.\u201d</p> <p>In 2020, SWA marks its 25th anniversary, with an exhibition planned for later this year to celebrate this landmark. For the show, each studio member will present a piece of work made in response to some of SWA\u2019s most memorable projects. For Wigglesworth, the exhibition is a way of \u201cstepping back\u201d and \u201cdemocratically reflecting\u201d upon the themes in architecture during those years.</p> <p>Gender inequality in architecture is one of those recurrent themes. In the mid-90s, Wigglesworth co-curated an exhibition, symposium and accompanying book called <em><a href=\"https://www.betterworldbooks.com/product/detail/desiring-practices-architecture-gender-and-the-interdisciplinary-0952177390\" title=\"\">Desiring Practices: Architecture, Gender and the Interdisciplinary</a></em>. Twenty five years later, the issue \u201chas come round again\u201d. Today, Wigglesworth is a member of <a href=\"https://www.part-w.com/\" title=\"\">Part W</a>, an action group of women \u201ccalling out gender discrimination in an industry that routinely excludes\u201d. Wigglesworth says: \u201cI sometimes go to meetings with a younger male colleague, in which I will ask the questions, and the person I\u2019m addressing will answer my young, male colleague. I find that almost unbelievable, but that still happens.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2863022c91da3b5fc7f1c06dd6661e8e850f4080\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2863022c91da3b5fc7f1c06dd6661e8e850f4080/0_0_7324_9619/761.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The proof of the thing is in the building of it, and the experiencing of it.\u2019\" width=\"761\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The proof of the thing is in the building of it, and the experiencing of it.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gilbert McGarragher/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/24/foundation-stone-leading-architects-homes-shaped-them\">Foundation stone: leading architects on the homes that shaped them</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For their first campaign, Part W drew attention to the fact that, since 1848, the Riba <a href=\"https://www.architecture.com/awards-and-competitions-landing-page/awards/royal-gold-medal\" title=\"\">Royal Gold Medal</a> had been awarded to just one woman in her own right. By crowd-sourcing an alternative list of women who have been overlooked for the medal, they highlighted how female architects have been routinely underacknowledged. This year\u2019s award went to Part W\u2019s co-founders: Grafton Architects. The organisation is also interested in ensuring women\u2019s viewpoints are given equal representation in education, histories of architecture and speaking platforms (\u201cthere are too many \u2018manels\u2019\u201d). \u201cFor too long, bodies that are responsible for creating the discourse, and that represent the industry, have not paid enough attention to doing this,\u201d says Wigglesworth.</p> <p>In the 20 years since 9/10 Stock Orchard Street was built, the green movement has evolved. Building regulations have changed and techniques for analysing energy efficiency have improved. Wigglesworth\u2019s timber windows had warped and part of the roof will not stop leaking. (\u201cI shouldn\u2019t tell you that, should I?

They pored over energy bills, measured the U-values of the building fabric (how effectively their sandbags, steel and straw act as insulators), and fed the data into Passivhaus software to determine the energy efficiency of the building. The research highlighted areas that needed rethinking. For Wigglesworth, the work that ensued is a continuation of their initial concept: \u201cIt is part of sustainability, this idea that buildings are cherished. Your home should be treated as if it were a part of your body \u2013 which in a way, it is. It is a kind of bigger expression of yourself, and you need to look after it.\u201d</p> <p>Now they have reinsulated and re-rendered the large glass wall in the living space and the \u201cundercroft\u201d (the area underneath the raised, open-plan living space). The warped timber windows have been replaced and a section of polycarbonate roof has been replaced with rooflights and blackout blinds. And, \u201cafter much discussion\u201d, a new boiler has been fitted. \u201cWe were wondering if we should put an air-source heat pump in,\u201d says Wigglesworth. \u201cBut we decided not to on the basis that, by the time this needs replacing in 20 years, the technology will have improved massively.\u201d (Already, she is thinking of the next renovation.)</p> <p>They have removed a wall between the tower and the living area, so losing a redundant corridor. The floor has been replaced with engineered, oiled oak, the window frames painted in either green or blue, and the walls and woodwork in gloriously off-kilter shades of coral pink and pale lilac (\u201cI\u2019m not very good at colour,\u201d she confides. \u201cI find it really, really hard.\u201d)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1c54355ac2322d7149ab47f11d952a2691681607\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c54355ac2322d7149ab47f11d952a2691681607/0_0_8834_13069/676.jpg\" alt=\"To enter 9/10 Stock Orchard Street, you pass through a fence made of woven willow and galvanised steel.\" width=\"676\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">To enter 9/10 Stock Orchard Street, you pass through a fence made of woven willow and galvanised steel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gilbert McGarragher/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the end of that episode of <em>Grand Designs</em>, Wigglesworth tells McCloud: \u201cI\u2019ve always seen this house as something of a plaything for us architects [\u2026] You can test an idea on paper ,\u201d she says, \u201cbut the proof of the thing is in the building of it, and the experiencing of it and the living of that life.\u201d</p> <p>At the age of 62, Wigglesworth has \u2013 alongside improving energy efficiency \u2013 made the building more age-friendly. The composting toilet has been decommissioned (\u201cI don\u2019t want to be maintaining that when I\u2019m 80\u201d), helping create room for a self-contained annex on the ground floor, which may, some day, be lived in by a carer. In the kitchen, gas rings have been replaced with an induction hob and an eye-level oven. Accessible drawers have been installed. There are even handrails on the bath. Will she be OK to use the five-storey tower, I ask, as we ascend the bright red, book-lined staircase. \u201cAs a musculoskeletal organism, you need to keep moving,\u201d is her pragmatic response.</p>",
  "<p>Hundreds of thousands of Americans took to the streets, in big cities and small towns, from coast to coast, marking one of the the most expansive mobilizations yet in the nationwide protests against police violence and systemic racism sparked by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.</p> \n<p>Demonstrations, now in their second weekend, were largely peaceful \u2013 and included moments of levity and jubilance.

Some of them&nbsp;remembered the old saw that anarchy is only three missed meals away.&nbsp;</p> <p>That ugly scenario, which would have added civil disorder to killer contagion, was avoided because supply chains have been protected. Cargo ships and lorry drivers have continued to make deliveries from our neighbours in Europe.

For the same reason, the new 14-day quarantine rule that the government is imposing on travellers will not be applied to those hauling goods.</p> <p>Tariff-free and frictionless trade have played vital roles in enduring this emergency. And thanks for that is due to Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union. I doubt you will ever get anyone from Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexiter government to acknowledge this, but the EU helped to prevent the crisis from becoming even more diabolical. Though the UK formally left at the end of January, this made little practical difference to trade because we entered a&nbsp;transition period during which Britain has continued to enjoy the benefits of the single market.</p> <p>We cannot know when the coronavirus will go away. We do know that the transition expires at the end of this year. If there\u2019s no trade deal with the EU by then, Britain will be hurled into 2021 with price-inflating duties on imports, serious burdens on exporters and friction-heavy checks at borders. Brexit ultras are trying to make that sound like a benign scenario by rebadging it as an <a href=\"https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/reports/the-australian-points-based-system-what-is-it-and-what-would-its-impact-be-in-the-uk/\">\u201cAustralian-style\u201d outcome</a>, but this would be no picnic on Bondi beach.</p> <p>The CBI says that the coronavirus has left companies with \u201calmost zero\u201d resilience to a chaotic exit from the single market. Most analysis suggests that the hardest hit regions would be those where many voted Tory for the first time in 2019. Nissan <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/nissan-sunderland-plant-brexit-trade-deal-uk-eu-a9545851.html\">has just warned</a> that it could not guarantee the future of its car plant in Sunderland. The Bank of England is telling financial institutions to be prepared. The <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52304821\">International Monetary Fund</a> estimates that a no-deal Brexit would compound the coronavirus havoc by inflicting further scarring on the economy and a permanent loss of 5% of GDP. For many companies fighting to keep their heads above water in a virus-induced recession, a crash-out of the single market will be like fitting concrete overshoes to a man who is already close to drowning.&nbsp;</p> <p>Why then is such a horrific double-whammy even conceivable? Four rounds of talks with Brussels have gone badly and Boris Johnson&nbsp;has set an adamant face against asking for an extension to the transition. Negotiations by videolink are not a satisfactory substitute for meeting face to face. As one veteran of bargaining with Brussels says: \u201cYou can\u2019t have those quiet, informal corridor conversations where you say, \u2018If we give a bit on this point, can you give something on that point?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>There might be a chance of overcoming that handicap with goodwill, but the talks have been characterised by&nbsp;mutual distrust, grandstanding and temper tantrums.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"239e08df243778ba3a300f24e8c20550d1e78410\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/239e08df243778ba3a300f24e8c20550d1e78410/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rishi Sunak\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Rishi Sunak was a keen Brexiter, but the Treasury as an institution is appalled by the prospect of a no-deal outcome.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Chown/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Each side accuses the other of being unreasonable. The EU is right that the Johnson government has been backsliding on commitments made in the withdrawal agreement, behaviour that has deepened their pre-existing suspicions of a British prime minister who&nbsp;caused enduring offence by comparing the EU to Nazi prison guards. The British government is right that some of the EU\u2019s demands, especially on fisheries and state aid, are too aggressive.&nbsp;</p> <p>The rawest complaint from London is that the EU is treating Britain as a supplicant rather than an \u201cequal\u201d sovereign state.&nbsp;The EU retorts that the Johnson government is not, as it claims to be, seeking a free trade agreement, but demanding the right to cherry-pick privileged access to the single market.&nbsp;</p> <p>Both sides now sound resigned to the idea that there\u2019s no chance of an agreement before October, perilously close to the cliff edge. Number 10 is making&nbsp;noises that the negotiations need to be taken to a higher level by engaging heads of government. The trouble is that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/04/eu-leaders-will-intervene-in-brexit-talks-in-autumn-says-german-official\">European leaders are bored stiff with Brexit</a> and the coronavirus crisis has pushed it further down their list of priorities.&nbsp;</p> <p>EU leaders are also bound to ask themselves whether a British government heavily populated with some of the most hardline Brexiters wants the negotiations to succeed anyway. They can hear the faction of Tory ultras who argue that no deal the EU will ever offer can be a deal worth having. In the cabinet, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, and Priti Patel, the home secretary, are among ministers who lean in that direction. A crash-out was emphatically not what was promised when Brexit was sold to the public with the reassurance that negotiating a trade agreement with the EU would be a \u201cpiece of cake\u201d.&nbsp;At the December election, Mr Johnson told the British people that he had an \u201coven-ready deal\u201d. What we get now from his kitchen is the smell of something burning.</p> <p>Some people close to the prime minister have been telling their friends in the media that this breach of trust won\u2019t matter because the economic damage will be masked by and can be blamed on that caused by the disease. This is like telling a man who has been deprived of both his arms that he won\u2019t notice losing his legs as well. This theory is unconvincing even to many Tories. As one former cabinet minister remarks: \u201cWe\u2019ll most likely be in a terrible recession at the turn of the year and you\u2019ll have bankrupted businesses popping up saying this was the last straw. They\u2019d say they had managed to survive the coronavirus, only to be killed by a crash-out of the single market.\u201d</p> <p>The view that this would be crazy has some representation around the cabinet table. A few moderate voices survived the purge of the Remainers that Mr Johnson conducted when he became prime minister.&nbsp;Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, is one of the residual sensibles in the cabinet. So probably is Matt Hancock, but the health secretary has other things to worry about at the moment. The most intriguing figure is the chancellor. Rishi Sunak was a keen Brexiter, but the Treasury as an institution is appalled by the prospect of a no-deal outcome and colleagues suspect that Mr Sunak has lost any enthusiasm he might once have had. The chancellor borrowed more than \u00a360bn in April alone to pour funds into business support programmes and job retention schemes. A lot of that money will be squandered if a crash-out then pushes many businesses under anyway.</p> <p>Some observers say that it doesn\u2019t really matter how the cabinet splits because it doesn\u2019t really matter what the cabinet thinks. \u201cMost of them will just nod along to whatever Boris decides to do,\u201d predicts one senior Tory.</p> <p>Some argue that the prime minister genuinely wants a deal, but believes that the way to get to it is to play hardball. It was his consistent critique of Theresa May and David Cameron that they got lousy offers from the EU because they were never prepared to threaten to walk away. It is contended that a tight deadline and a tough stance will force concessions from the EU. \u201cThey\u2019ll be desperate for a deal by the autumn,\u201d claims one senior Brexiter. Did he not, say Mr Johnson\u2019s cheerleaders, confound all the doubters last autumn when the EU agreed to rewrite the deal it had signed with Mrs May? Yes, there was a change to the agreement, but not because Mr Johnson is a genius at brinkmanship. He got a deal by making an almighty concession on the Irish backstop, which, as the government belatedly conceded under the cover of the coronavirus crisis, puts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/13/brexit-will-mean-checks-on-goods-crossing-irish-sea-government-admits\">a regulatory border</a> between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. </p> <p>This prime minister has a flair for putting a boastful face on failures to keep his promises \u2013 witness his \u201cworld-beating\u201d handling of the epidemic \u2013 but it fools only those who don\u2019t bother to check the fine print.</p> <p>It would be madness for Britain and bad for the EU not to reach an agreement. Where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way. There\u2019s a way. The question is whether there\u2019s the will. If there\u2019s not, a crisis triggered by a microbe will be calamitously compounded by a disaster that will be entirely manmade.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",
  "<p>The Trump administration has dismantled key federal tools for imposing accountability on police forces engaging in systemic racial discrimination, severely hampering efforts to heal the wounds of the police killing of George Floyd and the ongoing protests convulsing the country.</p> <p>Under Donald Trump, the US justice department has allowed federal mechanisms designed to impose change on racist police agencies to wither on the vine. As a result, law enforcement agencies that practice racial profiling, use excessive force and other forms of unconstitutional policing are now free from federal oversight.&nbsp;</p> <p>The most important of those tools, known as consent decrees, were deployed extensively by the Barack Obama administration in the wake of previous high-profile police killings of unarmed black men. They included the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/12/ferguson-missouri-shooting-michael-brown-civil-rights-police-brutality\">Michael Brown</a> in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014; 12-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/nov/26/cleveland-video-tamir-rice-shooting-police\">Tamir Rice</a> in Cleveland, Ohio, that same year; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/30/baltimore-police-van-freddie-gray-stop\">and the 2015 death of Freddie Gray</a> in Baltimore, Maryland.</p> <p>Under Obama, 14 consent decrees were enforced upon troubled and discriminatory police agencies. By contrast, none have been issued in the more than three years of the Trump administration.</p> <p>By scrapping the use of consent decrees, Trump has effectively made it much harder for the US to recover from the turmoil roiling the nation. In the absence of federal pressure, any reform impetus will have to come from cities and states acting in isolation or from inside police agencies that are likely to be resistant to change.</p> <p>Jonathan Smith, who led the special litigation section of the justice department between 2010 and 2015 and supervised numerous federal investigations into police departments including Ferguson, said the lack of federal action would drag out the current malaise.</p> <p>\u201cThe protests aren\u2019t going to die down. We have a very long summer ahead of us,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Smith said that the scrapping of consent decrees was part of a general message coming from the Trump administration that police forces engaging in brutal and racist practices were above reproach.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s appalling that today\u2019s justice department is saying that police are now immune from any consequences of their bad conduct \u2013 that is terribly dangerous and corrosive,\u201d Smith said.</p> <p>The decision to scupper consent decrees was taken by Trump\u2019s first US attorney general, Jeff Sessions. As one of his final acts in the post, in November 2018 he released a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1109681/download\">memo</a> that so drastically curtailed the remit of the agreements as to render them moribund.</p> <p>Attempting to justify the change, Sessions made clear he believed policing should be left to local and state law enforcement bodies, no matter how brutally they treated black and other minority citizens supposedly under their protection.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not the responsibility of the federal government to manage non-federal law enforcement agencies,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"496bfb0faeef5eaae7cf87998af83db738e9c4e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/496bfb0faeef5eaae7cf87998af83db738e9c4e6/0_201_2816_1690/1000.jpg\" alt=\"As attorney general, Jeff Sessions made consent decrees in effect moribund by drastically curtailing their remit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As attorney general, Jeff Sessions made consent decrees in effect moribund by drastically curtailing their remit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said it was \u201castonishing the attorney general can simply decide to leave on the shelf a critical tool that would allow us to address this terrible problem\u201d.</p> <p>She added that Sessions\u2019 decision to abdicate from federal government oversight of unconstitutional policing was in tune with his longstanding opposition to tackling systemic racial discrimination within policing.</p> <p>Sessions\u2019 approach has been continued by his successor as US attorney general, Bill Barr. \u201cSessions and Barr embrace the \u2018bad apples\u2019 theory of police brutality \u2013 they simply won\u2019t accept the concept of systemic discrimination in police departments,\u201d Ifill said. \u201cThis is catastrophic. Prosecuting police officers, one by one, will not result in fundamental change.\u201d</p> <p>Consent decrees fall under the 1994 <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/law-enforcement-misconduct-statute-42-usc-14141\">Law Enforcement Misconduct Act</a> that was passed by Congress in the wake of the brutal beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles police three years earlier. The statute allows the US government to sue local police agencies that engage in \u201cpatterns and practices\u201d of unconstitutional policing and fail to comply with essential reforms.</p> <p>The provision has made a profound impact on several of the most troubled police forces in the country, including Baltimore following the death of Freddie Gray. The 25-year-old black man died in April 2015 after he sustained spinal injuries while being transported under arrest in a police van.</p> <p>Since it was introduced, Baltimore\u2019s consent decree has been credited with bringing critical change to policing in that city.</p>",

It also highlighted increased US reliance, at home and abroad, on the aggressive use of force as a first resort.<br></p> <p>The militarisation of US police forces, and American society as a whole, is rooted in the response to the 9/11 attacks, when George W Bush plunged the country into a state of perpetual war. Paradoxically, his \u201cglobal war on terror\u201d intensified international and domestic insecurity.</p> <p>It sparked a huge, parallel expansion in the powers and reach of the homeland security apparatus.

About 18,000 law enforcement agencies employ 800,000 officers nationwide. Many are armed to the teeth.<br></p> <p>Deserving or not, members of the US armed forces are routinely described as heroes by Trump and others. Amid high levels of gun violence, many on the frontline of domestic law enforcement plainly feel they are worthy of similar status and protection.</p> <p>Yet when police officers are uniformed, equipped and armed like soldiers, it is unsurprising that they act with soldier-like impunity, treating civilians as the enemy in what Mark Esper, the defence secretary, calls the <a href=\"https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2020/06/01/secdef-encourages-governors-to-dominate-the-battlespace-to-put-down-nationwide-protests/\">urban \u201cbattlespace\u201d</a>.

He sought personal legitimacy by hiring savvy generals such as HR McMaster and James Mattis, then rejected their advice.

  "<p>One of the more pertinent statements made during this past extraordinary week appeared in one of the last places I would have thought to look \u2013 in the pages of <em>Vogue</em>, not a publication I instinctively turn to at a moment of profound political tension.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cRacism is a global issue. Racism is a British issue. It is not one that is merely confined to the United States \u2013 it is everywhere, and it is systemic,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/news/article/edward-enninful-racism\">wrote</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/edward-enninful\">Edward Enninful</a>, the editor-in-chief of the magazine\u2019s British edition. The ubiquity of racism has been brought to stark and sudden attention by the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> and by the unprecedented wave of protests, demonstrations and rioting that followed.</p> <p>Filmed by many witnesses and now viewed millions of times, the killing of Floyd by a Minnesota policeman, a 21st-century lynching, is so sickening a crime that the revulsion it has induced has become a global phenomenon.</p> <p>The demonstrators and activists who have taken to the streets have, however, been motivated by more than revulsion. They have also been stirred to action by acknowledging a fundamental truth \u2013 that the killing of Floyd has to be understood as a symptom of systemic racism. By building their campaign around that reality they have promoted radical and challenging conversations \u2013 in countries on both sides of the Atlantic \u2013 about the nature of racism and the actions that people of all races can take in eliminating it. These are conversations that we have needed for a very long time.</p> <p>Led by young people, many of them inspired by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a>, and involving people of all ethnicities, the protests have morphed into a worldwide anti-racist movement. No longer is this moment solely about police violence nor is it limited to America. Both online and on the streets it is calling out racism, wherever it exists and in whatever forms it is found. In both the US and in Europe, people are asking, tentatively, if this might be a defining moment of change.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a9daf1e6546231cf57669c8a5976a9c05849b35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a9daf1e6546231cf57669c8a5976a9c05849b35/0_120_5399_3241/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The British actor John Boyega speaks at a Black Lives Matter protest in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The British actor John Boyega speaks to the crowd during a Black Lives Matter protest in Hyde Park on 3 June 2020 in London, England.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet in the immediate aftermath of Floyd\u2019s death there was little reason to imagine anything would be any different this time around.

On Tuesday, the <a href=\"https://blackculturalarchives.org/blog/2020/6/1/a-statement-from-bca-our-lives-matter-its-time-for-change\">Black Cultural Archives</a> in Brixton, south London \u2013 the closest thing we have in this country to a museum to the black British experience \u2013 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bcaheritage\">tweeted</a> the names and the photographs of some of them \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/mark-duggan\">Mark Duggan</a>, Sheku Bayoh, Sean Rigg, Sarah Reed, Cherry Groce, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-51587151\">Leon Briggs</a>, Christopher Alder, Brian Douglas.</p> <p>Yet almost instantly a predictable chorus of voices, emanating from predictable corners of British public life, rose up to dismiss the whole thing as an irrelevance. Using a familiar playbook, they accused those black Britons who see reflections of their own situation in the experiences of African Americans of making false comparisons.</p> <p>The US situation is unique in both its depth and ferocity, they say, so that no parallels can be drawn with the situation in Britain. The smoke-and-mirrors aspect of this argument is that it attempts to focus attention solely on police violence, rather than the racism that inspired it. Those who make it usually point to the ubiquity of firearms in US law enforcement, as proof that the US reality is beyond meaningful comparison. But firearms had nothing to do with the killing of George Floyd. Neither were they a factor in the death of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-32400497\">Freddie Gray</a> or the sidewalk killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/eric-garner\">Eric Garner</a>, who, like Floyd, pleaded for his life, saying 11 times to the officers who pinned him down: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d, the same words Floyd used in his final moments.

Black men are stopped and searched at nine times the rate of white men. Black people make up 3% of the population of England and Wales but account for 12% of the prison population and not since 1971 have British police officers been prosecuted for the killing of a black man, and even then they were charged with the lesser crime of manslaughter and that charge was later dropped.</p> <p>To say that the racism that infects parts of our police force and criminal justice system is less virulent than that which poisons the lives of 40 million African Americans is not much of a boast. Is that really the extent of our ambition \u2013 to be a somewhat less racist nation than one led by a man who describes white nationalists and members of the Ku Klux Klan as \u201cvery fine people\u201d? Surely we who dwell in what the actor Laurence Fox recently assured us is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/18/question-time-clash-lecturer-tells-of-hate-mail\">the most tolerant, lovely country in Europe</a>\u201d have higher hopes?</p> <p>Excusing or downplaying British racism with comparisons to the US is a bad habit with a long history. It began in 1807, with the abolition of the slave trade and picked up steam three decades later with the end of British slavery, twin events that marked the beginning of 200 years of moral posturing and historical amnesia. The Victorian readers who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/feb/22/review-harriet-beecher-stowe-uncle-toms-cabin\">rightly wept</a> over <em>Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin</em>, for example, conveniently forgot which nation had carried his ancestors into slavery and didn\u2019t dwell on the fact that most of the cotton produced by American slaves like him was shipped to Liverpool.</p> <p>For two centuries, we have deployed American racism as a distraction. It\u2019s as if we find it easier to recognise American forms of racism than we do our own&nbsp;home-grown varieties. Convenient, as pointing fingers is always more comforting than looking in the mirror.</p> <p>\u2022 David Olusoga is a historian and broadcaster</p>",
  "<h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>I get in to parliament early for a remote TV interview with Sky TV\u2019s Kay Burley. She cuts me off saying \u201cChris Bryant loves to have the last word but I\u2019m not going to let him!\u201d Afterwards Twitter points out the record of Eartha Kitt singing I\u2019m Still Here behind my left shoulder. I then battle with uncooperative IT before remotely chairing the standards committee.</p> <p>Then to the chamber. There are signs everywhere saying \u201ckeep left\u201d (insert your own joke here) and \u201ckeep moving\u201d. So the corridors of power are transitory. No huddles allowed. One of the whips quips: \u201cHow can you plot when you have to keep two metres apart?\u201d</p> <p>The big issue of the day is whether MPs should be allowed to participate remotely from in front of their bookcases. Those with shielding responsibilities understandably don\u2019t want to be excluded, but the leader of the house, Jacob Rees-Mogg, winds us all up by saying we have to \u201creturn to work\u201d, as we all feel as if we\u2019ve been working 24/7 for weeks.</p> <p>We have two votes \u2013 on how to vote \u2013 which involve MPs traipsing round the bend for more than kilometre. Kevin Brennan calls it the \u201cMogg Conga\u201d but none of us will qualify for Strictly. We lose the votes, but afterwards two members of the cabinet scold me: \u201cWe hoped you\u2019d win.\u201d&nbsp;Another tells me: \u201cKeep on calling votes all the time, and they\u2019ll give in pretty quickly.\u201d Back home, I catch the appalling news from America.</p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>Everyone looks about a decade older than when I last saw them. Or maybe it\u2019s just their hair. Edward Timpson is sporting a bouffant in search of a medallion. Robert Courts boasts that his wife has cut his hair rather beautifully. Ed Miliband says his wife has had three goes at his, but he still looks very Desert Island. My No 4 clipper-cut doesn\u2019t seem to impress anybody.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rees-Mogg tells us no MP should be too grand to queue, which makes me wonder when he last queued at Lidl</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Since only 50 of us are allowed in the chamber at any one time, I sit in my office for a series of video meetings via Zoom, Teams and Skype. One is about the local after-effects of Storm Dennis. Lots of homes were flooded and parts of a coal tip slipped into the river. The council now have to find a new home for 60,000 tonnes of slag. I also catch up with local police, who tell me the Cummings saga has made enforcement of the lockdown 10 times more difficult.</p> <p>The rest of the day is taken up with trying to overturn the previous day\u2019s votes. Ten minutes after I leave the Commons I hear the government has caved in. Some MPs can now participate remotely after all.</p> <h2>Thursday&nbsp;</h2> <p>I spend most of the morning in the chamber, asking questions about support for theatres and how coronavirus has hit the poor. Rees-Mogg tells us no MP should be too grand to queue, which makes me wonder when he last queued at Lidl. </p> <p>The Commons tearoom is open because it\u2019s classed as a staff canteen. It\u2019s a real luxury to eat food that I haven\u2019t cooked myself.</p> <p>I drive back to the Rhondda.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Friday</h2> <p>I am inundated with emails and Facebook messages. Should people be camping on the top of the Rhigos mountain? Why is there a 5-mile limit in Wales? Should people cancel their summer holiday?</p> <p>One good thing. The Welsh government is giving a \u00a3500 bonus to care workers. Initially that left out ancillary staff, but now cooks and cleaners are getting it as well, so we just have to persuade Rishi Sunak not to tax it.</p> <p>I chat to a lady who is desperate to visit her husband, who is in a local care home. My heart goes out to her.&nbsp;The weekly catch-up with the council leader focuses on reopening schools and the campaign to keep the local A&amp;E. In the 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Trealaw Scouts Zoom meeting I am asked about chlorinated chicken and whether Boris Johnson needs a haircut.</p> <p>My mother-in-law Jo hasn\u2019t seen a soul since lockdown began, so she was really looking forward to popping round to sit in the garden with us.&nbsp;It rained, so we huddled under separate trees.</p>",
  "<p>I\u2019m a formless blob,\u201d laments a friend. \u201cThe only thing I want to do is eat and sleep,\u201d says another. I feel the same. My non-work time is spent\u2026 actually I don\u2019t know. I stare listlessly at the wall for a bit on Friday and suddenly it\u2019s Tuesday. Despite this, I find myself forensically checking friends\u2019, acquaintances\u2019 and nemeses\u2019 pictures and analysing offhand comments for any sign they may, in fact, be working on a novel or starting a new business on the sly.</p> <p>Because I have developed a new paranoia: that people who say they haven\u2019t achieved anything in lockdown are lying. I fear they are the adult equivalent of those kids who, having loudly proclaimed they hadn\u2019t revised at all for the test, quietly ace it. I will be lulled into believing everyone is watching <em>Grand Designs</em> all day coated in Dorito dust, but they will emerge with a six-pack, a moving trilogy that redefines contemporary literature or the next Airblade (intellectual property lawyers are reporting a steep increase in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/eureka-moment-law-firms-report-rush-to-patent-ideas-in-midst-of-uk-lockdown\" title=\"\">patent applications</a>).</p> <p>I know it\u2019s irrational, but the sense we should be achieving creates an insidious thrum of unease on top of our real worries. Internet gentlemen explaining that if we haven\u2019t acquired 100,000 YouTube subscribers, learned Mandarin or deadlifted 200kg, we \u201cdidn\u2019t lack time, we lacked discipline\u201d, don\u2019t help either. Surely one of the few advantages of 2020 is that it\u2019s OK to lack discipline. This is an age of self-acceptance: as prominent contemporary philosopher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/03/rupaul-drag-race-big-f-you-to-male-dominated-culture\" title=\"\">RuPaul Charles</a> puts it: \u201cIf you can\u2019t love yourself, how the hell you gonna love somebody else (can I get an amen)\u201d. It\u2019s good we no longer cleave to buttoned-up self-denial, suffering nobly or wastefully like the characters in <em>Brief Encounter </em>or that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/ianmcewan\" title=\"\">Ian McEwan</a> novel about premature ejaculation. Right now, there is much to be said for accepting that we want a little nap, four post-dinner crumpets, or to spend the day weeping in a tepid bath and giving in.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The only asana I have mastered post-corona is what I\u2019m calling 'modified corpse pose'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The problem is that self-flagellation is all I know \u2013 it\u2019s got me this far. So I\u2019ve decided to shake my torpor and try a little self-improvement. The only thing I have mastered recently is clear insight into my character flaws, so I\u2019m trying to address them with some post-lockdown resolutions\u2026</p> <p>Direct my limited energies better: I have spent approximately 496 hours this month trying to buy discontinued oversized mugs (ah yes, that\u2019s where all my time went). I already have three, but recent scarcity madness infected me and I am irrationally fixated on giant tea receptacles. As I write, my husband has come in holding two newly acquired specimens and asked how many mugs I have bought (I don\u2019t like his tone). The answer is: \u201cNot enough!\u201d I don\u2019t know what use this mug reserve will be in the end times: maybe they\u2019ll be the new shell money when global capitalism collapses. It\u2019s a long shot. Remedy: I\u2019ve relinquished my eBay password to my husband who will presumably use it for his own stockpile (lightbulbs). Mug cold turkey is easy. But not replacing it with something unhelpful (being so furious at the government my head feels as if it will split open like a watermelon, perhaps) may prove harder.</p> <p>Stop getting high on my own sanctimony: disapproving of park barbecues or crowded beaches is not my thing, but not because I am a compassionate person who accepts others may be fighting battles of which I know nothing. No, it is because I exhaust my judgmental impulses at home. I have become the wastefinder general. Exuding the sourly parsimonious energy of the landlady of a seedy postwar boarding house, I try to catch people eating fresh food then brandish a single clingfilmed Linda McCartney sausage or sliver of cheese hardened to fingernail consistency and exhort them to \u201cbe mindful of food waste\u201d and \u201cthink of the planet\u201d. Remedy: I must confess to my family I lied about the availability of avocados and ate one alone in secret, thereby losing all credibility as the food tsar.</p> <p>Lighten up: recent evidence has confirmed I am a controlling fun sponge. I instigated pizza night as an attempt at family entertainment, but within minutes my insistence on everyone doing it exactly my way turned it into the kind of joyless high-stakes cookery show where someone cries over a poorly deboned quail. We ate our \u2013 perfectly executed \u2013 pizzas in funereal silence. Remedy: I\u2019ve banned myself from supervising group activities (and possibly also taking part in them).</p> <p>Finally, my grotesque laziness:<strong> </strong>I used to do yoga. Now I click on links to classes then ignore them. The only asana I have mastered post-corona is what I\u2019m calling \u201cmodified corpse pose\u201d. You lie flat on your back holding your phone an inch from your face with one hand and a Twix in the other (it\u2019s very restorative). At least I haven\u2019t used \u201cI fell down a wombat hole\u201d as an excuse, as happened during a friend\u2019s yoga session, but the rot must stop. Remedy: finish writing this, avoid marsupial burrows and finally press play, I suppose. </p> <p><em>Follow Emma on Twitter&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BelgianWaffling?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@BelgianWaffling</a></em></p>",
  "<p>A couple of years ago, Samira Ahmed was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/100-voices/people-nation-empire/background-to-the-project\">interviewed for the BBC\u2019s archives</a> about the roots of her \u201cincredible affection\u201d for the corporation. The interview, to introduce the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/100-voices/people-nation-empire\">People</a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/100-voices/people-nation-empire\">, Nation</a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/100-voices/people-nation-empire\">, Empire</a>\u201d strand of the online history, sits alongside footage of the arrival of the Windrush boat at Tilbury docks and clips from <em>The Black and White Minstrel Show</em>. In it, Ahmed describes a trip she made to the Pebble Mill studios in Birmingham, aged nine, to watch her mother, Lalita Ahmed, present a Hindustani chatshow in which British-Asian women discussed everything from yoga to domestic violence. Ahmed, a long way from her home in south-west London, sat wide-eyed up in the gallery. \u201cEveryone there, except for [my mother] and her guests was white,\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd everyone was so incredibly polite and professional. I remember the director; I think he was called Jeremy.\u201d Looking back on that visit, she believed \u201cit was quite a life-changing moment for me. It made me realise that people like me were welcome. And people like me could have a career at the BBC, which was for everybody.\u201d</p> <p>A little over a decade later, Ahmed won one of the few coveted golden tickets as a graduate trainee in the BBC newsroom. She became a reporter on the <em>Today</em> programme (alongside a youthful Michael Gove) and then on <em>Newsnight</em>, before going on to present <em>Night Waves</em>, <em>The World Tonight</em> and, currently, <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qsq5\">Front Row</a></em>. It has only perhaps been in the past year, however, that she has written a brand-new chapter in BBC history of her own.&nbsp;</p> <p>That chapter will tell future generations of the story of her successful fight to bring to light the gross inequalities in pay at the corporation between men and women. Last October, Ahmed took her employer to a tribunal to challenge that long-standing injustice. To read the judgment in that case is to reflect on the ingrained absurdity of our ideas about \u201cstar quality\u201d, and how media \u201cpersonalities\u201d are created. Pointedly, the case rested on two programmes in which the BBC\u2019s values were held up to public scrutiny: <em>Points of View</em>, presented by Jeremy Vine, and <em>Newswatch</em>, presented by Ahmed. Vine \u2013 who then drew a \u00a3700,000 salary from the corporation \u2013&nbsp;received \u00a33,000 per episode for his show. Ahmed was paid \u00a3440 for, as she said, \u201cdoing very similar work\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>BBC lawyers defended Vine's salary of \u00a33,000 per episode of Points of View on the grounds he had 'a glint in the eye'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A main plank of the BBC lawyers\u2019 expensive case against her was that the enormous discrepancy was explained by Vine having \u201ca glint in the eye\u201d and being \u201ccheeky\u201d. The judge in the case was not convinced. \u201cJeremy Vine read the script from the autocue,\u201d the judgment noted. \u201cIf it told him to roll his eyes he did. It did not require any particular skill or experience to do that.\u201d</p> <p>Ahmed won an undisclosed six-figure settlement from the BBC \u2013 she had claimed \u00a3700,000 in \u201clost\u201d earnings over many years \u2013&nbsp;as well as costs. After the tribunal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/10/samira-ahmed-wins-equal-pay-claim-against-bbc\">she briefly put her victory in context</a>. \u201cI\u2019d like to thank my union, the NUJ\u2026 and I\u2019d especially like to thank the Ford Dagenham women and the women of the Grunwick factory strike who fought for equal pay going back to the 1960s and 70s. I\u2019m now really looking forward to continuing to do my job, to report on stories and not being one.\u201d</p> <p>Ahmed has, subsequently, been as good as her word. When she won an award in March for audio broadcaster of the year, partly for her podcast <em><a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/howifoundmyvoice#:~:text=How%20I%20Found%20My%20Voice%20is%20the%20podcast%20that%20explores,compelling%20%E2%80%93%20and%20unique%20%E2%80%93%20communicators.\">How I Found My Voice</a></em>, she <a href=\"http://www.samiraahmed.co.uk/broadcasting-press-guild-award-speech-2020/\">noted</a> only that \u201call I\u2019ve ever asked is to be judged on my own abilities and to be given equal opportunities\u201d. She agreed to this interview on the basis that it would highlight her absorbing new three-part series, <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08fk8pn\">Art of Persia</a></em>, in which she was granted unprecedented access to the Islamic Republic of Iran to report on some of its historic treasures, but she has been a journalist long enough to know that the series is only part of her story.&nbsp;</p> <p>We talked by Zoom last week. Her family lockdown has involved Ahmed and her husband sharing their Wimbledon home with their two children, 18 and 20, and an American university friend who was stranded. Her visits to Broadcasting House have been restricted to a weekly recording for <em>Front Row</em>; frustratingly, given the heightened attention to the politics of news-gathering through the pandemic, <em>Newswatch</em> has been a victim of reduced staffing.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a989fd9bfef46c828a583923294c338f52bab6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a989fd9bfef46c828a583923294c338f52bab6e/24_206_4406_2644/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arriving at her employment tribunal (second from left) in London in November last year with supporters including fellow presenter Naga Munchetty (to her left).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ahmed (second from left) arriving at her employment tribunal in London in November last year with supporters (from left) science presenter Claudia Hammond, fellow BBC presenter Naga Munchetty and lawyer and activist Dr Shola Mos-Shogbamimu.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We talked first about <em>Art of Persia</em> \u2013 three years (or a thousand) in the making. Like me, Ahmed has only just seen the final edit of the series and is thrilled by it.&nbsp;</p> <p>She first visited Iran for Channel 4 in 2002, for a programme on feminism in Islam, and had always wanted to return. The chance came in 2015 when the BBC first asked her to front this series; it eventually took two years to negotiate visas before she and the crew were allowed in last year, on two extensive journeys.&nbsp;They were granted some remarkable access to cultural objects and sites that had been off-limits to western cameras since the 1979 revolution. Some, like the original manuscript of the <em>Shahnameh</em> \u2013 the priceless 10th-century Book of Kings that provides the narrative for part of Ahmed\u2019s journey \u2013 have never been viewed in this way before.</p> <p>Though tensions were high in Iran during the second of Ahmed\u2019s visits, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/21/iran-latest-trump-drone-attack-timeline-airstrikes-called-off\">an American surveillance drone was shot down last June</a> over the Strait of Hormuz, a BBC camera drone was nevertheless allowed to film over extraordinary desert cities like Yazd, where Ahmed met the original Zoroastrians and toured a bazaar largely unchanged since Marco Polo visited. Only once or twice did they brush up against the secret police of the Revolutionary Guards; mostly they were at liberty to capture that resilient poetic underground spirit of Persian culture, which has always been at odds with fundamentalist Shi\u2019ism.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cPeople would come up and talk to me at sites, and say, \u2018We would like to apologise to you for our government,\u2019\u201d she says of the great warmth of welcome they received from ordinary Iranians wherever they went. \u201cI\u2019m very wary of making comparisons,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I did find myself thinking a few times of East Germany before the wall came down.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Watching the ease and curiosity with which Ahmed uncovers this history, always letting the present of Iran filter into her storytelling, you have the sense this is the kind of programme, mixing culture and politics and history, that she has wanted to make ever since her eyes were first opened to the BBC all those years ago.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In my first term at Oxford people would point out Boris Johnson and suggest that he would one day be prime minister</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ahmed was the daughter of parents who shared one of those wonderful London love stories of the 1960s. Her mother had recently arrived in the capital from Lucknow in north India, a Hindu on a bursary from the World Service. Her father was a Pakistani Muslim from Karachi. In the absence of family, they took the bus to the register office for their wedding and celebrated with a meal at an Indian restaurant in Bayswater, which they paid for in luncheon vouchers.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ahmed, a frequent contributor to <em><a href=\"https://newhumanist.org.uk/contributors/5253/samira-ahmed\">New Humanist</a></em><a href=\"https://newhumanist.org.uk/contributors/5253/samira-ahmed\"> magazine</a>, was raised to respect all religions and none. She had an Arabic tutor and learned to read the Qur\u2019an. Her mother used to take her and her sister and brother to the Hindu temple. She went to a Catholic school and, not wanting to be left out, when everyone was doing first holy communion classes she did them too. (\u201cI knew it might be the only chance I got to wear a white wedding dress.\u201d) It was a childhood in which nothing felt off limits.&nbsp;</p> <p>Her dad ran his own business selling catering supplies to Indian and Chinese restaurants; her mother, as well as her work for the BBC that included a cookery slot on <em>Pebble Mill at One</em>, was an actor, with credits including Meera Syal\u2019s <em>Bhaji on the Beach</em>. Ahmed is reluctant to suggest that she fulfilled her mother\u2019s ambitions to perform, though she recalls a conversation in which her mum, now 80, sitting in the garden, once whispered to her: \u201cYou know, it\u2019s not too late, we could go to Bollywood and give it a go!\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Ahmed\u2019s dreams were much more earnest. In 2015 she cheerfully subjected herself to the cringes of Rufus Hound\u2019s radio series <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07hfwrm\">My Teenage Diary</a></em>, reading from her adolescent journals. Though they contained stray fantasies of meeting David Bowie, and speculation about who shot JR, mostly, aged 15 and 16, she kept up a daily running commentary on the Libyan embassy siege and the miners\u2019 strike. She recalled making her parents switch from the <em>Times</em> to the <em>Guardian</em> after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/27/rupert-murdoch-wapping-25-years\">the battle of Wapping</a>, and kept all the back issues as a reference library. It was around this time, she suggested laughing, that she decided there were only two kinds of people: \u201ccollaborators and the resistance\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>She had identified strongly with Laura Ingalls Wilder\u2019s pioneer heroine in <em>Little House on the Prairie</em>, and was \u201ca fiery girl with long plaits\u201d. Her mother insisted she stand up for herself. \u201cThe 70s was quite horrible for racism in this country,\u201d she says. \u201cWalking down the street in south London, if some kids shouted some racial abuse at us, my mother always stopped and turned around and gave them this filthy look. She would look at me and say: \u2018Don\u2019t ever be afraid of these people.\u2019\u201d Ahmed held on to those principles.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a7ab84ce995ba8962ee9a7e5e4dde2085041a5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a7ab84ce995ba8962ee9a7e5e4dde2085041a5b/0_0_4284_2856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"At Jameh Mosque, Yazd, Iran, in her new BBC Four series The Art of Persia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At Jameh Mosque, Yazd, Iran, in her new BBC Four series The Art of Persia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Craig Hastings/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the end of her <em>Teenage Diary</em> embarrassments, Hound asked her what her teenage self would have said to her now. She replied without hesitation: \u201cWell, you haven\u2019t sold out, I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p> <p>In her podcast interview series, <em>How I Found My Voice</em> \u2013 she has interviewed heroes from Gina Miller to Michael Palin \u2013 Ahmed proves herself endlessly curious about the choices people have made in becoming successful. After acing her exams at her independent girls\u2019 school she had a front-row seat in how privilege and patronage worked at Oxford. She was a contemporary of Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove. \u201cIn my first term people would point out Boris Johnson,\u201d she said, \u201cand suggest that he would one day be prime minister. That idea seemed utterly ridiculous.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>She recalls editing the Oxford Union magazine when Gove was president. He wrote a bracing editorial, which she has kept, about&nbsp;elitism. \u201cI cannot overemphasise what elitism is NOT,\u201d he argued. \u201cIt is not about back-slapping cliques, reactionary chic or Old Etonian egos. It is a spirit of unashamed glamour, excitement and competition.\u201d</p> <p>She chooses her words with consummate BBC care when I ask her if she is surprised how Gove \u2013 \u201calways very charming and extremely clever\u201d \u2013 has turned out. \u201cI was very interested to see him describe Dominic Cummings as a man of honesty and integrity,\u201d she says. \u201cI am very much a Generation X-er. I always thought when our turn came to be running things, we would do things right.\u201d&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There was an episode of The Goodies that I literally thought about every morning that I walked into the tribunal</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ahmed has interviewed enough campaigners and whistleblowers over the years to know that motivation to stand up and be counted comes from sometimes unexpected places. When she was being interviewed on stage about her teenage diaries she mentioned how once she was called in to be reprimanded by her headmistress for something she had not done and surprised herself by answering back \u201cI think you should challenge the official version more.\u201d \u201cI was just thinking out loud really,\u201d she says now, \u201cbut [when I recalled that] the studio audience gave a loud whoop. That was a year before the BBC salary figures were first published, but it stayed with me. Everything I\u2019ve done has been because it felt like the right thing to do. And I think when you do that, you find most people are on your side.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>The reluctant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jul/19/evans-lineker-bbc-top-earners-only-two-women-among-best-paid-stars\">publication</a> of those salary figures of the BBC\u2019s \u201ctalent\u201d for the first time in 2017 had a big impact, she says. What senior women at the BBC had suspected just about for ever was now shown to be fact. \u201cI tried to treat my own story as if it was any other story,\u201d she says of her tribunal case, \u201cand approach it as an investigative journalist. I gathered as much evidence as I could, and went through it stage by stage.\u201d</p> <p>To begin with there was a letter to the papers signed by 33 women involved, asking for things to be put right. That group stayed together, sharing information, speaking regularly, involving the union. At least 20 cases around equal pay are pending, not only from headline act presenters but also from editors and producers.&nbsp;</p> <p>Just how much of a risk those women have taken to get to that stage was outlined in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/08/carrie-gracie-letter-in-full\">open letter by Carrie Gracie</a>, the former BBC China editor, who initially resigned in disgust when it was revealed that she was being paid only a little more than half of male counterparts such as Jon Sopel in Washington. Gracie \u2013 who later accepted parity and backpay from the BBC after a brutal year of argument \u2013 described how women in her privileged but unequal position \u201chave felt trapped. Speaking out carries the risk of disciplinary measures or even dismissal; litigation can destroy careers and be financially ruinous. What\u2019s more the BBC often settles cases out of court and demands non-disclosure agreements, a habit unworthy of an organisation committed to truth, and one which does nothing to resolve the systemic problem.\u201d</p> <p>Someone, it was clear, had to break that pattern of divide and rule. Ahmed\u2019s earnings comparison with Jeremy Vine was so stark that it must have looked like the perfect test case\u2026&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think of it that way,\u201d Ahmed insists. \u201cAnd I should stress Jeremy Vine was very decent to me personally. [Vine subsequently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/01/jeremy-vine-at-the-bbc-you-can-have-values-but-you-cant-have-views-thats-how-i-operate\">accepted a 50%</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/01/jeremy-vine-at-the-bbc-you-can-have-values-but-you-cant-have-views-thats-how-i-operate\"> reduction in his pay packet</a> \u2013 currently \u00a3300,000 \u2013 saying \u201che wasn\u2019t comfortable with what the pay reveal showed\u201d].&nbsp;\u201cJeremy gave me all the information I asked for, as did every man at the BBC that I asked,\u201d Ahmed says.&nbsp;</p> <p>One of her strategies to cope with the scrutiny of the tribunal itself was to remember a childhood TV favourite of hers. \u201cThere was an episode of <em>The Goodies</em> that I literally thought about every morning that I walked into the tribunal,\u201d she says, with a laugh. \u201cIt is the one called <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p008r17h\">Cunning Stunts</a>. The Goodies set up a newspaper office and they hire Tessa Wyatt to be a reporter, but [subverting their sexism] she takes over and starts sexually harassing them and bullying them back. My sister and I used one of her lines for years after: \u201cIf you don\u2019t want it pinched, don\u2019t flaunt it so!\u201d Ahmed met Goodie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/mar/31/weekend7.weekend\">Graeme Garden</a> recently, who was pleased to hear that the episode had been an inspiration: \u201cYou see, satire works \u2013 even if it takes 40 years!\u201d</p> <p>Now she has come out of the other side of the case, and the long months of preparation for it, it\u2019s almost as if, she says, it happened to someone else. \u201cI can\u2019t pretend that I am not pleased. I used to walk from Waterloo station across the bridge to the tribunal every day, and both during it and after it, people were incredibly supportive, they would come up and say: \u2018Good on you!\u2019\u201d After it was over, all sorts of different people got in touch to say how much it meant \u2013 from Katie Puckrik to Richard Coles. \u201cThe Proclaimers sent me a nice message. And so did Margaret Atwood.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6Pu1qx_ue0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V6Pu1qx_ue0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6Pu1qx_ue0\">Watch a trailer for The Art of Persia.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In the course of those months, and despite the BBC lawyers\u2019 efforts to underplay her professional abilities, Ahmed managed to keep any personal anger out of her case. Sometimes, no doubt, that was difficult. When, for example, she heard that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/12/john-humphrys-jokes-about-bbc-gender-pay-gap-in-leaked-off-air-recording\">inadvertently recorded off-air \u201c</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/12/john-humphrys-jokes-about-bbc-gender-pay-gap-in-leaked-off-air-recording\">banter\u201d between John Humphrys and Jon Sopel</a> about Carrie Gracie\u2019s letter (\u201cOh dear God,\u201d Humphrys said to Sopel, \u201cshe\u2019s actually suggested you should lose money\u2026\u201d) did that sharpen her resolve? She smiles judiciously. \u201cI think what is interesting these days, with social media, is that you can see straight away what everyone else makes of something like that. It didn\u2019t really need me to comment. I would just direct you to read everyone else\u2019s comments.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>In his <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08f28nn\">interview last month</a> with the outgoing director general of the BBC, Tony Hall, Andrew Marr referenced Ahmed\u2019s case (forgetting her name, before correcting himself) and wondering whether the BBC was now on top of the issue. Hall made all the right noises about transparency.&nbsp;Does Ahmed feel that the culture that produced her case has been addressed as she would like it to have?</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t say how far that has been sorted yet. But they understand there is an issue; it is ongoing.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>She did, she says, seriously consider at one point applying to be Hall\u2019s successor, but for the time being came to the conclusion that her heart still is in broadcasting \u2013 \u201cthough maybe next time\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>She insists that there have been no repercussions professionally from her case against her employer, though it seems slightly odd to me that her Persia series will go out on BBC Four, and not on BBC One or BBC Two, where it would surely have been if, say, Marr or Vine had been granted the access she had been given. Was she disappointed at that?</p> <p>\u201cI did ask,\u201d she says, diplomatically. \u201cAnd they are trailing the series, so that is a proper bit of investment in it.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Because of her long stint on <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00qjrk2\">Newswatch</a></em>, few people understand the labyrinthine internal politics of the BBC quite as clearly as Ahmed. She remains proud that \u201cnowhere else has a programme like <em>Newswatch,</em> which encourages scrutiny and self-criticism \u2013 even if people don\u2019t always agree with the answers\u201d. Because the programme is currently off air she has been unable to investigate the story behind the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/02/emily-maitlis-back-on-newsnight-in-wake-of-cummings-row\">public censure of Emily Maitlis</a> for breaking impartiality rules in her intro about Dominic Cummings for <em>Newsnight</em> \u2013 though she will have been as surprised as anyone at the speed of the response from the BBC hierarchy.&nbsp;</p> <p>After a third request, she was informed at the beginning of last week that there might be a way for <em>Newswatch</em> to return soon, though the decision has to go to the BBC news board, \u201cwhich might take weeks\u201d. In its absence, Ahmed has plenty to be getting on with. The new series of her podcasts began last week with a live interview with Yotam Ottolenghi; she is preparing slots with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/paloma-faith\">Paloma Faith</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/18/margaret-atwoods-lockdown-diary-life-as-an-eccentric-self-isolationist\">Margaret Atwood</a>, who has become something of a champion of her equal pay battles.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ahmed is 51. Historically, I suggest, the BBC has not had a great track record in developing the careers of its female presenters as they move into their 50s and 60s. Is she confident she can become a role model in that respect also?&nbsp;She laughs. \u201cI hope so. I have definitely had some conversations lately that have channelled my inner Maggie Smith as Miss Jean Brodie and insisted I am in my prime.\u201d Thinking of her Indian-Pakistani family, as much as her BBC one, Ahmed has long had the sense that one of the archetypes that the broadcaster could do with urgently reinventing is that of the \u201cwise auntie\u201d, spirited and trustworthy in equal measure. It is, perhaps, the role her nine-year-old self, sitting in the gods at Pebble Mill, always instinctively understood.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Art of Persia starts on BBC Four on Monday 15 June.

The journey from Uganda to York, via Cambridge, London and Birmingham, has been marked by an extraordinary contribution to the life and faith of both church and nation.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the midst of national debates on racism, inequality and brutality, few in the establishment can claim to have the experience of standing up to injustice and paying the price in the way Sentamu has done. As a high court judge in Uganda and opponent of the regime of Idi Amin, Sentamu refused to overlook the crimes of one of Amin\u2019s family. Defying an order to deliver a not guilty verdict, he was arrested,&nbsp;and badly beaten in a prison cell, subsequently describing the experience as \u201cbeing kicked around like human football\u201d. He suffered severe internal injuries and received the last rites from Keith Sutton, an English priest and later Bishop of Lichfield, who arranged to smuggle Sentamu and his wife, Margaret, out of Uganda upon his release from prison in 1973.&nbsp;</p> <p>As an archbishop, Sentamu\u2019s priorities have included the renewal of discipleship in the church, advocacy for the poor and the need for a living wage, investment in young people and equipping the church to rediscover its confidence in talking about Jesus. Combined with this have been public acts which have sought to draw attention to injustice and highlight its remedies.&nbsp;</p> <p>In church terms, Sentamu has been a moderniser whose relationship with the institution he has served so faithfully has not always been easy. In Birmingham, he reviewed staffing, clergy numbers and finances across the diocese, as well as streamlining both the diocesan administration and reducing the plethora of committees and councils that served the church. Whileother bishops were praised for similar acts, Sentamu was criticised by some \u201cfor behaving like an African chief\u201d, revealing the racism with which he has had to contend.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There was a lady who didn\u2019t want me to take her husband\u2019s funeral because I was black. We received letters with excrement in</p> <footer> <cite>John Sentamu, Archbishop of York</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sentamu\u2019s appointment to York&nbsp;- described by one broadsheet at the time as \u201cpolitical correctness gone gloriously sane\u201d - gave a neat nod to the fact that, for the first time in its history, the Church of England would have a black archbishop. Sentamu played the race element down, responding to one journalist that \u201cfirst I am a Christian, second I am a man, third I am black\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet as an adviser to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/macpherson-report-what-was-it-and-what-impact-did-it-have\">Macpherson Inquiry</a> into the death of Stephen Lawrence and as chairman of the inquiry into the investigation into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/may/18/youthjustice.politics\">murder of Damilola Taylor</a>, Sentamu brought with him an intimate knowledge of the impacts of institutional racism underwritten by his own personal experience. During his time in London, he was stopped and searched by the police eight times.&nbsp;There were other incidents, too: \u201cThere was a lady who didn\u2019t want me to take her husband\u2019s funeral because I was black... We received letters with excrement in.\u201d</p> <p>But it is Sentamu\u2019s strengths as an evangelist and his easy ability to connect with people that have propelled him through the hierarchy. A close attention to where he believes his faith is leading him, enabled through daily prayer, has led Sentamu to acts of public symbolism, most famously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/26/archbishop-york-john-sentamu-restores-dog-collar-shredded-2007-mugabe-protest\">cutting up his dog collar</a> live on air to highlight the abuses being carried out by the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe. He also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/aug/17/religion.uk\">set up a tent for a week in </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/aug/17/religion.uk\">York Minster</a> in order to fast and pray for peace in the Middle East.</p> <p>As archbishop, he has gathered bishops from across the north to go out together on missions to towns and cities where Sentamu would engage with anyone from shoppers to schoolchildren to talk about God. Over the past five years Sentamu\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.archbishopofyork.org/priorities/mission-and-evangelism/evangelism/archbishop-mission-weekends/transformation-north\">Northern Bishops\u2019 Missions</a> have taken place in Sheffield, Blackburn, Durham, Cumbria, Newcastle, Liverpool and Nottingham, with the final mission in York in March, just before the lockdown.</p> <p>Two years after his appointment as archbishop, Sentamu led a mission to Oxford University. Standing in the Sheldonian theatre, he recalled the words of a former archbishop, Michael Ramsey, who during his own mission to Oxford in 1960 spoke of the missionary century that saw the spread of Christian faith in Africa and Asia and compared it to the spiritual decay in England. Ramsey ended his address by saying: \u201cI should love to think of a black Archbishop of York holding a mission here and telling a future generation of the scandal and the glory of the church.\u201d</p> <p>There is little doubt that, even in his retirement, until his last breath, Sentamu will continue to advocate for the voiceless, speak out against injustice and tell of the glories of the Lord.</p> <p><em>Rev Arun Arora is the C of E\u2019s&nbsp;former director of communications and currently vicar of St Nicholas\u2019s Church, Co Durham</em></p> <p><strong>Born</strong>: John Tucker Mugabi Sentamu, 10 June 1949, near Kampala, Uganda.</p> <p><strong>Family</strong>: The sixth of 13 children.

It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics.</p>\n    <p>How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/singapore-coronavirus-increase-revives-fears-of-post-lockdown-surge\">resurgence in infections</a>&nbsp;despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.</p>\n    <p>Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/singapores-cramped-migrant-worker-dorms-hide-covid-19-surge-risk\">cramped dormitory accommodation</a>&nbsp;used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.</p>\n    <p>Singapore\u2019s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are experts worried about?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.</p>\n    <p>The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.</p>\n    <p>In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-we-have-one\">a vaccine still months away</a>, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterbeaumont\"><b>Peter Beaumont</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Yet we have only reached the halfway point of the disease\u2019s progress towards its first anniversary, timing that raises a host of concerns and questions about our ability to navigate our way through this pandemic. What exactly have we learned about Covid-19 over the past six months? How quickly and how well have we responded to the challenges posed by it?</p> \n<p>And, much more importantly, what questions do we most urgently need to answer over the next six months? Answers from researchers and doctors should tell us how we might survive one of the worst crises to affect humanity in modern times.</p> \n<p><strong>Were we ready?</strong></p> \n<p>One emphatic response from scientists stresses that it is now clear we were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/05/britain-emergency-planners-pandemic-government\">very badly prepared</a> for the arrival of Covid-19. \u201cThis disease has turned out to be much worse than any of the pandemics that we had been anticipating and making plans to counter,\u201d said Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt has a 1% death rate and it is highly transmissible, features that were considered to be highly unlikely for any new emerging disease we thought we might face. Such features represent the worst possible realistic scenario that we could envisage and lie at the very limit of what we thought we should expect. So the pandemic we have got now is about as bad as we thought it could ever get. It is a very sobering prospect.\u201d</p> \n<p>This point was also stressed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/dont-bet-on-vaccine-to-protect-us-from-covid-19-says-world-health-expert\">David Nabarro</a>, professor of global health at Imperial College London, and an envoy for the World Health Organization on Covid-19. \u201cWhen we first encountered this disease, we thought it was just a respiratory illness that affected the upper part of the chest. Now it is clear that it can cause illnesses of the sinus; can affect the lining of blood vessels and can lead to blood clots developing. The disease has also been linked to extreme fatigue, kidney damage and heart attacks \u2013 and quite often&nbsp;in relatively young people. This is not a disease to be underestimated.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa8569ed7f4f390fd696665c02d99d5d15205fb1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa8569ed7f4f390fd696665c02d99d5d15205fb1/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On 13 March, huge crowds gathered at the Cheltenham Festival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On 13 March, huge crowds gathered at the Cheltenham Festival.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacob King/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Nor is it likely to disappear in the near future, added Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Edinburgh University. \u201cHaving lived with Covid-19 for six months now, the most important thing we have learned is that we are going to have to live with it for an awful lot longer. Essentially we are six months into a lifelong relationship.\u201d</p> \n<p>In such circumstances, lockdown \u2013 which Woolhouse described as \u201ca panic measure\u201d but a necessary one \u2013 is no longer sustainable and the problem we face over the coming months is to find ways to keep the disease at bay without recourse to imposing lockdown restrictions and their associated economic and emotional harm. And that will not be easy \u2013 as has been made clear from other lessons learned over the past six months, Woolhouse added.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><strong>Disease of old age</strong></p> \n<p>\u201cThe one key feature that we have come to appreciate about Covid-19 is that it is a disease of old age,\u201d he said. \u201cThe chance that a person over 75 will die from it is actually 10,000 times greater than it is for a 15-year-old who gets infected. It is really striking.\u201d</p> \n<p>The problems concerning the disease\u2019s impact on adults start when a person reaches 50 and get exponentially greater for each additional year of age. \u201cThat means a significant proportion of our population \u2013 those over 75 \u2013 need protecting from this virus because its consequences for them are extremely serious,\u201d added Woolhouse. \u201cBut is it right to lock up grandchildren to save their grandparents? In a sense that is what we have been doing up until now.\u201d</p> \n<p>One idea would be to put extremely strict biosecurity systems around care homes to ensure the coronavirus never gets into them. Staff \u2013 from cleaners to carers \u2013 would be tested constantly for the presence of the virus. \u201cNobody would be allowed to enter without a same-day test,\u201d said Woolhouse. \u201cIt is as simple as that.\u201d</p> \n<p>But as Woolhouse acknowledged, the vast majority of those over 75 don\u2019t live in care homes. They live in their own houses. \u201cThat means we are going to have to invent the concept of household biosecurity for these people. That is one of the most urgent tasks we now face.\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>Test, test, test</strong></p> \n<p>Implementing such ideas has only become feasible because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/us-germ-warfare-lab-creates-test-for-pre-infectious-covid-19-carriers\">virus testing technology</a> has improved both in accuracy and scale over the past couple of months. And that offers other advantages and opportunities to understand other questions about Covid-19, said Anne Johnson, professor of epidemiology at University College London.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cUntil now we have been relying heavily on mathematical models to try to understand how the virus is behaving and spreading through communities. However, mathematical models are only as good as the data that underpins them.\u201d</p> \n<p>With the development of new virus and antibody tests, there should therefore be far greater, data-based understanding of the appearance and spread of Covid-19 cases in Britain. She said: <strong>\u201c</strong>Simple details of time, place and person \u2013 we are crying out for that information in order to really understand this epidemic. We have got to be forensic in our efforts to pinpoint chains of transmission so we can stamp them out.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Mathematical models are only as good as the data that underpins them</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Anne Johnson</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>A major problem in trying to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/covid-19-second-wave-may-be-avoided-with-track-and-trace-says-uk-science-chief\">track and control</a> Covid-19 has arisen because infections are often being spread by symptomless carriers, Johnson added. \u201cAt first we did not realise that people could be transmitting unwittingly. That has been a key lesson of the past few months.\u201d</p> \n<p>Collecting detailed epidemiological data should now be a priority for coming months, said Johnson. \u201cWhat is the age, gender, ethnicity and the postal code of people who test positive? And is that infected person a healthcare worker, or are they a relative of one, or are they living with one? Once you can establish these facts quickly, then you will make an enormous difference in closing down the disease. In effect, we are entering the realm of the bug detective.\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>Immunity</strong></p> \n<p>And then there is the critical issue of the kind of immunity that has been acquired by those already infected by the virus. \u201cStudies suggest antibodies are raised in patients\u2019 blood after they are infected and these could provide protection against future Covid-19 infections,\u201d said Hibberd. \u201cReasonable estimates suggest protection might last for periods of between six months to a couple of years. However, we need to find out exactly how long such protection will last because it will have an important bearing on how the disease progresses through a population.\u201d</p> \n<p>The longer that antibodies provide protection then the slower the disease will spread. As a result, scientists are asking that those individuals who were among the first to be infected have their blood sampled and their antibody levels tested. \u201cHave numbers of antibodies in their blood held steady or have they started to go down after only a few months? That is key research and it needs to be done now,\u201d said Hibberd.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a2947b48bb3e571469293f2f3feefd3036832bc\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a2947b48bb3e571469293f2f3feefd3036832bc/0_275_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People took no chances in Beijing after new year celebrations were cancelled in January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People took no chances in Beijing after new year celebrations were cancelled in January.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For those who were on the front line dealing with Covid-19 cases when significant numbers began to arrive in hospitals in April, the battle to save patients overwhelmed by critical breathing difficulties was a fraught and often bewildering business. Slowly doctors and nursing staff have improved treatments, however. \u201cWe are much better now at pinpointing those who will need intensive care and those who can be sent home,\u201d said Tom Wingfield, a clinician based at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd some promising techniques have emerged in the interim \u2013 such as the potential for continuous positive airway pressure machines, respirators that fit round your face, to help patients breathe. These are showing encouraging results.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, Wingfield stressed there were still many unknowns about the impact of Covid-19 on patients. \u201cFor example, it has become clear that many patients are having blood clots, and the sicker you are the more likely it is you have one. But what we don\u2019t know yet is which patients should be given blood thinners from the day they arrive to counter this clotting. Nor do we know how long we should continue that treatment.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe crucial point is that we are gathering data all the time \u2013 from blood tests, oxygen levels, respiratory rates \u2013 and hopefully that will help us to predict who is likely to have the worst reaction to the virus and who should be given the most intense treatments. In another six months, we should be much better informed.\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>Room for optimism</strong></p> \n<p>In the long term a vaccine may emerge as humanity\u2019s saviour. However, most scientists believe it is a relatively far-off prospect \u2013 one that is unlikely to reach us for a year or two at best. As Woolhouse put it: \u201cA vaccine is a hope, not a strategy.\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This point was also stressed by Nabarro: \u201cWe have got to get out of this mirage sense that all will be resolved when a vaccine appears at the end of this year to save us. That is not going to happen. And even when we do get a vaccine that is safe and works, there is still the issue of how we get it to the 7.8 billion people who inhabit our planet. The global eradication of a disease is a very, very difficult business. We managed it with polio eventually, but we are still trying to get rid of measles.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, there is still some room for optimism, say scientists. \u201cYes, a vaccine is some way off but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/01/uk-hospitals-trial-five-new-drugs-search-coronavirus-treatment\">antiviral therapies</a> look more hopeful,\u201d said Hibberd. \u201cTrials are now under way for a number of antiviral drugs that were developed to deal with other diseases but which are now being repurposed in the hope that they can be used to tackle Covid-19. Results are expected in a few months.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf successful, some of these could help cut death rates. We might get it from 1% right down to 0.1%. In combination with improved testing and greater understanding of our immune systems and antibody level responses to Covid-19, then I think we would find ourselves in a very different, much better position in six months. I am hopeful.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Britain is \u201cabsenting itself from the world stage\u201d by refusing to show leadership over Hong Kong residents, confront China or condemn President Trump over his handling of the fallout from George Floyd\u2019s killing, the shadow foreign secretary has warned.</p> <p>In her most stinging attack on Britain\u2019s foreign policy, Lisa Nandy said that the government was now displaying \u201ca pattern of behaviour that is becoming very, very troubling\u201d, and that the UK\u2019s actions were being noted by leaders around the world.</p> <p>In an interview with the <em>Observer</em>, Nandy suggested that the offer made by Boris Johnson to hand \u201ca route to citizenship\u201d to around three million Hong Kong residents eligible for a British National (Overseas) passport was too vague to be taken seriously by Beijing. Britain\u2019s reluctance to confront China was, however, part of a wider issue, she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8516c2a68ef851c94e56ff93c55336e647dd7a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8516c2a68ef851c94e56ff93c55336e647dd7a4/0_101_3437_2062/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A National Guard solider and a demonstrator in Washington last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A National Guard solider and a demonstrator in Washington last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Brandon/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis is a pattern of behaviour that is really deeply worrying,\u201d she added. \u201cWe have had the appalling scenes emerging from the US after the murder of George Floyd. Last weekend, the foreign secretary was asked what he made of that, and the way in which those protests have been handled. He said it wasn\u2019t appropriate for him to comment. The prime minister has been remarkably silent about that as well.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems to me that we lose all moral authority to talk about police brutality in Hong Kong and elsewhere if we are not prepared to apply those standards equally to other parts of the world. This is a pattern of behaviour that\u2019s becoming very, very troubling \u2013 that the UK is absenting itself from the world stage at precisely the moment when we need to show global leadership.\u201d</p> <p>Nandy praised the work of former Tory foreign secretary William Hague, but warned that British foreign policy had been \u201centirely framed through the lens of growth and trade\u201d since his departure in 2014.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThat has led us into a position where we have been courting the Chinese government, praising the golden era of Sino-British relations, without paying due attention to the need to have strategic independence and to be able to speak from a position of our values. And it seems to me that we are repeating those mistakes in the bilateral relationships we are trying to strike up across the world in the wake of Brexit.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d38b4c74b5c6927aa1ac3a0da346064c33671b28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d38b4c74b5c6927aa1ac3a0da346064c33671b28/0_164_5936_3563/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police officers on guard in Hong Kong last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police officers on guard in Hong Kong last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Miguel Candela/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nandy said that while the prime minister\u2019s offer to Hong Kong residents last week was \u201ca big step forward from a standing start of absolutely nowhere\u201d, there was a lack of clarity that meant anywhere between 350,000 and seven million Hong Kong residents could be affected. The offer was made as he urged China to rethink its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/china-vote-npc-national-security-laws-hong-kong-us-protest\">controversial security law</a>, which pro-democracy campaigners say threatens rights in Hong Kong.</p> <p>However, Nandy did not commit Labour to backing a scheme that would allow eligible Hong Kong residents to settle in the UK. \u201cThere\u2019s a moral case for ensuring that people who want to leave Hong Kong can and that they\u2019re provided with a safe haven elsewhere. But there is also a moral case to make sure that any sanctions that we pursue, while they have an impact on China, don\u2019t unduly harm the people of Hong Kong.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>She warned that the government\u2019s approach to the threat to Hong Kong was part of its wider reluctance to confront Beijing: \u201cWe need a strategy at home and we need a strategy abroad in relation to the rise of China \u2026 and at the moment, we\u2019ve got neither.\u201d</p> <p>She also criticised the decision to involve Huawei in the UK\u2019s 5G network, saying that a failure to develop domestic technology meant Britain was not in a \u201cposition of greatest strategic independence\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe government is likely to bring forward a bill before the summer recess to chart a path forwards that will reduce dependence on Huawei in the 5G network. We would support that \u2013 we\u2019ll obviously have to see the detail.</p> <p>\u201cAfter Huawei, there will be other issues. I think there\u2019s been a naivety about Britain\u2019s approach to China in the past decade. I think perhaps we\u2019re starting to see that change. And that is long overdue.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The day my mother\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/feb/28/sally-challen-wins-appeal-against-conviction-for-murdering-husband\" title=\"\">conviction for the murder of my father was quashed</a> marked a turning point \u2013 for our family and for society. Yet why, a year on from the landmark case that recognised the abuse my mother suffered, are we still failing victims of coercive control and seeing her story as unique?</p> <p>My mother, Sally, 66, is now discovering life as an independent woman for the first time since the age of 15, free from the coercion and control she experienced for over 40 years from my father. Watching her learning to make her own decisions while slowly unshackling from his spectre have been moments to cherish. Our journey has not been without difficulties \u2013 we\u2019ve had to learn how to acknowledge a life lost in my father and how to rebuild our relationships.</p> <p>My mother\u2019s story represented one of the worst cases of coercive control reported. She was only 15 when she met my father, who was 21. He was charismatic, funny and charming, and young love bloomed. However, early on, my mother challenged him about seeing another woman. He responded by dragging her down the stairs and throwing her out of the door. For the rest of her life she was scared to confront him in case he did it again. A culture of fear and dependency followed over the next 40 years. He bullied and humiliated her, isolated her from friends and family, controlled who she could socialise with, controlled her finances and restricted her movements.</p> <p>Coercive control, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/28/domestic-violence-law-coercive-control-abuse-partners-courts\" title=\"\">added to the statute book in 2015</a>, is no longer a new offence. Extensive training has been provided to police forces in England and Wales, yet we are still failing to correctly record it. Following recent reports of disparities between forces, Clare Walker, a domestic abuse consultant, said: \u201cThe police record domestic abuse wrongly. I know they do from reading their logs \u2026 name-calling and the like are not logged as domestic abuse.\u201d</p> <p>Coercive control offences doubled in the year ending March 2019, from 9,053 to 17,616. Considering that coercive control is the bedrock of domestic abuse, these figures show gross under-reporting. They represent a fraction of the 1,316,800 domestic-abuse-related incidents recorded by the police the same year.</p> <p>Calls to domestic abuse helplines have increased by up to 700% during the lockdown. Rachel Williams, who was shot and severely injured by her violent partner in 2011, says the government doesn\u2019t understand coercive control. \u201cGovernment needs to recognise coercive control because at the moment the impact to them of [physical] violence seems to be more severe, but when you speak to a victim they will tell you the mental torture far outweighs the physical. It certainly was for me,\u201d she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The long-awaited domestic abuse bill, now at the committee stage, offers a once-in-a-generation chance</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This failure to raise national awareness and correctly record offences of non-physical forms of abuse such as coercive control and economic abuse not only silences victims, it abandons them. Furthermore, the sustained mental impact on victims can raise the risk of suicide or \u2013 as in cases like my mother\u2019s \u2013 cause people to lose control and strike out at their abusers.</p> <p>It is a reality that my mother\u2019s case is not unique and that there are more women still in prison whose abuse has not been properly explored. The Centre for Women\u2019s Justice is currently supporting 13 women serving murder sentences and two serving excessive manslaughter tariffs where their abuse has not been taken into consideration. The charity plans to publish key research later this year on what is and isn\u2019t working within the justice system for women who kill in situations of abuse.</p> <p>Opportunities to better understand and tackle domestic abuse consistently present themselves in the voices of survivors and specialist services. Time and again these voices seem unheard and the urgency to tackle this epidemic is absent. The long-awaited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/08/theresa-may-domestic-violence-bill-women\" title=\"\">domestic abuse bill</a>, now at the committee stage, offers a once-in-a-generation chance to change our approach. Not only do we have an opportunity to better tackle domestic abuse, but to provide strategies and awareness to tackle its very heart: coercive control. Through relationship education and by including amendments that cover post-separation abuse (something my mother was subjected to), the chance to do this is now.</p> <p>Not being able to see my mother on the first anniversary of her freedom has been difficult, much as it has been for many families at this time. But, it has been a stark reminder of the near-decade she spent in prison. It has served as a reminder, too, of the many victims who remain isolated with their abusers, and the women in prison whose abuse has not properly been explored.</p> <p><em>David Challen is a domestic abuse campaigner; <a href=\"http://www.davidchallen.com/\" title=\"\">davidchallen.com</a></em></p> <p><em>National Domestic Abuse helpline 0808 2000 247</em></p>",

Academy headteachers have been \u201cinvited to order\u201d and some \u201chave done so\u201d, a DfE spokesperson said, but would not divulge numbers or say whether any of the devices ordered have been delivered.&nbsp;</p> <p>Matthew Shanks, deputy chief executive of the multi-academy trust Education South West, said he had ordered devices in April but none have been delivered. \u201cIt would have been quicker to have the funds and buy them ourselves. It is absolutely vital we are able to use these laptops with pupils to try to level the field.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIf the vast majority of learning is accessed online, it is not surprising that children whose parents are able to go out and buy them a device will succeed more than a child who has to access all learning from a phone or shared device.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve moved completely offline because we weren\u2019t willing to sacrifice 25% of our kids</p> <footer> <cite>Vic Goddard, headteacher</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>More than half (54%) of secondary school leaders say, as of this weekend, they have not received a single device, and 70% have not received the promised routers to give internet access for these pupils, according to a survey of 142 headteachers by the National Association of Headteachers. \u201cThis promise seems to be going unfulfilled,\u201d said Paul Whiteman, the union\u2019s general secretary. </p> <p>Vic Goddard, headteacher at Passmores Academy and a participant in the TV show <em>Educating Essex</em>, said a quarter of his Year 10 pupils have little or no access to the technology they needed for online learning during lockdown. \u201cWe\u2019ve moved completely offline because we weren\u2019t willing to sacrifice 25% of our kids. However, by doing that, the criticism we\u2019re open to is: you\u2019ve disadvantaged the advantaged kids.\u201d</p> <p>He has not received any of the devices he has requested, just emails from the Department for Education saying: you\u2019ll be contacted about how to order them. \u201cMy direct network would be about 50 heads from all over the country. None of them have heard anything different to that.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>A further six headteachers told the <em>Observer</em> they had not yet received any devices. Steve Howell, headteacher at the City of Birmingham School, is one of them. \u201cMore than three-quarters of our year 10 pupils do not have access, regularly and consistently, to a device or the internet at home,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that a big announcement was made about this before there was a practical mechanism for rollout. The most disadvantaged pupils are hardest hit with IT poverty, and the fact this has taken so long is really making things worse.\u201d </p> <p>The government\u2019s failure to deliver is effectively putting children without any tech under pressure to take greater health risks and return to school earlier than their peers, warned Jolyon Maugham, a barrister and founder of the <a href=\"https://goodlawproject.org/\">Good Law Project</a>.&nbsp;\u201cPoorer families are overwhelmingly the victims of the pandemic.

I wonder how the gap in their education is going to present itself and what has happened to them over the past 10 weeks. But my biggest anxiety is: is this going to work? Are we going to be able to keep everybody safe? Will all the children manage to stay in one \u201cbubble\u201d throughout the week?</p> <p>At the same time, I\u2019m feeling very, very excited. I always form such a strong connection to the children I teach and the thought that keeps going through my mind is: I\u2019m going to see some of them again. And the moment that I do, I feel overwhelmed with emotion. It was such a beautiful sunny day, and when each child came round the corner and we saw each other\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t stop smiling. Those were moments of complete and utter joy.</p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>I feel much less anxious today. The steps my leadership team has put in place have been very successful. The children may be only five or six years old, but they have learned to line up two metres apart, put hand gel on when they arrive and sit at individual desks spread out around the room. Normally, I teach the children through play, we don\u2019t have formal desks at all. But they are now taking pride in their desks and saying \u201cI\u2019ve got to keep it tidy\u201d.</p> <p>Throughout the week, the children seem fully aware of the virus and what\u2019s been happening. Today, when we speak about the continent of Asia, straightaway one of the children says: \u201cThat\u2019s where the coronavirus comes from.\u201d My teaching assistant and I look at each other. Asia has such a rich culture and history. For a child to immediately think of that\u2026 This is how the real world is imprinting itself on our young children.</p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>The children are learning about Saint George, so I get them to describe and draw their own dragons.</p> <p>Normally, I teach a mixed class of 30 Year 1 and Year 2 pupils, but only nine of them have come into school this week. We are all in one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/19/distanced-drop-offs-and-protective-bubbles-englands-new-school-rules\">\u201cbubble\u201d</a> together. My teaching assistant supervises them when I have my lunch or a break, and vice versa, so no other adult ever enters our bubble.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to keep your distance from a small child \u2013 sometimes they just want to come up to you and hold your hand. My biggest concern is to keep the children\u2019s anxieties to a minimum. That comes first, for me, so I am prepared to let them get a bit close.</p> <p>After a socially distanced ice-cream on the school playing field with other staff members, I hear on the news the death toll is rising again. My mother calls me to say she wouldn\u2019t have sent her child back to school this week \u2013 but she didn\u2019t have a choice. I find myself hoping, beyond anything, that going back was the right decision.</p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>We play socially distanced golf this morning. It\u2019s not a sport I\u2019ve taught before, it\u2019s not on our normal curriculum but it was fantastic. When the children\u2019s balls land in the \u201cpond\u201d I have created from a big water tray, they have to whack them out of the water \u2013 and they can\u2019t stop laughing.</p> <p>I can tell one little boy is missing his best friend though. Usually, they\u2019re inseparable \u2013 but his friend isn\u2019t coming in, so he seems a bit lost. I try my best to help. I miss the other children in the class, too.</p> <p>From the news that evening, I learn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/face-masks-to-be-made-compulsory-on-public-transport-in-england\">face masks will soon be compulsory on public transport</a>. Yet the government is happy for teachers to be confined in classrooms with up to 15 children all day long. That was interesting.</p> <h2>Friday</h2> <p>Today the children re-enact the Roman invasion of the hometown of Boudica, the warrior queen. Normally, we dedicate a whole term to a single topic or theme, but this week I\u2019ve been trying to spark their curiosity about learning again. There are no end of year assessments, like there usually are, so I can use this time to really explore and fill the different gaps in their knowledge.</p> <p>It takes a lot of energy to teach young children and when I leave, I am tired. I want to collapse on the sofa. But I have been back in the classroom, where I should be, seeing children smile again and having an impact on their learning. And that has felt incredible.</p>",
  "<p>Sonia Shah\u2019s last two books <em>Pandemic</em>, published in 2016, and <em>The Fever</em>, published in 2010, introduced her as a storyteller in a novel genre: travel books that went in search of the spread of disease - cholera in the former, malaria in the latter. That literature of track and trace, part detective story, part reportage, took Shah to remote corners of the world and to distant grid references of history. Her books were also prescient case studies of the way that human progress has been shaped by its love-hate relationship with microbes \u2013 how disease has caused empires to rise and fall and economies to stutter and implode.&nbsp;</p> <p>This book \u2013 a wandering narrative about why people wander \u2013 is likely to prove equally prophetic in the coming months and years, since it asks two questions that are already shaping our geopolitics: what causes human beings to migrate? And is such mass movement beneficial to more settled communities and nations?&nbsp;</p> <p>The \u201cnext great migration\u201d has been predicted by many \u2013 and feared by some \u2013&nbsp;ever since the end of the cold war.&nbsp;The national security expert <a href=\"https://www.robertdkaplan.com/\">Robert D</a><a href=\"https://www.robertdkaplan.com/\"> Kaplan</a> described it in a 1994 <em>Atlantic</em> magazine article as \u201cthe coming anarchy\u201d \u2013 the binary superpowers had held borders mostly in check, now people would start to move. \u201cThere would likely be 50 million on the move by 2020, experts at the United Nations University projected. Two hundred million by 2050, the environmental security analyst Norman Myers announced. One billion! the NGO Christian Aid projected.\u201d One result of those alarmist predictions had been the populist politics that has emerged with a single purpose in mind: how to make those people stay still. \u201cEnd freedom of movement!\u201d; \u201cbuild the wall!\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p><a href=\"http://soniashah.com/\">Shah</a> begins her history with a series of observations that become parables from the natural world. The first concerns the habits and behaviour of the checkerspot butterfly. The checkerspot, most abundant on the west coast of America, is not a powerful creature. It flies very low to the ground and only lives for 10 days. Because of its sensitivity to changes in habitat and environment, it also proved one of the first bellwethers of climate change. A celebrated paper in <em>Nature</em> in 1996 showed that in response to warming temperatures the edges of the population of checkerspots were moving northwards at a rate of 20km per decade. Shah joined the butterfly hunters marking that progress and along the way found evidence that myriad other species are also checking out of familiar territories: Atlantic cod, for example, are moving at a rate of 200km a decade toward the cooler poles.</p> <p>Shah confesses to a certain kinship with those migrations. Her parents \u2013 alone among their siblings \u2013 moved from India 50 years ago to fulfil a need for doctors in New York City, in the first wave of legal migration from the subcontinent. That migration instilled in Shah \u201can acute feeling of being somehow out of place\u201d; despite having been born American, \u201cI didn\u2019t consider myself as being \u2018from\u2019 that place, even though I\u2019d borne both of my children there\u201d. For a few years, she and her husband left to live in Australia and became doubly \u201calien\u201d. These feelings prompted questions in Shah: where did that concept of home originate? And was that a learned or an innate understanding?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nigel Farage\u2019s efforts to police the English Channel are about as likely to succeed as those of King Canute</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her compulsive investigation into these questions becomes a political history of the human urge to move from one place to another. It begins with the \u201cmitochondrial Eve\u201d identified as the African ancestor of all human societies \u2013 the prime mover of a species hardwired to migrate \u2013 and ends in the determined and futile efforts of contemporary politicians to deny that instinct in individual refugees with nowhere to go except somewhere else.&nbsp;</p> <p>Shah identifies the emergence of biological taxonomy, the naming of things, as the historical moment when we decided that nature, which had never stopped moving and evolving, was actually fixed. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/13/wikipedia-influence-list-carl-linnaeus\">Carl Linnaeus</a>, \u201cthe sex-crazed Swedish taxonomist\u201d, becomes the founding father of a political principle of nativism that can be summed up simply: \u201cWe belong here. They belong there.\u201d She shows how this enlightenment control freakery gave rise not only to eugenics and \u201crace science\u201d but also to the underpinnings of fascism. Heinrich Himmler, in addition to masterminding the genocide of millions, issued rules for landscape design: \u201cThe head of the Reich central office for \u2018Vegetation Mapping\u2019 called the delicate flowering herb <em>Impatiens parviflora</em> a \u2018Mongolian invader\u2019 and recommended its extermination.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8724911c84b266d7e970e0fd988e941556b3feef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8724911c84b266d7e970e0fd988e941556b3feef/0_0_4016_6016/668.jpg\" alt=\"Sonia Shah: \u2018asks the questions that are already shaping our geopolitics\u2019\" width=\"668\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sonia Shah: \u2018asks the questions that are already shaping our geopolitics\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Having established this history, Shah unpicks its pernicious effects on contemporary false narratives about immigration and the re-emergence of supremacist racial rhetoric in the political mainstream. It is only two decades since Bill Clinton stood on the White House steps and announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2000/jun/26/genetics13\">the sequencing of the human genome</a>, which offered incontrovertible proof that we not only have infinitely more in common than that which divides us \u2013 \u201cThe sequencers had found [that] a paltry 0.1% of the 3bn nucleotides strung together on our strands of DNA differed from any one person to the next\u201d \u2013 but that encoded in our DNA was the age-old urge to mix and move about.</p> <p>Towards the end of this fascinating study, Shah travels to some of the frontlines of the denial of that instinct. She meets the gravediggers of the Greek island of Lesbos, who bury the migrants who wash up on their shores, many of them children, in unmarked graves. She has no easy answers, except to argue that our biology and our history tell us a very different story to our politicians. Nigel Farage\u2019s efforts to police the English Channel are about as likely to succeed as those of King Canute. \u201cLife is on the move, today as in the past,\u201d Shah insists. \u201cFor too long, we\u2019ve suppressed the fact of the migration instinct, demonising it as a harbinger of terror. We\u2019ve constructed a story about ourselves, our history, our bodies, and the natural world around us in which migration is the anomaly. It\u2019s an illusion. And once it falls, the entire world shifts.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Next Great Migration: The Story of Movement on a Changing Planet</em> by Sonia Shah is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a314.99).

These are just three examples of ordinary people who have responded in extraordinary ways. Their actions speak of selflessness, defiance and bravery in the face of the invisible threat that hovers around us in the very air that we breathe. But they also provide us with glimpses of the immense human cost of the pandemic, the great well of loss, fear, sadness and grief beneath the mounting statistics.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Britain, as I write, 37,000 people have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/01/coronavirus-uk-map-the-latest-deaths-and-confirmed-cases-near-you\">lost their lives</a> to the Covid-19 virus, while 267,000 have experienced and survived the terrible uncertainty of infection. As a fragile normality slowly returns, many mental health experts are asking the inevitable questions: what will be the long-term emotional and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/urgent-studies-needed-mental-health-coronavirus-lockdown\">psychological cost</a> of such a sudden and seismic disruption of our way of life?</p> <p>\u201cHow the outside impacts on the inside is something that people like me think about all the time,\u201d says psychotherapist and author <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/susie-orbach\">Susie Orbach</a>. \u201cBut now we are seeing it on a grand scale. The pandemic has been a prolonged assault from outside on our community. The state of uncertainty and unsafety it has created is new and utterly unfamiliar. Unless you are a refugee who has risked their life to get here, or a survivor of childhood abuse that could not be escaped, there is simply nothing to compare it to.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eceac7aaf1ea9f3150268c9a61a1682a7ad772fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eceac7aaf1ea9f3150268c9a61a1682a7ad772fe/0_0_1142_1252/912.jpg\" alt=\"Rose \u2018Billy\u2019 Mitchell\" width=\"912\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rose \u2018Billy\u2019 Mitchell, who died in a nursing home in London.

Leaving aside the probability of another spike, the aftershock of the pandemic is likely to last a long time and leave yet more casualties in its wake.&nbsp;</p> <p>Jo Stubley, a consultant psychiatrist and clinical psychoanalyst at the Tavistock and Portman clinic in London, is a specialist in trauma who has worked with survivors of the London terrorist attacks and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/grenfell-tower-fire\">Grenfell Tower</a> disaster. Those kinds of emergencies, she explains, are classed as \u201csingle events that occur within a limited time-frame and affect a defined population\u201d. A global pandemic does not fit that model.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For those with a history of trauma, it has been a particularly difficult time</p> <footer> <cite>Susie Orbach</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe word most often used is \u2018unprecedented\u2019,\u201d she says, \u201cand it looks increasingly likely that the long-term consequences will also be unprecedented in scale. Given that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/mental-health\">mental health services</a> have been starved of resources for years, one can only imagine the impact that a deep recession will have on an already beleaguered sector. So there is a lot of concern among health care professionals like myself about what will happen next.\u201d</p> <p>It is in the coming months and even years, then, that the psychological effects of the pandemic will become most apparent. \u201cTrauma occurs when you are overwhelmed by an event that you cannot process,\u201d says Julia Samuel, grief counsellor and bestselling author, whose latest book is titled <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/12/grief-works-stories-life-death-and-surviving-review-julia-samuel\">Grief Works: Stories of Life, Death and Surviving</a></em>. \u201cWhile the crisis is happening, you are in it and everything is uncertain and unpredictable. You don\u2019t have the emotional freedom to allow yourself to process the trauma, so it is held in the body. The most common reaction is to shut down and just exist somehow. It is only when the external world becomes more safe and predictable again that people may feel able to reach out for support.\u201d</p> <p>Those most at risk of suffering post-traumatic stress are the frontline medical staff who, in the first chaotic weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic, may have felt overwhelmed&nbsp;by the dramatically increased levels of patient suffering and deaths, as well as at risk from infection from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/19/medical-staff-face-weeks-without-protective-gowns\">inadequate PPE</a> and anxious about bringing the virus home with them.&nbsp;</p> <p>Studies have also shown that, in ordinary times,&nbsp;patients who have spent time in intensive care are at a 20% increased risk of developing PTSD. \u201cAlready with some of the support initiatives that have been put in place, we are seeing survivors of Covid-19 showing post-traumatic symptoms,\u201d says Stubley. She explains that there is an accepted timeline for the&nbsp;treatment of post-traumatic stress. \u201cTime zero is the moment the trauma itself ends. In the first months or so afterwards, around 90% of those who experienced trauma will have PTS symptoms including feeling edgy or constantly on guard, sleeplessness, irritability and acute anxiousness. The Nice [National Institute for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/health\">Health</a>&nbsp;and Care Excellence] guidelines state that we should not treat people in that first month as these symptoms can often pass.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f611ba1ff8dc340d8e21e94606dfb86a9129b8a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f611ba1ff8dc340d8e21e94606dfb86a9129b8a1/0_174_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Radiologists with a patient at the Royal Blackburn teaching hospital\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Radiologists with a patient at the Royal Blackburn teaching hospital in east Lancashire. \u2018Nurses and doctors will suddenly be thinking: \u2018My God!

The third stage, PTSD, which will affect around 10% of those who have experienced a traumatic event, is a kind of prolonged shutdown. \u201cPeople&nbsp;dissociate from their feelings, go numb,\u201d says Stubley. \u201cIt can last for years and years.\u201d</p> <p>Her main concern, though, is for those already in the mental health system, for whom lockdown has already had a major impact. It is an anxiety shared by many therapists, who have been unable to see their patients face to face throughout the lockdown period, instead hosting online sessions.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ac1373921e9634bcb31f010605820acb262eda9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac1373921e9634bcb31f010605820acb262eda9f/0_0_3142_4028/780.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by Jacob Stead of a coronavirus wrecking ball\" width=\"780\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by Jacob Stead.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFor those with a history of trauma,\u201d says Orbach, \u201cit has been a particularly difficult time, not just because of the loneliness and isolation, but because it may also have re-stimulated past traumas. There is so much about the pandemic that is disturbing and distressing on so many levels.\u201d</p> <p>The Royal College of Surgeons recently carried out research into the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on healthcare workers, gathering personal testimonies from nurses and doctors on the frontline. Many reported experiencing increased levels of anxiety, stress, depression as well as panic attacks and bouts of guilt about the amount of people who have died. \u201cI can\u2019t see how I can keep doing this...\u201d said one. \u201cI really wish I wasn\u2019t a doctor,\u201d said another.&nbsp;</p> <p>Writing in the <em>Guardian</em>, lead researcher and NHS doctor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/28/coronavirus-mental-health-storm-nhs-workers\">Ankur Khajuria</a> noted that even before the pandemic around 50% of doctors and 40% of nurses were suffering from stress-related psychiatric illness. \u201cA perfect storm is gathering,\u201d he warned.&nbsp;</p> <p>Lucy Warner is chief executive of NHS Practitioner Health, a confidential service that treats doctors with mental health issues. They expect to treat around 3,500 doctors a year. When I spoke to her a few weeks ago, she said they had already treated about a third of that annual number in the preceding few weeks \u2013 \u201cmostly through online spaces where people can connect, talk to each other, share their feelings and reflect.\u201d</p> <p>In the early stage of the pandemic, she says, \u201cthere was a lot of anticipatory anxiety. It was new and people didn\u2019t really know what was happening or how long it would go on, but they knew it was frightening.\u201d As the weeks have passed in long shifts and rising numbers of the sick and the dead, that gave way to \u201ca lot of emotional fatigue, a kind of mental and physical exhaustion. It was becoming a toil, it was becoming difficult for doctors to go on while not knowing how the pandemic would play out.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Over the last months, that state of mental and physical fatigue has for many become the default mode. \u201cIn a way, it no longer feels like a break with the norm,\u201d says Warner, \u201cit just feels normal.\u201d&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is a long game.

We are seeing the beginnings of a surge in mental health issues among frontline staff, but over the next year or more we are going to see a lot of people who thought they were OK suddenly realising that they are not. There will be some nurses and doctors suddenly thinking: \u2018My God! What did I go through?\u2019 That\u2019s when we may have to deal with a surge in PTSD symptoms, and those people will need individual support but also support on an organisational level.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>While the government and some media were quick to apply the language of wartime to the pandemic \u2013 heroic British frontline warriors battling an invisible enemy \u2013&nbsp;Jo Stubley told me of her and her colleagues\u2019 discomfort at that kind of distracting rhetoric. \u201cThe NHS is not the military,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cand nurses are not soldiers.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Like several others I spoke to, Warner was also uncomfortable with what she called \u201cthe hero narrative\u201d that has taken hold of the public imagination during the long weeks of lockdown. \u201cIt is unhelpful in some ways because you don\u2019t want doctors and nurses to feel they are superheroes, who have to pat themselves on the back when they are on the line and not sleeping or even having time for a pee. What can tend to get overlooked is that they are human beings who are entitled to a rest as much as we all are. They are ordinary people doing their very best, but we need them to be well to do their jobs well.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"521f0dd019d70b6eb79df121b96e4960290a5608\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/521f0dd019d70b6eb79df121b96e4960290a5608/0_0_6366_4244/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Doctors hold a silent protest outside Downing Street on 28 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doctors hold a silent protest outside Downing Street on 28 May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In response to the emergency of the last few months, several psychotherapists have set up online drop-in support groups for NHS staff, who may be feeling overwhelmed or emotionally exhausted. I spoke to one who, with a colleague, has created \u201ca support group for clinical staff\u201d in London. She asked for anonymity.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe first thing to stress is that it is drop-in support, not psychotherapy \u2013 the midst of a crisis is not the time to start psychotherapy for clinical staff. What they need is a safe space to come together, share their thoughts and anxieties and listen to others experiencing similar challenges. To this end, everyone uses first names only and they do not have to say where they work. They can also choose to be seen on a screen or not.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps surprisingly, the take-up rate has been low and almost all those who have used the service are doctors rather than nurses. \u201cI think there are various reasons for that,\u201d she says. \u201cFirst, they are in it, and when they get home, they are utterly exhausted. Also, they are perhaps not aware of what help has been made available to NHS staff, even though there is actually a lot of help out there.\u201d</p> <p>The other more positive reason is that they may already be receiving support from their fellow workers, from the strength of being part of a team that is responding well in extremely difficult circumstances. \u201cThe way the nursing profession works is that you tend to get on with it,\u201d says Jo Stubley. \u201cYou are to a degree encouraged to feel that way, so even when the normal rules don\u2019t apply there is the sense that this is what you have been trained for. It\u2019s amazing in many ways, but it means that everybody seems to be coping on the surface, while underneath they may well be struggling.\u201d&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c42b8375c853090a7e3e4273f60634fb6d232244\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c42b8375c853090a7e3e4273f60634fb6d232244/0_206_4687_2814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Medical staff at the Royal Blackburn teaching hospital.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Medical staff at the Royal Blackburn teaching hospital.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah McKay/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the first chaotic weeks of the Covid pandemic, many nurses and doctors felt not just overwhelmed, but threatened and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/worrying-event-deaths-of-nhs-doctors-from-covid-19-stark-reminder-of-pandemic\">unsafe</a>. There were serious issues over the lack of adequate PPE,&nbsp;leading to increased anxiety about contracting the virus and passing it on to family members. Both the workplace and the home thus became places that were unsafe and uncertain.&nbsp;</p> <p>The nurse from Sierra Leone quoted at the beginning of this article recalled her feelings of being alone, at risk and anxious. \u201cInitially it was chaos \u2013 we didn\u2019t have equipment, we didn\u2019t have senior support, we were short-staffed.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>For two long weeks, she and her colleagues worked in an environment she compared to a war zone, tending to patients who were \u201cvery unwell, very unstable, very sick... We didn\u2019t even have masks. We were tired, dehydrated, thirsty,\u201d she continued, still sounding traumatised. She recalled returning home each night to her daughters, thinking: \u201cWhat is happening? How far will this go?\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>That anonymous nurse belongs to the BAME community who make up 20% of the NHS workforce. On 25 May, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/six-in-10-uk-health-workers-killed-by-covid-19-are-bame\">the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/six-in-10-uk-health-workers-killed-by-covid-19-are-bame\">Guardian</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/six-in-10-uk-health-workers-killed-by-covid-19-are-bame\"> reported</a> that 200 healthcare workers had died from Covid-19. More than six out of 10 victims were from BAME backgrounds. One of their number was urologist Abdul Mabud Chowdhury, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/six-in-10-uk-health-workers-killed-by-covid-19-are-bame\">18-year-old son voiced</a> what many inside the NHS were feeling. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see NHS workers getting the recognition they deserve,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they should not have to give their lives, they should not have to go as martyrs. They did not sign up to battle on the frontline and give up their lives.\u201d</p> <p>In the coming second pandemic of mental health issues, it may well be those we heralded as heroes who will be among the most vulnerable, alongside key workers on low incomes who also toiled through this long emergency at considerable and often unnecessary risk to their health, their lives.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIf we were prepared to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/28/clap-for-our-carers-the-very-unbritish-ritual-that-united-the-nation\">clap for our health workers</a>, we should also be insisting that they are looked after in the wake of this emergency,\u201d says Jo Stubley. \u201cI want to be optimistic about that, but the market economy has been a disaster for the health service and, within it, mental health has always been the poor sibling. I have spent years saying to my managers, we need more resources, too many people are waiting. If there was no room in the system before this began, what will happen when it ends and we are in the middle of another recession?\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Julia Samuel concurs: \u201cThe fear is that the system will be overwhelmed, not least because there is not the parity of resources in mental health that there is in physical health.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You don\u2019t expect to lose someone in this way.

In time to come, hard questions must surely be asked about the British death rate and the practical ways many thousands of those deaths might have been prevented. For now, it is the hardest aspect of the pandemic to grasp, much less make sense of. Only months ago, it would have seemed like the stuff of dark imaginings: gothic fiction or apocalyptic sci-fi. How swiftly it has become real; all too real.&nbsp;</p> <p>On Sunday 24 May, <em>The New York Times</em> filled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/new-york-times-front-page-1000-covid-19-death-notices\">its entire front page</a> with death notices from across America, a bold statement that nevertheless only hinted at the immensity of the human toll: 1,000 victims symbolising around 100,000. Outside of wartime or other historical pandemics like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/us-responses-1918-flu-pandemic-offer-stark-lessons-coronavirus-now\">Spanish flu in 1918</a>, there is no precedent for the number of lives lost within a relatively short period.&nbsp;</p> <p>The global virus has, in the most insidious and cruelly indiscriminate way, turned our world upside down, denting our faith in the infallibility of science and medicine, global capitalism and in progress itself. It has made us fretful for our lives and the lives of those around us, while simultaneously robbing us even of our traditional way of death. Relatives have not been allowed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/may/05/dying-surrounded-by-family-a-fundamental-right-says-uk-judge\">visit their loved ones in their final days</a> or to be present when they breathed their last.

Without a feathered kiss upon her forehead.&nbsp;</p> <p>Without the muted murmur of familiar family voices gathered around her bed...</p> </blockquote> <p>In composing that sad, defiant elegy, Duffy found a way to express her tumult of emotions in the face of the virus\u2019s assault on our collective sensibilities. In this, though, she was undoubtedly the exception. Countless others have not found a way to articulate their sorrow, their isolation and their disorientation. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect to lose someone in this way,\u201d says Orbach, \u201cto not be able to say goodbye and then to be forced to grieve alone.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>For Orbach, the pandemic has also brutally exposed our culture\u2019s collective denial of the final inevitable. \u201cThe rituals are there to help us get through it,\u201d she elaborates, \u201cbut also because death is such a problematic idea in our culture, an almost impossible idea. We don\u2019t live with death, as it were. Instead, we live to a great degree in denial of it, particularly our own death. And suddenly, we are witnessing death on a grand scale. It has in effect cut through our belief systems, our expectations of what life is.\u201d</p> <p>As someone who specialises in grief, what does Julia Samuel think will be the lasting collective impact of so many deaths, but also of our prolonged proximity to the threat of death?</p> <p>\u201cThe impact will by no means be the same for everyone,\u201d she says. \u201cFor an older person to lose a long-term partner so suddenly and unexpectedly is a different experience to a family who have lost someone young who was expected to survive. Both traumas will leave a deep and lasting imprint on their family members.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Samuel points out that guilt is often a component of grief, and may be exacerbated by the ways in which people have died during the pandemic. \u201cTo be the only family member permitted to be present in an ICU is heartbreaking of itself, but then to have to be in full PPE, while your loved one is on a ventilator surrounded by medical staff who also look like astronauts. It is as good as it can be, but it is not the death that anyone would wish for.\u201d</p> <p>I ask Julia Samuel&nbsp;if there is any way to accurately predict what the long-term fallout of the pandemic will be\u2026</p> <p>\u201cAs humans, we are born to adapt,\u201d she says. \u201cBut while we are still in it and so much is still uncertain, I don\u2019t think we have a clue what the long-term consequences will be.\u201d&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2a080c6ffeeaf817dc0dd88aaaf11df66121fb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2a080c6ffeeaf817dc0dd88aaaf11df66121fb7/186_396_5122_3073/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A burial plot\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fresh burial plot in Oxfordshire.

The badge of busyness, for instance, has to a degree lost its lustre. Being busy was somehow being important, but maybe people have realised that busyness is essentially an anaesthetic to feeling.\u201d</p> <p>I ask Susie Orbach the same question. She, too, attests to the power of not being frantic.&nbsp;\u201cThe lockdown certainly changed our relationship to time. In the beginning, there was a kind of panic about time running though our hands \u2013 it was two o\u2019clock and suddenly it\u2019s five o\u2019clock. How did that happen? I think not being frantic was a challenge for some people, but for others, the not-doing and simply being became almost mindful. To just be is actually quite liberating.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Will these small epiphanies be enough for the reorientation of our social and political values that some have suggested will be the necessary outcome of this global emergency?&nbsp;Writer and activist Arundhati Roy <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10d8f5e8-74eb-11ea-95fe-fcd274e920ca\">has described the pandemic</a> as \u201ca portal, a gateway between one world and the next\u201d. We can, she suggested, \u201cchoose to walk through it, dragging the carcasses of our prejudice and hatred, our avarice, our data banks and dead ideas, our dead rivers and smoky skies behind us. Or we can walk through lightly, with little luggage, ready to imagine another world. And ready to fight for it.\u201d</p> <p>Orbach&nbsp;cautiously agrees. \u201cPart of me thinks that this is somehow a moment of possibility. Many of us who believe we need to work together to democratise our institutions saw that actually happen when the doctors and nurses took control on the ground, while management did not have a clue.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>She pauses for a moment, gathering her thoughts. \u201cIn terms of our political culture, we entered the pandemic with a government born of fright. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/26/the-observer-view-on-the-danger-posed-by-brexit-during-our-greatest-vulnerability\">Brexit</a> was essentially an act of fright, and the climate of fear that was created left so many people feeling marginalised in this swashbuckling, Darwinian, self, self, self culture. And yet, against all that, when the pandemic happened and real fear spread among us, people wanted to make a contribution, they wanted to be decent.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>The experts agree that the psychological fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic will be felt for some time to come and that, as ever, the most vulnerable, no matter their recent sacrifices, will be most at risk. In the new normal, will we find ways to be fairer, kinder, more decent when this is all over, if it can ever be said to be truly over?&nbsp;Or will today\u2019s \u201cheroes\u201d become tomorrow\u2019s overlooked victims like the traumatised veterans of so many wars we willed ourselves so quickly to forget?&nbsp;</p> <p>Will we hold our political leaders to account when the coming economic crisis inevitably takes precedence over the psychological one and already limited resources are channeled away from a beleaguered NHS that nevertheless saved us from an even deeper, darker abyss?&nbsp;Or will we simply get on with it as before, finding ways to forget that, for a long, uncertain time, when time itself seemed out of joint, we lived amid the mounting dead in a world turned upside down. Ultimately, how we respond to this looming second pandemic may be the measure of how much the first one really taught us about ourselves and the kind of world we want to live in.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022&nbsp;<em>In the UK and Ireland,&nbsp;Samaritans&nbsp;can be contacted on 116 123 or email&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

  "<p>The political obituaries of Donald Trump were all prepared. At the end of a week that has seen American cities convulsed by protests over the killing of <a href=\"heguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jun/05/george-floyd-protests-donald-trump-hydroxychloroquine-live\" title=\"\">George Floyd</a>, the president would be faced with an increase in unemployment worse than anything seen in the Great Depression.</p> <p>Well, it didn\u2019t turn out like that. The US economy actually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/05/us-unemployment-may-great-depression-job-loss\" title=\"\">created 2.5 million jobs in May</a> and the unemployment rate went down rather than up. The consensus among analysts was that it would shed 7.5 million jobs, a colossally wrong call. And a deeply significant one.</p> <p>Instead of Trump being the new Herbert Hoover \u2013 the one-term occupant of the White House from 1929-33 \u2013 the amazingly good jobs figures hold out the prospect of him stealing Bill Clinton\u2019s nickname and being the next comeback kid.</p> <p>The US has a reputation for bouncing back from adversity quickly, but even by its own standards the turnaround has been remarkable. If the data from the Bureau for Labour Statistics (BLS) are to be believed, large numbers of workers who lost their jobs when the economy went lockdown in March were rehired as restrictions were eased from mid-May onwards. On Thursday, the day before the official payroll data was released, there had been figures out showing almost 2 million Americans had filed jobless claims the previous week, taking the total to more than 40 million since the crisis began.</p> <p>Trump seemed as surprised as anyone by the news, but for once his hyperbole was fully justified. The president tweeted that the numbers were incredible, stunning and stupendous \u2013 as indeed they were. He also praised himself for the sudden reversal of fortune, which was less justified. If any one man can claim credit, it is the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, who acted early and acted big to provide record amounts of stimulus.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s no getting away from the fact that this was good news for Trump at a time when he appeared to be overwhelmed by a triple-whammy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Stock markets soared on the news. For days, equity prices have been rising amid optimism about a V-shaped recession, even though there has been little hard evidence to support this view. Now there is. The BLS said there had been sharp increases in hiring in those sectors especially hard hit by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\" title=\"\">Covid-19</a> lockdown: hospitality, leisure, retail, construction and education. Average earnings also fell, a sign that the lower-paid employees that bore the brunt of the pandemic-induced layoffs have started to find work again.</p> <p>All that said, the labour market is still a long way from being in the sort of rude health that an incumbent president would wish it to be five months before an election. The number of job losses for March was revised up, meaning that employment in the US has fallen by 20 million since peaking earlier this year. The unemployment rate has almost quadrupled from 3.5% to 13.3% and social distancing is likely to mean that the pace of hiring will be slower than it would be otherwise. There could be a second wave of the virus when temperatures start to drop in the autumn.</p> <p>But there\u2019s no getting away from the fact that this was good news for Trump at a time when he appeared to be overwhelmed by a triple-whammy of coronavirus, street protests and rising unemployment. He will now be hopeful of further falls in unemployment as lockdown restrictions are eased in the densely populated north-eastern states, and that the better jobs news will continue to keep the stock market running hot.</p> <p>None of which is to say that Trump will get a second term come November. But if he does, the May jobs report will have proved to have been a decisive moment.</p> <h2>Facebook\u2019s stance on presidential tweets risks a staff exodus</h2> <p>Compare the responses of two social media giants to President Trump\u2019s threat to Americans protesting about the death of George Floyd at the hands of police. \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts,\u201d Trump tweeted, later claiming that he had been ignorant of the rhyme\u2019s racist origins.</p> <p>Both Facebook and Twitter hosted the message, but the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\" title=\"\">latter quickly distanced itself from the president\u2019s words</a>, hiding the post on the grounds that it glorified violence. In a bold move, a private company censored the White House.</p> <p>Facebook, on the other hand, took a long hard look at what Trump had said and shrugged its shoulders. Its founder and boss, Mark Zuckerberg, said Facebook was aware of the racist resonance of the president\u2019s comment but had a policy of allowing states to warn the public about the potential use of force.</p> <p>Reports of Facebook\u2019s demise are usually premature, but this could yet prove a defining moment.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t so much that Facebook risks sparking an exodus of socially conscious young people. After all, it is already the social network of their parents\u2019 generation rather than their own. Its users are, typically, a cohort who have little appetite for migrating to new platforms but who wield the kind of spending power that keeps advertising dollars rolling in.</p> <p>The Silicon Valley starlets who keep Facebook at the cutting edge of progress might prove more of a problem. Its staff are famed for their almost cultish devotion to Zuckerberg\u2019s empire but their dear leader\u2019s stance has sparked insurrection. Hundreds staged a walkout while several came forward to condemn Zuckerberg\u2019s stance. Some have even quit in disgust.</p> <p>Facebook has no shortage of brilliant engineers queuing up to work at the company. But in the fast-evolving world of Silicon Valley, it needs to attract and retain the very best. Many of them may now be looking elsewhere.</p> <h2>This crisis must not become a reason to postpone climate action</h2> <p>For those hoping the coronavirus crisis might be the moment to steer Britain towards a greener, cleaner future, the publication of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/04/chemicals-firm-basf-biggest-beneficiary-of-uk-coronavirus-loan-scheme\" title=\"\">list of companies who have benefited from the Bank of England\u2019s cheap Covid-19 loans</a> will have made depressing reading. Airlines and car manufacturers are among the major beneficiaries.</p> <p>That list was disclosed amid revelations that the government has been pondering car industry demands for a \u201cmarket stimulus\u201d, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/03/uk-car-industry-pushes-for-scrappage-scheme-to-help-buy-new-petrol-and-diesel-vehicles\" title=\"\">scrappage scheme</a>, that would not discriminate between diesel and electric vehicles.</p> <p>With the chill winds of an economic reckoning ahead, once the lockdown spring and summer is over, it could be tempting to simply boost demand and preserve any and all jobs. Right now, simply to restore a functioning economy and society might appear a sufficiently worthwhile and ambitious target for government. But the hard truth is that when the pandemic is over, the climate emergency will loom ever closer and larger \u2013 as even Boris Johnson acknowledged on Friday\u2019s World Environment Day.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1268843310162022402\" title=\"\">prime minister\u2019s tweets</a> had the scent of a Green New Deal, talking of a recovery that would help shape more resilient, relevant industries for the future. The world economy has now seen how its foundations can be rocked by a natural disaster \u2013 and, sooner or later, there will be another one. But few will now have faith that the government\u2019s actions will match its environmental rhetoric.</p> <p>So far, the only condition imposed on emergency funding appears to be demanding fare rises on Transport for London\u2019s public services. It would be perverse indeed now to refrain from the tough love of attaching environmental conditions to private firms. Any scrappage scheme that simply allowed the UK taxpayer to subsidise the purchase of more fossil-fuel cars, and did not attempt to significantly alter emissions and infrastructure, would be an appalling missed opportunity.</p>",
  "<p>In <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/04/the-martian-review-matt-damon-shines-stranded-astronaut\" title=\"\">The Martian</a></em>, the 2015 film directed by Ridley Scott, astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is accidentally abandoned alone on Mars by his crewmates after an emergency evacuation, without enough food to survive. Mars is a tricky prospect for even the most red- fingered gardener: there\u2019s almost no air, the \u201csoil\u201d has few nutrients and lots of heavy metals, and the temperature is typically around -60C. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to science the shit out of this,\u201d Watney, a botanist, declares. He decides to grow potatoes, jerry-rigging a climate-controlled dome, burning hydrazine to make water and creating a growth medium from Mars dust supplemented by his crewmates\u2019 faeces.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In Star Trek they just replicate food out of pure energy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One might expect proper scientists who are actually trying to work out how to grow food on Mars, with a view to supporting human life there at some point in the not-so-distant future, to be sniffy about such far-fetched speculation. \u201c<em>The Martian</em>? That\u2019s my favourite movie!\u201d exclaims Dr Wieger Wamelink, a senior ecologist at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, who has been conducting experiments on cultivating plants in space since 2013. \u201cIt\u2019s the only sci-fi movie where growing food is very important.\u201d</p> <p>When Wamelink started his experiments, many people thought his work was left-field and then some. Now, thanks to <em>The Martian</em>, originally a 2011 novel by the American writer Andy Weir, at least they understood what he was trying to achieve. \u201cThe movie helped tremendously,\u201d Wamelink says. It also, counterintuitively, supplied hypotheses he can test. \u201cThe journey to Mars takes half a year,\u201d he tells me on a video call from his garage in Wageningen, an attractive town on the Rhine, not far from Arnhem. \u201cSo store all your poo and pee. That\u2019s your starter kit, what you need to get started in the soil. Actually, <em>The Martian</em> is totally correct there. It may be smelly, but it\u2019s so important.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3c3c31e41baca433bd86dcb4e107b0af6f946ff5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c3c31e41baca433bd86dcb4e107b0af6f946ff5/1422_918_7683_9604/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018When I started the general idea was: \u201cFood?

Yeah, you just bring it along\u201d\u2019: gardening in space.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Phil Hackett/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 53-year-old Wamelink, who has a goofy sense of humour and, coincidentally, a passing resemblance to Matt Damon, has a background in plant breeding. Until recently, he had a conventional academic career at the university, which is world-renowned for its work on agriculture and forestry. However, Wamelink kept on being passed over for research grants: he was told once that his proposals were \u201cnot innovative enough\u201d.</p> <p>In the shower one day, Wamelink began to ponder the idea of food production in space. A fanatical Trekkie (\u201cbut I don\u2019t go to conventions and I don\u2019t wear costumes\u201d), he found that his immediate point of reference was sci-fi. \u201cIn <em>Star Trek</em>, it\u2019s easy: they just replicate food out of pure energy,\u201d says Wamelink. \u201cIf you look at <em>Deep Space Nine</em>, Commander Sisko likes to cook and he uses fresh vegetables. But they never show where they come from.\u201d Only in the original <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> series from the late 1970s, in which the fleet was followed by vast \u201cagro ships\u201d, was there a nod to the practicalities of life away from Earth.</p> <p>Wamelink drew up a new proposal: a theoretical study into growing plants on the Moon and on Mars. He was given \u20ac25,000. Wamelink then discovered that you could buy Nasa-endorsed \u201cregolith simulant\u201d, essentially soil from Earth that has many of the properties of that found in space: the \u201cmoon\u201d soil came from a desert in Arizona, and the Mars simulant from the side of a volcano on Hawaii, which is then cleaned and rolled to make it more dusty. Wamelink decided to make his experiments practical: what could he actually grow in these weird, nutrient-poor soils?</p> <p>In a greenhouse, Wamelink began with garden cress, which he planted on 1 April, 2013. \u201cNot a very handy day,\u201d he reflects now, \u201cbecause nobody believed us when we started it, especially journalists.\u201d Wamelink did not have especially high expectations. He was particularly concerned that lead, mercury and zinc in the soil would end up in the water that the plants absorbed and that they would then be toxic to eat.</p> <p>But, to Wamelink\u2019s surprise, the cress grew and, crucially, the plant did not take up the heavy metals. In the years since, Wamelink has refined the process. By adding organic matter (leaves and roots from the previous harvest) to the soil and earthworms to break it down, he has radically increased the size and quantity of the plants. He has also expanded the variety of crops: not just cress and salad leaves but tomatoes, peas, radishes and root vegetables such as carrots and potatoes. \u201cMars will come to fear my botany powers,\u201d Mark Watney predicts in <em>The Martian</em> \u2013 and Wamelink intends to make good on the promise.</p> <p>Moreover, Wamelink\u2019s research suddenly seems much less wacky. Against expectations, a 21st-century space race is under way, driven by national governments and hyper-wealthy private individuals such as Richard Branson and Elon Musk, who created his aerospace company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/spacex\" title=\"\">SpaceX</a> from a dream to grow a rose on Mars. Donald Trump wants US astronauts back on the Moon by 2024. The idea of establishing a base there, probably in advance of onward travel to Mars, is clearly on some minds. In January 2019, China\u2019s Chang\u2019e-4 probe became the first spacecraft from any nation to land on the Moon\u2019s far side. The mission took a few seeds, including cotton and potato. A cotton seedling even sprouted for a short period before dying in the harsh cold of the lunar night.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I started the experiment I was in contact with Nasa and other space agencies, but the general idea was: \u2018Food? Yeah, you just bring it along,\u2019\u201d recalls Wamelink. \u201cIt\u2019s boys and toys I always say, so rockets, satellites \u2013 things that cost lots of money that you can tinker on. It\u2019s those things they are working on. And well, that\u2019s changed.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>It\u2019s not exactly correct</strong> </em>to say that food in space has always been an afterthought. In 1979, Soviet cosmonauts aboard Soyuz 32 took eggs from Japanese quail: there were hopes that the fertilised eggs \u2013 a valuable source of lysozyme \u2013 could hatch in space and supplement the cosmonauts\u2019 diet with further eggs and meat. It was more complicated than they anticipated and it was not until 1990 that healthy quail chicks hatched (though they struggled especially with feeding in zero gravity and required tiny harnesses). Nasa tried similar experiments with chicken eggs in the 1980s. The Japanese have sent live fish to the International Space Station, and also looked into crop growth and edible insects. However, there\u2019s a new urgency to the research.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re on the space shuttle for just a week or two, of course, you\u2019re going to take everything with you,\u201d says Dr Gioia Massa, a plant scientist at Nasa\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. \u201cIt\u2019s like a camping trip, you\u2019re not going to do agriculture on short-duration trips. But we\u2019re finally getting to the point where we see going back to the Moon by 2024, we see going on to Mars in the future. These things that were really far out are now coming closer. And you can\u2019t just turn these things on overnight. You have to start testing in advance for when we go there.\u201d</p> <p>Massa works on <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/content/growing-plants-in-space\" title=\"\">N</a><a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/content/growing-plants-in-space\" title=\"\">asa\u2019s Vegetable Production System</a>, known informally as Veggie, which since 2014 has been cultivating plants in and for the International Space Station. The project has had success growing three types of lettuce, Chinese cabbage, red Russian kale, mizuna mustard and zinnia flowers in space. The astronauts are allowed to eat some of what they propagate (the rest comes back for testing), and it supplements their diet of 180 long-life foods, plus around 20 condiments and beverages that they consume on an eight-day cycle. In March, Massa published research that found space lettuce was not only safe to eat, but as nutritious as the crops the Veggie team was producing on Earth.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My husband actually teaches science fiction and fantasy at a local university</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Like Wamelink, Massa is a sci-fi fan. \u201cScience fiction had a huge impact on me \u2013 and still does,\u201d she says on the phone from Florida. \u201cMy husband actually teaches science fiction and fantasy at a local university in Orlando. So he\u2019s imagining things and I\u2019m trying to take those imaginings and make them real.\u201d</p> <p>The Veggie programme, though, differs from Wamelink on how best to grow the crops. Instead of using an approximation of the soil found on the Moon and Mars, Massa and her team have a system she calls \u201cmodified hydroponics\u201d: because of the complications of microgravity, the plants are grown in a solid substrate of baked, porous clay, which keeps water and oxygen around the roots. A time-release fertiliser supplies nutrients, light comes from LEDs and the astronauts add water.</p> <p>It\u2019s not a perfect set-up, Massa concedes. \u201cVeggie is a passive system, and it requires a lot of astronaut time to add water and guessing how much water to add,\u201d she says. \u201cSo we\u2019re walking this tightrope between a flood and a drought, and we fall off a lot.\u201d Still, for now, Massa believes that Veggie\u2019s modified hydroponics system has the most potential for supplying astronauts with fresh food in space that is certifiably safe to eat. For example, Martian soil is known to contain perchlorates, a toxic chemical (not present in the simulant soil used by Wamelink) that is poisonous to humans even in very small amounts.</p> <p>Both Massa and Wamelink agree that if we are to solve the problem of how to grow plants in space, we need to pursue multiple strands of investigation. And no ideas are too outlandish to rule out. Recently, Wamelink has been mulling over how you could get pollinators to Mars: he likes bumblebees (which could hibernate for the six-month journey) and flies, which could also be a source of protein if you are happy to eat the larvae. He\u2019s even been looking into human urine, purified, as a potential source of fertiliser. To get enough raw material to test, Wamelink approached festival organisers in the Netherlands.</p> <p>Wasn\u2019t he worried about the alcohol concentration? \u201cYes or even worse! It\u2019s in Amsterdam so\u2026\u201d he replies. \u201cBut they do some checks on it and there\u2019s no THC and all those things you get into pee if you smoke some dope. And that\u2019s important because you don\u2019t want to get the people over on Mars sick.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"079cfdc15f358c9f8265c0a4a7e151081f9b44f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/079cfdc15f358c9f8265c0a4a7e151081f9b44f8/0_204_2480_3100/800.jpg\" alt=\"Outside the box thinking: the tomatoes of tomorrow.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Outside the box thinking: the tomatoes of tomorrow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Phil Hackett/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em><strong>This all might seem</strong></em> a little esoteric for the regular gardener, but both Massa and Wamelink believe their work will also have an impact on Earth, even in our humble gardens and allotments. Massa points out that Nasa funded the research group that came up with LEDs for plant growth in the 1980s, a technology that is now widely used. The space agency has also invested in Florikan, a controlled-release fertiliser that could help reduce the environmental problem of fertiliser run-off in waterways and estuaries. \u201cThings like urban agriculture, vertical farming, factory farming, we share a lot of information between these groups,\u201d Massa says. \u201cWe learn from them, they learn from us.\u201d</p> <p>Covid-19 has slowed down some of the research, but not for long. Massa can go to the Kennedy Space Center for \u201cmission-essential work\u201d and the Veggie units on the space station continue unhindered.

According to German magazine <em>Der Spiegel</em>, police in the north-western city of Braunschweig received a tip about Br\u00fcckner in 2013 and sent it to the German Federal Office of Criminal Investigation, where it \u201cwas apparently not acted upon, much to the consternation of the local investigators\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"80a9dbe16e71ac3adf3649a9b63f89af601ac09e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80a9dbe16e71ac3adf3649a9b63f89af601ac09e/0_0_2684_3072/874.jpg\" alt=\"Christian Br\u00fcckner, Madeleine McCann suspect\" width=\"874\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christian Br\u00fcckner is now suspected of abducting three children.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Italian Carabinieri /AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fresh disagreements have also reportedly flared up between British detectives and&nbsp;Portuguese police, whose initial inquiry into Madeleine\u2019s disappearance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/oct/03/ukcrime.uknews4\">was roundly criticised</a>.</p> <p>Portuguese detectives had been accused of identifying the German paedophile as a suspect in 2007 but \u201cdiscarding\u201d him. Yesterday, Portuguese officers insisted they had forwarded his name to the British authorities in 2012 when they took on the case.&nbsp;</p> <p>Back in Germany, prosecutors are commencing fresh inquiries into how Ren\u00e9 disappeared without a trace from Aljezur on the Algarve on 21 June 1996. The resort is around 40 km from Praia da Luz, where Madeleine went missing 11 years later from her family\u2019s hotel room.&nbsp;</p> <p>Hasee was not with his son at the time. \u201cI\u2019d been on holiday with him the&nbsp;week before,\u201d he told&nbsp;the German newspaper. \u201cThen Ren\u00e9 went with his mother and her new partner to Portugal.\u201d</p> <p>The three had gone to a restaurant on&nbsp;the evening of his disappearance, after which they had wanted a walk on the beach. Ren\u00e9 went ahead, and removed his shirt and trousers because he wanted to go in the water. The adults lost sight of him and never saw him again.</p> <p>Hasee said he had long since got used to the fact that his son, who would now be 30, must have drowned, even if no evidence of that was&nbsp;ever found, and the wind and current conditions at the time meant it was unlikely. \u201cHe was actually a very careful child. He would not have simply gone into the Atlantic on his own,\u201d Hasee said.</p> <p>Ren\u00e9\u2019s disappearance was widely reported in Germany at the time but, unlike Madeleine\u2019s case, was soon forgotten about by the wider public. The parents\u2019 last contact with the police was&nbsp;around four years after Ren\u00e9;s disappearance.</p> <p>Now his hopes&nbsp;have been raised, Hasee said,&nbsp;that the truth about his son may finally emerge. \u201cOf course, it starts you thinking,\u201d Hasee said. Even if he is doubtful that his son might still be alive, he is desperate for clarity. \u201cUnfortunately, we don\u2019t even have a grave,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Elsewhere an investigator in Braunschweig, where Br\u00fcckner is last registered as having lived, has spoken of his frustration at trying to keep tabs on the German odd-jobs man, who has had a lengthy career as a child abuser, rapist and petty criminal.</p> <p>The investigator told the <em>Braunschweiger Zeitung</em> newspaper that he and his colleagues spent long periods following him around the city, believing him to be a \u201cdangerous sex offender\u201d who was a grave threat to the public.

But rioters left a five-mile long scar through southern Minneapolis as they burned and looted their way along one of the area\u2019s main shopping thoroughfares after ransacking the police station at the centre of the storm over Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>From there, a surge of anger radiated across the country, driven in good part by the nature of the nine-minute video of Floyd\u2019s killing, but also the frustration that for all the promises made with each police killing of an unarmed black man they do not stop.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0617b81f-5431-457d-b963-3e057fc1b578\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gfIWyPgE_E0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>When the traumatic video of Floyd begging for his life met the tinder of weeks of coronavirus lockdown, surging unemployment and a tanking economy the fire raced through America. It ignited protests and riots from New York to Los Angeles and the south, and then London, Berlin and beyond.</p> \n<p>Now, as 50 years ago, the national guard were called out to face down the demonstrators, although this time it was also to stand guard over the violent dispersal of a legal and peaceful protest to provide a photo op for Trump. Now, as then, the president accused \u201coutside agitators\u201d \u2013 Trump called them terrorists \u2013 of stirring up trouble.</p> \n<p>But this time, voices from the American establishment spoke up in support of those demands, and warned that the US is at an inflection point.</p> \n<p>So, apparently, was Trump\u2019s presidency, as he flailed while his tested tactic of divide-and-rule proved less effective. The power of the nearly nine minutes of Floyd\u2019s suffering as the police officer charged with his murder, Derek Chauvin, looked into the camera was taken as a statement of police contempt for African American lives and the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> \n<p>It was the moment when many of the doubters in America, the people always prepared to give the police the benefit of the doubt, were confronted with the indisputable evidence that police treat black people differently. If further evidence was required it came in the swirl of recordings of officers beating peaceful unarmed demonstrators that in some cities, including New York, drew accusations of a police riot.</p> \n<p>By the end of the week, the entire culture and practice of policing in America was on trial and not just over Floyd. But it was more than just policing.</p> \n<p>Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, where the protests began, described the uprising as a singular opportunity in his state\u2019s history to break the chain of \u201csystemic racism and the lack of accountability up and down our society that led to a daytime murder of a black man on a street in Minneapolis\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think this is probably our last shot as a state and a nation to fix this systemic issue,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b7eb9a5cff8de613c39db210ac178f039ef819bf\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7eb9a5cff8de613c39db210ac178f039ef819bf/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman in Washington on Friday holds a placard demanding justice for George Floyd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman in Washington on Friday holds a placard demanding justice for George Floyd.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Thayer/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Rev Al Sharpton, a central figure in America\u2019s civil rights movement, put it more succinctly in a rallying cry at the Minneapolis memorial service for Floyd on Thursday. White America, he said, needed \u201cto get off our neck\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe reason we could never be who we wanted and dreamed of being is you kept your knee on our neck,\u201d he cried to shouts of agreement. \u201cWe could do whatever anyone else could do. But we couldn\u2019t get your knee off our neck. What happened to Floyd happens every day in this country in education and health services and in every area of American life.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for us to stand up in George\u2019s name and say: get your knee off our necks.\u201d</p> \n<p>There were signs that the rest of America is ever more willing to hear that message than ever.</p> \n<p>Almost no one was willing to try to defend Chauvin\u2019s abuse of Floyd.</p> \n<p>Whereas construction workers turned on the anti-war protesters who marched through New York after the national guard shot demonstrators at Kent State University in 1970, this week \u201chard hats\u201d working in the city were seen clapping the demonstrators demanding justice.</p> \n<p>As the police teargassed and shot at people protesting legally from Portland to Kansas City, those on the receiving end included Americans not usually found marching to demand police accountability. Even some Republicans normally quick to defend the police were alarmed enough by the video of Floyd\u2019s death to turn out to march.</p> \n<p>In many places, the violent police response to legitimate protest only strengthened the sense that the problem lies deep in the culture of militarised police departments that act like occupation forces in minority communities.</p> \n<p>Yet there were also glimpses of progress. Police officers in other parts of the country \u2013 in Texas, Kentucky, Florida and other Trump states \u2013 went down on bended knee in a show of solidarity with the demands of demonstrators. Among them was the police chief of Ferguson, Missouri \u2013 the birthplace of the Black Lives Matters movement six years ago following riots and protests over the police killing of Michael Brown.</p> \n<p>The president instinctively lashed out over a crisis he couldn\u2019t control, with his tested attempts to create division and mayhem. But it proved to be the week when lines began to be drawn on the limits of Trump\u2019s power to subvert.</p> \n<p>The president has already neutralised the US justice department, freeing his allies from prison and compromising investigations. The supreme court is weighted in favour of his agenda, thanks to the highly politicised nomination process placing ideology over competenceunder a Republican-run Senate afraid of Trump.</p> \n<p>That left the military as the remaining branch of government over which his malign influence was not yet decisive.</p> \n<p>Then came what was quickly tagged the Battle of Lafayette Square, a small patch of park in front of the White House.</p> \n<p>A large and noisy group of protesters had gathered there to make known their support for demands that all of the police officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death be arrested. Ever sensitive to criticism, Trump was feeling humiliated by a report that he\u2019d bolted for a bunker under the White House a few days previously when demonstrators tried to climb its fence.</p> \n<p>Driven by his inner Putin, Trump decided to prove his courage by wading manfully into Lafayette Square to have his photo taken holding a Bible in front of a church. That would have the added benefit of playing to the evangelical vote.</p> \n<p>But first the peaceful protesters had to be cleared. Trump\u2019s attorney general, William Barr, ordered the police to empty the square, which they did with teargas and baton charges backed by soldiers of the national guard.</p> \n<p>Not long after, the sight of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Mark Milley, in combat fatigues marching behind the president as he strode across Lafayette Square seemed to give a stamp of approval to Trump\u2019s threat to turn out the military against those he was labelling domestic terrorists.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/nfl-decision-to-permit-kneeling-protest-by-players-enrages-donald-trump\">NFL decision to permit kneeling protest by players enrages Donald Trump</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The defence secretary, Mark Esper, had told state governors to \u201cdominate the battle space\u201d by which he meant up the use of force in their cities. The president\u2019s allies in Congress upped the ante, with Senator Tom Cotton proposing to send in the 82nd Airborne or \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d against those he called \u201cinsurrectionists\u201d. Trump, as ever on Twitter, gave that idea the thumbs up.</p> \n<p>Faced with this, America\u2019s military establishment chose a side.</p> \n<p>The first to break cover was James Mattis, the marine general who resigned as Trump\u2019s defence secretary in December 2018 and kept silent until now. He described himself \u201cangry and appalled\u201d at Trump\u2019s response to the protests and called him as a threat to the constitution.</p> \n<p>\u201cDonald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people \u2013 does not even pretend to try.

He accused Trump of disdain for the right of peaceful protest and said he was \u201cdeeply worried\u201d that the military will be co-opted for political purposes.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have to date been reticent to speak out on issues surrounding President Trump\u2019s leadership, but we are at an inflection point, and the events of the past few weeks have made it impossible to remain silent,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The head of the national guard, Gen Joseph Lengyel, felt it necessary to stake out a position just in case anyone thought he was siding with the president on the value of black lives. He said he was \u201csickened\u201d by Floyd\u2019s killing and \u201cenraged\u201d at the deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of \u201cpolice brutality and extrajudicial violence\u201d.</p> \n<p>Esper retreated. On Wednesday, he disavowed the idea of sending the military in to control the streets of America\u2019s cities. Not long after, the Pentagon began pulling out 1,600 troops moved to the Washington DC area during the protests. Few expect Esper to survive in his job for very much longer.</p> \n<p>But the real damage was inflicted on Trump. His chaotic handling of Covid-19, with deaths close to 110,000 and rising, had already damaged his diminishing prospects for re-election.</p> \n<p>The pandemic has also badly hit the one issue on which many Trump voters were prepared to forgive him all else: the economy. More than 20m jobs were lost in April. May saw 2.5m of those return, although unemployment for African Americans kept rising.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s response to the employment numbers on Friday was to describe it as a \u201cgreat day\u201d for Floyd.</p> \n<p>\u201cHopefully, George is looking down right now and saying, \u2018This is a great thing happening for our country. A great day for him, a great day for everybody,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>For his critics, the comment was another piece of the president\u2019s casual callousness mixed with self-obsession. But for all his boasts, Trump can no longer make claims for a booming economy, even if stock market growth did not translate into better standards of living for most Americans.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf 110,000 people have died and there\u2019s been no response, if we can move the national guard in a matter of hours but we can\u2019t keep people safe from a pandemic, it goes to show what the priorities are,\u201d said Annie Isler, a middle school teacher outside the Floyd\u2019s memorial in Minneapolis.</p> \n<p>Opinion polls put Joe Biden, now officially the Democratic nominee, ahead by 10 points or more.</p> \n<p>Confronted with this on Fox News, Trump said that four years ago the polls said Hillary Clinton was going to win and they were wrong. In any case, he has his own numbers.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have other polls where I\u2019m winning, and you\u2019ve seen them, too, I guess,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>No one else appeared to know where these polls were.</p> \n<p>As Minneapolis picked up the pieces, Al Sharpton led the memorial service for George Floyd. Alongside his demand for white America to \u201cget off our necks\u201d, and the heart rending glimpses into Floyd\u2019s life from his family, perhaps the most tortuous part for the mourners was when Sharpton asked them to stand in silence for eight minutes and 46 seconds to understand just how long Chauvin kept his knee pressing down on the African American man\u2019s neck.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"da96bd09b3befd5006cca61fc0b4895deeb7d5e1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da96bd09b3befd5006cca61fc0b4895deeb7d5e1/0_0_3500_2323/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Black Lives Matter mural in Washington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Black Lives Matter mural in Washington.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Barr\u00eda/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cAs you go through these long eight minutes, think about what George was going through, laying there for those eight minutes, begging for his own life.

Activists who have long fought to cut law enforcement budgets say they are seeing an unprecedented wave of support for their ideas, with some elected officials for the first time proposing budget reductions and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/minneapolis-public-school-end-police-contract\">divestments from police</a>. Here\u2019s what we know about the movement, and how cities and states are responding. </p> \n  <h2><strong>What does it mean to </strong><strong>\u2018defund the police\u2019</strong><strong>? </strong></h2> \n  <p>For years, community groups have advocated for defunding law enforcement \u2013 taking money away from police and prisons \u2013 and reinvesting those funds in services. The basic principle is that government budgets and \u201cpublic safety\u201d spending should prioritize housing, employment, community health, education and other vital programs, instead of police officers. Advocates argue that defunding is the best way forward since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/the-answer-to-police-violence-is-not-reform-its-defunding-heres-why\">attempts to reform police practices</a> over the last five years have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/us-police-officers-fired-rehired-why\">failed</a>, as evidenced by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/american-police-violence-against-black-people\">brutal killing of George Floyd</a>. Groups have a range of demands, with some seeking modest reductions and others viewing full defunding as a step toward abolishing contemporary police services. </p> \n  <h2><strong>How much does America currently spend on police? </strong></h2> \n  <p>In the past four decades, the cost of policing in the US has tripled and is now $115bn, according to a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-04/america-s-policing-budget-has-nearly-tripled-to-115-billion\">recent analysis</a>. That steady increase comes as crime has been consistently declining. In most cities, spending on police is <a href=\"https://populardemocracy.org/sites/default/files/Freedom%20To%20Thrive%2C%20Higher%20Res%20Version.pdf\">significantly greater</a> than spending on services and other departments ($1.8bn on police in Los Angeles, for example, which is <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-04/lapd-budget-cuts-garcetti-protests-explainer\">more than half</a> the city\u2019s general fund). The Covid-19 economic crisis has led cities and states to make drastic budget <a href=\"https://www.changethenypd.org/nycbudgetjustice\">cuts</a> to education, youth programs, arts and culture, parks, libraries, housing services and more.

It has never been. We can no longer use the flag to turn people away or distract them from the real issues that face our black communities. We did this back in 2017, and regretfully I brought it back with my comments this week. We must stop talking about the flag and shift our attention to the real issues of systemic racial injustice, economic oppression, police brutality, and judicial &amp; prison reform. We are at a critical juncture in our nation\u2019s history! If not now, then when? We as a white community need to listen and learn from the pain and suffering of our black communities. We must acknowledge the problems, identify the solutions, and then put this into action. The black community cannot do it alone. This will require all of us.</a></p> \n     <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/drewbrees/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Drew Brees</a> (@drewbrees) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-06-06T02:10:07+00:00\">Jun 5, 2020 at 7:10pm PDT</time></p>\n    </div>\n   </blockquote> \n   <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> \n  </figure> \n  <p>\u201cTo @realdonaldtrump.

  "<p>It\u2019s fascinating that in recent years the cultures of indoor and outdoor gardening have evolved along different lines, not just in terms of aesthetics, but in horticultural practice, too. As a new generation gets into gardening, inspired by recreating the indoor paradises on Instagram, many traditions of outdoor gardening are being bypassed \u2013 leading to a sort of parallel horticulture. This diversity is all part of the fun, but there are approaches one side can learn from the other \u2013 and two big tips indoor growers can pick up from outdoor ones.</p> <p>One of the biggest trends you see on social media is collections of dozens of plants all in individual pots, shot against the obligatory white industrial wall. I can only imagine this is because indoor plant collections tend to start with a cautious one or two specimens, and quickly spin out of control when the horticultural bug bites. But there are downsides to this. Small pots have a larger surface area to volume ratio, so they dry out far more quickly. This means loads more watering effort, and a far higher risk of plant failure. Then there\u2019s the nightmare of dusting and cleaning in the nooks and crannies between containers and, let\u2019s face it, the cost of all those individual pots can add up.</p> <p>Simply grouping plants into larger containers, such as windowboxes, means they will not only be easier to care for but will create naturalistic communities, like miniature garden borders all of their own. This creates a less cluttered look and will ultimately save you money as one or two big planters are generally cheaper than lots of small ones. Finally, if one of your collection does fail, in community plantings, other residents will quickly fill the space, so you will barely notice.</p> <p>The second thing is to not forget about flowers. I feel western outdoor garden design can be over-reliant on masses of floral colour for interest \u2013 to me it\u2019s the horticultural equivalent of chucking lots of salt and sugar into any recipe. But in the world of indoor gardening, there is such a strong trend for foliage at the moment that flowers are almost forgotten. Yet, even amidst a jungle of giant leaves and architectural forms, a few floral accents add complexity, drawing the eye and making the viewer pause to consider subtler details.</p> <p>I am currently in love with the Vietnamese violet <em>Chirita tamiana</em>. This is a more elegant and wild looking African violet that pops out never ending successions of white flowers with delicately painted violet throats. The smaller orchids, like paphiopedilums and dwarf phalaenopsis, will pop out a flower from an undergrowth of tropical leaves when you least expect it. The jewel orchids, such as macodes and ludisia are the best of both worlds. Their incredible leaves look like they are embroidered with gold thread, then every once in a while they will throw up a spike of tiny white blooms. Indoor gardeners shouldn\u2019t miss out on some outdoor joys. </p> <p><em>Follow James on Twitter&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Botanygeek?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@Botanygeek</a></em></p>",
  "<p>Last week, Britain became only the second country in the world whose official death toll from coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52925716\">exceeded</a> 40,000. The scale of the human tragedy is incomprehensible: at the pandemic\u2019s peak, almost 1,000 people were <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/uk/\">losing their lives</a> a day. They have left behind more than 40,000 families who are mourning at a time when they cannot come together to share their grief.</p> <p>This is a pandemic that has tested the public health response of governments in every corner of the world. But the UK has performed poorly on any measure: the death toll is now more than double what the government\u2019s scientific advisers said would be a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-passes-grim-milestone-of-20000\">good outcome</a>\u201d, and, at this point, it has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c53ab12-d859-4ceb-b262-f6a0221ca129\">one of the worst</a> excess deaths rates in the world.</p> <p>Yet the prime minister has offered no apology for the serious mistakes the government has made so far: its haphazard procurement of protective equipment for frontline workers; the tragedy it did too little to prevent unfolding in Britain\u2019s care homes; its unforgivably slow efforts to build up testing capacity. Last Wednesday, without a hint of contrition, he declared himself \u201cvery proud\u201d of the government\u2019s record on coronavirus, just the day before the chief operating officer of the NHS test-and-trace scheme told staff it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jun/04/nhs-track-and-trace-system-not-expected-to-be-operating-fully-until-september-coronavirus\">not be operating at full speed</a> for another three or four months. All along, there have been worrying signs that this was a government prepared to put politics above pandemic management; in the past two weeks, that sense has only intensified as Johnson has rushed in multiple lockdown relaxations in what looks like an attempt to distract from the rule-breaking of his top adviser. We cannot wait for a post-hoc public inquiry into what the government has got wrong.</p> <h2>Inadequate capacity to react</h2> <p>Just 10 years ago, Britain was considered to be a world leader in public health and pandemic management. Its public health rapid-response teams have been deployed to assist in emergencies around the world. But over the past decade, cuts in public spending have left local <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/blog/public-health-cuts\">public health teams depleted</a>, funding on interventions to cut smoking and obesity has been <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/research/publications/ending-the-blame-game\">reduced</a> and the tightest funding settlement in its 70-year history has left the NHS stretched beyond capacity.</p> <p>This hollowing-out of the state has left the UK far more vulnerable to the effects of a pandemic. In October 2016, the government ran a three-day simulation of an influenza pandemic. The conclusions were stark: Britain was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/revealed-the-secret-report-that-gave-ministers-warning-of-care-home-coronavirus-crisis\">not ready</a> for a pandemic. Comprehensive recommendations were made, from increasing stocks of protective equipment for frontline staff to expanding the capacity of care homes to deal with patients in such an event. It is clear from what has happened since that these recommendations were not adequately implemented.</p> <p>On top of that, the weeks of warning we had when the World Health Organization declared coronavirus a global health emergency <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/who-cited-human-transmission-risk-in-january-despite-trump-claims\">in late January</a> were wasted. By early March, several other countries had significantly invested in expanding their testing capacity; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/how-did-britain-get-its-response-to-coronavirus-so-wrong\">the UK had not</a>. This forced the government to choose a different strategy from that which the WHO was imploring countries to take \u2013 to \u201ctest, test, test\u201d. Instead, it announced it was abandoning efforts to control the spread of the virus through testing and tracing, with its scientific advisers going on the airwaves to suggest that by allowing some spread of the virus they expected the population to build up a natural level of herd immunity. Large sporting and cultural events that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/we-were-packed-like-sardines-evidence-grows-of-mass-event-dangers-early-in-pandemic\">brought together many thousands</a> of people from Britain and abroad, including from virus-stricken countries such as Spain, continued to go ahead in the first half of March, a decision that some scientists now believe will have certainly resulted in avoidable deaths. The official scientific advice that informed this decision betrays an over-reliance on simplistic assumptions about how people interact that could have been counteracted by having more frontline public health specialists at the table. And the UK left it until very late in the day by international standards to impose the level of lockdown needed to reduce the spread of the virus. Both the political decisions and the scientific advice that produced this late decision have rightly come under intense scrutiny.</p> <h2>Logistical errors</h2> <p>These early strategic mistakes have since been compounded by a series of logistical failures. At first, it looked as though the government\u2019s efforts to expand the capacity of the state to deal with coronavirus were going well - the rapid expansion of critical care capacity via the network of Nightingale hospitals was extraordinary - but other problems quickly emerged. In particular, a shambolic failure to ensure adequate supplies of protective equipment for health and care staff exposed serious weaknesses in the NHS\u2019s decentralised procurement structures; it has taken far too long for the government to get a grip on this, allowing the infection to have spread more quickly throughout hospitals and care homes. The government has also been far too slow to increase testing capacity, focusing on meeting arbitrary targets through any means necessary; it has been criticised by the chair of the UK Statistics Authority for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/statistics-watchdog-ministers-still-misleading-public-on-coronavirus-tests\">continuing to mislead the public</a> on the number of tests being carried out. And the intense focus on increasing the NHS capacity was not extended to care homes, where there have been <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-the-number-of-excess-deaths-in-care-homes-and-hospitals-compared-with-normal-times-is-revealed-11991080\">twice as many deaths as usual</a> for this time of year.</p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the government\u2019s failure to acknowledge, let alone address, these errors, a similar set of mistakes seems likely with respect to its test-and-trace scheme. The effective operation of this scheme, which would allow local government to track and limit the impact of local outbreaks, will be critical in minimising a second wave of deaths from the virus as lockdown restrictions are relaxed. It is the most complex delivery project of the pandemic yet. But the government was for weeks too reticent to involve local councils, which already have contact tracing and public health expertise, instead choosing to outsource huge parts of the scheme to large contractors, such as <a href=\"https://www.civilserviceworld.com/articles/news/serco-pay-%C2%A323m-after-serious-fraud-office-probe-moj-electronic-tagging-scandal\">Serco</a>, which have a poor track record of delivering government contracts. The emphasis has been on recruiting large numbers of poorly paid, inadequately trained call centre staff. It is extremely concerning that the scheme will not be fully operational until the autumn, given the lockdown relaxations that are already under way.</p> <h2>Political expediency</h2> <p>If the government has failed to learn from its logistical failures, the same can be said of its failures to incorporate a sufficiently wide range of scientific thinking and evidence into its decisions. The number of scientific experts who say that the government left it too late to impose a lockdown has only grown. One might reasonably have expected the government to broaden the range of expertise it relies upon in response.</p> <p>Instead, it appears to be ignoring any politically inconvenient science. Last week, it began to relax several areas of the lockdown simultaneously, with more to follow in a week\u2019s time. Many scientists, including several prominent scientists who sit on the government\u2019s scientific advisory committee, have warned that a more cautious approach is needed while there are still thousands of new infections a day, the estimated reproduction rate of the virus remains dangerously close to one and before a test-and-trace system is fully operational. The government\u2019s scientific advisory committee has estimated that a limited reopening of schools alone \u2013 just one of the measures introduced last Monday \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.tes.com/news/coronavirus-sage-half-class-rotas-safest-way-keep-r-down\">could increase the reproductive rate of the virus</a> by 0.2. Yet the government has pushed ahead, without setting out its calculation as to why these risks are warranted, in what appears to be an attempt to distract from the political row over the revelation that Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, broke lockdown rules at the height of the pandemic. Meanwhile, Johnson\u2019s failure to hold Cummings to account over his action sends a damaging message to the public that complying with the lockdown restrictions is optional.</p> <p>The events of the past week give further credence to the view that the government is putting populism before public health: the proposed introduction of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/03/the-tories-stumble-from-one-shambles-to-another-over-coronavirus\">a 14-day quarantine</a> for travellers coming into the UK appears to go against scientific advice and to have been motivated by the fact that Cummings believes it is regarded positively by the public. Similarly, the ridiculous scene of MPs queuing for more than a kilometre to physically cast their vote in parliament after the government ended virtual voting, even for those who are in the vulnerable category, suggests a government that is willing to ignore scientific advice when it goes against its own political interests.</p> <h2>Calls for public inquiry</h2> <p>All this points towards a depressing verdict. As the pandemic goes on, the government appears to be moving further away from, not closer to, the balance of scientific opinion; ministers are increasingly struggling with the huge logistical challenge of managing this pandemic, rather than learning from their mistakes; Johnson is approaching pandemic management more, not less, through the lens of the populist politics of the Vote Leave campaign that he and Cummings together led.</p> <p>We agree with the scientific and medical experts who wrote to the <em>Guardian</em> on Friday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/05/uk-experts-call-for-coronavirus-inquiry-to-prevent-deadly-second-wave\">calling for a rapid public inquiry</a>. Such an inquiry should be focused on producing practical recommendations for the autumn and could be conducted by a cross-party committee of senior parliamentary backbenchers. The government has so far proved too willing to take reckless risks with people\u2019s lives. It must be called to account for that sooner rather than later.</p>",
  "<p>History teaches that mass protests against oppression can lead either to liberation or brutal repression.</p> <p>This past week, Donald Trump bet his political future on repression.

This government has chosen lockdown as a deliberate strategy to avoid dealing with the political fallout from early release.</p> <p>Prisons are overcrowded and unhygienic. The secretary of state has publicly accepted that the prison population will need to be reduced and a substantial number of prisoners will need to be released in order to save lives in response to Covid-19.
