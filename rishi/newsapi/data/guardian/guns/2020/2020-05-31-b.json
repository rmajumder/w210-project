  "<p>Like us, our dogs should be eating the right foods for their bodies. Also like us, while they might enjoy eating hot chips for every meal, that\u2019s going to have a negative impact on their wellbeing.</p> <p>What dogs tell us they want is not always what they need. We shouldn\u2019t allow those puppy-dog eyes at the dinner table to sway our feeding decisions, but instead look at some key indicators more closely related to their health.</p> <h2><strong>Food is the same, but different, for our dogs</strong></h2> <p>Dr Lee Danks, a technical services veterinarian at <a href=\"https://blackhawkpetcare.com/au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Hawk</a>, says there are some common misconceptions when it comes to our understanding of the way our dogs eat. \u201cThe first is that food equals love,\u201d he says.</p> <p>We might imagine that sharing our meals with our dogs helps them feel happy and secure, but we often forget that it can send mixed messages when they can\u2019t distinguish this from their everyday meal of dog food, particularly when human foods are given irregularly, when the food is varied, and the precious resource of food is intertwined with another resource: social interaction. We often don\u2019t account for the extra calories too, and that can have long-term health implications.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bd91ed72bd85d4ef233e7b96ac3e413ca20bf7b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bd91ed72bd85d4ef233e7b96ac3e413ca20bf7b/0_0_5222_3606/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adding anything that isn\u2019t complete and balanced, such as table scraps, can throw your pet\u2019s diet out of whack.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"691\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adding anything that isn\u2019t complete and balanced, such as table scraps, can throw your pet\u2019s diet out of whack.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Paget/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Adding anything that isn\u2019t complete and balanced, such as table scraps, can throw your pet\u2019s diet out of whack. Photograph: Justin Paget/Getty Images.</p></li> </ul> <p>\u201cWhile meal sharing does build social bonds, just as it does when we have a lovely dinner party with our friends, it\u2019s also going to do them more harm than good if we\u2019re not completely aware of the impact,\u201d Danks says. \u201cGiven the opportunity, dogs will often overeat, and it\u2019s our responsibility to protect them from that.</p> <p>\u201cWe may think, my dog is following me about, therefore they want food, but this is a learned behaviour. Begging is something that we train into our animals.\u201d Understanding what they actually need is a different story.</p> <h2><strong>How do you know if your dog\u2019s diet needs an overhaul?</strong></h2> <p>\u201cAn early indicator is palatability,\u201d Danks says. In other words, how appealing the food is to the dog, including its taste and texture. There are a few reasons why your dog might suddenly go off their food.</p> <p>\u201cIt could be that their preferences have changed. Sometimes food is not being stored properly, which can change the food to lose some of its flavour.\u201d</p> <p>A few days without a meal can affect a dog\u2019s wellbeing, and they start to break down their own body tissue. If a fresh bag doesn\u2019t do the trick, it might be worth trying a new product.</p> <p>Other reasons might be revealed through a home health check. Danks says if body weight travels up or down , it can be a reminder to look at what they are eating, and how much they\u2019re getting. \u201cIf muscle drops away, we wonder if they are getting the amino acids and proteins, or ingredients like meat, that drive maintenance of lean muscle mass.\u201d</p> <p>Danks also says to watch out for something he calls \u201cpick-up-ability\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe sample you get every day while walking your dog is a poo,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can start asking ourselves, when we pick it up, does it leave a mark on the pavement? That tells you if there\u2019s a bit too much moisture in there. If you consistently have a puddle in one extreme or a dehydrated pebble on the other, then maybe what you\u2019re feeding should be changed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19653cad66278d08cf2378237a6c7916dfba4ccc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19653cad66278d08cf2378237a6c7916dfba4ccc/0_0_7952_5304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Your dog\u2019s poo can be a good indication of their health, and often the quality and suitability of their food.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Your dog\u2019s poo can be a good indication of their health, and often the quality and suitability of their food.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Petko Ninov/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Your dog\u2019s poo can be a good indication of their health, and often the quality and suitability of their food. Photograph: Petko Ninov/Getty Images.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>We should look to feed a high-quality, complete and balanced diet</strong></h2> <p>It might seem boring to us, but feeding one high-quality product will give your dogs all the food they need. That means all 37 essential nutrients are being provided with every meal, as long as you feed according to the guides on the packs.</p> <p>\u201cThe first challenge for the pet food manufacturer is that it is safe and balanced. And the second challenge is: does it taste good? If we\u2019re expecting dogs to enjoy it for years and years of their life, it needs to be something they want to go back to.\u201d</p> <p>Dogs eat according to a whole range of sensory experiences, starting with smell. For a kibble, Danks says, manufacturers such as Black Hawk coat the surface of the product with the natural ingredients that drive dogs to want to eat that food: usually fats and proteins. That mix gives the product a unique flavour profile, which creates aromas that are appealing to a dog\u2019s very sensitive nose, and makes them want to eat the nutritious food inside.</p> <p>\u201cThe vast majority of wet foods are also complete and balanced,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat you\u2019re looking for on the pack is an Association of American Feed Control Officials <a href=\"https://petfood.aafco.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">(AAFCO)</a> statement. If you\u2019re a conscientious manufacturer with a good formulation team behind you, you should be able to weave some magic and create a lovely combination of great ingredients to fulfil the AAFCO nutrient requirements. If you look on <a href=\"https://blackhawkpetcare.com/au/our-products\" rel=\"nofollow\">our packs</a>, you will see that statement.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>When you change your dog\u2019s diet, do it gradually</strong></h2> <p>If you do decide to shift your dog\u2019s diet to one that\u2019s more balanced or tailored, Danks says it\u2019s best to have a transition period.</p> <p>\u201cIf you eat bananas for the next five weeks, then suddenly shift to burgers, your gastrointestinal system is going to go haywire,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to cope.\u201d</p> <p>A rule of thumb is: if you\u2019re feeding a chicken-based diet, stick to a chicken-based diet. If you have a nutrition profile or ingredient list that\u2019s vastly different, that\u2019s where the transition process comes in. \u201cDay by day, increase the proportion of new versus old food to be gentle on their guts. That slow transition usually takes five to seven days, but can potentially take up to a couple of months for extremely sensitive individuals.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea5f76f324bf59be3060ce3502089e5f01bbc45e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea5f76f324bf59be3060ce3502089e5f01bbc45e/0_0_3864_2576/1000.jpg\" alt=\"It is wise to make any diet changes over 5-7 days to allow the digestive system to adjust to the new food\u2019s ingredients slowly.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It is wise to make any diet changes over 5-7 days to allow the digestive system to adjust to the new food\u2019s ingredients slowly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ghislain &amp; Marie David de Lossy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>It is wise to make any diet changes over 5-7 days to allow the digestive system to adjust to the new food\u2019s ingredients slowly.

The US is the worst-affected country in terms of cases and deaths, with 1,769,776 infections and 103,685 fatalities.</p> \n  <p><strong>\u2022 In a dramatic pivot, US president Donald Trump has postponed the Group of Seven summit that he wanted to hold in June.</strong> He will also expand the list of countries invited to attend the rescheduled event to include Australia, Russia, South Korea and India. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One during his return to Washington from Cape Canaveral in Florida, Trump said the G7 in its current format was a \u201cvery outdated group of countries.</p> \n  <p><strong>\u2022 British ministers have been accused of creating a \u201cfalse sense of security\u201d</strong> by launching a test and trace system that is not yet capable of controlling local outbreaks. A series of concerns have been raised over the gaps in the system launched last week, with local health chiefs warning that they have not been given the time, powers or data to prepare for outbreaks in their area. </p> \n  <p><strong>\u2022 Spain\u2019s prime minister has said he will ask parliament to agree to a last two-week extension of the state of emergency</strong> lockdown until 21st June, after which the government will no longer restrict citizens\u2019 movements, newspaper El Pais reported. Pedro Sanchez told regional government leaders that this would be the last lockdown as infection rates have reduced dramatically in one of the European countries worst hit by the pandemic.</p> \n  <p><strong>\u2022 Brazil registered a record 33,274 new cases of coronavirus on Saturday,</strong> its health ministry said, raising the total to 498,440 in a country with one of the world\u2019s worst outbreaks. The death toll in Brazil from Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, increased to 28,834, with 956 new deaths in the last 24 hours, the ministry said.</p> \n  <p><strong>\u2022 South Korea has reported 27 new cases of coronavirus, </strong>including 21 from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where officials have been scrambling to stem transmissions linked to club-goers and warehouse workers. The figures announced by South Korea\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday brought national totals to 11,468 cases and 270 deaths. Twelve of the new cases were linked to international arrivals.</p> \n  <p><strong>\u2022 Two of Islam\u2019s holiest sites have reopened as large numbers of mosques across Saudi Arabia also opened their doors </strong>for the first time in more than two months. Worshipers have been ordered to follow strict guidelines to prevent the spread of the coronavirus as Islam\u2019s holiest site in Mecca remained closed to the public. The Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, the third holiest site for Muslims after Saudi Arabia\u2019s Mecca and Medina, also reopened for prayers.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-31T10:34:11.232Z\">at 11.34am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed381ad8f08f5e373011bde\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/nina-lakhani\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-31T10:17:24.497Z\">11.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Food insecurity on the rise in the US</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/people-are-going-to-go-hungry-pandemic-effects-could-leave-54m-americans-without-food\">A record number of Americans face hunger this year</a> as the catastrophic economic fallout caused by the coronavirus pandemic looks set to leave tens of millions of people unable to buy enough food to feed their families.</p> \n  <p>Nationwide, the demand for aid at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/02/us-food-banks-coronavirus-demand-unemployment\">food banks and pantries has s</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/02/us-food-banks-coronavirus-demand-unemployment\">oared</a> since the virus forced the economy to be shutdown, resulting in more than 40m new unemployment benefit claims, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/28/us-job-losses-unemployment-coronavirus\">according to the latest figures.</a></p> \n  <p>As a result, an estimated one in four children, the equivalent of 18 million minors, could need food aid this year \u2013 a 63% increase compared to 2018.</p> \n  <p>Overall, about 54 million people across the US could go hungry without help from food banks, food stamps and other aid, according to an <a href=\"https://www.feedingamerica.org/sites/default/files/2020-05/Brief_Local%20Impact_5.19.2020.pdf\">analysis by Feeding America,</a> the national food bank network. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7cb9e7fdf154c950768e1a381e5cddd7eaf57995\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cb9e7fdf154c950768e1a381e5cddd7eaf57995/0_167_5004_3002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People wait in line to get care packages with food donations from the Food Bank for New York City in Brooklyn, New York, New York, USA, 15 May 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People wait in line to get care packages with food donations from the Food Bank for New York City in Brooklyn, New York, New York, USA, 15 May 2020.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alba Vigaray/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed37d538f087122eca52bdd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/patrickwintour\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-31T09:49:00.590Z\">10.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Donald Trump has been forced to cancel a planned face to face Summit of leaders of the <strong>G7</strong> nations in June and now wants to host an expanded meeting in September dedicated to combating China to which Vladimir Putin would be invited.</p> \n  <p>Trump revealed on Saturday he had cancelled the June G7 meeting after Angela Merkel the German chancellor told him in a phone call that she saw the summit in Washington as a health risk. Normally hundreds of journalists and officials attend the two day summits, as well as security staff. He had billed the face to face summit as a symbol of America \u201ctransitioning back to greatness\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Reports suggest the call between Merkel and Trump on Thursday was stormy ranging over German plans for Nord Stream gas pipeline, Hong Kong and the medical risks in holding a face to face G7.</p> \n  <p>Trump\u2019s new plan, outlined to reporters on Saturday, is to host an expanded meeting G7 including Russia, Australia, Korea and India dedicated to building an alliance against China. The plan is likely to be as controversial since Russia has been banned from western-led summits following Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014, and is not seen as a natural ally in the fight to defend human rights in Hong Kong.</p> \n  <p>Merkel and the French President Emmanuel Macron will also be reluctant to provide Trump with a prestigious platform, weeks ahead of the US Presidential election, to set out his China strategy. The Republicans see a tough approach to China as an election winning formula, even though his likely Democrat challenger Joe Biden is also sharply critical of the modern direction of China.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed37ac48f08f5e373011bbb\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-31T09:37:53.182Z\">10.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Spanish prime minister to seek two-week extension of state of emergency</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Spain\u2019s</strong> prime minister has said he will ask parliament to agree to a last two-week extension of the state of emergency lockdown until 21st June, after which the government will no longer restrict citizens\u2019 movements,<a href=\"https://elpais.com/espana/2020-05-31/sanchez-confirma-a-los-presidentes-autonomicos-que-pedira-una-ultima-prorroga-del-estado-de-alarma-hasta-el-21-de-junio.html\"> El Pais reported.</a></p> \n  <p>Pedro Sanchez told regional government leaders during a video-conference meeting on Sunday that this would be the last lockdown as Spain\u2019s infection rates have reduced dramatically.</p> \n  <p>The country\u2019s death toll rose by four on Saturday to 27,125, the health ministry said, reflecting a dramatic decline in daily fatalities as Spain brings the outbreak under control.</p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s footage, tweeted by prime minster\u2019s official residence, of that meeting earlier:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/desdelamoncloa/status/1267027087954784257\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"es\" dir=\"ltr\">El presidente del Gobierno se encuentra reunido mediante videoconferencia con los presidentes/as de las comunidades y ciudades aut\u00f3nomas.

He will also expand the list of countries invited to attend the rescheduled event to include Australia, Russia, South Korea and India. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One during his return to Washington from Cape Canaveral in Florida, Trump said the G7 in its current format was a \u201cvery outdated group of countries. I\u2019m postponing it because I don\u2019t feel that as a G7 it properly represents what\u2019s going on in the world.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>Key UK election battlegrounds face double hit. </strong>Key English election battlegrounds in the north-west and Midlands will be severely exposed to a double economic hit from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/31/key-election-battlegrounds-face-double-hit-from-brexit-and-coronavirus\">Brexit and coronavirus</a> should the UK fail to secure an EU trade deal by the end of the year, new analysis has warned. Boris Johnson has continued to rule out any extension to Britain\u2019s EU transition deal, which expires from January.

South Africa had already slipped into recession in the final quarter of 2019 before the virus arrived in March, and the rand has depreciated by 22.9% since January. Under eased restrictions, all but high-risk sectors of the economy will be allowed to reopen on Monday. The country reported 1,727 new cases, taking the cumulative total to 30,967.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil cases near 500,000. </strong>Brazil registered a record 33,274 new cases of the novel coronavirus on Saturday, its health ministry said, raising the total to 498,440 in a country with one of the world\u2019s worst outbreaks. The death toll in Brazil from Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, increased to 28,834, with 956 new deaths in the last 24 hours, the ministry said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Los Angeles shuts down Covid-19 testing amid protests. </strong>Coronavirus testing centres in Los Angeles, California have been closed due to safety concerns amid protests over the death of George Floyd, according to LA Mayor Eric Garcetti, who said the centres were being closed \u201cbecause of the safety worries across the city\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Korea reports 27 new cases. </strong>South Korea has reported 27 new cases of the coronavirus, including 21 from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where officials have been scrambling to stem transmissions linked to club-goers and warehouse workers. The figures announced by South Korea\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday brought national totals to 11,468 cases and 270 deaths. Twelve of the new cases were linked to international arrivals.</li> \n   <li><strong>Pope calls for world leaders to provide relief. </strong>Pope Francis implored world leaders to provide social and economic relief for the many workers who have lost jobs, and called for the enormous sums of money used to grow and perfect armaments be instead used to fund research to prevent similar catastrophes in the future.</li> \n   <li><strong>Cummings affair a danger to life, say experts. </strong>Britain\u2019s top public health leaders warned Boris Johnson that trust in the government has been shattered by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/dominic-cummings\">Dominic Cummings</a> affair and now poses real danger to life when lockdown measures are lifted this week. Cummings, Johnson\u2019s top aide, has been embroiled in a scandal after he was seen in Durham, 264 miles from his London home, despite having had coronavirus symptoms.

Furthermore, there was a cabinet meeting chaired by Johnson on 30 March, where it would be normal even if Cummings had not been present for a briefing to have taken place between the two. So would Cummings\u2019 absence not have been noted then by the PM, or other cabinet members?</p> <p>Cummings claims that he did not tell the PM until the week following his trip to Durham, when they were both in bed, and that they both don\u2019t remember the conversation.</p> <p>This begs the question of whether the story by Cummings can be squared with the account of Johnson\u2019s activities; and if the PM was not in a state to be able to remember things during this week, why did he post a video on 1 April saying he would soon be back, with his aides announcing that he would be out of isolation on 3 April?<br><strong>Mark Holman-Lisney</strong><br><em>Tadley, Hampshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 During last Monday afternoon\u2019s Covid-19 briefing, Boris Johnson added his support to Dominic Cummings\u2019 claim that the virus had impacted on his eyesight, necessitating the chief adviser\u2019s infamous 60-mile round trip to Barnard Castle. Brandishing a pair of spectacles from his top pocket, Johnson declared that yes, he too had experienced vision impairment \u201cassociated with coronavirus\u201d.</p> <p>I spent far too long last week watching footage of Johnson \u2013 glancing down at his notes at PMQs, glancing up at a clock as he emerged from No 10 to clap for carers, and scrutinising the faces on Zoom during his liaison committee appearance on Wednesday. I\u2019ve yet to see any evidence of the aforementioned spectacles being used.</p> <p>Would it be cynical of me to surmise that the spectacles were a convenient prop designed to pull the wool a little further over a nation\u2019s eyes?

  "<p>Senior public health officials have made a last-minute plea for ministers to scrap Monday\u2019s easing of the coronavirus lockdown in England, warning the country is unprepared to deal with any surge in infection and that public resolve to take steps to limit transmisson has been eroded.</p> <p>The Association of Directors of Public Health (ADPH) said new rules, including allowing groups of up to six people to meet outdoors and in private gardens, were \u201cnot supported by the science\u201d and that pictures of crowded beaches and beauty spots over the weekend showed \u201cthe public is not keeping to social distancing as it was\u201d.</p> <p>On Saturday and Sunday, parks and seafronts were packed as people anticipated the lifting of restrictions on what has been dubbed \u201chappy Monday\u201d. Car showrooms and outdoor markets will also be reopened, millions of children will return to primary schools and the most vulnerable \u201cshielded\u201d people will be allowed out for the first time since lockdown began in March, all as long as physical distancing is maintained.</p> <p>But Jeanelle de Gruchy, president of the ADPH, said her colleagues across England were \u201cincreasingly concerned that the government is misjudging the balance of risk between more social interaction and the risk of a resurgence of the virus, and is easing too many restrictions too quickly\u201d.</p> <p>They have called on ministers to postpone the easing of restrictions until more is known about the infection rate, the test-and-trace system is better established and public resolve to maintain physical distancing and hygiene can be reinforced.</p> <p>\u201cWe have not spoken out in this way before,\u201d De Gruchy said, \u201cbut we are concerned that if there is a spike it will be in our communities. We need to be confident we can get on top of it, and we are not confident yet.\u201d</p> <p>The beach at the Durdle Door beauty spot in Dorset remained closed on Sunday after people crowded there on Saturday and air ambulances were forced to land on the sand after three people were injured while jumping off the rocks. Wildfires also broke out across the north of England as firefighters blamed the easing of lockdown for the number of people having illegal barbecues on the moors. In Derbyshire, police towed cars blocking lanes near a notoriously toxic lake which they dyed black in order to deter swimmers earlier in the lockdown. Hoffman Quarry and the surrounding area was \u201clike Skegness in peak summer\u201d, said the local police.</p> <p>Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, admitted that \u201croom for manoeuvre [in lifting the lockdown] is quite limited\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>He said the government was \u201creasonably confident\u201d the lifting of restrictions was manageable. Earlier, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, described it as \u201ca delicate and dangerous moment\u201d. He said if infections surged, the government could impose geographically targeted measures such as locking down specific cities.&nbsp;</p> <p>Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer for England, also stressed the rate of the rise in the death toll, which climbed by 113 to 38,489 on Sunday was only falling \u201cvery gently\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>She said the public \u201creally, really need to stick to the message\u201d and said: \u201cAs we move forward with the easing of our lockdown restrictions we encourage people to maintain all focus on maintaining social distancing.\u201d</p> <p>The public health directors, who work for local authorities, said they had realised in recent days that the government\u2019s test-and-trace system was not yet robust enough to quash any resurgence in the virus and warned that the R infection number \u2013 estimated at between 0.7 and 0.9 \u2013 was too close to 1, above which the infection is growing.&nbsp;</p> <p>They also said that the lockdown must remain in place until \u201crelentless efforts are made to regain and rebuild public confidence and trust following recent events\u201d, an apparent reference to the Dominic Cummings affair.</p> <p>In Scotland, which is exiting lockdown more slowly, the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, warned of a significant risk coronavirus could \u201crun out of control again\u201d. Prof Devi Sridhar of Edinburgh University, a member of the Scottish government\u2019s Covid-19 advisory group, said she feared a rise in coronavirus numbers in England was inevitable.</p> <p>\u201cThe only thing that might save England is the good weather, and the warmth if this virus does indeed die outside quite quickly,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it is incredibly worrying, because the numbers are not low enough to have a testing and tracing system take over.\u201d</p> <p>Nurses also called for caution. Dame Donna Kinnair, the chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said staff were \u201canxious that easing lockdown could undo the progress we\u2019ve made as a country in combatting this virus\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cPeople must continue to act sensibly and think of the nurses they\u2019ve applauded before they do anything that could jeopardise their health and the health of others,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Sally Bloomfield, an honorary professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, also warned \u201cour desire to socialise means that the critical nature of our situation is being forgotten\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhy introduce all of these measures at the same time \u2013 which means that if the situation deteriorates it will be impossible to know which measures need to be reimposed, and we will just have to go back to lockdown?\u201d she said. \u201cThis does not look like gently lifting the lid. In reality, the option to meet with non-household members in private gardens is only a small extension of meeting in public parks, but my fear is that it is not being seen this way.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>University leaders have reacted angrily to the UK government\u2019s plan to control the number of students from England who can study in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, saying that it was punishing them for problems caused by the coronavirus outbreak in England.</p> <p>The Department for Education in England is expected to confirm a cap on the number of undergraduates each university can recruit this autumn \u2013 limiting institutions to an increase of no more than 6.5% in the number of new students \u2013 in a bid to stop institutions poaching students from their rivals.</p> <p>But universities and ministers in the devolved administrations said they have been shocked to learn that the DfE wants to impose the same limits on Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, despite higher education policy being devolved to individual governments.</p> <p>Sally Mapstone, the vice-chancellor of the University of St Andrews, said: \u201cThere\u2019s been no consultation about this with Scottish universities at all.

We were not in that group, so to effectively penalise us for something that stems in part from behaviour south of the border seems inappropriate.\u201d</p> <p>Close to 18,000 students from England travel to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland each year to start undergraduate degrees. Welsh universities are particularly popular with English students, with Cardiff University admitting nearly 60% of its undergraduates from across the border.</p> <p>Colin Riordan, the vice-chancellor of Cardiff University, said: \u201cIf there is any intention to limit the numbers of English students that can study in Wales, that would be a real problem and it just does not make any sense.\u201d</p> <p>Riordan said Cardiff and other universities have already sent out offers to their applicants and many would have already accepted university places.</p> <p>\u201cThat puts us in a contractual position with them, so I don\u2019t know how that would pan out. What I\u2019m hoping is that this is some sort of mix-up that hasn\u2019t been thought through, or it\u2019s some sort of mistake that can be resolved,\u201d Riordan said.</p> <p>Michelle Donelan, the universities minister for England, is to hold a further meeting with her counterparts on Monday, with further details to be announced next week, according to the DfE.</p> <p>Anton Muscatell, the vice-chancellor of the University of Glasgow, said: \u201cIf an agreement is reached between the governments, it is important that Scottish institutions are treated fairly, on similar terms to English institutions.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/21/universities-brink-crisis-coronavirus-pandemic-tuition-fees\">Universities are on the brink of crisis.

  "<p>For the best part of two turbulent decades, the 1970s and 80s, my friend and rival Michael Green was scarcely off British television screens as industrial correspondent of Independent Television News. It was a period that encompassed two climactic miners\u2019 strikes, the winter of discontent, and the advent of Thatcherism. Industrial news was so intertwined with politics that industrial reporters were on the air as much as political correspondents.</p> <p>Michael, who has died aged 76 of a rare lung disease, managed it all with an even-handed fair-mindedness that contrasted with the political baggage encumbering some of his contemporaries. His willingness to listen and his palpable honesty brought him the respect and necessary confidences of industry leaders who were often suspicious and reluctant to level with the media.</p> <p>A handsome, gregarious man, he was liked and respected at ITN as well as among the rumbustious industrial correspondents\u2019 group, where his ability to drink a pint straight down did him no harm. His former editor, Sir David Nicholas, credited him with \u201ca vital part in building up ITN\u2019s reputation\u201d. He was notorious for the last-minute timing of his copy but got away with it because \u201che was such a gentleman\u201d; the word most frequently employed in many tributes on social media. As one close colleague said, \u201cHe deferred to none and listened to all. There wasn\u2019t an ounce of vanity in his body \u2013 which is odd for our industry.\u201d</p> <p>Sir Brendan Barber, a former TUC general secretary, said: \u201cHe handled everyone with a mixture of charm and good humour. If you saw him coming, you would look forward to the encounter with some enthusiasm.\u201d</p> <p>Michael\u2019s career followed a traditional journalistic route. Born in York, the son of John, a music teacher, and Enid (nee Hutchinson), he left school in Taunton at 17 to become a reporter on regional newspapers. He was hired by the Daily Mail when industrial correspondent for the Bristol Evening Post and then joined the Daily Telegraph. ITN came calling in 1973. In 1990 he was headhunted to become director of public relations at British Coal, leaving at privatisation for Vivendi, a French conglomerate. In 2002 he set up Green Fox Communications.</p> <p>In 1967 he married Judy Law. They had met as teenagers and their strong bond was obvious. Judy kept horses at their home in Hampshire and Michael was known to muck out before leaving for work. They subsequently moved to Cockwood, in Devon, on the river Exe where Michael indulged his love of sailing and became commodore of the local sailing club. His extensive pro bono activities included working with prisoners via the Independent Monitoring Boards.</p> <p>A physically active man, he regularly put himself to the test, usually for charity, running the London marathon and taking part in the Three Peaks challenge which involved both sailing and mountain-climbing.</p> <p>He is survived by Judy, their three children, Oliver, Xanthe and Freddie, and six grandchildren, Rocket, Lily, Michael, Solomon, Jago and Pandora.</p>",

In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>\n    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>\n    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>\n    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.</p>\n    <p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far.

By rapidly expanding our testing capacity, we have been able to introduce NHS test and trace, and enabling those who have coronavirus symptoms to get a test is an important part of the programme.\u201d</p> \n<p>Prof John Newton, the national testing coordinator, said: \u201cThe expansion of our testing capacity has allowed us to take important steps to control the virus, including the introduction of a world-class contact tracing service that will help us to safely ease lockdown over time.

The antibody tests will help to build a picture of how many healthcare workers have been infected with Covid-19 and could be used to get more accurate figures on the proportion who showed symptoms. It is not yet clear, however, that having antibodies guarantees immunity. Some also questioned the value of the huge push for testing over the weekend.</p> \n<p>The Health Service Journal reported that NHS pathology labs were given just two days to roll out thousands of antibody tests as part of the push to reach a 40,000 capacity target.

  "<p>Privacy campaigners are preparing a legal challenge to the NHS\u2019s coronavirus test-and-trace programme as concerns grow about the amount of contact data that will be collected and retained by government.</p> <p>The Open Rights Group (ORG) has instructed the data rights lawyer Ravi Naik to draft a letter outlining its concerns after Public Heath England said it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/nhs-will-keep-personal-data-of-people-with-coronavirus-for-20-years--uk-test-and-trace-programme\">retain \u201cpersonally identifiable\u201d data of those who test positive for 20 years</a>.</p> <p>Jim Killock, the ORG\u2019s executive director, said: \u201cThe government needs to better explain its reasoning; what they have done so far has been rushed.

Public opinion is very volatile about this sort of thing. One minute everyone can be seeing the absolute good sense, and the next they can have a lot of worries about it.\u201d</p> <p>Harman said the 20-year limit risked losing the trust of the public, and giving authorities too much leeway. \u201cOur goal is to make the promises that [Hancock] has already made meaningful. Assurances in a letter don\u2019t protect anyone. What protects people is legislation,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d rather they just did the bill, because I don\u2019t want to be turning around and saying \u2018I told you so\u2019 when there\u2019s some sort of scare and confidence collapses and the important test-trace-isolate initiative hits a roadblock.\u201d</p> <p>The JCHR, a cross-party committee that includes members from both houses of parliament, took the unusual step of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/15/mps-and-peers-call-for-legal-requirement-to-delete-uk-contract-tracing-data\">drafting its own bill</a> enshrining in law the requirement to delete gathered information after the end of the outbreak. \u201cThis is what Boris Johnson would describe as oven-ready,\u201d said Harman. \u201cI just think they\u2019re being irrational about it, and unwise, and are going to make things more difficult.\u201d</p> <p>In the letter to Hancock, Harman lays out 10 areas where existing law does not match the promises the government has made, from security to anonymisation.</p> <p>PHE said it was standard practice across the NHS to securely retain data for the benefit of both patients and wider public health, and that all data collection and storage is fully compliant with <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation\">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018.</p> <p>Separately, a rightwing thinktank has said an independent reviewer would bee needed to review coronavirus emergency powers and surveillance measures if they look like becoming permanent.</p> <p>A report from the Henry Jackson Society concluded that \u201ccontinued scrutiny\u201d of the powers under the Coronavirus Act was vital and should reflect the system of oversight used for terrorism legislation.</p> <p>Existing rules provide for an independent reviewer of terrorism legislation \u2013 Jonathan Hall QC \u2013 who scrutinises and reports on security bills and has access to sensitive and secret information to carry out their job.</p> <p>Nikita Malik, the author of the Leaving Lockdown report, said that the government\u2019s response to Covid-19 had involved \u201cnavigating the balance between civil liberties and national security\u201d and that \u201cwhat was needed now was greater transparency, oversight, and accountability.</p> <p>Malik also highlighted attempts to consolidate NHS databases in work being conducted to help ministers respond to the pandemic by the data mining firms Palantir and Faculty, the second of which worked on the Vote Leave campaign in 2016. The report said there were \u201cconcerns around \u2018surveillance creep\u2019 where intrusive powers are expanded or data is used to prosecute for a range of crimes\u201d.</p>",

</p> \n   <p>The perception for many will be that it is safe, but this can also apply considerable emotional pressure to those most vulnerable to either comply, or to repeatedly have to justify why they might not feel comfortable now seeing loved ones or leaving the relative safety of their homes. </p> \n   <p>Furthermore, should measures be further relaxed, shielders may experience difficulties relating to the workplace or childcare that were previously covered by simple criteria. </p> \n   <p>It is imperative that the sacrifices made during lockdown are not undone by relaxing measures in haste. </p> \n   <p>Clear guidelines in terms of why risks are now different are essential to provide the UK population with the tools to decide for themselves when it is safe.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed3792b8f08f5e373011bb3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-31T09:31:58.806Z\">10.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Coronavirus test and trace system \u2018creating false sense of security\u2019</h2> \n  <p>Ministers have been accused of creating a \u201cfalse sense of security\u201d by launching a test and trace system that is not yet capable of controlling local outbreaks.</p> \n  <p>A series of concerns have been raised over the gaps in the system launched last week, with local health chiefs warning that they have not been given the time, powers or data to prepare for outbreaks in their area.

A successful splashdown sometime this summer will pave the way for regular operational missions as early as August.&nbsp;</p> <p>In a long-held tradition, the astronauts got to choose a name for their spaceship, and announced several hours after their spectacular lift-off from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral they were honoring a shuttle orbiter they both flew aboard.</p> <p>\u201cWithout further ado, we would like to welcome you aboard capsule Endeavour,\u201d Hurley said.</p> <p>\u201cWe chose Endeavour for a few reasons, because of this incredible endeavour Nasa, SpaceX and the United States have been on since the end of the shuttle program back in 2011.</p> <p>\u201cThe other reason is a little more personal to Bob and I. We both had our first flights on shuttle Endeavour, and it just meant so much for us to carry on that name.\u201d</p> <p>Nasa\u2019s flight managers in Houston had welcoming words for the crew after assuming control of Behnken and Hurley\u2019s mission following Endeavour\u2019s docking.</p> <p>\u201cFor the first time since the retirement of the space shuttle, you have completed a historic ride to the ISS and have opened up a new chapter in human space exploration,\u201d&nbsp;Joshua Kutryk, a space station mission controller declared.</p> <p>\u201cTo our SpaceX colleagues, bravo on a magnificent moment in spaceflight history and on the start of a new journey that has changed the face of space travel in this new era of space transportation.\u201d</p> <p>Saturday\u2019s groundbreaking launch, which took place at 3.22pm ET after being delayed by poor weather from Wednesday, lit the skies over Cape Canaveral as the Falcon 9 rocket blazed a trail across the Atlantic ocean on a 12-minute journey to orbit. The capsule could be seen in the skies above the UK, chasing down the ISS.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been way too long,\u201d Jim Bridenstine, the Nasa administrator, said of the launch. \u201cIt was just an amazing day. I\u2019m breathing a sigh of relief but I won\u2019t be celebrating until Bob and Doug are home safely.\u201d</p> <p>Musk, the founder of PayPal and the electric car manufacturer Tesla, was emotional at a press conference following the launch, which was attended by Donald Trump and Mike Pence, the US vice-president.</p> <p>\u201cIt is the culmination of an incredible amount of work by the SpaceX team, by Nasa, and by a number of other partners,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can look at this as the results of a hundred thousand people roughly when you add up all the suppliers and everyone working incredibly hard to make this day happen.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>My friend Peter Rushton, who has died aged 68 of a heart attack, joined Sunderland Polytechnic (now Sunderland University) in 1979 after working for a short while at Wrexham Glynd\u0175r University (formerly North East Wales Institute of Higher Education). He remained at Sunderland for the rest of his life, becoming professor of historical sociology in 2009.</p> <p>Peter was born and brought up in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, the son of Stanley Rushton, a lecturer in statistics, who died when Peter was five years old, and Marjorie (nee Champion), a hospital social worker. His mother had a passion for historical buildings, churches, and historical sites and most holidays included visits to these. Peter inherited her enthusiasm.</p> <p>His interests were wide ranging and his knowledge extensive. Having gained a first-class degree in archaeology and anthropology at Cambridge, Peter completed an MA in sociology at Manchester University, followed by a PhD on early modern witchcraft.</p> <p>His first teaching subjects \u2013 criminology and sociology \u2013 remained within a repertoire that expanded to include advanced social theories, gender and family studies, punishment and society and, at postgraduate level, law and early modern society. He supervised numerous PhD candidates, and generations of students valued his erudition.</p> <p>During the 1980s Peter initiated a pioneering part-time MA in historical studies that led to a lasting research partnership with Gwenda Morgan. They had great enthusiasm for uncovering secrets hidden in archives and together became authorities on early modern criminal transportation. Only a week before his death Peter completed proofreading their final book, Treason and Rebellion in the British Atlantic, 1685-1800.</p> <p>His other publications and conference papers represented his diverse research interests, including mental health, gender, sexuality, law, the history of Sunderland, and contemporary politics. In 2018, he co-edited, with Catherine Donovan, Austerity Politics: Bad Ideas in Practice.</p> <p>A committed trade unionist, Peter never aspired to managerial positions. He had a strong sense of justice, arguing consistently against unfairness and willingly gave his time to act as a critical friend to colleagues across the university sector.</p> <p>Peter influenced many people, many of whom benefited from his kindness. He enjoyed spending time with a small circle of close friends, who appreciated his conversation. He was keen on travelling and walking and was an excellent photographer.</p> <p>He is survived by his sister, Lesley, and two nephews.</p>",
  "<p>Some parents are calling for a Scotland-wide virtual school as anxieties grow at the prospect of indefinite home schooling into the autumn and beyond.</p> <p>While pupils transitioning into primary and secondary schools should be in class briefly before the summer holidays begin at the end of June, the majority of Scotland\u2019s schoolchildren with not return until 11 August, and then to a blended model of in-school and at-home learning.</p> <p>With parents already struggling to support their children\u2019s education, often while continuing to work from home, there was consternation when it emerged last week that Scotland\u2019s largest local authority, Glasgow city council, is considering a model that would see children in school only two days out of every five.</p> <p>Jenifer Johnston, public affairs expert and mother of two, was deluged with responses from overwhelmed parents when she <a href=\"https://reformscotland.com/2020/05/scotland-needs-a-virtual-school-jenifer-johnston/\">proposed the idea of a virtual school</a> for the Reform Scotland thinktank.</p> <p>\u201cParents are currently using up holiday, flexitime, unpaid leave and their employers\u2019 good will with no idea when this might end,\u201d she said. It\u2019s particularly tough for single parents and those in precarious employment.\u201d</p> <p>Johnston credited the efforts of individual teachers, schools and councils in her proposal, but described the current localised approach as unsustainable, with parents expected to use a huge variety of teaching methods \u2013&nbsp;Microsoft Teams,&nbsp;SeeSaw,&nbsp;Zoom, Show My Homework, Google Classroom, Google Hangouts,&nbsp;emails and&nbsp;printables \u2013 while struggling with the functionality of Glow, the national school intranet.</p> <p>\u201cMy ask of the Scottish government is that there is a national online curriculum developed and delivered digitally in really simple, open-access websites, no passwords, no gatekeeping, just lessons broadcast daily on a website, join in if you can,\u201d Johnston wrote in her article for Reform Scotland. \u201cLessons could be live and recorded to watch later if children can\u2019t get to them right away.\u201d</p> <p>Eileen Prior, executive director of Connect, Scotland\u2019s national parents\u2019 organisation, said that the stresses of overseeing schoolwork are now magnified by worries about a part-time system from August. \u201cParents often feel ill-informed about what the expectation is, or simply feel they don\u2019t have the skills or knowledge to support. Lack of access to devices or poor connectivity has been mentioned many times.\u201d</p> <p>Prior argued that there is now an opportunity to adopt a strategic national approach \u201cwhere the most skilled and creative develop online materials, and class teachers provide support to their pupils in ways that are immediate and personal\u201d.</p> <p>Vonnie Sandlan, a mother of four, three of whom are of school age, admitted she was shocked when she read a draft of the Glasgow city council proposals, which the council insists remain under consideration.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/10/scotland-eyes-outdoor-learning-as-model-for-reopening-of-schools\">Scotland eyes outdoor learning as model for reopening of schools</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSeeing a two-day week in black and white was a reality-check.

The current season may run over, and that could impact on signing players, so we have to consider our options about 2021.\u201d</p> <p>Some in the sport\u2019s heartlands, where there remains scepticism over expansion, feel this should be the ideal opportunity for league to focus on its existing clubs, rather than new opportunities overseas. \u201cThat\u2019s got to be one of the most idiotic statements ever made,\u201d says Eric Perez, the CEO of Ottawa Aces and the founder of Toronto Wolfpack. \u201cRugby league has to take itself into new places and new territories. If it doesn\u2019t do that, the sport will die.\u201d<br>Perez insists Ottawa will be ready for 2021, but with next season certain to be delayed, plus Catalans and Toronto effectively becoming de facto English sides for the remainder of this year, those who believe expansion is the key to rugby league\u2019s survival face a nervous wait over the coming months to see how things unfold.<br></p>",
  "<p>Tributes have been paid after the death of Michael Angelis, an actor who will be remembered as the morose rabbit-obsessed Lucien from The Liver Birds, the desperate Chrissie in Boys from the Blackstuff, and the narrator of Thomas the Tank Engine.</p> <p>Angelis died suddenly while at home with his wife on Saturday, his agent said.

  "<p>I wandered like a zombie into a social media argument about Kellyanne Conway, adviser to Donald Trump. I think I was looking for some outrage in public discourse I knew nothing about, to take my mind off the outrages I knew too much about. \u201cPeople will wait in line for an hour for a Georgetown cupcake,\u201d she said, \u201cso I think they can probably wait in line to do something as consequential as \u2026 cast their ballot.\u201d Her case didn\u2019t look especially strong \u2013 taking the most indulgent and absurd thing that the time-rich, regular-rich person might sometimes do, and trying to extrapolate a voting system from it.&nbsp;</p> <p>But I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes on the bigger picture; all I could think about was the queueing. This is our life now. When I dream about chance encounters with lost friends, they happen outside the Co-op. On the great scroll of things we\u2019re not really allowed to complain about, queueing is at the top. It\u2019s a trivial inconvenience, in the grand scheme of the disaster. And it\u2019s part of our national story, the one thing we are still supposed to be good at, after \u201csound governance\u201d and \u201cstiff upper lips\u201d didn\u2019t pan out so well.&nbsp;</p> <p>So OK, deport me: I hate it. It was worse at the start of physical distancing, when all the unknowability of the outside world seemed to distill into these completely random shopping experiences: would it be an hour? Would it be five minutes? Would you ever move again? I stood for 20 minutes in the underground car park of a Waitrose, watching a queue that was so still it was like an oil painting by an artist who (for a lot of totes legitimate and understandable reasons) vehemently hated the middle classes. I got so close,&nbsp;<em>so close</em>, to the inside of a butcher\u2019s, when the person ahead of me decided he would like one of each animal, whole, boned and rolled, and also he would like to learn how to tie a butcher\u2019s knot. I waited outside a Tesco, where we were patrolled by an attendant to check we were standing far enough apart. I felt like he should go full sergeant major and try to get us to stand up straight while he was at it. \u201cJust leave the guy alone,\u201d said Mr Z.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything to him! I\u2019m just thinking things about small amounts of power and what they do to a person.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cYou know, of everything anyone has ever thought, that is the most obvious.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>What were we doing in a queue together? That\u2019s crazy. That is like making your spouse take a blood test or a speed-awareness course, just because you have to. I can\u2019t remember. I always thought he loathed the enterprise even more than I did, but then he said he didn\u2019t hate queueing, he only hated it with me, because he found the air of delinquent restiveness very stressful. \u201c<em>My&nbsp;</em>delinquent restiveness?\u201d I said, astonished, because, from where I was standing \u2013 squarely on my line of black and yellow tape \u2013 if anyone was going to rush the doors screaming, \u201cI am not a number, I am a free man\u201d (or its lockdown variant, <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/tiny-crowd-shows-up-anti-22037507\">\u201cI am a free I am not MAN a NUMBER\u201d</a>), it would definitely be him.&nbsp;</p> <p>I got into an argument outside Sainsbury\u2019s with someone who disputed the accuracy of the two-metre mark which, in the absence of a tape measure \u2013 and if we hadn\u2019t been let in that minute \u2013 would have definitely resulted in me lying down on the ground, going: \u201cIs this, or is this not, 22cm longer than me?\u201d I found a hack, which is that people very rarely queue outside the mini-supermarkets attached to garages, and for a while that is the only place I went, and all we ate was Ginsters pasties and string cheese. The queue outside the fish and chip shop looked like party central, since a lot of us already knew each other from dog walking. But it was like turning up single to a swingers\u2019 party. We were hollow and speechless without our dogs. Maybe we had never been talking in the first place; maybe it was just the dogs that were talking? I shuffled away shyly, saying: \u201cNext time, I\u2019ll definitely bring Romeo.\u201d But I was thinking: \u201cThe only way that queue would have been worse is if my dog had been in it. I guess that\u2019s the end of fish and chips.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>There was never any reason for this to change, and yet, slowly, subtly, it did. If you make your calculations finely enough now, you can arrive at a shop without any queue, and glide around feeling magnificent, as if you have paid for a VIP fast-track at Legoland. So it is better, but it is also worse, because the resignation that had set in has now evaporated, and the dismay when you arrive to find a line is as fresh as it was in March. It is probably something the mindfulness racket could solve \u2013 what is a queue, after all, but a pocket of me-time, weightless, devoid of any duty but to exist and move along when instructed? It should be possible to enjoy it. But I would rather live on string cheese.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>I spent a lot of last year walking to and from hospital. On the way, I would pass an unprepossessing patch of grass, optimistically referred to as the local park, and consider how fantastically bleak it was that for our neighbourhood, this \u2013 <em>this</em> \u2013 constituted a public space.</p> <p>I\u2019d contrast it with sprawling, endless Hyde Park, my favourite spot in London, aside from when it\u2019s commandeered by irresponsible fringe lunatics holding their toxic rallies (Michael Bubl\u00e9\u2019s British Summer Time concert, 2018).</p> <p>This place, in comparison, was limp and joyless, with sad, bare little trees, a scrap of lawn and a squat hut in one corner that turned out on closer inspection to be a sewage pumping station \u2013 a northerner\u2019s idea of what a London green space is like.</p> <p>In the past few months, which I have spent largely trapped in one room, the park has begun to resemble the garden of Eden.</p> <p>Away from the vast, unimaginable tragedies and the small, stinging necessities of the real pandemic, there are the quirks of lockdown. And while our experiences are all different, they are not very different \u2013 that is one of the quirks.</p> <p>The great revelation for me has been the way that our worlds have become atomised, and how they have shrunk. For those of us still working, the fragmentation of office life has removed all sorts of mental barriers. Everything suddenly seems more manageable and less intimidating. I am forever talking one-on-one, with no one to overhear, and everyone\u2019s lives on partial display; apologising for the washing machine in the background, or breaking off to ask a child to shut up. The glorious anarchy of real life has breached the po-faced masquerade of the corporate world. We are all <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/mar/14/robert-kelly-children-interrupt-live-bbc-interview-south-korea\">Prof Robert Kelly now</a>.</p> <p>The shrinking has been interesting too \u2013 and ironic. For the first time since I came to London, I know my neighbours. And now I know them, I can\u2019t go within two metres of them. Or within three fridges of them, if we\u2019re using the new national system of measurement.</p> <p>The wallpaper of my life has been pulled down, so I have had to hang a new one. I sit by the window to work, and I have got used to the rhythms of other people\u2019s lives in a way that usually only happens when you\u2019re close to someone. There\u2019s the woman across the street who stands outside smoking and, when she sees someone she knows, illuminates from within like a plastic snowman. There\u2019s the teenager who takes his football for a walk every afternoon, the straps of his mask cutting into his towering bouffant; the pregnant lady in the gargantuan ice-white trainers; the bloke with the motorbike and the Queen hoodie. I am so grateful for this pantomime of familiarity that I\u2019m not even going to be rude about Queen. During the weekly clap for frontline workers, we would all smile quietly at one another.&nbsp;Life&nbsp;resembles a wholesome <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/jul/25/my-favourite-hitchcock-rear-window\">Rear Window</a>.</p> <p>Other film homages have been less enjoyable to live through. I don\u2019t dare venture as far as Hyde Park because the walk to get there is too busy. I went once, on the last day before lockdown, and Kensington High Street possessed the chilled out ambience and heartening community spirit of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/mar/26/dvdreviews.shopping7\">Dawn of the Dead</a>.</p> <p>My favourite escape routes, then \u2013 a large, cherished park, the intensity of live music \u2013 are out of bounds. But just as strangers have stepped unknowingly into the void left by friendly faces, so the small familiar area around my house has risen to its challenge. Not just the sun-baked streets of early summer, but the red brick and blue plaques, the houses that tumble down the road from the terracotta tube station, and that small neighbourhood green space I used to malign.</p> <p>I took a notebook there to finish this piece. Walking anywhere now is slightly stressful: I\u2019m an absolutist about social distancing, so spend most of the journey in the road. That was intimidating even before <a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/nick-ferrari/michael-gove-driving-eyesight-cummings-baranard/\">Michael Gove</a> suggested that anyone worried about their eyesight should immediately drive a car.</p> <p>Outside the park there is one world \u2013 PRACTISE SAFE DISTANCING, screams a banner strapped to the railings \u2013 and inside there is another, as the leaves at the entrance, turned half-spectral by the sun, reach down to lift you away. The grass is burnt, worn and bare already,&nbsp;but with a beauty of its own, and around the walls, penned in by houses,&nbsp;are&nbsp;untold&nbsp;gradations of green.&nbsp;In the middle-distance, the trees look shaggy and stoned.</p> <p>The park is made of irregular, impractical shapes, fenced off from one another by low, black railings, for which there must be some invisible reason. Now I love its imperfections like you love a person\u2019s imperfections, its limitations and flaws. There is a misshapen stone slab in the middle of the grass, and a hole where there was once a tree. The day before, I was almost decapitated there by a Frisbee.</p> <p>Someone has chalked EID MUBARAK on the concrete. Further along there are rainbows and the outlines of dancing people. Amid all the hurt there is some measure of happiness.</p> <p>As our worlds have shrunk, my park has grown, and I have grown to love it.</p> <p>\u2022 Rick Burin is a writer from the north of England<br></p>",

In your position as ambassador we seek reassurances that British journalists will be able to work in the US without fear of arrest and that you will do everything in your power to ensure that this potential international precedent is not set.<br><br>To this end we call on an immediate condemnation of the arrest by the ambassador, and all American officials based in the UK.<br><br>We also call on an immediate inquiry not only into the arrest of Omar Jimenez but into the treatment of all black journalists and journalists of colour by American authorities.<br><br>We call on the immediate suspension of the police officers involved in the arrest of Jimenez and his team until this inquiry is complete.<br><br>We stand in solidarity with Omar Jimenez and all journalists of colour who are reporting on racism in America.<br><br>Yours sincerely,<br><br>Marcus Ryder (Acting Chair of the Sir Lenny Henry Centre for Media Diversity)</em></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed27be68f087122eca527b2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-30T15:37:41.592Z\">4.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The Kentucky governor, Andy Beshear</strong>, has followed Minnesota\u2019s lead by <strong>calling in the National Guard</strong>.

That\u2019s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The president was at home as protesters gathered outside the White House and he commending the US secret service for its job guarding him. </p> \n  <p>But he doesn\u2019t really do calls for calm and unifying rhetoric. Trump, remember, tweeted on Friday \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">was censored by Twitter</a>, then claimed he hadn\u2019t known the inflammatory and racist nature of the phrase, let alone had intended to call for violence against his own citizens.</p> \n  <p>On Friday night, hundreds of demonstrators gathered across the street from the White House in Lafayette Square. Here\u2019s the AP report: </p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Protesters <strong>hurled pieces of bricks, bottles and other objects at Secret Service and US Park Police officers</strong> who were in riot gear behind barricades around the White House. Protesters at times kicked and punched officers and wrestled over the barricades.</p> \n   <p>The crowd of hundreds chanted \u201cNo justice, no peace\u201d and \u201cSay his name: George Floyd\u201d.</p> \n   <p>As some in the crowd grew more aggressive, <strong>police deployed pepper spray </strong>to maintain a perimeter of officers around the White House. Demonstrators came to the aid of protesters who were sprayed, their eyes red and puffy, offering bottles of milk and water to splash on their faces.</p> \n   <p>By the end of the night, the protesters had stolen about 15 barricades and left police to form a line of officers holding riot shields to keep back the swelling crowd. At one point, the protesters were able to gain control of an officer\u2019s shield and set it ablaze before trying to toss it back at the line of officers. Police used a smoke device to quickly stop them.</p> \n   <p>The protest went on for hours before police declared the gathering \u201cunlawful\u201d and ordered everyone to leave the seven-acre public park. Dozens of officers pushed forward with their shields and <strong>fired off streams of pepper spray at protesters</strong>.</p> \n   <p>Some protesters broke the bricks from the pavement and hurled chunks at the officers. Police did not immediately provide any information about arrests.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The president\u2019s Saturday message is also worth quoting in full:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cGreat job last night at the White House by the US <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SecretService\">@SecretService</a>.

The front line was replaced with fresh agents, like magic. </p> \n   <p>\u201cBig crowd, professionally organized, but nobody came close to breaching the fence.

I saw what was happening in China and Italy and decided I wouldn\u2019t travel to Gibraltar. Then obviously he went there and pinched the money off me. I was a little surprised that the tournament went ahead but I think I did the right thing by not going.\u201d</p> <p>Robertson has had nearly three months to stew on that decision but has a chance for delayed revenge when he and Trump compete in the first top-level post-lockdown snooker tournament, the Championship League event that starts in Milton Keynes on Monday.</p> <p>Other than the complete absence of spectators, a slightly standoffish referee and the presence of two sets of rests to ensure there is no need for sharing, television viewers might not notice much of a difference from any ordinary competition.

Not many players have tables at home, they like going to a club and feeling like they\u2019re going to a place of work.

It\u2019s not like football, where there\u2019s a huge margin of error with touch and passing and shooting. With snooker you\u2019re talking about millimetre precision and your technique can vary a lot if you don\u2019t retain muscle memory. Snooker is probably one of the most technical sports in the world, which is why it\u2019s so important to get the guys playing and practising again.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The American standup&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/10/patton-oswalt-bereavement-without-daughter-drinking-would-have-been-problem\">Patton Oswalt</a>\u2019s last special, <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80177406?source=35\">Annihilation</a>&nbsp;(2017), addressed the sudden death of his wife, the true-crime writer Michelle McNamara. It was widely admired, though not \u2013 obviously \u2013 for its surfeit of joyous comedy. That\u2019s where&nbsp;I Love Everything&nbsp;comes in. It finds Oswalt, now 51, blissfully remarried, and delivering a frothy set about ageing, parenting and his theory of Jesus. As per <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/feb/26/influence-standups-bill-hicks\">Bill Hicks</a> on comedy and people getting hurt, midlife contentment (\u201cBeing married is the best!\u201d) isn\u2019t always the richest territory for standup. But Oswalt\u2019s turn of phrase and cuddly curmudgeon persona keep the laughs coming \u2013 even if they\u2019re seldom of the belly variety.</p> <p>He sets out his stall early, announcing his half-century. There\u2019s a cliche about wanting to be racist in his dotage and a routine about breakfast foods getting boring as you age. The latter is not unusual here, both in slightly outstaying its welcome (a later routine on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/apr/07/sincerely-louis-ck-review-standup-comedy-me-too\">Louis CK</a> does the same) and in its diverting writerly flourishes: \u201cI\u2019m eating cereal that tastes like an unpopular teenager\u2019s poetry \u2026\u201d The loss of one\u2019s youth is as trusty a standup subject as they come, and Oswalt wrings the first third of his set from his newfound love of hiking, the effort now required to have sex (it\u2019s compared, eye-catchingly, to an understaffed McDonald\u2019s), and \u2013 funniest of all \u2013 his dismay at hard-bodied fitness freaks.&nbsp;</p> <p>The show\u2019s engagement with current affairs is glancing, although Oswalt\u2019s sole political gag (less about Trump than about being a comedian in the age of Trump) is very good. There\u2019s also that section on \u201cjerking off to the unwilling\u201d, which marvels at the sexual peccadilloes of Oswalt\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/09/louis-ck-accused-by-five-women-of-sexual-misconduct-in-new-report\">unnamed former colleague</a>. It generates a frisson that can\u2019t be matched by material about our host\u2019s wallpaper sub-contractor, or by an unconvincing skit about his anxiety that his recent wedding went too smoothly.</p> <p>I found the foundations of Oswalt\u2019s Jesus section a bit wobbly: the messiah\u2019s activities are remembered, he suggests, only because no one else behaved altruistically in biblical times. Not for the first time, one wonders whether a US standup routine about Christianity needs an audience in the US (where Christianity is more of a going concern) to really fly. Likewise, Oswalt\u2019s closer about the fast-food chain Denny\u2019s \u2013 which it\u2019s possible to enjoy as a non-American but would be richer if we\u2019d had the dubious pleasure of experiencing Denny\u2019s ourselves.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFNWNBWadrw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NFNWNBWadrw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>If by the end of Oswalt\u2019s hour you find yourself craving something more offbeat or abrasive, there\u2019s a bonus set on offer from veteran comic Bob Rubin, whom Oswalt introduces as \u201ca huge influence\u201d. Rubin\u2019s set, Oddities and Rarities,&nbsp;has a much stronger flavour than Oswalt\u2019s. It\u2019s also harder to stomach. Bug-eyed and barking, he totes paranoid fantasies and tales of narcotic misadventure. It\u2019s like Kramer from Seinfeld crossed with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/feb/08/tony-law-review-leicester-square-theatre-london-standup-comedy\">loopy Canadian standup Tony Law</a>&nbsp;\u2013 but less funny than either, and more inclined to fetishise his own kraziness.</p> <p>Netflix calls it \u201ca wild ride [and] something really, really different\u201d \u2013 which, by the standards of Netflix comedy, it probably is. There are some choice lines, but Rubin\u2019s brand of wildness starts feeling samey, and fails to conceal some witless routines, like the one about Uber, or the one speculating lamely on the origins of Stonehenge. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but the pill-poppin\u2019, law-breakin\u2019 anecdote that ends his set makes Oswalt\u2019s midlife hiking habit seem thrilling by comparison.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81206879\">Patton Oswalt: I Love Everything in available on Netflix</a>.</p></li> </ul>",

He will also expand the list of countries invited to attend the rescheduled event to include Australia, Russia, South Korea and India. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One during his return to Washington from Cape Canaveral in Florida, Donald Trump said the G7 in its current format was a \u201cvery outdated group of countries\u201d. He added: \u201cI\u2019m postponing it because I don\u2019t feel that as a G7 it properly represents what\u2019s going on in the world.\u201d</p> <h2>Concerns of UK test, track and trace system</h2> <p>British ministers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/coronavirus-test-and-trace-system-creating-false-sense-of-security\">have been accused of creating a \u201cfalse sense of security</a>\u201d by launching a system that is not yet capable of controlling local outbreaks. A series of concerns have been raised over the gaps in the test, track and trace system launched last week, with local health chiefs warning that they have not been given the time, powers or data to prepare for outbreaks in their area. They said that they were given details of their roles just four working days before the health secretary, Matt Hancock, launched test and trace last week.</p> <h2>Spanish lockdown to be extended</h2> <p>Spain\u2019s&nbsp;prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/31/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-pass-6-million-as-brazil-sees-record-one-day-increase?page=with:block-5ed37ac48f08f5e373011bbb#block-5ed37ac48f08f5e373011bbb\">has said he will ask parliament to agree</a> to a last two-week extension of the state of emergency lockdown until 21 June, after which the government will no longer restrict citizens\u2019 movements, newspaper <a href=\"https://elpais.com/espana/2020-05-31/sanchez-confirma-a-los-presidentes-autonomicos-que-pedira-una-ultima-prorroga-del-estado-de-alarma-hasta-el-21-de-junio.html\">El Pa</a><a href=\"https://elpais.com/espana/2020-05-31/sanchez-confirma-a-los-presidentes-autonomicos-que-pedira-una-ultima-prorroga-del-estado-de-alarma-hasta-el-21-de-junio.html\">\u00eds reported.</a> Pedro Sanchez told regional government leaders that this would be the last lockdown as infection rates have reduced dramatically in one of the European countries worst hit by the pandemic.

The death toll in Brazil from Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, increased to 28,834, with 956 new deaths in the last 24 hours, the ministry said.</p> <h2><strong>Los Angeles shuts down Covid-19 testing amid protests.</strong></h2> <p>Coronavirus testing centres in Los Angeles, California have been closed owing to safety concerns amid protests over the death of George Floyd, according to the city\u2019s mayor, Eric Garcetti.</p> <h2><strong>South Korea reports 27 new cases</strong></h2> <p>South Korea has reported 27 new cases, including 21 from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where officials have been scrambling to stem transmissions linked to clubgoers and warehouse workers. The figures announced by South Korea\u2019s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday brought national totals to 11,468 cases and 270 deaths. Twelve of the new cases were linked to international arrivals.</p> <h2>Two of Islam\u2019s holiest sites re-open</h2> <p>Large numbers of mosques across Saudi Arabia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/31/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-pass-6-million-as-brazil-sees-record-one-day-increase?page=with:block-5ed35c7c8f084df971c8cde8#block-5ed35c7c8f084df971c8cde8\">have reopened </a>for the first time in more than two months, but worshipers have been ordered to follow strict guidelines to prevent the spread of the coronavirus as Mecca remained closed to the public.

The ritual has been a weekly expression of gratitude to medical workers, and national pride in a state-run health service said to be the envy of the world.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s not forget,\u201d Boris Johnson said in early March, near the start of the coronavirus crisis, \u201cwe already have a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-coronavirus-press-conference-3-march-2020\">fantastic NHS,</a> fantastic testing systems and fantastic surveillance of the spread of disease.\u201d</p> <p>Yet those who have experienced the government\u2019s emerging testing and tracing operations for Covid-19 have had limited contact with the NHS. Instead, Britons with symptoms are directed to a network of 50 drive-through testing centres, set up by management consultants at Deloitte.</p> <p>Upon arrival, patients are marshalled not by NHS staff, but workers in hi-vis jackets supplied by outsourcing companies, such as Serco, G4S, Mitie and Sodexo. Those who cannot make the drive have received postal test kits, processed by the private diagnostics company Randox and delivered by Amazon.</p> <p>When contact tracing to stop the spread of the virus finally moved up the agenda in late April, the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, said <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-23-april-2020\">the job</a> would be done with an as\u2013yet unproven NHS app. The app has been developed by private firms for NHSX, the technology wing of the health service, which is also responsible for a Covid-19 government data operation involving tech companies Palantir, Faculty, Amazon, Google and Microsoft.</p> <p>On Thursday the government finally launched its long-awaited NHS Test and Trace Service. But despite the name, many of the 25,000 contact tracers tracking those potentially exposed to Covid-19 and advising them to self-isolate will be working not for the NHS, but rather the outsourcing firms Serco and Sitel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/testing-flowchart-zip/giv-3902BxUIKiVHGDMV/\" data-alt=\"Testing infrastructure\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/testing-flowchart-zip/giv-3902BxUIKiVHGDMV/\">Testing infrastructure</a> </figure>  <p>The government\u2019s reliance on private contractors during the public health emergency comes after a decade of public sector reorganisation, marketisation and deep cuts to services and local government in England. The Guardian has interviewed dozens of public health directors, politicians, experts in infectious disease control, government scientific and political advisers, NHS leaders and emergency planners about the years leading up to the pandemic.</p> <p>They described how an infrastructure that was once in place to respond to public health crises was fractured, and in some places demolished, by policies introduced by recent Conservative governments, with some changes going as far back as Labour\u2019s years in power.</p> <p>\u201cThe undermining of our responsiveness to a pandemic was one of my major concerns,\u201d said Gabriel Scally, a professor of public health at the University of Bristol and a former regional director of public health in the NHS for almost 20 years. \u201cThere has been a destruction of the infrastructure that stops England coping with major emergencies. It absolutely explains why you\u2019re now seeing private companies being brought into these functions.\u201d</p> <h2>Councils left in the dark</h2> <p>Local authorities are the Cinderellas of government, their work often overlooked. But in the middle of a public health crisis, counties, districts and boroughs traditionally become the foot soldiers of national response. Few have been as badly hit as the east London borough of Newham, the local authority with the highest Covid-19 mortality rate in England and Wales.</p> <p>Yet Newham\u2019s director of public health, Jason Strelitz, was left in the dark at the start. He had no official notification that the virus had arrived in his area in mid-March, and only found out when he logged on to the government\u2019s public coronavirus tracker web page to make his daily check on the declared numbers. Strelitz did not know who in Newham had Covid-19, where they had been tested, or which part of the borough they came from.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re really concerned about the way national testing has been set up,\u201d Strelitz said. \u201cWe still don\u2019t have a clear picture of who is being tested in our area nor of the extent of community transmission in Newham.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81c1fc9fd1174ab1ca7d1417a9310c2de5419d02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81c1fc9fd1174ab1ca7d1417a9310c2de5419d02/1100_1065_4876_2927/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jason Strelitz at the Covid-19 hub for local authority action in Newham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jason Strelitz at the Covid-19 hub for local authority action in Newham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In normal times, a Public Health England (PHE) representative would be expected to contact Strelitz\u2019s environmental health teams if a case of a notifiable disease was found in the area that needed following up, enabling them to set to work tracing contacts and containing an outbreak. But the government had just abandoned community testing and tracing so local authorities were not being contacted at that point.</p> <p>Newham is among the most deprived boroughs in the country. Like all the public health directors interviewed by the Guardian, Strelitz has deep knowledge of the characteristics of his patch that make its health inequalities so stark and its residents so vulnerable to the disease. About 30,000 people have been identified by the council as being at high risk \u2013 many of them over 70, living alone and isolated.</p> <p>Even now, with large-scale community testing resumed, Strelitz said he was not receiving useful test data from the centralised, privately contracted operation created by Hancock. He also has concerns about the contact-tracing operation being set up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Covid-19%3A%20help%20us%20investigate&amp;description=The%20Guardian%20is%20investigating%20how%20the%20UK%20government%20prepared%20for%20%E2%80%93%20and%20is%20responding%20to%20%E2%80%93%20the%20coronavirus%20pandemic.%20We%20want%20to%20learn%20more%20about%20recent%20decisions%20taken%20at%20the%20heart%20of%20government.%20If%20you%E2%80%99re%20a%20whistleblower%20or%20source%20and%20with%20new%20information%2C%20you%20can%20email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Acovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Ecovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20(using%20a%20non-work%20phone)%20use%20Signal%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447584640566%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566.%20(The%20number%20does%20not%20take%20calls.)%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E.%20For%20general%20advice%20on%20confidentially%20contacting%20the%20Guardian%2C%20see%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.%20&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"The Guardian is investigating how the UK government prepared for \u2013 and is responding to \u2013 the coronavirus pandemic.

Working on a salary just above minimum wage, the majority will have no medical training. Using scripts, they will contact those who have tested positive, trace people they have been in contact with, and advise them on how to isolate.</p> <p>\u201cContact tracing is a sensitive issue \u2013 I\u2019m not sure how well it can be done with a remote call centre with no understanding of people\u2019s local context,\u201d Strelitz said.</p> <p>Dominic Harrison, the director of public health for Blackburn and Darwen, has similar concerns. Speaking earlier this month he said there was \u201ca huge disconnect\u201d between different branches of government, with some functions of the local public health system having been disabled in recent years.</p> <p>\u201cPeople like environmental health officers, community and neighbourhood teams, youth services workers \u2013 the people who you could deploy in a crisis, who already know where the vulnerable are and how to reach them \u2013 those were the kind of staff they used during 2009 swine flu to work closely with the NHS, but they have been lost,\u201d Harrison said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"521ac9437d4b150001bbeea161c2256e8c59e7a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/521ac9437d4b150001bbeea161c2256e8c59e7a1/0_35_3878_2328/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Council workers in Hull disinfect pavements and structures to guard against the transmission of coronavirus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Council workers in Hull disinfect pavements and structures to guard against the transmission of coronavirus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lindsey Parnaby/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Labour leader of Nottingham city council, David Mellen, said Conservative ministers had spent so many years shrinking the state locally \u201cthey have forgotten what local authorities can do\u201d. Nottingham has had its central government support grant cut by 80% since 2013 and, like many other councils, no longer has reserves for emergencies such as coronavirus. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has made an emergency grant of \u00a33.2bn to councils for Covid-19 costs, which the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, has <a href=\"https://mhclgmedia.blog.gov.uk/2020/05/14/response-to-lewis-goodall-newsnight-on-local-authority-funding/\">defended</a> as fair and generous. Mellen disagrees. Nottingham, he said, had been given \u00a319.8m as its share of the exceptional grant, but had already spent well over \u00a312m extra on Covid-19 while losing at least \u00a319m in revenue because of the lockdown.</p> <p>A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson did not dispute that cuts to central government grants could have had an impact on local public health networks. However, she pointed to the \u00a33.2bn emergency funding for councils, which she said was in addition to an increase of \u00a32.9bn in councils\u2019 core spending power this year. \u201cProtecting the public\u2019s health is, and has always been, a priority for the UK government,\u201d she said.</p> <h2>A decade of austerity</h2> <p>Next month, Britain will mark an anniversary many Conservative ministers would rather forget. Shortly after 12.30pm on 22 June 2010, George Osborne stepped up to the dispatch box as chancellor of the new coalition government and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/22/emergency-budget-full-speech-text\">announced</a> the longest and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/23/budget-longest-deepest-cuts-ifs\">deepest period of cuts</a> to public service spending since the second world war.</p> <p>Ushering in a new age of austerity to a raucous Commons, Osborne outlined \u00a381bn of cuts over five years. His aim was twofold: to eliminate the government\u2019s budget deficit and to reduce its debt as a share of GDP. The emergency budget would, he said, bring the country back from the brink of ruin. \u201cIt pays for the past. It plans for the future. And it protects the most vulnerable in our society,\u201d Osborne told MPs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=60%25&amp;title=cut%20in%20local%20authority%20funding%20from%20government%20since%202010\" data-alt=\"60% cut in local authority funding\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&number=60%25&title=cut%20in%20local%20authority%20funding%20from%20government%20since%202010\">60% cut in local authority funding</a> </figure>  <p>It was the prime minister, David Cameron, who had the previous year introduced the notion of \u201cthe age of irresponsibility giving way to the age of austerity\u201d. He said he expected the public spending cuts would be permanent as the private and voluntary sectors stepped in to deliver public services better than the state could. Some government departments would be cut by a third and most public sector workers would have to accept a pay freeze.</p> <p>Along with welfare, some of the most brutal reductions were imposed on local government in England as Osborne transferred the political risk of austerity to councils. Over the next decade, local authorities had 60% of their funding from central government cut, <a href=\"http://www.local.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/5.40_01_Finance%20publication_WEB_0.pdf\">according to the Local Government Association</a>. At the same time their ability to increase council tax, to try to replace the lost revenue, was capped. The cuts <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/blog/public-health-cuts#anounce-of-prevention-is-worth-a-pound-of-cure\">fell disproportionately</a> on those authorities with the poorest populations.</p> <p>Cameron promised he would \u201ccut the deficit, not the NHS\u201d and Osborne ringfenced its budget. It got cash increases, but these were less than 1% a year, and failed to keep pace with growing demand from an ageing population.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=32%2C000&amp;title=overnight%20hospital%20beds%20cut%20in%20England%20since%202008-9\" data-alt=\"32,000 overnight beds lost since 2008-09\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&number=32%2C000&title=overnight%20hospital%20beds%20cut%20in%20England%20since%202008-9\">32,000 overnight beds lost since 2008-09</a> </figure>  <p>Approximately 32,000 overnight beds have been <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/bed-availability-and-occupancy/bed-data-overnight/\">lost</a> from hospitals in England in just over a decade, including some lost under Labour.

Despite Cameron\u2019s pre-election promise that there would be no more pointless, <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/never-again\">disruptive top-down reorganisations</a>, critics argue that Lansley\u2019s 2012 Health and Social Care Act did just that.</p> <p>Labour had done its fair share of subjecting the NHS to upheaval. Its programme of building new hospitals under the private finance initiative required other hospital and community health services to close, and shrank bed numbers to help cover the high annual fees to private companies. It accelerated changes brought in by the Conservatives to mimic a market, and created NHS trusts that could operate as semi-autonomous corporate bodies. By 2006, Labour\u2019s reorganisations had created 152 primary care trusts (PCTs). Overarching priorities were set by regional strategic health authorities and the Department of Health.</p> <p>But every area still had a Public Health Observatory, which included infectious disease control teams. Under government pandemic plans, each had to identify rapid response teams for testing and tracing, and these were activated during the swine flu outbreak in 2009.</p> <p>Health authorities also had consultants in communicable disease control appointed at senior level on a par with NHS hospital consultants. An independent public body, the Health Protection Agency (HPA), provided specialist support on the threat of emerging diseases. There were critics of the structures, but in planning for emergencies there was, at least, a clear chain of command and control. \u201cLabour started the process of fragmenting public health but it was at least still integrated with communicable disease control and the NHS,\u201d Pollock said.</p> <p>Lansley\u2019s legislation did away with much of that. He abolished PCTs and strategic health authorities. Instead, existing public health structures were stripped out of the NHS and redistributed, along with their budgets and staff. In a dramatic shift, local authorities were given responsibility for public health for their areas, with larger ones being required to appoint a director of public health.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77b765152eca3e8ecdfdd92638bb843b4263bb2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77b765152eca3e8ecdfdd92638bb843b4263bb2c/0_200_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Andrew Lansley speaking with staff at Frimley Park hospital in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Andrew Lansley speaking with staff at Frimley Park hospital in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey took a perfectly well-functioning public health system and fractured it,\u201d said Julie Hotchkiss, a PCT director with responsibility for emergency pandemic response who moved to York city council during the changes.

She regards the transfer of public health to local authorities as \u201cincredibly important and positive\u201d. But she adds: \u201cIt\u2019s a very big job and the transition came at a time of cuts to the public sector, not just to local government, although those were huge.\u201d</p> <p>Lansley\u2019s act also created an entirely new agency that has been at the centre of the response to the coronavirus outbreak: Public Health England. It was given two primary responsibilities: improving health and reducing inequalities by tackling \u201clifestyle\u201d diseases, such as obesity; and protecting the public from infectious diseases and environmental hazards.</p> <p>The HPA, which had previously taken a lead on infectious disease control, was folded into PHE. Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, argues the result of all these new arrangements was \u201ca hugely weakened and fragmented public health system with consequences writ large in Covid-19\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=%C2%A3850m&amp;title=cut%20from%20the%20government%20public%20health%20grant%20to%20local%20authorities%20since%202015\" data-alt=\"\u00a3850m cut to public health grant since 2015\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&number=%C2%A3850m&title=cut%20from%20the%20government%20public%20health%20grant%20to%20local%20authorities%20since%202015\">\u00a3850m cut to public health grant since 2015</a> </figure>  <p>The DHSC rejected the suggestion that the system was fragmented and that changes had affected the government\u2019s ability to respond.

Combating health threats, such as pandemics, was \u201cno more or less fragmented\u201d after 2013, Lansley said, and the problem was not the new structures or moving public health to local government but money. \u201cOur intention was for a real-terms increase in public health budgets alongside those for the NHS, but this was not followed through from 2015 onwards,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The ringfenced annual grant for public health from central government to local authorities \u2013 currently about \u00a33.2bn \u2013 has been cut by a cumulative \u00a3850m in real terms since 2015-16, according to <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/sites/default/files/2020-01/LGA%20PH%20reforms%20-%20final.pdf\">the King\u2019s Fund</a> review.</p> <p>During his two-decade career in government, Scally had been involved in emergency responses for swine flu, foot and mouth, BSE, and the fuel crisis. For previous epidemics, he said, the government took \u201ca public health approach; go in quick and hard, test, trace, isolate, throw everything at it\u201d. But, he said, \u201cthe whole system was demolished\u201d by Lansley\u2019s changes, which led him to resign.</p> <p>He then worked as an adviser for Labour\u2019s former shadow health secretary, Andy Burnham, who is now the mayor of Greater Manchester. Burnham recalls Scally constantly warning him as Lansley\u2019s bill was going through parliament that \u201cwe were losing pandemic preparedness\u201d.</p> <h2>Testing time for Public Health England</h2> <p>No branch of government appears to have received more flak over its handling of the Covid-19 outbreak than Public Health England. The government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/england-coronavirus-testing-has-not-risen-fast-enough-science-chief\">suggested it had failed</a> to expand testing at the right moment. Its top executive has been criticised by leading public health experts, such as Prof Anthony Costello of University College London, for being \u201cinvisible\u201d.</p> <p>Even before the outbreak, the agency was a target of complaints from across the spectrum. Leftwing critics have accused PHE of failing to be tough enough in its role of promoting better health. The right has accused it of being the instrument of a nanny state with a bloated budget. PHE has had precious few political friends. But even those who might be natural allies \u2013 like Prof John Ashton, the former regional director of public health for north-west England \u2013 suggest it has \u201chad a bad Covid war\u201d.</p> <p>Some of this might be down to bad luck. Its chief executive, Duncan Selbie, caught the virus along with key advisers in Westminster, and its&nbsp;emeritus medical director and director for health protection&nbsp;until 2019, Prof Paul Cosford, has cancer and has been self-isolating, although both have been working throughout.</p> <p>However, there have also been structural challenges. The Lansley act created an agency that lacked independence from government, in contrast to its predecessor, the HPA. That has led to suspicions that some PHE decisions were politically influenced, such as the varying guidance on what kind of personal protective equipment (PPE) was needed for frontline staff treating Covid-19 patients. In late March, PHE said a lower specification of protective gowns than previously advised could be used, leading <a href=\"https://www.gmb.org.uk/news/trust-draining-away-over-dangerous-downgrade-ppe-guidance\">unions to accuse</a> it of basing decisions on shortages of PPE, rather than evidence.

It says the guidance on PPE has been misunderstood: it was offering a solution in the event of extreme shortages.</p> <p>\u201cOur track record speaks for itself,\u201d a PHE spokesperson said. \u201cDuring 2018-19 alone, we responded to more than 10,000 disease outbreaks and emergencies across England, including meningitis, measles, E coli and the first ever UK case of monkeypox. Our flu vaccination programme grows every year and cases of TB have fallen to the lowest level since records began.\u201d They said that far from being invisible, Selbie had been at the coalface, helping to advise government on its decision-making.</p> <p>The DHSC spokesperson cited a <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/661350/PHE-Evaluation_and_Recommendations.pdf\">positive report</a> by the International Association of National Public Health Institutes, which described PHE as a \u201cstrong, capable, coordinated, united and efficient public health agency\u201d. The report only examined PHE and not the public health systems devolved to local authorities. The same report pointed out that \u201cthere is scope for greater clarity in the responsibilities of PHE\u2019s local partners\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=%C2%A040%25&amp;title=cut%20to%20PHE%27s%20operational%20budget%20in%20real%20terms%20since%202013\" data-alt=\"40% cut to PHE operational budget\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&number=%C2%A040%25&title=cut%20to%20PHE%27s%20operational%20budget%20in%20real%20terms%20since%202013\">40% cut to PHE operational budget</a> </figure>  <p>In its defence, PHE has had to absorb disparate functions since its creation in 2013. And it too has been struck by austerity: a public health source said PHE\u2019s operational budget sustained a 40% real-terms cut between 2013 and 2019.</p> <p>It was PHE that initially had responsibility for testing, tracing and advising isolation for those who became infected. It was a huge and complicated task, but one the World Health Organization has made clear from the outset was the single most important thing countries could do to suppress the disease. The government\u2019s decision to abandon large-scale testing and tracing on 12 March remains one of its most controversial decisions.</p> <p>PHE says it reprioritised limited resources rather than abandoning tracing completely. \u201cWhen the lockdown began, our contact-tracing resource was refocused on to complex outbreaks in care homes, prisons and immigration centres,\u201d Selbie said. \u201cThe good news is, now that we have testing capacity in place and are working towards recovery, we can start mass contact tracing through the NHS test and trace programme.</p> <p>\u201cPHE\u2019s contact tracing during the \u2018\u2018contain\u2019 phase of the pandemic bought several weeks of time for the government and the NHS to prepare for what was to come, and has undoubtedly saved lives,\u201d he said.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></p></li> </ul> <p>Greg Clark, the chair of the Commons science and technology select committee, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52716828\">accused</a> PHE of choosing to \u201cconcentrate\u201d tests in its own limited number of labs rather than expanding capacity rapidly by using university and private labs, as the Germans and South Koreans had done, even though the need for mass testing was \u201cidentifiable from the beginning\u201d. PHE responded by blaming the DHSC, saying it was responsible for decisions on testing policy.</p> <p>The DHSC spokesperson said: \u201cAlthough Britain had a world-class pharmaceutical industry, it did not have the existing diagnostic base necessary to test hundreds of thousands of people each week for a new virus.\u201d She said the government had more than doubled the capacity of NHS and PHE laboratories since early March, with more than 3m tests carried out by mid-May, and that anyone with symptoms could now book a test.</p> <p>The government boasts that its new Test and Trace programme will mobilise an \u201carmy\u201d of contact tracers. But in the two months leading up to 12 March, PHE\u2019s team resembled no more than a small platoon. The Guardian has established it consisted of just 70 staff in its field services, 120 in local health protection teams, and 20 specially recruited clinical staff. In total, the contact tracing operation to manage the pandemic consisted of just 210 people.</p> <p>Documents released on Friday by the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) suggest the contact-tracing operation initially only envisaged the need to deal with a handful of cases a week. Minutes from an 18 February meeting of the group said: \u201cCurrently PHE can cope with five new cases a week (requiring isolation of 800 contacts).\u201d The minutes added: \u201cModelling suggests this capacity could be increased to 50 new cases a week (8,000 contact isolations) but this assumption needs to be stress-tested with PHE operational colleagues.\u201d</p> <p>Rather than ramp\u2013up capacity, the government scientists instead agreed in the same meeting they would need data \u201cto feed into trigger points for decisions on when the current monitoring and contact-tracing approach is no longer working\u201d. The minutes added: \u201cWhen there is sustained transmission in the UK, contact tracing will no longer be useful.\u201d</p> <p>PHE said&nbsp;the reference to five cases a week was based on modelling of how it would cope with tracking the contacts of imported cases of Covid-19. In a statement, it added:&nbsp;\u201cPHE&nbsp;could deal with 5 new cases a week&nbsp;and the associated isolation of 800 contacts \u2013 which was sufficient capacity at the time \u2013 and&nbsp;modelling suggested it had the capacity to scale up significantly as needed.\u201d</p> <p>However, two days later, at another Sage meeting, the advisers acknowledged \u201cindividual cases could already have been missed\u201d and again discussed when it would be appropriate to abandon the nascent operation. Appearing to acknowledge such a move would be controversial, the minutes said: \u201cAny decision to discontinue contact tracing will generate a public reaction&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;which requires consideration with input from behavioural scientists.\u201d</p> <p>By the time community tracing was shelvedin mid\u2013March, PHE had \u201ccontact traced\u201d only 3,500 people who were likely to have been in close proximity with infected people on flights, cruises or other places where there were known outbreaks. Of those, only 3% tested positive for Covid-19 and were advised to self-isolate.</p> <p>In other words, PHE had managed to identify and warn about 100 people with Covid-19 who might otherwise have spread the disease \u2013 a tiny fraction of the infected people. Vallance said there were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c9cf7d0-3d11-443e-a156-d111b333fd72\">5,000 confirmed</a> Covid cases when the community testing and tracing programme stopped, but epidemiologists at Imperial College London <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/18/sage-advice-britain-coronavirus-science-government-policy\">estimated</a> 1.8 million people in Britain were infected by the end of March.</p> <p>William Hanage, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Harvard University, said the numbers of PHE staff dedicated to contact tracing in Britain in the weeks leading up to mid-March was shocking. \u201cI am sure that the people involved in this programme worked incredibly hard, and I have the utmost respect for them, tasked with doing this in the face of a global pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it beggars belief to see these numbers held up as adequate.\u201d</p> <h2>The elusive 100,000 target</h2> <p>On 2 April, three weeks after capacity had been overwhelmed and PHE had abandoned testing in the community, Hancock <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/health-secretary-sets-out-plan-to-carry-out-100000-coronavirus-tests-a-day\">announced</a> a five-pillar testing plan. He pledged to scale up the country\u2019s testing capacity to reach a target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month.</p> <p>But the architecture created in the postwar years to respond to pandemics was no longer standing. In the past, the Public Health Laboratories Service had been tasked with disease control, and with coordinating support and advice to the NHS and others. In 2003, Labour folded it into the HPA. Fifty PHLS labs that existed two decades ago have been merged with hospital labs or \u201cconsolidated\u201d by successive governments to make efficiency savings. As of January this year, just eight laboratories remained under direct PHE control, along with <a href=\"https://improvement.nhs.uk/resources/pathology-networks/\">122 NHS labs</a> in England.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3d2ce9475aa9eb47dab9844d522a3a941cb52e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3d2ce9475aa9eb47dab9844d522a3a941cb52e6/0_49_3529_2118/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Hancock giving one of Downing Street\u2019s daily coronavirus press briefings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Hancock giving one of Downing Street\u2019s daily coronavirus press briefings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pippa Fowles/10 Downing Street/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hancock expected hospital labs testing patients and staff and PHE to make up 25,000 of the ambitious 100,000 target. For the other 75,000 he turned to the private sector. Deloitte, one of the big four accountancy firms, was asked to set up a network of 50 drive-through rapid testing centres, and yet more private companies, such as Serco, Sodexo, Mitie and G4S, would operate and manage the day-to-day running of them.</p> <p>A lab network to process the tests was also established. Deloitte was again given the coordinating role in the creation of new Lighthouse labs in Milton Keynes, Glasgow, Belfast and Cheshire and a further facility in Cambridge, with day-to-day running entrusted to a coalition of private and public partners, including universities and drug companies.</p> <p>But Hancock\u2019s 2 April announcement made no mention of one of the main purposes of testing: tracking or tracing.</p> <p>The Guardian soon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/hospitals-sound-alarm-over-privately-run-test-centre-in-surrey\">received reports</a> from people trying to get tested of chaos at some sites, with results going astray, dangerously leaking swab samples arriving at labs, queues of more than three hours and symptomatic people being unable to book a test or told to make round trips of more than 100 miles to test centres. Many still report results taking seven to 10 days to arrive \u2013 too long to be useful for quarantine purposes \u2013 but the DHSC maintains that 97% of test results are obtained within 48 hours.</p> <p>In the last week of April, the government <a href=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/2425455/\">changed its criteria</a> for counting tests to include ones that had been dispatched, even if they had not been received, returned or processed. The date of 30 April came and Hancock missed his 100,000 target; the number of tests conducted that day was 81,611. But the next day, on 1 May, he appeared to smash it, as 122,347 tests were recorded in government data. The magic number had, by Hancock\u2019s own admission, included nearly 30,000 postal tests sent out but not yet analysed. By 3 May the number was back down to 76,496, and the government would fail to meet its target for the next seven days, before getting back on track on 11 May.</p> <p>For Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents foundation trusts in England, Hancock\u2019s single-minded focus on reaching an arbitrary number cost the country another precious month. \u201cToo much of April was wasted by focusing on the 100,000 tests by 30 April target at the expense of other aspects of a clear strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe testing strategy, if there was one, got hijacked on the basis of just meeting that target when there were lots of other things that needed to be done.\u201d</p> <p>Hopson said the saga also illustrates the danger of trying to control testing from the centre. \u201cWe need to be ready to do test, track and trace in every part of the country. That can only be done effectively with greater local control.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>There\u2019s been a lot of argument about how best to handle the coronavirus pandemic, but if there are two things on which most people currently agree, it\u2019s that governments should have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/how-did-britain-get-its-response-to-coronavirus-so-wrong\">better prepared</a>, and that everyone should <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/may/19/returning-to-work-coronavirus-rights-notice-pay-cuts-safety\">get back to work</a> as soon as it is safe to do so. After all, it seems more or less self-evident that you need to be ready for unexpected contingencies \u2013 and that it is better for the economy to function at full capacity. More PPE would have saved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/23/emails-reveal-doctors-plea-for-ppe-before-covid-19-death-dr-peter-tun\">doctors\u2019 and nurses\u2019 lives</a>; more work means less unemployment and more growth.</p> <p>But there is a catch to this, and it has been at the heart of political debate since Machiavelli. It is impossible to achieve both goals at once. Contingency planning requires unused capacity, whereas exploiting every opportunity to the full means losing the flexibility needed to respond to sudden changes of fortune.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until the mid-20th century that economists started to realise that it might be better to leave a bit of slack in the economy to help cope with exogenous shocks. In the years after the Great Depression, governments saw the problem as \u201c<a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Lv5DDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;dq=idle+men,+idle+land,+idle+machines+and+idle+money&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HcgTePmsDv&amp;sig=ACfU3U24-iFOCp8pSouPgD4kRpKVMmeAag&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiymN7JlcfpAhUCXRUIHXkgBOQQ6AEwAHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=idle%20men%2C%20idle%20land%2C%20idle%20machines%20and%20idle%20money&amp;f=false\">idle men, idle land, idle machines and idle money</a>\u201d. But there were also economists, such as the Englishman <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Harold_Hutt\">William Hutt</a>, who went against the Keynesian consensus and pointed out that there were some things \u2013 fire extinguishers, for example \u2013 that were valuable precisely because they were never used. Having large stocks of PPE, underemployed nurses, or a lot of spare capacity in ICUs, falls into the same category. Idle resources are what you need in a crisis, so some degree of inefficiency isn\u2019t necessarily a bad idea.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/22/greening-economy-prosperity-financial-crisis-coronavirus\">We now have the proof: greening the economy doesn't come at the price of prosperity | Fiona Harvey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trying to manage a pandemic in a world of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_manufacturing\">just-in-time production lines</a> and precarious labour brings these issues into sharper focus. On the one hand, there weren\u2019t enough idle resources for most countries to cope adequately with the spread of the virus. On the other, the enforced idleness of the lockdown leads to calls to get the economy moving again.</p> <p>For Donald Trump, the prospect of a prolonged shutdown is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/06/coronavirus-update-cases-uk-live-news-us-task-force-trump-covid-19-usa-world-europe-deaths-brazil-brasil-israel\">particularly alarming</a> because it threatens to undermine the competitiveness of the US economy relative to other nations (notably China) that have dealt with the crisis more efficiently. That\u2019s an argument Machiavelli would have understood very well. One of his constant refrains was that idleness could lead to what he called corruption (the diversion of resources from the public good, which Trump equates with the Dow Jones Industrial Average) \u2013 and that corruption leads inevitably to defeat at the hands of your rivals.</p> <p>For Machiavelli, the contagion of corruption was spread above all by Christianity, a \u201creligion of idleness\u201d. And it is true that the Judeo-Christian tradition, with its sabbaths, jubilees, feast days, and religious specialists devoted to a life of prayer and contemplation rather than martial virtue, built a lot of slack into the system. Machiavelli thought it should be squeezed out through laws that would prevent surplus becoming the pretext for idleness, rather in the way that later economists looked to the pressure mechanism of competition to do the same.</p> <p>But there\u2019s a contradiction in Machiavelli\u2019s thinking here, because he also acknowledged that one of the things every polity needed was periodic renewal and reform, and that corruption was what preceded it. So you\u2019re in a double bind: either you can squeeze out the slack and never experience renewal, or you can court corruption and create an opportunity to start over and make things better.</p> <p>With hindsight it looks like that\u2019s one of the problems the religions of idleness tried to address, by incorporating idleness into the calendar. In ancient Hebrew tradition, there were weekly sabbaths, and every seventh year was meant to be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shmita\">a </a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shmita\">year of release</a> in which the land was left to lie fallow, debts were forgiven and slaves emancipated. The idea was picked up by the Chartist William Benbow, who in 1832 used it as the model for what he called a <a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/history/england/chartists/benbow-congress.htm\">Grand National Holiday</a>, in effect a month-long general strike that would allow a National Congress to reform society \u201cto obtain for all at the least expense to all, the largest sum of happiness for all\u201d.</p> <p>Benbow\u2019s plan came to nothing, but it provides an alternative model for how the lockdown might be viewed. The Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben <a href=\"https://www.journal-psychoanalysis.eu/coronavirus-and-philosophers/\">has complained that</a> the lockdown is a state of exception with an increase in executive powers and a partial abrogation of the rule of law; but the flipside is that it is the closest thing to a Grand National Holiday that most of us have ever experienced. Despite all the suffering the pandemic has caused, for many it has also meant no work, debt relief, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/03/uk-road-travel-falls-to-1955-levels-as-covid-19-lockdown-takes-hold-coronavirus-traffic\">empty roads</a> and a rare opportunity to live on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/12/uk-furlough-scheme-extended-rishi-sunak-coronavirus\">free money from the government</a>.</p> <p>Generally speaking, exogenous threats like wars or natural disasters act as pressure mechanisms forcing us to redouble our efforts to combat them together. The benefit of contagion is that the only way to combat it is to do less rather than more. That has some demonstrable advantages. There has been a dramatic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/19/lockdowns-trigger-dramatic-fall-global-carbon-emissions\">global fall in carbon emissions</a>. The only comparable reduction in greenhouse gases during the past 30 years came as the result of the decline of industrial production in eastern Europe after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2014/jul/14/soviet-union-collapse-in-pictures\">fall of communism</a>. That was managed exceptionally badly because neoliberal economists thought that what post-communist states needed was the pressure of free market competition. Shock therapy would galvanise the economy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/may/29/excess-deaths-uk-has-one-highest-levels-europe\">Coronavirus excess deaths: UK has one of highest levels in Europe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The pandemic has been a shock alright, but its effect has been the opposite of galvanising. People everywhere had to stop whatever they were doing or planning to do in the future. That provides an altogether different model of political change. The philosopher Walter Benjamin once noted that while Karl Marx claimed that revolutions were the locomotives of world history, things might actually turn out to be rather different: \u201cPerhaps revolutions are the human race \u2026 travelling in this train, reaching for the emergency brake.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone keeps saying that we are living through strange times, but what is strange about it is that because everything has come to a stop, it is as though we are living out of time. The emergency brake has been pulled and time is standing still. It feels uncanny, and there\u2019s more slack in the world economy than there ever has been before. And that means, as both Benjamin and Machiavelli would have recognised, that there is also a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for change and renewal.</p> <p>For some, this might mean a shorter working week, or less air travel. For others, it might suggest the opportunity for a more fundamental remaking of our political system. A space of possibility has unexpectedly opened up, so although the lockdown may be coming to an end, perhaps the standstill should continue.</p> <p>\u2022 Malcolm Bull teaches at Oxford.

This is the first time that Twitter has chosen to enforce its own rules when it came to the company\u2019s most famous and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-followed_Twitter_accounts\">eighth-most-followed account</a> (former president Barack Obama is first, much to Trump\u2019s frustration).</p> <p>Trump was reacting to the third night of anti-violence and anti-racist protests in Minneapolis, Minnesota. George Floyd, an African American man, died on Monday after a white police officer restrained Floyd by placing a knee on his neck for eight minutes while the dying man gasped, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Bystanders told police, \u201cHe is human\u201d and \u201cCheck his pulse.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/us/minneapolis-police-man-died.html\">Four officers were fired and </a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/us/minneapolis-police-man-died.html\">one is currently facing criminal charges for Floyd\u2019s death</a>. But the record of local prosecutors in the United States holding their own police officers accountable is poor.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/george-floyd-minneapolis-protests.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage#link-ecd3f95\">Protests also broke out in at least nine other American cities</a>, reminding Americans that their law enforcement systems too often consider African Americans disposable and beneath concern for their basic safety and human rights.</p> <p>Trump, who <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/otilliasteadman/trump-charlottesville-defend-white-supremacists\">has consistently sided with violent white supremacists</a> and has overseen anti-immigration policies that would stem ethnic diversity in the United States, issued a stern threat to anti-racist protesters in the covered tweet.&nbsp;</p> <p>Once Twitter users encountered the cover, they could click \u201cView\u201d to read the message from the president: \u201c\u2026 when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!\u201d</p> <p>So Trump\u2019s expression stands, adding to the evidence that the most powerful nation in history is run by an unhinged, petulant whiner who wants nothing more than to make people forget that more than 100,000 Americans have died this year because of Covid-19 and more than 40 million have lost jobs.&nbsp;</p> <p>Importantly, by letting the message stand, Twitter has started a conversation, not stopped it. Trump and his followers will whine about \u201ccensorship\u201d but their concerns are unlikely to concern any but those deeply committed to Trump\u2019s cause, which is overwhelmingly an attempt to disrupt any attempt to think clearly about the damage he has done.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter had several options in this case. It could have deleted the offending tweets, but that would have raised interest in them and risked making the conversation about deletion rather than about Trump\u2019s calls for violence. Twitter could have removed Trump\u2019s account entirely for repeatedly violating rules against inciting violence and spreading misinformation about public health and voting rights. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/commentisfree/2020/may/28/donald-trump-twitter-ban-social-media-order\">And there are strong arguments for doing just that</a>, not least of which is the fact that Trump uses Twitter to distract people from the crucial issues of the moment and his own mismanagement of crises. Twitter still has that option if Trump continues to use Twitter to endanger innocent people \u2013 which he surely will.</p> <p>If Trump could not tweet, we might all be better able to focus. His eruptions would have to occur live, in front of reporters and viewers, so they could be contextualized and mitigated. But that\u2019s not in the immediate interest of Twitter. The blowback against Twitter and its innocent employees would be fierce and probably violent.</p> <p>Earlier in the week Twitter affixed a useless \u201cfact check\u201d tag to two of Trump\u2019s tweets about postal voting.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump essentially commanded his militia of supporters to flood the employee with death threats. That\u2019s exactly what happened</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This sent Trump into a rage. It spurred him to issue a silly \u201cexecutive order\u201d that demonstrated that no one in the White House seems to understand the very Twitter-shielding law Trump was criticising or the fact that the executive branch of government has no say over that law.&nbsp;</p> <p>While the \u201cexecutive order\u201d was harmless and comical, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21272210/trump-twitter-fact-check-admin-targeting-employee-voter-fraud-controversy\">Trump also unleashed a barrage of terror</a> on to an innocent employee of Twitter. After the New York Post and then Fox News revealed that this employee had participated in the decision to affix the \u201cfact check\u201d label to the tweets, Trump named him in a tweet. By doing so Trump essentially commanded his militia of supporters to flood the employee with death threats. That\u2019s exactly what happened.&nbsp;</p> <p>This sort of behavior has been a constant tactic of authoritarian nationalists like Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India. <a href=\"https://thewire.in/politics/narendra-modi-twitter-trolls-free-expression\">Modi\u2019s political supporters are known to flood</a> journalists and critics of the government with life-upending threats and even actual violence and murder. Modi uses Twitter, Facebook and WhatApp to execute his campaigns of terror. Trump has learned well from Modi. Despite all the pain they sparked for the Twitter employee, the \u201cfact checks\u201d did nothing to help anyone. No one is likely to click on the tiny link to read further information about postal voting. The fact that Trump reacted became the much bigger story, thus defeating the purpose of the \u201cfact check\u201d. It taught no one anything and did not impede the spread of misinformation.&nbsp;</p> <p>The later move, however, is much more effective and appropriate. The standard for such content moderation should be the potential for harm rather than the truth or falsity of the claims. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/02/opinion/facebook-zuckerberg-political-ads.html\">Determining the \u201ctruth\u201d of a tweet is folly.</a> Judging \u201ctruth\u201d itself is hardly something the staff at Twitter should or could do. \u201cTruth\u201d is not the real issue or the problem.</p> <p>Right now Twitter, Facebook and YouTube are leveraged to flood our collective consciousness with stimuli. The specific nature of the stimuli matters less than the overall experience of them. We are living in a cacophony of crap. When someone powerful wishes harm on others, the standard is easier to judge and much more urgent.&nbsp;</p> <p>Hours after Twitter covered Trump\u2019s tweet, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1266342941649506304?s=20\">the official White House account quoted the tweet in its entirety</a>, escaping Twitter\u2019s efforts. Twitter has done nothing to change how it presents the thousands of earlier dangerous tweets from Trump. And everything Trump tweets ends up on Facebook, which has seven times the number of American users that Twitter does. So this all could be futile anyway.</p> <p>There is no way Twitter can scale up this policy to cover every violent world leader, let alone the 330m Twitter accounts around the world. So we should not expect this practice to \u201cfix\u201d Twitter and make it a more useful and less destructive force in the world. People will still get hurt because Twitter remains fundamentally ungovernable. But slowing down Trump\u2019s calls for violence is the right move for Twitter. It just happens to be the right move for the rest of us as well.</p> <p>Companies should do what is best for themselves, their workers, customers, users and shareholders. There is no reason to expect companies to care about anything so vague and contradictory as the \u201cpublic interest\u201d. They have no incentive to do so. But a company like Twitter has a long-term interest in making the experience of Twitter as pleasant and untroubling as possible for users and advertisers. That\u2019s why content moderation matters.</p> <p>Twitter has never stood up for the interests of Twitter users over Trump before. It has bent to Trump\u2019s will time and time again. This move demonstrates that Twitter has learned a few things, albeit at least three years too late.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><p>Siva Vaidhyanathan is a regular columnist for the Guardian, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia, and the author of Antisocial Media: How Facebook Disconnects Us and Undermines Democracy.</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Tensions among protesters in Detroit have broken out contrasting largely peaceful gatherings during the day with violent unrest at night as the city is among many across the US dealing with seething anger at the death of African American George Floyd at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer.</p> <p>Some activists in the city have contrasted the fiery speeches but peaceful marches led by local black organizers with a violent turn of events after dark when a majority-white group of protesters have clashed with police, especially on Friday night.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/minneapolis-protests-george-floyd-outsiders-looting\">The governor says Minneapolis is 'under assault'. Who is behind the protests?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The violence has created tension with some black residents in Detroit, a city that is more than 80% African American, some of whom view the clashes and vandalism as the work of white outsiders.&nbsp;</p> <p>Police say the majority of the 60 people arrested on Friday night were not Detroit residents. Protesters threw rocks and glass bottles at police and vandalized several squad cars. In response, officers in riot gear swarmed protesters and fired teargas canisters. By the night\u2019s end, one protester was killed in a drive-by shooting, while dozens of protesters and officers were injured in the fights.&nbsp;</p> <p>The march\u2019s organizers, Metro Detroit Political Action Network\u2019s Meeko Williams and JoAnna Underwood, expressed frustration with the turn of the events, and stressed that black people in the city \u201chave to deal with the fallout later\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWhen you have provocateurs, outside folks who are egging things on, throwing bricks \u2013&nbsp;I don\u2019t deal with that,\u201d Williams said. \u201cFlat-out respect our city and our city will respect you.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>The situation in Detroit isn\u2019t unique. Black leaders in several cities hit by the ongoing unrest have questioned the role of white protesters who they charge have in some cases co-opted protests and put African Americans in danger. In Oakland, Cat Brooks, co-founder of the Anti Police-Terror Project, wrote on Twitter: \u201cWhite people DONT get to use Black pain to justify living out your riot fantasies.\u201d&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2b26a974b67adcd1cd5165cc3d38f0e15b1c43cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b26a974b67adcd1cd5165cc3d38f0e15b1c43cf/0_0_5106_4160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters raise their fists as they kneel in front of a police station in Detroit, Michigan, on Saturday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"815\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters raise their fists as they kneel in front of a police station in Detroit, Michigan, on Saturday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seth Herald/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brooks told the Guardian she was not against property destruction, but said she was worried about \u201cblack and brown bodies that get funneled into jails based on white people\u2019s actions.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIf a black person decides \u2018I\u2019m going to set this building on fire\u2019 \u2026&nbsp;it\u2019s self-determination,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want a black person to be threatened with arrest over a riot because some white people decided to do whatever the fuck they wanted.\u201d</p> <p>The tension is generating a discussion on how white protesters can show solidarity with African Americans. Brooks said black protesters \u201cneed allyship, not leadership.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI need white people to ask black and brown people what they want them to do, then do that,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t come with your own agendas \u2013 this isn\u2019t about you, it\u2019s about us.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Williams said those activists he works with in and around Detroit \u201cdon\u2019t condone violence and we\u2019re not a part of any violence.</p> <p>\u201cWe never talk about burning buildings down \u2013&nbsp;we\u2019re more about protecting community and mutual aid,\u201d he added.&nbsp;</p> <p>The conversation, however, is thorny and nuanced, especially as some debate police provocation. Detroit police accommodated protesters in several ways \u2013&nbsp;officers passed out masks before the march and \u201callowed us in the street and let us take downtown Detroit\u201d, Williams said.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A lot of people of all races are tired and are reaching their breaking point but to call them all violent would be unfair to a lot of them</p> <footer> <cite>JoAnna Underwood</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But Underwood also noted officers in some cases were \u201crude\u201d and provoked protesters. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joeguillen/status/1266563974658744321?s=20\">Video from the confrontations</a> later in the night appears to show police violently attacking protesters at different points.&nbsp;</p> <p>Underwood also stressed Detroit organizers appreciate \u201cwhite allies\u201d and weren\u2019t accusing everyone who arrived from out of town to march of using the protest as an excuse to fight with police.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people of all races are tired and are reaching their breaking point,\u201d she said, \u201cbut to call them all violent would be unfair to a lot of them.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>While many of those involved in Detroit\u2019s Friday violence were white, some were African American. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarwinBondGraha/status/1266788806553788416?s=20\">Reports</a> and video from other cities show racially mixed groups taking part in vandalism and clashes with police.&nbsp;</p> <p>Williams also asked that all those making their voices heard in Detroit \u201ccontrol their emotions\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe common enemy is violence, not each other, and we have to make sure everyone in metro Detroit heals,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re finally bringing everyone together but we have got to do it right.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It was such a relief, on Monday afternoon, to see that the government had finally sorted out its messaging. Up to then it had been so confused! Stay at home! Go out a bit! Go to the park but don\u2019t sit down! Put on a mask if you\u2019re having a picnic! Stay alert \u2013 the virus may be behind you! Catch the virus at a sustainable rate! Somehow try to do some economic activity! Anything but a podcast!</p> <p>You may not go to your second home! But you may now buy a second home! But you may not now go to it! See your parents one at a time, up to a maximum of four! Do not exercise for more than an hour! If you go to Cumbria you will be killed! Wear adorable homemade masks, not scary medical ones, which are reserved for concealing compassionate smiles from the dying! Clap separately but simultaneously! If you\u2019ve got dementia, remember to take extra care!&nbsp;</p> <p>If you\u2019re anxious to comply with the rules, how can you know that you are? And equally, if you\u2019re anxious not to, how can you know that you aren\u2019t? That\u2019s just as galling. Like a vandal discovering that the wall he\u2019s defacing is actually a specially designated civic space for people to express themselves.</p> <p>But now it\u2019s been sorted! The government has finally twigged that the best way to get through to people at times like these is with drama. Drama has an unmatched power to communicate complexity, and to resolve apparent contradiction, to humanise vast and ungraspable concepts. And that brings me back to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-public-sympathy-boris-johnson-chief-adviser-no-10\">Monday afternoon\u2019s broadcast</a> and the launch of HM Government\u2019s new pandemic-explaining character \u201cDominic Cummings\u201d, star of the new state-sponsored infotainment strand <em>Cummings and Goings</em>.</p> <p>An everyman in the mould of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/jul/16/advertising1\">Hector the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/jul/16/advertising1\">tax </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/jul/16/advertising1\">inspector,</a> Dominic Cummings appears to be the product of CGI rather than Hector\u2019s more conventional cartoon animation, and looks impressively human, albeit slightly sullied by the digital taint of the uncanny valley. His movements, surely the product of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/dec/06/andy-serkis-film-hobbit-king-kong-fungus\">Andy Serkis\u2019s</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/dec/06/andy-serkis-film-hobbit-king-kong-fungus\"> inimitable amphibianesque physicality</a> (thanks Andy for stepping up when your country needs you), were projected on to a verdant garden backdrop and the character then seated himself at a simple table with a glass of water, presumably to allay any subconscious audience concerns that he needs to keep moist.&nbsp;</p> <p>Then we were in for an informative treat! Enough of the hypothetical scenarios, let\u2019s hear about what an everyday decent guy has been doing under his own unique and specific circumstances \u2013 because, in the end, everyone\u2019s circumstances are unique and specific, and guidelines can only ever be that: a guide. And rules can also only ever be that. And laws too. And the lines on a road, just guidelines, lines guiding you wherever you want to go.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the case of Dominic Cummings, that was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/23/dominic-cummings-no-10-accused-of-covering-up-lockdown-breach\">a big phlegmy trip with wife and child</a> up to his parents\u2019 property in Durham. That\u2019s a long way from his home in London, but here is the government finally showing it gets it: not everyone\u2019s family estate is in the Home Counties. Come on \u2013 wake up, media bubble! Some families have to look much further afield to be able to buy a large amount of land. That\u2019s the reality of modern Britain. Hooray that it\u2019s finally being recognised.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Whatever Cummings does, Johnson\u2019s endorsement provides the punchline</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As with a lot of important art, <em>Cummings and Goings</em> is rich with allegory. Durham doesn\u2019t just mean Durham. Durham is an idea, a feeling, a state of mind \u2013 a hope, a plan or a secret. We all have a Durham \u2013 that\u2019s what Cummings is saying \u2013 but it\u2019s probably not literally Durham. His Durham is Durham but your Durham may be Brighton or the outer Hebrides or a pub that still opens on the quiet.</p> <p>And of course we aren\u2019t meant to take literally the idea that Dominic Cummings drove 30 miles to a riverbank at Barnard Castle on his wife\u2019s birthday purely because all the opticians were closed.&nbsp;Nobody would be so stupid as to think that could be fact. Is it fiction then? Assuming so, like all the greatest fiction, it conveys a deeper truth. What is that truth? Well, as both Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have said, people need to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/may/25/boris-johnson-says-people-should-make-up-own-minds-on-dominic-cummings-video\">\u201cmake up their own minds\u201d.</a></p> <p>The nuance and complexity of Cummings as a character is a testament to how much respect our leaders have for us. Not for the British a patronising clear and packaged message, but instead an unvarnished deep, insoluble human truth \u2013 pain, fear, disdain, secrecy, compromise and how scruffy a shirt can look after a comparatively short period of wearing it, all laid bare. This is a massive advance in public communication and I predict Cummings will be bigger than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/25/david-prowse-green-cross-man-darth-vader-children-road-safety\">the Green Cross Code </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/25/david-prowse-green-cross-man-darth-vader-children-road-safety\">Man.</a> We\u2019ll be buying dolls of him \u2013 little nodding ones for the dashboard, implicitly endorsing our every journey.&nbsp;</p> <p>I look forward to Cummings\u2019s future adventures whatever they\u2019ll be. Cummings saying \u201clovely bluebells\u201d when his eyesight goes weird again on the A1(M); Cummings losing his job and starting a podcast; Cummings climbing up a 5G mast to set fire to it, slipping and ending up dangling from his own beanie; Cummings taking his wife and child on a 100mph circuit of Brands Hatch in order to safely check his tyre pressure.</p> <p>And of course, the real stroke of comic genius is how Boris Johnson joins in with the fiction, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_raOZqmxYQ\">like Tony Hart did with </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_raOZqmxYQ\">Mr Bennett.</a> Whatever Cummings does, Johnson\u2019s endorsement provides the punchline. A lesser leader might excuse Cummings by saying he made a mistake but not a very serious one. But Johnson said he \u201cacted responsibly, legally and with integrity\u201d.</p> <p>Not just \u201che is in general a responsible, law-abiding person who has integrity\u201d but on this particular occasion \u2013 the Durham trip under lockdown plus eye test at the national speed limit \u2013 for that bit of his life, Cummings \u201cacted responsibly, legally and with integrity\u201d. Etch that phrase on to the side of a giant aluminium penis, call it \u201cThe Treachery of Words\u201d and you\u2019d have a major contender for the Turner prize.</p>",
  "<p>With increasing desperation, Boris Johnson has urged everyone to \u201cmove on\u201d from talking about Dominic Cummings. The public know what they want. They want the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser moved out.</p> <p>This time last week, Mr Cummings was telling journalists that the revelations about his lockdown-busting excursions to and around Durham were \u201cfake news\u201d, while reassuring the prime minister that this story could not harm them, because it was of interest only to the Westminster bubble. All of which turned out to be as ludicrously wrong as making a 60-mile car trip with your four-year-old strapped in the back as an \u201ceyesight test\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>I have had a ringside seat for many political dramas. Some \u2013 such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/13/black-wednesday-20-years-pound-erm\">Black Wednesday</a>, the poll tax revolt and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/may/11/mps-expenses-best-and-worst\">MPs\u2019 expenses scandal</a> \u2013 have mattered a lot. Others have not mattered a jot. To be a consequential episode with lasting effects, a scandal has to have key attributes. It must cut through to the public in a big way. It must change how the country sees its government. And it must redefine opinions in a way that is enduringly bad.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93da0dc50be644ea7b3bcbe1634068fc319572cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93da0dc50be644ea7b3bcbe1634068fc319572cb/77_93_875_524/500.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Cummings in Downing Street wearing sunglasses and a black T-shirt.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Cummings: \u2018doing the wrong thing\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Chown/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Cummings affair ticks all of those boxes. The cut-through to the public has been immediate, massive and extremely negative. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/30/tory-poll-lead-collapses-as-voters-say-cummings-should-go\">Opinium poll</a> that we publish today finds that four out of five voters think the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser broke the rules, two out of three do not believe his explanations, and a similar proportion think he should go. Support for the government has dropped by eight points, the largest weekly plunge ever recorded by Opinium. Boris Johnson has said \u201cpeople will make up their own minds\u201d. The people have. They think his chief adviser is a rule-breaking liar who should be sacked if he won\u2019t resign.&nbsp;</p> <p>The reasons why they think this could elude only someone who is supposed to be a genius at reading public opinion. Everyone who has had to make sacrifices during this crisis \u2013 and that is many millions of people \u2013 has felt stung by the discovery that it was one rule for them and another for Boris Johnson\u2019s court favourite. Those voters who were still inclined to give the government the benefit of the doubt when it claimed \u201cwe\u2019re all in it together\u201d have been made to feel like credulous dupes.</p> <p>This sense of being taken for mugs was compounded by Mr Cummings\u2019 news conference in the Downing Street rose garden, a venue usually reserved for hosting foreign leaders, not contrition-free sophistry by an unelected apparatchik trying to save his job. He was sounding almost plausible until he made the claim that the 60-mile round trip to a beauty spot on Easter Sunday, which just happened to be his wife\u2019s birthday, was to test whether he was fit to drive. Was that the best that the grand wizards of spin at Number 10 could come up with? What alternative alibis did they discard as too risible before they alighted on that one? Or did he fail to come up with a more credible explanation for the side tour to Barnard Castle because he was too busy <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/cummings-blog-coronavirus/\">rewriting old blogs</a> so he could claim he had warned about a pandemic when he hadn\u2019t? People will put up with a lot from their governments, but being taken for idiots who will fall for anything is not one of them.&nbsp;</p> <p>One of the reveals of this affair \u2013 actually, more of a confirmation than a reveal \u2013 is that the people running Number 10 do take their fellow Britons to be fools.&nbsp;Mr Johnson and Mr Cummings secured their seats of power by manufacturing a \u201cpeople versus the elite\u201d narrative with themselves self-cast as the tribunes of the plebs. This was always counterfeit. Mr Johnson is a Latin-quoting Old Etonian. Mr Cummings\u2019s father-in-law lives in a castle. The chasm between what they claim to be and what they truly are has now been definitively exposed. One Tory MP comments: \u201cPeople are furious. I keep hearing \u2018one rule for us\u2019. It\u2019s doing serious damage.\u201d The prime minister and his chief adviser are now the faces of an out-of-touch, hypocritical, unaccountable, unapologetic, unshamable elite.&nbsp;</p> <p>The effect on public opinion has fomented a ferocious mood in the Conservative parliamentary party. One Tory MP, who has not taken a public position, reports: \u201cI\u2019ve had hundreds of emails \u2013 I\u2019m not exaggerating: hundreds \u2013 about this. Ninety eight per cent of them are hostile.\u201d&nbsp;Quite a lot of Tories think that the events of the past week, indisputably a gift to Labour, have made the next election harder to win.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Boris has just used up one of his lives</p> <footer> <cite>Former cabinet minister</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Around half of Tory backbenchers have been publicly critical of Mr Cummings, with many calling for his resignation. A minister has quit.&nbsp;Many more feel the same way, but have not spoken out for reasons of loyalty or careerism or for fear of retribution by Mr Cummings and his small but powerful gang at Number 10.&nbsp;\u201cLook down the list of those [Tories] who went public with a call for his resignation,\u201d says one senior Conservative. \u201cIt\u2019s not all Remoaners or people he\u2019s picked fights with. It\u2019s all sorts of people. It\u2019s long-standing MPs and it\u2019s new MPs.\u201d</p> <p>So another consequence of this episode is a recasting of the relationship between Number 10 and Conservative MPs. When Boris Johnson won them a parliamentary majority last December, it was said by many, including me, that this would grant him an extraordinary amount of goodwill and forbearance with his backbenchers. A great deal of that capital has just been burnt up in this bonfire of Cummings\u2019 vanities.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIt has hurt Boris,\u201d says one former cabinet minister. \u201cBoris has just used up one of his lives.\u201d</p> <p>Another price has been paid in the degradation of the cabinet. About half of them didn\u2019t come out in public support of Mr Cummings and about half of them did, and I award no prizes for guessing which half has the more self-respect this morning. It was a humiliation for senior ministers to be ordered to tie themselves in knots trying to defend an adviser who is known to hold most of them in contempt. It was demeaning for cabinet members to issue near-identical tweets in his support as if they were no more than fake accounts operated from a bot farm. Given the lack of evidence that all of them are sentient human beings, perhaps some of these ministers are indeed badly written algos run out of Mr Cummings\u2019 laptop. Generously assuming that at least some of them have a latent regard for their own reputations, the ridicule they have endured will leave a bitter taste. Next time Mr Cummings gets himself into trouble \u2013 and there will be a next time \u2013 they may be a little more reluctant to come to his defence.&nbsp;</p> <p>The government has yet to face what could be the most deadly consequence of this episode: what it means for control of the epidemic.&nbsp;How easy will ministers find it to persuade the public to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d when these same ministers have spent the past week defending Mr Cummings for doing the wrong thing? The government is moving deeper into the perilous phase of releasing lockdown measures when it cannot be entirely sure that it truly has the disease suppressed and before a test-and-trace regime has been adequately established.</p> <p>Voicing the anxieties of the scientific advisers, Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief among them, <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/sir-patrick-vallance-says-uk-18327076\">has warned </a>that \u201cwe still have a significant burden of infection\u201d and the UK remains in a \u201cfragile state\u201d.&nbsp;Despite that serious caution, Mr Johnson is rapidly moving towards a substantial dismantling of restrictions. He now does so under a dark cloud of suspicion that his decision-making is no long being driven by the best scientific advice but by a desire to get his rule-breaking adviser out of the headlines. Should there be a reignition of the epidemic, should we face the much-dreaded second wave, the government will find it much harder to convince the country that it acted in good faith and did all in its power to ensure maximum public compliance. This will be even more the case if people break the rules with the excuse that \u201cI\u2019m just following my instincts\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m only doing a Cummings\u201d.</p> <p>Boris Johnson was persuaded that it would look weak to give up his senior aide. The main source of that advice was, no doubt, Mr Cummings himself. Or, it occurs to me, the prime minister may be paralysed by the terror that a sacked Cummings would vengefully spill many rancid secrets.&nbsp;Whichever is the case, it looks both pathetic and dangerous to cling to one unelected adviser at such a severe cost to the government\u2019s authority, the cabinet\u2019s credibility, control of the epidemic, the national interest and even people\u2019s lives. That will not be readily forgotten.</p> <p>\u2022Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",
  "<p>Isabel Killick, an impoverished East End tailoress with three children and a sickly husband, appeared before a House of Lords select committee in 1888 and, on one of the rare occasions in which a working-class woman could speak for herself directly to those in power, she explained that she worked from 6am to 8pm in her home to feed her family by \u201ctrouser finishing\u201d .</p> <p>Her own daily diet was a cup of tea and a herring, \u201cas for meat, I do not expect; I get meat once in six months\u201d. Killick was one of 4 million girls and women in paid work in Victorian Britain \u2013 15% of whom were mothers. As historian Helen McCarthy explains in <em>Double Lives: A History of Working Motherhood</em>, such women were a well-established feature but were considered a deviancy, far from the social norm.</p> <p>Generalisations often abound in chronicles of women\u2019s conditions because the rich diversity of women\u2019s lives within and between classes were either unrecorded or mediated through the views of the male upper class and middle-class females, social investigators. For instance, the sweated industries exhibition in 1906 was intended to show the plight of 450,000 homeworkers, who were often assisted by their tiny children. Visitors paid a shilling to view photographs and living exhibits with \u201ctired faces and broken bodies\u201d working in occupations that included making baby bonnets and industrial tools, chocolate boxes, artificial flowers and matchboxes. McCarthy writes: \u201cAs so often the case when the rich and comfortably off interpreted the lives of the poor the degradation of the nameless women (and men) on show \u2026 was deduced not by listening to voices but by observing bodies \u2026 testimony to hopeless defeated lives.\u201d</p> <p>McCarthy\u2019s triumph lies in listening to many voices, revealing a complexity and richness that challenges the simple narrative that the working-class female has always needed to work for survival, the educated woman wants employment as a legitimate aspiration, while the male establishment and censorious nosy parkers don\u2019t like either.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0488a5f247c2a3ab8084cd05b0780d6d20ea10d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0488a5f247c2a3ab8084cd05b0780d6d20ea10d1/0_289_3461_2076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The social reformer, historian and economist Beatrice Webb.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The social reformer, historian and economist Beatrice Webb.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Double Lives</em> is a milestone in women\u2019s history precisely because McCarthy persists in unpicking the contradictions, in understanding that women\u2019s own feelings and desires, not just social convention and economic necessity, were and are \u201ccrucial to the reimagining of motherhood\u201d and a life outside the tight girdle of domesticity. Let\u2019s hope that, in lockdown, the diversity of experiences of mothers, many coping with paid work, childcare and managing households under siege, is as well recorded and understood by future historians.</p> <p>So we hear the voice of childless campaigner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/mar/04/history.politics\">Beatrice Webb</a>, enamoured with \u201cthe holiness of motherhood\u201d, castigating a homeworker as \u201can enemy to her sex\u201d and feminist trade unionist Clementina Black instructing a committee of MPs that a box to send wedding cake through the post required 15 operations to assemble. \u201cThat box,\u201d she said, \u201cwas made in a very grubby house but by a very clever woman.\u201d</p> <p>While again, contrary to the stereotypes, some homeworkers were judged to be \u201crespectable\u201d, and \u201cwell-dressed\u201d, flourishing enough to employ apprentices. One working mother told Black: \u201cA shilling of your own is worth two that he gives you.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Women are still unlawfully sacked in pregnancy; still predominantly earn less than men</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><em>Double Lives</em> seeks to discover why legislation that was supposed to end discrimination, abolish unequal pay and permit flexible working without forfeiting a career has not eased the situation of the two-thirds of women who are mothers in paid work now. Women are still unlawfully sacked in pregnancy; still predominantly earn less than men; still carry the major burden of domesticity and employment; still carry the major blame for children\u2019s mental ill-health because they are \u201cabsent\u201d.</p> <p>Changes have come. Women are no longer only valued for their reproductive abilities, as \u201cnurturers\u201d of the race, but what\u2019s missing is the radical systemic overhaul required \u2013 for example for affordable, good quality childcare. Society\u2019s attitudes remain conflicted. Too often \u201cgood\u201d mothers work part-time (or not at all) and compromise their chosen careers, while \u201cbad\u201d mothers are seen to behave like alpha males.</p> <p>McCarthy says she is \u201cwhite, middle class, highly educated and well paid\u201d. Her inclusion of black and ethnic minority mothers who work skims the surface and she says others will investigate working mothers in same-sex relationships, those with disabilities, and trans-parenting. What she does very well is chart how \u201cwomen\u2019s worlds were shaped by a labour market founded on sexual difference, a welfare state which institutionalised the dependency of wives and a wider culture which prized devoted mothering and housewifery as the apotheosis of femininity\u201d.</p> <p>The watershed for working mothers was not so much the feminist battles fought again and again, McCarthy argues, but, in the 1950s, the impact of consumerism, rising wages and mass employment. Women brought in the \u201cextra\u201d for washing machines, a family holiday, DIY. \u201cThe moral distinction once tightly drawn between mothers who \u2018needed\u2019 to work and those who merely wanted to broke down,\u201d she writes. \u201cA second income in the family became a mark of prosperity rather than a source of shame.\u201d</p> <p>Before that tidal change, two world wars had allowed women to step into men\u2019s skilled employment. A domestic skivvy on 15 shillings a week could earn four times as much working in munitions. After each war, the trade unions ensured the men retrieved their jobs, and that women\u2019s pay packets and skills were reduced. Marriage often meant female employment was barred.</p> <p>Working mothers in all their variety continue to wait for equality \u2013 as do fathers wishing to have more involvement with their children. McCarthy\u2019s book eloquently explains why the resistance is still so strong and the roots of the ambivalence towards working mothers runs so deep.

  "<p>\u2018What is truth? said jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an answer.\u201d Francis Bacon may have been the father of the great English empirical tradition \u2013 we arrive at truth by asking questions and assessing evidence \u2013 but when he wrote one of the most quoted lines in the language, he could mock Pilate because in 1625 it was self-evident that Jesus was the son of God.&nbsp;</p> <p>Today we are less certain about God and Jesus, but ever more certain about Bacon\u2019s greater point \u2013 that if we don\u2019t question and test the answers there is no route to truth.</p> <p>However, Bacon\u2019s conception of objective truth has long been under fire. There is no truth; there is your truth and my truth. All facts are mediated through personal experience; as even scientific theories change over time.</p> <p>It\u2019s an attitude that has spilled over into politics and journalism. Time was, when the bulk of the Tory and Labour parties could be trusted to adhere to the notion that there are truths; that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/28/bbc-impartiality-emily-maitliss-owen-jones\">BBC impartiality</a>, for example, could exist. However, politics has become increasingly about the fight to control the <em>narrative</em> which then, in turn, dictates \u201cfacts\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>Thus a Brexiter politician will celebrate leading Britain into global trading relationships based on \u201cWTO\u201d terms even as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/11/uk-post-brexit-trade-at-risk-as-wto-top-court-shuts-down\">WTO collapses</a>. It\u2019s the story that counts, not the truth \u2013 better still if it can be captured, Dominic Cummings-like, in a three-word slogan.&nbsp;</p> <p>It\u2019s a reflex that is fatally on display in the government\u2019s management of the pandemic. Suddenly the issues are not just a party political fight to create a \u201cdominant narrative\u201d, whatever the facts, but are a matter of life and death. The government wants to portray itself as being truth-seeking, driven by \u201cthe science\u201d. But it was not science that justified the fatal weeks-long delay in launching lockdown; it was the prime minister\u2019s own libertarian instincts and accompanying indecision \u2013 looking for a scientific rationale to show mitigation was the better policy.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Covid-19 is creating a watershed moment.

There really are facts; we had better respect them if we want to stay alive. The furore provoked by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/28/bbc-swamped-with-complaints-about-newsnight-intro-on-cummings\">Emily Maitlis</a>, <em>Newsnight</em>\u2019s talented and charismatic lead presenter, and her introduction&nbsp;to the Tuesday night programme spoke to the moment. All the country, she said as she opened her programme, knew that the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser had broken the lockdown rules. People \u201cfeel like fools\u201d for observing the rules when those at the top did not, and they could not understand why Johnson \u201cblindly\u201d supported his adviser.</p> <p>But was she stating the facts \u2013 or framing a narrative to support a particular truth?</p> <p>BBC managers, in receipt of thousands of both complaining and supportive emails and a call from No 10, were in no doubt. A lightening fast official BBC reprimand was issued; but not calling out any particular mistake. Maitlis volunteered for a night off, which was quickly portrayed by some as her de facto one-programme suspension.&nbsp;</p> <p>Were BBC managers right? In a battle for the narratives, her introduction certainly challenged the government\u2019s \u2013 but it was actually supported by facts aplenty. Impartiality is about asking questions in search of truth, a value the BBC must hold to the last if it is to survive, and one that needs to be expressed both on and off air. The BBC management\u2019s first instinct when under fire should have been to adopt the same judicious questioning of Maitlis off air that it expects of its presenters on air. They should have worked out a shared response based around shared values and should have done so in their own time, rather than the government\u2019s.</p> <p>This was certainly the way it worked in the 1980s when I was <em>Newsnight</em>\u2019s economics editor. I could trust that the BBC\u2019s first instinct would be my defence, and that I would be involved in the case made in reply to any complaints, from whatever quarter they came. Everything would turn not on a narrative but on whether the facts supported what I reported.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Too little attempt was made to defend Maitlis. The BBC moved, within hours, to concede that she had overstepped the mark</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What is wrong about where the BBC has now landed is that too little attempt was made to defend Maitlis, involve her, or create a joint position as the BBC tried to do in the 1980s. Instead it moved, within hours, to concede that Maitlis had overstepped the mark, presumably in being a \u201cnarrative creator\u201d, without explicitly identifying what error of fact Maitlis had made. Yes, it was a tonally tough framing of the programme, and parts could have been better cast in terms of questions that needed answering, but it was framed by objective fact.</p> <p>The bigger political reality is that this was Cummings and a government baying for the BBC\u2019s head \u2013 appeasement was the order of the day. If the BBC felt that Maitlis had moved into editorialising, it needed to set that out baldly and factually. Instead, she was turned into a victim overnight, creating just the diversionary story for which Downing Street will have hoped. And, by requesting not to present, she too got sucked into No 10\u2019s game.</p> <p>The reaction was painful. The BBC, hitherto enjoying growing ratings with reports that its audience could trust, was on the back foot. Maitlis may have pushed the envelope but, substantially, she was right. We want facts. We want facts on virus testing, facts on whether there was a protective ring around care homes, facts on whether the testing capacity will work and any new app will not transgress basic human rights. There are no \u201cmy truths\u201d and no \u201cyour truths\u201d.</p> <p>Trust can only be earned in public health policy by testing answers. Evidence bending in order to justify a political position is not going to work. One of the reasons Keir Starmer\u2019s approval rating is rising is that he is in step with the times. The period of British politics in which style and storytelling triumphed over fact and evidence is ending. The tragedy is that it has taken a first-order health crisis to remind the British of the tradition that Francis Bacon pioneered \u2013 and once again to live by it.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022Will Hutton is an Observer columnist</p>",

  "<p>Ministers have been accused of creating a \u201cfalse sense of security\u201d by launching a test and trace system that is not yet capable of controlling local outbreaks.</p> <p>A series of concerns have been raised over the gaps in the system launched last week, with local health chiefs warning that they have not been given the time, powers or data to prepare for outbreaks in their area. They said that they were given details of their roles just four working days before Matt Hancock, the health secretary, launched test and trace last week.</p> <p>Boris Johnson said a \u201cworld-beating\u201d operation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/20/boris-johnson-pledges-england-wide-coronavirus-tracing-by-1-june\">would be in place by June</a>. However, those involved in ongoing attempts to set up a system to target local outbreaks told the <em>Observer</em> that launching too soon risked giving the wrong message to the public. They said a comprehensive system was weeks away. \u201cDoing it all too early risks giving people a false sense of security,\u201d said one senior local government figure.</p> <p>City leaders say they have not been given the powers to enforce local lockdowns, while they fear low-income workers have not been given the financial support to self-isolate when instructed to do so. Delays in test results, the absence of an app and the problem of people ignoring lockdown rules after the Dominic Cummings affair have also been raised. \u201cEverybody\u2019s going to very quickly throw that back at you,\u201d one council boss said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"598a8fed56d9a68a661e7026517092c62bfd8973\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/598a8fed56d9a68a661e7026517092c62bfd8973/374_132_2394_1437/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Test and Trace\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samples are taken at a coronavirus testing facility at a park and ride in Leeds last week, as NHS test and trace is rolled out across England.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Local authorities are drawing up tailored proposals to snuff out any outbreaks in settings such as schools, care homes, factories and hostels. However, in many cases the plans are weeks away from completion, while extra resources may yet be needed. A \u00a3300m fund to help the local plans is being handed out from this week. \u201cPromises have been made to the general public about there being a test and trace operation at the moment when it\u2019s really only a skeleton service,\u201d said one council leader.</p> <p>However, Whitehall insiders insisted that the government had been talking to local government for months about the pandemic, and that councils already had pandemic plans they could draw upon. They also said that the powers for local lockdowns lay with the central government, which would use them if needed.</p> <p>Judith Blake, leader of Leeds city council, said: \u201cThe government still hasn\u2019t adequately addressed the need to make sure that everyone has the financial ability to self-isolate, should they be contacted and asked to do so.\u201d</p> <p>Nick Rushton, leader of Tory-run Leicestershire county council,&nbsp;said councils needed more powers. \u201cIf they want us to politically lead it, they\u2019ve got to give some political leadership powers,\u201d he said. Richard Watts, leader of Islington council in London, said: \u201cThe government needs to be completely frank and honest with people about how much of this system is actually working in reality.

One retired nurse said that throughout the first shifts on Thursday and Friday no cases reached her screen. Another tracer told the <em>Observer</em> her three-minute interview for the job included asking her if she owned a computer: \u201cIt was obvious [in training] that some of the people were not capable of doing this simple job. The trainer would often respond to questions with \u2018I don\u2019t know, I only started this job yesterday myself.\u2019\u201d She tried to quit, but had no line manager to give her resignation to.</p> <p>The website the tracers use crashed on launch day. Some complained they couldn\u2019t log in. Others felt they\u2019d had too little training to deal with the sensitive matter of informing someone they might have a life-threatening disease. And plenty have asked why the launch date was arbitrarily brought forward \u2013 with just a few hours\u2019 notice \u2013 from 1 June to last Thursday, the day after Cummings was ruled by Durham police to have potentially broken the lockdown rules.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK doesn\u2019t have a world-beating covid test and trace system in place,\u201d said Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers. \u201cThere has been recent progress but we\u2019re a long way behind South Korea, Australia and Germany \u2013 we\u2019re mid-table at best. We should have been thinking about testing and tracing from the very beginning.</p> <p>\u201cIt was only in early May that a proper plan started to take shape. Setting up a test and trace system in a few weeks was always going to be impossible, although the central government team led by Dido Harding are working effectively at high speed.\u201d</p> <p>Harding, the former TalkTalk chief executive, and her team created a plan to hire 7,000 doctors and nurses to be \u201ctier 2\u201d clinical contact tracers, collecting lists of contacts. The lists would be passed on to 18,000 lay \u201ctier 3\u201d contact tracers, who would speak to those who may have contracted the disease. The hardest cases would be reserved for \u201ctier 1\u201d tracers \u2013 the seasoned Public Health England (PHE) local authority contact tracers.</p> <p>Professor Sir Chris Ham, the former chief executive of health thinktank the King\u2019s Fund, said Harding inherited a badly designed system, with testing run by the Department of Health and contact tracing by PHE. \u201cTesting and tracing have to go hand in hand. The original intention was to be run centrally without involving public health directors and councils whose local knowledge and experience intelligence is absolutely vital. That amazes mey.\u201d</p> <p>The department of health and social care said: \u201cWe have successfully launched NHS Test and Trace to help us keep this virus under control and save lives, while carefully and safely lifting the lockdown nationally. All local councils already have plans in place to respond to Covid-19. To support the rollout of NHS Test and Trace, we asked every council to extend their existing plans into dedicated local outbreak plans by the end of June.</p> <p>\u201cLast week we gave \u00a3300m new, dedicated funding to support councils to do all they can to make Test and Trace a success.\u201d</p>",

Parliament is resuming on Tuesday with the row still unresolved.</p> <p>One former cabinet minister predicted \u201ctotal chaos\u201d if leader of the house <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/20/mps-fear-two-tier-commons-if-lockdown-lifted-in-uk-parliament\">Jacob Rees-Mogg</a> presses ahead with the plan and insists on a policy of \u201cphysical voting\u201d only in the chamber. Many MPs say the rules will mean they have to break the law by travelling to parliament and staying overnight in shared accommodation when they could easily work from home.</p> <p>On Friday evening, the all-party House of Commons procedure committee recommended that the remote voting system should be allowed to continue, to protect the ability of MPs who are self-isolating, shielding, or otherwise vulnerable to represent constituents.</p> <p>The Tory chair of the committee, Karen Bradley, said members would effectively be \u201cdisenfranchised\u201d if the hybrid system was abandoned. On the issue of voting, the committee recommended that&nbsp;\u201cthe house will as far as possible allow virtual participation&nbsp;in its proceedings by members who, by virtue of the&nbsp;coronavirus pandemic, are prevented from attending the house in person\u201d.</p> <p>A Commons vote on how to proceed will be held on Tuesday, with many MPs now torn over whether to attend.</p> <p>Under the Rees-Mogg plan, MPs would have to queue around the palace of Westminster to vote because doing so in the cramped lobbies has been declared unsafe. Former shadow leader of the house Chris Bryant said the queues \u201cwould be like Alton Towers\u201d.</p> <p>Some MPs believe Rees-Mogg wants to recall parliament in full physical form to bolster prime minister Boris Johnson, who prefers a loud group of Tory MPs to be cheering him on. But any hope of a full chamber returning was thwarted when the speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, insisted on retaining a rule that a maximum of only 50 MPs could be in the chamber at any one time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e66e2975a111b810e8b99573844620f96afbe766\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e66e2975a111b810e8b99573844620f96afbe766/99_77_3312_1988/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson during Prime Minister\u2019s Questions in the House of Commons\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson during Prime Minister\u2019s Questions in the House of Commons this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Veteran Labour MP and former minister Margaret Hodge, 75, said she had been told by lawyers that the government would be breaking several laws passed by parliament if it denied MPs the right to vote.</p> <p>\u201cI regard myself as fairly fit but even so I feel absolutely furious that MPs who cannot go to parliament are being discriminated against and denied the right to vote on behalf of our constituents in parliament.</p> <p>\u201cThe informal legal advice I have had suggests that acting in this way would break three different types of legislation regarding healthy and safety, equalities and human rights. It beggars belief that we think we can be above the laws we make.\u201d</p> <p>Former Labour foreign secretary Margaret Beckett, 77, whose husband Leo is 93, said she believed the \u201chybrid\u201d system used earlier this month \u2013 under which MPs could vote either in person when attending parliament or remotely from home \u2013 had worked well. Insisting that MPs return to Westminster to debate and vote would, she said, go against the national guidance on coronavirus and could put MPs\u2019 health and that of their families at risk.</p> <p>\u201cI thought the guidance was that if you could work from home you should do so. I think what they are doing is a very high-risk strategy,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Other MPs with constituencies outside London and the south-east are complaining that forcing them back to Westminster will mean they will have no option but to move back into houses and flats they share with other MPs in London when they are attending parliament.</p> <p>The Labour MP for Manchester Central, Lucy Powell, said: \u201cThe parliamentary estate can adapt like other workplaces, albeit with challenges. However, what contravenes government rules is that most of us would need to stay in our second homes, which many of us share with other MPs, so mixing households and travelling hundreds of miles to get there. We can\u2019t enforce rules that as lawmakers we are breaking ourselves. This will send a very confused message to the public.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>What next in Beijing\u2019s master plan for China\u2019s global advancement?

Instead Li\u2019s focus in the 90-minute event was much more that of a nerdy economic policymaker. In the kind of minute detail redolent of the boss of a small provincial city, the premier listed an array of support measures for the economy: tax cuts for small business, reforms to medical and unemployment insurance, and support for the gig economy.</p> <p>The reason for Li\u2019s focus was obvious. China might have been the first major country out of (as it was the first into) the Covid-19 crisis, but its economy suffered a brutal contraction along the way, leaving a jobless rate of about 20%.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d3a49c64ab6a9b5eae5f68346556d9f20e28287\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d3a49c64ab6a9b5eae5f68346556d9f20e28287/424_245_4387_2633/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Li Keqiang gives a video press conference\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Li Keqiang gives a video press conference after the closing of the third session of the 13th National People\u2019s Congress on 28 May 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: China News Service/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The premier\u2019s annual press conference, held at the end of the annual session of the National People\u2019s Congress, China\u2019s legislature \u2013 delayed by nearly three months because of the virus \u2013 is a keenly watched event, at home and abroad. There were no questions on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/uighurs\">Uighurs</a> or re-education camps in Xinjiang, China\u2019s recent border clashes with India, its trade war with Australia or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/27/huawei-meng-wanzhou-canada-court-ruling-us-extradition\">detention of a Huawei executive in Canada</a>, issues the government didn\u2019t want to air. Likewise, the queries on the economy, the origins of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/10-days-battle-wuhan-covid-19-testing-plan\">Covid-19 in Wuhan</a>, deteriorating relations with Washington, and the new Hong Kong security law were all softballs for Li, who is effectively Xi Jinping\u2019s deputy.&nbsp;</p> <p>But even if <a href=\"https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1783859.shtml\">the questions </a>from foreign and local reporters are cleared by the government beforehand, it is still the only moment in each calendar year in which a top leader appears at length in public and has to state the government\u2019s case. The focus on the economy, then, was telling. For a ruling party that has built legitimacy on near continuous high-speed growth since the late 1970s, the current downturn is a bracing moment. Tens and perhaps hundreds of millions have lost jobs. Those still in employment have had incomes sharply reduced, cutting into consumption. With the US, Europe and Japan in deep recessions, exports cannot take up the slack.</p> <p>To be sure, Beijing has not let its regional and global ambitions lie fallow during Covid-19 and its aftermath, with navy patrols in the South China Sea and the airforce sorties around Taiwan both continuing. And in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hong-kong\">Hong Kong</a>, the most volatile issue on China\u2019s plate, the city\u2019s democrats have been placed firmly in the party\u2019s sights.</p> <p>With the passage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/china-vote-npc-national-security-laws-hong-kong-us-protest\">a new national security law</a> by the NPC last week, China is making a big bet that it can stamp out its political opponents in the former British colony without killing off its vital role as a financial centre. The bill\u2019s vaguely worded offences, outlawing subversion, secessionist sentiment and foreign interference, will be interpreted widely, as they are in China itself, to round up any critics Beijing wants to target.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b59b4b860fa111ad3a64b9a3c80a4349227d6e75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b59b4b860fa111ad3a64b9a3c80a4349227d6e75/752_36_2248_2810/800.jpg\" alt=\"A demonstrator holds up a British national (overseas) passport in front of a Hong Kong colonial flag in shopping mall\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protester holds up a British national (overseas) passport in front of a Hong Kong colonial flag in a shopping mall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kin Cheung/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/uk-will-extend-visas-for-300000-hong-kong-residents-says-raab\">The UK\u2019s suggestion</a> that it would offer a path to citizenship for Hong Kong holders of British national (overseas) passports wanting to leave the territory prompted a sardonic thumbs-up in Beijing. \u201cThe potential UK move has won overwhelming support from Chinese internet users,\u201d said the <em>Global Times</em>, the party\u2019s tabloid attack dog. \u201c[They] said all traitors should be sent to the UK as they are unwanted on Chinese territory.\u201d</p> <p>But no one in Hong Kong thinks the fight will be over quickly, especially as Beijing\u2019s plan for its takeover of the territory\u2019s political system, and opposition to it, is so comprehensive.</p> <p>\u201cThey will send down cadres from the Chinese Communist party to supervise the government, the executive, the legislature, and more importantly, the judiciary. This is only the beginning, I tell you,\u201d Martin Lee, the barrister and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/i-wont-allow-this-to-be-the-end-of-hong-kong-campaigner-on-his-long-fight-for-democracy\">veteran democrat leader</a> said on Friday.</p> <p>In his press conference, Li offered only platitudes on the US relationship but said enough to confirm that bilateral ties between the two superpowers, one rising, the other in relative decline, will not get better soon. There is no off ramp for the US and China for the moment, as it is clear that neither country is looking for one. Washington feels it is playing catch up in muscling up to Beijing, a debate that will only be sharpened in a presidential election year. And China under Xi is programmed not to take a backward step.</p> <p>It is possible that the weakness in both countries\u2019 economies could temper their hardline positions this year, because neither wants to hurt growth any more than it has been already by Covid-19. Equally, Donald Trump might slap new sanctions on China at any time in a heated election campaign, to reinforce his narrative that he has been uniquely tough on China and that Joe Biden, his expected Democratic challenger, by comparison, will be weak. Beijing has made sure to retaliate against any economic sanctions imposed by Trump so far. It is an open question as to whether their calculation will change in an election year.</p> <p>One standout from Li\u2019s appearance before the media was his focus on the importance of the private sector to China\u2019s economic recovery. Xi\u2019s support for the state sector, and his lip service to the private economy, which drives Chinese growth and employment, has alienated many of the country\u2019s entrepreneurs. A number of wealthy business leaders who crossed Xi have been jailed. But Li, who has been overshadowed in office by Xi, took a different line, though whether support for the private sector can be sustained in a grim political climate, however, remains to be seen. Xi will not tolerate any rivals, especially in the form of rich entrepreneurs.</p> <p>\u2022 Richard McGregor is a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney and is the author of numerous books on Chinese politics and foreign policy</p>",

  "<p>The epidemic spread with startling speed. It appeared first in London and within weeks had swept Britain. Thousands died of respiratory illness, the prime minister was laid low, and employees\u2019 sickness disrupted industry and transport.&nbsp;</p> <p>It sounds familiar. Yet this epidemic erupted in 1891 when waves of disease swept round the globe, eventually killing more than a million people. The outbreak was later attributed to flu and dubbed the Great Russian Flu pandemic.</p> <p>However, a group of Belgian scientists has since argued that the pandemic was caused by a different agent: a coronavirus. \u201cIt\u2019s a very convincing analysis,\u201d Dr David Matthews, a coronavirus expert at Bristol University, told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cThe scientists used very sophisticated, advanced research and their claim is worth taking seriously.\u201d</p> <p>The study was led by Belgian biologist Leen Vijgen and her team\u2019s results were published in the <em>Journal of Virology </em>several years ago. Their work, which has re-emerged with the appearance of Covid-19, suggests the coronavirus linked to the 1890 outbreak is likely to have leapt from cows to humans <a href=\"https://jvi.asm.org/content/79/3/1595\">before spreading </a><a href=\"https://jvi.asm.org/content/79/3/1595\">worldwide</a><a href=\"https://jvi.asm.org/content/79/3/1595\">. </a><a href=\"https://jvi.asm.org/content/79/3/1595\">In the case of Covid-19, it is thought bats</a> were the source of the virus.</p> <p>The Vijgen argument is based on the <a href=\"https://jvi.asm.org/content/79/3/1595\">close genetic match</a> between the human coronavirus OC43, a frequent cause of the common cold, and another coronavirus that infects cows. By studying mutation rates in the two viruses, researchers concluded they probably shared a common ancestor from around 1890, indicating the virus jumped from cows to humans at that time. Thus, that year\u2019s epidemic \u201cmay have been the result of interspecies transmission of bovine coronaviruses to humans,\u201d the researchers say.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many 1890 patients suffered central nervous system damage \u2013 rare in influenza but common in today's Covid-19 pandemic</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This link was suggested in 2005 -&nbsp;making the researchers look extraordinarily prescient. \u201cThis is a very careful piece of work,\u201d said Matthews.&nbsp;</p> <p>Observers have pointed out that many 1890 patients suffered central nervous system damage \u2013 a relatively rare symptom for influenza but common in the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>Another striking feature of the 1890 disease was the observation that men were far more vulnerable than women, another feature shared with Covid-19. At the time, one senior doctor recalled how he had been astonished to arrive at morning surgery in January 1890 to find more than 1,000 patients \u2013 the majority of them men \u2013 clamouring for treatment.</p> <p>Humanity has had time to live with OC43 which today only causes relatively mild illnesses. By contrast the 1890 pandemic \u2013 like Covid-19 today \u2013 had a dreadful initial impact. The first cases were reported in late December 1889 and thousands of people died over the next six weeks. Courts were closed, several senior politicians became seriously ill, including Lord Salisbury, the prime minister, while telegraph and railway operations were disrupted when large numbers of workers fell ill.</p> <p>The most famous victim was Prince Albert Victor, Queen Victoria\u2019s grandson. Prince Eddy, as he was popularly known, contracted the disease during a New Year\u2019s shooting party and on 14 January, after five days with pneumonia, he died aged 28. He was second in line to the throne and his death changed the line of succession. The Queen\u2019s grandfather George, Albert\u2019s younger brother, was crowned instead.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"37a251b1c9771f9076907629798c440c4fc98b5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37a251b1c9771f9076907629798c440c4fc98b5b/0_0_3337_4795/696.jpg\" alt=\"Le Petit Parisien, dated 12 January 1890.\" width=\"696\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Le Petit Parisien</em> dated 12 January 1890 focused on the the impact of the epidemic in Paris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The National Library of Medicine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the time the cause of the epidemic sparked serious medical divisions. The existence of a virus \u2013 an entity so tiny it would have been invisible even through a microscope \u2013 had yet to be established by scientists, and&nbsp;epidemiological thinking was dominated by miasma theory. This claimed that&nbsp;weather or fluctuations in the upper atmosphere created toxic air that poisoned humans.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, such theories could not explain why isolated communities such as lighthouses, jails and monasteries, which were presumably exposed to the same occult influences, escaped the epidemic or why the influenza appeared to attack cities and densely populated urban centres close to railways and roads before spreading to rural areas,\u201d notes medical historian Mark Honigsbaum.</p> <p>The initial 1890 outbreak subsided after six weeks. However, the disease returned the next year and caused nearly twice as many deaths and also reappeared in 1892. The Registrar General calculated the death toll in 1890 as 27,000, in 1891 as 58,000 and in 1892 as 25,000.</p> <p>These second and third waves are worrying given that we are still in the first outbreak of Covid-19. Honigsbaum expresses caution, however. \u201cThe claim that the \u2018Russian influenza\u2019 pandemic could have been due to a coronavirus is intriguing, if speculative. Certainly, one of the pandemic\u2019s key features was the way it attacked the nervous system, sparking remarkable cases of depression, psychosis and insomnia.\u201d One notable victim was another prime minister, Lord Rosebery, who was laid up for six weeks in 1895 with a crippling fatigue.</p> <p>\u201cThere were also frequent relapses,\u201d adds Honigsbaum. \u201cThese suggest a first attack did not necessarily confer immunity, something scientists suspect may also be true of coronaviruses.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Like many Twitter debates, the war of words that broke out last week between Donald Trump and the social media company may seem inconsequential, even infantile. However, the spat raises important questions about the relationship between the public, technology companies and the state, especially in a polarised America.</p> <p>On Tuesday, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1265838823663075341\">Twitter attached a health warning</a> to two tweets by Donald Trump about postal ballots, urging users to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1265255835124539392\">\u201cget the facts\u201d</a>. Two days later, a furious Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/donald-trump-social-media-executive-order-twitter\">retaliated with an executive</a> order threatening to curtail legal protections for social media companies. Twitter then upped the stakes by labelling a later Trump tweet about the Minneapolis riots as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1266231100780744704\">\u201cglorifying violence\u201d</a>.</p> <p>At first sight, the issues are straightforward. Twitter did not censor Trump\u2019s tweets, but merely alerted readers to <a href=\"https://pen.org/press-release/trump-lashes-out-against-twitter-fact-check/\">factual or ethical problems</a>. Trump\u2019s executive order, on the other hand, menaced free speech, threatening legal sanctions as retribution. Free speech for Trump seems to mean the right not to be criticised.</p> <p>Behind all this, however, lie deeper questions about the regulation of social media and its role in society. Trump\u2019s executive order targets <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230\">section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act</a>. It\u2019s an obscure piece of US law that is, as the campaigning group Electronic Frontier Foundation observes, \u201cone of the most valuable tools for protecting freedom of expression and innovation on the Internet\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Free speech for Trump seems to mean the right not to be criticised</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Section 230 excludes online platforms from most liabilities for content published by others, while allowing them to provide \u201cgood faith\u201d moderation of users\u2019 comments. Both are crucial not just for Silicon Valley behemoths but for newspapers and bloggers and any online site with which users interact or on which they can post comments.</p> <p>Twitter and Facebook are private companies but also, as the US supreme court has observed, serve as <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1194_08l1.pdf\">\u201cthe modern public square\u201d</a>. This makes them ideal tools for governments to, in the words of Daphne Keller, of Stanford University\u2019s cyber policy centre, <a href=\"https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/research/docs/who-do-you-sue-state-and-platform-hybrid-power-over-online-speech_0.pdf\">\u201claunder state action\u201d</a> \u2013 that is, use them to enforce regulation usually in the state\u2019s domain. European nations are very good at pressing tech giants to \u201cvoluntarily self-regulate\u201d, for instance by censoring speech deemed offensive or controversial.</p> <p>Protections in other countries including in Europe are not as robust as in America. That\u2019s why Section 230 has long been a target for US politicians, both liberal and conservative. The Democrats\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/17/opinion/joe-biden-nytimes-interview.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share\">Joe Biden has gone even further than Trump</a>, calling for section 230 \u201cimmediately [to] be revoked\u201d.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s threat to Twitter is blatant and serves his narrow political ends. But many US politicians want America to be more like European nations, more easily able to use tech companies as proxies for the state. The result will not be to tame Silicon Valley but to disempower the public and constrain its use of the online public square.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The idea that the little people should be scrutinised, but not politicians, leaves a bad taste in the mouth</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Trump\u2019s feud with Twitter also raises questions about how to deal with misinformation. Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg distanced himself from Twitter by suggesting private companies should not be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/28/zuckerberg-facebook-police-online-speech-trump\">\u201carbiters of truth\u201d</a>. Except that Facebook already is. It boasts of \u201cfighting the spread of false news\u201d and ensuring that content declared by fact-checkers to be \u201cfalse\u201d is sanctioned. However, Facebook excludes politicians from its fact checking. The idea that the little people should be scrutinised, but not politicians, leaves a bad taste in the mouth.</p> <p>And yet, Zuckerberg has a point. In a polarised world, fact-checking itself can become a politicised process. As Covid-19 debates reveal, judgments about what is true and whom to trust are not straightforward, even in scientific and medical spheres. Twitter\u2019s fact checking of Trump\u2019s tweet was itself, as the tech magazine <em>Wired</em> observed, misleading. Fact-checkers, <em>Wired</em> pungently noted, \u201care often just as full of shit as the politicians they\u2019re debunking\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s not that lies should not be challenged, nor that there is no such thing as truth, nor yet that we should accept Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway\u2019s insistence that lies are just <a href=\"https://time.com/4642689/kellyanne-conway-sean-spicer-donald-trump-alternative-facts/\">\u201calternative facts\u201d</a>. It is rather that what people accept as \u201ctruth\u201d depends partly on whose authority they are willing to trust. In a political climate in which trust is fractured, so, inevitably, are conceptions of truth and falsity.</p> <p>Debunking lies, and holding politicians to account for their statements, is vital. The challenge we face, however, is primarily political, not factual or technological. That\u2019s why the problem of misinformation seems so difficult to solve \u2013 there are no simple technological or factual fixes to deep-set political conundrums.</p> <p>\u2022Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",
  "<p>Time for a controversial opinion\u2026 While indoor gardening is often considered second fiddle to its outdoor cousin, I think it is superior in pretty much every way. First, it is far more democratic. The vast majority of people have access to a sunny windowsill, but those with substantial outdoor space (and the resources needed to landscape this) are significantly more limited. Secondly, for those living in less idyllic climes, it means you keep growing all year round, even at 10 o\u2019clock on a stormy February evening. It even comes far less encumbered with dusty, cultural baggage of not only the \u201cright\u201d way to do things, but even the \u201cright\u201d way to think about them \u2013 including the idea that indoor horticulture is not \u201creal\u201d gardening.</p> <p>However, there is one aspect of gardening in the great indoors which can put it at an enormous disadvantage: pest and disease control. Perhaps counterintuitively, although living rooms and conservatories provide in many ways a sealed sanctuary, protected from external threats, these very same conditions mean that if a pest hitches a ride on new plant purchases they can quickly reach plague-like proportions. In a stable, warm, indoor climate with an ample food source and no predators, populations of mealy bug, scale insect, red spider mite and thrips can explode, and quickly cripple the health of many plants. This has been made especially likely in recent years as most of the big houseplant growers in the Netherlands, who supply the vast majority of the market, have done a really commendable job improving their environmental footprint by slashing the amount of pesticides they use to essentially zero. When once plants arrived pretty much sterile to store, they now often come with a hitch hiker or two. Sometimes doing the right thing can have its downsides!</p> <p>Fortunately, there is an incredibly simple practice that can dramatically reduce the risk of an outbreak striking your indoor oasis \u2013 and that is proper quarantine. This is standard practice at all the big botanic gardens and commercial growers, and on a domestic scale takes no more than five minutes work. The first step is to carefully inspect any new plants for signs of pests and disease. You don\u2019t have to be an expert to do this, as most have quite easily identifiable tell-tale signs. If new growth is contorted, mottled or yellow, or there is any evidence of tiny bugs or sticky residue on leaves or stems, this is not a good sign. The best time to do this, of course, is before the plants enter your door. So give everything a good once over at the nursery or garden centre before you make your purchase. If in doubt, do not buy them. If you\u2019ve bought online or via mail order, take pictures and contact the supplier straight away.</p> <p>Once in your home, place new arrivals in a separate room from the majority of your collection. For tiny flat dwellers like me, this can be tricky, but even a 6ft distance can make a difference. I like to give them a good spritz with a commercial \u201cplant invigorator\u201d, which contains low doses of safe, mild detergents, which act to physically tackle any potential mini beasts that have missed your checks. Keep the plants there for two weeks, if they have stayed symptom free then they can be set free to mix with the rest of your collection. </p> <p><em>Follow James on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Botanygeek?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@Botanygeek</a></em></p>",
  "<p>Libya\u2019s civil war entered its 7th year this month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/us-says-russia-sent-warplanes-to-back-libyan-warlord\">with no end in sight</a>. In Afghanistan, conflict has raged on and off since the Soviet invasion in 1979. America\u2019s Afghan war is now its longest ever, part of the open-ended US \u201cglobal war on terror\u201d launched after the 2001 al-Qaida attacks.<br><br>Yemen\u2019s conflict is in its sixth pitiless year. In Israel-Palestine, war \u2013 or rather the absence of peace \u2013 has characterised life since 1948. Somalis have endured 40 years of fighting. These are but a few examples in a world where the idea of war without end seems to have become accepted, even normalised.</p> <p>Why do present-day politicians, generals, governments and international organisations appear incapable or uninterested in making peace? In the 19th and 20th centuries, broadly speaking, wars commenced and concluded with formal ultimatums, declarations, agreed protocols, truces, armistices and treaties.</p> <p>Neat and tidy endings, even if sometimes illusory, are rarer these days. According to a survey <a href=\"https://www.iiss.org/press/2020/acs-2020\">published last week</a> by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, 60% of armed conflicts have been active for at least a decade and peace-making prospects globally are in decline.</p> <p>Today\u2019s wars are mostly undeclared, undefined and inglorious affairs typically involving multiple parties, foreign governments, proxy forces, covert methods and novel weapons. They are conducted without regard for civilian lives, the <a href=\"https://www.icrc.org/en/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions\">Geneva conventions</a> regulating armed conflict, or the interests of host populations in whose name they are fought.</p> <p>Great moral crusades, famous causes and genuine ideological struggles are few and far between. Modern wars are mostly about power and treasure. And they go on, and on, and on.</p> <p>Libya is a classic case of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/from-idlib-to-tripoli-turkeys-grab-for-influence-in-libya\">a state of chaos</a> deliberately fed and manipulated by external powers, in this instance Turkey, Qatar, Russia, Egypt and the UAE. Here, as elsewhere, rival rulers claim to be upholding order or fighting \u201cterrorism\u201d while, in reality, they seek to extend national influence and economic advantage. As long as these aims remain unmet, they show scant interest in peace.</p> <p>Ambitious states have always sought to dominate neighbours in the way China, for example, is doing now. One reason this happens more frequently today, and more anarchically, is declining American engagement.</p> <p>In the Middle East and Africa, the US \u2013 no longer a global policeman \u2013 is focused on supporting Israel, squeezing Iran and selling arms, to the exclusion of almost all else. In Asia, it is in retreat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902ongRW5pELIXK/\" data-alt=\"countries with perpetual conflicts\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902ongRW5pELIXK/\">countries with perpetual conflicts</a> </figure>  <p>Donald Trump, desperate for a Nobel peace prize, offered to mediate the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2018/jun/12/trump-and-kim-document-analysis-singapore-agreement-denuclearisation\"> 70-year-old North Korea-South Korea stand-off</a>.

Few take him seriously. Otherwise, his administration has shown zero interest in global conflict resolution.</p> <p>A related factor is the collapse of the western-led consensus favouring multilateral, collaborative approaches to international problems. This is matched by the parallel rise of authoritarian and populist regimes that prioritise narrow national interest over perceptions of the common good.</p> <p>This trend, a regression to the pre-1914 era of competing European nation-states, undermines <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/24/the-observer-view-on-the-failure-to-secure-a-global-ceasefire-during-the-pandemic\">the authority of the UN</a> and cooperative regional platforms such as the EU and African Union. Unsupported, UN peace envoys from Syria to Myanmar and peacekeeping operations across Africa struggle to make headway.</p> <p>Ineffective international law enforcement, symbolised by the inability of the International Criminal Court to deliver justice to war zones such as Iraq and Ukraine, helps freeze or perpetuate conflicts rather than justly resolve them. Demographic and physical causes also contribute to chronic instability.</p> <p>Conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Sahel and Sudan is fuelled by the fact that millions of young men in Africa, where the <a href=\"https://mo.ibrahim.foundation/news/2019/africas-first-challenge-youth-bulge-stuck-waithood\">median age is 19.8</a>, lack fulfilling work or a meaningful stake in their country\u2019s future. Long-running inter-state or intra-state violence is also rooted in the climate crisis and resulting resource scarcity, poverty and dislocation.</p> <p>New technologies and weapons such as drones and cyber warfare are lowering the up-front cost of conflict while enlarging potential theatres of war. Global warming is turning the newly accessible Arctic into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/24/trump-greenland-gambit-sad-sign-arctic-up-for-grabs\">a vast, pristine battleground</a>. Outer space presents infinite possibilities for violence.<br><br>Religious wars are often the most bitterly fought and hardest to halt. As in the past, multiple collisions of faith, culture and values between Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus and other belief systems are key elements in the early 21st century\u2019s insatiable addiction to war.</p> <p>The Muslim world is also divided internally, between the Shia and Sunni traditions and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/24/islamic-state-is-back-and-this-time-the-west-is-ill-prepared-to-take-it-on\">fundamentalist</a> and secular interpretations of Islam. These schisms have been depicted by the Arabic noun <em>fitna</em>, which can mean both \u201ccharm, enchantment, captivation\u201d and \u201crebellion, riot, discord, civil strife\u201d.<br><br>Fitna is a fitting word for describing not only the Islamic sphere but the troubled state of the world as a whole in 2020, beset as it is by wars without end. For many people, if they are honest, war has a fatal attraction.

Since then upwards of<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Syrian_Civil_War\"> half a million people </a>are estimated to have died. </p> <p>The US and Europe also sought to install a friendly, pro-western government in Damascus. As Assad\u2019s grip on power weakened, Russia, supported by Iran, intervened in 2015 to stave off collapse and thwart western ambitions. Other interventions came from Turkey and from Islamic State jihadists, who declared a caliphate in Syria and Iraq.</p> <p>The war continues in the north-western province of Idlib, the last rebel-held stronghold, to which millions have fled. A current ceasefire is not expected to last. There are also fears that up to 100,000 people could die there if Covid-19 spreads in crowded refugee camps.

  "<p>The NHS Covid-19 alert app will be available nationwide in June. It\u2019s voluntary, so those of us with smartphones must decide: should we download the app?</p> <p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, thinks we should, claiming that we would be \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/government-unveils-covid-19-test-and-trace-strategy-for-england\">doing our&nbsp;duty</a>&nbsp;and helping to&nbsp;save lives\u201d.</p> <p>If only it were that simple. Even if 80% of smartphone users (60% of the UK population) download the app, which is the adoption rate epidemiologists say is needed to make it work, the app won\u2019t save lives.</p> <p>Our first problem is that the UK\u2019s testing capability is too slow stop the spread of the virus. Once you\u2019re infected, you\u2019re contagious for two days before the onset of Covid-19 symptoms and most contagious on the first day of symptoms.</p> <p>To break the chain of transmission, you must alert your contacts within that narrow window of opportunity, so that they can quarantine for the 14-day incubation period and report if they too show symptoms and need testing. Yet many people struggle or are unable to get tested, and the average return time for a test result is five days \u2013 with the longest taking 13 days.</p> <p>If we could improve our testing capacity to meet the tight turnaround needed to alert people within the \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d, and if we built an app that sent alerts based on a positive test result, then we might have something useful.</p> <p>However, the app we are being invited to download doesn\u2019t rely on a positive test result. Instead, it asks us to self-report symptoms. This introduces several pathways to failure.</p> <p>The app only asks if you have two out of <a href=\"https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_3\">14 Covid-19 symptoms</a> recognised by the World Health Organization: fever and continuous cough. This means it may fail to account for infected people who show the other symptoms \u2013 and thus will not alert their contacts.</p> <p>The app may not flag up people who don\u2019t have a fever, who account for about a third of positive cases. No self-reporting app will work for people who are infected but never show symptoms, which the US Centers for Disease Control estimates could amount to as many as 30% of cases. Only a test will detect those cases.</p> <p>Still, it can\u2019t do any harm to download the app, right? Actually, no. Unless the government compels employers to pay people to quarantine for 14 days every time they receive an alert, people may feel pressured to ignore the alerts and keep working, even if that risks their health and that of their contacts. Also, not every worker is entitled to sick pay. Those are policy problems, not an app problem, but if we don\u2019t solve them, the app won\u2019t work and the virus will continue to spread.</p> <p>The app also puts our data and privacy at greater risk of an accidental breach or a cyberattack because it is based on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-app-could-be-ditched-for-different-model-after-trials\">centralised model</a>, which stores our data on a central server. A decentralised model, which keeps our data on our devices, minimises this risk. Most other countries have opted for a decentralised model for their app. There\u2019s still time for the UK to change course.</p> <p>Most worrying of all, the government has so far denied parliament the opportunity to pass primary legislation to protect and limit the use of our data relating to using the app.</p> <p>Without such legislation, we risk creating a new set of problems. For instance, do we want the police to have access to our data to enforce quarantine? Do we want our employers to be able to know our Covid-19 status, or to be able to pressure us to download this \u201cvoluntary\u201d app as a condition of returning to work?&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Do we want the police to have access to our data to enforce quarantine, or employers to pressure us to download the app?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Do we want private companies to access this data, the way they already access so much else? Can we request that our data be deleted after the pandemic or will the government retain it indefinitely, and use it however it wants? Will this app exist only for the duration of the pandemic, or could the government require it to be used as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/chinese-city-plans-to-turn-coronavirus-app-into-permanent-health-tracker\">permanent health tracker</a>, as is already being planned in the Chinese city of Hangzhou?</p> <p>The answers to these questions could change our lives and the balance of power between individuals, employers and the state. Parliament must therefore scrutinise all of this and, where necessary, legislate and specify oversight and enforcement mechanisms.</p> <p>A contact tracing app could play a useful role in our pandemic response, but only if we set it up to succeed, not fail. If we create an app that really could help save lives, and which we could use with confidence, there will be no need to ask us to download it out of a sense of duty.</p> <p>We\u2019ll want it.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Stephanie Hare is an independent researcher and broadcaster</p>",

About time too | John Naughton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since joining Twitter more than a decade ago, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Donald Trump has </a>delivered 52,000 tweets or retweets and accumulated 80 million followers. He uses the platform to threaten war, hire and fire staff, goad perceived foes and stoke partisan divisions. Twitter, which did not exist 15 years ago, has become one of the most famous companies in the world, the new first draft of presidential history.</p> <p>But now the relationship is on the rocks.</p> <p>For the first time, Twitter this week added a factchecking tag to two of Trump\u2019s tweets when he made unsubstantiated claims of fraud in mail-in voting. The president struck back on Thursday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/donald-trump-social-media-executive-order-twitter\">with an executive order</a> threatening social media companies with new free speech regulations.</p> <p>Asked if he had considered deleting his account, Trump replied: \u201cIf we had a fair press in this country, I would do that in a heartbeat. There\u2019s nothing I\u2019d rather do than get rid of my whole Twitter account.\u201d</p> <p>A day later, in another first, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">Twitter hid a tweet</a> by Trump behind a warning accusing him of breaking its rules by \u201cglorifying violence\u201d in a message that said looters at protests in Minneapolis would be shot. The president lashed out again in \u2013 naturally \u2013 a tweet, complaining: \u201cTwitter is doing nothing about all of the lies and propaganda being put out by China or the Radical Left Democrat Party. They have targeted Republicans, Conservatives &amp; the President of the United States.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"47a4965b02afa7b597e7ebadaa09d942a42ab76a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47a4965b02afa7b597e7ebadaa09d942a42ab76a/1674_0_2230_2788/800.jpg\" alt=\"Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fran\u00e7ois Mori/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Facebook did not remove Trump\u2019s same post from its site, with its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10111961824369871\">putting clear daylight</a> between his approach, which exempts politicians from a third-party factchecking program, and that of his Twitter counterpart, Jack Dorsey. As for Trump, whose election owed much to social media, he now appears to be biting the hand that feeds him.</p> <p>\u201cI think the last thing Trump wants is to shut down Facebook, YouTube and Twitter,\u201d said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Moonalice?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Roger McNamee,</a> author of Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe. \u201cHe\u2019s completely dependent on them and, by the way, they on him. The symbiosis is complete.</p> <p>\u201cNow, I think what Twitter did relative to the looters and shooters tweet is actually very brave. It\u2019s also incredibly obvious and something they should\u2019ve done years ago, and something Facebook should do, because if you look at the public safety aspect of the terms of service, that tweet is an obvious violation and, coming from the president, it has enormous risk of causing public safety harm.\u201d</p> <p>McNamee, a co-founder of the private equity firm <a href=\"https://elevation.com/\">Elevation Partners</a> and an early investor in Facebook, Google and Amazon, added: \u201cThe fact that Facebook left it up speaks volumes about the different approaches of the two companies because how big do you think Twitter is without Trump? Is it half its current size? Is it less than that? This is a very brave thing for them to do.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s use of Twitter offers <a href=\"https://www.thefortyfifth.us/\">a real-time window on his consciousness</a> at all hours of day and night. Some of his posts are vivid reactions to items he has seen on the Fox News network. Others hurl insults at political foes and the media or traffic in incendiary racism. In the past month they have reached a crescendo of abuse, demagoguery and conspiracy theories, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/26/lori-klausutis-husband-asks-twitter-delete-trump-joe-scarborough-smears-death\">a baseless accusation of murder</a> levelled at a TV host.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SykesCharlie?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Charlie Sykes,</a> a conservative author and broadcaster, said: \u201cHis Twitter account has been central to his presidency and he\u2019s obviously obsessed with it. That\u2019s what makes this so strange: if he were to shut down Twitter, he obviously would deprive himself of a platform. If he succeeds in having the law changed, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/trump-jack-dorsey.html\">it would backfire on him</a> because it would then make the social media platforms liable for his lies and his slanders.\u201d</p> <p>Like a much-hyped executive order in April that threatened to ban immigration, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/21/trump-us-immigration-ban-pause-green-cards\">turned out to have numerous exceptions,</a> the bark of Thursday\u2019s executive order is likely to be worse than its bite.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24460b80e751f78cb1e4d4ce47b44f337e52cc49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24460b80e751f78cb1e4d4ce47b44f337e52cc49/0_0_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump used the New York tabloids to similar trolling effect before Twitter and Facebook came along.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump used the New York tabloids to similar trolling effect before Twitter and Facebook came along.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It attacks legal protections that shield social media companies from liability for users\u2019 content, but a change in the law would require an act of Congress. Observers detected a blatant attempt to deflect attention from Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which this week claimed its 100,000th life in America, and an outbreak of violence after the police killing of a black man in Minneapolis.</p> <p>Sykes, THE founder and editor-at-large of <a href=\"https://thebulwark.com/\">the Bulwark website,</a> added: \u201cTo be attacking a private company because it factchecked him is a disturbing look, even for Trump. The willingness to use the full weight of federal government to go in and punish a private company for factchecking one of his tweets.</p> <p>\u201cTwitter did not censor his tweet. It answered his tweet with a factcheck. In other words, it answered speech with more speech, which is the way the first amendment is supposed to work.\u201d</p> <p>Trump expressed anger last year after <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/04/tech/trump-social-media-twitter-facebook/index.html\">Facebook banned seven users</a> including the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, rightwing media stars Milo Yiannopoulos and Laura Loomer, and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, notorious for using antisemitic language. He and fellow conservatives have long claimed without evidence that Silicon Valley tech companies are biased against them.</p> <p>Twitter first announced in early 2018 that it would not block world leaders or remove their controversial tweets, though it subsequently announced that it could apply warning labels and obscure the tweets of world leaders if they used their accounts to threaten or abuse others. Despite this week\u2019s skirmishes, the prospect of the US president being banned still seems remote.</p> <p>Sykes commented: \u201cI think that\u2019s unlikely to happen. Banning Trump allows him to play the victim card and say, \u2018Look, I am the president and they won\u2019t let me speak\u2019. So it makes him a martyr. It\u2019s probably better to factcheck him. On the other hand, that\u2019s going to be extremely difficult. Are they going to factcheck every one of his tweets?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"200c345ae4c06bfd0195b085370db610cad79bd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/200c345ae4c06bfd0195b085370db610cad79bd7/0_175_4500_2699/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter page is displayed on a mobile phone on Thursday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter page is displayed on a mobile phone on Thursday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivier Douliery/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cDoes that mean they\u2019re going to be under tremendous pressure to factcheck everyone else? There\u2019s a danger for Twitter that he will drag them down the rabbit hole, that he will make their factchecking of him into another massive distraction issue.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has put Twitter front and centre in public life but he is not its most followed personality. To his probable chagrin, THE No 1 spot is held by Obama with 118 million, <a href=\"https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/most-twitter-followers/\">according to Brandwatch,</a> ahead of singers Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Rihanna, Taylor Swift, footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, singer Lady Gaga and TV personality Ellen DeGeneres. Then comes Trump in ninth place.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rickwtyler?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Rick Tyler,</a> a political analyst, said: \u201cHe [Trump] needs Twitter because it\u2019s his vehicle to communicate with millions of people who follow him. I\u2019m not sure Twitter needs him and, if it does need him, then it\u2019s a flawed business model because Trump one day won\u2019t be with us. He\u2019s an old man and so if Twitter\u2019s business model depends on Donald Trump, it\u2019s a very short-lived business model.\u201d</p> <p>The president\u2019s threat to terminate his love-hate relationship with social media rings somewhat hollow. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/profiles/michael-dantonio\">Biographer Michael D\u2019Antonio</a> describes him as \u201ca troll at heart\u201d who used the New York tabloids to similar effect before Twitter and Facebook came along. He said of the current feud: \u201cI think it\u2019s about Twitter being his drug and Jack Dorsey threatening to limit his supply.</p> <p>\u201cIt has the effect of a drug on him, so the pleasure that he gets from tweeting and from the response to his tweet probably gives him a rush and I think even the thought of it being constrained is painful, probably physically painful in his own body.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s also him encountering someone who can hold him responsible and, as he makes clear, he\u2019s never responsible for anything, and that is enraging. It\u2019s like the kid who\u2019s been let loose in a candy store and suddenly an adult says, \u2018Well, that\u2019s all done now, it\u2019s time for you to leave,\u2019 and he doesn\u2019t want to leave so he\u2019s having a tantrum.\u201d</p>",

That leaves them with the choice of playing the rest of the campaign to its conclusion, nine rounds of matches and two play-off weekends, and delaying the start of the following season, or cutting it short and risk having to pay their broadcasters, BT Sport, a rebate.</p> <p>Players are due to return to training by the end of the week, first in small clusters who all arrive at the training venue separately and maintain the rules on distancing throughout, and later in groups when contact will be allowed.

With matches expected to be played behind closed doors for at least most of the year \u2013 a number of Premiership clubs have delayed the sale of season tickets for 2020-21 \u2013 there would be little commercial gain for them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/29/premiership-rugby-unlikely-to-return-until-late-july-at-earliest\">Premiership players will need six weeks of training before return, study finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Top-flight clubs need a return to action to start generating income again, having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/23/wasps-chief-steven-vaughan-premiership-rugby-union-new-normal\">largely mothballed their businesses</a> during the lockdown. There is concern at the cost of following the strict health and hygiene regulations laid down for a phased return to training, not least testing of players, coaches and management teams, which is expected to consume \u00a3100,000 a week, as well as protective equipment and the material for deep cleans.</p> <p>BT has paid its final quarterly instalment of about \u00a38m to Premiership Rugby, which has kept the money in central funds. That would provide the means to pay for testing, with clubs receiving reduced payouts. Add to that the government saying that players would be allowed to remain on furlough up to the point they started playing again, and two of the clubs\u2019 main financial concerns about a return to training have been met.</p> <p>The key issue then becomes minimising the risk for players. World Rugby\u2019s chief medical officer, Martin Raftery, believes that the physical nature of rugby did not make it more of a risk than other sports because Covid-19 was transmitted through cough, respiratory and saliva droplets rather than sweat, but no one can accurately quantify the risk. Exeter\u2019s director of rugby, Rob Baxter, said playing outdoors would be safer than going to a supermarket, but what about the dressing room, where distancing would have to be maintained?</p> <p>Professor John Williams, Wales\u2019s former team doctor, who is still involved with the squad, says: \u201cThe key will be to manage the risk. The ideal would be for teams to operate in a bubble, but that will not happen, so access to training grounds and dressing rooms will have to be strictly restricted and supervised.</p> <p>\u201cWith players tested regularly, any threat will come from someone outside, so if a player needs treatment for an injury or has a mouth wound that requires dental work, the person carrying out the procedure will need to wear full protective equipment. And players will have to make sacrifices, remaining at home when they are not training or playing, and telling the club doctor immediately if they develop symptoms of the virus. Like everyone, they have to use their common sense.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64006eef2ee0de5cffb3f1d2e7c25b093aa55c01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64006eef2ee0de5cffb3f1d2e7c25b093aa55c01/42_0_4465_2680/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Venues such as the Twickenham Stoop have been quiet since professional rugby was forced to shut down because of the coronavirus crisis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Venues such as the Twickenham Stoop have been quiet since professional rugby was forced to shut down because of the coronavirus crisis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Fosker/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAs restrictions are gradually lifted, they will not be able to behave like their friends because one failed test could see an entire squad having to isolate.

That would have an impact on the Premiership should someone test positive in the days after a match.

A 25-point lead at the top of the Premier League sounds as ridiculous now as it did when games were suspended, and though many a joke has been made about Covid-19 and title number 19, Liverpool have been so demonstrably superior to the rest of the division this season that almost everyone has sympathy for the way their regal progress was halted by factors beyond their control.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/may/30/premier-league-restart-spectre-financial-catastrophe\">Football is back and all it took was the spectre of financial catastrophe | Jonathan Liew</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The situation at the top of the Premier League is as uncomplicated as it is possible to be at this stage of the season, and though the battle for fourth place and the Europa League positions promises to be quite lively, at that end of the table no one is going to face financial calamity through fixtures being completed in compromised circumstances.</p> <p>It is a different story at the bottom, where the clubs under threat of relegation must have enormous, if private, misgivings about playing out the season without spectators. Only a couple of weeks ago <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/09/watford-chairman-questions-integrity-of-distorted-mini-league-at-neutral-venues\">Watford were successfully arguing</a> that the plan to play games at neutral venues would be to the detriment of clubs who were relying on their home fixtures for the points necessary to survive. No sooner had that fight been won than news arrived from Germany that<em> </em>without spectators, home advantage does not appear to count for much anyway. Of the 27 games played in Germany before this weekend, only five resulted in home wins, fewer than 20%.</p> <p>By contrast, 11 matches or just over 40% resulted in victory for the away side, some by thumping scores. From this (admittedly limited) evidence, home advantage has little do do with familiarity with the dressing rooms or the nap of the turf and everything to do with the presence of a vocal and partisan crowd, whether urging the home players on to greater heights of performance or intimidating opponents and perhaps the referee.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1ca1dd67a412f1e50549bbd0573659410048e1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1ca1dd67a412f1e50549bbd0573659410048e1f/0_133_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A behind-closed-doors match in South Korea between Incheon United FC vs Deagu FC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A behind-closed-doors match in South Korea between Incheon United FC vs Deagu FC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Who knew?

Players just get on with the game, quite possibly because it has suddenly become more of a contractual duty than a means of self-expression.

  "<p>They are known as MBs \u2013 microbeats \u2013 small sections of London synonymous with drugs and violence.

These would be given the task of ensuring serious crime never <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/jan/23/proportion-of-suspects-charged-or-summonsed-drops-to-78\">returned</a> to pre-lockdown levels.</p> <p>It was decided that the units, and their 620 officers, would target around 250 of London\u2019s most alarming microbeats. But their arrival also signifies something deeper, confirming the end of austerity, where dwindling police numbers were forced to beat a retreat from the streets. Organised criminals proved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/10/senior-officer-suggests-austerity-fuelled-surge-in-violent\">adept</a> at filling the vacuum \u2013 the county line business model <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/13/gangs-still-forcing-children-into-county-lines-drug-trafficking-police-covid-19-lockdown\">prospered</a>, with thousands of youngsters exploited as drug runners.

During last Wednesday\u2019s stand-off, an officer from the unit left his car and began remonstrating with the group. Gang members began backing away. They soon dispersed. The assertive policing was deliberate.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re back to being part of society again, recognised as part of the community.

On Friday, the Met appealed for witnesses after a 21-year-old was stabbed in the back with a \u2018\u201csmall bladed weapon\u201d on London Road.&nbsp;</p> <p>During the year to April almost 11,000 offences of violence against the person were recorded in Croydon. Only Westminster, which covers central London, counted more. Of those in Croydon, 3,750 were classified as \u201cviolence with injury\u201d. Again, of the capital\u2019s 33 boroughs, only Westminster experienced more.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sgt Paul Looker of the VSU gestured ahead as the station came into view. \u201cHere we are, you might notice a difference in the area,\u201d said the 45-year-old.&nbsp;</p> <p>An imitation handgun and a large machete were recently found hidden beneath marrows at a London Road grocery, planted by gang members should a situation escalate. Officers are investigating if the store was complicit or coerced. The latter would be no major revelation. The dealers of London Road are adroit in intimidation. Large groups of 20 congregate on its corners. It might seem odd that criminals would choose to be conspicuous, but fear is currency in west Croydon. \u201cIt\u2019s designed to intimidate \u2013 intimidate rivals, the community, even us,\u201d said Looker.</p> <p>The sizeable groups serve another purpose. Standing in their centre, encircled by layers of enforcers, is the primary drug holder. \u201cOften the carrier is in the middle. If you approach they can start jostling and run in every direction. They know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d said Looker.&nbsp;</p> <p>Tensions between gangs periodically flare on London Road. A video emerged last year showing youngsters fighting on the street in broad daylight with metal pipes as weapons. Yet the complexities of gangland territory dictate that most have learned to coexist. \u201cThey even help each other, work with each other and sometimes hang out together,\u201d said Looker.</p> <p>While groups maintain an overt presence amid the bustle of London Road, it\u2019s off the&nbsp;main drag where deals are made. The station car park is particularly \u201chot\u201d, so too the labyrinthine alleyways and dead-ends off nearby Mead Place and Derby Road.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6072cd2c40cf95c69bd738d443dfde76d364cd0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6072cd2c40cf95c69bd738d443dfde76d364cd0/0_0_2682_3987/673.jpg\" alt=\"A school photograph of Zac Olumegbon, 15, who was stabbed and later died in west Norwood in July 2010.\" width=\"673\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A school photograph of Zac Olumegbon, 15, who was stabbed and later died in west Norwood in July 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fiona Hanson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Further south lies Croydon\u2019s central shopping strip where heroin and crack users shoplift to afford their next hit. Outside Marks &amp; Spencer a fresh-faced officer belonging to Looker\u2019s unit is chatting to teenagers seen \u201cfloating around the area\u201d in a suspicious manner.&nbsp;</p> <p>Alex is one of the Met\u2019s 700 new recruits, the first tranche of the 20,000 extra officers promised in England and Wales by the government.&nbsp;</p> <p>The 26-year-old began policing three weeks ago. A fortnight into his fledgling Met career he found his first Rambo knife. Following intelligence over the weekend he searched a man on the Ben Hill estate in nearby Sutton and recovered a large kitchen knife. \u201cIt\u2019s about trying to stop something before it happens,\u201d said Alex.</p> <p>Looker said the new recruits brought an enthusiasm that had been challenged during the years of declining officer numbers. \u201cThey\u2019re not jaded,\u201d he said. \u201cAusterity had got people down. And belonging to a VSU means you\u2019re out on the streets, it\u2019s rewarding.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>The units, says Looker, promise a return to the old-school principles of pounding the pavement while accumulating policing\u2019s most precious commodity: intelligence. Officers are taught to know every detail of a microbeat, the new faces, the backstory of each shopkeeper, every beggar. During one shift last week, the eight officers of a team belonging to Croydon\u2019s VSU acquired 24 intelligence reports, each offering promising leads. \u201cFrom a violence perspective we\u2019ve never had that before,\u201d said Knight.</p> <p>He appreciates the flow of information from the community will be critical to reducing&nbsp;the violence. During a recent visit to a Croydon MB he talked to its homeless, often the eyes and ears of the street.&nbsp;\u201cI spoke to all the vagrants, got their life story, and tested the team if they also knew.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c88878498f9422e24d37ece9debbedf9abd983ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c88878498f9422e24d37ece9debbedf9abd983ac/0_0_1200_1600/750.jpg\" alt=\"A knife seized by police in an arrest by the VSU in Croydon in May.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A knife seized by police in an arrest by the VSU in Croydon on 28 May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Metropolitan Police</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Also critical will be stemming the flow of youngsters to the street gangs. Around&nbsp;93,000 under-18s are within the Met\u2019s south area command. Within deprived locales such as west Croydon the dealing gangs are adroit at grooming vulnerable children and adolescents anxious to prove themselves.&nbsp;</p> <p>The pace of exploitation can be shocking. Looker refers to a recent case where they caught a youngster in care carrying cannabis for a gang. The child had arrived in Croydon just two days earlier.&nbsp;</p> <p>Even the lowest snippet of intelligence is scrutinised for signs a child might be at risk.&nbsp;Reports that a minor has started carrying a knife lead to their school being notified and social services alerted. Currently, around 20 youngsters a month are identified in Croydon and targeted with programmes encouraging them to change direction. None are criminalised. Officers know children who offend are often themselves victims.&nbsp;</p> <p>One child told Knight that his family was so poor they could not afford electricity two nights a week. \u201cHe ended up shoplifting to feed his family. It\u2019s part of their backstory and you have to be aware of that,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Insp Kathy Morteo is responsible for ensuring Croydon\u2019s vulnerable children avoid the clutches of the London Road gangs. She tours youth groups and schools, asking teachers if they\u2019ve noticed signs of gang involvement or rumours of knife carrying among pupils. \u201cMy job is protecting the youth of tomorrow,\u201d said Morteo.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re back to being part of society again, recognised as part of the community</p> <footer> <cite>Ch Insp Craig Knight</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Looker knows what can happen when intervention fails. A decade ago he was first on the scene to reports of a child stabbed outside a school in Streatham, south London. He found <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-16283113\">Zac Olumegbon</a> lying on his back in the garden of a house metres from the school. Four members of a Brixton gang had stabbed the 15-year-old twice in the heart. \u201cNothing can prepare you for that. You\u2019re seeing a small child, a dead child,\u201d said Looker.&nbsp;</p> <p>The VSU ultimately hopes to break tit-for-tat gangland attacks among pupils. Among its first objectives, however, is eradicating Croydon\u2019s \u201chabitual knife carriers\u201d from its streets.&nbsp;\u201cWe pursue them, disrupt them, get them on anything. Every possible effort is made to target them,\u201d said Knight.&nbsp;</p> <p>Originally they identified 22 habitual knife carriers operating across the command area. Soon it was down to four. Another was arrested last Tuesday.&nbsp;</p> <p>During the week to last Wednesday, Croydon\u2019s VSU made 28 arrests, <a href=\"https://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/18480774.knives-drugs-seized-south-london-raids/\">seized seven knives</a>, conducted 104 weapon sweeps and executed 240 intelligence-led stop and searches.&nbsp;</p> <p>Looker is a staunch advocate of the latter, aware it can be controversial. When its use declined he believes gangs were emboldened to carry more lethal weaponry. \u201cSome of the knives were absolutely horrible,\u201d said Looker.&nbsp;</p> <p>Currently, there are 28 microbeats across Croydon, Sutton and Bromley. Some are 20 square metres, others the length of a high street. Many encircle west Croydon, including hotspots for teenage street robberies.</p> <p>During the coronavirus containment measures, robberies across the command area fell from 170 a month to around 60. Now the lockdown is easing, the old criminal patterns are re-emerging. Can Croydon\u2019s entrenched relationship with violence be quashed? Looker is confident. \u201cWe\u2019ll turn the corner.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The eurozone\u2019s 19 member countries are braced for a dramatic downturn. The head of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, warned last week that the bloc\u2019s collective GDP was likely to shrink by between 8% and 12% this year, having concluded that the ECB\u2019s \u201cmedium\u201d and \u201csevere\u201d scenarios were the only ones worth considering.</p> <p>The economic consequences of coronavirus are dire already, with France and Italy in recession. France\u2019s GDP contracted by 5.8% in the first quarter of 2020, following a decline of 0.1% in the preceding three months. Italy saw its GDP fall by 4.7% in the first quarter of 2020, in the wake of a 0.3% decline in late 2019. As a whole, eurozone GDP decreased by 3.8% in the first three months of 2020 \u2013 the sharpest quarterly decline since records began in 1995.</p> <p>The betting is that Lagarde and the rest of the ECB board will use this week\u2019s meeting to expand its \u20ac750bn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/ecb-asset-purchase-programme-boosts-euro\" title=\"\">Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme</a> (PEPP). For many ECB-watchers, this will show how important the PEPP has been during lockdown and offer proof, if that were needed, that states are struggling to revive their economies.</p> <p>The programme, which lets the ECB fund private companies and government budgets by purchasing corporate debt and sovereign bonds, will probably increase to \u20ac1 trillion and could eventually reach \u20ac1.5tn.</p> <p>Lagarde has repeated the mantra of her predecessor, Mario Draghi: the ECB will do whatever it takes to keep the eurozone economies afloat. This should reassure businesses and consumers that any financial wobbles, wherever they crop up inside the eurozone, will be confronted by the ECB\u2019s limitless supply of funds.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Lagarde needs to quickly address the court\u2019s concerns, or risk the programme grinding to a halt. But she will need backing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But there is increasing nervousness in Italy and Spain, where the ECB plays a crucial funding role, that a recent German constitutional court ruling could circumscribe the ECB\u2019s power. This month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/05/jolt-to-eurozone-as-german-court-warns-against-central-bank-stimulus\" title=\"\">Germany\u2019s federal constitutional court set aside a 2018 European court of justice (ECJ) ruling</a> and questioned the legality of ECB asset purchases. The German judges said the ECB had overstepped its mandate with the programme, which in turn prompted the ECJ to issue a polite reminder that it alone has the power to decide whether EU bodies are breaching the bloc\u2019s rules. It had ruled in 2018 that such a bond-buying programme was legal. And thus battle lines between Brussels and Berlin have been drawn.</p> <p>Speaking this month, an EU official said: \u201cThis raises a couple of fundamental issues \u2026 first is the authority of a judgment of the European court of justice which has definitely ruled on the validity of the decisions of the ECB. This goes to the very basis of the European Union. The European Union is based on law, on agreement, on the common rules we have.\u201d</p> <p>Lagarde needs to quickly address the court\u2019s concerns, or risk the bailout programme grinding to a halt. But she will need backing. The political and economic threat of not resolving the row could be seismic, and the help of the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, will be required. Merkel, the leader of the eurozone\u2019s most powerful economy, has said that a clash between Brussels and Germany can be avoided if, as per the German court ruling, the ECB illustrates the necessity of its bond-buying scheme.</p> <p>If the standoff is not resolved and the ECB\u2019s rescue programme is stymied, then the eurozone\u2019s recession will deepen and political and economic fault lines in the EU will widen. A lot is at stake at this week\u2019s meeting, and Lagarde needs the EU and Germany to square their differences.</p> <h2>Sunak must go further on furlough<br></h2> <p>The chancellor has clearly listened to demands that his main employment subsidy scheme should be scaled down gradually. A cliff-edge that loomed in August for the 8.4 million workers furloughed since April has become a gentler slope, although there are still huge risks ahead for Rishi Sunak, Britain\u2019s 32 million workers and the economy\u2019s prospects of emerging from the crisis relatively unscathed.</p> <p>The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme currently pays 80% of a worker\u2019s salary up to a cap of \u00a32,500 a month. Until last week, the chancellor was going to change the terms so that employers received only 60% of a worker\u2019s wages from 1 August. This would have been a huge cost to tens of thousands of shuttered businesses. Sunak has noted this. From August, employers will only need to find the money for employers\u2019 national insurance and pension payments for furloughed staff.</p> <p>Then comes the slope: from 1 September the government will pay 70% of wages. During October it will be 60%. Self-employed workers will receive a matching grant worth 70% of their average monthly trading profits to cover three months from August.</p> <p>Nonetheless, there is a missing element from Sunak\u2019s plans. There are industries that will receive very little or no income from paying customers from now until October and beyond. What is the chancellor going to do to rescue Britain\u2019s mighty tourism industry, its leisure centres, gyms, hotels, bars and nightclubs? Physical distancing will limit their recovery until, or if, a vaccine arrives.</p> <p>They should be candidates for further support after October. It would be tragic if the UK reduced subsidies before businesses can stand unaided, triggering a jump in bankruptcies and unemployment that would undermine the good work of recent months.</p> <h2>Rolls-Royce\u2019s plight signals importance of state support</h2> <p>Rolls-Royce has been hit hard by the coronavirus crisis. Credit ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s piled on the pain for the manufacturer last week, marking down its debt \u2013 after 20 years at investment grade \u2013 to junk status.</p> <p>While its defence business \u2013 making parts for fighter jet and nuclear submarine engines \u2013 is largely unaffected, the group\u2019s civil aerospace operation has stuttered alongside the grounded airlines to which it sells engines and servicing contracts. The planned cutting of 9,000 jobs, the bulk of them at UK sites including its Derby base, are a major blow to British engineering.</p> <p>The rating downgrade could have material implications. Many institutional investors are, understandably, banned from buying junk bonds, so S&amp;P\u2019s move could make it more costly for Rolls-Royce to borrow if costs continue to mount.</p> <p>It is also striking that the downgrade came after swingeing cost cuts and Rolls-Royce\u2019s professed willingness to ask for government support. The company, one of the few true global players left in UK manufacturing and a key part of UK defence plans, will be helped if needed; the shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, has signalled that he would back support. Rolls-Royce\u2019s stock of goodwill with government has also been aided by its involvement in Ventilator Challenge UK, the effort to build machines to treat Covid-19 patients.</p> <p>The financial crisis a decade ago showed that ratings agencies are often more weather vane than fortune teller, but when it comes to crunch time for companies, their views are still important. The junking of Rolls-Royce\u2019s rating shows that investors may not be reliable providers of help for the struggling aerospace sector.</p> <p>S&amp;P warned that Rolls-Royce could be exposed to further losses as the pandemic drags on. If things are this bad for Rolls-Royce, smaller companies, whose size does not warrant a rating agency\u2019s attentions, will be under much greater pressure.</p>",
  "<p>When this roadside sign caught <a href=\"https://janehilton.com/films/\">Jane Hilton\u2019s </a>eye in Dayton, Nevada, back in 2002 she decided to capture the image as an exemplar of the deadpan humour of the sagebrush state. \u201cLittle did I know how pertinent it would feel almost two decades later, after two months of lockdown,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the timing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>Hilton made her name documenting US culture, in particular the American west, over the past 20 years. At the time she took this photograph she was directing a documentary series for BBC Three called <em>Love for Sale</em><em> </em>about sex workers in Nevada, the only American state where prostitution is legal.</p> <p>\u201cI lived for a year in two brothels near Dayton and the producer and I used to go into the town for some light relief in the evenings and have the most delicious steak dinners at the Old Union hotel. Dayton is quite magical. It\u2019s like an old wild west town on the cusp of the desert,\u201d Hilton says.</p> <p>Part of the town\u2019s draw is that it was the location for John Huston\u2019s <em>The Misfits</em>, the 1961 drama that proved to be the last ever film appearance of its stars, Marilyn Monroe and Clark Gable. \u201cI totally get why <em>The Misfits</em> was shot there.

  "<p>The circumstances surrounding the 29 May arrest of the CNN reporter Omar Jimenez couldn\u2019t be clearer, more obvious, less subject to doubt or debate.&nbsp;You need only watch the video of the incident to know: this is not fake news.</p> <p>In Minneapolis, Omar Jimenez was covering the protests ignited by the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man killed by the police. Confronted by a phalanx of state policemen in riot gear, Jimenez offered to move back. \u201cWe\u2019re getting out of your way. Just let us know. Wherever you want us, we will go.\u201d He calmly identified himself as a CNN journalist and produced his credentials. Nonetheless, he was handcuffed and led away, as he continued to ask, peacefully and respectfully, why he was being arrested. Soon after, his producer and cameraman were also cuffed and marched off. One can hear the distraught cameraman asking what to do with his camera, which was seized by the police \u2013&nbsp;apparently unaware that it was still filming.</p> <p>What the camera doesn\u2019t show is that a few blocks away, a white journalist, also reporting for CNN, was treated by the police with consummate politeness. So what we see, and don\u2019t see, is the convergence of two profoundly toxic streams growing stronger and deeper as they continue to poison our society. One is the erosion of our first amendment protections \u2013&nbsp;Jimenez\u2019s right to document and describe what he was seeing is constitutionally guaranteed \u2013&nbsp;and the other is the systemic racism that explains why a black reporter was arrested while a white one was encouraged to do his job; why a Minneapolis police officer jammed his knee into George Floyd\u2019s neck for eight fatal minutes; and why, almost every week, another black person is killed by the police or \u2013 like Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery \u2013 by freelance white vigilantes.&nbsp;</p> <p>One shudders to think what might have happened to Jimenez, a black man in a tense confrontation with law enforcement, had he not been employed by CNN and accompanied by a camera crew.&nbsp;</p> <p>For many years, organizations such as PEN and the Committee to Protect Journalists have been working to safeguard the rights \u2013 and the lives \u2013 of writers and reporters around the world. Mostly, the arrests, imprisonments and murders of journalists have occurred in (and at the behest of) totalitarian regimes, and in countries in which the lawlessness of criminal cartels has gone largely unchecked. Among the most famous cases were the 2006 murder of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya outside her Moscow home and the 2018 killing of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul. In just the last two weeks, a Mexican reporter, Jorge Armenta, was murdered and the car of another journalist was firebombed in Sonora state. The silencing of journalists is the hallmark of the dictatorship and the mafia state; threats and violence are the tactics traditionally employed by the powerful and the corrupt to intimidate those who try to expose corruption and the abuses of power.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve watched our president deriding the press and encouraging his followers to put their faith in conspiracy theories rather than in facts</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But that was always somewhere else, happening to other people, and American exceptionalism allowed us to advocate for \u2013 and feel slightly removed from \u2013 the reporters attacked and imprisoned in other countries, on other continents. Meanwhile the assaults on freedom of speech and on those who try to exercise that freedom have edged closer and closer to home. We\u2019ve watched our president deriding the press and encouraging his followers to put their faith in conspiracy theories rather than in facts. We\u2019ve witnessed the relentlessness with which Donald Trump has attacked the media, we\u2019ve seen Trump and his enablers\u2019 unapologetic disregard for the truth and for those who work to discover and tell that truth. And we\u2019ve noted how Trump\u2019s covert and overt racism has essentially legitimized and encouraged violence against immigrants and people of color while exacerbating the hatred and bigotry that have always been endemic in our society. It was Donald Trump, after all, who referred to the protesters as \u201cthugs\u201d and who suggested that looters should be shot.&nbsp;</p> <p>Given all that, I suppose we shouldn\u2019t be so deeply surprised when a black reporter is handcuffed and arrested for the crime of doing his job. And yet we are. One of the most striking things about the video of Jimenez\u2019s arrest is the response of the CNN commentators watching the live feed from the newsroom, or whatever the pandemic equivalent of the newsroom is. One says, \u201cThat is an American television reporter being led away by police \u2026 I\u2019ve never seen anything like this \u2026 Having been in the middle of protests, I\u2019ve never seen anything like this.\u201d The emphasis on <em>American</em> television reporter is significant as&nbsp;the commentator repeats, for a third time: I\u2019ve never seen anything like this.&nbsp;</p> <p>Well, one wants to say, now you have. It\u2019s our turn. It\u2019s happening here, right now. The climate has shifted \u2013 away from the assurances of the first amendment, away from the pretense of a color-blind, egalitarian society \u2013 and towards a moment when the arrest of a working journalist, a black journalist, is still startling, but dishearteningly foreseeable.&nbsp;</p> <p>Incidents like this will continue to happen, and perhaps get worse, unless we remain vigilant and make our outrage known. Omar Jimenez and his camera crew have been released from police custody. George Floyd\u2019s killer has been charged with manslaughter and third-degree murder, perhaps in part because the protesters and their supporters refused to keep quiet and let it go.&nbsp;We can\u2019t stop paying attention and, more important, <em>calling</em> attention to the importance of the free press and to the horrors of racism. The mistake was always to think that it can\u2019t happen here, because it can, it has and \u2013 unless we remain aware and <em>vocal</em> \u2013 it most certainly will again.</p> <ul> <li><p>Francine Prose is a novelist and the former president of PEN America</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>Soon after she opens her new standup comedy show, <em>Douglas</em>, the Australian comedian Hannah Gadsby challenges the audience by asking: \u201cIf you\u2019re here because of <em>Nanette</em>, why? What the fuck are you expecting of this show? I\u2019m sorry, but, if it\u2019s more trauma, I\u2019m fresh out.\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81054700\">Douglas</a></em>, now available on Netflix, is Gadsby\u2019s follow up to her global standup phenomenon, <em><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80233611\">Nanette</a></em>. <em>Nanette</em> was a scream of visceral soul-baring, with Gadsby venting her rage and pain about being a woman, being gay, about homophobia (recounting how she\u2019d been beaten up in the street), institutionalised misogyny, and more, all the while deconstructing comedy itself. By the time <em>Nanette</em> aired on Netflix in 2018, Gadsby, now 42, had been performing standup for more than a decade, as well as acting and writing, but her blistering honesty, and refusal to let audiences off the hook, hit a universal nerve. <em>Nanette</em> was hailed as a #MeToo-era comedy game-changer, garnering awards including the (shared) best comedy prize at the 2017 Edinburgh fringe, introducing Gadsby to America and a wider international audience, and winning fans such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/27/roxane-gay-writer-interview-literary-fiction-reading-diversely\">Roxan</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/27/roxane-gay-writer-interview-literary-fiction-reading-diversely\">e Gay</a>, Monica Lewinsky and Emma Thompson.</p> <p>\u201cI honestly didn\u2019t think that <em>Nanette</em> would be successful. It was the one thing my trolls and I have in common,\u201d says Gadsby wryly, when she speaks to me over the phone from her Australian home. Gadsby \u201cquit comedy\u201d onstage as part of the <em>Nanette</em> set, but clearly this wasn\u2019t meant literally? \u201cYeah, <em>Nanette</em> was not the end it claimed to be. It was a point of exasperation,\u201d she says. \u201cI was expecting <em>Nanette</em> to put me in a position where I would have to scale back what I did with my comedy. I thought it would alienate my audience. And that was the surprise of <em>Nanette</em> \u2013 what I thought would push me into a corner did the opposite\u2026 I thought, I don\u2019t have to jump, I can do what I want.\u201d</p> <p>Our phone call suffers from occasional time lags, which sometimes means I ask Gadsby a new question while she\u2019s still answering the previous one. Gadsby is good-humoured about this, and friendly and engaged. In conversation, she\u2019s still recognisable from her quick-witted stage persona, just with the voltage turned down. Was it a pressure to come back with <em>Douglas</em> after <em>Nanette</em>\u2019s huge success? \u201cI didn\u2019t feel desperate to overcome that because that\u2019s an impossible fight. I just set up camp in the shadow of <em>Nanette</em>.\u201d Later, she says dryly: \u201cI\u2019m focusing on the inevitable fall. What I figure is that \u2013 what goes up must come down. I want to be able to negotiate that as gracefully as possible.\u201d One thing that struck Gadsby was that the level of attention she got for <em>Nanette</em> could be \u201caddictive\u201d. \u201cAnd the only way you get that level of attention is you do something that has an impact. I managed to do that once but I don\u2019t expect that every time. Unless I try to stay shocking and that\u2019s not what I want to do. I made a choice \u2013 that not everything I do will make that kind of impact \u2013 and that\u2019s good.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziIwxPCeByU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ziIwxPCeByU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziIwxPCeByU\">Watch a trailer for Gadby\u2019s new show, Douglas.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The main focus of <em>Douglas</em> is Gadsby\u2019s high-functioning autism. Other themes range from chauvinism and male ownership of culture (the show is named after one of Gadsby\u2019s dogs, but also refers to the \u201cpouch of Douglas\u201d, a part of the female anatomy, named by a male scientist), America (\u201cMaking fun of Americans is still technically punching up, but that window is closing\u201d), anti-vaxxers, her now-signature art history musings (Gadsby has a degree in art history and curatorship), all the way through to golf, dog parks, Taylor Swift and <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>.</p> <p><em>Douglas</em> is markedly more playful than <em>Nanette</em>: \u201cI did all the heavy lifting with <em>Nanette</em>, so I thought it would defeat the purpose \u2013 you know, dwelling,\u201d says Gadsby. \u201cIt felt like a time to be more playful, show a breadth of form. I wanted to show that there\u2019s life after trauma, and more than one way to skin a cat.\u201d</p> <p>In <em>Douglas</em>, she describes getting her autism diagnosis as a \u201crelief\u201d. \u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cI was working things out for myself on a false premise. And it made me see things a lot clearer. Why I got things wrong. Why I felt like an alien dropped in from outer space. It\u2019s just good to know that I am an alien.\u201d She laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s very helpful.\u201d</p> <p>Gadsby says she could have dealt with autism in a traumatic way in <em>Douglas</em>. \u201cThere are stories I could tell that are heartbreaking, and very painful to me, and I could have shared those. I chose not to do that. That\u2019s not to say I was scared of doing it. I just didn\u2019t want that to be underpinning it. Too often, I think autism is expected to be a freak show. I wanted to create points of accessibility. There will be a point when I can flesh out the ways in which it is a difficult existence, but I didn\u2019t think this was the time.\u201d</p> <p>Gadsby was diagnosed with autism before <em>Nanette</em> but decided against featuring it in that show. \u201cIt would just have become a way to dismiss what I was saying.\u201d Gadsby also needed time to process her diagnosis, not least because the public perception of autism remains a minefield of stigma and generalisations. \u201cI think there\u2019s just such a narrow definition of what autism is,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople want to compartmentalise difference, but it\u2019s not that easy. It\u2019s called a spectrum for a reason.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5b7dcbb82388750c9ca5a01042639509344e6db2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b7dcbb82388750c9ca5a01042639509344e6db2/0_722_4961_6197/801.jpg\" alt=\"Gadsby: \u2018I love learning and stories but I\u2019m not great at reading.

I never graduated from picture books.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: pr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gadsby grew up as the youngest of five children in Tasmania, where homosexuality was illegal until 1997 (in <em>Nanette</em>, she spoke about how this led to her internalising homophobia). As a small child, she felt isolated, which she now realises was due to her autism. \u201cYou know when you have a radio and it\u2019s two or three notches out of being on the right station? But there was a lot of consistency in my childhood. We lived in a fairly sheltered world, which is a good thing for someone with autism. If I\u2019d been bought up in a rich family who were able to take me to Disneyland, then <em>that</em> would have been traumatic.\u201d She laughs. \u201cEven as an adult, Disneyland is hell. It\u2019s what migraines are made of.\u201d</p> <p>Gadsby suffered a breakdown in her late teenage years, and was homeless for a while, moving from job to job, working in bookshops, as a projectionist at an outdoor cinema, planting trees, picking vegetables. Eventually, she managed to apply to university, and enjoyed studying for her degree: \u201cI love learning and I love stories but I\u2019m not great at reading. Art history made the world accessible to me. Basically, I never graduated from picture books.\u201d</p> <p>Gadsby found her voice in comedy, though, as much as <em>Nanette</em> was praised, it was also widely criticised, which she deals with in <em>Douglas</em>. Some claimed it \u201cwasn\u2019t standup comedy\u201d; it was performance art, a lecture, a one-woman show, group therapy, or \u201cjust wasn\u2019t funny\u201d. Some men seemed personally affronted. \u201cWell, yeah, you know people who call other people snowflakes are projecting,\u201d says Gadsby. She says in <em>Douglas</em>: \u201cYour hate is my vaccine.\u201d Does that indicate she\u2019s fairly immune to the trolling? \u201cYeah, it\u2019s the micro-dosing thing,\u201d says Gadsby. \u201cEvery time one of these blokes comes in and says something that they believe is devastating, what confounds me is that they think they\u2019re original. That it\u2019s going to be the first time I\u2019ve heard this. You know? I\u2019ve lived a life. I\u2019ve heard it all before.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, Gadsby expected to be attacked: \u201cYou don\u2019t do a show like <em>Nanette</em> without a tough shell. I\u2019m fairly robust when it comes to stuff like that.\u201d If anything, she was complimented: \u201cI\u2019m a student of art history. It seems like part and parcel of any shift in form necessarily comes with a resistance. It\u2019s kind of cool to be part of that in comedy. I expect other people to take what I\u2019ve done and bend it out of shape and create something new. And for me that\u2019s exciting.\u201d</p> <p><em>Nanette</em> could be viewed as key to Gadsby\u2019s personal and professional evolution in that she dumped self-deprecation from her set, saying on stage: \u201cDo you understand what self-deprecation means when it comes from somebody who already exists in the margins? It\u2019s not humility, it\u2019s humiliation.\u201d However, Gadsby doesn\u2019t think that <em>Nanette</em> was \u201cfearless\u201d, pointing out how she briefly refers on stage to being abused as a child, and raped as a young woman, but doesn\u2019t take it further. \u201cAs brave as <em>Nanette</em> was, it wasn\u2019t that brave,\u201d says Gadsby. \u201cI didn\u2019t say, this person I knew raped me. I couldn\u2019t say that. So I wasn\u2019t completely fearless. I made a decision. I chose a trauma that features a stranger performing violence on me. That makes it safe. I don\u2019t know how to wrangle the story on stage where I say someone betrayed me on a profound level. I don\u2019t think I did the bravest thing I possibly could have.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I live in my head. So, when I'm at home, I'm just throwing thought-orgies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gadsby wasn\u2019t ready to discuss these subjects on stage, which obviously is fine. \u201cWhen it comes to those things, I have to also look after my own trauma,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to be in control of the trauma around that before it becomes public property, I believe. And I\u2019m glad I did, because the level of attention I got with <em>Nanette</em> was truly frightening. It felt unsafe.\u201d Gadsby has made references to \u201ctrauma-porn\u201d before. I wonder if that\u2019s a danger for any performer \u2013 audiences demanding more and more, darker and darker? \u201cI think it\u2019s because people want a big narrative around things to understand it. If they don\u2019t understand it, then it didn\u2019t happen. And the danger of that is there\u2019s no straight line through trauma.\u201d</p> <p>Gadsby prefers to keep her personal life private (\u201cWith things like relationships, I\u2019m not just talking for myself any more\u201d). A couple of years ago, Gadsby was rumoured to be dating Jill Soloway, the US showrunner, director and writer, responsible for the Emmy-winning <em>Transparent</em>, who identifies as non-binary and non-gender-conforming, though by 2019, Gadsby said they weren\u2019t together.&nbsp;Gadsby tells me that, before the autism diagnosis, she couldn\u2019t maintain relationships. \u201cI was just terrible at relationships but I didn\u2019t know why until I was diagnosed,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s made me better able to trust my own boundaries. Before I was diagnosed, I had to trust other people with personal instruction. Because I didn\u2019t understand it. Relating to someone emotionally is not something I\u2019m great at. So I would trust them and it became difficult because you can\u2019t always trust other people to take care of your boundaries.\u201d</p> <p>Gadsby is at pains not to overemphasise the positives about autism. \u201cI still have to negotiate the world, and the world has been built to prioritise neurotypical people,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s still there. I\u2019ll never not have autism. What it\u2019s meant is when I close the door, and I\u2019m on my own, it\u2019s a better place.\u201d Right now, during lockdown, she\u2019s relaxing at home, mainly by gardening, or playing with her dogs. \u201cI don\u2019t sit and think. I do and think. I\u2019m always rearranging things. Or building things. I do a bit of woodwork. I garden. I\u2019m very active.\u201d Is she able to switch off fairly easily? \u201cI live in my head. So, when I\u2019m at home, I\u2019m just throwing thought-orgies.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edf584cc1ab4297de7529c4d52379746c523f5d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edf584cc1ab4297de7529c4d52379746c523f5d2/1_0_1335_801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gadsby on stage with her previous show, Nanette, which brought global attention.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gadsby on stage with her previous show, Nanette, which brought global attention.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben King/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gadsby remains concerned that too many talented women in comedy don\u2019t get the recognition they deserve. And, while she\u2019s glad that #MeToo saw the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/harvey-weinstein\">Harvey Weinstein</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/bill-cosby\">Bill Cosby</a> convicted, she doesn\u2019t feel that\u2019s the end of it: \u201cWhat needs to change is the toxic culture that enables that behaviour. These men could not have done those things without the power structures and the yes-men and the silent people around them. These are kind of cultish scenarios where good people turn a blind eye, and almost convince themselves that they didn\u2019t see it. That\u2019s a cultural thing.\u201d</p> <p>Gadsby refers to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/apr/07/sincerely-louis-ck-review-standup-comedy-me-too\">Louis CK</a> in <em>Douglas</em> (\u201cHe is like the anti-vaxx of comedy, isn\u2019t he?\u201d) . After finally admitting to repeated grave sexual misconduct, Louis CK was further criticised for attempting a comeback. \u201cHe\u2019s just digging his own grave,\u201d says Gadsby. \u201cHis whole career was built on how he liked to talk about really dangerous things. And that was what was interesting about it. That took an enormous amount of skill. And with that, the audience had to trust him. Nobody trusts him any more.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019re almost out of time. While live comedy is as affected by the coronavirus pandemic as everything else. Gadsby now has <em>Douglas</em> and <em>Nanette</em> out, and her memoir, <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ten-Steps-Nanette-Hannah-Gadsby/dp/1911630237/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3KWUETO6WLGRO&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=ten+steps+to+nanette&amp;qid=1590073740&amp;sprefix=ten+steps+to+%2Caps%2C138&amp;sr=8-1\">Ten Steps to Nanette</a></em>, is to be published next year. She tells me that, creatively, she\u2019s still driven, she still wants to take risks, she\u2019s still drawn to subjects because she wants to understand them: \u201cGenerally my thoughts are occupied with things that grab my curiosity. And that\u2019s a real privilege of success. <em>Nanette</em> changed my life,\u201d says Gadsby. \u201cIf anyone knows me, more likely than not, it\u2019s because of <em>Nanette</em>. I had a fairly small sphere of influence before <em>Nanette</em>, and now I have a large one. That has to be acknowledged. You have to acknowledge that that\u2019s how people define you. You also have to let those people accept how you define yourself.\u201d</p> <p><em>Douglas is out now on <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81054700\">Netflix</a></em></p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 2 June 2020 to correct the publication date of Hannah Gadsby\u2019s memoir</p></li> </ul>",

It featured some of their restaurant staff, who have been feeding NHS workers housed there during the current crisis, dressed as socially distanced stormtroopers, with a sign reading \u201cMay the force be with you.\u201d It made me smile. Indeed, it struck me that, despite having eaten in that dining room many times throughout its various incarnations, this was the most fun I\u2019d ever seen anyone having there.</p> <p>Ah, the hotel restaurant: the hospitality business\u2019s version of the casino slot machine.

I was charmed by the kooky sleight of hand of Heston Blumenthal\u2019s \u201cmeat fruit\u201d, the smoothest of chicken liver parfaits fashioned to look like a mandarin because it was on the menu at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/27/jay-rayner-dinner-heston-blumenthal\" title=\"\">Dinner</a> inside the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Knightsbridge.

Too often they come across as those overly tight, crotch-creviced jeans worn by your 60-year-old head teacher at the weekend: a really bad fit. One of my first experiences of a hotel restaurant in this job was at the Connaught Hotel in 2001 when it was a glowering, deep-varnished museum piece, overseen by the impeccably toqued French chef <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2001/dec/09/foodanddrink.features15\" title=\"\">Michel Bourdin</a>. I remember a terrine set in rubbery aspic flavoured with cloves, and an excruciating bill (made more so by my companion, a mighty English novelist, grandly ordering champagne for the whole table without bothering to check with the person handling the bill, ie me, that didn\u2019t all go through on expenses.) It served the kind of food ex-boarding school boys like: mushroom and quail\u2019s egg vol-au-vents, calf\u2019s liver and bacon, roast lamb and so on. The waiters came in stiff-collared waves. At the Connaught you were never alone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ee89ef7ea93b467c9ecd8f56c8dbf1414ff740d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ee89ef7ea93b467c9ecd8f56c8dbf1414ff740d/0_0_4165_3610/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pie heaven: Holborn Dining Room.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"867\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pie heaven: Holborn Dining Room.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2001, Gordon Ramsay announced he was taking over the Claridge\u2019s dining room. It was the start of a fierce land grab. He put his chefs into the Savoy and the Berkeley, the Marriott and, of course, the Connaught. Bourdin\u2019s disciples rose up as quickly as their knees would allow them, and I laughed. This, I decided, was what London needed. In many ways, it really was. In came the interior designers with their mood boards and their colour swatches. It was a thrilling moment.</p> <p>But quickly I realised these restaurants inside hotels weren\u2019t quite living up to their billing. Instead of joy, you got stiff service, the whiff of closely managed artifice and a very big bill. Ramsay wanted his Claridge\u2019s outpost to be a three-star companion to his flagship in Chelsea. It ended up feeling like his own tribute act. In too many instances the creation of what is meant to be a stand-alone restaurant with an identity separate to that of the hotel ends up as a desperate act of architectural misdirection; an attempt to convince you that the space was always meant to be this, and not the big echoing ballroom off to the left of the lobby which they didn\u2019t quite have a use for.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ebfa36b6000ad4ded1b8e3cf55a5ef92cd77b881\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebfa36b6000ad4ded1b8e3cf55a5ef92cd77b881/0_325_3907_2344/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I was thrilled\u2019: Tunworth mash at Gridiron.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I was thrilled\u2019: Tunworth mash at Gridiron.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Scanning the space occupied by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jun/02/jay-rayner-the-soak-grosvenor-hotel-inconsistent-doesnt-cover-it-pickle-ferment\" title=\"\">the Soak</a> at the Grosvenor Hotel in Victoria, I concluded the whole thing could be packed up and shifted out, re-flat-packed, in half a day.

Like Herbert Hoover, who in 1930 said \u201cthe worst is behind us\u201d as thousands starved, Trump says the economy will improve and does nothing about the growing hardship.

They are mostly about getting even.</p> \n<p>When he\u2019s not fomenting violence against black protesters, he\u2019s accusing a media personality of committing murder, retweeting slurs&nbsp;about a black female politician\u2019s weight and the House speaker\u2019s looks, conjuring up conspiracies against himself supposedly organized by Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, and encouraging his followers to \u201cliberate\u201d their states from lockdown restrictions.</p> \n<p>He tweets bogus threats that he has no power to carry out \u2013 withholding funds from states that expand absentee voting, \u201coverruling\u201d governors who don\u2019t allow places of worship to reopen \u201cright away\u201d, and punishing Twitter for factchecking him.</p> \n<p>And he lies incessantly.</p> \n<p>In reality, Donald Trump doesn\u2019t run the government of the United States. He doesn\u2019t manage anything. He doesn\u2019t organize anyone. He doesn\u2019t administer or oversee or supervise. He doesn\u2019t read memos. He hates meetings.

  "<p>There is a dreadful familiarity about the killing of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, by white police officers in Minneapolis last Monday. Floyd\u2019s final moments were videoed from a bystander\u2019s phone. He repeatedly pleads for mercy. His last words, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d, have become a rallying cry for often violent protests that have since shaken cities across America.</p> <p>The fact that the US has been here before, countless times, does not lessen the horror of this crime nor mitigate brutal police actions. Quite the opposite. It\u2019s right that all four officers involved have been sacked. One, who kept his knee pressed on the handcuffed Floyd\u2019s windpipe for several minutes even though he plainly did not pose a threat, has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/derek-chauvin-police-officer-charged-george-floyd\">charged with murder</a>.</p> <p>The widespread fury that this killing has aroused is not unprecedented. Similar eruptions followed high-profile police killings of black men, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/09/michael-brown-ferguson-death-black-men\">Michael Brown in Ferguson</a>, Missouri and Eric Garner in New York City, both in 2014. Nearly 30 years ago, rioting in Los Angeles sparked by the police beating of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rodney-king\">Rodney King</a> left 63 people dead.</p> <p>All the same, this latest incident feels dangerously different, for three reasons. One is the sense that increasingly militarised US police forces, which often appear remote from and antagonistic to the communities they serve, have not learned the lessons of the past. This despite ardent campaigning by groups such as <a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/\">Black Lives Matter</a> and the greater prominence of black people in public life.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This was a multiracial protest representing what is best in America against what was, in effect, a modern-day lynching</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>African Americans comprise 12% of the US population. But according to <a href=\"https://thesocietypages.org/toolbox/police-killing-of-blacks/\">data for 2015-19</a>, they accounted for 26.4% of those killed by police in all circumstances. Put another way, black people are three times more likely to be killed by police than white people, who form 61% of the population. While this is not a new problem, the repeated, systemic failure to fix it has become critical.</p> <p>A second exacerbating factor is Donald Trump and the unvanquished white supremacist thinking he personifies. This vile legacy has deep roots in an originally pro-slavery constitution, the blood myths of the confederacy, and <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/09/26/american-immigration-century-racism/\">late 19th-century Nordicism</a>, eugenics and nativism, the period when the slogan \u201cAmerica First\u201d was coined.</p> <p>When Trump tweets menacingly about \u201clooting and shooting\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">as he did last week</a>, or mocks \u201cshithole countries\u201d in Africa, expresses a preference for migrants from Norway, and describes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/19/tracking-trump-charlottesville-bannon-worst-week\">Charlottesville neo-Nazis</a> as \u201cvery fine people\u201d, he echoes an ingrained, bigoted belief among some white people that black people are inferior \u2013 indeed, that black lives don\u2019t matter.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s behaviour has been predictably irresponsible and inflammatory. While mayors from Minneapolis to Atlanta and Portland struggled to maintain order, rightly shaming those who used the Floyd tragedy to indulge in theft and arson, Trump\u2019s main concern was to look tough in front of his mostly white base. He can kiss goodbye to the black vote in November.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e75672c2879f6f636662ab5d35ea27636e1cb323\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e75672c2879f6f636662ab5d35ea27636e1cb323/0_180_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kneeling protesters in face masks observe a moment of silence in Minneapolis\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters observe a moment of silence during the fourth day of protests in Minneapolis after the killing of George Floyd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicholas Pfosi/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many other voter groups, including the Latinx and Asian communties, may also have been alienated. The demonstrators, most of whom acted lawfully, came from a range of racial and ethnic backgrounds, including white people. This was a multiracial protest representing what is best in America against what was, in effect, a modern-day lynching.</p> <p>The angry explosion was also a reaction to the societal stresses caused by the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 a third reason why this new episode in America\u2019s unending racial conflicts is different. The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-racism-african-americans.html\">disproportionate impact</a> of the virus on black people, in terms of death and infection rates, has unforgettably dramatised the corrosive inequality at the heart of American society.</p> <p>These protests will eventually cease. But injustice, bigotry and social malaise will not \u2013 not until all Americans want it.</p>",

elsewhere from 8 June, despite a record high number of cases detected nationwide on Saturday, Reuters reports.</p> \n  <p>The home ministry ordered state governments and local authorities to identify \u201ccontainment zones\u201d, or areas that should remain under lockdown, as they continue to report high number of infections. <br></p> \n  <p>Hospitality and retail sectors, as well as places of worship, are allowed to open from 8 June, while the government expects local authorities to ensure physical distancing rules and staggered business hours. <br></p> \n  <p>India reported a record daily

infections. <br></p> \n  <p>Restrictions on international air travel and city train services remain in place, but permission for intra-state travel was granted. <br></p> \n  <p>Individual states are

He suggested up to 80% of those looting and setting fire to buildings were from other places.</p> <p>\u201cThe situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great city.\u201d</p> <p>Peggy Flanagan, the lieutenant governor, blamed those she said do not have the community\u2019s interests at heart.</p> <p>\u201cThere are white supremacists there.

Other community leaders blamed those they said were intent on overthrowing the government.

Young white people dressed in black, who at times did not seem to know their way around the city, were among the most aggressive with the police. They worked in groups, and spray-painted the most political graffiti, beyond the calls for justice for George Floyd or the ubiquitous \u201cFuck the police\u201d.</p> <p>But blaming ideological agitators is also politically convenient, not least because Walz was severely embarrassed by the failure of the police and national guard to enforce a curfew he said would end the destruction.</p> <p>It is also untrue.</p> <p>Very large numbers of people attacking buildings and looting were from the city, if not from the Lake Street neighbourhood that suffered most. They were not there to overthrow anything. Many seemed more intent on dragging home the contents of Target or the liquor store, or just venting their anger by taking it out on panes of glass.</p> <p>As the protests have swirled around south Minneapolis, different groups have stood out. The young white people working in clusters, frequently wearing backpacks. Local people, many African American but also whites and Latinos, who are there to keep the focus firmly on the demand for justice for George Floyd, and particularly a call for the arrest of all the officers involved in his death. And groups of mainly young men, both black and white, who lead the looting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a836c2b8bd0f26ee7ceb40f48f805a8f934b477c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a836c2b8bd0f26ee7ceb40f48f805a8f934b477c/0_100_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People loot and burn the Target store near the Minneapolis police third precinct.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People loot and burn the Target store near the Minneapolis police third precinct.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Bettcher/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sometimes they protest together. Those the governor called anarchists were often seen alongside the men smashing up shops, but did not necessarily stay to plunder. Protesters looking for justice rallied alongside the young white crowd dressed in black outside the fifth precinct police station.</p> <p>If there was some well-coordinated scheme to take apart Minneapolis, there was also a considerable amount of opportunism by large numbers of people who couldn\u2019t believe their luck. Some arrived in cars with Minnesota license plates to load up with goods from Target. A line of vehicles drew up at the liquor store to sling in cases of beer and spirits. Others wheeled away what they could in shopping trolleys.</p> <p>What is different in the city is the scale of the destruction.</p> <p>While the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, six years ago over the police killing of Michael Brown involved some looting and burning of buildings, mostly they centred around nightly face-offs with the police.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/30/policing-in-the-us-is-not-about-enforcing-law-its-about-enforcing-white-supremacy\">Policing in the US is not about enforcing law.

Scores of shops and businesses were destroyed, and many more damaged, as barely a block went unscathed. In parts, entire rows of shops were razed by fire. Other places escaped with no more than broken windows.</p> <p>Gas stations, banks and auto parts stores were burned to the ground. Sprawling retail stores were comprehensively plundered. Pharmacies were a favoured target. But many of the stores hit were small family-owned concerns. Barbers, restaurants, electronics dealers, a car wash.</p> <p>The raiding of a large liquor store helped turn the riot into a party for some, as music blared and cars drag raced along Lake Street.</p>"
