Confirmed infections are nearing 3.4 million, with 6,378,239 so dar.</li> <li><strong>Brazil deaths passed 30,000. </strong>A record 1,262 Covid-19 deaths have been recorded in Brazil today - taking the country\u2019s total death toll to 31,199 - but the president continues to downplay the pandemic. The figures were announced on Tuesday evening by Brazil\u2019s health ministry, which also said the number of coronavirus cases had risen to 555,383, second only to the United States. The South American country is now on the verge of overtaking Italy, where 33,530 deaths have been recorded, as the country with the third highest number of deaths.</li> <li><strong>Australia\u2019s economy is in recession. </strong>Australian treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has confirmed Australia is now in a recession as the economy reels from the coronavirus pandemic. His confirmation came after the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2020/jun/03/coronavirus-australia-latest-updates-unions-employers-industrial-relations-jobs-covid-19-nsw-queensland-victoria-travel-borders-restrictions-live-news?page=with:block-5ed6fdaa8f087122eca54777#block-5ed6fdaa8f087122eca54777\">economy shrank by 0.3% in the March quarter</a>, on the back of the bushfires, drought and coronavirus pandemic. Asked whether the country was now in recession, he said: \u201cWell, the answer to that is \u2018yes\u2019. And that is on the basis of the advice that I have from the Treasury department about where the June quarter is expected to be.\u201d</li> <li><strong>New Zealand saw its 12th consecutive day with no new cases. </strong>New Zealand has reported a 12th straight day of no new cases of Covid-19, as the government considers abandoning as early as next week all remaining restrictions on the country except stringent border controls. Just one person in New Zealand is still recovering from the illness, health officials said on Wednesday. They are not in hospital. There have been fewer than 1,500 confirmed cases of the virus in the country, with 22 deaths.</li> <li><strong>French anti-racism protesters defied a coronavirus gathering ban. </strong>Clashes broke out between police and protesters in Paris on Tuesday after around 20,000 people defied a ban to rally over the 2016 death of a black man in police custody, galvanised by US demonstrations against racism and deadly police violence. <br></li> <li><strong>China\u2019s service sector is bouncing back. </strong>China\u2019s huge service sector has bounced back to growth for the first time since January in a sign that the world\u2019s second largest economy is recovering strongly from strict coronavirus-induced containment measures. Although employment and overseas demand remains weak in the economy, the Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers\u2019 index rose to 55.0 in May from 44.4 in April, hitting the highest level since late 2010. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. </li> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/yemen-faces-macabre-tragedy-as-aid-funding-falls-short-by-1bn\">Yemen aid funding falls short by US$1bn</a>. </strong>Yemen remains on the brink of \u201ca macabre tragedy\u201d, the UN has warned after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/saudi-arabia-to-co-host-un-fundraising-summit-for-yemen\">a humanitarian fundraising summit</a> raised only $1.35bn for this year, around $1bn short of the target and only half the sum raised at the equivalent pledging conference last year. Dr Abdullah al-Rabiah, the head of the King Salman Centre for Relief and Humanitarian Aid in Saudi Arabia, which co-hosted the virtual summit, put the overall shortfall down to the impact of coronavirus on national budgets and concerns about the restrictions on aid flows imposed by the parties to Yemen\u2019s five-year civil war.</li> <li><strong>Hopes were raised of the possible availability of a vaccine.</strong> A senior US army researcher said it was reasonable to expect that some sort of vaccine could be available to some parts of the US population by the end of the year.</li> <li><strong>France\u2019s death toll rose by more than a 100 in a 24-hour period for the first time in 13 days.</strong> It came as the country enacts a new easing of lockdown measures.</li> <li><strong>Iran confirmed its second highest number of new cases in a 24-hour period </strong>since its outbreak began, with the health ministry saying 3,117 people tested positive. The number of new daily infections in Iran has now returned to levels previously seen at the peak of its outbreak in late March.</li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s travel warning for Europe will be lifted on Wednesday, </strong>its foreign minister, Heiko Maas, announced. The worldwide travel warning still applies. But, for the countries of the EU and associated states, the warning will be replaced by travel advice that will give travellers detailed information about the situation in each state.</li> <li><strong> </strong><strong>The UK\u2019s official death toll passed 50,000, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics</strong>. The total differs from the government\u2019s daily counts, which only include deaths in hospitals and care homes where the person had tested positive.</li> <li><strong>The UK statistics watchdog criticised the government\u2019s testing data. </strong>Whitehall\u2019s use of testing data <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-live-news-dr-fauci-says-he-hasnt-spoken-to-trump-in-two-weeks-as-pakistanis-told-to-live-with-virus?page=with:block-5ed61f598f087122eca53e97#block-5ed61f598f087122eca53e97\">appears to be aimed more at making it look like a lot is being done</a> than actually painting a clear picture, the chairman of the UK Statistics Authority warned the health secretary, Matt Hancock.</li> <li><strong>A Wuhan doctor who worked with the whistleblower Li Wenliang died of the virus last week</strong>, Chinese state media reported.

He expressed outrage at the militarisation of the administration\u2019s response to mass protests over the police killing of George Floyd.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI have watched this week\u2019s unfolding events, angry and appalled,\u201d he said.</p> <p>His statement, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/06/james-mattis-denounces-trump-protests-militarization/612640/\">published by the Atlantic magazine,</a> came on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-mark-esper-opposes-trump-threat-deploy-military\">day of confusion</a> and discord in the Trump administration over the role of the military.&nbsp;Mattis\u2019s successor as defence secretary, Mark Esper, had contradicted Trump over the president\u2019s threatened invocation of the 1807 Insurrection Act to deploy active duty troops on US streets.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-mark-esper-opposes-trump-threat-deploy-military\">Pentagon chief opposes Trump threat to deploy military at protests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Esper had ordered elite airborne troops, flown to the Washington outskirts on Monday,&nbsp;back to their bases on Wednesday, but then reversed that order hours later after a visit to the White House.</p> <p>The defence secretary had also sought to distance himself from a presidential publicity stunt on Monday, in which Trump had protesters cleared from Lafayette Park, a public area in front of the White House, so that he could be photographed outside a church that had been partially burned the previous day.</p> <p>In his statement on Wednesday evening, Mattis said: \u201cDonald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people \u2013 does not even pretend to try. Instead he tries to divide us. We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership.\u201d</p> <p>The former defence secretary added: \u201cWe know that we are better than the abuse of executive authority that we witnessed in Lafayette Park. We must reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our constitution.\u201d</p> <p>Mattis recalled the distinction between US forces and the Nazis fighting on the Normandy beaches in 1944. The Nazi slogan was \u201cDivide and conquer\u201d while the American response was \u201cIn union there is strength\u201d.</p> <p>Mattis\u2019s dramatic and long-awaited intervention comes at a time when Trump appeared to be at a crossroads in his response to the protests. The White House signaled its displeasure with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-mark-esper-opposes-trump-threat-deploy-military\">Esper\u2019s rejection of the Insurrection Act </a>and his efforts to distance himself from Trump\u2019s actions.

Snap also published a lengthy email that its chief executive, Evan Spiegel, sent to staff on Sunday in response to the alleged police murder of George Floyd and the protests that have erupted around the country.</p> <p>After discussing his own experience learning about racism and injustice, Spiegel telegraphed the action against Trump\u2019s account, writing: \u201cWe may continue to allow divisive people to maintain an account on Snapchat, as long as the content that is published on Snapchat is consistent with our community guidelines, but we will not promote that account or content in any way \u2026&nbsp;We will make it clear with our actions that there is no grey area when it comes to racism, violence, and injustice \u2013 and we will not promote it, nor those who support it, on our platform.\u201d</p> <p>Snap\u2019s decision will likely increase pressure on the Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, who has come under intense criticism from civil rights leaders and Facebook employees over his decision to allow Trump\u2019s threat that \u201cwhen the looting starts the shooting starts\u201d remain on the platform.

  "<p>For the second time in a week, Dominic Cummings is incurring the wrath of Tory backbenchers: this time over No 10\u2019s belated decision to impose a quarantine on travellers who come to the UK.</p> <p>After withstanding the fury of Conservative MPs over his lockdown road trips last week, they are now on the warpath against Cummings since the controversial imposition of 14-day blanket quarantine requirement for those entering the country from abroad.</p> <p>Not only are the backbench malcontents questioning the scientific and economic basis for imposing it, but they are having to field queries from annoyed constituents. They have heard government messaging about the easing of restrictions \u2013 and now want to know if they can go on holiday.</p> <p>Even some cabinet ministers, such as Grant Shapps, are believed to have argued for the idea of \u201cair bridges\u201d \u2013 reciprocal arrangements with other countries that have similar infection rates that would allow for quarantine to be waived.</p> <p>For the time being, the quarantine policy has won.</p> <p>Both Boris Johnson and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/priti-patel-urged-to-publish-scientific-advice-behind-uk-quarantine-move\">Priti Patel, the home secretary, robustly defended it </a>on Wednesday, saying it was essential to bring down the risk of new infections from abroad.</p> <p>However, they didn\u2019t get much help from the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, who refused to say that the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies endorsed a blanket quarantine policy for all travellers. Instead, he said only that \u201cmeasures like this are most effective&nbsp;when the number of cases is very low in this country and when applied to countries from higher rates\u201d.</p> <p>To add to the general sense of confusion, the Daily Mail \u2013 highly hostile to the quarantine idea \u2013 reported on Wednesday that it was Cummings\u2019 pet plan that had been briefed to the Times newspaper as a \u201cdead cat\u201d to distract from the care homes crisis. A No 10 source rubbished that suggestion, saying it was untrue and that the policy was in circulation long before that point. The Times did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>With its majority of 80 and just six months after an election, Johnson\u2019s government is supposed to be still in its honeymoon phase. But the mood of the backbenchers no longer feels that way. Many Tory MPs \u2013 especially those with a libertarian bent \u2013 are clamouring for a quicker easing of the lockdown, with the quarantine revolt a sign they are unhappy with any new stricter measures that have economic consequences.</p> <p>At the same time, there is a sense of unease about whether their own government is sufficiently competent \u2013 something exploited this week by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, with his accusation that Johnson is \u201cwinging it\u201d and needs to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/keir-starmer-puts-boris-johnson-on-notice-over-handling-of-coronavirus-cummings-labour\">\u201cget a grip\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Backbenchers have watched and defended the government as it has been accused of bungling the timing of the lockdown, the distribution of personal protective equipment, the decision to stop community testing for the virus, the failure to produce a track and trace app, and the belated quarantine.</p> <p>But the postbags from their constituents complaining of Cummings\u2019 behaviour during the lockdown has felt for many Conservative MPs like the last straw that caused them to break ranks and criticise one of the most senior people at the heart of the government.</p> <p>Many have no love for Cummings \u2013 and most have told constituents they have never met or spoken to the aide \u2013 and they are already seizing on his moment of weakness to undermine some the policies that No 10 espouses, including the quarantine for travellers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/03/the-guardian-view-on-governing-after-lockdown-boris-johnsons-grip-is-weak\">The Guardian view on governing after lockdown: Boris Johnson's grip is weak | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The sense of a government not entirely in control of events has been exacerbated by Johnson\u2019s sporadic invisibility, amid regular speculation he has yet to fully recover from his very serious bout of Covid-19. On Tuesday, No 10 announced a new plan for the Downing Street press briefings, which will go from daily to five days a week \u2013 but with Johnson due to lead only one.</p> <p>No 10 is once again launching a fightback against this perception of drift, with its overhauled system of ministerial committees to tackle the crisis. But there is a familiar feel to the messaging that Johnson is taking back control \u2013 an idea that surfaced when he was under pressure to order a lockdown and then again after his illness.</p> <p>Tory backbenchers have already forced a U-turn this week on the new arrangements for a return to physically voting in parliament, with the government now allowing proxy votes for the most at risk. They are also flexing their muscles over the Huawei decision, applying pressure on No 10 to phase out the Chinese company from the 5G network as soon as possible.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s defence of the quarantine plans at his daily press conference shows he is not backing down on that just yet, but the signs are there that it may not last for long before being replaced with another solution \u2013 mostly likely the \u201cair corridors\u201d or screening at airports.</p> <p>At that point, it is likely to be added to the growing list of policies that the government has mishandled over the course of the epidemic, giving another reason for concern among Tory MPs that Johnson has not been at the top of his game during this crisis and a sense that Cummings is not unassailable.</p>",

Next was a trip to Southampton in early September in which he struck a first hat-trick for the club, despite missing a penalty via an attempted chip with Saints 2-1 ahead.</p> <p>Kelvin Davies, the Southampton goalkeeper who saved the spot-kick, says: \u201cI got a sense he was going to try something different, something clever maybe.

  "<h2>Curtailment scenarios</h2> <p>This is the big one, the likely source of most friction. There is a strong will among the clubs to complete the season but what if factors beyond anybody\u2019s control make that impossible? How to determine the final standings and, most contentiously, rule on relegation? A contingency plan must be put in place. The Premier League favours an unweighted points-per-game model but however it is decided, it will be a brutally hard way to go down \u2013 if it comes to it. There is a lobby for relegation to be scrapped, driven principally by the clubs in peril, but it is difficult to see how that could happen. The FA has made it clear that it is against voiding relegation, while the notion would be at odds with existing agreements with the Football League and broadcasters.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/jun/03/neutral-venue-option-assumes-that-football-fans-are-inherently-disorderly\">Neutral venue option assumes that football fans are inherently disorderly | Owen West</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Broadcast proposals</h2> <p>There was frustration when the clubs were told they would lose between \u00a3300m and \u00a3350m in broadcast revenues even if they were able to finish the season. This was because they would not be able to fulfil certain contractual obligations in terms of the delivery of the product. There had been suggestions that the figure could be negotiable but it is not and the final bill will be \u00a3330m \u2013 with additional penalties of \u00a335m per week after 25-26 July if there are further delays. It will be repaid in instalments over the next two years and remains preferable to the loss of \u00a3762m, which would be demanded if the season were to be curtailed. The clubs will be asked to sign off on proposals to enhance broadcaster access on matchdays \u2013 features such as a camera and microphone to capture the coin toss and a camera in the tunnel. Dressing-room cameras and half-time interviews appear to be off the table.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Squad management</h2> <p>This is the umbrella term for problems such as squad registrations and player contracts. The clubs will discuss and vote on whether to allow the return of players who were injured in January and omitted from the 25-man lists \u2013 this would most likely involve an increase to the squad size limits. An example is Newcastle\u2019s Paul Dummett, who damaged a hamstring on 11 January and was left off the list but is now fit again. \u201cThe manager and the club are hopeful that the rules will be relaxed and changed,\u201d Dummett said. What will not be allowed is the inclusion of returning loanees, or summer signings such as Chelsea\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/12/chelsea-agree-40m-deal-to-sign-hakim-ziyech-from-ajax-in-summer\">Hakim Ziyech</a>. Clubs have been given until 23 June to agree extensions with players whose contracts expire on 30 June.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/2020/jun/03/premier-league-in-form-players-before-lockdown\">Premier League: the 10 most in-form players before lockdown</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Matchday manpower</h2> <p>With so many games to be crammed into a short period and after such a long break, there are worries over whether the players will be able to handle the physical demands. Hence the proposal to extend the number of permitted substitutions to five and a push, led by Chelsea, to increase the number of players on the bench to nine. This will be voted on, with some of the smaller clubs worried it could offer an advantage to those with deeper reserves.</p> <h2>Fixture list</h2> <p>The preferred framework for the remaining league matches was agreed by the clubs last Thursday. In broad terms, they want to use six weekends and three midweeks to get the season finished by 25 or 26 July. This does not include Manchester City v Arsenal and Aston Villa v Sheffield United on 17 June, which will be the reopening night. The league\u2019s football operations team have tried to allocate matches to specific dates, bearing in mind that the various slots are to be spread across each week, with action every day, and also attempting to factor in the interests of broadcasters and safety advisory groups. The priority has been to respect the guidance that teams should not play twice in 48 hours. It has been difficult and there are sure to be complaints \u2013&nbsp;but the hope is that the schedule will be signed off.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Neutral venues</h2> <p>This item has felt like a constant for weeks. At one point it seemed like a prerequisite to the season resuming, with police worried about fans turning up outside their clubs\u2019 grounds and resources being stretched. Then it faded from the agenda before returning to take in a small number of high-risk games. It will be raised once more, although the preference of the clubs is clear: they want to finish the season playing home and away. It should be noted that the final decision on venues is not theirs to make, but rather local authorities in conjunction with safety advisory groups. Some club executives think neutral grounds ought to remain as a contingency option.</p>",

Obviously in normal circumstances the Guardian is never wrong, but on the basis of what happened at PMQs today it is not clear that anything much has changed. At PMQs Starmer has consistently presented himself as the most reasonable person at the dispatch box (more on that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/29/uk-coronavirus-live-priti-patel-questions-response-covid-19-crisis-pmqs-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ea970fa8f0853abef659a0a#block-5ea970fa8f0853abef659a0a\">here</a>, including why it worked for another opposition leader) and today he won the \u201ctalking sense\u201d competition quite comfortably.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t as if the questions were, on their own, especially memorable. But Starmer does tend to specialise in loaded questions to which there is no safe or easy answer (\u201cwhen did you stop beating your wife?\u201d questions, as I think they are known at the bar), and Johnson has yet to develop any plausible response mechanism. At their last PMQs he tried responding with promises (the \u201cworld-beating\u201d test and trace system). We had a flash of that from Johnson at PMQs later, when he pledged to ensure all test results are turned around with 24 hours by the end of the month (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/03/uk-coronavirus-live-keir-starmer-boris-johnson-lockdown-easing-pmqs-covid-19-latest-updates-news?page=with:block-5ed786cd8f084df971c8edc7#block-5ed786cd8f084df971c8edc7\"> 12.19pm </a>\u2013 there may well be some clarification of quite what this involves at the lobby briefing later) but mostly, in his exchanges with Starmer, Johnson resorted to criticising the opposition leader for \u2013 well, opposing the government. He accused Starmer of launching \u201cendless attacks on public trust and confidence\u201d and of \u201ccasting aspersions\u201d on the good character of people working on test and trace (some of whom are spending much of their time watching Netflix because they don\u2019t have enough to do, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52904433\">if BBC News is to be believed)</a>.</p> <p>This is a lame form of parliamentary defence at the best times.

And it suggests that 21% of people say they are following lockdown rules less strictly than before - with a third of those saying that\u2019s at least partly because of Dominic Cummings.</p> <p>Here is the chart.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a620dac087420c31be77a80f62781da5874f1668\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a620dac087420c31be77a80f62781da5874f1668/0_0_1868_1430/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Polling on lockdown\" width=\"1000\" height=\"766\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Polling on lockdown</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YouGov</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As <strong>Chris Curtis</strong> explains in <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/health/articles-reports/2020/06/03/one-five-have-started-breaking-lockdown-rules-more\">a commentary for the YouGov website</a>, Cummings\u2019 excursion to Barnard Castle is not the only factor that might explain why people are taking the lockdown rules less seriously. Curtis says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Those advising the government had always suggested that people would become less observant of the rules as time goes on, which was one of the reasons for delaying lockdown in the first place.</p> <p>We have also seen an increase in the proportion of the public who think the situation is getting better, from 58% to 76% in two weeks, which might also be making some less cautious.</p> </blockquote> <p>Another factor might be ambiguity in the wording. The polling was carried out on Thursday last week and, when people were asked what they had done in the past week, 21% said they had followed the lockdown rules less strictly than previously. When the same question was asked at the end of April, only 5% gave that answer. But by Thursday last week the lockdown rules were less strict than they had been anyway and so some of those 21% may just be people transitioning from obeying the old rules to the new ones.</p> <p>Still, any evidence that people are taking socially distancing less seriously should be worrying. The documents released by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies repeatedly stress that easing the lockdown is only safe if people continue to comply with restrictions like the two-metre rule. For example, this is what\u2019s Sage\u2019s scientific pandemic influenza group on modelling (SPI-M-O) said in <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/888759/S0313_SAGE33_Consensus_for_SPI-M_on_transition_strategies.pdf\">a consensus view (pdf)</a> dated 4 May.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Behavioural changes in the levels of adherence rates are critically important, likely more so than the exact policies implemented, in determining whether the reproduction number remains below 1.

  "<p>Two homeless men in Spike Lee\u2019s film who inhabit a shabby street corner fear for their lives, although there is no visible threat. They joke and banter, but terror buzzes beneath the repartee. One keeps vigil while the other sleeps.

This film steers closer to realism and everyday despair. It is devastating to watch in light of Floyd\u2019s death but also because Lee emphatically points up a connection between fiction and life. Recorded on the stage of the <a href=\"https://www.steppenwolf.org/\">Steppenwolf theatre in Chicago</a>, it begins not in Moses and Kitch\u2019s dramatic world but at one remove, with footage of black people boarding a bus to the theatre and passing the street sign that is later replicated on the stark stage set.</p> <p>At times, Pass Over deploys the usual illusions of film but Lee\u2019s camera also shows its mechanics.&nbsp;As the drama plays out, there are shots of the live theatre audience that pan across their faces in closeup as gunfire crackles, the white, all-American \u201cgood\u201d citizen, Mister (Ryan Hallahan), bares his wolf\u2019s teeth, or a white police officer, played by Blake DeLong, utters a racial obscenity, before swinging back to the stage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd2768fd71ba47aa6a986e6886f7020c8eadb20c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd2768fd71ba47aa6a986e6886f7020c8eadb20c/0_0_4556_2736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pass Over stars Julian Parker and Jon Michael Hill.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pass Over stars Julian Parker and Jon Michael Hill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amazon Prime VIdeo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is clear that Lee\u2019s fiction is in dialogue with the world beyond it, and that he is inviting his audience to join the dots, too. This meta aspect might easily have felt laboured in lesser hands but is deft and dramatic here;&nbsp;the audience is woven into the greater drama without being objectified. The closing segment shows&nbsp;members of&nbsp;the audience again, smiling and posing with their&nbsp;families outside&nbsp;the auditorium, their&nbsp;faces lovingly framed&nbsp;by the camera. It&nbsp;captures, too, the poverty, housing projects and nondescript&nbsp;city street corners&nbsp;well beyond&nbsp;the theatre, which draw our thoughts to real-world proximities in the fiction we have just seen.</p> <p>If&nbsp;Pass Over&nbsp;feels pertinent now, it also points to the sad historical circularity of white-on-black police violence. Kitch&nbsp;mentions the dead black men of the neighbourhood again and again. Both men also refer to the \u201cplantation\u201d and there is a dismal timelessness to the racial oppression they face: \u201cSame shit \u2026 just the date has changed,\u201d says Moses.&nbsp;</p> <p>As a drama,&nbsp;Pass Over&nbsp;is a masterful tragedy.

Lovers Rock features Blue Story\u2019s Micheal Ward in 1980s-set romance. While Cannes has in the past been reluctant to select made-for-television work, it has recently shown David Lynch\u2019s Twin Peaks and Nicolas Winding Refn\u2019s Too Old to Die Young.</p> <p>McQueen said in a statement: \u201cI dedicate these films to George Floyd and all the other black people that have been murdered, seen or unseen, because of who they are, in the US, UK and elsewhere. \u2018If you are the big tree, we are the small axe.\u2019 Black Lives Matter.\u201d</p> <p>Although the selection appears noticeably short of major Hollywood names \u2013 with studios clearly preferring to hedge their bets and keep product back till the post-pandemic situation is clearer - Cannes has the Kate Winslet/Saoirse Ronan starrer Ammonite, directed by British film-maker Francis Lee. Ammonite centres on real-life fossil hunter Mary Anning&nbsp;(played by Winslet) who lived in Lyme Regis in the early 19th century; Ronan plays a wealthy married woman with whom she develops a relationship.</p> <p>Cannes has also selected Soul, the new animated film from Pixar, directed by Pete Docter which features Jamie Foxx as a jazz musician whose soul separates from his body, while Falling, the directorial debut of Lord of the Rings\u2019 Viggo Mortensen, has been added to the line-up after its successful premiere at Sundance earlier this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55cb27b7c9dd48da5ed76b20b7b9153c21ee9491\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55cb27b7c9dd48da5ed76b20b7b9153c21ee9491/156_0_4290_2574/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pixar\u2019s Soul.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pixar\u2019s Soul.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pixar/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other highlights are Aya and the Witch, a new Studio Ghibli animation from Japan, directed by animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s son Goro and adapted from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2012/apr/14/review-earwig-witch-wynne-jones\">British kids book Earwig and the Witch by&nbsp;Diana Wynne Jones</a>, and Limbo, a Scottish-set film about refugees directed by Ben Sharrock and produced by FilmFour.</p> <p>After it had to call off its gala event Cannes has, unlike other festivals, resisted calls to construct a \u201cvirtual\u201d festival online. It intends to present its selection at prominent festivals later in the calendar year, including the Toronto, San Sebastian, Telluride and Venice film festivals.</p> <p>Having faced criticism in recent years for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/10/cannes-festival-adapts-metoo-era-gender-issues-remain\">paucity of female directors in Cannes\u2019 main competition</a>, with only three selected in each of the last three years in a row, Fr\u00e9maux defended Cannes\u2019 record by saying the 16 female directors in total selected this year (compared to 14 last year, and 11 in 2018) represented an \u201can evolution observed for several years\u201d. He added: \u201cIt testifies, in number and in value, to the artistic and human contribution of women in contemporary cinema.\u201d </p> <p>Among the crop of female directors for 2020 are Ma\u00efwenn, Charl\u00e8ne Favier and Naomi Kawase but as the new selection does not break down films into the traditional categories, direct comparison to previous years is not possible. </p> <p>The 73rd festival was due to take place between 12-23 May, but after restrictions by French government effectively banned mass gatherings until mid-July at the earliest it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/14/cannes-film-festival-says-2020-edition-cannot-go-ahead-in-original-form\">forced to call it off</a>, before subsequently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/11/cannes-abandons-physical-festival-for-2020-but-will-select-films-for-screening-elsewhere?hss_channel=tw-8740252\">abandoning tentative plans to reschedule it</a> for later in the year.

As someone who cycled for many years, mainly to and from work in London, I have picked up a few further tips.</p> <p>First, never wear earphones when cycling. You must listen as well as look at what\u2019s happening around you, and plugging up your ears shuts out important sounds. Portable radios can be attached to your handlebars, the sound of which melds in with everything else, and I did not find mine distracting.</p> <p>Second, never cross from one side of a road to the other, however minor the road is; always dismount and push your bike.</p> <p>Third, never sit on the inside of a lorry at traffic lights, even though lorries now must have mirrors for seeing you. Always hold back and sit beside a car, which will have plenty of windows.</p> <p>Lastly, when cycling along a main road, where a vehicle is waiting in a side road on your left to pull out into the traffic, take control of your speed, slow down and make eye contact with the driver. If they have seen you they will make eye contact with you naturally. If there is no eye contact, be ready to pull up in case they pull out across you. <br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Margaret Davis</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Loanhead, Midlothian</em></p> <p>\u2022 I was disappointed that Claire Armistead\u2019s article made no mention of using a bell. It seems ridiculous that it is compulsory for a bell to be fitted when you buy a bike, but it may then be removed when cycling on the road or cycle paths.</p> <p>As a daily cyclist on streets with narrow pavements and shared cycle paths, I strongly feel that all bicycles should by law carry a bell. I use mine constantly when coming up behind people who look as if they may walk into the road to overtake somebody on the pavement, or groups on cycle paths. I often smile and apologise to avoid any bad feeling. </p> <p>Hopefully cycling will now become a more acceptable way of getting to work or school, but we must make it safe and practical.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Jane Harding</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Winchester</em></p> <p>\u2022 Claire Armistead\u2019s advice is on the money.

  "<p>A landmark court judgment that a government forestry agency repeatedly breached conservation regulations has sparked calls for a review of an industry-wide exemption for logging under national environment laws.</p> <p>Last week the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/27/vicforests-breached-forestry-agreement-with-central-highlands-logging-court-rules\">federal court found</a> VicForests, a body owned by Victorian taxpayers, breached a code of practice in a <a href=\"https://www.agriculture.gov.au/forestry/policies/rfa\">regional forestry agreement (RFA)</a> between the federal and state governments covering the state\u2019s central highlands.</p> <p>It means for the first time in 20 years, forestry operations may have to be assessed under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act.

It was insular, dense music far removed from the overseas boardroom meetings that dictated the glossy, soulless sounds of American radio. Bad//Dreems recorded their first two records with Mark Opitz, who produced classics by Cold Chisel, INXS and AC/DC, and while his fingerprints seem to mark this new release, the song was in fact put down live in a dive studio in Hackney during a UK tour. Whatever the recording location, there\u2019s no mistaking the sunburnt sound throughout, with sonic nods towards the Scientists, Radio Birdman, the Saints, and other early Australian punk, in both the dishevelled delivery and ragged-yet-tight musicianship.</p> <p><strong>For more:</strong> Check out their third album Doomsday Ballet, released last October.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/03/jack-colwell-swandream-review-\">Jack Colwell: Swandream review \u2013 theatrical, raw songs packed with pain and soaring survival</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Sia \u2013 Together</h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>Rihanna, Ariana Grande, Motown</p> <p>Sia Furler has spent the past few years lending her quirky speaking voice to animated films such as My Little Pony and Peter Rabbit, which goes some way to explaining her slowed-down music schedule of late. The Adelaide artist hasn\u2019t been otherwise idle: she has simply been shooting her feature directorial debut, Music, which stars Kate Hudson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/07/sia-ethics-of-fame-and-maddie-ziegler-a-question-i-have-asked-myself-often\">Furler\u2019s proxy Maddie Ziegler</a>, and promises 10 new Sia songs to boot. Together is the first taste of this coming windfall; a bright and inspirational pop tune that speaks of rainbows, angels, and Stevie Wonder in the lyrics, quotes the Lion King for kicks, and finds Sia leading a choir of children, Pied Piper style, through a schoolyard chant of a chorus. The song was co-written by Jack Antonoff, whose recent work with Lana Del Rey, Lorde and Taylor Swift has made him the most sought-after collaborator in pop; it\u2019s no surprise he and Furler have an easy chemistry here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79ae49ae9ef768d698f3a06754237e378f502762\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79ae49ae9ef768d698f3a06754237e378f502762/0_209_3312_1987/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sia Furler\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sia Furler and Maddie Ziegler.

This is most successfully realised on the band\u2019s 2011 classic Zonoscope, a psychotropic record with a 60s sound, sharpened with 80s technology, and mastered for an iPod. Whereas Cut Copy\u2019s most popular songs seem to turn on a dime, arrangement-wise, Love Is All We Share laconically lingers for a luxurious six minutes, beds of analogue keys hugging half-asleep vocals imploring us to pay attention to our universal similarities rather than focus on our differences \u2013 a song for the times if ever there was one. Cut Copy have been sitting on this track for a year, but given the current climate, it seems like the breath of air we deserve right now.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Cut Copy\u2019s sixth album will be out sometime in 2020.</p> <h2>Washington \u2013 Dark Parts</h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>Kylie Minogue, the Cardigans, the Dissociatives</p> <p>With each release, Washington has strayed further into glossy pop territory, discarding her piano-led indie songs for lush production pieces that favour dark synths, frenetic rhythms, and shifting song structures. Dark Parts is a strong statement of intent: a disorienting time signature at odds with dancefloors, computer-warped harmonies that sound like a robotic Tony Robbins, keys that drunkenly wobble and sway. There\u2019s no discerning hook for a while, relying instead on a rhythmic and hypnotic vocal to hammer its way into your skull. Then a rush of 80s synths flutter in, and Washington unleashes an earworm chorus that is up there with her very finest moments. By the beautifully shimmering bridge breakdown you\u2019ll be spellbound, your finger hovering above the \u201crepeat\u201d button, your brain needing to hear more.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Check out the video for the song, hand-drawn and animated by Megan Washington.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPa8jK39yj0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OPa8jK39yj0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>Tkay Maidza \u2013 Shook</h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>Nicki Minaj, Lil Kim, Timbaland</p> <p>Tkay Maidza\u2019s 2016 debut album was one of the best Australian releases of the decade, the perfect calling card for this insanely gifted artist. This slickly produced set was followed by an eight-song EP that upped the hip-hop quotient, and a handful of singles that pushed her further in this direction. Shook is another belting hip-hop track and another assured victory: a minimal beat indebted to Timbaland\u2019s barely-there productions of the turn of the century, with Maidza delivering bars and bars of dexterous, effortless rap. It\u2019s her first single since signing to legendary UK label 4AD, home to Grimes, Pixies and Purity Ring, and acts as an apt introduction to her pure hip-hop skills, if not her excellent singing voice and ear for a hook. The bonkers outro is an incredible left-turn, reminiscent of Kanye West\u2019s bolted-on song endings, and a nice harbinger of further experiments in sound.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Check out her 2019 singles: Awake and I DC IF U BE DED</p> <h2>Sweet Whirl \u2013 Closing Time</h2> <p><strong>For fans of:</strong> Carole King, Holly Throsby, Sean Lennon</p> <p>Upon hearing Melbourne songwriter Sweet Whirl aka Esther Edquist\u2019s exquisite debut album, it becomes obvious why her first few recordings came as lo-fi cassettes. This is deeply personal music, perfect when housed in such an intimate artefact as a tape \u2013 designed to be carried in pockets, studied in solitude, worn out through repeated listens, warped by the weather. \u201cI\u2019ve drank too much from the lives of others / Their sorrows have grown stale / Cluttering the table,\u201d she sings of taking on third party pains. It\u2019s a sentiment not often shared in song. Edquis attempts to emotionally distance herself from the song\u2019s subject, despite the very intimacy of the song itself. A stark, plodding keyboard provides the only musical accompaniment \u2013 a ghost chanting softly as Edquist gently explains why she is leaving.</p> <p><strong>For More: </strong>How Much Works is out now.</p> <h2>Ice Cream Hands \u2013 No Weapon but Love</h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>Crowded House, Teenage Fanclub, Paul Kelly</p> <p>For power pop fans across the world, Ice Cream Hands were a criminally underrated band, deserving of the type of transatlantic success their luckier peers found in inner-Melbourne pubs during the 90s. Thirteen years since what was touted as a comeback record, 2007\u2019s The Good China, Ice Cream Hands return with this sparkling anthem to love and life. And, thankfully, they don\u2019t try to reinvent the Rickenbacker with this tune, instead offering up the type of timeless pop they have always trafficked in: dreamy harmonies pulled from the Beatles playbook, jangling guitars that summon summers past, and a simple message of love which will never slide out of style. To quote their 1999 high point, this sound is sweeter than the radio.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Ice Cream Hands\u2019 sixth album will be out in late 2020.</p> <h2>Pure Milk \u2013 Pressure</h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>the Lucksmiths, Bright Eyes, Darren Hanlon</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a167910f77288d783e922b4bb4bd5a2b1cb83c90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a167910f77288d783e922b4bb4bd5a2b1cb83c90/0_270_1080_1350/800.jpg\" alt=\"Australian band Pure Milk\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pure Milk: sadness has never sounded this spritely.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s a laconic country twang to this tune that is quite at odds to the restless anxiety of the lyrics. Gold Coast five-piece Pure Milk make music indebted to Dylan\u2019s lighter records, to Silver Jews and the Saddle Creek roster, and like the aforementioned music, this song lives or dies on its lyrics. \u201cNo signs of life / Only remnants of living / How did I end up in this place?\u201d sings Lewis Nitschinsk, and things don\u2019t get any brighter as he reels through a laundry list of woes, from days that linger forever, to the ghost of a past lover that haunts him. Words like \u201crestless\u201d, \u201cbored\u201d, \u201cawkward\u201d and \u201canxiety\u201d punctuate the malaise. At one point he lists attributes as if to convince himself of their worth. Sadness has never sounded this spritely.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Check out their EP Self Improvement and recent single Conversations.</p> <h2>Pearl the Girl \u2013 Long Way Back</h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>M83, the Preatures, the Grates</p> <p>This is music to drive down the coast to, windows down, a hurricane whipping your hair into your eyes as the song\u2019s giddy momentum seemingly propels the car. With a relentless rhythm and joyous guitar lines chiming throughout, Long Way Back finds the Sydney songwriter building upon triple j fave Single Use Plastic with another hook-crammed jam that never takes its foot off the pedal. Pearl expertly uses space during the verses to suck the air out of the arrangement, a plodding bass and the slight grit of her vocals marking time, until a rush of stabbing one-note guitar parts, and chunky open chords push the chorus into the stratosphere. This is an exciting rock song.</p> <p><strong>For more: </strong>Pearl the Girl\u2019s new EP is released 16 June. Until then, check out her debut album Just a Phase.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/25/sydney-opera-houses-livestreamed-concert-series-could-be-a-game-changer-for-local-bands\">Sydney Opera House's livestreamed concert series could be a game-changer for local bands</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Glenn Richards \u2013 Hi Gene!&nbsp;</h2> <p><strong>For fans of: </strong>80s Bowie, Talking Heads, Lou Reed</p> <p>As songwriter and singer of Melbourne\u2019s Augie March, Glenn Richards has put six excellent albums out into the world, including the stately Sunset Studies, currently celebrating its 20th anniversary. He even wrote a bonafide hit with 2006\u2019s crashing waltz One Crowded Hour, voted both APRA Song of the Year and No 1 song in triple j\u2019s Hottest 100, so it\u2019s surprising that until now, Richards hadn\u2019t released a solo single. Hi Gene! certainly makes a statement. Those expecting the haunted timbre of Augie March will instead be greeted by high-pitched voices spelling out the song title as if from an evil edition of Sesame Street. \u201cI like my music clean,\u201d he chants as if hypnotised by the march of modernity that has led us to polishing all the edges of our art. \u201cI like my body smooth / I like my genitals shaved\u201d, he adds one verse later, over a repeating music box melody. This is a darkly comedic treatise about the times; well-drawn and ultimately a little mean. It\u2019s also the first gambit of what will hopefully prove to be an odd, challenging solo career.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>For more:</strong> Glenn Richards will release a solo album this year, and Augie March are in the process of rescheduling their Sunset Studies anniversary tour.</p>",
  "<p>Not a single person has been charged under New South Wales race hate laws since they were introduced two years ago.</p> <p>In mid-2018, the NSW government reformed its vilification laws after a concerted lobbying effort by an alliance of 31 ethnic community groups, who warned the previous laws were allowing threats of racially-motivated violence to go unpunished.</p> <p>The 2018 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/03/nsw-police-arrest-indigenous-teen-family-plan-private-prosecution-if-sydney-officer-not-charged-australia\">reforms introduced a single new indictable offence</a> for public threats or incitements to violence made on the basis of race, religion, sexuality or HIV/Aids status, which carried a potential three-year prison sentence and $11,000 fine.</p> <p>At the time, the NSW attorney general, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/05/tougher-race-hate-laws-nsw-as-government-reverses-position-again\">Mark Speakman, said the laws sent</a> a \u201cvery clear message\u201d that such actions would not be tolerated.</p> <p>\u201cPeople who incite violence are a threat to community safety,\u201d he said. \u201cIf passed, these laws will help protect individuals and groups from being targeted by cowards who seek to cause physical harm to innocent people.\u201d</p> <p>Since then, however, the laws have not been used.</p> <p>Crime data provided to the NSW parliamentary research service shows no one has been charged, let alone convicted, under the new vilification offence in the Crimes Act as of last week.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/01/anti-asian-racism-surges-in-nsw-during-coronavirus-pandemic\">Anti-Asian racism surges in NSW during coronavirus pandemic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government also waited until September, more than a year after the laws were introduced, to give a grant of $200,000 grant to Legal Aid to develop an awareness campaign, which is only now rolling out.</p> <p>The shadow attorney general, Paul Lynch, said the lack of enforcement showed the government was \u201csimply disinterested in combating racism and vilification in this state\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis government had to be dragged kicking and screaming into amending its laws two years ago. They really didn\u2019t want effective anti-discrimination laws,\u201d he told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>\u201cTheir failure to enforce the new laws or make them effective is the reason no one has ever been convicted under them.\u201d</p> <p>Speakman\u2019s office referred questions on enforcement to NSW police. But he said racial vilification was \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cRacial vilification in any form is totally unacceptable in our community,\u201d Speakman said.</p> <p>\u201cLast week, the NSW Government launched the \u2018Stop Public Threats\u2019 campaign to ensure that the community understands their legal rights and to encourage people to report any threats of violence to police. This campaign has been developed in close consultation with community groups, as well as the NSW police.\u201d</p> <p>The courts are able to take into account racial vilification as an aggravating factor when sentencing for violent offences, without a separate charge being laid under the new law. Laying a charge under the new law also requires the approval of the director of public prosecutions.</p> <p>Lynch says the awareness campaign has come too late.</p> <p>The lack of enforcement was a key complaint about the previous racial vilification powers, contained in the state\u2019s Anti-Discrimination Act.</p> <p>Those powers had been in existence since 1989 but not resulted in a successful prosecution. The inadequacy of the law was laid bare in 2015, when the director of public prosecutions was left unable to charge Ismail Al-Wahwah, the leader of the fringe Islamic movement Hizb ut-Tahrir, who called for a \u201cjihad against the Jews\u201d.</p> <p>In a statement, NSW police said it used a \u201cholistic approach\u201d in the reporting and investigation of bias crimes.</p> <p>\u201cRegular training is provided to ensure all officers have a thorough understanding of bias crimes, and each police area command and police district plays an active role in investigating any report of bias-motivated crime,\u201d the statement said.</p> <p>Responsibility for policing such offences falls to two dedicated units within the counter terrorism and special tactics command (CTSC), the engagement and hate crime unit and the fixated persons investigation unit.</p> <p>\u201cFurther, both units are supported by the CTSTC\u2019s intelligence unit, as well as the Real Time Intelligence Centre, which assess information and provide advice or referrals for further investigation,\u201d NSW police said.</p> <p>\u201cTheir work with the community is also supported by GLLOs (LGBTIQ liaison officer), multicultural community liaison officers, Aboriginal community liaison officers and the cultural diversity team.\u201d</p> <p>NSW police are under fire this week for their treatment of an Indigenous teenager who was<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/02/video-shows-nsw-australia-police-officer-slamming-indigenous-boy-face-first-onto-pavement\">&nbsp;slammed face-first on to a pavement</a> while being arrested.</p> <p>The boy\u2019s mother, father and sister said on Wednesday they had felt \u201cangry\u201d, \u201cfrustrated\u201d and \u201cafraid\u201d after watching footage of a constable&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/02/video-shows-nsw-australia-police-officer-slamming-indigenous-boy-face-first-onto-pavement\">tripping the Indigenous teenager while arresting him, slamming the boy face-first on to bricks</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he should be made to feel like he\u2019s in a prison that\u2019s made up of the whole world,\u201d the boy\u2019s mother said.</p> <p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re Aboriginal we see a lot of this all the time.

  "<p>There is no such thing as a total truce in Westminster, and a partial one rarely lasts long. The period when Labour felt obliged by a sense of duty in a national emergency to provide \u201cconstructive\u201d opposition to the government is over. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/03/pmqs-verdict-boris-johnson-attacks-keir-starmer-for-doing-his-job\" title=\"\">parliament</a> on Wednesday, Sir Keir Starmer accused Boris Johnson of failing to get to grips with the situation and the prime minister responded with affected resentment at the lack of \u201ccooperation\u201d from his counterpart across the dispatch box.</p> <p>But it was Mr Johnson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/28/boris-johnson-brushes-off-tory-revolt-over-dominic-cummings\" title=\"\">decision to support Dominic Cummings</a> over alleged lockdown breaches that incinerated any prospect of political consensus on coronavirus policy. By failing to chastise his maverick aide, the Tory leader committed two grave mistakes. First, he effectively diluted the mandatory element of the regulations, creating an unwritten \u201cCummings clause\u201d for anyone minded to interpret the rules leniently for themselves. Second, he politicised the whole lockdown issue by making it clear that science and evidence are subordinate to the whim of a single Downing Street adviser.</p> <p>That has consequences for the implementation of future regulations. Already, a Conservative rebellion is brewing over plans to impose a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/uk-quarantine-plan-what-will-it-mean-for-travellers\" title=\"\">fortnight of quarantine</a> on people arriving in the UK, with fines of up to \u00a31,000 for those who roam without permission. There are doubts about the viability and purpose of the proposal. Sceptics ask why such a system was not in operation months ago, when the threat of people importing the coronavirus was higher. Enforcement will be piecemeal, with only a fraction of those in quarantine receiving follow-up calls to verify obedience. Workers in a number of sectors will be exempt.</p> <p>The stated reason for the quarantine regime now is to avoid a resurgence of the virus, while the stated reason for not enforcing one earlier is that it would not have made a substantial difference to the trajectory of the epidemic. There is a contradiction there. While infection from overseas is a hazard worth managing, not much about the government\u2019s handling of the disease so far gives confidence that clinical rigour is paramount. </p> <p>But the plan scores well in opinion polls, as tends to be the case with anything involving tighter border control. Going with the grain of public opinion is a large part of the policy\u2019s appeal in Downing Street, especially since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/01/public-trust-in-uk-government-over-coronavirus-falls-sharply\" title=\"\">Cummings affair took a toll</a> on Mr Johnson\u2019s personal ratings.</p> <p>As evidence mounts that Britain\u2019s handling of Covid-19 is among the worst in the world, the government goes to ever greater lengths to demonstrate vigour in its response, with the performance of action taking precedence over achievement. A test, track and trace scheme for monitoring infections after lockdown was said by Mr Johnson to be \u201cworld-beating\u201d \u2013 a silly phrase because it is not a competition \u2013 yet many of those tasked with delivering the service warn that it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/coronavirus-test-and-trace-system-creating-false-sense-of-security\" title=\"\">being launched prematurely</a>, and full national cover will not be reached for weeks.</p> <p>Claims to have met targets for the numbers of tests being administered have subsequently proved highly misleading, with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/government-target-of-200000-covid-19-tests-meaningless\" title=\"\">figures inflated</a> by double-counting. The UK Statistics Authority earlier this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/statistics-watchdog-ministers-still-misleading-public-on-coronavirus-tests\" title=\"\">rebuked Matt Hancock</a>, the health secretary, for providing inadequate data on testing, noting that a lack of transparency breeds public mistrust.</p> <p>At the start of the outbreak, Mr Johnson had a large store of public trust at his disposal. There was a sense of collective duty in facing a national threat. That resource has been shamefully squandered and the prime minister\u2019s own lack of competence and focus is the reason. For any policy to be effective, the public needs to have confidence in the motive for its deployment and that it will work. People need to know that measures are implemented properly and for the right reasons. Mr Johnson is failing both tests.</p>",
  "<p>On Saturday night at 9.30pm, artist&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAx3ZpWneik/\">Eric Rieger</a>&nbsp;set out onto the streets of Minneapolis with digital photos of George Floyd, a video projector and a portable power supply.</p> \n<p>He made a different kind of street art than what we\u2019re used to \u2013 rather than painting a mural on a brick wall, he projected Floyd\u2019s image across the city of Minneapolis, the very same city in which the 46-year-old unarmed black man was murdered on 25 May, after a white police officer held his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds.</p> \n<p>Rieger plugged in and projected portraits of Floyd across the city\u2019s Railroad Bridge, the Gold Medal Flour building and the Love Power Church in downtown Minneapolis.

Although the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/ministers-accused-of-not-taking-covid-19-threat-to-bame-britons-seriously\">Department of Health officially denies it</a>, there were reports that the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/889195/disparities_review.pdf\">Public Health England review</a>&nbsp;was delayed because of concerns in Whitehall about the \u201cclose proximity to the current situation in America\u201d.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The government needn\u2019t have worried, because instead of meeting the grief in our communities at so many deaths from Covid-19, its review <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Zubhaque/status/1267884162335363072?s=20\">fails to offer any new insight</a> anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has now emerged that a key section, containing information on the potential role of discrimination, was <a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/story.aspx?storyCode=7027761\">removed before publication</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The government\u2019s response has been to appoint <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/people/kemi-badenoch\">Kemi Badenoch</a>, the minister for equalities, and a black woman, to <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2020-06-02/matt-hancock-leads-government-s-daily-coronavirus-press-conference/\">\u201cget to the bottom\u201d</a> of the problem.&nbsp;What do we know about Badenoch\u2019s approach to racism in Britain?

I listened to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, announce \u2013 as if it was his new discovery \u2013 that \u201cblack lives matter\u201d, and offer someone as seemingly uninterested in anti-racism as Badenoch as a solution.&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"dc37d49d-12ed-458a-b3d9-1fe4238a91f3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c9nEj6lN7s8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Meanwhile, that \u201chorrible stuff that\u2019s happened in America\u201d?&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Our reaction to George Floyd\u2019s death as black British people is our expression of generations of lifelong, profound, unravelling pain.

  "<p>I know this guy who doesn\u2019t want to be a gangster any more. But leaving that world behind is a challenge for him, because if he runs short of money there\u2019s always the temptation to go and make some very quickly. One evening he listed the many ways he could still pop out and easily make four figures worth of cash before midnight.&nbsp;I wondered if he was a bit of a fantasist. I\u2019ve since found out that he definitely isn\u2019t.&nbsp;Either way, those days are gone.&nbsp;Whenever I ask him how he\u2019s doing, he gives me the same answer. \u201cTrying to find a way,\u201d he says, with a shrug.&nbsp;By which he means, trying to find a way of living without breaking the law. I wish him every success.</p> <p>I once met him for a cup of tea after work.&nbsp;I had just been interviewing a woman who was lamenting the lack of funding for youth clubs.&nbsp;I was told what a short-sighted false economy losing youth clubs is; how these community organisations can keep youngsters out of trouble and reduce crime.&nbsp;I saw the logic of this, without really believing it would work quite like that. So, I asked my ex-criminal mate: \u201cYouth clubs wouldn\u2019t solve anything, would they?\u201d \u201cThey would.&nbsp;They definitely would,\u201d he replied. \u201cThey make a big difference; just giving kids something to do.\u201d Coming from him, this was persuasive.</p> <p>It has been reported this week that drug gangs have <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52892917\">recruited more girls to sell their wares</a>, as they attract less attention on the quieter streets of lockdown. I put this to Michelle Mitchell, who helps run a community organisation called Play in Newcastle, which works to give teenagers the opportunity to do just that, play.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe girls have been doing it for quite some time now,\u201d she told me. \u201cThat\u2019s not new to us. Boys and girls have both been busy with it during lockdown.&nbsp;They\u2019ve taken advantage of the exercise allowance, walking dogs.&nbsp;They\u2019ve been getting a lot of exercise,\u201d she adds drily.</p> <p>I came across Michelle in the course of helping set up a commission, with the ex-footballer Brendon Batson and broadcaster Charlie Webster, to look at the value of community groups like hers. Listening to Michelle for 10 minutes is enough to win anyone over.&nbsp;Her strategy is to give the kids things to do and important stuff to talk about.&nbsp;\u201cWe\u2019ve got access to the River Tyne so I\u2019m like: \u2018Get your coats on, we\u2019re going down there.&nbsp;We\u2019re going to climb some trees; we\u2019re going to build a den.

It\u2019s what they want; it\u2019s about listening to them. They\u2019re always hungry so they always get a meal, which they cook.&nbsp;They love cooking, especially the boys, actually. I love to listen to them; it\u2019s how you engage them. They love to be given their own voice and have time to be heard, about sex, drugs, whatever. You learn so much about what goes on.\u201d</p> <p>This is tough love though. \u201cThey sign a contract; a code of conduct.&nbsp;If they\u2019ve been causing antisocial behaviour out on the street the police will inform us, and when they turn up at the youth club I\u2019ll tell them: \u2018You can\u2019t come in tonight because last night you were giving that old lady grief outside the shop.\u2019&nbsp;And that kills them.&nbsp;They beg me, but I say no; that learns them a lesson.\u201d</p> <p>All of which raises an obvious question: if Michelle and her colleagues, and others like them around the country, weren\u2019t there, what would the kids do?</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where they\u2019d be, and what they\u2019d be up to,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the scary thought; the really scary thought.&nbsp;It\u2019s not even nice to think about.\u201d </p> <p>Not that I would dare to quibble with Michelle any more than my ex-gangster, but places like these are critically important. With the few thousand quid a year they scrape together to fund them, they\u2019re working miracles.</p> <p>It has been said that what we all need is someone to love, something to do and something to look forward to. Groups like Michelle\u2019s provide two of those, at least, to those who need it most.</p> <p>\u2022 Adrian Chiles is a Guardian columnist</p>",

  "<p>You can sense the growing disbelief and anger. All his life Boris Johnson has been told that he is the Special One. A person for whom all rules are there to be broken. He is a man who has consistently managed to fail upwards. Sacked from one job for lying or incompetence, he has always effortlessly moved on to a better one. Friends, family and children have only ever been collateral damage in a ruthless pursuit of an entitled ambition.</p> \n<p>Yet now there is no hiding place. Boris has achieved his narcissistic goal of becoming prime minister and from here the only way is down. And it\u2019s a lonely place to be because even he can\u2019t escape the fact that he\u2019s just not cut out for the top job. It\u2019s not just that it\u2019s too much like hard work and he is basically lazy: it\u2019s that he\u2019s not that good at it. Lame gags, bluster and Latin free association just don\u2019t cut it.</p> \n<p>Put simply, Boris isn\u2019t as bright as he has come to believe he is. In fact, he\u2019s quite dim. And nowhere is this more evident than when he\u2019s up against Keir Starmer at prime minister\u2019s questions in front of a near empty chamber. During their first few outings, much was made of how Boris crumbled in the face of the Labour leader\u2019s forensic questioning. But now it\u2019s clear Johnson can\u2019t cope with any kind of questioning at all. Because even when Starmer isn\u2019t at his absolute sharpest, Boris begins to fall apart. It\u2019s as if he knows he\u2019s up against a man of greater intellect and morality and his only defence is to lash out.</p> \n<p>It doesn\u2019t help that Boris has become his own worst enemy. The charmer turned charmless. Mr Happy turned Mr Angry. It also doesn\u2019t help that even when his friends at the Daily Telegraph try to big him up with a story about how he was going to take direct control over the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus, they only succeed in teeing up Starmer with his first free hit. Who had been in charge of the government during the past three months? Apart from Classic Dom of course. Because we could all take that as read.</p> \n<p>Boris immediately became defensive and snappy. He had always been in control. All that was changing was that now he would be in total control. Besides, he stood behind what the government had done so far. There hadn\u2019t been many other countries that had managed to kill so many of its citizens through negligence and indifference, so that was something of which we should all be proud. Besides why was the Labour leader standing up and asking him all these difficult questions when he could easily have been more supportive?</p> \n<p>This left Starmer rather perplexed as he had a copy of a letter he had written to the prime minister a fortnight ago offering to help find a solution on reopening schools to which he had not yet received a reply. \u201cUm \u2026 er,\u201d said the floundering Boris. He had rung him back. Except he hadn\u2019t. He had merely spoken to all the opposition leaders on a joint conference call.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c84ab7e0-10d0-4e59-9883-4ff18ed02de4\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JiWBb-0KC2s?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There was something almost pathetic about Boris pleading for people to trust him at the very moment he was lying. Starmer merely pointed out that trust had to be earned, and returned to the charge sheet. Why had Johnson eased lockdown restrictions when the woman in charge of track and trace on which the new guidance was predicated had said the programme wouldn\u2019t be fully functional till the end of the month? Why had the guidelines been altered when the threat was still stuck at level 4?</p> \n<p>By now it was clear that Starmer had got under Boris\u2019s skin, and Johnson began to visibly fall apart as he tugged at his hair, tried to prevent his chin from wobbling and angrily jabbed his finger. A prime minister unable to differentiate between being picked on and being subjected to the bare minimum of democratic scrutiny. For Boris even the most modest of criticism is interpreted as a personal betrayal. He might not be very good but he was doing his very best and it was about time the Labour leader and the rest of the country expressed their gratitude for that.</p> \n<p>As so often, the leaders\u2019 exchanges ended with Boris doing a U-turn on government policy. If you had to guess from PMQs who was running the country then you\u2019d have to say it was Starmer. Only the previous day, Johnson had insisted on a three-line whip in support of Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s plans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/rees-moggs-plan-to-end-remote-voting-in-parliament-condemned-by-rights-body\">to </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/rees-moggs-plan-to-end-remote-voting-in-parliament-condemned-by-rights-body\">institutionalise discrimination into the workings of the Commons</a>. Now it sounded very much as if he had had a change of mind. Which had meant that much of Tuesday\u2019s proceedings had been as big a waste of time as MPs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/the-tories-turn-parliament-into-the-worlds-worst-theme-park\">queueing up for 90 minutes</a> to deprive absent MPs of a vote.</p> \n<p>Not that queueing was necessarily a bad thing, Boris ad-libbed. The public had queued for Ikea so it was right for MPs to get their knees dirty and queue to vote as well. Even though there was a fully functional alternative up and running already. It\u2019s getting harder and harder to know where satire ends and reality starts. </p> \n<p>Boris breathed a sigh of relief when Starmer\u2019s six questions came to an end, but there was no let up. The SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford twice asked Boris to condemn President Trump\u2019s handling of the riots in the US \u2013 teargassing peaceful protesters to get a photo op in front of a church had been a particular low point \u2013 and twice the prime minister declined. Even Theresa May got in on the act by asking a Brexit question he couldn\u2019t answer. How the Tory benches could do with her at PMQs right now.</p> \n<p>The truth is that Boris is a beaten man even before he stands up to speak at the dispatch box. He knows that. Keir knows that. Worst of all, the country knows that. The shouting is all just empty, white noise. A distraction from his own limitations. And at a time of national crisis you can\u2019t get away with putting that on the side of a bus.</p>",
  "<p>More than 60 victims have been forced to go to court over the past decade to deny that they consented to strangulation, assaults or violence, according to the campaign to end reliance on the \u201crough sex\u201d defence.</p> <p>Figures for the number of such court appearances have been collected by the organisation <a href=\"https://wecantconsenttothis.uk/\">We Can\u2019t Consent to This</a>, which supports amendments to the domestic abuse bill being considered by MPs on Thursday.</p> <p>The lobby group is one of several calling for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/nov/22/concern-over-use-rough-sex-gone-wrong-defence-uk-courts)\">changes to the law to prevent defendants blaming victims </a>\u2013 almost invariably women \u2013 for the violence inflicted on them by alleging they had consented during \u201csex games\u201d.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Boris Johnson repeated his commitment to end the rough sex defence. During prime minister\u2019s questions, he was challenged by the Conservative MP Laura Farris who asked: \u201cWhen men who kill their partners in appalling acts of sexual violence establish in court that \u2018she asked for it\u2019 and avoid a murder conviction, does [he] agree that the time is now to end the rough sex defence?\u201d</p> <p>Responding, Johnson, whose fiancee, Carrie Symonds, was a victim of predatory sex attacker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/john-worboys\">John Worboys</a>, said: \u201cShe raises an incredibly important point and we do \u2013 we are committed to ensuring that the law is made clear on this point and that defence is inexcusable.\u201d</p> <p>Rebecca Hitchen, campaigns manager at the End Violence Against Women Coalition, welcomed the prime minister\u2019s statement: \u201cIt is past time for the government to get rid of the ability of men who murder women to claim in court as a defence that it was consensual and part of rough sex.\u201d</p> <p>Campaigners argue that the defence should not have been open to any defendant since 1993 when a test case, R v Brown, in the House of Lords resulted in the conviction of a group of men for assault and wounding even though their sadomasochistic victims willingly participated in the violence.</p> <p>But We Can\u2019t Consent to This has assembled evidence of 67 cases in the past 10 years in which it said victims were nonetheless required to come to court to deny that they had consented to physical attacks. Going back as far as 1997, it said, it had discovered a total of 115 such cases.</p> <p>The cases involved women whose attackers claimed they consented to acts including \u201cwaterboarding, wounding, electrocution, strangulation and asphyxiation, slapping, beating, punching and kicking, and, in one case, a shotgun fired intimately at a woman,\u201d the campaign group said. \u201cIn every one of these cases, the victim insisted that she did not consent to the violence.\u201d</p> <p>The organisation believes that, going back to the 1970s, as many as 60 women in the UK have been killed in violence, which it was claimed they had consented to.</p> <p>Among those who died in similar circumstances recently was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/22/grace-millane-murder-trial-guilty-new-zealand-man-british-backpacker\">the British backpacker Grace Millane</a> who was murdered in Auckland, New Zealand.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a tenfold increase in rough sex claims between 1996 and 2016 in the UK and, in every case that we have found, the defendant has been male, many with a substantial domestic abuse history or other convictions for serious violence against women, like rape, kidnap or homicide,\u201d the campaign group said.</p> <p>\u201cWe have long said that the existing law is not working. Our evidence shows that although case law in England and Wales is said to prohibit \u2018consent\u2019 claims in defence to violence, it is routinely disregarded in the criminal justice system, and these claims work, resulting in a lighter sentence, a lesser charge, or no prosecution at all \u2013 and the woman\u2019s sexual history used to prove she asked for it, even where she says she didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>The organisation has also accused the Crown Prosecution Service of failing to pursue charges in a recent case in which a woman who reported a violent assault to police has, reportedly, been told in a CPS letter that the prosecution would not be pursued because \u201cthe courts have shown an interest in changing the law so that the suspect could say that you consented to these assaults. This would be difficult to disprove\u201d.</p> <p>A CPS spokesperson said: \u201cTackling violence against women and girls has long been a CPS priority, and one we remain strongly committed to.</p> <p>\u201cClaims that a victim has \u2018consented\u2019 to an assault do not stop us from prosecuting. We work closely with the police to build and strengthen cases, and if our legal test is met, we will always prosecute, no matter how challenging the case.\u201d</p>",

his personal reckoning over the concept of white privilege. \u201cI know a lot of white people bristle when they hear the word \u2018privilege\u2019, as in white privilege, because there are millions of white people who didn\u2019t grow up with money or a good education or a solid family background, or maybe even a family at all,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when they hear the word privilege, they go, \u2018what privilege?\u2019\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Kimmel admitted that like many white people, he felt defensive when he first heard the term: \u201cI rejected it, because I didn\u2019t understand what white privilege meant,\u201d thinking it meant people with a \u201csilver spoon\u201d like Trump, and not his upbringing.</p> <p>But \u201cpeople who are white, we don\u2019t have to deal with negative assumptions being made about us based on the color of our skin \u2026 whereas black people experience that every day,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine how frustrating it must be to have to prove yourself to be something other than what people assume you probably are every day, sometimes multiple times every day.</p> <p>\u201cAnd now imagine what it must be like to be brutalized and killed and scared that those things might happen. What happened to George Floyd was on video \u2013 how often does this happen without a camera recording the whole thing?</p> <p>\u201cSo if you\u2019re wondering why people are angry and why they can\u2019t just march nicely in the street holding up the signs in a single-file line, maybe that\u2019s why,\u201d he concluded, adding: \u201cWhite privilege doesn\u2019t mean your life hasn\u2019t been hard, it just means the color of your skin isn\u2019t one of the things that makes it harder.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>My husband, David Smallbone, who has died aged 73 of pneumonia and Parkinson\u2019s disease, started his career as a geography teacher and went on to become one of the leading scholars on entrepreneurship in the UK, with a specialism in transition economies, particularly eastern Europe and China.</p> <p>He founded the Centre for Enterprise and Economic Development at Middlesex University in 1993, helping to establish small business research as a distinct area of academic study. He was president of the European Council for Small Business and Entrepreneurship from 2005 to 2007, and worked with academics, practitioners and policymakers all over the world.</p> <p>From 2004 he was associate director of the Small Business Research Centre at Kingston University, Surrey.

He built up a network of research partnerships with colleagues across the region, in Belarus, Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, supporting the transition to an enterprise economy following years of centralised control.</p> <p>On one occasion in 1998, getting ready for a trip to Minsk, he put a package of several thousand US dollars in his suitcase. Was he really a drug dealer? No \u2013 with the scarcity of salaries and lack of trust in the banking system his colleagues wanted their research funding in cash. His travels sometimes took him to the edge of danger. He was held at gunpoint in Lagos and in 2011 was on one of the last flights out of Cairo as the Arab Spring protests escalated.</p> <p>David was born in Basingstoke, Hampshire, the oldest of five children of Mary (nee Ferguson), a hairdresser, and Peter, a production engineer, who designed and built the family home. After attending Queen Mary\u2019s grammar school in the town, and an economics degree at Portsmouth Polytechnic (now the University of Portsmouth), he taught geography at the Nobel school in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, from 1968 to 1974.</p> <p>He then became a lecturer at Middlesex Polytechnic (later Middlesex University), where he was made professor of small and medium enterprises in 1997. He wrote three books, co-edited several more and published some 200 articles and chapters, on topics including enterprise in rural areas, ethnic minority businesses, social inclusion and women\u2019s entrepreneurship.</p> <p>In recent years he brushed off the burden of Parkinson\u2019s disease and continued to travel (with wheelchair and a carer) across Europe, the former Soviet Union, India, China, New Zealand and South America.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/china-accuses-uk-of-gross-interference-over-hong-kong-citizenship-offer\">Boris Johnson\u2019s promise</a> to give millions of Hong Kong citizens a path to UK citizenship is a remarkable offer from a government that has spent four years wrestling with Brexit so as to end the free movement of people from Europe. </p> <p>For one door to be slammed shut only for another to be opened so wide is striking, especially since the policy\u2019s popularity among the Conservative membership or pro-Brexit voters has yet to be tested. Recent polling by the Cabinet Office unearthed widespread ignorance about China.</p> <p>The argument in government circles is that Brexit was never about halting migration, but about sovereignty and the right for the UK to control its own migration policy, including by selecting those with the skills most needed in the UK.</p> <p>It can be argued that the quartet at the top of the Tories are the archetypal beneficiaries of migration. The family of the home secretary, Priti Patel, fled Uganda. The father of the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, came to the UK from Czechoslovakia aged six in 1938, following the Munich agreement, which gave parts of Czechoslovakia to Nazi Germany. The grandparents of the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, arrived in the 60s from east Africa. Even the prime minister, Boris Johnson, a product of Eton and Oxford, has both Turkish and American ancestors. They are not quite citizens of nowhere, the phrase used insultingly by Theresa May, the former prime minister, but all four have backgrounds that make them alive to the benefits of political asylum.</p> <p>There is also a streak of guilt that runs through the Conservative party about its treatment of Hong Kong citizens, and an admission that, under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher, the great cold warrior, it placed the people of Hong Kong into the hands of the Chinese Communist party in 1994.</p> <p>After the handover, Hong Kong citizens ended up with a jerry-built halfway house. They could hold a British national overseas passport, providing them consular assistance and protection through UK diplomatic posts, but they would not have the automatic right to live or work in the UK. Those born after 1997 would have no rights.</p> <p>In his memoirs, the last governor of Hong Kong, Lord Patten, wrote: \u201cEven in the 1990s many Conservatives and much of the British media resisted any idea we should be moderately generous in the award of citizenship to some of those who lived in Hong Kong (often serving directly the colonial power) and deserved a guarantee if necessary they could look to Britain for a home after 1997. <em>Civis Romanus </em><em>sum</em> was not to be translated into a modern British obligation. Australia, Canada, both of course Commonwealth countries, were much more generous over the granting of citizenship to Hong Kong residents. They were a lot more maternal than the so-called \u2018mother country\u2019.</p> <p>Thatcher took some political flak at the time. In 1989, Paddy Ashdown, the Mandarin-speaking leader of the newly merged Social and Liberal Democrats, defined his new party in the wake of Tiananmen Square by campaigning for Hong Kong citizens to be given the right of abode. </p> <p>So how has Ashdown\u2019s liberal view become the political consensus? There were, after all, influential migrants at the top of the May and David Cameron governments. Cameron, a Sinophile, confined himself to urging China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, on a state visit to the UK in 2015 to allowing Hongkongers to choose their own leader without Beijing\u2019s prior vetting.</p> <p>Cameron had seen what had happened to Angela Merkel when she opened the door to Syrian refugees in 2015, and was not going there with Hong Kong.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42908e3bd72685f128da63269d1d0b1fbeb3d5c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42908e3bd72685f128da63269d1d0b1fbeb3d5c8/0_91_2984_1790/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cameron and Xi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron drinking with Xi Jinping at a pub near Chequers during the 2015 state visit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yes, individual cabinet members have played their part in the change of mind, but bigger trends forced Johnson into a choice. With protests growing ever more violent in Hong Kong and elections producing pro-democracy legislatures, the possibility that China would wreak revenge and end the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement had to be countenanced. A cross-government contingency planning group was set up in September.</p> <p>The contingency group was formed amid a broader rethink in the Conservative party about China. By last summer an influential group of Tory MPs, including Iain Duncan Smith, Damian Green and Tom Tugendhat, came to the conclusion that the rise of China under Xi was a threat to the west and needed to be resisted. Global Britain, a foggy concept for many years, came to be defined as a commitment to openness, democracy and a rules-based order. Hong Kong serendipitously became the rallying point for this foreign policy. China\u2019s handling of coronavirus, and the controversy over Huawei, has further embedded this process.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/it-is-much-worse-veterans-of-hong-kongs-2003-protests-fear-new-china-law\">'It is much worse': veterans of Hong Kong's 2003 protests fear new law</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The UK has few levers apart from moral persuasion with which to deter Beijing from pressing ahead with the security laws.

Its enormous concrete dome rises in sharply serrated steps, perforated with screens of chevron tiles, above four long streamlined arms that stretch out like the wings of a benevolent mothership, sheltering the chaotic labyrinth of market stalls below. Built in the 1930s, as a futuristic fusion of French art deco and Khmer temple motifs, it featured the second largest concrete dome in the world at the time (trumped only by the Pantheon in Rome), a fitting symbol of the Cambodian capital\u2019s status as the \u201cPearl of Asia\u201d.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t have high hopes for Phnom Penh when I arrived there on a backpacking trip in 2003, after a few days exploring the jungle temple complex of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/16/lost-cities-6-angkor-wat-nasa-technology-khmer-megacity\">Angkor Wat</a> and the floating villages of <a href=\"https://www.outsidenomad.com/tonle-sap-lake/\">Tonl\u00e9 Sap</a>. I had been warned to get out of the Cambodian capital as quickly as possible and head for the coast. Almost entirely emptied of its population by the genocidal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/khmer-rouge\">Khmer Rouge</a> regime in the 1970s, the city was now bouncing back as an unplanned jumble, with French colonial buildings left to rot as new development expanded outwards in an unbridled sprawl.</p> <p>Yet Phnom Penh had a magnetic charm in its frenzied muddle, with dense streets of Chinese shophouses jostling for position with crumbling French mansions and heroic 1960s experiments in the <a href=\"https://assemblepapers.com.au/2020/04/23/forgotten-lessons-vann-molyvann-and-the-new-khmer-architecture-school/\">New Khmer </a><a href=\"https://assemblepapers.com.au/2020/04/23/forgotten-lessons-vann-molyvann-and-the-new-khmer-architecture-school/\">architecture</a> of post-independence Cambodia.

Wat Phnom still stands there, progressively enlarged and gilded over the centuries by generations of kings, its hill raised by tonnes of soil excavated from where the central market now stands.</p> <p>The temple\u2019s white conical stupa rises above a cityscape that is mostly the result of French beaux-arts planning, its network of broad boulevards and public parks laid out from the 1870s onwards when Cambodia became a French protectorate. Under Parisian control until 1953, the city developed into a supremely elegant place, its tree-lined streets flanked by creamy stucco piles and ornate neo-Khmer fantasies such as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Palace_of_Cambodia\">Royal Palace</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Cambodia\">National Museum</a>, along with art deco wonders including the central market.</p> <p>But the period that is enjoying renewed interest, overlooked until recently and still under threat, is the daring post-independence work of the 60s.

His first building was the expressive <a href=\"http://www.conferencehall.co/en/chaktomuk-conference-hall/\">Chaktomuk conference hall</a>, which still stands on the banks of the river like the leaf of a gigantic fan palm. Its zig-zag roof expands outwards in a broad arc, enclosing the fan-shaped hall and presenting the street with a curved frontage like an ornamental tiara. Next came the <a href=\"http://www.uncubemagazine.com/blog/15359429\">National Sports Complex</a> (proudly known as the Olympic Stadium, despite Cambodia having never hosted the Olympic Games), a sublime essay in concrete construction, with four cantilevered waffle-slab roofs each supported by a single column \u2013 a feat managed with the help of Le Corbusier\u2019s engineer, Vladimir Bodiansky. A structure as archaic as it is monumental, it has allusions to the temples of Angkor with its axial layout and quadripartite divisions, as well as clever passive environmental techniques, using moats to encourage ventilation and cooling, way ahead of its time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6d4f9e14610286689cccb7bb0d81509dbd61e17f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d4f9e14610286689cccb7bb0d81509dbd61e17f/0_600_4724_2375/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chaktomuk conference hall, 1961, by Vann Molyvann\" width=\"1000\" height=\"503\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Like an ornamental tiara ...

A roof of honeycomb tubes hangs above an open loggia where windows are set back behind deep concrete shading fins; brick panels appear to float above a bridge flanked by naga (the divine half-serpent creatures of Hindu mythology), leading to elevated causeways that snake their way around the lush green campus above a series of cooling ponds.</p> <p>Tapering concrete columns ring a circular library, modelled on a typical Cambodian farmer\u2019s straw hat, while a series of lecture halls are lined up along the side of a bridge pathway like chubby animals at a drinking trough. While the city\u2019s new shopping malls are often chilled to arctic temperatures by energy-guzzling air conditioning, the rooms of the college are pleasantly cool without any mechanical systems, thanks to Vann\u2019s climate-sensitive designs. \u201cCambodia is a society of half-earth, half-water,\u201d the architect said. \u201cCities should not be built by landfill but by incorporating water into their design.\u201d</p> <p>Sadly these are principles that seem to have been all but abandoned. In 2000, a Taiwanese investment company signed a contract to renovate the stadium in exchange for building on the land around it; the company proceeded to fill up the moats with offices and shops, destroying the hydraulic cooling system in the process. The surrounding land has since been sold for development, leading to a rash of high-rise blocks that now fringe the grounds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5465fa925539df4bfcc9560aa4669c7543c3e61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5465fa925539df4bfcc9560aa4669c7543c3e61/0_1059_5574_3342/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Royal University Campus, 1972, by Vann Molyvann\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Masterpiece of the New Khmer spirit ...

  "<p>News that Boris Johnson is to take \u201cdirect control\u201d of the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/06/02/exclusive-boris-johnson-takes-back-control-coronavirus-crisis/\">raises more questions than it answers</a>. What exactly has the prime minister been doing until now? Were we not also told, when he returned to work in April after his brush with death in St Thomas\u2019 hospital, that he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/01/boris-johnson-is-back-but-has-he-changed-coronavirus\">resuming control</a> then as well? Taking back control seems to be rather harder than it sounds. Maybe he should have grasped that a bit sooner.&nbsp;</p> <p>Trying to get a grip goes with the job. Prime ministers dream of being able to make an announcement, issue an order and then pull a lever or press a button so that things will happen. It almost never works, which is why prime ministers react by doing what Johnson has just done. They shake up Downing Street. They bring in new people. They form new committees. Then they try again. Sometimes the problem is the prime minister. More often the problem is the state machine. In Johnson\u2019s case it is both, which is a bad combination.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s need to reassert his government\u2019s purpose is urgent. He mishandled the pandemic. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/31/further-questions-for-dominic-cummings-and-boris-johnson\">Dominic Cummings made things worse</a>. The public mood is one of uncertainty. The lockdown has been eased, mainly in England, but the pandemic remains the greater reality. For all the bluster, Johnson seems to understand that Covid-19 is not, after all, his finest hour. His current message, insofar as one can be discerned, is not that he is in charge but almost the very opposite: that we should sort this out for ourselves.</p> <p>Johnson knows he is on the back foot. He has lost a lot of popularity and authority. He is clearly rattled. His ratings have taken a <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/boris-johnsons-poll-lead-takes-fresh-tumble-in-wake-of-dominic-cummings-row\">very bad hit</a>, though that may have eased a little and the change must not be overstated. The Conservative party remains ahead of Labour \u2013 hardly surprising so early in a parliament and in the midst of a crisis. But the gap has narrowed and Keir Starmer is now polling better than Johnson. The Labour leader looks and talks like a prime minister. The man in No 10 struggles to do the same. Personally and politically, Johnson has had a bad pandemic. This is not what he thought being prime minister would be like. He wants to get back to being the leader of Brexit Britain.</p> <p>Faced with this problem, Johnson\u2019s instincts are telling. In essence, they are to declare the pandemic over, to move back to Brexit, and to centralise. Johnson has not quite had the bottle to declare \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/01/george-bush-mission-accomplished-at-ten\">Mission Accomplished</a>\u201d yet, as George W Bush did over Iraq even while the bombs were still exploding in Baghdad. But, in his own way, that is what he is up to. Covid-19 has not provided him with the Churchillian moment that he imagined. It has proved too big for him. Now he simply wants the country, and British politics, to be rid of it. As a result, the lockdown is being eased while infections and deaths are still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-nears-50000-latest-official-figures-show\">more numerous here than elsewhere</a>, and before a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/coronavirus-test-and-trace-system-creating-false-sense-of-security\">comprehensive testing system</a>, the umbilical precondition for easing lockdown, is properly in place.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s big gamble is that the public is as bored with the pandemic as he is. It is a safe bet that this will have been tested to the nth degree in the government\u2019s focus groups. But it doesn\u2019t square with what people tell the opinion polls, which is that the lockdown is being lifted too fast. Perhaps Johnson calculates that a government promising better times will always score over one that says stay home. Perhaps he reckons Labour can be pigeonholed as nanny-state worryguts and killjoys. Perhaps it is simply that he is a rule-breaker who thinks regulations are for little people. His anger and aggression against Starmer at question time this week were real enough to suggest he knows it\u2019s all still on a knife edge.</p> <p>The attempt to fire up the hedonism agenda \u2013 turbocharged by the press front pages this week \u2013 is a tremendous risk, politically and medically. There are lots of people out there who are longing for summer holidays, busting to get into the pub for a pint and gagging to watch a football match. But most people tell the pollsters that they prefer to play it safe. They have accepted that they won\u2019t be flying off anywhere soon. They will move on only when they trust the facts, and Johnson is palpably neither a facts man nor especially trustworthy. It could all still go horribly wrong.</p> <p>As he tries to move Covid-19 into the past, Johnson is marginalising parliament and the media. These are places where Labour can appear to be on an equal footing with the Tories. For that reason, they are now going to be relegated. Government briefings will be scaled back. Ministerial appearances on the BBC will become rarer again. And parliament will become a despised afterthought. The ludicrous scenes of MPs queueing up to vote embody Johnson\u2019s \u2013 and Cummings\u2019 \u2013 contempt for every aspect of parliamentary accountability. Never has it been more obvious that a government regards MPs as nothing more than lobby fodder. The new Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, is being shown who is boss in no uncertain terms.&nbsp;</p> <p>The phrase \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jul/11/guardianobituaries.obituaries\">We are the masters now</a>\u201d was originally associated with Labour hubris after the landslide victory in 1945. Today, the same words are the key to understanding Johnson\u2019s Conservative government strategy. His failures over coronavirus may be irritating. Cummings\u2019 conduct may be embarrassing. But while his effective majority of 87 holds, Johnson can afford to treat everything except Brexit with contempt. He may well get away with it, even to the extent of making a trade deal with the one-man axis of evil in the White House.</p> <p>\u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>Here\u2019s a film that has been dug out from near the back of the freezer cabinet \u2013&nbsp;something from 2018. It\u2019s a teen female-friendship, coming-of-ager from 27-year-old actor and co-screenwriter Hannah Marks who stars here, channelling a young Sandra Bullock.</p> <p>She plays Californian high-school student April, dating the egregiously hot Nick (Dylan Sprouse) who breaks up with her at the end of the senior year. So begins April\u2019s summer of misery, which seems complete when she learns, from Insta-stalking Nick, that he is now dating gorgeous Clara (Liana Liberato).

  "<h2>TO PORTUGAL!</h2> \n<p>Like an exasperated reader, a terrible thought struck The Fiver today. Big Website and lots of Sworn-at Enemies have been using the recent suspension of football to go all retro, serving up deep-frozen takes on fascinating events from the past: and we have been missing that trick all along! So let\u2019s right that wrong right now. All aboard for a trip down memory lane as we recall Great Fivers of Yesteryear! Woo-hoo!</p> \n<p>Erm \u2026</p> \n<p>Yes.</p> \n<p>Well.</p> \n<p>The thing is \u2026</p> \n<p>Oh, look! Gil Vicente [subs note: check spelling] are playing at Portimonense [check existence of] today! Woo-hoo! The Portuguese league is back, baby!</p> \n<p>Boy, it sure feels like forever since The Fiver last watched a match from the \u2026 [tap, tap, tap] \u2026 Primeira Liga. In fact, Portugal\u2019s top flight has been on pause since 12 March and its resumption will take place amid safety controls said to be stringent. Matches will, of course, take place behind closed doors. \u201cWithout fans there will be a lack of condiments,\u201d belched Porto manager S\u00e9rgio Concei\u00e7\u00e3o as he cooked up the sort of convoluted metaphor that could be read as a come-and-get-me plea to The Fiver. \u201cEating a salad without oil or vinegar is not the same,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut if we are hungry, we have to eat anyway.\u201d</p> \n<p>Porto, league leaders by one point, are also in action, away to Famalic\u00e3o [also check existence of]. Despite fears of supporters congregating around stadiums, several clubs have objected to the league\u2019s proposal to allow matches to be screened for free on TV \u2013 Benfica president Lu\u00eds Filipe Vieira declared himself \u201coutraged\u201d at the attempt to get politicians\u2019 backing for that wheeze.

  "<p>\u2018We leapt at the chance of visiting Venice. The idea of seeing it with hardly any people was too good an opportunity to miss.\u201d Marco Schmandt and Nina Goretzko are standing outside Venice\u2019s railway station, checking Google Maps for directions to their B&amp;B.</p> <p>The pair are German students who arrived in February from Berlin to study at Florence University, where they have been in lockdown since March. \u201cI have been several times to Venice but this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The train was no problem \u2013 we just had to wear masks \u2013 and now here we are. What is more we found a friendly family-owned B&amp;B, just off Piazza San Marco, who offered us 50% discount, so we are able to take it for four days,\u201d says Marco</p> <p>For the past two weeks, only those from the surrounding Veneto region have been able to go to Venice, but from today people from all over the country are free to travel again, and the country\u2019s international borders are open, with no quarantine restrictions. Venice\u2019s Marco Polo airport is functioning, with Air France-KLM flights to Paris and Amsterdam, as well as onward international connections. More airlines are looking at recommencing flights from July, though foreign tourists are unlikely to arrive until the opening of Schengen frontiers is confirmed, which could be as early as 15 June.</p> <p>Marianna Serandrei is the fourth generation running <a href=\"https://www.hotelsaturnia.it/\">Hotel Saturnia &amp; International</a>, in a 15th-century palazzo five minutes\u2019 walk from Saint Mark\u2019s. \u201cWe reopened on 30 May and immediately had guests from Vicenza, Padua and Treviso. Today is the big day though \u2013 the&nbsp;opening&nbsp;of the border \u2013 and we have 10 arrivals. This may not sound much but it is an exciting beginning, even if we have 87 rooms. We are expecting guests from China and Eastern Europe who booked a few weeks ago, though we will not know where they have flown&nbsp;from until they check in. With flights arriving today from Amsterdam and Rome, it is likely they will have had international connections. And next week we are delighted that&nbsp;a couple of Americans have made a new booking but, again, we will only&nbsp;find out where exactly they\u2019ve come from when they arrive \u2026 as we hope they will.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54722f712108bc52eb29e50b724b022a6c0277c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54722f712108bc52eb29e50b724b022a6c0277c3/0_102_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A waiter serves two tourists at the outdoor tables of the \u2018Caffe Quadri\u2019 on St Mark\u2019s square.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A waiter serves two tourists at the outdoor tables of the Caffe Quadri on St Mark\u2019s square.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrea Merola/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As of 1 June,&nbsp;Venetians are no longer required to wear masks outside, which makes walking around feel more normal, though it pays to have one in your pocket as they are mandatory in shops or on a vaporetto. People are supposed to stay one metre apart, and as throughout the lockdown, there will be a visible police presence ready to hand out fines, especially when late-night drinking at gets out of hand at hotspots such as Fondamenta dei Ormesini, Campo Santa Margherita and Campo Bella Vienna by the Rialto.</p> <p>Venice started gradually reopening early, from 14 May, and residents already see the greatest difference at weekends. Walking around Venice on weekdays is like stepping back in time, with most streets and squares deserted, vaporetti empty apart from rush hour, and the Rialto market, which stayed open throughout, no longer packed with slow-moving tour groups. The still waters of canals are disturbed only by slender wooden boats, rowed by locals standing up in classic gondolier style, rather than the <em>moto ondoso</em> waves made by speeding water taxis. How long it will stay like this is the big question, and no one can agree on the answer.&nbsp;</p> <p>My local spit-and-sawdust osteria, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Osteria-ai-40-Ladroni/180811838629011\">Ai Quaranta Ladroni</a>, has hung a \u20ac10 menu sign in English. \u201cIt\u2019s a welcome back, just in case some foreign tourists were stranded here and want to eat in a restaurant again,\u201d says owner Maurizio Scarpa. \u201cI have been paying the salary for our six staff for the whole of lockdown \u2013 they are Bangladeshi like most of the bar and restaurant workers in Venice \u2013 and now I need tourists to come back. The rest of the year will be a big test, especially with no cruise ships. It is fashionable to want to ban cruise ships but the reality is they bring tourists who spend money, who allow my osteria to flourish and employ people. [In normal times] at the weekend, 90% of our clientele are tourists.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e588f4607a9ef6867ef83dc220b3f00939a78ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e588f4607a9ef6867ef83dc220b3f00939a78ac/0_269_5295_3178/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gondoliers wearing protective face masks wait for tourists.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gondoliers wearing protective face masks wait for tourists.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrea Pattaro/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Everywhere I walk, bars and osterie are busy, with staff in masks and gloves, and customers using smartphones to scan barcodes on menus. While the flagship <a href=\"https://www.labiennale.org/en/architecture/2021\">Architecture Biennale</a> has been postponed till 2021, the Venice Film Festival is going ahead from 2-12 September, and the weekend of 18 July will see the traditional Festa della Redentore firework display. From 15 June, cinemas and theatres reopen, and the Fenice opera house is planning a spectacular musical installation, whose details are still secret. And the long sandy beaches of the Lido are already open, with spaced sun loungers awaiting a summer invasion. The many campsites along this Adriaticcoast are already gearing up for a short but hectic summer season.</p> <p>Hotels and B&amp;Bs have been closed for three months, endangering vast numbers of jobs. Claudio Scarpa, director of the Venice hoteliers\u2019 association, says: \u201cFor the first three months we are projecting 15% occupancy, as no one yet knows how frequently international flights will return to Venice. However from September until the end of the year we are more optimistic, forecasting 35%. We will introduce a compulsory, <em>accoglienza sicura </em>sticker, so tourists can feel sure that their hotel has met sanitisation and health regulations.\u201d</p> <p>Two-star Hotel Guerrini near the railway stationis expecting its first guests on 11 June. \u201cWe already have two reservations for that day, so we will be open, as we have been for over 80 years,\u201d says owner Adriano Mazzo. \u201cEverything will be slow at first, to be sure, but we have had several inquiries from foreign travellers about availability and reservations in November and December.\u201d</p> <p>Luxury hotels are not all rushing to reopen, but Giampaolo Ottazzi, director of the iconic Cipriani, tells me: \u201cWe will be greeting guests again from 19 June and I hope that flights arriving again at Italian airports will permit the return of our international clientele alongside Italian guests. In terms of reservation enquiries, the US market is especially interested from August onwards, whereas UK travellers are waiting to learn how and when they will be able to come here again.\u201d</p> <p>He says the Cipriani is already getting enquires from countries such as Germany, Switzerland, Austria and France as well as places in the Middle East. \u201cI believe there really is a strong desire to travel again, especially with family\u201d<br></p> <p>Not everyone here is welcoming back tourists with open arms. Environmental scientist Jane da Mosto is co-founder and director of the NGO <a href=\"https://weareherevenice.org/\">We Are Here Venice</a>, and is also active in the <a href=\"http://www.nograndinavi.it/\">movement against cruise ships</a>. She says: \u201cWe have a genuine opportunity today to change the future of Venice, and when the free movement of people is restored, we have to stop having such a tourism-dominated economy. There is a lot of idealist talk going around, but government is not putting forward any serious, coherent policies or proposals at this unique moment. We can seize the chance to reinvent Venice and capitalise on the human potential of the residents of what is still a living city. To \u2018save Venice\u2019 you have to save the residents first, give them affordable places to live and alternative work opportunities.\u201d</p> <p>Her views are echoed by Cesare Benelli of fine-dining restaurant <a href=\"https://ristorantealcovo.com/\">Al Covo</a> . \u201cThis is the moment we must grab to definitively change Venice, limit the number of visitors and stop the daily mass invasion of people who contribute nothing and disrespect our special city,\u201d he says. \u201cYes, this may mean restaurants serving preheated pastas and microwaved pizzas have to close, along with gift shops peddling poor-quality carnival masks, plastic gondolas and fake Murano glass. Well so be it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb8bd64706a26cbecb0d77e9d56d6814e8dcc76e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb8bd64706a26cbecb0d77e9d56d6814e8dcc76e/0_241_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cruise ship seen from one of the canals leading into the Venice Lagoon in June, 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A cruise ship seen from one of the canals leading into the Venice Lagoon in June, 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Miguel Medina/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>Even people whose livelihood depends on tourism have words of warning. Tour guide Mariangela Du Chaliot, a born and bred Venetian, says: \u201cI have no work, just 100% cancellations. Guides here live by international tourism: no flights and no cruise ships simply means no work. It will take up to two years to return to \u2018normality\u2019, though I hope that this will be a turning point, that the new normality won\u2019t mean streets so packed I can hardly even run my tours. Somehow we need to transform mass tourism pouring in for a day trip to Venice Disneyland into longer-stay quality travel to a unique destination.\u201d</p> <p>As I walk through quiet backstreets towards Saint Mark\u2019s Square, gondolier Mauro Tochi is patiently waiting for customers. \u201cWe were asked to come back on duty from 1 June, ready to welcome visitors again,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I don\u2019t expect any work for the first few weeks, till flights really start working again in July. If there is one place in the world people will want to come back to when they can travel again I honestly believe it will be Venice. Nothing compares to our city. But I hope also that this new generation of tourists that come here will respect the city more. Who knows, maybe they will start listening to what I tell them of the history of the Serenissima as we glide down the canals, rather than snapping selfies and talking on their phones.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>More people have now died in care homes in Scotland than in hospitals, according to the latest figures from the National Records of Scotland (NRS), which also show that overall deaths have fallen for the fifth week running.</p> <p>The latest data on weekly deaths occurring in various settings shows that 1,818 deaths linked to the virus have occurred in care homes since the outbreak began, compared with 1,815 deaths recorded in hospitals.</p> <p>Week-on-week figures for Scottish facilities show that the number of care home deaths has been higher than that in hospitals&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/29/scottish-care-homes-defend-coronavirus-response-deaths-rise\">for six weeks now</a>, but this is the first time that the cumulative number of deaths has been higher in care homes than in hospitals.</p> <p>The figures come as the Scottish government faces continued scrutiny over care home deaths, including the discharge of untested patients to care settings at the beginning of the outbreak, which the Scottish Conservative leader, Jackson&nbsp;Carlaw, has described as a \u201cnational&nbsp;scandal\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/28/why-did-so-many-people-die-of-covid-19-in-the-uks-care-homes\">Why did so many people die of Covid-19 in the UK's care homes?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hospital deaths still far exceed care home deaths in England and Wales, both on a cumulative and weekly basis. Although the number of deaths occurring in care homes in Northern Ireland has previously exceeded those in hospitals, cumulatively there have been 350 hospital deaths compared to 313 care home deaths.&nbsp;</p> <p>At first minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday, Nicola Sturgeon was challenged repeatedly by Carlaw about testing in care homes as he noted the latest death figures. She insisted that a programme of regular and routine testing of care home staff was under way and that her government would publish up-to-date data \u201cas soon as we are able to do that in a robust and reliable manner\u201d.</p> <p>Carlaw said the Scottish government\u2019s policy on testing had been \u201cdither, delay and distract\u201d from the start, and that current testing capacity was being \u201csquandered\u201d. He cited one major provider, Renaissance Care, which claims that less than half of its staff have been tested for Covid-19, despite a commitment from the health secretary, Jeane Freeman, two weeks ago that all staff would be routinely tested.</p> <p>The Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, highlighted what he described as a \u201cconsistent disconnect between parliamentary pronouncements and the reality\u201d, referencing cases of care workers still being refused testing unless they are displaying Covid-19 symptoms.</p> <p>In reply to another question, Sturgeon said she had \u201chuge sympathy\u201d for proposals for a national care service, after some MSPs suggested that greater public control of care homes could facilitate the broader reforms that the current crisis has highlighted are desperately needed.</p> <p>Sturgeon has previously guaranteed that the promised public inquiry into the Scottish government\u2019s response to the pandemic would \u201cundoubtedly include what happened in care homes\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>Delroy Lindo has waited 25 years to work with Spike Lee again and Da 5 Bloods gives him one of the best roles of his career. But when he first read the script, the actor had a few questions about his character. Chiefly: \u201cDoes he have to be a Trump supporter?\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>He says: \u201cI remember saying to Spike, \u2018I\u2019ve got a 17-year-old son, man. I don\u2019t want him seeing me representing this person.\u2019\u201d Like Lee, who routinely refers to Donald Trump as Agent Orange, Lindo can barely bring himself to identify the president by name. \u201cIt had to do with my values, as a parent and as a being on the planet, feeling that I would be representing an individual who is ... I don\u2019t have the words to discuss this individual.\u201d Couldn\u2019t the character, he pleaded, just be an arch-conservative? \u201cSpike thought about it for a few days, then said, \u2018Yeah, I really need him to be a Trump supporter.\u2019\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>All the same, the role was just too good to pass up. Lindo plays Paul, one of four African American Vietnam veterans returning, in the modern day, to the country where they fought. Their stated aim is to recover the remains of their fallen comrade, played in flashbacks by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/15/black-panther-chadwick-boseman-interview-everybodys-minds-are-opening-up\">Chadwick Boseman</a>, but they have an ulterior motive, another plan that makes their mission much less laudable. As with Lee\u2019s previous film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/26/blackkklansman-review-spike-lee-blistering-return-to-form\">BlacKkKlansman</a>, Da 5 Bloods is a combustible mix of tones and genres that only he could pull off, combining black history, crime thriller, war movie, character drama, even gory comedy. \u201cFundamentally,\u201d says Lindo, \u201cit\u2019s a love story between these men.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5RDTPfsLAI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/D5RDTPfsLAI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5RDTPfsLAI\">Watch a trailer for Da 5 Bloods</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Lee\u2019s work is always relevant when it comes to African American issues, but arriving at this moment \u2013 with the US rocked by protests and riots over the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> \u2013 Da 5 Bloods resonates in ways even he could not have anticipated. The film highlights the disproportionate nature of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/22/spike-lee-vietnam-da-5-bloods-black-veterans\">African American sacrifice in Vietnam</a>: black people, it claims, made up 11% of the US population but 32% of troops.</p> <p>But it also feeds into issues of black patriotism, inequality and justice. In one flashback, in the Vietnamese jungle, the five comrades learn of the death of Dr Martin Luther King via Hanoi Hannah, the Vietcong propaganda radio broadcaster. She informs them of the widespread rioting back home, and the brutal government response. \u201cWhy you fight against us so far away from where you are needed?\u201d she asks. Lee overlays her speech with archive clips of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2018/aug/19/the-whole-world-is-watching-chicago-police-riot-vietnam-war-regan\">1968 riots</a>. It looks a lot like this week\u2019s news footage.</p> <p>Lindo agrees. He recently attended a rally and has been meeting with young people and sympathetic law enforcement in Oakland, where he lives, on the east side of San Francisco Bay. The rally was peaceful and diverse, he says, which at least gives him some hope that things have progressed since 1968. \u201cThe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">events of the last few days</a> are brilliant examples of taking the hurt, fear, anxiety and rage \u2013 and focusing those things constructively, creatively and humanely, although I am not naive enough to think that things will change, even in the next six months. But I want to believe that the seeds have been planted.\u201d</p> <p>Lindo, now 67, has a calm, authoritative bearing that tends to make everyone quieten down and listen. Over his 45-year career, he has had mostly smaller roles in big movies (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/26/pitch-perfect-get-shorty-at-30-elmore-leonard-dennis-lehane\">Get Shorty</a>, The Cider House Rules, Gone in 60 Seconds, Ransom) and bigger roles in smaller movies (baseball hero Satchel Paige in Soul of the Game, explorer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/24/matthew-henson-arctic-explorer-first-man-to-north-pole\">Matthew Henson</a> in Glory &amp; Honour). But whatever it is that defines actorly \u201cpresence\u201d, Lindo has got it. In real life, he is not so different - at least not in the context of a Zoom conversation from his home. He is serious and thoughtful, choosing his words carefully. Most of the lighter-hearted questions I had prepared go unasked.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cce5da6af3d15eb674194c70a450fcb4540db736\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cce5da6af3d15eb674194c70a450fcb4540db736/0_0_2000_1355/1000.jpg\" alt=\"High point \u2026as gangster West Indian Archie in Malcolm X, with Denzel Washington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"678\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Perfect Jamaican accent \u2026 as gangster West Indian Archie in Malcolm X, with Denzel Washington.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>High points on Lindo\u2019s CV undoubtedly include the three films he made with Lee in the 90s: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/19/malcolm-x-spike-lee-biopic-black-cinema-selma-the-butler\">Malcolm X</a> (in which he played the activist\u2019s criminal mentor), Crooklyn (a struggling father), and Clockers (drug boss). Which poses the question: why did it take so long for them to work together again? \u201cAsk Spike, god doggit!\u201d Lindo says. \u201cWe\u2019ve bumped into each other over the years, and I always say, \u2018Spike, we really need to do something.\u2019 And he says, \u2018Yeah, yeah. We need to do something.\u2019 But if I had to wait 25 years to work with Spike, this is a good one to have waited for.\u201d</p> <p>Lindo plays the most complex and conflicted character of the piece. While his comrades, and Vietnam itself, have moved on from the war, Paul is still living with the trauma and anger, his red MAGA cap a symbol of his bitterness. He gets a striking straight-to-camera monologue towards the end that you can already see fitting into montages at awards ceremonies.</p> <p>Politics aside, Lindo had a great time making the film. Shooting in Thailand and Vietnam was a proper adventure: battle scenes, river journeys (cue Apocalypse Now reference), snakes, landmines, and literally hacking through the jungle with a machete. \u201cOh man. That\u2019s gold for an actor! Getting that machete and \u2013 swish! It\u2019s drama, it\u2019s what we went to acting school for, absolutely.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a82ccc6d8e384ae180dcac0ce010fbcab32c2545\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a82ccc6d8e384ae180dcac0ce010fbcab32c2545/0_0_3086_2008/1000.jpg\" alt=\"London pride \u2026 in 2003 cricket movie Wondrous Oblivion.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"651\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">London pride \u2026 as a father in 2003 cricket movie Wondrous Oblivion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Momentum Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lindo doesn\u2019t know any actual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/12/black-republicans-african-american-voters\">black Trump supporters</a>, but he did manage to get his head around the concept. \u201cI have a cousin who was in \u2019Nam and it still rankles him that he was reviled as a \u2018baby-killer\u2019. So if one extrapolates that kind of rejection, one can end up at a place where you say, \u2018OK, here\u2019s a man, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Trump</a>, who\u2019s saying I\u2019m going to make things right for Americans. I like what he\u2019s saying.\u2019\u201d Lee, for his part, has justified the character on the grounds of both dramatic interest and political diversity. \u201cAll black people do not think alike,\u201d he said recently. \u201cWe\u2019re not one monolithic group.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Lindo\u2019s own identity is not straightforward. He was actually born in Lewisham, London, to parents of Jamaican origin (his ability to do a perfect accent helped land him the role of West Indian Archie in Malcolm X). He spent the first 12 years of his life in the UK before his mother, a nurse, emigrated to Canada then to San Francisco, where he studied acting. He still has an affection for Britain and returns often. In 2003\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,1202552,00.html\">Wondrous Oblivion</a>, he played a cricket-loving Jamaican father in 1960s London.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everything in my life is as a result of leaving England. I could never in a trillion years have had this career there</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He asks about the gentrification of Peckham, worrying it will go the same way as Brixton. But he does not really feel British any longer. \u201cEverything I have achieved in my life has come as a result of leaving England. I could never in a trillion years have had this career in England. Never.\u201d</p> <p>But he would love to work in the UK again. \u201cThere are many components of the black British experience that have not been explored. Is that an accurate thing for me to say?\u201d He\u2019s choosing his words carefully again. \u201cI\u2019m curious to unpack those stories. I have an intense interest in the Windrush period, because my mom was part of that.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, he is familiar with the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">Windrush scandal</a>, in which black British citizens were wrongfully detained and deported to Jamaica by the UK Home Office. \u201cIt felt very, very British,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was disgusting and enraging. For me, it went right to&nbsp;the centre of the British relationship with people of colour and the historical violations that have been visited on them. They manifest slightly differently but British racism is every bit as virulent and violent as American racism. Even with second and third generation black people who were born British citizens, there is still this element of, \u2018You don\u2019t belong here\u2019 and \u2018You are an immigrant.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Even given what\u2019s happening right now in the US? He cites the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence in 1993. \u201cWhen I heard it had happened in Eltham \u2013 where I lived as a child \u2013 it did not surprise me, given incidents that happened to me there.\u201d He also remembers working with playwright <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/kwame-kwei-armah\">Kwame Kwei-Armah</a> in London the early 2000s. Kwei-Armah drove Lindo back to his hotel one evening. \u201cWe were parked outside, talking, and all of a sudden cops descended on us: 20 or 30 cops. They told us to get out and put our hands on the hood and they went through everything in the car. I remember the smirks on their faces. They said they were acting legitimately and I said, \u2018Bullshit. You did this cos there were two black men sitting in a car in a neighbourhood where we didn\u2019t belong.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He laughs and the mood in the room brightens again. \u201cSo y\u2019all have your own problems!\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81045635\">Da 5 Bloods is out on 12 June on Netflix</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The starting point of Jen Brister\u2019s 2018 show&nbsp;Meaningless, now available online from Soho theatre,&nbsp;is that the Brighton comic\u2019s mum has moved in with her. Watching it in the lockdown era, when contact with parents has become verboten for many, you could get dewy-eyed at that. But dewy-eyed isn\u2019t quite how Brister experienced it. Her \u201cdogmatic, confrontational, angry Spanish mum\u201d drives her round the bend, triggering this hour-long tirade about mothers and daughters, \u201cboys are better\u201d and how still, after all these years, women get too small a slice of the pie. \u201cGive me my fucking pie back!\u201d bellows Brister, and the crowd (51% of it, at least) goes wild.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just mum who has focused Brister\u2019s mind \u2013 and her fury. With her partner Chloe, she\u2019s now a mother herself to four-year-old twin boys. Other people\u2019s confusion about same-sex parenting; other mothers\u2019 unwelcome advice about child-rearing \u2013 Brister spits tacks at it all, not least because of its often gendered assumptions. Why don\u2019t we let boys emote? Why can\u2019t girls and women talk about their periods \u2013 far less the menopause, in whose foothills 44-year-old Brister now finds herself?</p> <p>Little of this is new material for standup. The tampon tax has been subject to many a comedian\u2019s protests, and \u201cif men bled\u201d has been the thought experiment of acts from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/sep/26/ben-elton-return-to-standup-comedy\">Ben Elton</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jul/23/michelle-wolf-review-leicester-square-theatre-london\">Michelle Wolf</a>&nbsp;and beyond. But Brister brings a depth of feeling and technical control \u2013 moving from cool intelligence to apoplexy and back \u2013 that leases the material fresh life. There\u2019s likable character work, cartoon portraits of her mum and two sons (one camp; one like Ray Winstone) to offset the cultural politics. And Brister does funny scorn, too, her mimicry of passive-aggressive women and Neanderthal men spilling over into juvenile gibberish.&nbsp;</p> <p>Maybe that device is overused; perhaps there are too many moments when Brister\u2019s intemperate rage is the only joke.

  "<p>More than 250,000 people have signed a petition calling for a ban on cheaply produced low-quality food imports in post-Brexit trade deals.</p> <p>The National Farmers Union (NFU) is lobbying the government to ensure that imports from countries such as the US of food produced to lower standards than expected of UK farmers should not be allowed.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/21/farmers-urge-government-protect-food-standards-trade-bill\">Attempts last month</a> to write a legal minimum standard into the agriculture bill failed, and the NFU has launched the petition to increase pressure on ministers. By Wednesday morning, <a href=\"https://www.nfuonline.com/news/latest-news/food-standards-petition/\">254,764</a> people had put their names to it.</p> <p>The petition says: \u201cFarming throughout the UK has high standards of safety and welfare&nbsp;with an ambition to be net zero in greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. There are very strict controls on farming methods allowed in the UK and I expect the same of all food which is imported here so the food I eat is as safe, traceable and produced to high welfare and environmental standards.</p> <p>\u201cBefore the UK begins to negotiate trade deals with countries around the world, I call on the UK government to put into law rules that prevent food being imported to the UK which is produced in ways that would be illegal here.\u201d</p> <p>Imports that are of particular concern to UK farmers and producers include US poultry products, such as chlorinated chicken and eggs, and hormone-injected beef.</p> <p>The TV chef Jamie Oliver issued a plea on social media for people to sign the petition, saying if there was no law to protect standards, the market would be flooded with very low quality, high salt and sugar products, and that trade deals allowing these imports would be \u201ctraumatic\u201d to the British farming industry.</p> <p>The agriculture bill is moving to the House of Lords. Neil Parish, the chair of the environment food and rural affairs committee, who put forward one of the amendments to the bill in the Commons, said he hoped the Lords would amend the bill in order to protect against substandard imports in trade deals.</p> <p>A Defra spokesperson said:&nbsp;\u201cWe have been clear that in all of our trade negotiations \u2013 including with the US in our first round of negotiations \u2013 that we will not undermine our high domestic environmental protection, animal welfare and food safety standards by ensuring in any agreement British farmers are always able to compete.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In the summer of 1997, I lived in Seattle.

Too often, by default, black people are perceived as threats to white people\u2019s physical safety.&nbsp;And as a consequence, it is our physical safety that is compromised, as the stories of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/26/central-park-new-york-white-woman-black-birdwatcher\">Christian Cooper</a>, the birdwatcher who filmed a white woman in Central Park lying to the cops about how he was threatening her (when all he did was ask her to leash her dog), and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>, the man who died with a police officer\u2019s knee on his neck, illustrate.</p> <p>I have backpacked around the world and lived in Nepal and Kenya, and I\u2019ve seen how my presence can be challenged or questioned. Earlier that year, when I lived in Seattle, I went hiking on Mt Baker with two white friends.&nbsp;It was a typically cloudy and cool day, and we stopped at the park lodge to warm up.&nbsp;At some point, my friends wandered off while I stood there with my colorful shawl wrapped around me.</p> <p>I began to feel uneasy; I noticed an elderly, white woman staring at me.&nbsp;Suddenly, she jumped (as did I).&nbsp;She then said: \u201cMy dear, I thought you were a beautiful, Indian statue.\u201d&nbsp;I was shocked, as I didn\u2019t know whether to feel complimented (you\u2019re beautiful) or insulted (I wasn\u2019t even real).&nbsp;Not to mention her complete misidentification of my racial and ethnic origins.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Regardless of my age and experience, I still feel unsafe walking outside in the country of my birth</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My experiences backpacking through mountain trails and wildlife have forever changed the way I see and engage nature. I have channeled that passion into my work: I completed a PhD in geography, taught classes about the environment in our institutions of higher learning, written about the black experience of the outdoors, served on the national parks advisory board for eight years and work with environmental non-profits and government agencies on diversity and environmental issues.&nbsp;I am invested in finding ways to improve the quality of our relationship with the environment and our relationship to each other. But regardless of my age and experience, I still feel unsafe walking outside in the country of my birth.</p> <p>I wish I could feign surprise at what happened to Christian Cooper when he encountered Amy Cooper in Central Park.&nbsp;I wish I could imagine it to be a blip in the United States\u2019s history; an accident, an outlier, not at all reflective of the truth of how black people are all too often treated.&nbsp;But I can\u2019t.&nbsp;</p> <p>When Amy Cooper threatened to tell the police that \u201can <em>African American</em> man is threatening her life\u201d, she revealed what it\u2019s like to know, deep down in your bones that she would be protected, valued and saved by virtue of her skin color.&nbsp;By calling the police, she exemplified what James Baldwin meant when he said that whiteness is about power.</p> <p>Our outrage as black people is justified.&nbsp;Let me say that again.&nbsp;Our outrage as black people is justified. As the CNN commentator Don Lemon said recently: \u201cThe knee has always been on our neck.\u201d&nbsp;But your outrage, white America, is not enough. What many of us want is fundamental, consequential and absolute change.</p> <p>The response to Amy Cooper by a justifiably angry public \u2013 the demands for her to lose her job, her dog and perhaps some \u201cmembership\u201d in her community \u2013 is frustrating because it leaves me wanting.&nbsp;None of those measures would change the way Christian Cooper or any African American is perceived in any outdoor space, or any space for that matter.</p> <p>The revelations about Christian Cooper having gone to Harvard and how he sits on the board of the New York City Audubon Society (which I\u2019m thrilled to learn) should not matter as much as they seem to. This information helps us understand the passion and commitment he brings to birding. They do not confer his worth. At the end of day, it\u2019s about everyone being protected, valued and if need be, saved, regardless of their station in life.&nbsp;</p> <p>What happened between Amy Cooper and Christian Cooper was, in many ways, simply an echo of what\u2019s always been true in the US about our ability, as black people, to walk in the woods or on a city street.&nbsp;We are all Christian Cooper and George Floyd.&nbsp;</p> <p>What can be done? We should recognize that systemic racism exists on both the streets of our cities and inside our national parks. We have to see full representation at every level in the environmental sector, and we need power structures to shift so that black and brown people are shaping policies and our national conversations. We need predominantly white environmental organizations and academic institutions to be more concerned with how the climate crisis disproportionately impacts black and brown people and give more resources to these communities. We need to change the prison industrial complex and law enforcement, which both undoubtedly shape how black people move through space.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is not about political correctness. These changes must be the product of something learned, understood, believed in and practiced by our institutions, our leaders and our communities.</p> <p>I believe that this country \u2013 which was founded on slavery and stolen land \u2013 can make a different choice, the same way Amy Cooper could have made a different choice. And I can aspire to live in a place where I will not be seen as an anomaly or something to fear or challenge, but instead, am embraced as a reflection of our common humanity that doesn\u2019t deny our differences, but celebrates our possibilities.</p> <ul> <li><p>Carolyn Finney is the author of Black Faces, White Spaces: Reimagining the Relationship of African Americans to the Great Outdoors, and a scholar-in-residence at Middlebury College in Vermont</p></li> <li><p>The opinions expressed here are those of the author.

  "<p>Prosecutors in Scotland have been operating \u201cin cahoots\u201d with so-called paedophile huntings groups, the UK\u2019s supreme court has been told.</p> <p>Lawyers for Mark Sutherland, a paedeophile who is appealing against his conviction using evidence collected by an anti-grooming group in Glasgow, argued there was \u201csystemic, tacit encouragement\u201d by the crown of sting operations where an adult decoy, pretending to be a child, engages with an alleged abuser online.</p> <p>Speaking for the appellant, Gordon Jackson QC said: \u201cThere is huge disquiet about the operation of hunter groups \u2026 you can have all the guidance you like but what we have is a tacit encouragement to these groups because [the crown] prosecutes almost all the cases they bring.\u201d</p> <p>Describing the activities of online child abuse activist groups as \u201cvirtue testing\u201d rather than entrapment, he added: \u201cThe fact it is an abhorrent crime doesn\u2019t make it a legitimate means of gathering evidence.\u201d</p> <p>Following the virtual hearing, which is being following closely by authorities across the UK, the supreme court is expected to rule definitively on whether the covert activities of such groups are legal and compatible with human rights protections.</p> <p>Last summer a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/06/scotlands-child-abuse-activists-we-embrace-the-vigilante-label\">Guardian investigation</a> revealed a surge in cases going through the Scottish courts based on evidence gathered by these groups. The investigation also highlighted significant concerns about how these covert methods sit alongside law enforcement.</p> <p>Alison di Rollo QC, solicitor general for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, Scotland\u2019s prosecution service, which is opposing the appeal, argued that guidance set out \u201cthe risks, the activities, the undesirability of the activities of these groups\u201d and that the usual high standards of investigation were required regardless of the source of the evidence.</p> <p>She insisted: \u201cThe decoy and groups are as liable to criminal prosecution as those against whom, from whom, they obtain evidence.\u201d</p> <p>Di Rollo went on to argue that the criminal prosecution of sexual conduct between an adult and a child did not engage an individual\u2019s rights to privacy, adding: \u201cThere is no right to respect for such behaviour in a democratic society\u201d.</p> <p>This year HM Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland (HMICS) estimated that almost half of online grooming cases resulted from such activities.</p> <p>Sutherland is appealing on the basis that his investigation by the group Groom Resistance Scotland, and the use of the resulting evidence by prosecuting authorities, breached his right to respect for his private life and correspondence under article 8 of the European convention on human rights (ECHR).</p> <p>When Sutherland was tried at Glasgow sheriff court in 2018, the jury heard he had been matched on the dating site Grindr with someone who claimed to be a 13-year-old boy. Sutherland went on to sent him explicit pictures and made arrangements to meet up in person.</p> <p>The person Sutherland had been talking to was in fact a member of Groom Resistance Scotland, and when Sutherland arrived at Partick bus station to meet the boy, he was intercepted by the vigilante group who streamed their encounter live on social media and handed their communications to the police.</p> <p>Sutherland, who was previously imprisoned for similar offences in 2015, was unanimously found guilty of two charges of attempting to communicate indecently with an older child and jailed for two years.</p> <p>In its strategic review of Police Scotland\u2019s response to online child sexual abuse, published in February, HMICS recommended that the police should consider resourcing its own covert work in order to reduce the opportunities for vigilante groups.</p> <p>Oliver Braid, of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/06/scotlands-child-abuse-activists-we-embrace-the-vigilante-label\">Glasgow-based Wolf Pack UK</a>, said: \u201cThe appeal doesn\u2019t seem to have garnered much concern in the community in comparison with other legal matters that teams have faced.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>The Guardian understands that during lockdown, activist groups have continued their activities \u2013 with some reporting an increase in grooming \u2013 but have handed the chat logs they collect directly to the police instead of confronting the alleged paedophiles themselves.</p>",
  "<p>The Cabinet Office ignored warnings that EU citizens living in the UK would be disenfranchised in the May 2019 European parliamentary elections if preparations were not made long before polling day, according to internal documents released during legal action against the government.</p> <p>Details of efforts made by officials to persuade ministers to prepare in advance of voting have been revealed in submissions to the high court in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/12/government-taken-to-court-by-eu-citizens-denied-their-right-to-vote\">a case launched last year by the3million</a>, a group campaigning on behalf of resident EU citizens.</p> <p>Pre-trial exchange of arguments before the judicial review hearing shows that a requirement to fill in a preliminary declaration form \u2013 not needed by EU citizens in another European country \u2013 added to the difficulties for potential voters.</p> <p>As early as 2016, according to Cabinet Office documents, an official in its electoral administration team wrote to colleagues stating: \u201cI have been tasking DexEU [and others] about this to press the point that returning officers want to start preparing for the polls around 18 months out and we either need clarity on participation or a commitment to indemnify them for any nugatory expenditure. My thinking is that we need a decision by the end of 2017.\u201d</p> <p>The following year, the official sent a memorandum in which he cautioned: \u201cIdeally, we would have at least 6 months to prepare for the poll, i.e. from November 2018. After this point, there are increased risks to the successful delivery of a poll.\u201d</p> <p>In May 2018, however, the Cabinet Office wrote to the Electoral Commission to inform it that it \u201cis the government\u2019s position that it would not be prudent for money to be spent preparing for the elections that the government is clear will not take place\u201d.</p> <p>The following March an official said they were \u201cvery close\u201d to a point at which it would be \u201cirresponsible for [local authorities] not to start preparatory work\u201d.</p> <p>In the end, according to lawyers for the3million, as many as 1.7 million EU citizens who had previously registered may have been unable to submit the declaration form in time to vote. The Cabinet Office says there was a higher voter turnout than in previous EU elections.</p> <p>Christiane R\u00e9e, a teacher and German national who had lived in the UK for 24 years, is one of those taking the action. She completed a declaration form but was told it had been lost. </p> <p>\u201cWhen I arrived and asked to vote, I discovered that although my name was on the register it had been crossed out, and I was told that I would not be able to vote,\u201d she said. \u201cMy first reaction was a combination of incredulity and shock.\u201d</p> <p>Maike Bohn, a co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.the3million.org.uk/\">the3million</a>, said: \u201cThe only way to uphold our fundamental right to have a say is to [hold] this government to account.\u201d </p> <p>If the group wins, those unable to vote could each be awarded thousands of pounds in compensation.</p> <p>John Halford, a solicitor at the London law firm Bindmans who is representing the claimants, said: \u201cThe documents brought to light thanks to this litigation reveal a Cabinet Office riven with conflict between officials and ministers about whether EU citizens should be enabled to vote here last year, as was their right.</p> <p>\u201cOfficials gave warning after warning that the UK\u2019s system led to disenfranchisement and needed reform. They urged ministers to make contingency plans for the 2019 elections despite Brexit. Yet ministers abandoned proposed reforms to the system after the 2016 referendum, would not plan for the 2019 elections until it was too late to ensure those who wanted to vote could and, worst of all, adopted a policy that EU citizens should vote anywhere but here.\u201d</p> <p>A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe government put in place all the legislative and funding elements to enable returning officers to make their preparations required for the polls on 23 May \u2013&nbsp;and did so in exceptional circumstances.&nbsp;We cannot comment on the details of an ongoing legal case.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The last major football match played in England before all sport was suspended because of the coronavirus crisis was the European Champions League <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/22/liverpool-atletico-madrid-coronavirus-champions-league\">showpiece between Liverpool and Atletico Madrid</a>. It was a thrilling contest that transfixed 54,000 people under the floodlights of Anfield.</p> <p>But now that match, along with many other mass events that the government allowed to go ahead as the pandemic spread in March, is coming under renewed scrutiny as evidence grows of the lethal danger to which people were exposed. They include rugby matches, horse races, musical concerts and dog shows attended, in total, by hundreds of thousands of Britons.</p> <p>One of those at Anfield was Simon Renoldi, 48, an Essex businessman and pub-restaurant owner. A lifelong Liverpool supporter, he travelled up on the train from Euston station in London with his young son.</p> <p>\u201cWe were in first class on the train, and we passed through a few carriages of Madrid fans, so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s when I caught the virus, or at the game,\u201d he said.

Around 3,000 Atletico supporters were allowed to come from Madrid, a Covid-19 hotspot already, where crowds at football matches <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/22/liverpool-atletico-madrid-coronavirus-champions-league\">had just been banned and schools closed</a>.<br><br>Nobody who has had Covid-19, or the families of almost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-nears-50000-latest-official-figures-show\">50,000 British people</a> who have since died from the virus, can be certain when they caught it. But Renoldi is one of almost 200 people who have contacted the Guardian in recent weeks to say they believe they became infected during the course of a major event in those first two weeks of March.</p> <p>As the death toll in Britain has risen to become the highest in Europe, the initial policy of Boris Johnson\u2019s government \u2013 to dismiss other countries\u2019 rapid responses and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/revealed-the-inside-story-of-uk-covid-19-coronavirus-crisis\">allow the virus to spread</a> \u2013 has been subjected to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/bereaved-families-seek-justice-for-uk-victims-of-coronavirus\">unforgiving scrutiny</a>. Permitting the \u201cmass gatherings\u201d to continue has become an emblem of the government\u2019s inaction, captured most vividly in pictures of teeming crowds at the Cheltenham horse racing festival from 10-13 March.</p> <p>The full impact the events had will never be known, but a broader picture is beginning to emerge. Having examined his evidence, Prof Tim Spector, of the <a href=\"https://covid.joinzoe.com/\">Covid-19 Symptom Study</a>, told the BBC last week that \u201csporting events should have been shut down at least a week earlier, because they\u2019ll have <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52797002\">caused increased suffering and death that wouldn\u2019t otherwise have occurred</a>\u201d.</p> <h2>\u2018I will never forget that day\u2019</h2> <p>Renoldi recalled a landmark football occasion at Anfield that day. \u201cBecause the game was on and the government advice was that it was safe to be held, you couldn\u2019t have kept me away,\u201d he said. \u201cA few days after the match I had it: dry cough, hot sweats, short breath, gritty lungs.\u201d<br><br>When he felt the symptoms, he self-isolated, but then Simon\u2019s father, Gino, 75, who had diabetes and other health issues but was still working at the pub and living above it, fell ill.

It did not respond.<br><br>The other element of the Sage advice is about scale: scientists in the group argue that while mass events look as if they would spread a virus, and some people undoubtedly do become infected, only a small proportion of the population attends, so stopping the events is not significant for a nationwide response to a pandemic. </p> <p>Minutes of Sage meetings published for the first time last week <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/882718/21-potential-impact-behavioural-social-interventions-04032020.pdf\">reveal that</a> as late as 3 March, the scientists advised: \u201cThere is currently no evidence that cancelling large events would be effective.\u201d</p> <p>However, the Johnson government\u2019s decision to allow mass gatherings to take place was not solely because they were considered \u201clow risk\u201d.

The events are outside, and \u201cyou don\u2019t actually come into contact with that many people. So the total number of contacts made in these situations compared with every day in a pub for instance, is really negligible.\u201d</p> <h2>Postcode data</h2> <p>However, there is evidence suggesting mass gatherings did have a significant impact on the spread of the disease.</p> <p>Cheltenham became a coronavirus hotspot in the south-west after the festival, and Liverpool cases rose significantly following the Atletico match. <a href=\"https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/#category=ltlas&amp;map=rate&amp;area=e08000012\">The official government data on </a><a href=\"https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/#category=ltlas&amp;map=rate&amp;area=e08000012\">Covid-19 cases</a>&nbsp;states that on 12 March, there were only nine cases in Liverpool; by 11 April, there were 937. </p> <p>Postcode data <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/lnp/ldrs\">leaked to the Local Democracy Reporting Service</a>&nbsp;showed that on 3 April, the area of GL52, next to Cheltenham racecourse, had the <a href=\"https://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/news/cheltenham-news/leaked-map-shows-postcode-next-4071259\">highest number of hospitalised Covid-19 sufferers in Gloucestershire</a>.

Stopping Cheltenham on its own would not have preserved the UK from the pandemic, but delays in a coherent response made the initial surge more intense, and cost lives.\u201d<br><br>Sir David King, the chief scientific adviser from 2000-07, argues that major events are \u201cideal\u201d spreading episodes. Told by the Guardian that Sage scientists had advised that large gatherings have minimal impact on the spread of the virus, King said: \u201cI find it very difficult to believe scientists said that; I am absolutely astounded.\u201d<br><br>He pointed out that countries that responded well to Covid-19, and kept cases low, banned crowds at events early, including Greece, Hong Kong, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. \u201cYou need to get in early, test, trace and isolate infectious people, take all action to stop the virus spreading. But here they allowed the virus to spread. There is nothing to be said for going down the herd immunity route; it involves so many deaths.\u201d<br><br>The DHSC denied again that it was ever part of its plan to allow the virus to spread and attain herd immunity. </p> <p>A DHSC spokesperson maintained the position stated by Hancock on 16 March: that \u201cthe risks of transmission at mass gatherings such as sporting events are relatively low\u201d. Yet despite that stance, crowds are not being allowed at horseracing or Premier League matches as they restart; health concerns are now expressed about people gathering even outside stadiums without social distancing.<br><br>The DHSC did not acknowledge any mistakes or regret, and issued its standard statement. \u201cThis is an unprecedented global pandemic and we have taken the right steps at the right time to combat it, guided by the latest scientific advice,\u201d it said. \u201cThe government\u2019s clear strategy all along has been to protect our NHS and save lives.\u201d<br><br>Renoldi was at Hillsborough as a Liverpool supporter on 15 April 1989, and survived the terrible crush that killed 96 people.</p> <p>After that disaster, a whole architecture of safety legislation was constructed to protect people from ever again being killed at a sporting event. Those who have lost loved ones as a result of such events going ahead earlier this year are now asking if that public health principle has been overturned.</p> <p>\u201cNow it feels terrible, horrendous,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that match should not have gone ahead. It\u2019s another disaster. The people responsible should be held accountable for the decisions they took, and lessons learned so this can never happen again.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Caroline Bannock</em></p>",
  "<p>The supreme court has ordered the re-trial of a long-running libel case after finding that a high court judge, Mr Justice Jay, subjected the unrepresented claimant to a \u201cbarrage of hostility\u201d and offensive language.</p> <p>The unanimous ruling by five justices in the claim, which involved an article published in a Polish community newspaper, potentially expands the public interest defence for journalists in defamation cases.</p> <p>Jan Serafin, now 68, who ran a cafe in a Polish community centre in Hammersmith, west London, originally sued the Polish-language monthly Nowy Czas (New Time) for libel over an article published about him in October 2015.</p> <p>He claimed the story had 13 separate defamatory meanings, including that he had abused his position to award himself or his company contracts for maintenance work and had diverted to himself funds needed for a care home.</p> <p>Jay found that in relation to all 13 meanings the defendants had established a defence to the claim under the 2013 Defamation Act on the grounds that each of them was on a matter of public interest and it was reasonable for the newspaper to have believed that publishing them was in the public interest. </p> <p>The court of appeal subsequently overturned that ruling in relation to one of the more serious complaints.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2013/may/08/leveson-robert-jay-high-court-judge\">Jay</a> rose to prominence as counsel to the televised Leveson inquiry into phone-hacking, where his rich vocabulary included such rarely used words as \u201cbailiwick\u201d, \u201ccondign\u201d, \u201cpropinquity\u201d and \u201cocclude\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2020/23.html\">In its decision on Wednesday</a>, the supreme court found that Jay did not allow the claim to be properly presented. Delivering judgment, Lord Wilson said: \u201cWhen one considers the barrage of hostility towards the claimant\u2019s case, and towards the claimant himself acting in person, fired by the judge in immoderate, ill-tempered and at times offensive language at many different points during the long hearing, one is driven [to conclude] \u2026 that he did not allow the claim to be properly presented; that therefore he could not fairly appraise it; and, that, in short, the trial was unfair.</p> <p>\u201cInstead of making allowance for the claimant\u2019s appearance in person, the judge harassed and intimidated him in ways which surely would never have occurred if the claimant had been represented \u2026 Conscious of how the justice system has failed both sides, this court, with deep regret, must order a full retrial.\u201d</p> <p>In relation to the scope of the public interest defence, the justices re-examined the defence established in the controversial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/oct/17/libel-reform-court-of-appeal\">Reynolds v</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/oct/17/libel-reform-court-of-appeal\"> Times Newspapers case</a>, which was understood to have set standards for what was deemed \u201cresponsible journalism\u201d.</p> <p>The justices said the checklist in the Reynolds case used in libel defences should not be regarded as absolutely binding. For example, Wilson said, \u201ca failure to invite comment from the claimant prior to publication will no doubt always at least be the subject of consideration \u2026 but it is, with respect, too strong to describe the prior invitation to comment as a \u2018requirement\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>David Price QC, who acted for the Polish newspaper, said afterwards he hoped that the judgment would \u201crebalance the law in favour of freedom of expression\u201d. </p>",

Yemen\u2019s five-year-old war has also drawn in western powers which sell arms and supply technical assistance to the Saudi-led coalition.&nbsp;</p> <p>The STC and the Yemeni government called for a \u201ctransparent\u201d investigation into Quaety\u2019s death.</p> <p>Several journalists in Yemen have been killed in airstrikes and bombings during the war, and hundreds more imprisoned, tortured or forced to flee the country. Quaety\u2019s killing appears to be the first targeted killing of a media worker since 2015, when the journalist Abdel Karim al-Khaiwani was shot dead in Sana\u2019a in an attack claimed by al-Qaida.&nbsp;</p> <p>Quaety\u2019s support for the STC was frequently criticised by members of Islah, a Muslim Brotherhood-linked bloc of the Yemeni government, who also accused him of being funded by the UAE.&nbsp;</p> <p>On Tuesday there were tributes to Quaety on social media, as well as allegations that Islah was behind the killing.&nbsp;</p> <p>Fatima Abo Alasrar, a non-resident fellow at the US-based Middle East Institute, said: \u201cThis is such a shocking incident. It will have political implications and increase the sense of vulnerability and collective grievances [of southerners]. It might be too presumptuous to pin this on the Islah party because there are other political players in the south, including [President Abd Rabbu Mansour] Hadi supporters, who want to suppress the STC voice. This is why a fair investigation is badly needed.\u201d</p> <p>Quaety was a finalist in 2016 in Britain\u2019s Rory Peck awards for freelance journalists, for work the judges described as \u201crare and outstanding\u201d.</p> <p>Last year he survived a Houthi drone attack on a military base near Aden that killed six soldiers.&nbsp;</p> <p>He leaves behind a pregnant wife and three children.&nbsp;</p> <p>AFP\u2019s global news director, Phil Chetwynd, said: \u201cWe are shocked by the senseless killing of a courageous journalist doing his job despite threats and intimidation. Through his work with AFP over the past five years, Nabil had helped to show a global audience the full horror of the conflict in Yemen. The quality of his work had been widely recognised. The thoughts of everybody at AFP are with his wife and children today.\u201d</p> <p>Yemen ranks 167th out of 180 countries listed in Reporters Without Borders\u2019 world press freedom index. Four media workers are facing the death penalty in Sana\u2019a after being accused of spying.&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p>Boris Johnson has said he is \u201cvery proud\u201d of the government\u2019s record on the coronavirus, during a prime minister\u2019s questions at which Keir Starmer repeatedly pressed him on his leadership over the issue.</p> \n<p>Johnson, who announced a new commitment for the vast majority of Covid-19 tests to be processed within 24 hours, complained several times about what he called a negative approach from the Labour leader. In response, Starmer said the prime minister was \u201cconfusing scrutiny for attack\u201d.</p> \n<p>Starmer \u2013 who began by expressing surprise that Johnson had not noted the death of George Floyd and the subsequent unrest in the US during his opening remarks \u2013 started his questions by referring to <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/06/02/exclusive-boris-johnson-takes-back-control-coronavirus-crisis/\">a Daily Telegraph article</a> which said Johnson was revamping cabinet committees to \u201ctake control\u201d of the response to the coronavirus.</p> \n<p>Starmer asked: \u201cSo an obvious question for the prime minister: who\u2019s been in direct control up till now?\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson replied: \u201cI take full responsibility for everything this government has been doing in tackling coronavirus, and I\u2019m very proud of our record. If you look at what we have achieved so far, it is very considerable. We have protected the NHS, we have driven down the death rate. We are now seeing far fewer hospital admissions.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cI think what the country would like to hear from him is more signs of cooperation in that endeavour.\u201d</p> \n<p>Starmer responded to the latter comment by saying he had written to Johnson two weeks ago to ask whether he could \u201chelp build the consensus\u201d on pupils returning to school, saying: \u201cI did it confidentially because I didn\u2019t want to make a lot of it. He hasn\u2019t replied.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Labour leader asked Johnson about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/01/public-trust-in-uk-government-over-coronavirus-falls-sharply\">a report that levels of trust in the government</a> had dropped notably since revelations about the lockdown movements of Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, and about the new test and trace system.</p> \n<p>A sometimes irritated-sounding Johnson said he was \u201csurprised\u201d at Starmer\u2019s approach. He accused the Labour leader of being obstructive, and diminishing the efforts of people involved in track and trace. \u201cHis attempts to distract the public from that have not been successful,\u201d Johnson said.</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cI really do not see the purpose of his endless attacks on public trust and confidence.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Starmer replied: \u201cThe prime minister is confusing scrutiny for attack. I have supported the government, openly, and I\u2019ve taken criticism for it. But boy, he makes it difficult to support this government over the last two weeks.\u201d</p> \n<p>Starmer ended by asking why lockdown restrictions were eased on Monday when the government\u2019s coronavirus warning level remained on four, something Johnson had previously said would not happen.</p> \n<p>Johnson replied: \u201cHe knows perfectly well that the alert level does allow it.\u201d</p> \n<p>The former health secretary Jeremy Hunt later asked the PM if he could make a commitment to all Covid-19 tests being completed within a day.</p> \n<p>Johnson said: \u201cI can undertake to him now to get all tests turned around within 24 hours by the end of June, except for difficulties with postal tests or insuperable problems like that.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The family of a former senior Saudi intelligence official have told of their anguish over the disappearance of two of his adult children in Riyadh, in what has been described to the Guardian as an act of vengeance by the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, to force the official\u2019s return from exile.</p> <p>The disappearance of Omar and Sarah Aljabri, son and daughter of Saad and Nadyah Aljabri, in March showed how Saudi\u2019s de facto ruler had used the children of his perceived enemies against them, said Khalid Aljabri, the siblings\u2019 older brother.</p> <p>Their father, Saad Aljabri, 61, is a retired intelligence official who was the longtime right-hand man of Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the former crown prince who was deposed when Prince Mohammed became crown prince.

Press accounts have also quoted Saudi rumours that Aljabri stole from the kingdom and has secret allegiances with the Muslim Brotherhood. The family staunchly deny the claims.</p> <p>\u201cWe have evidence to prove that any allegations are politically motivated. We would welcome any legal challenge.

But for the Aljabri family, the disappearances are a personal disaster.</p> <p>The family\u2019s entanglement with Prince Mohammed began in 2017. Saad Aljabri had already fled the kingdom in the hope \u2013 according to Khalid \u2013 of steering clear of what the family has called the Game of Thrones-style jockeying between Mohammed bin Salman and Mohammed bin Nayef.</p> <p>Sarah and Omar were the only members of the family \u2013 six brothers and two sisters in total \u2013 who had stayed behind as they waited for their US student visas to be approved.</p> <p>According to the family\u2019s account, Mohammed bin Salman reached out to Saad Aljabri days before he became crown prince and sought to convince him to return, saying he was needed and would be promoted.</p> <p>Aljabri was suspicious of the offer. He stalled and said he would return in a matter of weeks. When Prince Mohammed assumed the role of crown prince days later, Khalid and his family urged Sarah and Omar to get out.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we did is told the kids to take their passports and go to the airport,\u201d Khalid said.</p> <p>Omar, who was 18 at the time, was let through security with an exit stamp.

It tells you what intention he had with my dad,\u201d said Khalid. \u201cWe did not know if it was a temporary measure or if it was going to last forever.\u201d</p> <p>In a direct communication from Prince Mohammed in September 2017, Saad Aljabri was told that he would have to return to Saudi if he wanted his children to be allowed to travel.</p> <p>Saad Aljabri and his wife headed for Canada while Omar and Sarah stayed in Riyadh and returned to their school.</p> <p>Sarah is described by her brother as a studious and shy young woman who doted on her father when she was growing up, never missing a chance to have breakfast with him. Khalid said Omar is strong-willed and \u201cwise beyond his age\u201d, always keen to try to win an argument and always the centre of a party.</p> <p>The distance took its toll. \u201cThroughout that time, we were still pursuing peaceful mediation but our lives were totally different. At every lunch and dinner, every birthday, seats were always empty,\u201d Khalid said.</p> <p>Nadyah Aljabri would spend hours on the phone with her teenage daughter, often calling late at night as Sarah was waking up in Riyadh, and nudging her to get to school on time.</p> <p>\u201cThe only comfort we had were calls and texts and video calls.

He then rode through the crowd on a police horse. One of his main groups of supporters, 300 do Brasil, has camped in the capital.

In a public letter, the officers intimated that there was a possibility of \u201ccivil war\u201d. The press is also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/brazil-media-boycott-bolsonaro-residence-abuse-of-reporters-suspend-reporting-president-supporters\">under attack</a>, transformed<strong>&nbsp;</strong>into an enemy of Brazil by Bolsonaro.&nbsp;</p> <p>The real Brazil never corresponded to the cliched image of a gentle giant, projected for export. But not even the most pessimistic Brazilian could have predicted that in 17 months<strong> </strong> Bolsonaro would hijack all the country\u2019s joy and creative power. A rising number now think it is easier to survive the virus than the president.</p> <p>Brazil today is masked in hatred. But there are other Brazils, and they resist.&nbsp;This weekend, previously irreconcilable figures from the left and right and from all walks of life released a manifesto in which they declared that two-thirds of Brazilians want a government that respects the constitution and want to feel \u201cjoy and pride in being&nbsp;Brazilian once again\u201d.

And Johnson, at least on the face of it, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/15/labour-welcomes-pms-conversion-on-obesity-after-coronavirus-scare\">has changed his mind</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/15/labour-welcomes-pms-conversion-on-obesity-after-coronavirus-scare\">Labour welcomes PM's 'conversion' on obesity after coronavirus scare</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Obesity was a problem before Covid-19, but this is an infectious disease that hits obese people disproportionately hard, no matter their income.</p> \n<p>Countries with high obesity rates from western Europe to the US are struggling to keep people alive in intensive care units. Britain, long described as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/feb/18/doctors-soft-drinks-tax-obesity\">the fat man of Europe</a>\u201d also has the highest number of Covid-19 deaths in Europe. Almost 30% of adults in the UK are classed as obese. The figure is nearly 40% in the US, where Covid deaths have topped 100,000.</p> \n<p>It is striking, experts say, that wealthy countries appear to have higher mortality rates than impoverished ones. Africa so far has not experienced the explosion of deaths that Europe has. There will be many factors, and absence of good data collection will be one. But low rates of obesity, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/24/type-2-diabetes-uk-obesity-crisis-nhs\">type 2 diabetes</a> and the chronic disease of the heart and other organs are likely to play a part.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"134c6037-2f86-41ab-a672-1986189fb60e\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/closed-borders-and-black-weddings-what-the-1918-flu-teaches-us-about-coronavirus\">1918 influenza pandemic</a>&nbsp;that killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics.</p>\n    <p>How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/singapore-coronavirus-increase-revives-fears-of-post-lockdown-surge\">resurgence in infections</a>&nbsp;despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.</p>\n    <p>Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/singapores-cramped-migrant-worker-dorms-hide-covid-19-surge-risk\">cramped dormitory accommodation</a>&nbsp;used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.</p>\n    <p>Singapore\u2019s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are experts worried about?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.</p>\n    <p>The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.</p>\n    <p>In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-we-have-one\">a vaccine still months away</a>, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterbeaumont\"><b>Peter Beaumont</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Prof Barry Popkin, a professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Public Health in the US, says obesity \u201cweakens greatly our immune system\u201d.</p> \n<p>The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control says 73% of critically ill patients with Covid-19 in Italy, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the Netherlands are obese.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In the UK, according to Prof John Wilding, the president of the <a href=\"https://www.worldobesity.org/\">World Obesity Federation</a>, obesity doubles the chances of death.</p> \n<p>The non-profit organisation is publishing a dossier of evidence and guidance about obesity in Covid-19 on its website on Wednesday, setting out what has been established so far.</p> \n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.06.20092999v1\">a yet to be peer-reviewed study of the electronic health records of 17 million adult NHS patients</a>, the risk of a coronavirus-related hospital death increases from between 1.5 to 2 times for people with a body mass index of 30, which is the lowest level of obesity, to more than 2 for those with a BMI of 40 or more. \u201cIt is a very significant increase,\u201d says Wilding . \u201cAnd the reasons for that are probably pretty complicated.\u201d</p> \n<p>Although not an intensive care doctor, Wilding says one of the reasons is the difficulty ventilating somebody who is obese.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s much harder to ventilate you effectively if you have a higher bodyweight. The lung capacity for the body size is lower, so there\u2019s less reserve in the system. So of course, if you do have a severe respiratory infection, that affects the ability of the lungs to help get oxygen into the blood. The system is going to have to work a lot harder for you than it is for somebody who is much lighter and much smaller.\u201d</p> \n<p>It could make sense to advise everyone who is morbidly obese to shield \u2013 but GPs do not always put people on the scales or keep a record. So there is no register of who they are.</p> \n<p>When Johnson was admitted to St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London with Covid-19, he was reported to have weighed 17-and-a-half stone (111kg), which would have given him a BMI of about 36. BMI is a ratio of weight to height: 18.5 to 25 is normal and 30 is obese.</p> \n<p>Over 40 is morbid obesity \u2013 and the point at which people can be referred to specialist care and may be eligible for bariatric surgery to reduce their stomach size. Johnson was vulnerable when he was infected \u2013 and he appears to have recognised his weight was a factor.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind on this. We need to be much more interventionist,\u201d he told senior ministers and advisers, according to the Spectator\u2019s political editor, James Forsyth.</p> \n<p>This is exactly what doctors at the British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society (BOMSS) have been waiting to hear; they have long feared that the UK is not taking the condition seriously.</p> \n<p>Hospitals deal with the consequences of obesity \u2013 such as soaring rates of type 2 diabetes, blindness and amputations \u2013 and the cost to the NHS is high. But the UK offers only a tenth of the stomach-reducing surgery that France does: 6,000 operations a year compared with 60,000.</p> \n<p>Prof David Kerrigan, the president of BOMSS, and colleagues wrote an open letter to the prime minister to draw his attention to last year\u2019s call by the Royal College of Physicians for obesity to be recognised as a disease \u2013 not a lifestyle choice.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere has been a curious reluctance on the part of the NHS to grasp this particular nettle,\u201d they said, adding that bariatric surgery to shrink the stomach and reduce appetite was often regarded as a \u201cquick fix\u201d.</p> \n<p>But \u201ca quick fix is precisely what is needed if we are to avoid needless suffering, ICU admission and death in patients with obesity who subsequently become infected with Sars-CoV-2\u201d, they wrote to Johnson.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/06/how-weight-loss-surgery-saved-my-life\">How weight loss surgery saved my life</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Like so much of Covid-19, it is unclear why people who are obese are at higher risk of severe illness.</p> \n<p>Shaw Somers, a consultant bariatric surgeon and a former BOMSS president, says people who are overweight have what is known as a pro-inflammatory state.</p> \n<p>\u201cExcess fatty tissue, when it reaches a certain point, starts to secrete certain hormones which make your body think that it\u2019s inflamed. When it becomes extremely severe, at very, very heavy weight, it is the thing that drives the damage to all their organs. Their body thinks it\u2019s chronically inflamed and this just basically trashes a lot of their essential systems like the kidneys, the lungs, the heart, etc,\u201d Somers says.</p> \n<p>\u201cWith severe obesity, your immune system is working overtime. What we know from Covid is, those who do badly have an exaggerated inflammatory response that comes on after seven to 10 days. Their immune system goes berserk and kills them. And we think that obesity just amplifies it and just makes it much worse.\u201d</p> \n<p>People who are obese also fare worse if they get Sars, flu or pneumonia. The highest risk is with the highest BMI, but it is a sliding scale. Even those who are overweight, with a BMI of 25, are running health risks.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you look at the prime minister, for instance, his BMI is 36. So it\u2019s not far from 40, where he\u2019d be eligible for NHS treatment,\u201d says Somers. \u201cIf his BMI is 36 and he got another illness like blood pressure or diabetes, he would be eligible for NHS treatment for his obesity.</p> \n<p>\u201cEven someone who is maybe a couple of stone overweight will have a degree of impairment of the body function and the degree of impairment of the resilience of their body. Because of that obesity, they may not be aware of it until they get serious illness like Covid-19, such as bad influenza. Then it will hit them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Somers says the UK should be treating far more people who cannot reduce their weight by themselves. It does not have to involve surgery. He talks about the gastric balloon, for example, which is swallowed in a deflated state and then inflated to the size of a grapefruit in the stomach. Four months later, it effectively disintegrates and is passed in the normal fashion.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Wilding hopes that people will be thinking of living healthier lifestyles as we come out of lockdown.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe would encourage people to try and eat a healthier range of foods, fresh foods, and try and make sure the constraints we\u2019ve all had to go through are not actually putting us at even higher risk of developing severe infection or severe illness from coronavirus because we put on weight while sitting at home worrying about it,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>In the aftermath of Covid-19, it is likely that more people will cycle and walk in order to avoid crowded trains, tubes and buses. More dedicated cycle lanes may be built.</p> \n<p>The link between obesity and Covid-19 may encourage better nutrition, curbs on junk food and better access to obesity treatment for far more people when they need it.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are some positive things that can come out of this,\u201d Wilding says.</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s been proposed, probed and pushed to the margins of the European Union for more than two decades. Now, as Europe reels from tens of thousands of coronavirus deaths and millions of lost jobs in the worst recession for generations, ministers from Spain, Italy and Portugal say the time has come to revive a radical idea: a pan-EU minimum income.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the moment for debates about social protection,\u201d Pablo Iglesias, Spain\u2019s deputy prime minister for social rights and leader of Podemos, told the Guardian. \u201cAnyone who finds themselves in a vulnerable situation should have access to protection mechanisms that allow them to fill their fridge and care for their family.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>The measure, Iglesias argues, could <a href=\"https://www.eapn.eu/poverty-watch-the-reality-of-poverty-and-social-exclusion-in-the-eu-the-summary-report-is-out/\">protect </a><a href=\"https://www.eapn.eu/poverty-watch-the-reality-of-poverty-and-social-exclusion-in-the-eu-the-summary-report-is-out/\"> more than 113 million people who face poverty</a> and social exclusion in the EU and offer a safety net as the coronavirus pandemic threatens to pull millions more into poverty.</p> <p>He has joined forces with the labour ministers for Italy and Portugal, Nunzia Catalfo and Ana Mendes Godinho, to call for a common EU approach to minimum income. The measure would pave the way for the bloc\u2019s 450 million residents to receive a top-up if their income falls below a certain level.&nbsp;</p> <p>What the trio are putting forward is the idea; the hope is that EU governments will come together to hash out how it would be funded, the minimum income amount, and eligibility.</p> <p>\u201cEurope is currently facing the greatest challenge in its history since the second world war,\u201d the ministers <a href=\"https://www.lavanguardia.com/economia/20200508/481016963163/hacia-un-ingreso-minimo-europeo.html\">wrote </a>in a recent opinion article published in several newspapers. \u201cA coordinated European response is needed to avoid a new economic and social crisis like what we lived through after the 2008 crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Their push echoes an open letter, signed by 25 members of the European Parliament in April, calling on the EU to respond to the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d impact of the virus by proposing a minimum income of at least 60% of median disposable household income.</p> <p>\u201cThis money would reach the most vulnerable families in Europe and become a direct transfer of resources through consumption in local services and shops,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.eapn.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EAPN-EAPN-Covid19-Minimum-Income-letter-to-Commissioner-Schmit-24-April-final-4366.pdf\">the letter noted, adding that </a>support for a minimum income had been steadily growing prior to the pandemic. \u201cIt is clear that the political tide is turning with the Covid-19 crisis.\u201d</p> <p>The push comes as the Spanish government prepares this week to roll out its <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-spain-poverty/spain-to-fight-poverty-with-income-scheme-for-25-mln-people-idUSL8N2D3366\">first nationwide minimum income</a>, with plans to spend \u20ac3bn annually to top up monthly income for 850,000 households or 2.3 million individuals.

He pointed to Italy\u2019s minimum income programme and the scrutiny it faced from the EU last year when tensions rose over the country\u2019s deficit within the eurozone. \u201cIf you tell member states they must have adequate minimum income schemes, then you cannot later tell them to cut that kind of scheme to meet budget constraints.\u201d</p> <p>In Spain, where the fallout from the pandemic has left hundreds queueing for food aid and decimated industries such as tourism, Iglesias was hopeful the crisis would fuel a final push towards an idea that had long been percolating in the EU.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about is addressing the situation of broad sectors of society who are in a situation of vulnerability and need some sort of income to access a minimum level of dignity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be an international reference of what the European Union stands for.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The coronavirus pandemic has laid bare some of the worst inequities in the US, not least the shortcomings in the US childcare system.

We have considerable <a href=\"http://www.cirje.e.u-tokyo.ac.jp/research/workshops/macro/macropaper16/macro0127.pdf\">research</a> evidence of the negative effect of childcare cost on female labor force participation,\u201d said Francine Blau, a professor of economics and labor relations at Cornell University. \u201cAmong people who are employed, it leaves them with less income to cover other expenses they face such as rent and food, so it squeezes them.\u201d</p> <p>The expense of having children in the US has <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-birthrate-decline-millennials-delay-having-kids-2019-5\">contributed</a> to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-birthrates-fall-to-record-low-11589947260\">record low </a>birthrates, while median wages for US male and female workers <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-thriving-middle-class-life-requires-more-than-a-years-income/\">lag behind</a> the cost of basic living necessities.

Now her family relies solely on the income of her husband, who makes around $50,000 a year in warehousing.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe loss of my income has made it difficult for us to keep up on our bills. I worked well into my third trimester to try to mitigate the damage but it didn\u2019t do much except make me tired,\u201d said Gaona. \u201cEvery month it seems like a mad dash just to keep the lights on. My husband and I often skip meals to make sure our kids are getting enough food.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>As parents are struggling to afford childcare and find providers, those who work in childcare face low pay throughout the industry. A June 2018 report by the University of California-Berkeley found<a href=\"https://cscce.berkeley.edu/files/2018/06/Early-Childhood-Workforce-Index-2018.pdf\"> 58%</a> of childcare workers in California rely on one or more public assistance programs. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/personal-care-and-service/childcare-workers.htm\">median wage </a>for childcare workers in the US is $11.17 an hour, just over $23,000 a year.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been working in childcare for over 10 years now, and only until two years ago I started getting paid $15 an hour, and that was after working full-time while going to school at night just to earn my associate\u2019s degree in early childhood education,\u201d said Emily Best, 29, who works in childcare outside of Boston, Massachusetts. \u201cSomehow myself and so many others like me are looked at as glorified babysitters and our pay reflects that. At this rate, I can\u2019t afford to have a child of my own since it would take two-thirds of my income just to send them to my own classroom.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>During the pandemic, Best has continued working at an emergency daycare center, though with a reduced work schedule.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re all worried about what happens when we \u2018go back\u2019. Will all of the families still want to send their kids? Will we all still have jobs?\u201d Best said.&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p>Health and social care workers could be asked to volunteer to look after people with Covid-19 without wearing protective equipment in the event of extreme shortages, according to proposals seen by the Guardian.</p> <p>Councils oversee a range of services which require PPE but which are outside the NHS supply chain. These include care homes, pharmacies, mortuary and funeral services, children\u2019s homes and community mental health services. While these services have access to the national PPE stockpile there are sometimes&nbsp;shortages of key items. The PPE situation in NHS hospitals has improved since the start of the pandemic but gaps in community provision continue.</p> <p>Southampton city council has drawn up an ethical framework document to help councils plan for further waves of the pandemic.</p> <p>One proposal contained in internal documents marked \u201csensitive\u201d from a council planning to adopt the Southampton blueprint, shows that in the event of extreme shortages using PPE that has not been approved by regulators could be considered.</p> <p>In the event of having no PPE available at all, staff could be asked to volunteer to care for people who have or may be infected with Covid-19, without protective equipment.</p> <p>The document suggests that health and care workers who have already had Covid-19 may be suitable volunteers for this high-risk practice although it states that staff should not be put under undue pressure and that human rights legislation should be taken into account.</p> <p>The Unison senior national officer Gavin Edwards&nbsp;condemned the proposals. He said: \u201cExpecting care staff to work without safety kit&nbsp;would be a short-sighted and dangerous gamble. There would then be little, if anything, to stop the spread of the virus to staff, the people they care for and the wider community.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Jasmine Ho of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.medsupplydrive.org.uk/\">Med Supply Drive</a>, a group of doctors responding to requests to source PPE for staff in hospitals and community settings, said 81% of its requests had come from community and social care providers. \u201cSome of the people who contact us requesting PPE sound quite desperate,\u201d said Ho. \u201cThere is a strong likelihood that there will be a second wave of Covid and we should be prepared. We find it unacceptable that more than 200 healthcare workers have died. In this local authority guidance it is incredibly irresponsible to be thinking about asking people to volunteer to work without PPE in a situation where none is available.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Jenny Vaughan, law and policy lead&nbsp;at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dauk.org/\">Doctors\u2019 Association</a>, said: \u201cNobody should be put at unnecessary risk just for going in and doing their job.

  "<p>Four men have won the sprint triple of 100m, 200m and 4x100m at the Olympics and, chances are, you know three of them: Jesse Owens, Carl Lewis and Usain Bolt. Then there is Bobby Joe Morrow, who died last weekend at the age of 84. When Morrow won all three at the Melbourne Games in 1956 he was, briefly, as famous as any of the others. He was a guest on the Ed Sullivan show, same episode as Marcel Marceau, and Arthur Godfrey and His Friends, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=x0EEAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">he made the cover of Life magazine</a> and was even named by the US Chamber of Commerce as one of nine Great Living Americans, right alongside Cecil B DeMille and Norman Rockwell.</p> <p>Sports Illustrated made him <a href=\"https://vault.si.com/vault/1957/01/07/sportsman-of-1956\" title=\"\">its sportsman of 1956</a>, the same year Floyd Patterson became the youngest heavyweight champion in history and Mickey Mantle won the triple crown for the Yankees. Morrow was 21 years old, tall, handsome, and \u201cthe Beau Ideal of the US Olympic team\u201d. He grew up on a farm in San Benito, way down in south-east Texas, his father was an elder in the Church of Christ, and the family were \u201cprosperous, unostentatious, and deeply religious\u201d. The way they told it, his only vice was ice cream. It made him something \u201ca little larger than a fine sprinter\u201d.

Reading all this back now, alongside the few scant paragraphs that have been published in the papers since his death, it feels like Bobby Morrow\u2019s wasn\u2019t a story about the rewards of fame but the costs. But then he would likely scoff at that, just as he seemed to at almost everything else that was written about him.</p> <p>He could always run. In his last year of high school he covered 100 yards in 9.6sec, hand-timed. He was something to see, in those days. \u201cHe was the most beautiful runner anyone ever saw,\u201d said his first wife, Jo Ann Richey. \u201cSo relaxed, so graceful, like when he was chasing rabbits back on the farm.\u201d Morrow\u2019s coach at Abilene Christian University reckoned he \u201ccould run a 220 with a root beer float on his head and never spill a drop\u201d.

In Melbourne he became the first man since Owens to win three gold medals in the sprints, set an Olympic record in the 200m and anchored the 4x100m team to a world record.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1996fa0010d6e3d45caaef9aeaa3fff213add1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1996fa0010d6e3d45caaef9aeaa3fff213add1b/22_343_2915_1750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thane Baker (centre) hands the baton to Bobby Joe Morrow in the first heat of the 4x100 in Melbourne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thane Baker (centre) hands the baton to Bobby Joe Morrow in the first heat of the 4x100 in Melbourne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SF/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Morrow intended to defend his Olympic titles at Rome in 1960, when he was 25. But he strained a muscle before the trials and, running injured, finished last in his 100m heat. Still, the head coach invited him along to the team\u2019s training camp and told him that if his leg got better they would find a space for him on the relay team. It did, but they didn\u2019t. The day before the team were due to fly to Rome they said they still hadn\u2019t made a decision, and that he should come along to the airport the next morning. When he did, they finally told him he wasn\u2019t going. Richey said the humiliation he felt was a cause of their divorce years later.</p> <p>They had twins, and Morrow, who had quit a bank job so he could train full-time, found he was struggling to support them. He had railed against the Amateur Athletics Union\u2019s strict rules limiting earnings, and the hypocrisy of the men who enforced them, like the International Olympic Committee president Avery Brundage. He saw how the officials \u2013 \u201ca bunch of guys whose job was to hand out soap and towels, because they had to find something for them to do\u201d \u2013 enjoyed first-class flights and accommodation while the athletes were living on $15 per diem. </p> <p>Morrow met the US attorney general Robert Kennedy to petition him about it, and then testified at a senate hearing on the subject. Nothing changed, except that he got even angrier about the way he had been treated.</p> <p>So Morrow started looking for other ways to make money. A conman named Max Nunn roped him into a snake oil business selling a \u201cmineral potion\u201d called Stim-o-Stam. \u201cAll the friends I sold stock to lost their money,\u201d he told William Martin, \u201cpeople that didn\u2019t really have money, that had to go out and borrow it to put it in.\u201d He fell in with the infamous Church of Christ fraudster Billie Sol Estes, too. Then he was caught up in a third scandal when he was recruited by a phoney organisation called the Higher Education Crusade.</p> <p>\u201cAgain, somebody was using my name to do their dirty work,\u201d he told Martin. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any control over it but, of course, my name was connected with the company as representing them. I felt lousy, really.

By the time he spoke to Martin, Morrow had remarried, and was living back on his family farm. Still, he said he was sorry he had ever won the medals, that he would have been happier if he\u2019d been \u201cjust another man in the street\u201d. He was inducted into the National Track &amp; Field hall of fame in 1989, and San Benito high school named its football stadium after him in 2006.</p> <p>You like to think that, in the end, he found a measure of happiness in his obscurity \u2013 but perhaps that, too, is just a bit of wishful thinking, another of the stories we tell ourselves about our heroes.</p>",

That is roughly equal to the rate which <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/symptoms/complications.html\">measles kills children</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The coronavirus represents an especially contagious and deadly disease.</p> \n<p>Compared with <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2009758\">past coronavirus outbreaks</a>, Covid-19 is spread much more easily among people who show no symptoms, known as asymptomatic carriers. The virus is especially contagious, because of how it is shed from the upper respiratory tract \u2013 or the part of the body used to chant, cry and cough.&nbsp;Although death rates vary across countries, they <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality\">remain high</a>.</p> \n<p>Protesters or police shouting at the top of their lungs could spread viral droplets for which masks are a weak barrier. Holding hands could also spread contagion. Corralling protesters together makes social distancing impossible. And thousands of people circulating together make contact tracing all but impossible.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Protests have also shut down testing sites in some cities and states, including in Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Jacksonville, Florida, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-pulse/2020/06/02/covid-19-testing-sites-shutter-amid-protests-788135\">Politico reported</a>.</p> \n<p>At the same time, police tactics threaten to accelerate the spread of Covid-19. The use of teargas and pepper sprays are a public health nightmare. Both cause incessant coughing. Oil-based pepper sprays cause tears, mucus and saliva to pour from the eyes, nose and mouth.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Teargas and pepper spray \u201cwould be the last agent I would use during this time period, for that reason,\u201d said Markel. \u201cYou amplify the possibility of spread.\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Quickly jailing protesters also holds unknown infection control risks, given the heavy presence of the virus in jails and prisons.</p> \n<p>Nina Fefferman is a professor at the University of Tennessee Knoxville, and a mathematical epidemiologist. At the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, her work focused on projecting the impact of mass incarceration on the spread of the virus. Because communities of color are disproportionately jailed, they were also most likely to be affected by outbreaks in jails and prisons.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Protesters sent to jail for short periods in the current unrest are \u201ctemporarily increasing the number and also social diversity caught up in the criminal justice system, introducing them into a jail population, and then releasing them,\u201d said Fefferman. \u201cNone of it is good \u2013 but all of it is unusual.\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Four days of protest in Las Vegas provides an example of how this plays out on-the-ground. A local court ordinance asked police to release people charged with misdemeanors, rather than bring them into jail, to slow the spread of Covid-19. Instead, police working protests in Las Vegas have arrested at least 338 people over the course of the demonstrations, and have used teargas and pepper balls to disperse crowds.</p> \n<p>Fefferman developed a model used by the <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/smart-justice/new-model-shows-reducing-jail-population-will-lower-covid-19-death-toll-for-all-of-us/\">American Civil Liberties Union</a> that found reducing mass incarceration could save 100,000 lives \u2013 including 76,000 lives among the broader community \u2013 because it would reduce the rate of infected corrections officers and accused who return to the community after exposure to the coronavirus.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>At the same time, Covid-19 has already taken a devastating and disproportionate toll on black Americans, because of a laundry list of state policies. Black Americans are less likely to have <a href=\"https://www.nationalpartnership.org/our-work/resources/economic-justice/paid-sick-days/african-american-workers-need-paid-sick-days.pdf\">paid sick leave</a>, less likely to live in states with <a href=\"https://www.medicaid.gov/about-us/program-history/medicaid-50th-anniversary/entry/47671\">public health insurance safety nets</a> and<strong> </strong>are overrepresented among <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/business/economy/black-workers-inequality-economic-risks.html\">essential workers</a>,&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cAfrican Americans already suffer from chronic under-treated and untreated illness within our healthcare system, that denies them care at every level,\u201d Boyd said. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"69591434-e851-4bb8-aa30-0a6f773b6f97\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sjhF1GI9n8A?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Researchers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have argued, as recently as 2017, that anti-discrimination laws in employment, housing, education and healthcare result in enormous gains in life expectancy for Americans of color \u2013 when they are enforced.&nbsp;That provides powerful reasons to keep protesting for police reform, even in the face of a pandemic.</p> \n<p>Demonstrations that led to civil rights in the American south provide one salient example of the health benefits of fighting for minority rights. In the 1960s, the American south segregated hospitals. However, they were forced to integrate after a court ruled white segregationists could not deny treatment to black Americans.</p> \n<p>Researchers found over six years from the time of the change, that the rate of black infants dying from pneumonia and diarrhea <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5730086/\">dropped by 40%</a> while the rate of infant death among whites remained the same. Researchers now estimate between 1965 and 2002, the change saved 38,600 black lives.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Protests of the past, which \u201ccame on the backs of black bodies that were murdered in the streets\u201d, have secured protections Boyd said, \u201cnot just for black people \u2013 for women,&nbsp;for LGBTQ folks, for everybody in this country who ever needed a civil liberty\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>The early months of Donald Trump\u2019s administration saw its approach to science routinely compared to George W Bush\u2019s \u2013 both governments were highly sympathetic to large corporations, distrustful of anything to do with the climate crisis and enthused at the idea of delegating oversight to the states.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s version may have been more abrasive and bungling but it at least seemed a familiar extension of the last Republican administration.</p> <p>More recently, however, scientists have been struck by Trump\u2019s embrace of fringe beliefs and extreme, unsupported theories. Suddenly, it is not the profit-driven lobbyists and lawyers that are the worry, it is the quacks, cranks and conspiracy theorists.</p> <p>\u201cThey have exceeded my imagination with their scientific denial,\u201d said Gretchen Goldman, a research director at Union of Concerned Scientists. \u201cPrevious administrations at least gave the appearance of wanting scientific evidence and qualified people in positions of power. This administration clearly doesn\u2019t care, which changes the game.\u201d</p> <p>Trump himself has a long history of defying mainstream scientific findings on the existence of climate change and the efficacy of vaccines, but his actions during the coronavirus pandemic have startled even his most vocal critics.</p> <p>The president falsely claimed Covid-19 would evaporate in the April sunshine, expressed bewilderment that a vaccine wasn\u2019t imminent and pondered the merits of injecting disinfectant as a treatment. Trump has also repeatedly touted the benefits of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug he says he himself has taken as a precaution despite evidence it can cause heart problems in some patients. The World Health Organization recently <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/health-52799120\">halted</a> trials to see if the drug could treat Covid-19, citing safety fears.</p> <p>From its inception, the Trump administration has handed leadership of federal agencies to figures who have represented polluting industries. Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist, heads the Environmental Protection Agency, while David Bernhardt, another former energy lobbyist, is in charge of America\u2019s public lands as secretary of the interior.</p> <p>The deregulatory zeal of these agencies, often in the face of scientific advice, has seen droves of scientists leave the government. In a January estimate, 20% of high-level scientific positions within the government are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/science-ranks-grow-thin-in-trump-administration/2020/01/23/5d22b522-3172-11ea-a053-dc6d944ba776_story.html\">vacant</a>, with long-term officials complaining of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/17/whistleblowers-scientists-climate-crisis-trump-administration\">being sidelined or silenced</a>.</p> <p>But the administration has also increasingly shown willingness to ally itself with groups far more fringe than the standard class of lobbyist that inhabits Washington DC.</p> <p>The administration defended Trump\u2019s use of hydroxychloroquine by pointing to supportive statements from the Association of Physicians and Surgeons, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/24/hydroxychloroquine-trump-us-doctors-coronavirus\">an outlier group</a> that has questioned whether HIV causes Aids (it does), argued abortion causes breast cancer (it does not) and even alleged former president Barack Obama used hypnosis techniques to trick voters, especially Jewish people, into supporting him (there is no evidence of this).</p> <p>In April, Trump unveiled advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that Americans should wear face masks to curb the spread of Covid-19, but has since echoed fringe rightwing views that masks are pointless or somehow unmanly. The president said on Tuesday it was \u201cvery unusual\u201d that Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, was seen wearing a mask, calling its use \u201cpolitically correct\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe elevation of fringe views is even more vivid with coronavirus, the impacts are more evident,\u201d said Goldman.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Trump administration has aligned itself with an anti-abortion lobbying group called the Center for Family and Human Rights, helping spread its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/may/16/cfam-rightwing-white-house-anti-abortion-un\">message to the UN</a>, while Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/27/paula-white-donald-trump-pastor-evangelicals\">own spiritual advis</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/27/paula-white-donald-trump-pastor-evangelicals\">er Paula White</a> has said she hopes abortion laws are overturned, declaring on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/27/satanic-pregnancies-trump-spiritual-adviser-paula-white-outlandish-acts\">video</a> that emerged in January: \u201cWe command any satanic pregnancies to miscarry right now!\u201d</p> <p>The pandemic has obscured a determined push by the Trump administration to further roll back regulations designed to prevent pollution and protect public health, with some of these efforts jarring uncomfortably with the federal government\u2019s own analysis.</p> <p>For example, the administration is scaling back fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks, a process that has provoked a <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press-docs/5.27.20%20Petition%20for%20Review.pdf\">lawsuit</a> from 23 aggrieved states and, according to <a href=\"https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/Cars_Final_Rollback_Factsheet.pdf\">a study of the EPA\u2019s own figures</a>, will cause an extra 18,500 deaths over the next three decades from air pollution, as well as $240bn more in extra fuel costs for Americans.</p> <p>\u201cThis administration is antithetical to science, there is an ideological mandate to roll back regulations. Facts and logic doesn\u2019t matter, even the law doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Chris Frey, a a professor of environmental engineering at NC State University.</p> <p>Frey was part of an EPA clean air advisory panel that was dismantled as part of a revamp that has seen agency panels filled with industry-aligned and fringe characters \u2013 including an official who <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/14/583972957/top-epa-science-adviser-has-history-of-questioning-pollution-research\">has argued air pollution is good for public health</a> \u2013 and the process of considering science rerouted to bypass a large body of research that links pollution to harm such as asthma and heart disease.</p> <p>\u201cIt will take years to undo the damage. This administration is honestly a threat to public health,\u201d Frey said. \u201cThe past three years have hurt the US scientific community in a lot of ways. If this continues for another three years, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s robust enough to take it.\u201d</p> <p>US politics\u2019 problematic relationship with science doesn\u2019t just hinge upon one administration, however. Until the election of a handful of people with scientific backgrounds in the 2018 midterms, Bill Foster was the only member of Congress with a scientific PhD. Foster has admitted the experience often felt lonely and frustrating.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve achieved a lot with science but I\u2019m embedded in a culture that doesn\u2019t value science,\u201d said Foster, an Illinois Democrat. \u201cThe heroes we are looking for are the people who have spent their careers in science.\u201d</p> <p>Foster added that Trump\u2019s reaction to mask wearing has cost lives.</p> <p>\u201cIf he had said masks are very useful and then apologized for the fact the stockpile of masks was so low, many tens of thousands of Americans would be alive today,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the tragedy that bothers me more than anything.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>No one accuses Donald Trump of subtlety.

She comes from Pentecostal background, and she started speaking in tongues. I haven\u2019t heard her speak in tongues in years,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought, look at my president! He\u2019s establishing the Lord\u2019s kingdom in the world.\u201d</p> \n<p>Did he feel that conflicted with the Gospel of John, where Jesus said \u201cmy kingdom is not of this world\u201d?</p> \n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Horbowy said, \u201cthat\u2019s a philosophical question.\u201d</p> \n<p>After watching Trump\u2019s gesture, Horbowy changed his Facebook profile photo to one of Trump outside St John\u2019s, with added rays of light emanating from the Bible. \u201cIt was the coolest thing he could do. What more could he do, wear blue jeans and ride in on a horse?\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The catalyst for the protests was the killing of 46-year-old George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Asked about that, Horbowy said, \u201cThere\u2019s a Bible verse that says we shouldn\u2019t talk about evil things.

  "<p>Sport is meant to provide us with competition, but more importantly it is meant to provide us with emotion. To make us feel things.

The punch from nowhere that knocks over the champion is like nothing else. It makes the pulse race and the heart beat fast. And it lives with you, as I can testify to having been at the Manchester Arena in November 2013 as George Groves squared up to Carl Froch and delivered a display brimming with shock and awe.</p> <p>It was a wild night and for Groves an ultimately devastating one given the 25-year-old was denied a first world title via a controversial ninth-round stoppage.

Certainly these women are not violent.\u201d</p> <h2>Battling cancer and Covid inside</h2> <p>One of the women on Ma\u2019s list is Patricia Wright. \u201cI\u2019m frail and I\u2019m just so afraid to die here,\u201d Wright, 68, said in a recent phone call from the California Institution for Women (CIW), east of Los Angeles, where 159 inmates have contracted coronavirus. She has terminal liver cancer, is currently in chemotherapy and probably has months to live: \u201cI suffer from loneliness. It\u2019s harder than cancer.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Audio clip of Patricia Wright\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;audio controls&gt; &lt;source src=&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/archive-5-zip/giv-3902AwSj6ffJQYES/PATRICIA.wav&quot; type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><em><strong>It\u2019s heart-wrenching being away from my children and grandchildren.

She is legally blind and uses a wheelchair. She was convicted of murder, accused of hiring someone to kill her abusive husband. Wright has always maintained her innocence. \u201cI\u2019m no threat to society,\u201d said Wright. \u201cI\u2019ve listened to Governor Gavin Newsom speak. I know if he knew my condition, he would listen to me.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Maria Aredondo, 67, has stage II breast cancer, and is held in the same prison as Wright. As CIW has locked down in an attempt to contain Covid, it\u2019s been even harder for her to get basic medical attention, her family said. Aredondo was convicted of murder after her gun was used in a robbery attempt that turned fatal.&nbsp;According to her lawyers, she was moved to a dirty cell after returning from chemotherapy last month. No one checked on her, said her daughter, Maria Nu\u00f1ez. \u201cEvery time we hear from her she says her health is deteriorating,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez added.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4809613065af78a4350864288281984110192cb5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4809613065af78a4350864288281984110192cb5/0_167_1242_745/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maria Aredondo has stage two breast cancer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maria Aredondo has stage two breast cancer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maria Aredondo, courtesy of family</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Terri Hardy, a prison spokeswoman, said&nbsp;CIW had moved women \u201cto allow for more social distancing\u201d, and that cells are cleaned before transfers. Women placed in isolation or quarantine due to Covid have access to \u201cdaily medical rounds\u201d, she added.</p> <p>Some other severely immunocompromised women who remain incarcerated in jails with Covid outbreaks are serving time for more minor allegations. Carole Dunham, 29, was convicted of a drug charge and was jailed after she failed to complete all the hours of her community service. She has two children, for whom she became the only parent after her husband was murdered.</p> <p>Dunham has type-one diabetes and said she recently collapsed inside an LA county jail because her blood sugar was so low. As Covid spread among the women around her, she said their treatment by staff had worsened, and she struggles to get the basic nutrition she requires. Sometimes they give her rotten food, she said in a phone call.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cOur rights are being violated here,\u201d Dunham said. \u201cWhat happens if my kids will be left without a mother and a father? I think about it all the time.\u201d LA sheriff\u2019s office, which runs this jail, did not respond to inquiries.</p> <h2>Thousands of jailed survivors: \u2018We need healing\u2019&nbsp;</h2> <p>Newsom has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/how-the-coronavirus-crisis-gave-gavin-newsom-his-leadership-moment\">earned some national praise</a> for his handling of Covid-19, instituting early lockdowns and avoiding the level of crisis that has hit New York. But civil rights activists say his inaction on prisons could define his coronavirus legacy.&nbsp;</p> <p>He has granted 44 commutations since he became governor last year, including 21 last month, though his office said the move was not related to Covid, and many are still waiting to be released or have parole hearings. Advocates with a number of <a href=\"https://survivedandpunished.org/\">community groups</a> say there are at least 150 active applications on his desk from women who are survivors of domestic violence.&nbsp;</p> <p>Newsom\u2019s office did not respond to questions about Ma\u2019s letter and declined to comment on the women\u2019s individual cases. A spokeswoman said, \u201cEach and every clemency application is reviewed on its own merits, and receives the careful and individualized consideration by the governor.\u201d</p> <p>Shajia Ayobi, 54, has been incarcerated for the past eight years and is held at CIW. She has developed diabetes and recently suffered from kidney and bladder infections.</p> <p>Ayobi was born in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, and says she still has nightly flashbacks after witnessing rocket attacks and the murder of her neighbors during her childhood.</p> <p>Ayobi fled the Soviet-Afghan war, but the violence followed her. She raised four children in Sacramento, California, and endured constant physical and psychological abuse from her husband, who suffered from complex PTSD from his time in the army, she wrote in one letter from prison. Her young children, she said, became accustomed to hiding kitchen knives from their father, who also threatened her with a gun.</p> <p>By December 2011, \u201cI believed 100% with all my heart and my bones in my body that my husband was about to commit a murder-suicide and kill all the kids, my poor kids,\u201d she said by phone. A friend who was trying to help her escape the abuse ended up killing her husband. A jury later determined that although Ayobi did not pull the trigger, she was guilty of plotting the murder and sentenced to life.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThere are millions of women like me,\u201d she said. \u201cThe separation from my kids, this is the harshest punishment I have received.

One US government <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/ovw/page/file/926631/download\">report</a> estimated that between 77% and 90% of incarcerated women have extensive histories of emotional, physical and sexual abuse.</p> <p>\u201cBeing a victim and survivor of domestic violence means that you need an intervention. You need help, you need healing,\u201d said Tomiekia Johnson, 41, in a call&nbsp;last month from the Central California Women\u2019s Facility (CCWF) near Fresno. \u201cSending them to prison, to places where anti-rehabilitation is the model, realistically it makes people worse.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>In 2012, Johnson, then a highway patrol officer and Compton resident, was convicted of murdering her husband, and sentenced to life.

One of the helicopters had Red Cross markings and the show of force is being investigated by the national guard, according to the Washington Post. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T03:30:37.346Z\">at 4.30am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed703518f08f5e373013753\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T02:04:20.190Z\">3.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Thousands of protesters have rallied peacefully outside of the White House</strong> on Tuesday evening, chanting \u201ckeep the peace\u201d as night grew dark. </p> \n  <p>The crowd grew thinner after 8pm, an hour after the capital\u2019s curfew had set in, but several hundred remained outside of the fence. </p> \n  <p>When one protester climbed a lamp post and removed a street sign he was roundly booed by others. \u201cIt\u2019s not what we\u2019re about,\u201d George \u201cTJ\u201d Pierce, one of the protesters in the park, told the Associated Press.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab535496fb54b2db3763d6efa0d0fbb221c401d9\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab535496fb54b2db3763d6efa0d0fbb221c401d9/0_110_3320_1993/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators gather in front of a fence surrounding Lafayette Park outside the White House on Tuesday evening\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators gather in front of a fence surrounding Lafayette Park outside the White House on Tuesday evening.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24a451d17b688d05c6f6926bad79bef907171e6e\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24a451d17b688d05c6f6926bad79bef907171e6e/0_0_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators near Lafayette park on Tuesday evening\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators near Lafayette park on Tuesday evening.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivier Douliery/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fec67f5d1bd1c4954a288b69cda504f04bc76eda\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fec67f5d1bd1c4954a288b69cda504f04bc76eda/0_113_3396_2038/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hundreds of demonstrators marching toward Lafayette Park and the White House\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hundreds of demonstrators marching toward Lafayette Park and the White House.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T02:32:53.966Z\">at 3.32am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed6ff4d8f084df971c8ea0e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/julianborger\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T01:53:24.973Z\">2.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Analysis: Trump has normalised mayhem and the US is paying the price</strong></p> \n  <p>The sheer tumult of the Trump era, the unceasing torrent of events that were unthinkable even hours before, has left a nation constantly off balance, unable to find its bearing and grasp how far it has traveled.</p> \n  <p>The developments of the past 24 hours were a reminder of how slippery the downward slope has been. </p> \n  <p>More than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/100000-dead-in-the-us\">a hundred thousand Americans are dead from a pandemic</a> after the government\u2019s botched response; there are armoured cars and troops outside Washington metro stations; men in combat gear carrying sniper rifles were seen perched in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Charles_Lister/status/1267815222619799552\">open door of a helicopter</a> flying low over the commercial district.

A century later, it\u2019s still failing</strong></p> \n  <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/carol-anderson\">Carol Anderson</a>, the Charles Howard Candler professor of African American Studies at Emory University and the author of White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide, writes for The Guardian: </em></p> \n  <p>In 1919, as soldiers returned from the first world war, many white Americans saw African American men in military uniforms for the first time. That sight, and the challenge it posed to the political, social and economic order, was deeply threatening to them. Groups of armed white men hunted down and slaughtered hundreds of black Americans across the country. The wave of lynchings and race riots came to be known as the <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Red_Summer.html?id=2ogt4871j3sC\">Red Summer</a>.</p> \n  <p>The black community did its best to fight back, without protection from the state. In some cases, police actively participated in the lynchings. The US attorney general, A Mitchell Palmer, claimed that leftwing radicals were behind the uprisings \u2013 a false charge and one that further endangered African American lives. Palmer worked for President Woodrow Wilson, an ardent segregationist who screened Birth of a Nation in the White House and <a href=\"https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/hatred-endorsed-president\">praised</a> the Ku Klux Klan even as it deployed terrorism to keep blacks away from the voting booth. Wilson <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/42977761,%20pages%20691-692\">had been silent</a> while whites slaughtered African Americans in <a href=\"https://www.riverfronttimes.com/newsblog/2017/06/28/first-hand-accounts-show-the-horror-of-east-louis-1917-race-riot\">East St Louis</a> in 1917, and he did little to nothing in 1919 when they again attacked and killed black people, this time on an even more horrific and grisly scale.</p> \n  <p>When African Americans fought back, when they protested, when they made clear they would not quietly accept the destruction of their lives, Palmer mobilized the power of the federal government to brand black unrest as the work of the enemy of the state \u2013 communists. It was his version of peace without justice. To do this he ignored the destructive and violent white supremacy that his president had helped unleash. He remained unconcerned about the bold, brazen killing of black people. And he had no qualms about a criminal justice system in which being black meant the presumption of guilt.<br></p> \n  <p>More than 100 years later, in the wake of the brutal, merciless killings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor \u2013 not to mention an incident in which a white woman attempted to put a black birdwatcher in the crosshairs of the NYPD \u2013 our current attorney general, Bill Barr, does not appear to see injustice.

It is the Small Vessels Pool Department at the Admiralty. If that organisation had not been at work before the recent emergency arose there is no knowing how the rapid assembly of the 687 small craft which brought the men away from Northern France would have been arranged.</p> <p>The department was started some months ago to co-ordinate the use by the Navy of all the small motor craft and yachts which were placed at the disposal of the country for the duration. One \u00a3250,000 yacht, for example, was lured to the Navy for one shilling a month, and many similar instances could be cited. So when the urgent need arose for small craft to help off the northern coast of France the machinery was ready to cope with it.</p> <p><strong>Eager volunteers \u201cfor dangerous work\u201d<br></strong>Nor was it only a question of ships. Men, too, were needed, and the officials of the Pool recount with pride many cases of prompt volunteering. One that seems to me to show the spirit of the country better than any other occurred at a labour exchange. The authorities sent through to say that they wanted a few men for a few days for dangerous work. The labour exchange kept open until nine o\u2019clock at night and then reported that they had 150 volunteers ready to join, not knowing what the work was or what the danger was but willing to go anywhere and do anything.</p> <p>Again, two men with small knowledge of navigation and less of engines were asked if they could take across a motor-boat with a rather complex engine-room. Their reply was, \u201cIf someone will start the engines up on this side we\u2019ll see that they don\u2019t stop until we get back again with our quota of men.\u201d<br><em>(<a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2020/05/29/bef.jpg\">Continue reading</a>).</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ec02ea25941f048ac103beed720c73ed7c20b20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ec02ea25941f048ac103beed720c73ed7c20b20/0_119_2170_1302/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Operation Dynamo, Dunkirk, 4 June 1940.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Operation Dynamo, Dunkirk, 4 June 1940.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The embarkation at Dunkirk: Naval officer\u2019s story</h2> <p>From our naval correspondent<br>8 June 1940</p> <p>A naval officer who took part in the embarkation arrangements on the stone pier at Dunkirk gave me to-day a series of personal impressions of the work and the way it was done.</p> <p>A party of ten naval officers and 150 seamen were sent over to organise the withdrawal through the harbour.

The harbour was being bombed almost continuously, some of the attacks being particularly heavy, and when the bombers turned their attention specially to the ships moving in and out the position became worse. After about two days also the enemy got heavy guns within range and was able to keep the shoreward end of the pier, where the movement of the troops was organised, under fairly constant fire, but their shooting was not good and did actually little to interfere with our operations.</p> <p><strong>One hour\u2019s sleep in twenty-four</strong><br>There were at times as many as 25,000 troops assembled for the chance to embark and rarely fewer than 10,000.

The town\u2019s water supply had been broken down by one of the first air raids. By the third day the air bombing was so heavy and the damage to warships moving in and out of the harbour so obvious that the senior naval officer had to decide, much against his wish, that embarkation could only take Place at night.<br><em>(<a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2020/05/29/Embark_8_June_1940.jpg\">Continue reading</a>)</em></p> <h2><a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2020/05/29/10_june.jpg\">How the Dunkirk evacuation was organised: handling the \u201chorde of little boats\u201d</a></h2> <p>10 June 1940</p> <p>A small band of junior officers, working in a secret control room known as the \u201cdynamo room\u201d at a naval base on the south-east coast of England, helped to direct the evacuation which saved more than 335,000 officers and men of the Allied forces beleaguered in Flanders.

Not only was this a facile attempt at armchair activism, it actively disrupted the hashtag #blacklivesmatter,&nbsp;which protesters, reporters and activists were using to collate news about police violence against protesters. At exactly the moment when power requires interrogation and urgent reckoning, social media users, celebrities and influencers rallied for silence.</p> <p>No matter the occasion, social media can always be relied upon to gaze deep into its collective navel. Whereas 24 hours earlier, users had been posting legal information, names of pro bono lawyers and bail funds, filming videos of wanton cruelty and abuses of power, now they were <em>shtum</em>, save for the sanctimonious black squares.&nbsp;</p> <p>Thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic, many&nbsp;people&nbsp;cannot join protests, due to lockdowns or worries over infecting elderly friends and relatives. It\u2019s understandable that there would be calls for online demonstrations of solidarity with our black brothers and sisters fighting for their lives, but&nbsp;the music industry might have chosen a&nbsp;less useless&nbsp;approach.</p> <p>Instagram users, for example,&nbsp;could have been spurred to mass-post pages from a 2006 FBI internal intelligence memo \u2013 heavily redacted \u2013 that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/01/31/the-fbi-has-quietly-investigated-white-supremacist-infiltration-of-law-enforcement/\">detailed the orchestrated infiltration</a>&nbsp;of police and law enforcement agencies by white supremacists. The memo noted white supremacists\u2019 \u201chistorical\u201d interest in law enforcement infiltration and warned that not only was there an \u201cactive presence\u201d of white supremacists in police departments across the country but that many operated as \u201cghost skins\u201d \u2013 neo-Nazis hiding their affiliations in order to \u201cblend into society and covertly advance white supremacist causes\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Social media\u00a0dents our critical perception and lulls us into, at best, the shallows of political engagement</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Or social media users might have chosen instead to make viral (a parlance we will hopefully shake&nbsp;after this&nbsp;pandemic) the fact that the Trump White House cancelled grants previously given to programs dedicated to reforming neo-Nazis and dissuading confused white youth from joining radical hate groups, such as Life After Hate. Or the fact that the Department of Homeland Security \u2013 whose very job is to identify internal dangers and threats \u2013 has shifted away from countering white far-right groups and terrorists since the Trump administration came to power.</p> <p>For all its distractions and entertainments, the inanity of #blackouttuesday has served as a vital reminder that social media is not a force for change. Instagram and Facebook, in particular, are echo chambers that consistently funnel our energy, righteous rage and political passions into inaction \u2013 into bland hashtags and likes.&nbsp;Social media&nbsp;dents our critical perception and lulls us into, at best, the shallows of political engagement\u2013 and I say this as a longtime user of social media.&nbsp;</p> <p>Not so long ago, #JeSuisCharlie became a rallying cry for social media warriors in the wake of the attack on Charlie Hebdo, a French satirical magazine. One can mourn the loss of life in a terrorist attack without identifying oneself with a magazine known for its racist depictions of Muslims, Jews and black people. But social media is not a place for nuance and less so for accountability. In this same way, Bollywood actors who have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thequint.com/entertainment/celebrities/priyanka-chopra-disha-patanicalled-out-for-endorsing-fairness-cream-and-condemning-racism\">shilled for skin-lightening&nbsp;products</a>&nbsp;\u2013 such as Priyanka Chopra, who advertised a cream called \u201cLight Ultra\u201d \u2013 can feel comfortable taking to their pages to bemoan racism. Gal Gadot, the actor who served in the Israel Defense Forces, can hashtag for George Floyd and earn&nbsp;hundreds of thousands of&nbsp;likes.</p> <p>Social media&nbsp;has long been a silo of hypocrisy, but its thoughtlessness in the face of raging inequality, violence and fear grows with each new crisis.

On Kangaroo Island that included providing reverse osmosis machines to create drinking water for livestock and to fly in 65,000 litres of drinking water for humans. </p> \n  <p>Johnson said it was the first time the ADF has been called out to assist with bushfire recovery.

He said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are looking at a discrete small number of awards in the industries where there has been the greatest damage wrought by Covid-19 and the necessary health responses. So the point that I make is that the hospitality award is a very complicated award. And when you listen to employers and employees who work in the system, they will note the demarcation between tasks \u2013 the 61 different pay-points and 14 different permutations creates regulatory barriers to the hiring and preservation of employees. So we are looking at ways that you can potentially simplify awards in a very narrow range of what are at the moment very distressed industries.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Porter reiterated that Morrison had been clear the ensuring integrity bill will not be put for a vote in the Senate, but still took a swipe at the construction union:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I would hope that in a time where Australia is facing the greatest economic challenge outside of a world war that it has ever faced, that people on construction sites who have been behaving in an unlawful way dial it the hell down.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T07:28:33.467Z\">at 8.28am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed747038f084df971c8eb48\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T06:45:53.833Z\">7.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>AAP has an update on the stock market:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>The Australian share market has rallied to its highest level since 6 March, with gains across nearly every sector on a wave of optimism about Australia\u2019s economic prospects.</p> \n   <p>The S&amp;P/ASX200 benchmark index closed Wednesday close to the highs of the day, up 106.5 points, or 1.83%, at 5,941.6 points, while the All Ordinaries index gained 104.8 points, or 1.76%, at 6,064.9.</p> \n   <p>One Australian dollar was buying 69.36 US cents, up from 68.02 US cents at the close of trade on Tuesday.</p> \n   <p>The Aussie reached 69.84 US cents earlier on Wednesday, its highest point since early January. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T07:29:21.413Z\">at 8.29am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed73f298f087122eca548b2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T06:14:59.568Z\">7.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>On the ABC, Labor\u2019s treasury spokesman, <strong>Jim Chalmers</strong>, is asked by <strong>Patricia Karvelas</strong> what should happen to the jobseeker payment. </p> \n  <p>It is currently at about $1,100 a fortnight with the coronavirus supplement, but that will be halved from the end of September. </p> \n  <p>He says it shouldn\u2019t \u201csnap back\u201d to the old rate, but declines to give a figure, saying \u201cwe need to be really responsible with the budget.

was held to be legally insufficient doesn\u2019t mean that there weren\u2019t debts in existence,\u201d he said. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThat applies we argue to this class of plaintiffs at large and if you have a look at the individual plaintiffs on the Gordon Legal website, you know, it\u2019s been reported in the Guardian as well, people did actually owe debts.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Given this, and what Porter claimed was the \u201cenormous money overpaid to people\u201d over many years, he flagged the government had not lost hope of recouping the money. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThere are still debts and that\u2019s why we have to, notwithstanding this litigation and its ultimately conclusion, <strong>go back to the drawing board and work out ways to in a legally sufficient way</strong> calculate and recoup that debt because it can\u2019t be let going on as it is.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The Guardian reported yesterday the government has not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/02/coalition-wont-rule-out-passing-new-laws-to-reboot-robodebt-scheme\">ruled out legislating to allow a reboot of mass scale debt

  "<p>\u201cWhen I was hired the United States had never won a game in international competition. Five years later, we were world champions.

Beyond the US, though, he is virtually anonymous. Yet he is one of the most successful American coaches of any sport, in any time. At 69 Dorrance is still going, 43 years after he took charge of the UNC men\u2019s team and 41 after he helped to launch the women\u2019s. He coached both for 13 years before switching solely to the women\u2019s side, with whom he has won 22 division one titles. For context, the nearest to that record are Notre Dame and Stanford universities with three titles apiece. From 1986 he managed the US women\u2019s national team for eight years, including to their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2020/apr/20/remembering-usa-v-norway-in-the-first-women-world-cup-final-football-weekly-podcast\">first World Cup win in 1991</a>.</p> <p>Dorrance is the brainchild of the winning mentality that sets apart the US women\u2019s national team. He has fed players through his UNC programme into every US world-beating side since. April Heinrichs, Shannon Higgins, Kristine Lilly and Mia Hamm, each national college player of the year twice during their time at UNC, are four of 19 UNC players to have been given that honour. The former Arsenal midfielder Heather O\u2019Reilly, an assistant coach to Dorrance, and the former Chelsea full-back Crystal Dunn are two more recently similarly recognised while at UNC.</p> <p>Staggeringly, one-third of the players who have won the World Cup with the US have been coached by Dorrance. Five of the 2019 squad were in that category. Lucy Bronze attended Dorrance\u2019s summer camps in her early teens, prompting the coach to encourage England scouts to watch her, and she also spent a semester at Chapel Hill, winning a championship.

Well, we take intramural sports here very seriously. I\u2019ve got a list of the winter and spring sports here on this clipboard.

If you\u2019re the Japanese you\u2019re better than we are technically, if you are the Germans you\u2019re better than we are tactically, if you are the French you have just as many athletes as we have, so what is it in the American nature that still permits us to be dynastic in a sport that is not even \u2018our\u2019 sport?

Dorrance has a \u201c28-category competition\u201d and his players\u2019 rankings are posted on a public bulletin board. \u201cThey move up and down these competitive ladders based on performance,\u201d Dorrance explains.</p> <p>\u201cThe biggest challenge, honestly, when you go from coaching men to coaching women is that we raise our girls and young women to not be competitive. Society conditions them not to be. But what the heck is going on where if you\u2019re a competitive woman you\u2019re excoriated and if you\u2019re a competitive male you\u2019re basically put on a pedestal?.</p> <p>\u201cI had to correct that dynamic, but also protect the competitive women players and basically point to them and say: \u2018You know what?

For a start there\u2019s how the message was presented. Most organizations\u2019 statements posted on Twitter are starting to sound a little manufactured, like they all have the same ghostwriter. Perhaps Goodell should have called a (socially distanced) press conference and said something along these lines:</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have seen the errors of our ways in our handling of the Colin Kaepernick situation.

  "<p>Most of us who have followed Brexit closely believed coronavirus would soften the government\u2019s stance in trade talks with Europe. The economic shock triggered by the pandemic, and the fact Whitehall is so overwhelmed managing it, made it more likely the government would extend the transition period, due to expire at the end of this year, or strike a deal. It turns out that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/29/june-brexit-summit-on-cards-talks-heading-for-deadlock\">the opposite</a> is true. Rather than encouraging a more flexible and pragmatic approach, Covid-19 has instead reinforced the case for no deal at the very top of government.</p> <p>Perhaps the most important driver is the belief among ministers that the UK economy will be permanently reshaped by the crisis, as companies create new supply chains and reshore production to provide greater resilience in the future, not least in case of another pandemic. The government wants a free hand to facilitate this change, one that it believes would be constrained by the EU\u2019s demand that the UK remain tied to its labour and environmental standards and state aid rules.</p> <p>On the other side of the same coin, there are growing fears in cabinet that maintaining close EU ties would lock the UK into the EU\u2019s post-Covid-19 economic measures designed for its 27 member states, with little regard for the UK\u2019s interests.&nbsp;This is nonsense, as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/defining-moment-coronavirus-as-eu-executive-pushes-for-500bn-in-grants\">EU\u2019s rescue package unveiled last Wednesday</a> assumes no UK financial contribution. But it is a powerful argument on the Eurosceptic backbenches and has scared many in cabinet.</p> <p>Another&nbsp;argument popular with backbench Brexiteers, but now more prominent among ministers, is the belief that coronavirus presents the government with an opportunity to \u201cbury\u201d the&nbsp;loss of growth from no trade deal under the cover of the much more dramatic drop in GDP caused by coronavirus.</p> <p>The politics of this are very juicy for the Vote Leave team in the driving seat in government. Not least because it is only really a no deal that fully delivers on their substantive \u201cdivergence\u201d agenda, while any&nbsp;version of a deal with the EU, no matter how distant, will ultimately tie the UK into EU rules and regulations in some way, an idea they hate and are loth to accept.&nbsp;No deal also&nbsp;facilitates a trade deal with the US, and the symbolism of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/20/the-guardian-view-on-global-britain-a-lonely-fiction\">Global Britain</a>\u201d is key for ministers \u2013 far more important than the limited economic benefit a UK-US trade pact would bring.</p> <p>Time is also running out. Despite three rounds of talks so far, no progress has been made and negotiators on both sides are downbeat about the likelihood of a breakthrough this week.&nbsp;Big gaps remain \u2013 in the UK over whether and how far to align to EU standards, the role of the European court of justice and the EU\u2019s demands to fish in UK waters. But&nbsp;the government won\u2019t extend the transition period. Boris Johnson believes he would struggle to sell to voters the extra \u00a310bn in financial contributions and further spell of EU control of UK laws that this would bring.</p> <p>A political intervention on both sides will therefore be needed to move beyond the current stage. There will l be an opportunity this month, when Johnson meets the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, virtually, around the time of a long-planned EU leaders\u2019 session in June to review progress.&nbsp;But the EU is unlikely to change its mandate and absent progress, ministers plan to make a judgment in September so they can give business clarity about the trading arrangements from 1 January. They may switch to assuming and preparing for no deal then.</p> <p>Finally, the survival of Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s closest adviser, despite allegations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/28/durham-police-believe-cummings-probably-did-break-lockdown-rules\">he broke the lockdown rules</a>, also enhances the prospect of no deal. One reason why Brexiteer ministers and aides rallied behind him is that he sees it as his personal mission to prevent Johnson extending the transition period in June, and delivering a version of Brexit that lets the UK \u201ctake back control\u201d. It would be wrong to underestimate his impact on the outcome of these negotiations.</p> <p>Of course, this could all be tactics and bluster. Johnson&nbsp;and his cheerleaders on the backbenches have convinced themselves that such brinkmanship worked during the withdrawal agreement talks, so it is no real surprise they intend to repeat the trick now. Especially as they believe, wrongly, that coronavirus will make the EU more desperate to conclude a deal and buckle at the last moment. But Downing Street is right that December is the real deadline.</p> <p>Germany\u2019s role will be key. I say this not as a naive Brit, believing that Angela Merkel will ride to Britain\u2019s rescue, but as someone who has spent more than two decades studying and working on EU affairs. With Germany at the head of Europe\u2019s rotating presidency, and Merkel in the final throes of her chancellorship, she will find it very hard to sign off on no deal. Of all of the EU\u2019s member states, Germany has been the most focused on the longer-term, geopolitical risk of no deal, and the necessity for the UK and EU to maintain constructive ties.</p> <p>But even Merkel can\u2019t and won\u2019t save the UK from itself, and will not agree to a deal at any price.&nbsp;If the net effect of Covid-19 is that ministers see more benefit than cost from no deal, with the dominant view in cabinet now opposed to extending the transitional period, then that will indeed be the outcome at the end of this year.</p> <p>\u2022 Mujtaba Rahman is the managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group, a political risk research and consulting firm</p>",
  "<p>Boris Johnson has opened the path to what he called one of the \u201cbiggest changes\u201d to the British visa system, stating he was ready to offer a right to live and work in the UK to any of the nearly 3 million Hong Kong citizens eligible for a British National Overseas passport.</p> <p>Ministers have been ambivalent since last Thursday on whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/uk-will-extend-visas-for-300000-hong-kong-residents-says-raab\">the UK government\u2019s offer of an extendable 12-month visa </a>would be available only to the 350,000 current BNO passport holders in Hong Kong, or would also include the more than 2.5 million eligible to apply for the passport.</p> <p>In the Commons on Tuesday, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/raab-calls-for-alliance-to-force-china-to-step-back-over-hong-kong\">implied the offer was </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/raab-calls-for-alliance-to-force-china-to-step-back-over-hong-kong\"> available only to the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/raab-calls-for-alliance-to-force-china-to-step-back-over-hong-kong\">narrower group</a>, stressing the government needed to be realistic about what it could offer. However, writing in the Times on Wednesday,, Johnson appeared to make a far wider offer to all those eligible to hold a BNO passport.</p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s offer would come into play only if China presses ahead with new security laws that strip Hong Kong of its traditional freedoms.</p> <p>Johnson wrote in the Times that if the security laws were pursued, \u201cBritain would have no choice but to uphold our profound ties of history and friendship with the people of Hong Kong\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cToday about 350,000 people hold British Nationals (Overseas) passports and another 2.5 million people would be eligible to apply for them. At present these passports allow for visa free access for up to six months.</p> <p>\u201cIf China imposes its national security law, the British government will change its immigration rules and allow any holder of these passports from Hong Kong to come to the UK for a renewable period of 12 months and be given further immigration rights including the right to work which would place them on the route to citizenship.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThis would amount to one of the biggest changes to our visa system in history. If it proves necessary Britain will take this step and take it willingly.\u201d</p> <p>In the Commons, Raab seemed more circumspect, saying: \u201cWe have said that we will allow the 300,000-plus passport holders, along with their dependants, to come to the UK in the way I described.\u201d</p> <p>It is not known how many of these eligible for a BNO passport would apply, but Raab said in the event of a mass exodus he would hope the burden would be shared internationally.</p> <p>The ambiguity in the UK government position about the precise extent of its offer to Hong Kong citizens, and the pathway to citizenship, may reflect differences within the cabinet.&nbsp;It could also reflect a British desire to leave China guessing about the potential scale of a British-enabled brain drain from Hong Kong, if Beijing seeks to suppress human rights in the territory.</p> <p>Johnson also used his article to make a final appeal to China to reconsider its actions, urging the leaders in Beijing to realise that with power came the need for magnanimity.</p> <p>He wrote: \u201cBritain does not seek to prevent China\u2019s rise; on the contrary we will work side by side on all the issues where our interests converge, from trade to climate change. We want a modern and mature relationship, based on mutual respect and recognising China\u2019s place in the world.</p> <p>\u201cAnd it is precisely because we welcome China as a leading member of the world community that we expect it to abide by international agreements.\u201d</p> <p>Martin Lee, a barrister, former legislator and co-drafter of the basic law, said the offers by foreign governments to help people from Hong Kong people were generous, but not enough.</p> <p>\u201cBecause no matter how generous you are in the provision of passports and so on, there are still large numbers of people who are not eligible for one reason or another,\u201d Lee told the Guardian.</p> <p>This included young people who protested over the past year, more than 8,000 of whom were arrested and feared further charges under the national security laws.</p> <p>\u201cSo I want more, and I want the international community to put their heads together and come up with a multinational sustainable solution for Hong Kong.\u201d</p> <p>He said Beijing had clearly breached its treaty obligations. The then Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping had made great efforts in 1997 to have the declaration supported by the international community and registered in the United Nations, Lee said, precisely to ensure Hong Kong\u2019s elite residents and businesses did not flee. \u201cWhen I say I want them to do more I mean hold China to the original policy.\u201d </p> <p>Johnson\u2019s article was welcomed as a \u201cremarkable intervention\u201d by Johnny Patterson, director of the human rights NGO Hong Kong Watch. He said: \u201cIt is a watershed moment in Sino-British relations.&nbsp;No sitting PM has made a statement as bold as this on Hong Kong since the handover.</p> <p>\u201cIt reflects two things, first the severity of the situation on the ground, and second the fact that the British government genuinely, and rightly, feel a sense of duty to citizens of Hong Kong and are going to do all they can to stop them becoming the collateral&nbsp;damage of escalating geopolitical tensions.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Authorities in Beijing are drafting legislation to outlaw criticism of traditional medicine in the Chinese capital.</p> <p>A notice published by health authorities called for public submissions on the draft, which would ban any individual or organisation from making false or exaggerated claims about traditional Chinese medicine, or using it for illegitimate interests or to damage public interest.</p> <p>It would potentially lead to the criminal prosecution of people who criticise traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) or \u201ccause trouble or disturb public order\u201d by breaching the law.</p> <p>The move comes amid a broader campaign by China to promote TCM at home and abroad.

Five years of unassailable power for Johnson\u2019s Conservatives, even as popular support collapses, would have been impossible.</p> <p>The structure and symbolism of parliament, with its preposterous rituals and incomprehensible procedures, could scarcely be better designed to alienate people, or to favour former public schoolboys, educated in a similar environment.

The portcullis is topped by a crown, reminding us that power is still vested symbolically in an unelected head of state. Many of her actual powers have been assumed, in the absence of a codified constitution, by the prime minister.</p> <p>These powers are routinely abused, by all governments. Prime ministers bypass parliament, governing through special advisers like Dominic Cummings. When they make catastrophic mistakes, they have the power to decide whether or not there should be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/06/coronavirus-inquiry-uk-evidence\">public inquiry</a>, and, if there should, what its terms and who its chair should be.

  "<h2>Top story: Work visa and \u2018route to citizenship\u2019</h2> \n<p>Hello, Warren Murray with you, well on our way through the week.</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson has opened the path to UK work and residency visas for stricken Hong Kong people if China goes ahead and imposes a national security edict on the territory. About 350,000 Hongkongers already hold \u201cBritish National Overseas\u201d passports and more than 2.5 million are believed eligible to apply. Johnson wrote in the Times that if new security laws were pursued by Beijing, \u201cBritain would have no choice but to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/britain-could-change-immigration-rules-for-hong-kong-citizens\">uphold our profound ties of history and friendship</a> with the people of Hong Kong\u201d.</p> \n<p>The prime minister wrote: \u201cIf China imposes its national security law, the British government will change its immigration rules and allow any holder of these passports from Hong Kong to come to the UK for a renewable period of 12 months and be given further immigration rights including the right to work which would place them on the route to citizenship \u2026&nbsp;This would amount to one of the biggest changes to our visa system in history.\u201d Johnson may face cabinet resistance to the idea but it was welcomed by the human rights NGO Hong Kong Watch. Johnny Patterson, its director, said: \u201cNo sitting PM has made a statement as bold as this on Hong Kong since the handover. It reflects first the severity of the situation on the ground, and second the fact that the British government genuinely, and rightly, feel a sense of duty to citizens of Hong Kong.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Coronavirus latest \u2013&nbsp;</strong>Keir Starmer has accused Boris Johnson of causing a collapse in public confidence over the government\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 crisis.

On the Cummings furore, Starmer said: \u201cIt\u2019s blindingly obvious to me that the prime minister is just too weak to sack [him].\u201d</p> \n<p>Starmer\u2019s intervention came as Prof Neil Ferguson, the leading epidemiologist who formerly advised the government, warned that&nbsp;if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/covid-19-spilling-out-of-hospitals-and-care-homes-says-uk-expert\">coronavirus infections in hospitals and care homes keep spilling into the community</a>&nbsp;they will sustain the outbreak for months; while an inquiry confirmed that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/covid-19-death-rate-in-england-higher-among-bame-people\">people of black and Asian origin are disproportionately affected by coronavirus</a>; the head of UK Statistics&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/statistics-watchdog-ministers-still-misleading-public-on-coronavirus-tests\">accused the government&nbsp;of continuing to mislead the public</a>&nbsp;over the number of tests carried out; and it emerged that England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, was responsible for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/02/chris-whitty-vetoed-lowering-of-coronavirus-alert-level\">vetoing the government\u2019s wish for England\u2019s official coronavirus alert level to be reduced</a>.</p> \n<p>Nearly 10 years of progress in narrowing the attainment gap in England between disadvantaged pupils and their classmates has probably been wiped out in a few months due to the pandemic, a study by the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF)&nbsp;has found.

  "<p>Shortly before midnight on 8 November 2016, Hillary Rodham Clinton dozed off in the bedroom of her Manhattan hotel. The presidential candidate was exhausted from the rigours of a bruising election campaign and rattled by a flurry of early results that suggested the verdict was far from a foregone conclusion. She closed her eyes as the slight favourite to become the US\u2019s first female president. She opened them to a nightmare and a world turned upside down.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s shock loss to Donald Trump \u2013 the embodiment of chaos to her bastion of control \u2013 left so much destruction in its wake (a victory party mothballed, shell-shocked staffers out of work, 66m futile votes) that it was easy to overlook the small matter of 2,000 hours of behind-the-scenes campaign footage, shot in a spirit of cautious optimism but now left to languish. Clinton\u2019s office suggested cobbling it together as an official record, an insider\u2019s account of what went wrong. But&nbsp;film-maker Nanette Burstein recoiled when the idea was put to her. \u201cToo soon,\u201d she says now. \u201cToo raw. Too disturbing for the public. I know I wouldn\u2019t want to watch that myself, never mind make it.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, Burstein received clearance to use the footage for a bolder, more wide-ranging project. <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11558924/\">Hillary</a>, the result, is a four-part biography that frames Clinton\u2019s life against the arc of the women\u2019s movement and recasts her career as a series of giant leaps and bounds. Significantly, it ends not in despair but in hope. Clinton, insists longtime adviser Cheryl Mills, is so much more than another stumbling pretender to the throne. She\u2019s a mould-breaker and a risk-taker. \u201cThe tip of the spear \u2013 the person who blazes the trail.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"872dc41094b07e17540b8915eafe54a6ba296199\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/872dc41094b07e17540b8915eafe54a6ba296199/0_0_4693_3157/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Every question is a potential hazard\u2019 \u2026 Nanette Burstein with Hillary Clinton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Every question is a potential hazard\u2019 \u2026 Nanette Burstein with Hillary Clinton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katie Jones/Variety/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If this makes it sound as if Hillary comes to praise Clinton not bury her \u2013 well, that\u2019s broadly the case (\u201clargely flattering\u201d, remarked the Hollywood Reporter). Yes, the documentary is at pains to cover its subject\u2019s myriad missteps and controversies, be it the lucrative Wall Street speeches, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/sep/21/hillaryclinton\">Whitewater real estate investment affair</a> or the overcooked saga of her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/18/clinton-emails-investigation-ends-state-department\">private email server</a>. But the talking heads are effectively defence witnesses, solid representatives of blue state USA. We hear nothing from Newt Gingrich, Sean Hannity, Lindsey Graham, or indeed any of her tormentors from the other side.</p> <p>This, Burstein says, was not for want of trying. \u201cBut Hillary is so toxic in that community that any association is seen as bad. I made it clear that it was an objective film and that I wanted their point of view. But they also knew that she was participating, which meant that it wasn\u2019t going to be some rightwing take-down of her \u2013 and anything short of that was unappealing.

She sat with Hillary for 35 hours of interviews, going back over her various \u2013 and often conflicting \u2013 incarnations as lawyer, first lady, senator and globe-trotting secretary of state. Perhaps most compellingly, she sat with Bill, who brokenly recalls his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/06/bill-clinton-monica-lewinsky-affair-anxiety\">cataclysmic affair with Monica Lewinsky</a>, likening himself to a weary boxer who grabs for something, anything, that might momentarily distract him from the fight. \u201cI\u2019m a totally different person now than I was 20 years ago,\u201d he insists \u2013 and the physical evidence would appear to bear him out. The former president, arguably the consummate politician of his age, now looks hollowed out, diminished and somehow older than his years.</p> <p>As for Hillary, who can say for certain? \u201cShe\u2019s not a confider,\u201d one friend needlessly points out. Instead, she sits ramrod straight in her book-lined sitting room, sipping coffee as make-up artists periodically dip in to attend to her hair. She\u2019s candid, impressive and radiates a certain blunt warmth. But on a personal level<strong>,</strong> she\u2019s as guarded as Fort Knox. Every question is a potential hazard. It needs to be quickly checked for tripwires and trapdoors.</p> <p>There is, of course, good reason for this. With the possible exception of Trump, no US politician inspires such fear and loathing. She\u2019s like a bespoke trigger for the red state white male. There they are \u2013 the MAGA army, the deplorables \u2013 burning her effigy at a rally in Kentucky and hollering \u201cIron my shirt!\u201d inside the town hall meet-and-greet. \u201cSmile!\u201d orders a shaven-head in camouflage pants as the candidate walks by \u2013 and, ever the pro, Clinton duly obliges.</p> <p>But it\u2019s small wonder that her smile is a firewall and her laugh flak. She\u2019s hemmed in on both sides, damned either way, regarded as an establishment neocon by the left and a radical feminist harpie by the right. Depressingly, these prejudices sometimes hop the fence: Clinton\u2019s decision to remain in her marriage only proved how weak she was, right up until the moment it proved that she was Lady Macbeth, a cold-blooded careerist. \u201cI\u2019m the most investigated innocent person in America,\u201d she snorts at the end of one interview session, when she perhaps believes herself to be off-mic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e58bfc60212ead11d490bfba0a4a341a8dcb455d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e58bfc60212ead11d490bfba0a4a341a8dcb455d/0_0_1100_619/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Firewall smile \u2026 Hillary with Bill in the early days.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Firewall smile \u2026 Hillary with Bill in the early days.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sundance film festival</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Burstein previously co-directed The Kid Stays in the Picture, a spry documentary about the Hollywood producer Robert Evans. She freely admits to being a Clinton supporter and feels that most of her problems were caused by forces beyond her control, a reflexive sexism in the land at large. But Burstein does believe that, occasionally, Clinton could have handled herself better. Maybe relaxed her defensive lawyerly crouch, or eased back on the well-paid corporate speaking gigs \u2013 for the sake of her public image, if nothing else.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The more you get used to seeing women in positions of power, the more likely you are to vote for it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf she has a flaw \u2013 and she has a few \u2013 it\u2019s the optics. Maybe she\u2019s not in the pocket of Wall Street, but to give speeches at a time when the banks are being bailed out, all the while knowing she\u2019s going to run for president \u2013 it looks bad. And she has this self-righteous quality that is her blind spot. She thinks, \u2018Well, I\u2019m not doing anything wrong, no one should think I\u2019m doing anything wrong, so who cares what it looks like?\u2019 And that\u2019s what gets her into trouble again and again.\u201d</p> <p>Bill, no doubt about it, was more adept at rolling with the punches, charming his way out of trouble, while Barack Obama\u2019s special power was rising nobly above the fray. But it\u2019s a fools\u2019 game to use past giants as a kind of roadmap to the White House. Both men (each pioneers in their way) still had to contend with a different set of hurdles to those faced by Hillary. And both, finally, could afford to be looser, less apologetic and more at ease with who they are.</p> <p>\u201cGreatness of spirit is the most important quality that a politician can have,\u201d says Joe Klein, one-time Time magazine columnist and bestselling author of Primary Colors, a loosely fictionalised novel about Bill\u2019s 1992 presidential campaign. \u201cThe successful Democrats \u2013 Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama \u2013 have all had it.

I mean, OK, maybe there\u2019s some truth to the idea that it\u2019s hard to pick a woman who has the kind of charm or the greatness of spirit that you see in a man. But is that because it doesn\u2019t exist? Or is it because it comes in a different package that we don\u2019t know how to recognise?\u201d</p> <p>Undeniably, Hillary offered a different package to the one presented by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>, the bait-and-switch conman who now sits in the Oval Office, presiding over a 100,000 Covid-19 death toll and an economy in the toilet. For all that, Burstein chooses to end her series not in the ash and rubble of November 2016, but amid the green shoots that have sprung up since. She spotlights the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/06/somethings-happening-how-the-womens-march-inspired-a-new-era-of-resistance\">5 million-strong Women\u2019s March</a> that followed the inauguration, the 2018 midterms that turned the lower house blue and the vibrant attempts of Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris to run for president. Obviously, it would have been heartening if one had secured the Democratic nomination. But can\u2019t narrow defeats and near misses be markers of progress, too?</p> <p>\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d Burstein says. \u201cBecause change happens incrementally. The fact that all those women ran for president in and of itself is a triumph. What happened in the midterm elections \u2013 that\u2019s a triumph as well. Because this is how it works. The more you see it happening, the more you get used to it. And the more you get used to seeing women in positions of power, the more likely you are to one day vote for it.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton forged the path. Many others now walk it.

  "<p>In the morning, reassurance, in the evening, another mass killing.&nbsp;</p> <p>When the governor for Sokoto state in north-west Nigeria arrived in Sabon Birni, a district reeling from relentless killings by armed groups, he assured local officials that authorities were in control. Police reinforcements would arrive soon, he added.</p> <p>Just hours after the governor left the town, 20km from Nigeria\u2019s northern border with Niger, more than 70 people were killed in five villages in the district.

Although \u201cbanditry\u201d encompasses a range of criminal activity conducted along various non-ethnic and ethnic factors, many of the recent large-scale armed attacks have been carried out by suspected Fulani assailants.&nbsp;</p> <p>Many Fulanis \u2013 nomadic pastoralists who span west Africa \u2013 face the twin threat of climate change and rapid population growth, both of which have diminished available land.</p> <p>In Nigeria, herders are encroaching on private landmore frequently as grazing reserves disappear.&nbsp;As such, historically muted disputes between Fulani pastoralists and farmers of various ethnicities over land resources have rapidly intensified.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"185681bc5e786d98c8560f490d2ea42c3d5ae666\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/185681bc5e786d98c8560f490d2ea42c3d5ae666/0_0_3780_2268/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Refugees fleeing violence in north-west Nigeria arrive at the Garin Kaka refugee site in Maradi, Niger in May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Refugees fleeing violence in north-west Nigeria arrive at the Garin Kaka refugee site in Maradi, Niger in May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNHCR/Selim Meddeb Hamrouni</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere is a long history of Fulbe (Fulani) and Hausa people living peacefully and having strong friendships and business ties,\u201d said Chitra Nagarajan, a conflict researcher in Nigeria. \u201cHowever, many Fulbe people, particularly in more rural areas, have felt not only completely marginalised from government interventions but that policies and programmes, for example the selling of grazing land, have reduced their livelihoods.\u201d</p> <p>Hausas think Fulani grievances are unfounded and given disproportionate attention, she said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Widespread poverty has heightened the appeal of armed criminality as a way of life. Kidnappings for ransom have become commonplace. Pastoralist life faces threats around the world, but in Nigeria the violence has been catalysed by poverty, a failure of local justice and ethnic divisions.</p> <p>Almost 70,000 people have fled north-west Nigeria to Niger since April 2019, including 30,000 in the last two months. According to the International Crisis Group, 11,000 people have died since 2011. Many deaths, particularly in Fulani communities, go unreported.&nbsp;</p> <p>Several army operations have been launched, but most have been largely ineffective.&nbsp;</p> <p>State governments in the region have resorted to signing controversial and secretive peace agreements with bandits and vigilantes to stop the killings.

They\u2019ve used forest tracks to import caches of heavy weapons.\u201d</p> <p>Nigeria\u2019s north-west and its porous border with Niger is gradually reconfiguring into a nexus for armed groups, he said. In many cases the groups are becoming more heavily armed than local police forces.&nbsp;</p> <p>A growing concern is that jihadists fleeing pressure in the north-east and coming south from Niger could establish roots in the north-west.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen some jihadist elements try to establish connections with bandit groups,\u201d Rufa\u2019i said. \u201cThey\u2019ve so far been unsuccessful but jihadists could see the region as ripe for gaining a foothold and exploiting local grievances.\u201d</p>",
