The estimates vary depending on the number, speed, and severity of infections, of course, but even the availability of testing affects the number of ventilators needed.... current estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60,000 to 160,000, depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included. The national strategic reserve of ventilators is small and far from sufficient for the projected gap.

The company pays only for hours they have actually worked and the government makes up the difference.

And when faced with a pandemic, the government sprung into action earlier than anywhere else in India.</p> \n  <p>Health minister, KK Shailaja, who swiftly earned the nickname \u201cCoronavirus Slayer\u201d, was the first in the country to assemble a taskforce in mid-February to begin aggressively contact tracing, testing and quarantining any possible cases. The state also closed all schools, restaurants and banned gatherings before any other and began setting up public sinks and hand sanitiser dispensers in public places, even at bus stops. The state has one of the highest testing rates in India, though it has also faced a shortage of testing kits.</p> \n  <p>And when prime minister Narendra Modi announced a nationwide lockdown on March 24 with four hours notice, causing havoc for the millions of migrant workers stuck thousands of miles from home. The Kerala authorities set up camps and provided provisions for their three million \u201cguest workers\u201d, preventing the dangerous exodus of people trying to get back home. A total of almost 19,000 relief camps have since been set up in Kerala, providing three meals a day. In comparison, in Uttar Pradesh, India\u2019s most populous state which has one of the highest numbers of migrant workers, just 2,000 camps have been set up.</p> \n  <p>Those in the camps are being given regular health checks and they even made arrangements to charge migrant workers phones, set up a helpline call centre which speaks five Indian languages. They also established a counselling service and when protests broke out in the camps by the migrant workers from northern states that they were only being fed rice, their diet was adapted to suit northern India tastes, including chapati, dal and pickle. In one camp, a Bengali kitchen was established. Across the state, mobile health workers are visiting the elderly and vulnerable.</p> \n  <p>Nonetheless, experts are warning against celebrating the state\u2019s success too early, especially as cases nationwide continue to steeply increase, and Kerala reported two new cases on Monday. On Sunday the Ministry of Home affairs also issued a rebuke to the Kerala state government for easing restrictions, with Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla issuing a thinly veiled warning against states that were \u201cdiluting\u201d the lockdown.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9d8a9a8f08b7689b031b05\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T11:52:17.138Z\">12.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>China\u2019s</strong> health authority called for a stronger and more rigorous testing regime to ensure that the new coronavirus does not escape detection, whether in travellers arriving from abroad or from other parts of the country. </p> \n  <p>All localities must improve their testing capabilities, including those at border crossings, and report any epidemic information in a timely manner, the National Health Commission cited its director Ma Xiaowei as saying.

It is the first known case in Borno, the epicentre of jihadist conflict that ravaged the region for over a decade. <br><br>According to a statement by MSF this morning, the aid worker, whose identity has not been revealed, tested positive in a post-mortem test. MSF said its teams \u201chave strengthened infection prevention measures, hygiene facilities, infection control and isolation spaces.\u201d<br><br>Authorities are now working to trace the worker\u2019s contacts and abate a spread of the virus within one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. <br><br>Almost two million people are displaced in northeast Nigeria, with almost 3 million in urgent need of food aid according to the World Food Programme. Several humanitarian organisations operate in the region, providing essential help. The insurgency has decimated the key services millions in the region rely on, including its health system.<br><br>On Sunday night, the UN said a major priority is to decongest refugee camps, where hundreds of thousands live in squalid conditions, unable to return to their homes. Yet it is a huge challenge as many areas across Borno and the north-east remain unsafe, exacerbated by a recent withdrawal of soldiers into so called super-camps. After relentless attacks by jihadists, soldiers have redeployed to better defend their positions but NGOs in the region say it has left many towns more vulnerable to insurgents.<br><br>There are 627 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country of 200 million people. Yet the daily rise in cases is gradually accelerating, with 86 new cases confirmed yesterday. Nigerian authorities have only tested about 7,000 people, and whilst countries around the world are struggling to boost testing capacity, many West African countries have tested more per million people. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9d80ef8f08b7689b031aba\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T11:01:19.677Z\">12.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">US scuppers G20 coronavirus statement on strengthening WHO</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>US hostility to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a> scuppered the publication of a communique by G20 health ministers on Sunday that committed to strengthening the WHO\u2019s mandate in coordinating a response to the global coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <p>In place of a lengthy statement with paragraphs of detail, the leaders instead issued a brief statement saying that gaps existed in the way the world handled pandemics.</p> \n  <p>The failure to agree on a statement will underline the extent to which the pandemic has become a theatre for a wider global disagreement between the US and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a> in which other nation states are finding themselves increasingly forced to take sides.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> has suspended US payments to the WHO in protest at what he regards as the body\u2019s China-centric approach, reflected \u2013 in his view \u2013 by its failure to challenge China sufficiently over the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak.</p> \n  <p>Tawfiq Al-Rabiah, the health minister for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/saudiarabia\">Saudi Arabia</a>, which was hosting the virtual summit, abruptly cancelled a planned press conference on Sunday, saying he urgently needed to attend a domestic coronavirus taskforce meeting.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/us-scuppers-g20-coronavirus-statement-on-strengthening-who\">Read more here.</a></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T11:28:11.285Z\">at 12.28pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9d71c78f08b7689b031a0e\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T11:00:48.220Z\">12.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u2019s a quick rundown of all the latest developments around the world on the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Spanish government is to propose that the European Union create a \u20ac1.5tn (\u00a31.3tn) fund to aid recovery in countries worst-hit by the coronavirus crisis, Spain\u2019s El Pais newspaper reported</strong>.

He said Japan\u2019s initial approach \u2013 to identify and contain infection clusters \u2013 had worked well until major cities such as Tokyo and Osaka started reporting significant rises in cases from the second half of March.</p> \n  <p>\u201cJapan\u2019s government should have changed strategy earlier,\u201d Iwata said, referring to the shift to wider testing combined with social distancing. \u201cThere was a tremendous delay and that has caused huge problems,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>Hospitals initially designated to treat patients with the illness had become unable to deal with the growing number of cases, leaving other hospitals unprepared to fill the treatment gap. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIf you aren\u2019t prepared and your staff aren\u2019t trained, you can\u2019t just admit Covid-19 patients,\u201d Iwata said. \u201cMany hospitals are not ready to fight against Covid-19. That\u2019s why [there have been reports] of ambulances going from one hospital to another\u201d in Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe and other cities.</p> \n  <p>He added: \u201cWe needed to change strategy immediately, but traditionally, Japan isn\u2019t good at doing that. When we have a plan A we are poor at converting it into a plan B.

Local governors can request that people stay home and that nonessential businesses close, but there are no fines or other penalties for non-compliance. In Tokyo, many places have closed their doors, but some bars, restaurants and cafes remain open, with many of the city\u2019s streets far from empty.<br><br>Iwata said the lack of urgency implicit in the measures meant people still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/clash-looms-in-japan-as-tokyo-governor-says-abes-covid-19-measures-not-enough\">hadn\u2019t understood the importance of staying home and social distancing</a>.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe government didn\u2019t send the right message to people \u2013 that you need to distance yourself from others to block the route of transmission.

  "<p>The police shooting of a 33-year-old man in a California Walmart over the weekend has led to intense backlash from civil rights activists, calls for protests and a Facebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SanLeandroPD/videos/256337682172155/\">video</a> from the local police chief to \u201cdispel some rumors\u201d about the incident.</p> <p>Police in San Leandro in the Bay Area shot Steven Taylor on Saturday afternoon after he wielded a baseball bat inside a local Walmart. A <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1323224997877628\">video</a> shot by a bystander captured two officers pointing their weapons at Taylor holding a bat near the doors on the Walmart floor.</p> <p>The footage appears to show one of the officers deploying a Taser after Taylor had dropped the bat on the floor and was lying on the ground. One witness is heard shouting, \u201cDon\u2019t shoot him no more!\u201d Police said one of the officers hit Taylor with a bullet in the upper torso, and the officers tried to use their Tasers multiple times during the confrontation.</p> <p>Lee Merritt, an attorney for Taylor\u2019s family, said Taylor was going through a mental health crisis on Saturday afternoon, and that he has previously suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar depression. \u201cHe was shot after he had become completely helpless and no longer represented a threat,\u201d Merritt told the Guardian on Monday.</p> <p>Merritt said he wasn\u2019t sure yet whether police shot Taylor with a Taser or bullet after he was already down, and that an autopsy was under way.</p> <p>Merritt also alleged that the officers provided insufficient care once Taylor was shot. \u201cTheir job, according to standard operating procedures, was to get Mr Taylor help. He had been seriously wounded and was suffering from a mental health crisis. They had to treat him quickly. They did the opposite and exacerbated his injuries,\u201d Merritt said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c01fd722e5a5611f6f0dc4c5fcc1830335fe653e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c01fd722e5a5611f6f0dc4c5fcc1830335fe653e/0_0_480_600/400.jpg\" alt=\"Steven Taylor\u2019s family is calling for charges against the officers who killed him.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steven Taylor\u2019s family is calling for charges against the officers who killed him.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Lee Merritt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The San Leandro police department <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SanLeandroPD/photos/a.675734449104602/3121159971228692/?type=3&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARDRKgXjqElsLwTdTT6BZbH10BqSytzLiaRd-xcl25CYyziYqY_PRQzfaiRQGIVPaqhTQ6EVBRvYEjCZt93xZh8wUldStQLFmQenIxh2GrLq0UAL6VmeoU8Tf6sHdpU88XF2jL7z7B803RE80NaH5sW24r6n49ENgCqAweikNYEg2Bl65A2H15-EFoOXvj65-ZZvX7N7xLnwFmt87LUtuV551zjB8qIiU4it89BoX3eLTVLODRn3TXZnheaKrfyMHQLizTpdnNrlY7pVurdqnBVPwwglh4sfTgkbnLAmmyXDHKbUQrAEfxQN1-vCEtIStOVeJX1pTbwIfyjiaVBdEhMmYw&amp;__tn__=-R\">said</a> Taylor had not complied with officers\u2019 commands to drop the bat and had walked toward police. At this point, one officer discharged his Taser \u201cwhich was not effective\u201d, according to the department. Then, police said, the officer fired his gun at Taylor, hitting him in the \u201cfront of his upper body\u201d. Seconds later, another officer discharged his Taser at the man, according to the department. Taylor died at the scene.</p> <p>Taylor\u2019s family is calling for charges against the officers. Merritt, who<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/17/diante-yarber-police-fatal-shooting-barstow-california\"> represents families</a> of those killed by police in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/17/diante-yarber-police-fatal-shooting-barstow-california\">federal litigation</a>, said the officers should face homicide charges for targeting Taylor after the threat was \u201cneutralized\u201d. He said police should have de-escalated by clearing the Walmart, surrounding Taylor and trying to talk him down, instead of quickly using lethal force.</p> <p>The San Leandro police chief, Jeff Tudor, said in an interview that the \u201cpop\u201d heard on the video after Taylor was already on the ground came from a Taser, and that it was too early to speculate whether that shot had hit Taylor or whether it was justified and in line with department policy. One officer was initially \u201ctrying to de-escalate the situation and grab the bat\u201d, Tudor said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s very tragic.\u201d</p> <p>On Sunday, Tudor publicly acknowledged that the shooting had upset many. \u201cOur community is hurting right now,\u201d Tudor said in a Facebook video. \u201cBut protecting the sanctity of life is extremely important. I know there are a lot of questions and concerns.\u201d</p> <p>Few details have emerged about Taylor since he was killed. Merritt said Taylor had three children, including an 11-year-old, and that he leaves behind three siblings. \u201cI hope they don\u2019t see their father executed like that,\u201d Merritt said.</p> <p>He added that Taylor \u201cwas best known for trying to make people laugh\u201d. </p> <p>The fatal shooting happened just south of Oakland, in a region where residents for years have organized Black Lives Matter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/21/oakland-police-misconduct-scandals-pile-up\">protests against police brutality</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/01/the-life-and-death-of-rapper-willie-mccoy-executed-by-police\">police shootings.</a></p> <p>Last year, California adopted the strictest law in the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/19/california-use-of-force-law-stephon-clark\">limiting when police can kill</a>, dictating that law enforcement must \u201creasonably believe \u2026 deadly force is necessary to defend against an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury\u201d. Typically, courts across the US have long ruled that shootings are justified if officers claimed they feared for their lives and were acting in self defense, a bar that advocates have said was too low and allowed police to kill civilians with impunity, particularly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/08/the-counted-police-killings-2016-young-black-men\">unarmed black Americans</a>.</p>",

  "<p>A massive deepwater oil spill is nearly as likely today as it was in 2010, experts warn, 10 years after the disastrous explosion of BP\u2019s rig in the Gulf of Mexico that caused an environmental catastrophe.</p> <p>The blowout killed 11 workers and spewed 4m barrels of petroleum into the ocean for 87 days before it could be capped, devastating marine life and polluting 1,300 miles of shoreline. Thousands were put out of work in oil, fisheries and tourism.</p> <p>But experts say an incident of similar scale could happen again and has been made more likely by the Trump administration\u2019s decision to loosen Obama-era safety rules. Those standards had grown from an independent commission\u2019s damning findings of corporate and regulatory failures leading up to the spill.</p> <p>Frances Ulmer, who served on the commission and is a visiting fellow at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School, said the government and industry have not made sufficient changes to prevent or respond to another mammoth spill.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/19/deepwater-horizon-mexico-10-years-on\">\u2018We\u2019ve been abandoned\u2019: a decade later, Deepwater Horizon still haunts Mexico</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cDisasters like oil spills will happen again because this is an extremely high-risk operation, particularly when you\u2019re talking about drilling for oil over a mile of water and then a couple miles down under the sea floor,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a lot of things that can go wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Frances Beinecke, another commission member and the former president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, echoed those worries.</p> <p>\u201cOf course it could happen again, and I think one of the things of most concern is that our ability to control a spill is pretty much the same as it was 10 years prior,\u201d Beinecke said. </p> <p>Richard Sears, the commission\u2019s senior science and engineering adviser, who formerly worked for Shell and is now an adjunct professor at Stanford University, said an accident like Deepwater Horizon was less likely now but \u201cthere are a lot worse scenarios that could happen in deep water\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5b7b69307a4b482e1ea84c6ade9ccad7311ac02b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b7b69307a4b482e1ea84c6ade9ccad7311ac02b/8_32_2021_1213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Engineers from the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement inspect an oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Engineers from the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement inspect an oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cEverybody has to stay vigilant,\u201d Sears said. He believes the Trump rule changes do not significantly weaken well safety but the government could do more to limit industry risk.</p> <p>Outside of safety concerns, the scientific community is also increasingly encouraging world leaders to consider that any new oil development is unwise, as emissions from fossil fuels exacerbate global heating, threatening human civilization.</p> <p>In the wake of the BP disaster, the US interior department restructured in an effort to allow a new division of the agency, the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement (BSEE), to focus on safety. The move was meant to separate safety regulators from government officials who might be more incentivized by the money coming in from taxes on drilling.</p> <p>The Obama administration beefed up safety rules, including checks on blowout preventers like the one that failed on BP\u2019s Deepwater Horizon rig.</p> <p>Now Trump has weakened those standards at the behest of the industry\u2019s trade group, the American Petroleum Institute, including allowing inspections by non-government-accredited contractors<strong>.</strong></p> <p>Trump has pushed an agenda of \u201cenergy dominance\u201d, which critics say encourages industry to take risks.</p> <p>A constant ally of fossil fuels, Trump has sought to allow drilling in nearly all coastal waters in the US \u2013 more than 1bn acres in the Atlantic, Pacific, Arctic and Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>His officials have been accommodating to the corporations they regulate, with BSEE\u2019s director repeatedly calling them \u201cpartners\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBSEE is transitioning from an era of isolation to cooperation, from creating hardships to creating partnerships,\u201d the bureau director, Scott Angelle, said at an industry symposium in August 2017.</p> <p>Internal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-safety-rules-on-oil-drilling-were-changed-some-staff-objected-those-notes-were-cut-11582731559\">emails</a> suggest expert agency staffers have disagreed with the rollbacks to drilling safety rules and Angelle has refused to document their concerns.

Low oil prices \u2013 from a boom in production on land following the discovery of fracking \u2013 haven\u2019t kept them out of the water. Most of the $93m in leases sold by the US in the Gulf last month were in <a href=\"https://www.ogj.com/general-interest/government/article/14170058/gulf-of-mexico-lease-sale-yields-93-million-in-winning-bids\">deep water</a>.</p> <p>\u201cOffshore drilling is going after bigger and bigger wells that have more and more oil,\u201d said Bob Deans, a spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council who co-wrote a book on the BP disaster. \u201cThese are being drilled in deep water and they\u2019re being drilled in high pressure wells that are harder to control. And they\u2019re being drilled in more complex geology.\u201d</p> <p>One study found that for every 100ft deeper a well is drilled, documented incidents <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030142151201141X?via%3Dihub\">increase 8.5%</a>.</p> <p>The Deepwater Horizon rig reached about 5,000ft, or close to a mile, down. Other platforms still operating in the Gulf are as deep or deeper. One drilled in 2001, called \u201cBlind Faith\u201d, is still producing, according to 2019 documents from Chevron. It reaches 7,000ft to the Gulf floor.</p> <p>Deans called the current regulatory approach \u201can honor system\u201d that \u201csmacks of exactly the kind of self-enforcement that the independent commission found to be a fatal flaw\u201d in the BP blowout.</p> <p>\u201cDefinitely, it could happen again,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot make these operations safe. All you can do is try to reduce the risk.\u201d</p> <p>Smaller-scale incidents that don\u2019t make the news occur frequently in the Gulf. Between 2007 and 2018, there were an average of 115 fires and explosions in federal waters annually, about one every three days, according to government data <a href=\"https://usa.oceana.org/publications/reports/hindsight-2020-lessons-we-cannot-ignore-bp-disaster?_ga=2.77377884.815579413.1587658951-544184516.1586886135#\">reviewed by the environment campaign Oceana</a>. There were also nearly 50 fatalities over that time.</p> <p>Donald Boesch, a biological oceanographer and president of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, who was also on the commission, said Trump\u2019s changes have undermined offshore safety.</p> <p>\u201cMany steps have been taken by both government and industry since the accident 10 years ago \u2026 I felt comfortable \u2013 not that the risk was reduced to negligible \u2013 but that we were in better shape now than we were,\u201d Boesch said. \u201cI\u2019ve frankly been made more concerned about how the safety issues are being treated under the Trump administration.\u201d</p> <p>Still, sources familiar with industry say the big companies learned a lesson as they watched BP suffer huge reputational damage and pay $65bn for its mistakes.</p> <p>Wesley Williams, a petroleum engineering professor at Louisiana State University, who was awarded a nearly $5m research grant from a fund BP was forced to pay into, said the \u201creal motivator\u201d for industry was \u201cthe image issue that happened and the financial cost of what happened to BP\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/18/gulf-coast-deepwater-horizon-oil-industry-louisiana\">'I pray to God it never happens again': US gulf coast bears scars of historic oil spill 10 years on</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFrom the large operators, I\u2019ve seen a big change in safety culture,\u201d Williams said.</p> <p>But the sector consists of more than just the brands most people can identify, like BP, Shell and Exxon. Those companies work with large networks of contractors, and smaller independent operators are active in the Gulf of Mexico too. Williams said they did not always have the resources for extensive safety training.</p> <p>John Amos, president of SkyTruth, a not-for-profit conservation technology organization, said:</p> <p>\u201cThe next major oil spill, when it happens, will catch us off guard \u2026 like every previous one has, unless we decide that this time it\u2019s going to be different,\u201d Amos said.</p>",
  "<p>These are the weirdest of times. Oil prices, which during the last crisis hit $147 a barrel, have just turned negative. That\u2019s right. Crude is so cheap they are giving it away.</p> <p>So much for the idea of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/10/opec-russia-reduce-oil-production-prop-up-prices\">top</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/10/opec-russia-reduce-oil-production-prop-up-prices\">-level deal</a> to put a floor under oil prices. Little more than a week ago, all the talk from Donald Trump was of how he had banged heads together and forced Russia and Saudi Arabia into production curbs that would bring global supplies of crude more into line with demand. On Monday night, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/oil-prices-sink-to-20-year-low-as-un-sounds-alarm-on-to-covid-19-relief-fund\">price of US benchmark crude </a>was -$38 a barrel.</p> <p>The reason for an unprecedented one-day collapse in the price is partly technical. Crude for June delivery is trading at more than $20 a barrel. That said, the chances of a binding deal always looked fanciful. The oil cartel Opec does not have the power it once wielded, even when the group is expanded to include Russia. </p> <p>The west\u2019s shutdown means oil demand has plummeted. There are supertankers out at sea full to the brim with crude at a time when storage facilities \u2013 especially in the US \u2013 are close to capacity. The number of active US rigs has fallen by 35% in the past month, because many are now uneconomic.</p> <p>The cost of crude will eventually start to rise again, but not because of Trump\u2019s browbeating, nor because of a Moscow-Riyadh deal, but because there is a more powerful force at work: the price mechanism.</p> <h2>Sunak\u2019s startup support scheme responds to a real threat</h2> <p>Rishi Sunak\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/20/coronavirus-rishi-sunak-offers-fast-growing-uk-companies-125bn-in-loans\">decision to support innovative start</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/20/coronavirus-rishi-sunak-offers-fast-growing-uk-companies-125bn-in-loans\">up companies</a> is the latest example of political cross-dressing by the government. First it was higher public spending, then it was stepping in to subsidise jobs. Now it is the ultimate throwback to the 1970s: picking winners.</p> <p>Under the chancellor\u2019s new scheme, the government will provide <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/20/coronavirus-rishi-sunak-offers-fast-growing-uk-companies-125bn-in-loans\">loans to companies</a> in which private investors have already put money. If the loans can\u2019t be repaid, the Treasury will pick up an equity stake at a knockdown price, providing a potential upside for the taxpayer if the company does \u2013 let\u2019s say \u2013 come up with the latest big thing in artificial intelligence or a treatment for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19.</a></p> <p>The evidence from the flurry of Treasury action since the UK went into lockdown suggests it is wise to study the detail before making a judgment on a scheme\u2019s merit. But notwithstanding the need to study the small print, Sunak\u2019s decision to intervene is welcome.</p> <p>For decades the idea that the government could second-guess the markets and identify companies with growth potential has been a term of political abuse in the UK, but what happened 40 or 50 years ago was not really about picking winners so much as bailing out losers.</p> <p>The case for providing financial support for innovative firms is strong, not least because many of them are startups, and so don\u2019t qualify for help under the other packages the chancellor has announced.</p> <p>Even in the best of times, companies that tend to burn through cash quickly and are some distance away from making a profit can find life challenging. There are plenty of reasons for that: banks that are unwilling to lend; a much less developed venture capital industry than in the US; a longstanding difficulty in turning ideas into commercial products.</p> <p>Sunak, with his background in the hedge fund industry, has taken personal interest in the package for innovative firms, and it is right that the chancellor is responding to the very real threat that the firms of the future will be decimated by the pandemic.</p> <p>This is a high-risk sector and there will be companies that go bust, taking the state\u2019s money with them.

That has focused not exclusively but largely on making sure we are testing NHS and care workers and their families where that is appropriate.</p> \n   <p>There\u2019s more than 12,000 NHS and care workers and their families had been tested. We are trying to get many more care workers through testing given the severity and urgency of the issues in the care sector; surveillance testing as we go through this next phase to inform decisions that we\u2019re taking will be a key part of that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Gary Smith, from the <strong>GMB</strong> Scotland trade union, which represents care workers, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is simply not credible at this stage in the crisis for us to be testing this kind of number.

Broadly he has been trying to avoid criticising the government, but in an interview with the BBC\u2019s <strong>Victoria Derbyshire</strong> he got sucked into the argument about whether Boris Johnson was at fault for missing five meetings of the Cobra emergency committee on coronavirus in the early weeks of the crisis.</p> \n  <p>This was the central allegation in <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-38-days-when-britain-sleepwalked-into-disaster-hq3b9tlgh\">a Sunday Times Insight investigation published yesterday (paywall).</a> That prompted the government to publish <a href=\"https://healthmedia.blog.gov.uk/2020/04/19/response-to-sunday-times-insight-article/\">a 2,000-word rebuttal last night</a> that said, among other things, that the Sunday Times was wrong to say Cobra was normally chaired by the PM.</p> \n  <p>Asked if Johnson should have attended those Cobra meetings, Blair largely avoided the invitation to criticise the PM - although he did insinuate that Johnson might have been somewhat negligent. Blair said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I just don\u2019t want to be in that game because I know how difficult it is for all of them.</p> \n   <p>People ask me: were there any Cobra meetings you missed?

Obviously if you have Cobra it\u2019s because it is a serious emergency.</p> \n   <p>I\u2019m sure the people in government have been doing everything they possibly can. I think the most important thing is not who\u2019s doing their job well and who\u2019s doing it badly, it\u2019s whether you have the right combination of skill at the centre of government to handle some of these things.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But Derbyshire came back to the topic towards the end of what was a long interview, and this time she did get Blair to come out with a more direct criticism. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If you talk to people in government themselves, I think what they would say is in the period of the initial start of the disease, in the period in other words between the start of the disease and the suppression, I think most people would accept the government was somewhat behind the curve.

  "<p>\u201cI have a very pragmatic approach to doping,\u201d Larry Olubamiwo says after he has told me of another sporting great he is convinced used performance-enhancing drugs. \u201cI make it akin to life and the saying that links both is \u2018better living through chemistry\u2019. As a society we use drugs to enhance ourselves. We wake up and drink a cup of coffee that has caffeine in it. That\u2019s a drug. People drink alcohol to numb pain or relax. That\u2019s a drug. Nicotine is a drug.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is the difference between someone using these drugs and an athlete using other drugs to improve themselves? Many athletes dope to make money for themselves and their family. My first goal as a boxer was always to make a living.\u201d</p> <p>The former heavyweight boxer was <a href=\"https://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/8065842/british-boxer-larry-olubamiwo-suspended-doping\" title=\"\">banned for four years in 2012</a> after using 13 banned substances including EPO, human growth hormone and steroids. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/jun/16/larry-olubamiwo-boxing-drugs-banned\" title=\"\">His ban was then reduced</a> to a year after Olubamiwo offered information to UK Anti-Doping.</p> <p>Olubamiwo is now scathing about Ukad and the 41-year-old speaks with breathtaking freedom, or audacity, when suggesting that \u201cprobably 90%\u201d of elite-level boxers today are doping. It sounds outlandish but Olubamiwo, who has a degree in pharmaceutical chemistry, is worth hearing. Most of his allegations are libellous and, without concrete proof, cannot be printed. But even if only a tenth of his revelations can be proved it would be a shocking indictment of sport.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/28/sun-yang-benefited-from-convenient-friendship-with-swimmings-chiefs\">The worrying 'friendship' between swimming chiefs and Sun Yang | Andy Bull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Administrators, promoters, sponsors and romantic sports fans will dismiss Olubamiwo as an irksome carnival barker. After Olubamiwo first discussed doping in boxing with Richard Poxon and Anthony Crolla on their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRojSDpaGo&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Blackeye Barber podcast</a>, Eddie Hearn demeaned his allegations as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb5T2YBWbMc\">\u201ca ridiculous statement\u201d</a>. Hearn also said it was wrong to \u201csingle out pay-per-events as they get additional testing\u201d as pay-per-view fighters \u201chave anything between eight- to 14-week testing programmes with VADA where they are testing two to three times a week\u201d.</p> <p>Olubamiwo, however, believes doping is so rife that performance-enhancing drugs should be legalised. \u201cI\u2019m a big <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/oct/05/ben-johnson-drugs-olympics\" title=\"\">Ben Johnson</a> fan,\u201d he says of the disgraced Canadian sprinter who was busted for doping after the 100m final at the 1988 Olympics.</p> <p>Olubamiwo is kind towards Charlie Francis \u2013 Johnson\u2019s denigrated former coach. \u201cI\u2019m a big Charlie Francis fan. Francis believed hormones made naturally in the body \u2013 EPO, human growth hormone and testosterone \u2013 should be allowed as supplements. Maybe ban the synthetic stuff \u2013 anabolic steroids and other drugs. He reasoned that stuff made in the body was safe if taken in reasonable doses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"987b1eb3bfb2bc26864b6cf9e6199ddb3d2d8584\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/987b1eb3bfb2bc26864b6cf9e6199ddb3d2d8584/0_1_2400_2998/801.jpg\" alt=\"Larry Olubamiwo.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Larry Olubamiwo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Scott</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always subscribed to his thinking that this would make it a more level playing field. This is one of the main reasons for doping because it\u2019s never equal. One guy has a better coach than another. One guy can afford better equipment and warm-weather training. Sport is never fair.</p> <p>\u201cTake creatine. When it first came out they tried to ban it. But when they realised it was natural [and produced in muscle cells], and occurred in food, they couldn\u2019t ban it. Creatine improves performance a helluva lot. It\u2019s safe but if people use it too much they [can] develop problems.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between creatine and testosterone? It\u2019s hypocrisy to say one thing is OK and the other isn\u2019t. If you allow athletes to use these substances it makes it more equal. For safety, you can test athletes\u2019 health markers and make sure they\u2019re not using more dangerous stuff.\u201d</p> <p>Setting aside moral concerns about legalising EPO, human growth hormone and testosterone, doping increases the danger of boxing. Boxers are maimed and killed in the ring. If power is enhanced artificially even more damage will be caused.</p> <p>\u201cI hear that argument all the time,\u201d Olubamiwo says. \u201cBut most boxing deaths happen because of the accumulation of blows. If you\u2019re enhanced, if you have more power, the fight wouldn\u2019t last as long. Your opponent wouldn\u2019t sustain as much damage. If you\u2019re on the receiving end and you\u2019re enhanced, it increases your resilience to punishment. It actually helps fighters both ways.\u201d</p> <p>This seems a spurious argument. No supplement can safeguard the brain when a pulverising blow smashes into a boxer\u2019s head. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to safeguard the brain,\u201d Olubamiwo agrees, \u201cbut growth hormone can thicken your skull. It can increase the water around the brain inside the skull.\u201d</p> <p>I have heard too many neurosurgeons talk about the damage done to a brain by a heavy blow to believe Olubamiwo\u2019s theory. But, rather than dismiss everything he says, his story offers valuable pointers into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/drugs-in-sport\" title=\"\">doping</a> mindset. Before he became a boxer Olubamiwo was a promising sprinter who began doping at 19. He plays down his own sprinting prowess. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/jan/20/dwayne-chambers-usain-bolt-athletics-interview-donald-mcrae\" title=\"\">Dwain Chambers</a> is my age. When I was running 100m in 10.7, he was running 10.1.\u201d</p> <p>Chambers was eventually exposed for doping. \u201cHe probably was using then \u2013 but so was I. It wasn\u2019t just at the top. It was most athletes trying to get to the top. At first I thought it was just sprinters but then I got friendly with long-distance runners and throwers. Doping\u2019s across the board.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f7b09183f817cf8a80ad03367d0448c8aaa203f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f7b09183f817cf8a80ad03367d0448c8aaa203f/0_59_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Larry Olubamiwo defeats Yavor Marinchev at the Harvey Hadden Leisure Centre, Nottingham in 2009\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Larry Olubamiwo defeats Yavor Marinchev at the Harvey Hadden Leisure Centre, Nottingham in 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TGS/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At 20, Olubamiwo turned to boxing. He was even more convinced of the need to dope because \u201cyou don\u2019t go into a gun-fight carrying a knife\u201d. Doping was so pervasive that Olubamiwo did not feel any ethical qualms. \u201cI\u2019m not saying everyone is on drugs. But a sizeable amount of people are on drugs. I made the informed decision to use and compete with the best.\u201d</p> <p>Olubamiwo was jailed between the ages of 21 and 26 for armed robbery. He came out of prison and completed his degree and was a day short of 30 when he finally made his pro boxing debut in October 2008. Promoted by Frank Maloney, he won 10 of his first 11 fights.</p> <p>Olubamiwo describes how easy it was to gain a supply of PEDs. \u201cOnly EPO is more challenging. It\u2019s not as available as anabolic steroids or growth hormone. It\u2019s a stamina drug, a very niche drug. I got EPO online from a pharmaceutical company in China.\u201d</p> <p>With his scientific knowledge did he consider the side-effects? \u201cSide-effects come with abuse. I always thought that use is when you use it to optimise yourself without compromising your health. Abuse is compromising your health. I did things very safely. If I didn\u2019t have my knowledge, I would have hired someone. I didn\u2019t take huge doses because I\u2019m usually cautious.\u201d</p> <p>Does he have any side-effects now? \u201cNot at all. Healthy as a horse.\u201d</p> <p>Was there more doping in boxing than athletics? \u201cThat\u2019s an interesting question. At first I would have said athletes were the biggest users. But going further into boxing I realised it was pretty much the same. It\u2019s just that boxing has been very late to anti-doping.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The guys who are doing the real doping, you can\u2019t touch. You don\u2019t have the money</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Olubamiwo was not tested once between October 2008 and January 2012. \u201cThat\u2019s what led me to become complacent with my protocol. When I started I was very meticulous about when I came on and off. Wrote down dates. Clearance times. But as I wasn\u2019t being tested, I thought: \u2018I don\u2019t have to keep track.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>If he had remained rigorous, Olubamiwo believes he would never have been caught. But his career hit the skids when he lost a controversial decision against Sam Sexton in January 2012. The real controversy, however, soon broke. \u201cI knew the writing was on the wall because there was no way I could flush EPO out my system,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI was tested before the fight.\u201d</p> <p>The US Anti-Doping Agency had tipped off Ukad because it had discovered Olubamiwo\u2019s name while trawling through the records of all those who had ordered EPO from China. Olubamiwo did not fight the charges because he was \u201csick of the lies\u201d. He harbours no bitterness that he is one of the minority of British boxers who have been caught cheating. His anger towards Ukad stems from the fact that he claims the agency broke a legally binding contract to return his 3,000 pills once he retired.</p> <p>He says the tablets were steroids and that, in ordinary society, \u201cthey are 100% legal\u201d, adding: \u201cLegally they had no right to take them off of me in the first place.

They wouldn\u2019t have got that information if that contract wasn\u2019t signed. So they got it through false pretences. That\u2019s why I\u2019m livid.\u201d</p> <p>Surely it would be unethical for Ukad to return medication banned in elite sport to a convicted doper? \u201cIf they want to look at things ethically, we need to look at things legally. Legally, they weren\u2019t even allowed to take that stuff off of me.</p> <p>\u201cThey did it under false pretences by saying: \u2018They\u2019re a class A drug blah blah.\u2019 They were perfectly legal to have in my possession.

They can\u2019t be seen to get away with this.\u201d</p> <p>Olubamiwo is deeply cynical. \u201cA whole host of shady things are happening with anti-doping organisations around the world.

  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/metropolitan-police\">Metropolitan police</a> are to review the role of officers in schools after a legal challenge raised concerns that they could have a disproportionately negative effect on pupils from black and minority ethnic groups.</p> <p>The challenge, brought on behalf of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/30/met-to-face-judicial-review-over-role-of-school-police-officers\">the family of a </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/30/met-to-face-judicial-review-over-role-of-school-police-officers\">14-year-old boy</a> who is black and has autism, was withdrawn after police agreed to carry out further analysis of the Met\u2019s safer schools partnerships (SSP) and the role of safer schools officers (SSO).</p> <p>Under the SSP, schools in the capital and elsewhere in the country have police officers attached to them for the safety and security of pupils and staff.

For an invigorating reminder of what a truly world-class band this is, try Brahms\u2019s Second Symphony conducted by <a href=\"https://www.harrisonparrott.com/artists/pablo-heras-casado\">Pablo Heras-Casado</a>. It\u2019s a comparatively clean-shaven reading of the piece \u2013 stylish rather than high-Romantic \u2013 in which the lower strings are velvety, woodwind solos beguile and the brass provide irresistibly high-shine climaxes. Or for an adventure beyond standard repertory, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=3172106199681866\">watch (on Facebook)</a> the \u201cdigital soup concert\u201d of piano quartets by two late 19th-century female Swedish composers, recorded by three of the orchestra\u2019s principal string players and pianist Martin Sturf\u00e4lt in early April (and all observing social distancing). <a href=\"http://www.swedishmusicalheritage.com/composers/andree-elfrida/\">Elfrida Andr\u00e9e</a>\u2019s work is a real discovery \u2013 new to me, at least. Its three movements demonstrate a composer absolutely in control of her medium, the musical gestures bold, the textures subtle. The performance is a joy, too: intensely hot-blooded throughout. <strong>Flora Willson</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbae25aef08b7a22c6228a15c8eb3d9ec2687a24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbae25aef08b7a22c6228a15c8eb3d9ec2687a24/41_15_727_436/500.jpg\" alt=\"Stockhausen Samstag aus Licht le Balcon, June 2019\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Creaky dramaturgy but extraordinary music ...

They began with Donnerstag (Thursday), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/22/donnerstag-aus-licht-review-stockhausen-cosmic-opera\">a staging that came to London last year</a>, just before they embarked on this second instalment in <a href=\"https://live.philharmoniedeparis.fr/concert/1111564/?lang=en-US\">Paris at the Philharmonie</a>, again conducted by Maxime Pascal and directed with stylish economy by Damien Bigourdan. In Stockhausen\u2019s personal mythology, Samstag (Saturday) is Lucifer\u2019s Day, and he is the work\u2019s only solo voice, a bass (sung here by Damien Pass). The other protagonists are instrumental \u2013 piano, flute, trombone, percussion \u2013 though there is also a chorus of monks in the final scene, Lucifer\u2019s Farewell (which, in this production, is performed not in the concert hall, but in a nearby church). As ever in Licht, the dramaturgy is creaky, the narrative hard to take seriously; but as ever in Stockhausen, too, the music is often extraordinary, from the opening Saturday Greeting, in which groups of baleful brass surround the audience, through the solo-piano Lucifer\u2019s Dream, the singing flautist of Lucifer\u2019s Requiem and the orchestral tour de force of Lucifer\u2019s Dance, to the farewell, in which the monks chant a Franciscan text, before smashing coconuts on the steps of the church. <strong>Andrew Clements</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLmxbXT8uW8&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Beethoven string trios: Sepec/Zimmermann/Queyras</a> (Wigmore Hall Live)</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/06/opera-and-classical-concerts-to-watch-at-home--critics-picks-week-three\">Opera and classical concerts to watch at home: our critics' picks, week three</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If nothing else, the Covid-19 lockdown provides an opportunity to remedy gaps in one\u2019s musical knowledge. This<a href=\"https://wigmore-hall.org.uk/watch-listen/live-stream\"> live-streamed Wigmore concert</a> plugged a hole for me. The young Beethoven wrote five string trios between 1794 and 1798 before abandoning the genre in favour of quartets. The string trios are not often played, let alone all in one evening as they were here by the classy Franco-German trio of violinist Daniel Sepec, violist Tabea Zimmermann and cellist Jean-Guihen Queyras. There\u2019s a distinct development in Beethoven\u2019s treatment of the trio format between the multi-movement Op 3 trio and the Op 8 serenade on the one hand, and the more assertive aesthetic of the three trios Op 9 on the other. Best of all is Op 9 no 1 in G, which generates a beguiling back-and-forth response between the players. Yet the trios all constantly prefigure the muscularity of the later Beethoven chamber style at times, and the playing is alert and vigorous throughout. The concert is a bit of a marathon, lasting more than three and a half hours with intervals. But online you can hit the pause button from time to time and give each of these works the attention they deserve. <strong>Martin Kettle</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a12adb67fce72ff876386b95880fa56298f13ed1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a12adb67fce72ff876386b95880fa56298f13ed1/33_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fine vocal performances: Dutch National Opera\u2019s 2011 production of Eugene Onegin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fine vocal performances ...

It was staged by Stefan Herheim at a time when he was very much European opera\u2019s flavour of the month, and it\u2019s well populated with the directorial tropes that have since become rather predictable in his shows. This production flits between present-day Russia and the era of Pushkin\u2019s original poem, stopping off at a number of historic moments in between; a Russian bear is among the guests at the Larins\u2019s ball, Lensky turns into Lenin during the second act, while among the dancers in the third-act polonaise are Rasputin, Nicholas II, Soviet cosmonauts and muscle-bound medal-winning Olympians. None of it provides much enlightenment on the opera or its characters, though the score is conducted with wonderful assurance by Jansons and there are some fine vocal performances, even if Skovhus and Stoyanova make a rather too mature central pairing. <strong>Andrew Clements</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.concertgebouworkest.nl/en/strauss-also-sprach-zarathustra\">Strauss from the Royal Concertgebouw</a></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/23/opera-and-classical-your-home-watching-guide-critics-picks\">Opera and classical home watching picks: critics pick their highlights</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Amsterdam\u2019s Royal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/concertgebouw-orchestra\">Concertgebouw Orchestra</a> has always had an enviable track record when it comes to Richard Strauss, who first conducted them himself in 1897, and was so impressed he eventually dedicated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/jan/21/classicalmusicandopera.shopping2\">Ein Heldenleben</a> to them. <a href=\"https://www.concertgebouworkest.nl/en/video-overview\">The orchestra\u2019s video archive</a> contains a number of outstanding performances of his work, of which pride of place probably goes to a magisterial account of <a href=\"https://www.concertgebouworkest.nl/en/strauss-also-sprach-zarathustra\">Also Sprach Zarathustra</a> from 2012, conducted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/04/mariss-jansons-interview-fiona-maddocks\">Mariss Jansons</a>. He brings tremendous fixity of purpose to it, so that a work that can often turn episodic progresses as a single arc of sound that proves overwhelming from the famous sunrise with which it begins to the tonally ambivalent nocturne that brings it to its close. There\u2019s also an excellent <a href=\"https://www.concertgebouworkest.nl/en/strauss-till-eulenspiegels-lustige-streiche\">Till Eulenspiegel</a> from 2016, conducted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/andris-nelsons\">Andris Nelsons</a>, who gets its bittersweet humour spot on, in an interpretation that avoids the usual trap of sprinting through it and maintains absolute textural clarity throughout. <strong>Tim Ashley</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/16/classical-music-opera-livestream-at-home-coronavirus\">Lockdown listening: classical music and opera to stream at home</a></strong></p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>Digital contact tracing will fail unless governments build the technology in a way that respects user privacy, a group of nearly 300 experts have warned.</p> \n<p>If public health bodies such as the NHS build centralised contact tracing apps that transmit superfluous data they will struggle to win the trust of enough citizens to ensure the activity is a success, the experts say.</p> \n<p>The joint letter, signed by academics from 26 countries worldwide, highlights the potential that digital contact tracing has in helping prevent a resurgence of Covid-19 as countries come out of lockdown, but cautions that the effectiveness is no excuse for riding roughshod over privacy protections \u2013 and is, in fact, closely entwined with them.</p> \n<p>\u201cSuch apps can otherwise be repurposed to enable unwarranted discrimination and surveillance,\u201d the letter states. \u201cIt is crucial that citizens trust the applications in order to produce sufficient uptake to make a difference in tackling the crisis. It is vital that, in coming out of the current crisis, we do not create a tool that enables large-scale data collection on the population, either now or at a later time.</p> \n<p>\u201cThus, solutions which allow reconstructing invasive information about the population should be rejected without further discussion.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/how-did-britain-get-its-response-to-coronavirus-so-wrong\">How did Britain get its coronavirus response so wrong?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>On Monday, the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, told MPs any tracing app designed to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 would be \u201cfunctionally limited\u201d to prevent a \u201cmission creep\u201d that would change the relationship between the individual and the state.</p> \n<p>Buckland told a remote session of the joint committee on human rights: \u201cOn every occasion that government or its agencies seek to create a device or mechanism that has potential of infringing rights or other fundamental civil liberties then the greatest care has to be taken.</p> \n<p>\u201cThus far, I\u2019m seeing a proper prioritisation of the need for privacy and indeed for security when it comes to the data that might be contained in such a tracing device.</p> \n<p>\u201cClearly speed is of the essence, because of the situation we\u2019re in, but the need for an ethical approach and legal approach is very much at the heart of what the NHS is doing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Digital contact tracing, pioneered by Singapore in late March, uses the Bluetooth connection in modern smartphones to keep track of meetings between individuals, in order to allow self-isolation instructions to be sent automatically to everyone a newly diagnosed patient has interacted with while infectious.</p> \n<p>It is possible to carry out such tracing without needing to build a centralised database of every meeting between individuals, which could be abused by authoritarian governments or overzealous officials: one proposal, backed by Apple and Google, sees every smartphone build a decentralised record of only the other phones it has interacted with, and waiting to hear from the state if any of those phones have been marked as infectious.</p> \n<p>But the NHS is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/16/nhs-in-standoff-with-apple-and-google-over-coronavirus-tracing\">understood to be focusing on a different approach</a>, which uploads far more data. That brings with it numerous technological hurdles, since it won\u2019t be supported by the two main smartphone operating systems, and has sparked concern among privacy campaigners.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In a statement, NHSX said: \u201c\u201cUsers\u2019 privacy is crucial, which is why we are working with other countries, a range of experts, stakeholders and industry to ensure the app under development is led by the best scientific and clinical advice to reduce transmission of the virus whilst protecting user privacy.\u201d</p> \n<p>The academics\u2019 warning is backed up by a cautionary report from the Ada Lovelace Institute, an independent thinktank that focuses on issues around data and AI. The institute argued that any future contact-tracing app must be backed by specific legislation regulating the processing of data, must \u201cencourage privacy-by-design in technical implementations and must choose privacy-preserving protocols to underscore technical measures\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is a real risk that the expansion of state intrusion into individuals\u2019 lives that occurs during emergencies endures beyond the originating crisis,\u201d the report said. \u201cTechnical and legal infrastructure built during this pandemic may be difficult to dismantle once it is over unless proper safeguards are in place.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cOpen debate and scrutiny must be encouraged, to increase trust and raise public awareness of the complexity of the issues.\u201d</p> \n<p>Any contact-tracing app would need to be used by more than half the total population to be effective, <a href=\"https://www.research.ox.ac.uk/Article/2020-04-16-digital-contact-tracing-can-slow-or-even-stop-coronavirus-transmission-and-ease-us-out-of-lockdown\">according to research from Oxford University</a>.

But if the NHS succeeds in getting 60% of the UK to install and run the app, says Christophe Fraser, the report\u2019s senior author, it \u201chas the potential to substantially reduce the number of new coronavirus cases, hospitalisations and ICU admissions\u201d.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>IT\u2019S A HARDBALL WORLD, SON</strong></h2> <p>Having spent spent several months doing drills, running on command, dropping to do press-ups and participating in shooting practice under the watchful eye of a sullen, often angry and foul-mouthed drill instructor at Tottenham\u2019s training ground, the prospect of going on military service should hold little fear for Son Heung-min. Despite being excused from an 18-month stint in the army as a reward for helping South Korea win the Asian Cup two years ago, the Tottenham forward has now swapped his comfortable, magenta Nike training duds for army fatigues as he begins a three-week course of basic training with his country\u2019s marine corps. Semper fi, Sonny! Semper fi!</p> <p>While his naughty Tottenham drill instructor was breaking social distancing rules to conduct some basic training of his own in a Barnet park a couple of weeks ago, Son was in South Korea putting himself through two weeks of self-isolation before heading off to the volcanic island of Jeju. There, in the cliched tradition of Full Metal Jacket and other war movies, we could imagine he will be shouted at on the parade ground by an angry man in a big hat, get given a cool nickname like \u201cCowboy\u201d, \u201cJoker\u201d or \u201cEightball\u201d, learn the Rifleman\u2019s Creed, almost certainly be the best in his class on the assault course and possibly use his downtime to tempt fate by boring his fellow recruits to tears by showing them photos of his sweetheart back home.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/20/tottenham-son-heung-min-starts-military-service-in-south-korea-marine-corps-three-weeks\">Tottenham's Son Heung-min starts military service in South Korea</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite being as likely to see actual combat as The Fiver is to darken the doorstep of our local drinker this side of June, Son\u2019s spell in the marines is no publicity stunt and, despite his celebrity status, he will have to do more than just a few keepie-uppies on the parade ground for the benefit of the TV cameras. Reports from South Korea state he will be trained in the use of firearms and forced to go on long hikes, two activities everyone he\u2019s left back in London would love to have a go at if only to kill time and get some proper exercise during lockdown.</p> <p>Almost certainly too nice to become a trained killing machine, Son will at least be able to maintain his fitness during national service, all the better to be ready for action if the Premier League starts up again at some point before his retirement. In the meantime, rumours remain unconfirmed that Jos\u00e9 Mourinho continues to inspect Tanguy Ndombele\u2019s family tree in the hope of finding some South Korean heritage that might lead to the midfielder also being conscripted and whipped into some sort of shape.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cWe want it to be known we\u2019re doing something.

The sweat caused by wearing so much plastic is instantaneous and the FFP3 masks irritate the nose and skin. Yet there can be no distractions in critical care, where half of all patients with Covid-19 will not survive.</p> \n<p>(The NHS says it hopes that by allowing a photojournalist to document the care provided in ITU, it may reinforce the need to stay at home and protect the NHS.

  "<p>Rowland S Howard had plans for old age. \u201cWhen I\u2019m 60, there will be feedback coming out of the house and little kids will cross the road when they walk past,\u201d he said. Sadly, Howard\u2019s plan for a screeching house of horrors didn\u2019t come to fruition \u2013 he died of liver cancer in 2009, aged 50.</p> <p>He was the incendiary guitarist in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/nick-cave\">Nick Cave</a>\u2019s pre-Bad Seeds outfit, the Birthday Party, spewing torrents of ear-destroying feedback that ricocheted between swampy blues and industrial terror. He was frequently imitated but never matched. \u201cOur song Don\u2019t Cramp My Style was pure Birthday Party tribute,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/my-bloody-valentine\">My Bloody Valentine</a>\u2019s Kevin Shields. \u201cPeople sue for less nowadays \u2013 it was me doing my best Rowland impersonation. His use of feedback was a huge inspiration. The sound was explosive and silky like channelled electricity.\u201d</p> <p>However, as radical as Howard was, you\u2019re not going to find him among Rolling Stone\u2019s 100 greatest guitarists. After the Birthday Party he didn\u2019t share the same career trajectory as the Bad Seeds. \u201cLike the poet Shelley, it\u2019s shameful these people died poor and relatively anonymous,\u201d says Lindsay Gravina, who produced Howard\u2019s two solo albums, Teenage Snuff Film and Pop Crimes, which are being reissued by Mute, following a recent tribute concert at the Royal Festival Hall in London. \u201cBut people who \u2018get\u2019 him do so the way people get Lou Reed or Bob Dylan.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhNtMok72N4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FhNtMok72N4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Harry Howard, Rowland\u2019s younger brother, recalls him being singular from a young age. \u201cAt 10 he had long hair, wore all black and carried a walking stick.\u201d Such was the strange allure of pre-teen Howard that girls would follow him in the street. \u201cHe was an odd-looking person,\u201d says Mick Harvey of the Birthday Party, Bad Seeds and Crime &amp; the City Solution. \u201cHe was something of a dilettante \u2013 a bit pretentious.\u201d However, once Harvey heard Howard\u2019s teenage band, the Young Charlatans, he realised there was substance behind the lofty demeanour. They poached him for their new wave band, the Boys Next Door, fronted by a teenage Nick Cave. Howard brought the song Shivers, an ironic ballad about teenage-crush hysteria that he wrote when he was 16. It remains the band\u2019s greatest moment.</p> <p>By 1980, the band had become the Birthday Party and together moved to London. They arrived bitterly disappointed. \u201cRowland took London personally,\u201d Cave said in the 2011 documentary, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2015298/\">Autoluminescent</a>. \u201cLike someone had built it to make him unhappy.\u201d The band felt disconnected and were surrounded by bands they felt were banal and insipid. \u201cWe went from being big fish in a small pond to frogspawn in an ocean,\u201d Howard said. Howard and Cave also arrived with heroin habits that exacerbated their bleak situation, one that resulted in Howard suffering from malnutrition while living in a squat.</p> <p>However, the animosity the band felt towards their new home mutated into a vituperative musical intensity, and they were soon a hot ticket. Cave was feral, all guttural screams ringing out above Tracey Pew\u2019s barbaric bass, Harvey\u2019s bone-snapping drum beats and Howard\u2019s feedback orchestra. \u201cWhen it all came together, and the chemicals were at the right balance, the shows were absolutely unbelievable,\u201d says Harvey. \u201cNo video footage,\u201d Gravina says, \u201ccomes remotely close to capturing the sheer terror and excitement of the Birthday Party.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bf827ccf4dea40b20c1666cc57c4e68916cf8531\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf827ccf4dea40b20c1666cc57c4e68916cf8531/0_0_2056_2796/735.jpg\" alt=\"Rowland S Howard.\" width=\"735\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From his elfish and vampiric face dangled a perma-glued cigarette.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Gruchot</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On stage, Howard cut an idiosyncratic figure. From his elfish and vampiric face dangled a perma-glued cigarette as he scuttered around, hammering the tremolo arm of his Fender Jaguar. Cave was aware of Howard\u2019s unique touch \u2013 \u201cAs soon as he played two notes you knew it was him\u201d \u2013 but the Birthday Party was struggling. \u201cIt was so intense and fiery,\u201d says Harvey. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any communication going on, plus people were on drugs, which made things worse.\u201d</p> <p>Howard had been a co-writer in the band, musically and lyrically, but he and Cave began to drift apart. \u201cNick didn\u2019t want to write with him or sing his lyrics any longer, and Rowland felt ostracised,\u201d says Harvey. \u201cIt was a bit of a death knell for the band.\u201d</p> <p>As tensions peaked, Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten\u2019s Blixa Bargeld was brought in to play some guitar on the band\u2019s final recording sessions. \u201cThere was a lot of ill feeling about Blixa being brought in,\u201d says Harvey. \u201cRowland felt rejected.\u201d Cave, Harvey and Bargeld formed the Bad Seeds without Howard. \u201cHe was upset,\u201d says his brother. \u201cIt seemed like everyone carried on without him. He felt the rug had been pulled out from under him. He was at a loss for a while, depressed.\u201d</p> <p>Despite being invited for a couple of guest appearances on Bad Seeds records, Harvey says wounds never truly healed with Cave. \u201cHe had misgivings and resentments about Nick up until the end.\u201d</p> <p>After spending 1985-86 in Crime &amp; the City Solution \u2013 a Gun Club-like fusion of blues, punk and gloomy rock \u2013 Howard formed These Immortal Souls, ostensibly a solo project that merged melancholic melody with jagged post-punk. However, as the 80s became the 90s, thrust for Howard was inverse to his ex-bandmates. \u201cRowland was dismissed by a lot of people after the Birthday Party,\u201d his brother and These Immortal Souls bandmate says. \u201cPeople thought he was old news and washed up. When we finally released our second album, in 1992, it felt like everyone was totally bored by us \u2013 Rowland had become unfashionable. Nick Cave was going from strength to strength, but as he went up Rowland seemed to slide down the other side.\u201d</p> <p>For some, though, Howard remained an unwavering figure. \u201cThe first thing I said to him when I met him was, \u2018I want to fuck you\u2019,\u201d recalls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/bobby-gillespie\">Bobby Gillespie</a> with a hearty laugh. \u201cHe was a guitar hero during a time when there were no guitar heroes.\u201d The singer, poet and no-wave figure <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/10/lydia-lunch-punk-hellraiser-interview-60-so-real-it-hurts-book\">Lydia Lunch</a> collaborated with Howard frequently. \u201cHe was fragile and I always felt he was not for long for this world,\u201d she says. \u201cThat created an urgency in wanting to work with him.\u201d The pair struck up a relationship in the early 80s when Howard accompanied her spoken-word performances with improvised guitar. \u201cMost people want to make as much noise as possible but he understood the economy of sound,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Those who knew him described Howard as obdurate, earnest, sensitive and hopelessly romantic. Although another consistency in his life was heroin. \u201cIt had quite an influence on his creativity,\u201d says his brother. \u201cWhenever he came off heroin he\u2019d get this massive nerve-jangling awakening. A lot of the songs people think are about drugs are actually about stopping taking drugs.\u201d But things never got too desperate, he says. \u201cHe was quite stoic. If he couldn\u2019t get drugs on tour, then he would just suffer quietly. He always maintained this sense of being a gentleman junkie. It never got debauched and he wasn\u2019t stealing. He had a stable life \u2013 it was quite a domestic addiction.\u201d</p> <p>It was 1999 before Howard released another record, Teenage Snuff Film, an album that deftly marries 60s girl-group pop, shimmering cowboy twang guitar and caustically romantic lyrics delivered by Howard\u2019s rich and heroin-free voice. \u201cHe said it would be awful if the Birthday Party was the best thing he\u2019d ever done,\u201d says his brother. \u201cBut he really believed in that album and that it was the best thing he\u2019d ever done.\u201d It was initially met with indifference. \u201cHe was crestfallen,\u201d says Gravina. \u201cIt\u2019s been accorded cult status as a much loved album now, but back then nobody wanted to know.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2051a59925a56c566f49cefb33574b742e43afc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2051a59925a56c566f49cefb33574b742e43afc7/0_0_3000_2003/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonnine Standish of HTRK at the Royal Festival Hall, London, in a tribute to Rowland S Howard in February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonnine Standish of HTRK at the Royal Festival Hall, London, in a tribute to Rowland S Howard in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lorne Thomson/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over time a new generation was growing wise to Howard\u2019s non-Birthday Party output. \u201cI knew every word to Teenage Snuff Film,\u201d says Jonnine Standish of Aussie band HTRK, who Howard went on to produce. \u201cIt was a big influence and we were taken with his mystical reputation as being a bit of a bat.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/14/jehnny-beth-of-savages-sex-is-a-wonderful-way-to-test-yourself\">Jehnny Beth of Savages</a> also regarded him as a revelation. \u201cHe was a huge inspiration for early Savages,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d never heard someone play guitar that way. It was like a sound I\u2019d been waiting all my life to hear \u2013 and lyrically he\u2019s as powerful as Rimbaud.\u201d</p> <p>When Pop Crimes was released in 2009, momentum around Howard had intensified. \u201cThere was a groundswell of interest and it jolted him into action,\u201d Harvey recalls, as does his brother. \u201cHe was so ready for it. He was really sick but he thought he was going to get out of the hospital.\u201d However, it was all too late.

In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration \u2013 which has triggered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/17/trump-liberate-tweets-coronavirus-stay-at-home-orders\">protests in the US</a> and elsewhere \u2013 and the urgent need to reopen economies.</p> \n<p>The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.</p> \n<p>In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-we-have-one\">a vaccine still months away</a>, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.</p> \n<p>As Justin Lessler, an associate professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University, wrote strikingly for the Washington Post in March: \u201cEpidemics are like fires. When fuel is plentiful, they rage uncontrollably, and when it is scarce, they smoulder slowly.</p> \n<p>\u201cEpidemiologists call this intensity the \u2018force of infection\u2019, and the fuel that drives it is the population\u2019s susceptibility to the pathogen. As repeated waves of the epidemic reduce susceptibility (whether through complete or partial immunity), they also reduce the force of infection, lowering the risk of illness even among those with no immunity.\u201d</p> \n<p>The problem is that we do not know how much fuel is still available for the virus.</p>",
  "<p>The modern world has been shaped by the belief that humans can outsmart and defeat death. That was a revolutionary new attitude. For most of history, humans meekly submitted to death. Up to the late modern age, most religions and ideologies saw death not only as our inevitable fate, but as the main source of meaning in life. The most important events of human existence happened after you exhaled your last breath. Only then did you come to learn the true secrets of life. Only then did you gain eternal salvation, or suffer everlasting damnation. In a world without death \u2013 and therefore without heaven, hell or reincarnation \u2013 religions such as Christianity, Islam and Hinduism would have made no sense. For most of history the best human minds were busy giving meaning to death, not trying to defeat it.</p> <p><em>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/mar/08/featuresreviews.guardianreview26\">Epic of Gilgamesh</a></em>, the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, the Bible, the Qur\u2019an, the Vedas, and countless other sacred books and tales patiently explained to distressed humans that we die because God decreed it, or the Cosmos, or Mother Nature, and we had better accept that destiny with humility and grace. Perhaps someday God would abolish death through a grand metaphysical gesture such as Christ\u2019s second coming. But orchestrating such cataclysms was clearly above the pay grade of flesh-and-blood humans.</p> <p>Then came the scientific revolution. For scientists, death isn\u2019t a divine decree \u2013 it is merely a technical problem. Humans die not because God said so, but because of some technical glitch. The heart stops pumping blood. Cancer has destroyed the liver. Viruses multiply in the lungs. And what is responsible for all these technical problems? Other technical problems. The heart stops pumping blood because not enough oxygen reaches the heart muscle. Cancerous cells spread in the liver because of some chance genetic mutation. Viruses settled in my lungs because somebody sneezed on the bus. Nothing metaphysical about it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3419a4521af00f4d50c8cde129de9970d8b85d81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3419a4521af00f4d50c8cde129de9970d8b85d81/0_138_3888_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Coleman from Dublin at Knock Shrine, Co Mayo, May 2010, when he claimed that an Apparation would take place, directly linked to the second coming of Christ on Earth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Coleman from Dublin at Knock Shrine, Co Mayo, May 2010, when he claimed that an apparition would take place, directly linked to the second coming of Christ on Earth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julien Behal/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And science believes that every technical problem has a technical solution. We don\u2019t need to wait for Christ\u2019s second coming in order to overcome death. A couple of scientists in a lab can do it. Whereas traditionally death was the speciality of priests and theologians in black cassocks, now it\u2019s the folks in white lab coats. If the heart flutters, we can stimulate it with a pacemaker or even transplant a new heart. If cancer rampages, we can kill it with radiation. If viruses proliferate in the lungs, we can subdue them with some new medicine.</p> <p>True, at present we cannot solve all technical problems. But we are working on them. The best human minds no longer spend their time trying to give meaning to death. Instead, they are busy extending life. They are investigating the microbiological, physiological and genetic systems responsible for disease and old age, and developing new medicines and revolutionary treatments.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>In their struggle to extend life, humans have been remarkably successful. Over the last two centuries, average life expectancy has jumped from under 40 years to 72 in the entire world, and to more than 80 in some developed countries. Children in particular have succeeded in escaping death\u2019s clutches. Until the 20th century, at least a third of children never reached adulthood. Youngsters routinely succumbed to childhood diseases such as dysentery, measles and smallpox. In 17th-century England, about 150 out of every 1,000 newborns died during their first year, and only about 700 made it to age 15. Today, only five out of 1,000 English babies die during their first year, and 993 get to celebrate their 15th birthday. In the world as a whole, child mortality is down to less than 5%.</p> <p>Humans have been so successful in our attempt to safeguard and prolong life that our worldview has changed in a profound way. While traditional religions considered the afterlife as the main source of meaning, from the 18th century ideologies such as liberalism, socialism and feminism lost all interest in the afterlife. What, exactly, happens to a communist after he or she dies? What happens to a capitalist? What happens to a feminist? It is pointless to look for the answer in the writings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/karl-marx\">Karl Marx</a>, Adam Smith or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/simonedebeauvoir\">Simone de Beauvoir</a>.</p> <p>The only modern ideology that still awards death a central role is nationalism. In its more poetic and desperate moments, nationalism promises that whoever dies for the nation will live forever in its collective memory. Yet this promise is so fuzzy that even most nationalists do not really know what to make of it. How do you actually \u201clive\u201d in memory? If you are dead, how do you know whether people remember you or not? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/09/apropos-of-nothing-by-woody-allen-review-a-life-and-an-accusation\">Woody Allen</a> was once asked if he hoped to live for ever in the memory of moviegoers. Allen answered: \u201cI\u2019d rather live on in my apartment.\u201d Even many traditional religions have switched focus. Instead of promising some heaven in the afterlife, they have begun to put far more emphasis on what they can do for you in this life.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The only modern ideology that still awards death a central role is nationalism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Will the current pandemic change human attitudes to death? Probably not. Just the opposite. Covid-19 will probably cause us to only double our efforts to protect human lives. For the dominant cultural reaction to Covid-19 isn\u2019t resignation \u2013 it is a mixture of outrage and hope.</p> <p>When an epidemic erupted in a pre-modern society such as medieval Europe, people of course feared for their lives and were devastated by the death of loved ones, but the main cultural reaction was one of resignation. Psychologists might call it \u201clearned helplessness\u201d. People told themselves it was God\u2019s will \u2013 or perhaps divine retribution for the sins of humankind. \u201cGod knows best. We wicked humans deserve it. And you will see, it will all turn out for the best in the end. Don\u2019t worry, good people will get their reward in heaven. And don\u2019t waste time looking for a medicine. This disease was sent by God to punish us. Those who think humans can overcome this epidemic by their own ingenuity are merely adding the sin of vanity to their other crimes. Who are we to thwart God\u2019s plans?\u201d</p> <p>Attitudes today are the polar opposite. Whenever some disaster kills many people \u2013 a train accident, a high-rise fire, even a hurricane \u2013 we tend to view it as a preventable human failure rather than as divine punishment or an inevitable natural calamity. If the train company didn\u2019t stint on its safety budget, if the municipality had adopted better fire regulations, and if the government had sent help quicker \u2013 these people could have been saved. In the 21st century, mass death has become an automatic reason for lawsuits and investigations. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2bb98b7954e8b3620a278da1948349aca092dd8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bb98b7954e8b3620a278da1948349aca092dd8d/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Port Vila, Vanuatu, after Cyclone Pam struck in March 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Port Vila, Vanuatu, after Cyclone Pam struck in March 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Hunt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is our attitude towards plagues, too. While some religious preachers were quick to describe Aids as God\u2019s punishment for gay people, modern society mercifully relegated such views to its lunatic fringes, and these days we generally view the spread of Aids, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/15/ebola-in-the-drc-everything-you-need-to-know\">Ebola and other recent epidemics</a> as organisational failures. We assume that humankind has the knowledge and tools necessary to curb such plagues, and if an infectious disease nevertheless gets out of control, it is due to human incompetence rather than divine anger. Covid-19 is no exception to this rule. The crisis is far from over, yet the blame game has already begun. Different countries accuse one another. Rival politicians throw responsibility from one to the other like a hand-grenade without a pin. </p> <p>Alongside outrage, there is also a tremendous amount of hope. Our heroes aren\u2019t the priests who bury the dead and excuse the calamity \u2013 our heroes are the medics who save lives. And our super-heroes are those scientists in the laboratories. Just as moviegoers know that Spiderman and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/05/why-wonder-woman-is-a-masterpiece-of-subversive-feminism\">Wonder Woman </a>will eventually defeat the bad guys and save the world, so we are quite sure that within a few months, perhaps a year, the folks in the labs will come up with effective treatments for Covid-19 and even a vaccination. Then we\u2019ll show this nasty coronavirus who is the alpha organism on this planet! The question on the lips of everybody from the White House, through Wall Street all the way to the balconies of Italy is: \u201cWhen will the vaccine be ready?\u201d When. Not if.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>When the vaccine is indeed ready and the pandemic is over, what will be humanity\u2019s main takeaway? In all likelihood, it will be that we need to invest even more efforts in protecting human lives. We need to have more hospitals, more doctors, more nurses. We need to stockpile more respiratory machines, more protective gear, more testing kits. We need to invest more money in researching unknown pathogens and developing novel treatments. We should not be caught off guard again.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The crisis is far from over yet the blame game has already begun. Politicians throw responsibility from one to the other</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some might well argue that this is the wrong lesson, and that the crisis should teach us humility. We shouldn\u2019t be so sure of our ability to subdue the forces of nature. Many of these naysayers are medieval holdouts, who preach humility while being 100% certain that they know all the right answers. Some bigots cannot help themselves \u2013 a pastor who leads weekly Bible study for Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet has argued that this epidemic too is divine punishment for homosexuality. But even most paragons of tradition nowadays put their trust in science rather than in scripture.</p> <p>The Catholic church instructs the faithful to stay away from the churches. Israel has closed down its synagogues. The Islamic Republic of Iran is discouraging people from visiting mosques. Temples and sects of all kinds have suspended public ceremonies. And all because scientists have made calculations, and recommended closing down these holy places.</p> <p>Of course, not everyone who warns us about human hubris dreams of getting medieval. Even scientists would agree that we should be realistic in our expectations, and that we shouldn\u2019t develop blind faith in the power of doctors to shield us from all of life\u2019s calamities. While humanity as a whole becomes ever more powerful, individual people still need to face their fragility. Perhaps in a century or two science will extend human lives indefinitely, but not yet. With the possible exception of a handful of billionaire babies, all of us today are going to die one day, and all of us will lose loved ones. We have to own up to our transience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e6e6c0793edd490882f2a6e3ca927d134bde247\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e6e6c0793edd490882f2a6e3ca927d134bde247/0_0_4500_2701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An empty mosque in Shahr-e-Ray, south of Tehran, on a Friday in March 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An empty mosque in Shahr-e-Ray, south of Tehran, on a Friday in March 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ebrahim Noroozi/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For centuries, people used religion as a defence mechanism, believing that they would exist for ever in the afterlife. Now people sometimes switch to using science as an alternative defence mechanism, believing that doctors will always save them, and that they will live for ever in their apartment. We need a balanced approach here. We should trust science to deal with epidemics, but we should still shoulder the burden of dealing with our individual mortality and transience.</p> <p>The present crisis might indeed make many individuals more aware of the impermanent nature of human life and human achievements. Nevertheless, our modern civilisation as a whole will most probably go in the opposite direction. Reminded of its fragility, it will react by building stronger defences. When the present crisis is over, I don\u2019t expect we will see a significant increase in the budgets of philosophy departments. But I bet we will see a massive increase in the budgets of medical schools and healthcare systems.</p> <p>And maybe that is the best we can humanly expect. Governments anyhow aren\u2019t very good at philosophy. It isn\u2019t their domain. Governments really should focus on building better healthcare systems. It is up to individuals to do better philosophy. Doctors cannot solve the riddle of existence for us. But they can buy us some more time to grapple with it. What we do with that time is up to us.</p>",

  "<p>When Bill Frankland began practising in the 1940s, allergy medicine was barely a discipline. The allergist <a href=\"https://www.allergylondon.com/team/dr-adam-fox/\">Adam Fox</a> said: \u201cTo say Bill Frankland was the grandfather of allergy medicine doesn\u2019t do it justice. He wasn\u2019t the grandfather in the sense of being the oldest but in the sense of being the originator of the speciality. He did the original trials and founded the British society. He was still practising in his 90s and 100s, and remained the doctor people wanted to see.\u201d</p> <p>On his release from a Japanese prisoner of war camp in 1945, Frankland, who has died aged 108, returned to St Mary\u2019s hospital, Paddington, in London, where he had trained. He had suffered with hay fever since he was nine, and when he saw an advertisement for a part-time assistant in the allergy department, he applied. In February 1946 he became full-time and for the next 70 years was gripped by allergy medicine, which he said was like a fascinating detective story.</p> <p>Frankland worked at the allergy clinic at St Mary\u2019s hospital for more than 30 years, and was its director from 1958 until he retired in 1977. A few years later it was renamed the <a href=\"https://www.bsaci.org/find-a-clinic-1/st-marys-hospital-3\">Frankland Allergy Clinic</a>. It was the busiest in the country, and it is estimated that Frankland oversaw the desensitisation treatment of around 30,000 hay fever patients. At the same time, he also ran the hospital\u2019s pollen farm near Woking, Surrey, until it closed in 1970.</p> <p>In 1948 the British Association of Allergists was formed with 30 members and Frankland as its secretary. It grew rapidly as it widened its scope to include immunology, becoming the <a href=\"https://www.bsaci.org/\">British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology</a> (BSACI) in 1973. Frankland was its president from 1963 to 1966 and remained at its heart all his life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8f198624b6a493f1955e05fd47080a88979095ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f198624b6a493f1955e05fd47080a88979095ef/0_0_2321_3500/663.jpg\" alt=\"William Frankland with his MBE for services to allergy research, which he was awarded in 2015\" width=\"663\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">William Frankland with his MBE for services to allergy research, which he was awarded in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Stillwell/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When he began his career in the late 1940s antihistamines had recently come on stream to treat allergies. Frankland was involved in several trials, demonstrating that two antihistamines reduced hay fever symptoms but were not effective for asthma.</p> <p>Allergen desensitisation for hay fever had been used since 1911, but had not been properly evaluated. Frankland had read about double-blind placebo-controlled trials and wanted to apply them to his discipline. Patients at that time were injected with a grass-pollen extract called Pollaccine to desensitise them.</p> <p>Frankland was concerned that it contained material that gave unwanted side-effects and wanted to determine exactly which part of the pollen extract was effective. In 1953 he recruited 200 hay fever patients and showed that a purified pollen protein worked just as well as Pollaccine. His paper, published in 1954, was a milestone: the first double-blind randomised clinical trial in immunotherapy; 65 years later, Frankland was gratified to see it celebrated on the 2018 cover of the journal Allergy.</p> <p>In the 40s and 50s it was difficult for hay fever patients to control their symptoms without information on what type of pollen and how much of it was in the air. Frankland knew that atmospheric levels of pollen were being measured in Cardiff and wanted to do the same in London. In 1953 he installed a <a href=\"https://hekint.org/2019/05/20/grandfather-of-allergy-dr-bill-frankland-the-ardent-centenarian/\">Hirst </a><a href=\"https://hekint.org/2019/05/20/grandfather-of-allergy-dr-bill-frankland-the-ardent-centenarian/\">spore </a><a href=\"https://hekint.org/2019/05/20/grandfather-of-allergy-dr-bill-frankland-the-ardent-centenarian/\">trap</a> on the roof of the nurses\u2019 home at St Mary\u2019s and recruited a biologist (whose name he was amused to recount was Miss Hay) to provide daily pollen counts and analyse the prevalence of different pollens. Initially the information went out once a week to members of the British Association of Allergists, but, to disseminate it further, in 1963 Frankland persuaded the Times and the Daily Telegraph to print a daily pollen count. (It is now part of the weather forecast and coordinated by the Met Office.)</p> <p>As well as his other duties at St Mary\u2019s, in the 40s Frankland spent two years as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/mar/12/penicillin-fleming-alexander-bacteriology\">Sir Alexander Fleming</a>\u2019s clinical assistant. He took care of Fleming\u2019s patients, reporting on their progress every morning at 10am even though Fleming preferred to discuss other subjects.</p> <p>Frankland said: \u201cHe just wasn\u2019t interested in clinical medicine \u2013 once he looked down a microscope, he continued looking down a microscope\u201d</p> <p>In 1948 the publisher Butterworths asked for a new chapter on sensitivities in Fleming\u2019s bestseller Penicillin: Its Practical Application, and Fleming tasked Frankland with writing it. Fleming himself did not accept that people could be allergic to penicillin, saying adverse reactions must be the result of drug impurities. When he read Frankland\u2019s draft, he crossed out the last sentence: \u201cWith the increasing use of penicillin, it is to be expected that allergic reactions will become more common,\u201d substituting: \u201cWith the increasing use of penicillin, reactions due to impurities will become less common.\u201d Frankland disagreed, but did not feel he should argue with the Nobel prize winner.</p> <p>In his long career Frankland treated many patients including, in 1979, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/dec/30/iraq.guardianobituaries\">Saddam Hussein</a>, whose symptoms were caused by cigarettes rather than asthma. He told him: \u201cIf you\u2019re not eating, sleeping or praying, you\u2019re smoking. If you carry on, you won\u2019t be president in two years\u2019 time.\u201d Saddam heeded the advice and later flew Frankland out to Baghdad for a celebratory lunch.</p> <p>As well as asthma and hay fever, Frankland was interested in many different allergies, and, in the now no longer permissible tradition of self-experimentation, in 1955 allowed the South American insect <em>Rhodnius prolixus</em> to bite him weekly so he could observe the reaction. He got the insect from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and kept it in the glove compartment of his car. After eight weeks, he had a severe anaphylactic reaction and was saved by two injections of adrenaline. Three hours later, he helped a nurse push her car. The strenuous exercise brought on anaphylaxis again, requiring a third shot of adrenaline. This experience led to his interest in the delay that is possible in allergic reactions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"61995850e0c2522a68dc49e5f59f897a87a427a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61995850e0c2522a68dc49e5f59f897a87a427a1/0_94_1380_1723/801.jpg\" alt=\"William Frankland, drawn by Gideon Summerfield\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">William Frankland had been a Japanese PoW in the second world war, but was not able to talk of his experiences until he was nearly 100.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Gideon Summerfield</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Frankland was born near Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex. His father, Henry, was a vicar and his mother, Rose (nee West), a musician. He was an identical twin and nearly didn\u2019t survive because he was born prematurely and was tiny, weighing just over 3lb (1.4kg). The family moved to Cumberland (now Cumbria), in north-west England, and Frankland remembered getting postcards from his father who was away during the first world war.</p> <p>When he was nine he caught tuberculosis, and was unimpressed with the doctor treating him, deciding he could do a better job and should study medicine. He went to St Bees school in the county and then to Queen\u2019s College, Oxford, to study natural sciences. His studies were interrupted for six months when he returned home to care for his elder sister Ella, who had scarlet fever. She died in October 1933 and he returned to Oxford before moving to St Mary\u2019s hospital, qualifying as a doctor in 1938.</p> <p>Two days before the second world war was declared in September 1939, Frankland volunteered as a civilian medical practitioner in the army. He was shipped out to Singapore, where his life was saved a second time. \u201cAnother doctor and I decided to spin a coin to determine our assignments,\u201d he said. \u201cI called heads and won. The man who lost went to [the] Alexandra hospital where he was brutally murdered by Japanese forces in 1942.\u201d</p> <p>Frankland, however, was captured and became a Japanese PoW. In 1943 he was moved to Pulau Blakang Mati (now Sentosa Island), off Singapore\u2019s southern coast, where his two days of tropical medicine training were scant preparation for the array of malnutrition, malaria, dengue and beri-beri he faced. He was nearly bayoneted to death during a punishment \u201cbashing\u201d from Japanese soldiers, and his life was saved yet again when the Americans dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, ending the war and preventing mass shooting of PoWs.</p> <p>Frankland returned home in October of that year. He had married Pauline Jackson, an optometrist, in 1941, and had treasured her letters. When he arrived in Liverpool, he was asked if he wanted to see a psychiatrist and replied: \u201cNo. I want to see my wife.\u201d</p> <p>Frankland decided not to talk about his experiences to Pauline or to his family. He said: \u201cWhen I got back, I thought I\u2019m alive and this is marvellous. I\u2019m going to forget everything I\u2019ve gone through.\u201d When he was nearly 100, he told a colleague he watched a TV programme about VE Day and had his first flashback. Thereafter he was amenable to talking about his experiences.</p> <p>When Frankland left St Mary\u2019s in 1977, he became an honorary consultant at Guy\u2019s hospital in London, where he saw patients into his 90s. He also worked as an expert witness in court cases, and continued to write papers and attend conferences. Each year he presented the <a href=\"https://www.bsaci.org/about/william-frankland-award-winners\">BSACI William Frankland </a><a href=\"https://www.bsaci.org/about/william-frankland-award-winners\">award</a>. He had a wide circle of friends and a great zest for life, remembered by one colleague as enjoying tea at the Ritz and riding a dodgem car aged 103.</p> <p>Pauline died in 2002, and two years ago Frankland moved from his flat in Marylebone to accommodation in <a href=\"http://www.thecharterhouse.org/\">the Charterhouse, central London</a>. When asked about his life, Frankland said: \u201cI have been very lucky.\u201d</p> <p>He is survived by two sons and two daughters, 10 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.</p> <p>\u2022 Alfred William Frankland, immunologist, born 19 March 1912; died 2 April 2020</p> <p><br></p>",

Kaine says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The airline has two decades of providing decent jobs, a safe working environment and excellent service for the travelling public. It is a viable and much needed business and without it Australia will struggle to get its economy back on track once the crisis abates. There is still time for the federal government to work on an investment plan to get through this period of crisis and taxpayers will get a double benefit. </p> \n   <p>The government will retain a competitive aviation market and they will get a return on their equity stake.</p> \n   <p>The prime minister has promoted the concept of hibernation, of keeping viable businesses afloat through this crisis. That must include Virgin and the only way to do that is a government equity stake in this business.</p> \n   <p>Countries around the world have recognised the extraordinary circumstances that the aviation is in and where they have stepped in and saved jobs. If the federal government does not move to save Virgin the prime minister must explain why Virgin workers don\u2019t matter? Why don\u2019t their families who depend on them matter?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The union said it had urged the Victorian, NSW and Federal Governments to financially assist Virgin, following a pledge by the Queensland Premier for $200m aid for the airline.</p> \n  <p>A letter from the union read:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>While all of Australia is experiencing the stresses of altered life, with many people stood down from their jobs, the anxiety among Virgin staff is heightened given the airline\u2019s difficulties and the fact that they worsen in a very public way on a daily basis. </p> \n   <p>We ask that you consider these workers and to examine your state\u2019s capacity to give them and their families the certainty they need about their future. We believe it is also in the interest of the travelling public that Virgin remains a viable airline to ensure an efficient, reliable service right across Australia. A monopoly by one airline after this crisis ends will hamper the nation\u2019s ability to restart and get back to where it was.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T09:39:05.446Z\">at 10.39am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9d62bc8f08bade1f29661f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/ben-butler\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T08:54:47.691Z\">9.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Paul Scurrah is to keep his job as chief executive of Virgin Australia, at least for the short term, when insolvency practitioners from Deloitte are appointed as administrators, Guardian Australia understands.</p> \n  <p>The shape of the administration, which has yet to be confirmed by Virgin Australia, is still far from clear.</p> \n  <p>But as we\u2019ve previously reported at least one bidder, BGH Capital, thinks something can be salvaged from the collapse.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78e6ba6d025fe4102485b72e9406ebfd367d9034\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78e6ba6d025fe4102485b72e9406ebfd367d9034/414_37_4132_2479/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Virgin Australia CEO Paul Scurrah addressing shareholders in November 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Virgin Australia CEO Paul Scurrah addressing shareholders in November 2019.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Peled/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9d5fa28f080ee110448124\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T08:43:38.549Z\">9.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Aussie stocks plunge in worst loss for three weeks</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Australian stocks had their worst loss in three weeks.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pain out there today,\u201d CMC Markets chief market strategist Michael McCarthy told AAP.</p> \n  <p>The S&amp;P/ASX200 benchmark index finished Monday down 134.5 points, or 2.45%, to 5,353 points, while the All Ordinaries index was closed down 130 points, or 2.34 %, to 5,414.</p> \n  <p>AAP reports the plunge wiped out last week\u2019s gains and was the ASX200\u2019s worst loss since a 5.3% drop on March 27.</p> \n  <p>US oil benchmark was smashed to its lowest level since 1999, hitting energy stocks.

support\u201d in the future. </p> \n  <p>Goldie welcomed the temporary boost to welfare payments, but said: \u201c... we can never go back to the low rate of the old Newstart payment of just $40 a day or the punitive approaches that punished and demonised people locked out of paid work.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>This included what <strong>Acoss</strong> considered past approaches such as \u201cdenying payments to people with a small amount of savings, or imposing Work for the Dole and unrealistic job search requirements; the government should meet its own obligations to secure employment for people\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe need to raise the rate for good so those without paid work can cover the basics \u2013 food, housing, electricity \u2013 and they can make the most of job opportunities as the economy rebuilds,\u201d she said. </p> \n  <p>Acoss also wants an expansion in infrastructure investment, such as social housing and improvements in the energy efficiency of homes, to restore growth in employment as the lockdowns are eased. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWe need to fix our employment services system to create pathways to jobs for people who are unemployed long term and those at greatest risk, including people leaving education without Year 12 qualifications, older people, people with disability and people with caring responsibilities,\u201d she said. </p> \n

The government though says it wants at least 40% of Australians to download the app to make it successful.

The 20-year pilot showed that online inspectors in HIMP young chicken establishments were able to conduct an effective online inspection of each carcass when operating at a line speed of up to 175 bpm and that HIMP establishments were able to control for pathogens at the line speeds authorized under HIMP.\u201d</p> <p>Increased line speeds are supported by the poultry industry, which argues they do not represent additional risk to food or workers safety, and are necessary to remain financially competitive. Three years ago the National Chicken Council <a href=\"https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/7734f5cf-05d9-4f89-a7eb-6d85037ad2a7/17-05-Petition-National-Chicken-Council-09012017.pdf?MOD=AJPERES\">lobbied</a> the government to scrap line speed limits completely, calling them \u201carbitrary\u201d.</p> <p>Under traditional poultry processing rules, line speeds ran at 140 birds a minute, and required at least four inspectors to be stationed on each line, tasked with checking carcasses for defects, disease or contamination, including fecal matter which can cause salmonella. That has since been reduced to one inspector per line, with <a href=\"https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/5bd6c2c0-5e37-4397-9ed4-2468c2168557/2018-0014.htm?MOD=AJPERES\">individual regulatory waivers</a> enabling line speed increases.<br><br>\u201cIt potentially reduces some of the quality control efforts, but I am not concerned about worker safety as a result of the increased line speeds.

People are getting sick from our poultry production system, and we think that is a public health emergency.\u201d</p> <p>The FSIS has made attempts to bring down salmonella levels and reduce food-borne illness. The FSIS pointed out to the Guardian that the number of establishments in category three [it has a rating system to encourage improvement] has been halved since 2017. But a Guardian analysis of the FSIS\u2019s reports for the last year shows that for chicken carcass plants, an average 11.8% of inspected plants still failed the standard. </p> <p> </p> <p>In 2011, when the FSIS <a href=\"https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/65602d92-d017-4edc-8536-5ed6aaa6b52a/Strategic_Plan_2011-2016.pdf?MOD=AJPERES\">set a target</a> to reduce food-borne illness, the incidence level for salmonella was estimated at around 16.4 people per 100,000. The FSIS\u2019s plan aimed to reduce that number to 11.4 by this year, but instead, after a small decline over five years, it has now risen to 18.3, according to a CDC spokesperson.</p> <p>Outbreak numbers are rising too.

Meanwhile a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/pdf/threats-report/2019-ar-threats-report-508.pdf\">report by the CDC</a> highlighted the rise in antibiotic-resistant salmonella as a serious threat that requires \u201cprompt and sustained action\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3499d4a0fac7eb83ab0c9c0c43f6537746e4331\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3499d4a0fac7eb83ab0c9c0c43f6537746e4331/0_127_3528_2117/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers process chickens at a plant in Fremont, US\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Poultry plants have been given permission to speed up production lines despite warnings that it could compromise food safety.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nati Harnik/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A spokesperson for the Chicken Council disagreed with criticisms of the sector. He told the Guardian: \u201cNo one wants to reduce salmonella more than the companies producing our food. Our families eat the same chicken.\u201d The council opposes the petition, he stated. \u201cWe agree with FSIS, and previous court rulings, that a science-based, multitiered approach aimed at reducing all salmonella on raw meat and poultry products results in a more appropriate and effective use of agency resources compared to a separate and specific focus on specific individual strains.\u201d</p> <p>Campaigners say the FSIS is limited in its ability to keep US meat and poultry healthy.

This sari will be shared, so my nieces and children, inshallah, will also wear it.

I played in it as a child, chatted with friends in the mountains wearing it and romanced on the beach.

  "<p>Priti Patel is facing legal action under whistleblowing laws after her former permanent secretary Sir Philip Rutnam lodged an employment tribunal claim on Monday saying he was forced from his job for exposing her bullying behaviour.</p> <p>Rutnam claims he was constructively dismissed from his role as Home Office permanent secretary after informing the Cabinet Office that Patel had belittled officials in meetings and made unreasonable demands on staff.</p> <p>The development will increase pressure on Patel, who has denied claims that she bullied civil servants in three government departments, and on Boris Johnson, who has publicly backed his home secretary. She is also the subject of a Cabinet Office inquiry into her behaviour.</p> <p>It is the first time that Rutnam has said he will make a claim of \u201cprotected disclosure\u201d under whistleblowing laws and the first time that a secretary of state has been sued by a former permanent secretary.</p> <p>Another consequence of a whistleblowing claim means that instead of a ceiling of \u00a385,000 on Rutnam\u2019s claim, there will be no upper limit to any damages he might receive.</p> <p>Announcing the start of the legal action, the general secretary of the civil service union the FDA, Dave Penman, told the Guardian: \u201cThis morning Sir Philip, with the support of his legal team and the FDA, submitted a claim to the employment tribunal for constructive dismissal and whistleblowing against the home secretary. Sir Philip will not be making any further comment at this time.\u201d</p> <p>Rutnam\u2019s claim is expected to focus on Patel\u2019s treatment of senior civil servants in the Home Office. According to reports, a senior Home Office official collapsed after a fractious meeting with Patel. Patel is understood to have successfully asked for another senior official in the department to be moved from their job.</p> <p>Rutnam subsequently wrote to all senior civil servants in the department highlighting the dangers of workplace stress. He also made clear that they could not be expected to do unrealistic work outside office hours.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f76d86c816ac6a4cfac215c4eed14b5a8e4ad56f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f76d86c816ac6a4cfac215c4eed14b5a8e4ad56f/0_0_2890_1734/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Philip Rutman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Philip Rutman addressing the home affairs select committee in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After a report in the Times highlighted tensions between Rutnam and Patel, sources close to Patel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/01/priti-patel-bullying-row-explosive-briefings-that-may-resurface-in-rutnam-legal-case\">were quoted in several newspapers</a> as saying that Rutnam should resign. An article in the Times said he should be stripped of his pension, another in the Telegraph said he was nicknamed Dr No for negative ideas, while one in the Sun compared him to Eeyore.</p> <p>At that time the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said Johnson had full confidence in the home secretary and in the civil service, though the same guarantee was not given to Rutnam specifically.</p> <p>Rutnam resigned on 29 February, reading a hastily arranged statement outside his home. In the statement, he accused Patel of orchestrating a \u201cvicious\u201d campaign against him, of lying about her involvement in it and of creating a climate of fear in her department.</p> <p>Rutnam is expected to be represented by Gavin Mansfield QC, the head of Littleton Chambers and an employment law specialist. He will be supported by Clive Howard from the law firm Slater &amp; Gordon.</p> <p>Patel would be expected to appear as a witness, along with her special advisers, and the government would be asked for full disclosure of emails and correspondence between Patel, her staff, the Cabinet Office and No 10. </p> <p>Bruce Carr, a leading QC and former government adviser on employment legislation, said the significance of a whistleblowing claim was that the compensation would be uncapped, unlike an ordinary unfair dismissal claim.</p> <p>\u201cRutnam will have to show that he made a \u2018protected disclosure\u2019 \u2013 such as a disclosure of information showing there has been a breach of a legal obligation. This could include an allegation that others had been bullied, which would amount to a breach of their contract of employment. It could also include an allegation that a minister had breached the ministerial code,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The ministerial code states: \u201cThere must be no bullying and no harassment.\u201d</p> <p>A Cabinet Office inquiry into the allegations of bullying and Rutnam\u2019s resignation is being carried out by Sir Alex Allan, the prime minister\u2019s independent adviser on ministers\u2019 interests. He will decide whether Patel broke any rules. However, the final say rests with Johnson, who can overrule Allan and keep his findings secret.</p> <p>Despite holding one of the four great offices of state during a national pandemic, Patel has rarely been seen in public since the allegations of bullying emerged in February. She has made one appearance at the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/11/priti-patel-says-sorry-if-people-feel-there-have-been-failings-over-ppe\">was criticised</a> after saying she was sorry if people felt there had been a failure to supply sufficient personal protective equipment to NHS staff.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said:<strong> \u201c</strong>We do not comment on ongoing legal proceedings.\u201d Patel\u2019s office has been approached for a comment.</p>",
  "<p>Prince Harry pleaded with his then future father-in-law, Thomas Markle, to stop talking to the newspapers and blamed the media for the collapse of Markle\u2019s relationship with the royal couple, according to a series of text messages sent on the eve of the Harry\u2019s wedding to Meghan Markle.</p> <p>The messages, revealed in court documents filed at the high court on Monday, show Harry repeatedly tried to make contact in the days before the televised royal wedding in May 2018. Thomas Markle, who lives in Mexico, had been expected to walk his daughter down the aisle in the ceremony at Windsor Palace, and was revealed by the Mail on Sunday to have helped stage paparazzi pictures of himself preparing for the wedding.</p> <p>In one text, Harry attempted to rescue the situation before the wedding. \u201cTom, Harry again!

Meghan learned about her father\u2019s hospitalisation, just days before her wedding, from the TMZ report.</p> <p>Meghan later messaged her father in hospital to offer her support. \u201cI\u2019ve been reaching out to you all weekend but you\u2019re not taking any of our calls or replying to any texts \u2026 Very concerned about your health and safety and have taken every measure to protect you but not sure what more we can do if you don\u2019t respond \u2026 Do you need help? Can we send the security team down again? I\u2019m very sorry to hear you\u2019re in the hospital but need you to please get in touch with us \u2026 What hospital are you at?\u201d</p> <p>After Markle refused the offer of security guards to protect him from press intrusion, the court documents say Meghan messaged him again. \u201cHarry and I made a decision earlier today and are dispatching the same security guys you turned away this weekend to be a presence on the ground to make sure you\u2019re safe \u2026 they will be there at your disposal as soon as you need them. Please please call as soon as you can .. all of this is incredibly concerning but your health is most important.\u201d</p> <p>In the court filing, Meghan said the last contact she received from her father was a missed call at 4.57am on 19 May 2018, the morning of the wedding, and they had not been in contact since except through letter correspondence.</p> <p>The Duchess of Sussex is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/01/meghan-sues-mail-on-sunday-for-publishing-letter-to-her-father\">suing the publisher of the Mail on Sunday</a> for alleged invasion of privacy, breach of copyright and misuse of personal data after it published excerpts from a letter she subsequently sent to her father complaining about his treatment of her.</p> <p>The Mail on Sunday argues that as a member of the royal family she did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy and that there was no agreement with her father that the letter should remain private.</p> <p>In her legal response, Meghan said the publisher of the Mail had sought to \u201cattack and intimidate her\u201d. She said she had no idea that five of her close friends had chosen to collectively cooperate with the US magazine People on a lengthy piece regarding her relationship with her father, which included references to the letter. The Mail on Sunday has previously suggested they were operating with the approval of Meghan, arguing that that meant her father had a legitimate right to reply to claims about the letter.</p> <p>Meghan\u2019s lawyers also suggest Thomas Markle claimed to have been hoodwinked into a nine-hour interview with a Mail on Sunday reporter in July 2018. Markle told his daughter in a letter: \u201cHe [the reporter] said a few things I said in confidence, but 85% were lies and bullshit! I called him and told him he was a thief, a liar and a coward and I would GET EVEN! ... I didn\u2019t want or intend to give him an interview and I certainly would not do nine hours for free!\u201d</p> <p>The paperwork was submitted to the high court on Friday, shortly before the couple sent a letter to the editors of Britain\u2019s tabloid newspapers stating that they would now adopt a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/20/harry-and-meghan-uk-tabloids-duke-duchess-sussex-sun-daily-mail\">policy of \u201czero engagement\u201d</a> with them. The pair quit their royal duties at the start of the month and recently moved to California, with Meghan voicing a Disney+ programme about elephants. </p> <p>Prince Harry is separately bringing a case against the parent companies of the Sun and the Mirror for alleged historical phone-hacking offences.</p> <p>The hearing relating to the Mail on Sunday case will take place by video conference on Friday.</p>",
  "<p><em>As lockdown continues, Guardian Opinion is reviving its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/a-book-that-changed-me\">A book that changed me</a> series, an opportunity for writers to select the very best reading to help get us through these uncertain times, with a new instalment every Monday.</em></p> <p>The list of questions an author is asked inevitably includes which books most influenced them. Though they may start by trying to give an honest answer, writers ultimately treat it as a joke or lapse into endless speculation. We also come to realise that the answers we provide are far from objective or consistent, depending largely on when the question arises, on our age and sincerity. And although we tend to cite great names and classics, we end up secretly acknowledging that what influences a writer may well be a thriller, a phrase in a fashion catalogue, an extract from an anthology, a school textbook, something we never actually read, only dreamed of, or an author\u2019s biography rather than one of their works. Influence moves (and speaks) in mysterious ways.</p> <p>But is this always the case? Yes and no. When I was growing up in a village in Algeria in the 1970s, books were hard to find, bookshops and libraries nonexistent. I read what came to hand, not what I fancied. With reading matter scarce I got into the habit \u2013 which I still have \u2013 of reading things several times. So I naturally recall a book, much reread, on which I first stumbled by chance (in keeping with my belief that some force guides the appearance of books in our lives) and which I later covered carefully in fine paper. For me, The Fruits of the Earth (<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fruits_of_the_Earth\">Les Nourritures Terrestres</a></em>) by Andr\u00e9 Gide has become in some sense sacred.</p> <p>Few people now read this hymn to the human body, first published in 1897. It asserted the legitimacy of desire over morals and the right to enjoy our body over religion, lauding the senses rather than ideals. The revolution it heralded is outdated now. Les Nourritures Terrestres was written before the era of liberated sensuality or the view that orgasm is a human right. Today it would seem pass\u00e9, if only on account of its flamboyant style. But in the 1970s Algeria had only just gained its independence and seemed puritanical, governed by religious conservatism and austere socialism. So to me the book was a true revelation, spurring my revolt against any attempt by faith or politics to control my body.</p> <p>When I first read, and then reread, the book, I was over 16 and struggling to break free of a guilt-ridden religious ethos. Living in an isolated village with an illiterate family, my revolt often lacked suitable instruments or mentors. Revolt was possible in big towns, for the children of the elite or with the benefit of education, acquaintances or travel. In a village it was almost impossible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/13/book-gertrude-stein-autobiography-alice-b-toklas\">How a book by Gertrude Stein taught me to write about myself | Deborah Levy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So when I first opened Gide\u2019s book I was struck by two things: his incantatory, almost hypnotic style; and, above all, that this was a sincere cry from the heart. Here at last was the scripture I sought! I found out I could defend my body and my sexual inclinations without guilt. However simplistic such a claim might sound now, I started <em>feeling </em>things around me differently. It was as if their intensity had been restored. The world was no longer outclassed by some paradise to come; it could be a paradise, there and then. \u201cIt is not enough to read that the sand on the beach is soft,\u201d Gide wrote. \u201cI want my bare feet to feel it. I have no use for any knowledge that is not preceded by a sensation.\u201d</p> <p>It was my first initiation into freedom. Nowadays I reference key thinkers, ideological adversity or the leaders of uprisings, but I have to admit that it was this book that first suggested to me that it was possible to openly lead a free life, overturning the long established primacy of the invisible over the flesh. My body, I realised, was my only fortune, the sole palpable truth that I could share with another. Desire was thus the only means of achieving eternity. To this day all I can see in the main religious creeds is jealousy between forlorn gods, unable to assume human form and bite into an apple.</p> <p>With time we also come to understand that though a candle sheds light on the pages we turn, so too does an era. Which is why some books may seem, in a given context, to hold the solution to an enigma, yet later are no more use than an old key at the bottom of a drawer.</p> <p>Let me explain by way of another author. When I tell people in Europe that science fiction also played a role in liberating me from religion, they are often surprised. But the first books I read by Arthur C Clarke triggered a veritable big bang in me. How could this be? I grew up in a country where the earth was full of the tombs of the victims of our war of independence. The sky above was the preserve of the Almighty. Science fiction stripped the heavens of their divinity \u2013 it replaced religion with mystery and infinite space; neurotic prophecies with the adventures of astronauts. It restored my sense of dignity, reasserted my right to mystery and fuelled my appetite for discovery. In the west, science fiction is a genre. Elsewhere it may herald a Copernican revolution in the mind of a child.</p> <p>In this way, Gide\u2019s The Fruits of the Earth still resonates in me. On account of the memory of my early steps towards freedom. As for the copy of the book, I still have it.</p> <p>\u2022 Kamel Daoud is a journalist and the author of The Meursault Investigation</p> <p>\u2022 Translated by Harry Forster</p>",
  "<p>Tiffany Love is the chief operating officer of a small hospital in Winnemucca, Nevada, a rural town closer to the California\u2019s redwoods than the Las Vegas strip. Twenty-six people in Winnemucca have Covid-19, three of whom are in Love\u2019s hospital.</p> <p>While Love has enough personal protective equipment for her nurses right now, the possibility of running out of supplies is a constant anxiety. One supplier offered her a deal \u201cdirect from 3M\u201d, one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturers of high-quality N95 masks. </p> <p>There was one catch: she had to buy 10m masks at $5.20 each.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re desperate, we want to get PPE for our staff, but these are insane requests,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re a 25-bed community hospital, when will we ever use 10 million masks? Probably not in 10 years.\u201d</p> <p>A lack of protective equipment for staff has become a crisis within the pandemic without a cohesive federal response. But while small and public hospitals across the country struggle to obtain masks and gowns for their staff, billionaire board members of large medical centers have called in favors, and states are relying on wealthy philanthropists to close the gap.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/18/coronavirus-americans-protest-stay-at-home\">Thousands of Americans backed by rightwing donors gear up for protests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Previously, Donald Trump told states they were on their own, and the federal government was a \u201cback up.\u201d Then, Fema began <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/us/politics/coronavirus-fema-medical-supplies.html\">intercepting</a> some shipments ordered by states.

The municipal corporation oversees a perpetually cash-strapped 11-hospital health system, the largest in the US. But the orders were never filled.</p> <p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t worried about money, we were worried only about protecting our healthcare workers,\u201d said Katz, in an interview with the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmXjivXTm8I\">Journal of the American Medical Association</a>. \u201cAll of those supply lines collapsed,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe city system is under resourced,\u201d said Leon Bell, a senior policy analyst for the New York State Nurses Association. \u201c[Public hospitals] did not have the capacity, for example, which some of the private networks did, to call one of their billionaire board members, and say, \u2018Hey, you know this guy who owns this factory in China who makes N95 masks? Can you tell him to ship us a plane load?\u2019</p> <p>Later New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/coronavirus-us-ventilators-new-york-trump-touts-unproven-cure-malaria-drug\">publicly thanked</a> the co-founder of Chinese retail giant Alibaba for donating masks, gowns, goggles and ventilators.</p> <p>In Massachusetts, Governor Charlie Baker turned to the billionaire owner of the New England Patriots, Robert Kraft, for help obtaining masks for healthcare workers. In that instance, state officials used the New England Patriots\u2019 private plane to fly 1m N95 masks from China, after the federal government began intercepting personal protective equipment.</p> <p>\u201cYou could almost use the image of an orchestra. The federal government was the conductor and it kept all of the disparate instruments playing in harmony,\u201d said Dr William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. \u201cThat, at the very least, was a role we would have anticipated where the federal government was more active.\u201d </p> <p>The same uneven approach has created new shortages. Medical equipment distributors said isolation gowns have emerged as the most recent vital piece of equipment in short supply. A <a href=\"https://www.premierinc.com/newsroom/press-releases/premier-inc-survey-isolation-gowns-replace-n95-masks-as-the-top-shortage-concern-among-hospitals-and-health-systems-treating-covid-19-patients\">survey</a> by medical supply company Premier found that 74% of healthcare respondents now identify a lack of gowns as their top worry.</p> <p>\u201cRamping up the production of face masks and respirators appears to have affected the material supply needed for isolation gowns, easing one shortage only to exacerbate another,\u201d said Michael J Alkire, the president of Premier, which distributes personal protective equipment to more than 4,000 US hospitals and health systems.</p> <p>Already, an untold number of healthcare workers have contracted and died from Covid-19. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said at least 27 health workers have been killed by the virus, but, as the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/15/nurses-surgeons-janitors-first-us-health-workers-to-die-covid-19\">has reported</a>, that does not represent the true toll.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Nevada, Love said obtaining personal protective equipment in this environment resembles a chaotic auction, with hospitals and states bidding against each other.</p> <p>\u201cYou might have the money to outbid someone else, and then it means people in their community are going to die because you outbid?\u201d said Love. \u201cI committed my life to try to save lives, not to outlast the competition.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Malcolm Turnbull has accused Tony Abbott of the \u201cprofoundly dangerous\u201d decision to inflame animosity against Muslims while terrorism was the greatest security threat to Australia during his prime ministership.</p> <p>In a wide-ranging interview on ABC TV\u2019s 7.30, the former Liberal prime minister took aim at his predecessor for running an \u201cerratic\u201d and \u201cflaky\u201d government and his conservative ally turned challenger, Peter Dutton, for destroying his leadership in pursuit of the \u201cabsurd proposition\u201d he could lead the Coalition to victory.</p> <p>Turnbull is promoting his autobiography, A Bigger Picture, which chronicles both his life before becoming prime minister in September 2015 and his three years in power before Scott Morrison took the leadership in August 2018.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/20/government-officials-who-allegedly-distributed-malcolm-turnbulls-book-face-legal-action\">Government officials who allegedly distributed Malcolm Turnbull's book face legal action</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Turnbull praised his attorney general, George Brandis, for his insight in the extent to which the Liberal party had become \u201ctribalised\u201d between a liberal and a conservative faction, who Turnbull claims tore him down not because he stood to lose the next election but because they \u201cwould have preferred Bill Shorten to be prime minister than me\u201d.</p> <p>Turnbull accepted it was a \u201cfair criticism\u201d that he hadn\u2019t appreciated the extent of the party\u2019s tribal nature, but argued without cooperation from Dutton, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, and other conservatives his government could not have functioned effectively.</p> <p>In describing the events of August 2018, Turnbull again <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/sep/20/very-australian-coup-murdoch-turnbull-political-death-news-corps\">set out his case that Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp</a> and other conservative commentators were directly involved in instigating the spill and accused the conservative faction of \u201coperating like a terrorist\u201d in making threats to remove him.</p> <p>\u201cNow, they don\u2019t use guns and bombs, I hasten to add,\u201d he said. \u201cBut \u2026 it is the technique of terrorism, where you create enough mayhem, enough damage that people in the middle say it\u2019s got to come to an end; how can I stop this terrible horror?\u201d</p> <p>Turnbull said he called the first spill \u2013 in which Dutton won 35 votes, partly due to Morrison allies including Stuart Robert voting for the challenger \u2013 to \u201cflush out\u201d his opponents, and insisted he could have continued as prime minister if Cormann had not switched loyalties later that week.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/20/malcolm-turnbull-on-donald-trump-you-dont-suck-up-to-bullies\">Former Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull on Donald Trump: 'You don't suck up to bullies'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Turnbull said it was \u201cpossible but unlikely\u201d that Morrison\u2019s allies had voted for Dutton to weaken him without Morrison\u2019s knowledge, but explained he backed Morrison in the second and decisive spill to prevent Dutton from winning the leadership.</p> <p>Turnbull defended his record successfully challenging two Liberal leaders, first Brendan Nelson in September 2008, and then Tony Abbott in September 2015.</p> <p>Turnbull said he had challenged Abbott because he had \u201cbasically abandoned cabinet government\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHis whole style of government was erratic and flaky \u2026 from a national security point of view,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAt a time when terrorism was our biggest \u2026domestic security issue, Abbott was determined to ramp up the rhetoric in a way that was calculated to inflame animosity against Muslims.</p> <p>\u201cThat was obviously lapped up and echoed by the Murdoch press, who were doing the same thing. That made Australia less safe. It was profoundly dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>Turnbull accused \u201cbillionaire media proprietors\u201d of removing him not because of policy differences on climate change or same-sex marriage, but because \u201cthey wanted to have again a prime minister who they felt they had some control over, they had an ownership of \u2026 and they wanted to feel that, as they had done with Abbott, that they were in charge\u201d.</p> <p>Turnbull accused right-wing media of playing on \u201cirrational fears\u201d and \u201cstoking division\u201d on the issue of climate change.</p> <p>\u201cThe bottom line is that they do not, the right wing of the Liberal Party and the National Party, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/24/turnbull-warns-against-politics-of-race-and-says-climate-policy-very-hard-for-coalition\">do not accept the reality of climate change</a>,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cSome of them are franker about it than others, like Barnaby Joyce; ah most of them, you know, use mealy-mouthed expressions \u2026 but underpinning it all is a refusal to recognise that we have a responsibility to reduce our emissions.\u201d</p> <p>Turnbull said he realised Dutton wanted the leadership very late because he did not imagine Dutton could be \u201cso deluded as to imagine that our political prospects would be advanced by a change of leadership, and especially to him\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt never occurred to me, frankly, that \u2026 so many people would support him.</p> <p>\u201cI mean \u2026 if Dutton had become leader, not even Bill Shorten could have lost the election!\u201d</p> <p>Turnbull praised the efforts of \u201call the governments in Australia\u201d for the response to coronavirus which have so far been effective in flattening the curve of its spread, but warned satisfaction was \u201cno cause for complacency\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBut the economic shock will be massive,\u201d he warned.</p>",

  "<p><strong>What was your reaction when asked to play Malvolia?</strong><br>I was offered Olivia but she wasn\u2019t on my list of must-play roles. Theatre is such a commitment I need to be really picky. It\u2019s a big deal, being out every night and away from family. The National came back with the idea of Malvolio and my interest was piqued. The director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/feb/27/simon-godwin-british-director-us-theatre\">Simon Godwin</a> and I read the play a lot together, just the two of us, and then with Ben Power, deputy artistic director at the NT, and then with a group of actors. But part of me was quite resistant. They said what about making the character Malvolia so you\u2019re playing a woman? We did more workshops. I was very nervous of making Malvolio a woman and therefore a lesbian, considering what happens to the character in the play, which is monstrous.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/feb/23/twelfth-night-review-olivier-national-theatre-tamsin-greig\">Twelfth Night review \u2013 Tamsin Greig is brilliant in a show full of fun</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>How did you balance the elements of comedy and cruelty?<br></strong>I wanted to find out more about the ridiculousness in Malvolia. Sometimes people develop coping strategies that make them foolish. Malvolia is a deeply wounded human being who becomes OCD and bullies the other people in the household in order to cope. She meets her match in Feste. I thought it was a brilliant idea to invite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/nov/20/doon-mackichan-sexy-funny-women-interview-two-doors-down-smack-the-pony\">Doon Mackichan</a> to play Feste and to make Fabian become Fabia. You\u2019ve then got two more women who are the authors of the cruelty against Malvolia, alongside Maria. I thought that was interesting \u2013 there is so much cruelty against women perpetrated by women themselves. The self-judgment of women is awful. We started exploring what it was about Feste that enabled her to be so calculatedly and comically cruel to Malvolia.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIOJBmpRtYo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SIOJBmpRtYo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><strong>As Malvolia, you use precise hand gestures that tell us much about the character<br></strong>It\u2019s an outward expression of her need to create order out of chaos. Hand gestures are often so much about threat and control. I trained as a dancer and am interested in what the whole body does. The way we express ourselves goes right to the very tips of our fingers. There is a moment when Malvolia comes on and tells Olivia there is a boy at the door who won\u2019t go away. I started to use a repeated gesture of pushing him towards her. Then Phoebe Fox, as Olivia, says to tell him to go away and she repeats the gesture back. Malvolia gets rather confused about why Olivia is using that gesture so does it again. It became a beautiful moment.</p> <p><strong>Malvolia\u2019s judgment of the other characters extends towards the audience. How was that idea developed?<br></strong>I was overwhelmed by the size of the Olivier theatre, particularly in the letter scene which could be seen as a monologue. But I don\u2019t think Shakespeare ever allows monologues to be internal. It\u2019s a process of working out what you think about something in the company of 1,000 or so people in the audience. Who those people are is up to the actor to decide. I felt that Malvolia had a lot of internal voices which were powerful and controlling. So the audience embodied those internal voices and during the letter scene she is engaging with them to help her work out what this all means. I was afraid of it but the stage is so well designed to hold all of those people that it became weirdly intimate. The audience\u2019s delight in the comic thrust of that scene encourages Malvolia. No internal voice stops her \u2013 there is no voice of reason.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1ad70fe52d0bce5acd247cdd2838803b84a8f6d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ad70fe52d0bce5acd247cdd2838803b84a8f6d0/0_153_4833_2899/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tamsin Greig as Malvolia and Phoebe Fox as Olivia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tamsin Greig as Malvolia and Phoebe Fox as Olivia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Brenner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I was reading the script I didn\u2019t know how to pronounce \u201cflough\u201d in the letter. I said it in different ways to Simon and he laughed. Later he said: let\u2019s keep that in \u2013 maybe Malvolia doesn\u2019t know how to say it? Then I thought suppose one of the internal voices can help her pronounce it. Each night I elicited someone from the audience to tell me how to say it, so they are effectively egging her on in her belief. When, at the end, she says she will be revenged on the whole pack of them it\u2019s Malvolia realising that no one was courageous enough to stop her and tell her she\u2019s being ridiculous.</p> <p><strong>For the NT Live filming, how do you modulate your usual stage performance?<br></strong>When we rehearsed for the NT Live version we did it without an audience and I fell apart \u2013 I couldn\u2019t remember the lines. Malvolia works when she is in relationship to the audience rather than many of the other characters. A large part of the stalls was filled with camera equipment and it becomes difficult to engage with a body of people. It\u2019s a bit like when I did <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/black-books\">Black Books</a>, which was filmed in front of a live audience. It\u2019s hard to know whether you\u2019re playing to that number of people in the room or in a quiet way to the camera.

Yours becomes a cabaret-style showstopper<br></strong>It\u2019s such a hot moment in the play. At the time, a puritan coming on in yellow stockings would have been unbearably shocking. I thought in this hyperreal world, where she\u2019s a woman, what would be shocking about her wearing yellow tights? So we needed to push it to find ultimate embarrassment. And because I have teenagers I thought what would upset them most to see me doing? I said to the designer Soutra Gilmour that this moment reminded me of popping corn: you have a dry kernel and you cook it in the pan with butter and it pops. Soutra created this amazing costume \u2013 she wanted Malvolia\u2019s pierrot cape to look like a piece of popped corn. The composer Michael Bruce had written all this beautiful smooth jazz for the production \u2013 cool, melancholic, quite sexy. I told him we\u2019ll need something for Malvolia\u2019s number when she comes down the stairs in yellow stockings. I just meant a piece of music but Michael came in the next day and he\u2019d put a Shakespeare sonnet to music. In one evening! He said: \u201cYeah, and you\u2019re going to sing it!\u201d Well, it would have been rude not to!</p> <p><strong>What other Shakespeare parts are on your to-do list?<br></strong>I always used to say I didn\u2019t want to play Lady Macbeth because I find it too frightening. She really faces the darkest part of herself. But I\u2019d love to give that a go. I don\u2019t want to be the go-to actor who plays traditionally male roles. But I do think Simon Godwin is on to something about the need to re-envision Shakespeare plays. You know how they did Frankenstein at the NT with two actors swapping roles? Wouldn\u2019t it be interesting if you had male and female actors swapping Macbeth and Lady Macbeth?</p> <ul> <li><p>Twelfth Night streams on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUDq1XzCY0NIOYVJvEMQjqw\">YouTube</a> from 7pm on 23 April as part of <a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/nt-at-home\">National Theatre at Home</a>.

  "<p>Last spring, <a href=\"http://www.mind-the-gap.org.uk/\">Mind the Gap</a> set out to tackle the stigma people with learning disabilities face when becoming parents. Their enormous outdoor production at Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park in south London featured more than 100 performers, tanks and a puppet of a baby bigger than a double-decker bus. Now, as the baby turns one, they\u2019ve <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90GR7q7NI3o\">made the show available online</a>.</p> <p>Soon-to-be-mum Zara (JoAnne Haines) has learning disabilities and the authorities don\u2019t think she\u2019s capable of being a parent. Framed as a breaking news bulletin on the day of the birth, the drama is led by energetic presenter Sam Hill. With Haines elevated on a crane, negotiations with social services go awry and the night descends into a literal war zone: the army is deployed. Joyce Nga Yu Lee directs a fantastic spectacle with cannon-streamer baby poo and sirened cars wheeling about.</p> <p>Next to Zara is the heart of both show and conflict: the big-bellied baby. She\u2019s a beautiful bit of puppetry with enormous swinging arms and inquisitive eyes. Some of the puppeteers attach a ladder to her chest in order to pop a dummy in her mouth, while others control her pudgy hand to indignantly pluck it out.</p> <p>The question swirling is how best to serve the baby\u2019s needs, but all the production\u2019s possible answers seem over-simplified. The enormity of the display doesn\u2019t give much opportunity for subtlety. Instead, the focus is on making the audience consider how it feels to be on the receiving end of mass lack of expectation and constant intervention.</p> <p>Some of the production values don\u2019t have the same impact through the screen \u2013 particularly the 3D projection mapping \u2013 but the multi-camera recording is otherwise adept at giving a vibrant sense of the experience. Zara successfully challenges assumptions, and boldly and creatively gives a voice to parents with learning disabilities.</p> <ul> <li><p>Available on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90GR7q7NI3o\">YouTube</a> until 11 May.</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>The Covid-19 epidemic is ravaging our tattered healthcare system and shredding our economy. In the past month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/16/us-unemployment-coronavirus-economic-toll-jobless\">over 22 million</a> Americans filed for unemployment benefits, compounding the fear that unemployment could <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/30/coronavirus-job-losses-could-total-47-million-unemployment-rate-of-32percent-fed-says.html\">breach 32%</a> absent massive public action. This is an unmitigated human disaster, recalling the horrors of the Great Depression. And it gets worse. We\u2019re also facing the climate emergency. <a href=\"https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2020/3/31/we-need-to-cancel-rent-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic\">Immediate</a> <a href=\"https://www.dataforprogress.org/memos/the-care-economy\">relief</a> is necessary \u2013 but not sufficient. To tackle all these crises at once, we need a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@green_stimulus_now/a-green-stimulus-to-rebuild-our-economy-1e7030a1d9ee\">Green Stimulus</a> that creates jobs and lifts up communities in ways that also slash carbon pollution, increase resiliency, and develop a just, modern economy.</p> <p>No one can predict when Speaker Nancy Pelosi and President Donald Trump will turn their full attention to economic recovery. But behind the scenes, the planning has already begun. It\u2019s not a question of whether we spend big on stimulus, but what kind of stimulus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-zip/giv-3902biaigqdp2WsL/index.html\" data-alt=\"covering climate now series linker\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-zip/giv-3902biaigqdp2WsL/index.html\">covering climate now series linker</a> </figure>  <p>And while Republicans will decry anything \u201cgreen\u201d, we can win the argument. But much of what we propose already has bipartisan support, from <a href=\"https://www.dataforprogress.org/memos/green-industrial-policy\">polling</a> to <a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/whats-in-the-senate-energy-bill-for-clean-energy-smart-grid-and-energy-storage\">pending legislation</a>.</p> <p>Climate change is about to supercharge the coronavirus emergency. In April, California\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/california-wildfires/article/Could-coronavirus-collide-with-fire-season-15128059.php\">wildfire season will start</a>. Restrictions on work caused by the pandemic will make it harder for firefighters to conduct controlled burns that steer fires \u2013 and smoke \u2013 from homes. Californians\u2019 lungs could face Covid-19 and unusually intense smoke at the same time. A <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/03/19/spring-flood-outlook-nws/\">third of the country</a> also faces serious flood risk through the spring. And in summer and fall, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/04/02/above-average-atlantic-hurricane-season-predicted-including-possible-major-hurricane-strike/\">forecasters predict</a> \u201cabove average probability for major hurricanes making landfall along the continental United States\u201d. We\u2019re already seeing this catastrophic convergence elsewhere: In Ecuador, <a href=\"https://earther.gizmodo.com/this-is-what-climate-change-looks-like-in-an-era-of-cov-1842539967\">a muted government response</a> to flooding in indigenous communities, for fear of spreading the virus; in Fiji, devastated by Cyclone Harold this week, 19 confirmed coronavirus cases are casting doubt on how to rebuild.</p> <p>Here too, we will need to find ways to do the needed relief work without deepening the pandemic. Amid all this suffering, the case for bold moves to tackle the miseries of inequality, Covid, and climate at once will get clearer.</p> <p>Moreover, green stimulus is the only option for a smooth transition to the 21st century green economy. The era of dirty energy is ending. Even the conservative CBNC analyst Jim Cramer has <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/09/jim-cramer-investors-should-sell-oil-stocks-on-any-rumored-opec-deal.html\">warned investors</a> that oil stocks are no longer safe investments, as society is increasingly repudiating fossil fuels. Giant investors like Blackrock are gradually <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/14/business/dealbook/larry-fink-blackrock-climate-change.html\">winding down</a> their investments in carbon. And at the <a href=\"https://www.pv-magazine.com/2020/04/14/european-leaders-push-green-recovery-plan-for-post-covid-economy/\">European</a> level, and in countries like <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/germany-touts-green-stimulus-in-post-covid-19-policy-push\">Germany</a> and <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidrvetter/2020/04/16/south-korea-embraces-eu-style-green-deal-for-covid-19-recovery/#7089bc4a5611\">South Korea</a>, a green stimulus-based recovery is becoming the consensus choice, with investments in efficiency and clean energy seen as obvious drivers of economic reconstruction.</p> <p>Here in the US, green stimulus is easily the best way to create good jobs through public investment. <a href=\"http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTOGMC/Resources/Measuring_the_employment_impact_of_energy_sector1.pdf\">According to a 2011 World Bank</a> study, $1m invested in the oil and gas in the United States creates just five jobs, compared to 17 jobs per million dollars invested in energy-saving building retrofits, 22 jobs for mass transit, 13 for wind, and 14 for solar. <a href=\"https://rael.berkeley.edu/publication/putting-renewables-and-energy-efficiency-to-work-how-many-jobs-can-the-clean-energy-industry-generate-in-the-us/\">Kammen\u2019s research</a> and that of <a href=\"https://citizensclimatelobby.org/laser-talks/jobs-fossil-fuels-vs-renewables/\">other institutes</a> all concur that investment in a modern green economy is a more efficient job creator than the fossil sector.</p> <p>The longer-term vision of the green stimulus is a more rewarding, lifelong career of dignified green work. We should also invest in Stem education for all<em> </em>children and create apprenticeship programs in vulnerable communities, matched with new careers for workers to enter. And by directly investing in frontline communities, following <a href=\"https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/california-climate-investments\">best practices</a> in California, we can bring technologies like solar and battery storage to neighborhoods that have been <a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/report-finds-wide-racial-and-ethnic-disparities-in-rooftop-solar\">scandalously left out</a> of the clean energy boom so far. Plus, these same nimble, local solutions make neighborhoods more resilient to extreme weather. Local storage and nested microgrids make the power system, including healthcare facilities, more reliable during disasters. We\u2019d be making environmental, economic, and social improvements in the same places, at the same time.</p> <p>And we should speak of green investments in concrete terms. <a href=\"https://www.dataforprogress.org/memos/green-industrial-policy\">Polling conducted</a> by Data for Progress in March finds majority support for massive green spending overall. More interesting is the finding of even greater support \u2013 including majority Republican approval \u2013 for <em>specific</em> public green investments, like electric buses, retrofits to low-income housing, and renewable energy. Strip away abstract rhetoric, and the substance that we\u2019re advocating is incredibly popular.</p> <p>For these reasons, we recently joined nine other experts in social and climate policy to write a letter to Congress outlining a menu of policy options for a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@green_stimulus_now/a-green-stimulus-to-rebuild-our-economy-1e7030a1d9ee\">Green Stimulus</a>. Our proposals span eight sectors of the economy. But fundamentally, a Green Stimulus is about mobilizing massive public funds \u2013 say, $2tn to start \u2013 in specific green investments to create high-quality jobs and improve the quality of life, especially in low-income communities, communities of color, and indigenous communities, which have suffered the most disinvestment and pollution in recent decades.</p> <p>It seems counterintuitive, but the timing for such a Green Stimulus is perfect. Bridge-loans and advance payments on public green purchases of goods like solar panels and electric vehicles for public use would stabilize firms\u2019 and workers\u2019 finances. Announcing initiatives like a Climate Conservation Corps would give young people eager to work jobs to apply for, and plan to start. And desk workers across the economy could get on Zoom and do paperwork to make green projects shovel-ready the minute it\u2019s safe to break ground. (Indeed, <a href=\"https://weatherization.ornl.gov/wp-content/uploads/pdf/WAPRecoveryActEvalFinalReports/ORNL_TM-2015_139.pdf\">a major reason</a> the 2009 Obama stimulus faltered was months wasted on paperwork.)</p> <p>Each of us has lived through climate-fueled disasters \u2013 in Cohen\u2019s case, Hurricane Sandy, and in Kammen\u2019s, last year\u2019s devastating wildfires. We agree with the environmental justice advocates who argued then that disaster recovery shouldn\u2019t be about trying to <a href=\"https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2019/04/advocate-climate-policy-must-also-address-inequality/\">bounce </a><em><a href=\"https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2019/04/advocate-climate-policy-must-also-address-inequality/\">back</a></em> to how things were before the disaster. We don\u2019t want to bounce back to a January 2020 economy when half the country lived paycheck to paycheck; unchecked carbon pollution endangered our future; and <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pke94n/cancer-alley-has-some-of-the-highest-coronavirus-death-rates-in-the-country\">racial</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/climate/air-pollution-coronavirus-covid.html\">inequalities</a> made people of color so vulnerable to disease. Rather, by deploying a Green Stimulus that centers workers and communities, we can bounce forward together.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Daniel Aldana Cohen is a</em><em>ssistant p</em><em>rofessor of s</em><em>ociology at the University of Pennsylvania, where he directs the Socio-Spatial Climate Collaborative, or (SC)2, and is a co-author of A Planet to Win: Why We Need a Green New Deal</em></p></li> <li><p><em>Daniel Kammen is p</em><em>rofessor at the University of California, Berkeley, c</em><em>oordinating l</em><em>ead a</em><em>uthor for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and former Science Envoy for the United States Department of State</em></p></li> <li><p><em>This story is a part of Covering Climate Now\u2019s week of coverage focused on climate solutions, to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

There have been more than 11,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus across the New Orleans metropolitan area.</p> <p>But Transdev, the company that manages New Orleans\u2019s public bus and streetcar system, is still not offering employees additional paid sick leave during the pandemic.</p> <p>When local union officials started checking in on New Orleans drivers, they heard from multiple people who had symptoms of coronavirus but were still showing up to work, worried about losing their only source of income or about the company\u2019s strict attendance policy, said Valerie Jefferson, the president of the local affiliate of the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU).</p> <p>Jefferson said a lot of the union\u2019s members are single parents.<strong> </strong>One driver who had lost multiple family members to coronavirus told Jefferson she was worried that if she called in sick because of her own symptoms, she might be fired. \u201cMorale is very, very low,\u201d Jefferson said.</p> <p>One New Orleans driver, who asked to remain anonymous,<strong> </strong>told the Guardian they had continued<strong> </strong>to drive a city bus for two weeks after first experiencing coronavirus symptoms.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes you would get gloves and you wouldn\u2019t get a mask.

The company called on the federal and state governments to fund protections, pay and benefits for frontline workers.</p> <p>Transdev \u201chas been forced to lay off hundreds of people and make across-the-board salary cuts,\u201d the spokesperson said.</p> <p>Transdev added that it had informed its New Orleans employees in early March that its harsh sick leave had been suspended because of coronavirus, and said that it had not disciplined any workers for calling in sick.</p> <p>Four employees and Jefferson, the local union president, said they had never been informed that the sick leave policy had changed, and that no notification of a suspension in the discipline policy had ever been posted in the normal locations.</p> <p>In a subsequent statement, Transdev confirmed that the company had not posted any explicit notification of the suspension in New Orleans, but said that supervisors had communicated the policy change to employees verbally.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Regional Transit Authority, the agency that pays Transdev to manage New Orleans\u2019 transit system, said staff had worked \u201caround the clock\u201d to put new measures in place to protect frontline workers, even as many people, from administrative staff to <a href=\"https://www.nola.com/news/coronavirus/article_e06d256c-7910-11ea-af63-4fa4334ccb28.html\">the organization\u2019s CEO</a>, were themselves becoming sick.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9e6f33b026219bd070de04f9503a625c63e18161\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e6f33b026219bd070de04f9503a625c63e18161/0_123_5376_3225/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People wear masks as they wait or a San Francisco MUNI bus during the coronavirus pandemic on 6 April 2020 in San Francisco, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People wear masks as they wait or a San Francisco MUNI bus during the coronavirus pandemic on 6 April 2020 in San Francisco, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Early on, it was not recommended that people wear masks\u2019</h2> <p>Across the country, some transit agencies acted quickly to protect drivers. In Oakland and Berkeley, California, \u201cWe had an abundance of supplies when this first broke,\u201d said<strong> </strong>Yvonne Williams, the president of the local transit union.</p> <p>Though there have been some shortages, drivers started getting personal protective equipment on 13 March, she said, and the transit agency also allowed bus drivers 65 and older to stay home with pay.</p> <p>Across the bay in San Francisco, bus drivers did not receive masks until 2 April, though a transit spokeswoman said drivers did have a built-in protective barrier on their vehicles.</p> <p>New York City had begun issuing basic masks to its full transit workforce after 27<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://www.mta.info/press-release/mta-headquarters/mta-announces-distribution-75000-masks-heroic-frontline-workforce\">March</a>, and began giving transit workers the highest-quality N95 masks on 4<strong> </strong>April, according to a transit spokesperson.</p> <p>But it took weeks for other major cities to take similar measures. They blamed difficulties in obtaining masks and a lack of guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advising members of the general public to wear masks until 3 April.</p> <p>In Columbus, Ohio, bus drivers for weeks received gloves but no masks, as confirmed coronavirus cases in the midwestern city surged from dozens to hundreds.</p> <p>When the region\u2019s transit authority finally started issuing lower-grade cloth and medical masks to drivers on 8 April, they were asked to sign waivers acknowledging that they understood the masks did not offer full protection. Higher-quality N95 masks have been ordered, but not yet distributed, an agency spokesperson said.</p> <p>In Denver, Colorado, the president of the local transit workers\u2019 union said he had raised the issue of masks for drivers in a meeting with a transit official on 12 March. It was not until 8 April that drivers actually received high-quality masks, and they were provided by the union.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s really the first frontline protection that any of our operators have gotten,\u201d said Lance Logenbohn, the local transit union president.</p> <p>Early on, he said, there had even been resistance to drivers wearing their own masks.</p> <p>\u201cI had reports that people were being told that they couldn\u2019t wear the masks they were providing for themselves,\u201d Logenbohn said. \u201cAt that point, shamefully, I believe there was concern ... of the image of a driver wearing a mask.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Denver area\u2019s Regional Transportation District said the agency was continuing to struggle to source the needed masks, and that \u201cearly on, it was not recommended to the public that people wear masks unless they felt sick.\u201d</p> <p>Steven Markowitz, an occupational health expert at the City University of New York, said he doesn\u2019t blame transit agencies for relying on the CDC. \u201cThey are our public health authorities for situations like this,\u201d Markowitz said. But the CDC \u201cmade a mistake in not recommending masks earlier,\u201d he argued.</p> <p>\u201cBus drivers need masks. I think they need N95 masks,\u201d Markowitz said.</p> <p>Bus drivers often stay on the job into their 50s or 60s because their access to pension benefits tend to be less generous than other public workers. Because they spend a full day in traffic exposed to air pollution, drivers are also more likely to have a chronic disease. Advanced age and chronic health issues put many drivers at risk for complications due to Covid-19. On top of those risks, bus drivers now have \u201ceight hour, full shift exposure\u201d to large numbers of other high-risk workers, like medical and grocery workers, Markowitz said.</p> <p>The bottom line: Bus drivers \u201cwould have been better off had they gotten masks earlier,\u201d Markowitz said.</p> <p>The CDC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b681fe549030f32e43aaa7ec59e48cdd717f6897\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b681fe549030f32e43aaa7ec59e48cdd717f6897/0_282_4235_2542/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bus driver wears a face mask as he drives a Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority bus on 15 April 2020 in Washington DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bus driver wears a face mask as he drives a Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority bus on 15 April 2020 in Washington DC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Hazard pay is not under consideration\u2019</h2> <p>If Amazon workers and some grocery store employees are getting an additional $2 an hour during the pandemic, bus drivers argue, they deserve hazard pay, too.</p> <p>Even with a mask, driving a public bus during a pandemic is anxious work. \u201cAnytime somebody coughs, you look in the mirror, because you\u2019re kind of nervous,\u201d said Lyntel Cannon, 59, who has worked as a Columbus bus driver for 23 years.</p> <p>So far, Cannon said, the main acknowledgement bus drivers in his city had received for risking their lives was a free pizza. The next week, it was a boxed sandwich.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want food. That won\u2019t cheer us up,\u201d Cannon said. \u201cWhat would be helpful for most of us is pandemic pay.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Columbus\u2019 transit agency \u201cwanted to show our appreciation for what we call our heroic frontline workers by offering them lunch,\u201d Jeff Pullin, a spokesman for the Central Ohio Transit Authority, said.</p> <p>\u201cHazard pay is not under consideration right now,\u201d Pullin added.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0a3440b936a5f968ac7ad4101a05294115b5c321\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a3440b936a5f968ac7ad4101a05294115b5c321/0_0_5197_3120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman carries birthday balloons as she enters a bus in the Queens borough of New York City on 13 April 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman carries birthday balloons as she enters a bus in the Queens borough of New York City on 13 April 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johannes Eisele/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Some victories \u2013 but new problems</h2> <p>A few cities are beginning to offer bus drivers additional pay for the risk they are taking. Milwaukee, Wisconsin, announced last week that bus drivers would receive $200 a week in additional hazard pay, going back to 15 March, a transit spokeswoman said.</p> <p>Last week, Atlanta\u2019s transit agency announced that it would be offering transit workers \u201c<a href=\"https://www.itsmarta.com/MARTA-takes-additional-steps-covid-19-pandemic.aspx\">a one-time hero payment of $500</a>\u201d, in recognition of their service at the front lines of the pandemic.</p> <p>Columbus, Oakland, and the state of New Jersey, among others, now require face masks or other coverings for transit passengers. In Columbus, bus passengers will be given flexibility to use any kind of fabric covering, from a bandana to a scarf to a T-shirt. Philadelphia <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/transportation/septa-face-masks-requirement-coronavirus-20200410.html\">reversed</a> a mandate that transit passengers wear masks, according to <a href=\"https://whyy.org/articles/septa-is-giving-masks-to-riders-after-backlash-to-face-covering-mandate/\">local news reports</a>, after a video surfaced of police officers dragging a man off a city bus, allegedly for refusing to wear a mask.</p> <p>Other attempts to make drivers safer have had unintended consequences. Many cities now ask most passengers to enter and exit through the rear door of buses, further away from the drivers at the front. In many cases, this has required suspending fares, since fare boxes are usually next to the driver.</p> <p>Bus drivers say making rides free has created a new stress for them: buses filled with<strong> </strong>homeless people, teenagers<strong> </strong>and others using the free ride as a safe place to rest while other public locations are closed.</p> <p>Conflict with passengers now carries additional anxieties. In Columbus, a man was charged with assault after he spat in a bus driver\u2019s face and said he had coronavirus, <a href=\"https://www.10tv.com/article/police-man-charged-after-claiming-have-covid-19-spitting-cota-bus-drivers-face-2020-apr\">according to news reports</a>. The driver had reportedly told the man, who appeared to be intoxicated, to get off the bus.</p> <p>A bus driver in Milwaukee, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Guardian they had driven one man around for several hours before telling him that it was time to get off the bus, then calling security. The man pushed his way to the front of the bus, lifted his mask, and coughed directly on the driver before disembarking, the driver said.</p> <p>\u201cI panicked so bad, my whole body was shutting down,\u201d the driver said. A<strong> </strong>dispatcher told the driver to keep driving.</p> <p>The Milwaukee driver had only been wearing a mask during the incident because the driver had personally bought masks, since the city was not yet giving them out, the driver said.</p> <p>A week later, the Milwaukee driver was still waiting to see if they would develop symptoms.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re really risking our lives out here, every day,\u201d the driver said.</p> <p><em><strong>Are you a bus driver or other transit worker?

  "<p>It can feel wrong, or simply impossible, to focus on anything other than getting through this most challenging moment. It is reasonable to argue that since lessons will not reduce our immediate suffering, we should learn them once we\u2019re through this. But the vulnerability that makes the present so painful is exactly why some discussions cannot wait. The suffering we stand to reduce or increase by the threads of action that we begin to unwind now could be magnitudes of what we\u2019re currently experiencing.</p> <p>Imagine that while your country practised social distancing, your neighbouring country responded to Covid-19 by packing citizens into gymnasiums by the tens of thousands. Imagine if, in addition, they instituted genetic and pharmaceutical interventions that helped their citizens maintain productivity under such adverse conditions, even though this had the unfortunate side effect of devastating their immune systems. And to complete this dystopian vision, imagine if your neighbours simultaneously reduced their number of doctors tenfold. Such actions would radically increase death rates not only within their country, but yours. Pathogens do not respect national boundaries. They are not Spanish or Chinese.</p> <p>Pathogens do not respect species boundaries, either. Influenza and coronaviruses move fluidly between human and animal populations, just as they move fluidly between nations. When it comes to pandemics, there is not animal health and human health \u2013 not any more than there is Korean health and French health. Social distancing works only when everyone practises it, and \u201ceveryone\u201d includes animals.</p> <p>The meat that we eat today overwhelmingly comes from genetically uniform, immunocompromised, and regularly drugged animals lodged by the tens of thousands into buildings or stacked cages \u2013 no matter how the meat is labelled. We know this, and most of us would strongly prefer it be otherwise. But we would prefer a lot of things in the world that aren\u2019t so and, for most of us, the future of animal farming is low on our list of priorities, especially now. It is understandable to be most concerned with oneself. The problem is, we aren\u2019t doing a good job of being selfish.</p> <p>We don\u2019t yet know the full history of the emergence of Covid-19, the particular strain of coronavirus that now threatens us. But with recent pandemic virus threats from influenza viruses such as<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-h1n1-pandemic.html\"> H1N1 (swine flu)</a> or <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/h5n1-people.htm\">H5N1 (bird flu)</a> there is no ambiguity: those viruses evolved on chicken and pig factory farms. Genetic analyses have shown that crucial components of H1N1 emerged from a virus circulating in North American pigs. But it is commercial poultry operations that appear to be the Silicon Valley of viral development.</p> <p>It is on chicken factory farms that we have most frequently found viruses that have mutated from a form found only in animals into a form that harms humans (what scientists call \u201cantigenic shift\u201d). It is these \u201cnovel\u201d viruses that our immune systems are unfamiliar with and that can prove most deadly.</p> <p>Of <a href=\"https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fflu%2Fpandemic-resources%2Fmonitoring%2Firat-virus-summaries.htm&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C7b6bfb3bb84047f840d208d7e18037bc%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637225813109294161&amp;sdata=736Z4bJxFJCB3PPiovRw%2Bdc%2BQjkz8MdM6T8acoCWNEI%3D&amp;reserved=0\">16 strains</a> of novel influenza viruses currently identified by the CDC as \u201cof special concern,\u201d including H5N1, 11 come from viruses of the H5 or H7 type. In 2018 a group of scientists analysed the 39 antigenic shifts, also called \u201cconversion events,\u201d that we know played a key role in the emergence of these particularly dangerous strains. Their <a href=\"https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.frontiersin.org%2Farticles%2F10.3389%2Ffvets.2018.00084%2Ffull&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C7b6bfb3bb84047f840d208d7e18037bc%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637225813109294161&amp;sdata=bwdH2qZZjRMkBHrLklF5NOgpa5BtMXGT4r%2BDHZiejX4%3D&amp;reserved=0\">results</a> prove that \u201call but two of these events were reported in commercial poultry production systems\u201d.</p> <p>Imagine if our military leaders told us that almost every terrorist in recent memory had spent time in the same training camp, but no politician would call for an investigation of the training camp. Imagine if we knew that those terrorists were developing weapons more destructive than any that has been used, or tested, in human history. This is our situation when it comes to pandemics and farming.</p> <p>The United States CDC is the abbreviation for an agency whose name is actually the Centers for Disease Control <em>and Prevention. </em>We drop <em>prevention</em> from the acronym, which is innocent enough. But we also tend to drop serious discussion of prevention in favour of tactics for responding once pandemics hit. This is understandable \u2013 especially in the midst of a pandemic \u2013 but recklessly dangerous. We are preoccupied with the production of face masks, but we appear unconcerned with the farms that are producing pandemics. The world is burning and we are reaching for more fire extinguishers while gasoline soaks through the tinder at our feet.</p> <p>To reduce risk of pandemics for ourselves, our gaze needs to turn to the health of animals. In the case of wild animal populations, such as the bats that scientists have theorised as a probable origination point for Covid-19, the best solution seems to be to limit and regulate human interaction. Much has rightly been written on this and, slowly and unevenly, policies seem to be moving in the right direction. As it became established that a number of people contracted the virus after visiting a wet market in Wuhan, where the virus likely passed through humans from bats via an intermediate host, China shut down 19,000 wildlife-farming operations and banned meat from wild animals at wet markets.</p> <p>In the case of farmed animals, though, the lack of public understanding has allowed unscrupulous corporations to move policy in exactly the wrong direction. Across the globe, corporations have succeeded in creating policies that use public resources to promote industrial farming. One <a href=\"https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fenvironment%2F2019%2Fsep%2F16%2F1m-a-minute-the-farming-subsidies-destroying-the-world&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C7b6bfb3bb84047f840d208d7e18037bc%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637225813109304156&amp;sdata=GLpuUPdx6rQhukwztXyJ4GBHrQhsktxUJcwrUm%2FAdm4%3D&amp;reserved=0\">study</a> suggests that the public is providing $1m per minute in global farm subsidies, overwhelmingly used to prop up and expand the current broken model. The same $1m a minute that promotes factory farming also increases pandemic risk.</p> <p>In the US, the death rate for Covid-19 has been less than 2%, but had this been, say, H5N1 the death rate would be far higher \u2013 the CDC reports a <a href=\"https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fflu%2Favianflu%2Fh5n1-people.htm&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C7b6bfb3bb84047f840d208d7e18037bc%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637225813109304156&amp;sdata=Zb8vPV9oPivRrGILQHvQCs0STXVYHsW051owYDo2XUI%3D&amp;reserved=0\">60% death rate</a>. After a spike of H5N1 deaths in 2017, the virus\u2019s spread subsided for reasons that remain unclear. Should we be relieved? <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/onehealth/pdf/castelbrando/nancy_j_cox.pdf\">Nancy Cox,</a> who led CDC\u2019s influenza operations for more than two decades, has emphasised: \u201cWe don\u2019t know how the story\u2019s going to end.\u201d H5N1\u2019s failure to reach pandemic proportions simply means we have a terrorist kicking around who is just one small viral mutation away from obtaining the equivalent of a nuclear arsenal.</p> <p>The implications of a 1-2% death rate are all around us: half of the world is living under stay-at-home orders, children don\u2019t go to school, hospitals are running out of life-saving equipment, we are facing a generational financial depression, and the funeral services that have traditionally allowed us at least to mourn together are being (rightfully) banned. Can we extrapolate the implications of a 60% death rate in our imaginations? That would be a 30-fold increase over our current situation. What if the next pandemic didn\u2019t spare children? The death rate for children infected with H5N1 approaches 50%. How does it feel if you imagine one person you love a coin toss away from a horrible death? Try imagining if half of everyone you know who had the flu last year was now dying. If you have children, how many of them had the flu last year? Force yourself to imagine these things then ask yourself: how much would it be worth sacrificing now to avoid that happening?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/07/industrial-sized-pig-and-chicken-farming-continuing-to-rise-in-uk\">Industrial-sized pig and chicken farming continuing to rise in UK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This leads to the most pertinent question: What can we do? The link between factory farming and increasing pandemic risk is well established scientifically, but the political will to curtail that risk has, in the past, been absent. Now is the time to build that will. It really does matter if we talk about this, share our concerns with our friends, explain these issues to our children, wonder together about how we should eat differently, call on our political leaders, and support advocacy organisations fighting factory farming. Leaders are listening. Changing the most powerful industrial complex in the world \u2013 the factory farm \u2013 could not possibly be easy, but in this moment with these stakes it is, maybe for the first time in our lifetimes, possible.</p> <p>The fact that we know our food system is partly to blame can empower us. We know how to strike at the single greatest risk factor for pandemics. We know how to make ourselves and our families safer. The very uncertainty that unsettles us also reminds us that everything can change for the better, too. Thankfully Covid-19 seems to attack our children extremely rarely, and if we respond with sufficient wisdom, this time that is so marked by death will perhaps also be remembered by them as a turning point, a time of reckoning, quiet heroism and, as the months pass, renewal.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jonathan Safran Foer is an author.

In fact, it\u2019s the quiet plainness with which the narrative unfolds that generates the emotional impact of O\u2019Donoghue\u2019s most successful poems. Discursiveness, too, may become a mode of generosity and empathy. Over its four, seven-line stanzas, Safe Houses is widely discursive, while keeping a secretly firm hold on the design. Slowly, satisfyingly, all the threads of narrative are shown to connect.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/27/lives-of-houses-review-the-enduring-appeal-of-writers-homes\">Lives of Houses review \u2013 the enduring appeal of writers' homes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It begins with the speaker confessing, neither in tones of self-mockery nor self-pity, an anxiety about losing house keys and being shut out because the door has suddenly been \u201ccaught by the wind\u201d. We might interpret this common anxiety as a perfectly rational one, but there\u2019s a metaphorical undertone to it. Everyone at some point in middle or later age becomes aware, with varying degrees of insouciant denial, of their mortality: we know we\u2019ll lose our earthly safe house, whether or not we pause first at the frightening staging-post of \u201ca home\u201d. This covert sense of impending loss isn\u2019t entirely quieted by the belt-and-braces remedies \u2013 the \u201cspare keys\u201d in \u201cseveral pockets\u201d . As the first stanza emphasises in its last line, there\u2019s a further, related anxiety for the old and single \u2013 being locked <em>inside </em>the house, beyond neighbourly help if it should be needed.</p> <p>The move in stanza two to a bigger, political context is easily accomplished by the shift of definition occasioned when \u201csafe houses\u201d loses its plural and becomes \u201csafe house\u201d. This second stanza quietly illuminates the underground code, moral as well as practical. Guerrillas change address \u201cto give their hosts a rest from listening / for the thump on the door in the early hours\u201d. A relationship between guerrilla tactics and ordinary folk going south on holiday appears somewhat oblique, but it forms a useful bridge to the next stanza\u2019s question: \u201cBut where do we retreat to in the end / when the call to open up will not subside?\u201d</p> <p>Synapses spark across the stanzas. The relentless door-rapping of the worried rescuers, an unstated but hovering scenario at the end of stanza one, and the early-morning \u201cthump\u201d of the state police in stanza two are both, however differently motivated, sounds of terror.</p> <p>And then, more than halfway through the poem\u2019s 28 lines, we meet Kate, \u201cin her nineties\u201d, now, it\u2019s delicately implied, suffering from dementia. When the narrator visits her in her care home, he\u2019s locked by the nurse into the day room with Kate and the other residents \u201cno longer fit / to mind\u201d themselves. Like the earlier knocking at the doors, the sounds evoked here are ominous, unhomely. The residents are talking in loud voices. They\u2019re not communicating with each other, though, but trying to make themselves heard by the \u201coutside world.\u201d</p> <p>Cultural references could misfire, or quench the fire, militating against the poem\u2019s immediacy. But they\u2019re managed here so as to intensify our sense of the tragic. The magpies in Dante\u2019s Purgatorio originate in Book V of Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses. They were once the Pierides, <a href=\"https://ovid.lib.virginia.edu/trans/Metamorph5.htm#479128845\">losers to the Muses in a song contest</a>, punished by being transformed into magpies. They can\u2019t sing any more, only chatter nosily and complain. Masaccio\u2019s fresco, <a href=\"http://www.italianrenaissance.org/masaccios-expulsion-of-adam-and-eve-from-eden/\">The Expulsion from Eden</a> (reproduced in the anthology), vividly conveys the unseemly haste of Adam and Eve\u2019s departure, as well as their utter grief and humiliation. O\u2019Donoghue refreshes a familiar narrative with both these allusions. He conveys the plight of the old whose speech goes unheard, and develops the emotional dimension of the Fall so as to emphasise the ignorance (a kind of innocence?) of Adam and Eve. Though devastated, they are still \u201cnot grasping what they\u2019ve been exiled from\u201d.</p> <p>The Garden of Eden at least held \u201csome corner\u201d, where the serpent\u2019s presence could have been avoided. Death wasn\u2019t part of the original plan: it wasn\u2019t inevitable. But now the couple have entered time, and the serpent is always with them. It\u2019s the moment when the poem whispers a memento mori to us, the readers. Only it\u2019s so tactfully done, we might not notice until a second reading. Then the door slams behind us. Then the shiver makes itself felt.</p> <ul> <li><p>Bernard O\u2019Donoghue\u2019s most recent collection is <a href=\"https://www.faber.co.uk/9780571330478-the-seasons-of-cullen-church.html\">The Seasons of Cullen Church</a>. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/lives-of-houses.html\">Lives of Houses</a>, the anthology from which this week\u2019s poem is taken, is out now.</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>The challenges facing the 21st-century career woman, those that existed before recent events at least, have been documented in newspapers and magazines, books, TV and film. On the one hand there\u2019s the inward-looking fulfilment to be found through work (this is not my opinion, by the way, I\u2019m just summarising the literature). On the other hand there\u2019s the outward-looking, selfless fulfilment of raising a child (what the men were doing, no one knows).</p> <p>It\u2019s a tough balance to strike, everyone acknowledged, almost impossible in fact. So add into the mix the fact of being an android, and having to engage in mortal combat with a legion of mercenaries and you can understand why Charlotte Hale is literally steaming come the end of this episode of WestWorld.</p> <p>Yes, the Delos boss has had it tough this week. Not to say that it was easy before. As well as running a company dedicated to bringing out the worst in humankind, she was also working as a corporate mole for the dastardly plutocrat Serac. Then she died, but that was hardly the end of it. Reanimated as a robot, she became a mole on behalf of Dolores against Serac, only for the Frenchman to rumble her and send his trusty goons a rat-a-tat-ing her way.</p> <p>But, hang on, there\u2019s even more. Despite being a host powered by a copy of Dolores\u2019s own control unit, Hale increasingly felt more sympatico with the human she\u2019s supposed to be pretending to be. Goodness knows how it works; there\u2019s a snatch of convo between Dolores and Hale suggesting some kind of accidentally uploaded emotions, and we\u2019ll have to go with that. But suffice to say, when it comes to the crunch, in the choice between fighting Serac for the sake of Delos\u2019s corporate values, or dashing off home to save her husband and kid, she plumped for the latter. Talk about having it all.</p> <p>Sadly for Hale all that went to waste. No sooner has she returned home and uttered the words: \u201cMummy\u2019s not going to let anything happen to you\u201d, than her squat little future car explodes into a ball of flames taking hubby and progeny with it. It\u2019s an act of murderous arson that has Serac written all over it. Despite the horrible intensity of it all, however, the explosion is not nearly enough to take out Hale herself. She crawls from the wreckage looking like a tanning salon disaster, but alive; her eyes spelling out \u2018\u2018revenge\u201d.</p> <p>As Hale crouches by the roadside, hot enough to fry an egg, Maeve is in Serac\u2019s laboratory waiting to print something out. Because this is Westworld, the print job is not a 32-page guide to performing essential maintenance on the Rohohohoboam, but an actual host, about to emerge from the mystical milk and help Maeve in her fight against Dolores.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf2068381a57a6bf61712f4fda2d4cb2be1bacd2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf2068381a57a6bf61712f4fda2d4cb2be1bacd2/204_28_1583_950/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Westworld\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maeve and Hector reunite.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maeve, you will recall, is on Team Serac, though the bond is hardly an unbreakable one given that the dastardly trillionaire has promised to deny her access to her daughter for eternity should she not do what she\u2019s told. Maeve spends much of this hour trying to get the gang back together for the big battle ahead. She returns to Warworld with some zingers about the necessity of foreplay and a lust for robot Nazi blood, before rallying poor deluded Hector and limping Lee Sizemore to her cause.</p> <p>Serac serves up one other character for Maeve to interact with and that\u2019s Dolores. In a reworking of all those interrogations Bernard used to make of big D in season one, Maeve quizzes a version of Dolores as to what she would do \u2013 just hypothetically speaking you understand \u2013 if she was determined to wage war on all humanity. The fake Dolores reveals that her first move would be to stop Maeve reassembling the aforementioned gang.</p> <p>Soon enough Hector has his control unit crushed by a rampaging Hale. And Sizemore is just a simulation, so he\u2019s useless. But judging by the smile on Maeve\u2019s mush, whatever\u2019s coming out of that host bath promises some useful help; whether it\u2019s a Teddy or a Clementine or maybe that Rebus dude whose muttonchops will stay with me till the grave.</p> <p>Speaking of the grave, William\u2019s still dodging it. Committed to an asylum the last time we saw him, we now find the erstwhile Man in Black being exposed to all kinds of Clockwork Orange/Marathon Man style brutality. Dressed in an all-white jumpsuit he endures some improvised dentistry (getting the same mind-bending braces fitted as Caleb) before being introduced to Dr Albert (how do they come up with these names?) who signs William up for a spot of aversion therapy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fba7f69914073be9b3d751076b8ccd037b0580b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fba7f69914073be9b3d751076b8ccd037b0580b6/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Westworld\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Mullan returns to torment William.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The problem with William\u2019s aversion, is that it\u2019s for himself. He absolutely loathes William, does William. Dr Albert\u2019s recommended course of treatment, therefore, is that he should sit in a room with several different versions of himself (and good old Daddy Delos to boot) and collectively thrash out their problems. Of course, William being William, the thrashings are literal and after a debate over nature versus nurture \u2013 did William\u2019s alcoholic Dad make William bad or did Bad William make his dad alcoholic? \u2013 William beats all his variant selves to death with his bare hands. No damage done though. The therapy turns out to have been all in the mind and Bernard, displaying once again his uncanny ability to turn up in the precise place where the plot needs him, detaches William from his nightmare.</p> <p>So with two episodes left in the season, Bernard is in the saddle with the Man in Black, Maeve is down the robot dairy and Hale is best served with a tomato relish. Serac meanwhile is beaming holographic versions of himself into any number of boardrooms as he looks to reassert control over the future of us all and put an end to these pesky hosts. Caleb, well, we all hope he has come down off his Genre by now and as for Dolores it\u2019s all up in the air, quite literally guys. See you next week!</p> <h2>Divergence and anomalies</h2> <p>\u2022 No popular chart music played on a violin this week, what\u2019s up with that?</p> <p>\u2022 Last week I read that driverless plastic tubs were <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-46045365\">delivering fast food in Milton Keynes</a>. A week later and futuristic gardeners are using them to get rid of dead bodies. I have to say, this trajectory does have an air of plausibility to it.</p> <p>\u2022 When precisely did Hale find the time in her busy schedule to secrete poison gas in the Delos boardroom?</p> <p>\u2022 Good to see one of those riot robots get an outing. All that money spend and it would have been a shame not to see them go smash something up Transformers-style.</p>",
  "<h2>The album to start with</h2> <p><strong>Nina Simone in Concert (1964)<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/19/nina-simone-home-national-treasure-north-carolina-recognition-legacy\">Nina Simone</a> is in the unusual position of being a towering genius who never recorded an undeniable, canonical masterpiece. If you choose your 10 favourite songs, there\u2019s a good chance that they\u2019ll be from 10 different albums, which makes one of the many excellent compilations the natural gateway into a vast body of work that encompasses jazz, blues, folk, soul, pop, rock, show tunes, polyrhythms and songs that don\u2019t even have genres.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tHYGfRot5w\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4tHYGfRot5w?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>That said, In Concert, recorded at three Carnegie Hall shows during March and April 1964, represents her great leap forward as both a performer and activist: her escape from the \u201cnothing world\u201d of pop. She performs three songs from her jazzy 1959 debut Little Girl Blue with a newfound depth, drawn from painful personal experience and her recent political awakening at the hands of new friends in the civil rights movement, notably Lorraine Hansberry and James Baldwin. It\u2019s this nightcrawling version of Jack Hammer\u2019s Plain Gold Ring that explains why Nick Cave later covered it, while Don\u2019t Smoke in Bed is so stark that you can hear audience members shifting in their seats.</p> <p>Unlike most live albums, In Concert leaves the audience in the mix throughout and illustrates how deftly Simone could snap between tension and release. Summoning the vengeful ghost of Brecht and Weill\u2019s Pirate Jenny into the age of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/12/medgar-evers-civil-rights\">Medgar Evers</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Wallace\">George Wallace</a>, she stuns the room into a silence punctuated only by nervous coughs. During Go Limp, a kind of protester\u2019s sex comedy written by CND campaigner Alex \u201cThe Joy of Sex\u201d Comfort, the spectators chortle at the jokes, join in the goofy chorus and keep Simone airborne when she forgets the lyrics. The laughter carries into her own Mississippi Goddam \u2013 written in a frenzy hours after the 1963 Alabama church bombing \u2013 until the show-tune irony is burned away by a mounting rage that consumes the hall and you can hear in real time the realisation that they are listening to a protest song like none they\u2019ve ever heard, owing more to cabaret than folk, and more to Malcolm X than Martin Luther King. Simone is fully aware of the power she wields: \u201cBetcha thought I was kidding, didn\u2019t you?\u201d The final standing ovation is an explosion of awe and relief. Oh, to have been in that room.</p> <h2>The three to check out next</h2> <p><strong>Wild </strong><strong>Is the Wind (1966)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=an140Nj_KIo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/an140Nj_KIo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Starting with I Put a Spell on You in 1965, you can\u2019t go wrong with Simone\u2019s final five albums for Philips Records. Despite being largely pieced together from leftover sessions by producer Hal Mooney, Wild Is the Wind is the strongest illustration of her uncanny ability to find the song within a song, revealing the secret tunnels and caverns that previous singers didn\u2019t know existed and future interpreters couldn\u2019t ignore. When Jeff Buckley covered the gloomy torch song Lilac Wine, he was really covering Simone\u2019s version, which also happens to be one of Thom Yorke\u2019s Desert Island Discs. Likewise, it was Simone who showed David Bowie that Johnny Mathis\u2019s Wild is the Wind could be a shattering tour de force. Simone\u2019s own Four Women, a quadripartite study of black womanhood so unflinching in its pain and outrage that some black radio stations banned it, epitomises her talent for<strong> </strong>inhabiting characters with her voice.<strong> </strong>It is practically a seance: each mistreated woman is sketched in just a few short lines but she lives and breathes and cries out for justice.</p> <p><strong>Nina Simone and Piano!

The other was its polar opposite: Simone alone with the instrument she learned as a child. Her most intimate and auteurish album (she handled the occasional embellishments and overdubs as well) weaves diverse material into a coherent suite of songs haunted by loneliness, depression and mortality. She makes Randy Newman\u2019s I Think It\u2019s Going to Rain Today bleaker still (\u201cI <em>hope</em> it\u2019s gonna rain today\u201d), delivers Jacques Brel\u2019s The Desperate Ones in a fraught whisper, rewrites the blues standard Nobody\u2019s Fault But Mine and even renders Jonathan King\u2019s mawkish Everyone\u2019s Gone to the Moon unnervingly strange. Never has an exclamation mark been more inappropriate. This is a companion for the wee small hours.</p> <p><strong>Emergency Ward!

Her last heavyweight artistic statement began at a show near Fort Dix, New Jersey, for Jane Fonda\u2019s anti-war Free the Army tour in November 1971. George Harrison\u2019s My Sweet Lord is a warm breeze but she whips it into a gospel hurricane and merges it with the Last Poets\u2019 David Nelson\u2019s biting poem Today Is a Killer, so that hope battles with despair on a cosmic scale. Running to almost 19 minutes, the medley is the most staggering spiritual crisis you will ever hear, whipped towards a chilling climax that brings the two strands together: \u201cToday, who are you Lord?

  "<p>The US Environmental Protection Agency is due in federal court on Tuesday to <a href=\"https://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/files/2019-08-13-dkt-35--petitioners-opening-brief_63858.pdf\">answer allegations</a> that it broke the law to support a Monsanto system that has triggered \u201cwidespread\u201d crop damage over the last few summers and continues to threaten farms across the country.</p> <p>As farmers prepare to plant a new season of key American food crops, farmer and consumer groups are asking the ninth circuit court of appeals in San Francisco to review and overturn the EPA\u2019s approval of a Monsanto herbicide made with a chemical called dicamba.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/monsanto-crop-system-damage-us-farms-documents\">Revealed: Monsanto predicted crop system would damage US farms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The allegations are from the National Family Farm Coalition, which represents tens of thousands of farmers across the US, and three non-profit consumer and environmental groups. They have been granted an expedited review of their legal petition and hope for a ruling that would block use of the herbicide this summer.</p> <p>The court hearing, which is to be handled by phone due to the coronavirus closing of California courthouses, comes just a month after the office of inspector general for the EPA said it would <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2020-04/documents/_epaoig_notificationmemo_4-3-20_dicamba-tolerant.pdf\">open an investigation</a> into the agency\u2019s handling of dicamba herbicides.</p> <p>Farmers have reported dicamba damage in both organic and conventional crops, including non-GMO soybeans, wheat, grapes, melons, vegetables and tobacco. A Missouri peach farmer won a $265m verdict in February against Monsanto and German chemical giant BASF after accusing the companies of creating a \u201cdefective\u201d crop system that damaged 30,000 peach trees.</p> <p>The Guardian reported last month that internal Monsanto documents obtained through the peach farmer litigation revealed that Monsanto <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/monsanto-crop-system-damage-us-farms-documents\">predicted its dicamba crop system</a> would lead to thousands of damage claims from US farmers but pushed ahead anyway, trying to downplay the risks to the EPA.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had millions of acres impacted,\u201d said George Kimbrell, a lawyer with the Center for Food Safety, which is one of the environmental groups seeking court review of the EPA, alongside the Center for Biological Diversity and Pesticide Action Network.</p> <p>Kimbrell said: \u201cThey decided to make farmers part of an ongoing experiment. The dicamba problem is unprecedented.\u201d</p> <h2>EPA approval</h2> <p>The crop system in question was developed by Monsanto with help from BASF to encourage farmers to buy dicamba herbicides and spray them over the top of new genetically engineered soybean and cotton crops developed by Monsanto to tolerate dicamba. The altered crops survive dicamba spray but weeds die, making it easier for farmers to eradicate weeds resistant to other herbicides such as Monsanto\u2019s glyphosate.</p> <p>Before the introduction of Monsanto\u2019s dicamba-tolerant cotton in 2015 and soybeans in 2016, farmers were largely restricted from using dicamba during the growing season because the chemical can easily drift and vaporize, traveling long distances from where it is sprayed. But the release of the new dicamba-tolerant crops upended that restraint and the EPA subsequently approved \u201cnew use\u201d dicamba products sold by Monsanto, BASF and Corteva Agriscience for treating fields planted with the genetically engineered cotton and soybeans.</p> <p>The companies said their herbicides would have low volatility and if farmers followed instructions on the product labels, they could prevent drift. But since the introduction of the new dicamba-tolerant soybeans and cotton, drift and volatilization has killed or injured a variety of crops, fruit trees and other plants across several millions acres.</p> <h2><strong>Costs to farmers</strong></h2> <p>The consumer and environmental groups claim the EPA violated federal law by failing to analyze the \u201csignificant socioeconomic and agronomic costs to farmers\u201d and not relying on adequate data in its approvals of the herbicides. The damage over the last few summer seasons has been \u201ccatastrophic\u201d they claim.</p> <p>The groups cite <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Vol-1-National-Family-Farm-discovery-dox-EPA-Copy.pdf\">government documents</a> they say show that the EPA itself has downplayed or ignored warnings from state agricultural officials and farmer pleas for protection from dicamba drift. Instead the agency has worked closely with Monsanto to keep the company\u2019s dicamba herbicide, called XtendiMax, on the market<a href=\"https://biologicaldiversity.org/w/news/press-releases/farmers-conservationists-challenge-approval-of-monsantos-crop-damaging-dicamba-pesticide-2019-08-14/\">, they say</a>.</p> <p>Documents filed in court show Monsanto met multiple times with EPA officials about the concerns, even <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EPA-2017-exchanges-with-Monsanto-no-surprises-comment.pdf\">editing EPA language</a> about certain steps Monsanto should take in communications with retailers. In an October 2017 email, an EPA official forwarded a Monsanto official comments from the agency regarding the company\u2019s product label, writing: \u201c<a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EPA-2017-exchanges-with-Monsanto-no-surprises-comment.pdf\">Like I said, no surprises.\u201d</a></p> <p>While the EPA worked with Monsanto, the records show the agency was well aware of the extent of crop damage being reported to multiple states. <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Arkansas-honeybees-and-Dicamba-from-Coys-Honey-Farm.pdf\">In a June 2018 email</a> an Arkansas bee keeper said dicamba had caused a 50% reduction in his honey production, and a July 2018 email from a Kansas Department of Agriculture supervisor told the EPA the department had been \u201c<a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Duane-Simon-over-run-with-dicamba-complaints-in-Kansas.pdf\">overrun with dicamba complaints</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Monsanto, which was bought by Bayer AG in 2018, said the claims raised by the farm coalition and other<strong> </strong>petitioners are \u201cbaseless\u201d and the company \u201cstands fully behind\u201d its product.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe the extensive body of science supporting the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\u2019s registration decision will ultimately determine the outcome,\u201d said Bayer spokesman Chris Loder. Monsanto has filed as an intervenor in the case.</p> <p>For its part, BASF said dicamba herbicides are \u201ccritically important tools for growers\u201d and said the company is providing training to dicamba applicators and is working with academics and state and federal agencies to address concerns.</p> <p>Corteva declined to comment.</p> <p>Despite the outcry over dicamba damage, in November 2018 the EPA granted a two-year extension for the dicamba herbicides for use over the dicamba-tolerant cotton and soybeans. That registration expires on 20 December and the agency is currently considering whether or not to further extend approval.</p> <p>In the meantime, the EPA said it was working with states and with the companies selling the dicamba herbicides to \u201cbetter understand the issue\u201d to enable it to deal with \u201cthe problem of illegal drift\u201d.</p> <p>The EPA also insists that it is not certain what is causing the crop damage.</p> <p>\u201cThe underlying causes of the various damage incidents are not yet clear, as ongoing investigations have yet to be concluded,\u201d the agency told the Guardian.</p> <ul> <li><p>Carey Gillam tweets at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/careygillam?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@careygillam</a></p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Good evening, this is Calla Wahlquist bringing you the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia on Monday 20 April.</p> \n<h2>Lowest increase since March</h2> \n<p>Australia has recorded its lowest daily increase in cases since early March.</p> \n<p>Three states \u2013 Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia \u2013 have recorded no new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours.</p> \n<p>Victoria recorded just one new case overnight, while New South Wales recorded six new cases, the lowest daily total in five weeks. The Australian Capital Territory recorded one new case.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s the third day in a row that South Australia recorded no new cases. The state\u2019s chief public health officer, associate professor Nicola Spurrier, said that result came on the back of increased testing. Almost 5,000 people were tested over the past five days.</p> \n<p>Both South Australia and Queensland said if results remained that strong, they would begin considering lifting restrictions.</p> \n<p>The national total increased by just 26 cases. That seems to comprise mainly of 16 new cases among crew members aboard the Ruby Princess cruise ship, which were not included in NSW\u2019s daily totals. A total of 202 crew members on the ship, which is moored at Port Kembla, have now tested positive to Covid-19.</p> \n<h2>Virgin Australia goes into administration</h2> \n<p>Accounting firm Deloitte is understood to have been appointed the administrators for Virgin Australia, which has collapsed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/20/queensland-nsw-fight-headquarters-virgin-australia-if-it-survives\">despite competing offers of rescue packages from the Queensland and NSW state governments.</a></p> \n<p>It comes after the Australian government refused the airline\u2019s request for a $1.4bn emergency loan. It\u2019s not clear what this development will mean for the airline\u2019s 10,000 staff or 130 planes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian Australia coronavirus email signup button\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Facebook and Google forced to share advertising revenue</h2> \n<p>The Australian government has announced it will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/19/facebook-and-google-to-be-forced-to-share-advertising-revenue-with-australian-media-companies\">impose a mandatory code of conduct on tech companies Facebook and Google</a> that will force them to share advertising revenue with Australian media companies.</p> \n<p>Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the code, which will include penalties and binding dispute resolution mechanisms, will \u201ccreate a level playing field\u201d between media companies and the two tech giants.</p> \n<h2>Privacy concerns remain over coronavirus app</h2> \n<p>Digital experts have called on the federal government to formally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/privacy-concerns-persist-over-australias-coronavirus-tracing-app\">make data collected by its coronavirus tracking app exempt from use by law enforcement.</a></p> \n<p>And the Law Council of Australia has said that the public health benefits of the app need to be balanced with the privacy implications. </p> \n<p>Government services minister Stuart Robert said on Monday that the information collected by the app, which is intended to register when people have been standing near another person for more than 15 minutes, can be used in contact tracing for a potential Covid-19 infection, will \u201callow us to get back to life quicker\u201d.</p> \n<h2>NRL chief executive quits</h2> \n<p>Todd Greenberg, the chief executive of the NRL, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/20/nrl-ceo-todd-greenberg-quits-amid-rugby-league-coronavirus-crisis\">resigned his post effective immediately</a>, in the latest blow to a league that has struggled financially since the shutdown of the 2020 season due to the coronavirus.</p> \n<p>In a shock announcement on Monday, Greenberg said he and the league had come to a mutual agreement to part ways. Chief commercial officer Andrew Abdo will take over the role on an interim basis until a replacement CEO is found.</p> \n<p>Greenberg said it had been a \u201cgreat honour and privilege to be the CEO of the NRL for the last four years\u201d.</p> \n<h2>Unemployment rate could hit 16%</h2> \n<p>Australia\u2019s unemployment rate could rise as high as 16% over the next few months due to the continued economic impact of the coronavirus, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/lower-income-earners-more-likely-to-lose-jobs-due-to-coronavirus\">according to a report by the Grattan Institute.</a></p> \n<p>The report said that between 17% and 28% of Australian workers, or 2.2 million to 3.6 million people, are either out of work now could be out of work in the coming weeks and months as a direct result of social distancing laws introduced in March. The jobseeker scheme will keep the official unemployment rate lower.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Elective surgery could resume within the month</h2> \n<p>Rules preventing non-urgent elective surgery <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/20/australia-coronavirus-live-news-nsw-victoria-qld-contact-tracing-app-schools-exit-strategy-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9d317f8f08bade1f2964ae#block-5e9d317f8f08bade1f2964ae\">could be lifted within the month</a>, the federal deputy chief health officer Nick Coatsworth said.</p> \n<p>The issue was discussed by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee on Monday and will be considered at a national cabinet meeting on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are Australians out there who are in pain and have disability, cannot be in the workforce, they need to take very potent pain medication and they need their elective surgery done,\u201d Coatsworth said.</p> \n<p>What you need to know: get the most important information from some of our key explainers</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/australias-coronavirus-lockdown-rules-explained-can-i-still-visit-my-partner-and-other-questions\">Australia\u2019s coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/mar/26/how-many-cases-of-coronavirus-are-there-in-australia-live-covid-19-numbers-and-statistics\">Coronavirus Australia maps and cases: live numbers and statistics</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/03/social-distancing-rules-australia-coronavirus-strict-new-laws-legal-illegal-state-physical-restrictions-guidelines-explained-nsw-victoria-qld-queensland-act-sa-wa-two-person-rule\">Australia\u2019s strict new coronavirus social distancing rules explained: state by state guidelines</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/free-childcare-what-do-the-governments-coronavirus-changes-mean-for-my-family\">Free childcare: what do the Australian government\u2019s coronavirus changes mean for my family?</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/01/jobkeeper-payment-am-i-eligible-for-the-wage-subsidy-how-do-i-register-ato-jobseeker-supplement-support-package-eligibility\">Am I eligible for the jobkeeper payment?

  "<p>It\u2019s a classic case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Back to the Future was released in 1985, four years before I was born, and my early film education consisted of Disney, then Harry Potter, and then any and every <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/08/love-is-still-in-the-air-why-the-romcom-has-come-back-from-the-dead\">romantic comedy</a>. It wasn\u2019t until my final years at school and my decision to study French at university that my cinematic horizons expanded. Following my teacher\u2019s encouragement, I watched Truffaut\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/may/11/francoistruffaut.worldcinema\">Jules et Jim</a> and The 400 Blows, the Three Colours trilogy, Am\u00e9lie and Delicatessen. I even branched out into Spanish (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/apr/12/1\">Y Tu Mam\u00e1</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/apr/12/1\"> Tambi</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/apr/12/1\">\u00e9n</a>, Volver, Amores Perros) and a touch of German (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/apr/13/worldcinema.drama\">The Lives of Others</a>). Unless it was set in Hogwarts or Middle Earth, any type of adventure, sci-fi or fantasy film just didn\u2019t appeal to me.</p> <p>But what better time to rectify that than during a nationwide lockdown? I think I\u2019ll enjoy Back to the Future. After all, I know a few things about it already. I know that a young Michael J Fox gets involved in time travel with an eccentric scientist and things, as you\u2019d imagine, start to go wrong. I\u2019m aware that there\u2019s also something about hoverboards, because every once in a while people complain that we were promised we\u2019d have them by now. And I know that Fox\u2019s character, Marty McFly, inspired the naming of a noughties pop band \u2013 but thankfully, I\u2019ve never seen them, either.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb7Fd0l_BRo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qb7Fd0l_BRo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb7Fd0l_BRo\">Watch the trailer for Back to the Future</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>As it turns out, I do enjoy Back to the Future. I really, really enjoy it. I chuckle all the way through. I\u2019m entertained, enraptured and squawk gleefully when that famous final line is delivered: \u201cRoads? Where we\u2019re going, we don\u2019t need roads.\u201d So <em>that\u2019s </em>where that saying comes from, I shriek.</p> <p>For me, the joy of Back to the Future is the almost Shakespearean absurdity that forced my brain to keep up with the constant misunderstandings, to process the chicken-and-egg scenarios, and complete the many pop culture references that fail to land in 1950s Hill Valley. There\u2019s also the untold repercussions to reckon with: what if Marty can\u2019t deflect his mother\u2019s advances on to his father, thus ensuring he has a future to go back to? The meta-mania is mind-bending.</p> <p>I loved Doc\u2019s reaction to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/jun/07/guardianobituaries.past\">Ronald Reagan</a>\u2019s presidency, and thought that if I could travel back to 2003 and tell anyone that the host of the US Apprentice is now the leader of the free world, they\u2019d likely respond in exactly the same way. I also adored the briefest of moments where, in the 1955 school canteen, Marty is finally able to relate to his father about the insecurities they both feel about their creativity \u2013 even if it\u2019s not completely reciprocated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61bacdf788346c954a20409d8291a6a06b4e3a47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61bacdf788346c954a20409d8291a6a06b4e3a47/0_87_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson as Michael J Fox\u2019s parents in Back to the Future.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Family ties \u2026 Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson as Michael J Fox\u2019s parents in Back to the Future.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Universal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But there is one element of the film that doesn\u2019t sit well \u2013 that Marty, essentially, is ashamed of his family; his timid father, his alcoholic mother, lazy brother and whiny sister. Only by accidentally travelling into the past and altering the start of his parents\u2019 relationship is his family happy and successful, and does Marty get the home life he feels he deserves.</p> <p>To really drill down into this, it\u2019s somewhat heartbreaking that in neither reality do his parents fall in love simply by knowing each other. There has to be some sort of catalytic event to force the two together, whether that\u2019s by the father being hit by a car and cared for by the mother or \u2013 as in the second reality where they end up happier, richer and more in love \u2013 by the father saving the mother from an horrific and traumatic sexual assault. It\u2019s a strange message for a family film.</p> <p>In the end, Back to the Future leaves me with many unanswered questions \u2013 not about plot holes, exactly, but about the infinite loop created when you mess about with the time-space continuum. When did Doc and McFly actually first meet? What happens to Einstein the dog? When did Doc actually invent time travel? If time travel ever really catches on, will we still be in control of our own thoughts and actions, or will they be dictated by future versions of ourselves who have gone back to the past? Could time travel eradicate our free will?</p> <p>Forgive me, I\u2019ve been inside for a long time.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/chris-hemsworth\">Chris Hemsworth</a> has a tough mission in the new Netflix movie Extraction: his world-weary but well-groomed mercenary must rescue the son of an Indian drug baron. He is not explicitly told to shoot as many people in the face as possible in the process, but he throws that in for free. Offscreen, Extraction serves as an even tougher mission for Hemsworth. Think of the Australian hunk and you probably think \u201cThor\u201d (possibly followed by \u201cPhwoar!\u201d). He has spent a good decade playing the Marvel god and little else (the less said about Men in Black: International the better). Without the cape and the hammer, will audiences stay interested? Or will they just think: \u201cWhy is Thor shooting everybody in the face now?\u201d</p> <p>This is a test that many retired superheroes are facing post-Avengers. Film-makers, too. Extraction is very much a Marvel-alumni project. Its producers are Joe and Anthony Russo, directors of the last two Avengers movies (Joe adapted the screenplay, too). The director is Sam Hargrave, formerly a stunt coordinator on Marvel movies. The Russos already tested these waters last November with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/24/21-bridges-review-chadwick-boseman-sienna-miller\">21 Bridges</a>, a police thriller starring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/chadwick-boseman\">Chadwick Boseman</a>, AKA <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/06/black-panther-review-marvel-wakanda-chadwick-boseman\">Black Panther</a>. Boseman isn\u2019t quite so tethered to his alter ego as Hemsworth, and 21 Bridges was a decent movie, but it didn\u2019t find much of an audience in a box office crowded out by Oscar contenders and blockbusters.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6P3nI6VnlY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L6P3nI6VnlY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>A more worrying indicator is the fate of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/robertdowneyjr\">Robert Downey Jr</a>. Stepping out of his Iron Man suit after a decade, Downey went big. This year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/07/dolittle-review-robert-downey-jr\">Dolittle</a> was a broad spectrum, bells-and-whistles extravaganza, and it bombed spectacularly. Was that down to Downey\u2019s diminished star power or his ropey Welsh accent? We\u2019ll never know, but it\u2019s sure looking cold out there.</p> <p>Some are taking a more cautious approach: Chris Evans was part of a large ensemble in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/01/knives-out-review-rian-johnson-superior-whodunnit-agatha-christie\">Knives Out</a>. Others have chosen to remain in the Marvel fold, hence Disney+\u2019s forthcoming series WandaVision, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Loki, and Hawkeye \u2013 all featuring the original actors from the movies. The only major figure to have bucked the trend seems to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/scarlettjohansson\">Scarlett Johansson</a>, who moved on from Avengers to two Oscar-nominated roles last year (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/15/marriage-story-review-noah-baumbach-adam-driver-scarlett-johansson\">Marriage Story</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/05/jojo-rabbit-review-taika-waititi-hitler-scarlett-johansson-sam-rockwell\">Jo</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/05/jojo-rabbit-review-taika-waititi-hitler-scarlett-johansson-sam-rockwell\">jo Rabbit</a>). Then again, she still has her solo Black Widow movie to come, so it\u2019s too soon to say whether she has really escaped the curse.</p> <p>As for Hemsworth, he has another Thor movie in the pipeline: Love and Thunder, due 2022 (and co-starring his erstwhile co-Man in Black, Tessa Thompson). So whatever happens with Extraction, he should be all right. But many actors who assumed a superhero gig would be a springboard for their careers must be wondering if they\u2019re not more of a final destination. </p> <p><em>Extraction is available on Netflix from Friday 24 April</em></p>",

  "<p><strong>I was in Suffolk for </strong><strong>a weekend in March, just before the lockdown, and I needed to buy a rail ticket to get home to London, which I did online via Trainline. I bought a return for outward travel on the Monday morning for \u00a315.50 with a 26\u201330 railcard \u2013 in the (wildly optimistic) expectation that I might be returning again within the month. But I didn\u2019t realise I had got the two legs of the journey mixed up, so what I thought was my outward bound ticket on that day was actually the return portion. I had hoped to explain to a member of staff on the train that I made a mistake, but no one came round to check (apparently due to the coronavirus restrictions). By the time I arrived at Liverpool Street station my phone had died and I couldn\u2019t present a valid ticket to the staff on the gate.</strong></p> <p><strong>I explained I had accidentally bought the wrong ticket, but to my </strong><strong>surprise the Greater Anglia/Abellio staff member </strong><strong>handed me a penalty fare</strong><strong>, with a potential charge of \u00a396.40.

  "<p>Each night, Bipul* is kept awake by the fear of loan sharks hounding his parents for the money he owes. Five months ago, the 25-year-old Sri Lankan borrowed $1,400 (\u00a31,120) to pay recruiters to take him to the United Arab Emirates, where he got a job as cleaner at a five-star hotel. But since the coronavirus outbreak there are no longer any guests, so he no longer has work and the loan is going unpaid.</p> <p>\u201cI really need a job so I can repay it,\u201d he says. \u201cI also need to earn money to help my family. This is such a big problem.\u201d</p> <p>Bipul was earning AED 1,000 (\u00a3218) per month, working up to 11 hours a day, six days a week at the Pullman Hotel in Sharjah, which is managed by Accor, a French firm that owns several upscale international hotel chains.</p> <p>Bipul\u2019s final salary instalment and passport are being held by the company until flight restrictions are lifted and he can be put on a plane home, he says. Sending most of his earnings to Sri Lanka and living paycheque to paycheque, he is now stranded and penniless.</p> <p>Dulhara*, a Nepali in his 20s, is struggling to pay $2,500 of debts he incurred with Nepalese recruitment brokers who brought him to the UAE last year. Until he was placed at a job with Accor, the brokers made him live in a room with more than 20 other men, where he slept on a mattress on the floor and was given insufficient food. After that ordeal, he was desperate for life to improve.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m trapped,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel so sad and angry. But what can I do?\u201d</p> <p>The UAE is on lockdown and most hotels are shut, leaving very low paid migrant workers \u2013 mainly employed in the tourism, hospitality and construction sectors \u2013 stranded in the country with no prospect of earning. The Emirati government has allowed some repatriation flights for Asian migrant workers left jobless by the pandemic. However, some countries have refused to allow their citizens home, citing concerns over possible disease transmission, leaving workers struggling to survive without funds.</p> <p>\u201cThese are worrying reports. Given the already vulnerable position of migrant workers in the UAE, abrupt redundancies are likely to have a devastating effect,\u201d says May Romanos, Amnesty International\u2019s Gulf migrant rights\u2019 researcher. </p> <p>In accordance with UAE law, Accor is still providing its blue-collar migrant workers with food and accommodation. But in addition to their worry over debt, both Bipul and Dulhara say they are increasingly frightened their families back home will find paying for food difficult now they can\u2019t send money.</p> <p>\u201cNo redundancies have been made at Pullman Sharjah and Marjan Island Resort &amp; Spa as a result of the possible impact that Covid-19 is having on business levels,\u201d said Accor in a statement.

Vanessa Teague, the chief executive of Thinking Cybersecurity and an adjunct professor at the Australian National University, said until the source code was released \u2013 and the government formally made it inaccessible to law enforcement \u2013 there would still be concerns.</p> <p>\u201cThe minister is saying it won\u2019t track your location and that the source code will be openly available, which are both good things that I\u2019m very strongly in favour of, but it\u2019s one thing to say \u2018we\u2019re going to give you that information\u2019 and it\u2019s another thing to give it to us.\u201d</p> <p>She said the \u201ccentralised\u201d model proposed by the government, which would mean officials would de-encrypt contact information on the basis of a positive Covid-19 result, \u201cinevitably means the authorities are getting a complete list of your contacts\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOne thing I really want to be clarified is, if we are using this trace model, how easy is it to omit certain contacts or turn off the logging feature if you choose to not relay the fact you\u2019ve been in contact with certain people?</p> <p>\u201cThe second is, how does that interact with other existing surveillance laws? So for example the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/15/high-court-rules-afp-warrant-for-raid-on-news-corp-journalists-home-was-invalid\">laws used against a journalist recently means that under certain circumstances a police officer can demand access to your phone</a>. If your phone has an in-built list of everyone you\u2019ve been near in the last two weeks, will that be excluded from our existing laws?\u201d</p> <p>Experts such as Teague argue the government should instead use a \u201cdecentralised\u201d version of the app, where instead of health authorities gaining access to a person\u2019s encrypted data if they test positive, the app notifies people automatically if they are a close contact of someone who has tested positive. Similar apps based on this design <a href=\"https://www.covid-watch.org/\">are already being developed</a>.</p> <p>Other experts have questioned how effective the app would be, and have said its use should not be tied to a rolling back of lockdown laws. Both Robert and the prime minister, Scott Morrison, have said they want 40% of the population to download the app to make it effective.</p> <p>Hassan Asghar, a lecturer in computing at Macquarie University, said even if the government reached that target it was wrong to explicitly link the two things. </p> <p>\u201cThere is no guarantee it\u2019s going to be that effective in reducing the virus that the lockdown can end \u2013 countries like Singapore and South Korea have used similar technology and still have lockdown measures there,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a way to come out of lockdown, it\u2019s more like a support for whatever contact tracing processes they are already using.\u201d</p> <p>He said a low uptake on the app would make its usefulness very limited.</p> <p>\u201cUsing a very simple scenario it\u2019s only going to be 100% useful if all my friends and family members and everyone I come in close contact with also install it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe more users you have, obviously the better your results. You could say OK, at least if one of my close contacts is using it that would make it faster for the authorities to be able to contact trace that person. You can say that\u2019s better than nothing. But it is also kind of tracing your movements so, you know, what\u2019s better?\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

A few hours ago the president \u2013 at what was supposed to be a coronavirus task force briefing \u2013 broadcast two <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/trump-plays-misleading-clips-of-support-from-cuomo-at-coronavirus-briefing\">selectively edited and somewhat out of date videos</a> featuring the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, appearing to shower him with praise. In fact, two days ago Cuomo eviscerated Trump in scathing 15-minute remarks for \u201csitting home watching TV\u201d during the crisis and placing emotion, politics and \u201cpersonal ego\u201d ahead of doing his job.</p> \n<p>The heads of all the UN\u2019s major agencies have warned of the risk of coronavirus to the world\u2019s most vulnerable countries after disclosing that international donors have pledged around a quarter of the $2bn the UN requested for its emergency Covid-19 response.

The price of US crude oil plunged almost 20%, to below $15, in early trading on Monday \u2013 its lowest point since 1999 \u2013 as stockpiles continued to build owing to a crash in demand caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> \n<p>It is predicted British households will have \u00a343bn less cash available for essential spending between April and June, as the UK slides into its deepest recession in decades.

  "<p>New Zealanders will remain in total lockdown until 27 April prime minister Jacinda Ardern has said, with restrictions easing if elimination progress is maintained.</p> \n<p>Speaking at the Beehive in Wellington, Ardern said New Zealand was in with a fighting chance of eliminating the disease, and the number of deaths was low enough that she still received a phone call for each one.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have done what very few countries have been able to do. We have stopped a wave of devastation,\u201d Ardern said.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur transmission rate, the number of cases each person with the virus passes it onto, is now 0.48, less than half a person each. Overseas the average is 2.5 people. We have amongst the lowest number of confirmed cases per 100,000 people in the world.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/debate-over-when-and-how-to-ease-new-zealands-lockdown-turns-personal\">Debate over when and how to ease New Zealand's lockdown turns personal</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The prime minister said New Zealand had a \u201crelatively low proportion of serious cases\u201d, and according to the Oxford University coronavirus government response tracker, one of the lowest mortality rates in the world.</p> \n<p>Overall 1,400 people have become infected with coronavirus in New Zealand, and 12 people have died, all older people with pre-existing health conditions. On Monday, nine new cases were confirmed by the Ministry of Health, but random testing of 1,000 people in the community had returned no positive results.</p> \n<p>\u201cNearly every case identified since April 1 is as a result of overseas travel or contact with someone with the virus, often in existing clusters,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cOur testing has scaled up and we have now tested over 85,000 New Zealanders, one of the highest testing rates per capita in the world.\u201d</p> \n<p>The director-general of health, Dr Ashley Bloomfield, said he was confident community transmission of the virus has not taken hold, but he, and other experts advising the government, had urged them to extend the level four lockdown, to be \u201cextra safe\u201d and solidify the gains already made in lowering infection rates.</p> \n<p>The government\u2019s decision to conditionally ease restrictions from next Monday night has taken a middle path between those urging an immediate end to lockdown for the sake of the gasping economy, and those urging an extension to give the elimination strategy a fighting chance.</p> \n<p>Moving to level three overnight on Monday 27 April would see many more businesses able to trade, including those involved in takeaways and food deliveries, the construction sector and the forestry sector. The move to level three would have significant benefits for the economy, Ardern said.</p> \n<p>Social lives would largely be unchanged however, with Kiwis still urged to remain at home unless taking exercise or fetching supplies. \u201cBubbles\u201d could be marginally expanded, however, to include close family or those who might be alone or isolated in the community, she said. Schools would be open, but students should remain at home, if they could.</p> \n<p>Cabinet would make a decision whether level three lockdown would move to two on 11 May.</p> \n<p>New Zealand entered lockdown on 25 March, when there were fewer than 150 cases of the virus and no deaths.</p> \n<p>Lockdown has been widely complied with countrywide, despite stringent regulations, which have dictated Kiwis stay in their homes around the clock unless shopping for essentials such as food or medicine, or taking a brief respite of exercise within their neighbourhood.</p> \n<p>The first two weeks of lockdown saw widespread confusion as to what and wasn\u2019t permitted, and the health minister David Clark was demoted after flouting the rules and taking his family to a beach 20km from their home.</p> \n<p>There have been some isolated reports of lockdown parties, but overall police have praised Kiwis adherence to the rules.</p> \n<p>New Zealand is pursuing an elimination strategy and is one of few worldwide to do so, but has advantages in being able to completely shut down its borders, having a small number of cases, and cities that are not so densely packed as the likes of New York and London.</p> \n<p>Epidemiologists working on New Zealand\u2019s Covid-15 strategy <a href=\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/audio/player?audio_id=2018743281\">urged the prime minister to stay the course and choose the conservative path</a>, saying if the country came out of lockdown too soon, months of good work would be lost.</p> \n<p>Scientist Dr Michelle Dickinson, who participated in a press conference for children with the prime minister, praised the government\u2019s decision.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhile other countries show no sign of any control of Covid-19 I\u2019m so proud of NZ &amp; what we\u2019ve done as a nation,\u201d Dickinson said on Twitter.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe had some of the toughest lockdown rules in the world, but today we can be optimistic about coming out of it on Monday &amp; feeling safe that this is the right decision\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The best review ever received by Elliott Gould \u2013 renowned actor and star of M*A*S*H and The Long Goodbye; not to mention, Ross and Monica\u2019s dad on Friends \u2013 was from Groucho Marx. The two of them had become close in the comedian\u2019s latter years \u2013 so close, Gould says, \u201che used to let me shave him\u201d. One day Marx asked Gould to change a lightbulb in his bedroom. Gould took off his shoes, stood on the bed and replaced the broken bulb. Marx told him: \u201cThat was the best acting I\u2019ve ever seen you do.\u201d</p> <p>Gould, now 81, has been telling the story for decades \u2013 but it is clear even in our pixelated video call that it still delights him. \u201cIsn\u2019t that great?\u201d he says, his distinctive nasal, New York baritone now deepened with age. As we speak he is sitting at a computer at a friend\u2019s house in Los Angeles, relaxed in a blue hoodie, with a seemingly bottomless mug of coffee before him. In isolation on either side of the Atlantic, neither of us has anywhere to be.

Gould admits his thinking is \u201cnot always linear\u201d. Some memories take time to retrieve: \u201cI flush it out as we\u2019re talking.\u201d But once they emerge, they are precise, both in detail and dialogue, such as his \u201clittle date\u201d with Elvis.</p> <p>Back in the 70s, Gould asked to meet Presley in his Las Vegas dressing room. They were at close quarters, Gould recalls, made all the more so by the conspicuous, gilded .45 automatic in Elvis\u2019s belt and the watchful presence of his manager, Tom \u201cThe Colonel\u201d Parker, as well as the singer\u2019s father, Vernon. It was clear to Gould that they would not let their \u201ccash cow\u201d out of their sight and he said so, urging Presley to \u201cleave \u2018Elvis\u2019 here and come out, be a free spirit\u201d. \u201cElvis says to me, with his gold gun in his belt: \u2018You\u2019re crazy, man.\u2019 I said: \u2018Elvis, I ain\u2019t crazy. I\u2019m scared, just like you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Gould was born Elliott Goldstein in Brooklyn in 1938, the only child of Bernard and Lucille \u2013 non-orthodox, working-class Jews. Their marriage was troubled (they eventually divorced after 27 years), but they were ambitious for their son, putting him through stage school.</p> <p>He was a shy, fearful child, who loved to get lost in radio dramas, Sherlock Holmes stories and Pinocchio, but struggled to express himself. His parents worried that he was slow to develop. One of his earliest memories is being told, when he was two: \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to feel, and you don\u2019t know how to think, and we\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c7d08b69452ec5f06df267d48dd748e60f23df0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c7d08b69452ec5f06df267d48dd748e60f23df0/0_0_1743_1300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Close to a perfect picture\u2019 ...

When I wept, he did not treat me like a baby and he got through to me.\u201d Later, the teacher gave him a copy of Webster\u2019s dictionary, to which he still routinely refers.</p> <p>In 1957, aged 19, Gould made his Broadway debut in the musical Rumple, at the Alvin theatre. \u201cIt smelled great,\u201d Gould remembers, inhaling the memory. \u201cI could go to the theatre and feel I have some place where I belong.\u201d A few small parts followed. Then, in 1961, he was cast as the leading man in the musical I Can Get It For You Wholesale, \u201cwhich was so unlikely!\u201d he says, with feeling. He sat in on the final audition of the \u201cbrilliant\u201d Barbra Streisand. Gould says he saw elements of himself in her, that same inhibition from childhood: \u201cShe presents herself the way I feel about myself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49ce60e60097d1ecaae2e3c19a12254253e42719\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49ce60e60097d1ecaae2e3c19a12254253e42719/0_58_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Part of the stellar gang in Ocean\u2019s Eleven.

Gould goes quiet and I wonder if our video connection has cut out. Then he says: \u201cShe\u2019s so beautiful, are you kidding?\u201d After her audition, Streisand gave him her phone number aloud; Gould memorised it, and called her. Streisand invited him to see her sing but he declined. \u201cI said: \u2018You\u2019re so good, I think you\u2019re going to be in the show \u2013 we\u2019ll see if we get to know one another then.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Streisand was cast as Gould\u2019s character\u2019s secretary, Miss Marmelstein; the part was enlarged to do her justice. Shortly after the play closed in early 1963, after a stellar run of 300 performances, the pair married. A year later Streisand was the toast of the business in Funny Girl, with an album at No 1. Gould has likened their marriage to both a souffle and a \u201cbath of lava\u201d. Streisand has been working on a book for some time, says Gould, and will often call him to draw on his recollections. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t spin. It\u2019s so precious to me, that it has to be absolutely right.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9706d80de5d9b361fa13ee816fb41409c5304f4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9706d80de5d9b361fa13ee816fb41409c5304f4b/0_80_2528_1517/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gould with Barbra Streisand and Jack Kruschen in the 1962 Broadway play I Can Get it For You Wholesale.

They divorced in 1971, five years after the birth of their son Jason and following a two-year separation. Streisand later called Gould to ask why they had grown apart. He told her: \u201cWe didn\u2019t grow together, and you made yourself more important than us, and all I care about is us. We made it very fast, and no one has what we have.\u201d But, today Gould says: \u201cI couldn\u2019t play the part. I had to be able to find myself, to be able to be myself. I couldn\u2019t let myself live in a mould.\u201d</p> <p>In 1969, Gould starred in Paul Mazursky\u2019s wife-swap comedy Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice. His performance secured him his only Oscar nomination, for best supporting actor. A string of hits followed: Robert Altman\u2019s M*A*S*H, in which Gould cast himself as Trapper John McIntyre, and the student protest film Getting Straight. It was around this time that he got his second-best review \u2013 from Muhammad Ali, who told him: \u201cYou do what you do as well as I do what I do.\u201d</p> <p>In 1970, he appeared on the cover of Time magazine, hailed as \u201cthe star for an uptight age\u201d for his (as he explains it now) \u201cunexpected success\u201d at a time of political upheaval. Later I ask him if the current US administration causes him some distress. \u201c<em>Some</em> distress? Oh my goodness,\u201d he replies, pulling his hands down over his eyes theatrically. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that and it\u2019s not just him.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d715129e9c45e1afbd5c97a519d147f76000e9c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d715129e9c45e1afbd5c97a519d147f76000e9c7/0_97_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gould, Natalie Wood, Robert Culp and Dyan Cannon in Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice.

He says he intends to study politics more, though he seems to avoid talking about it where possible. Shooting the 2013 television drama Ray Donovan with Jon Voight, a Trump supporter, Gould told him: \u201cNo politics, Jon.\u201d (When they work together \u201cit can be like Laurel and Hardy on acid,\u201d he adds.) He recalls a similarly loaded phone conversation with Jack Nicholson, who said to him: \u201cI love being American, Ell.\u201d Gould agreed, making reference to Canada and Mexico. Nicholson shouted back: \u201cNo, no, no! Just America!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought: \u2018Gee, that\u2019s rather Trumpish, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 Diversity is essential to me. It\u2019s essential to all of us.\u201d</p> <p>In 1971, Gould was still cresting the wave and had just returned from Sweden, where he shot The Touch: the first English-language film for legendary director Ingmar Bergman. The director has largely dismissed the picture, but Gould was honoured to be chosen as his first non-Scandinavian leading man and sees working with the demanding director as a transformative moment. He recalls: \u201cBergman said to me, outside a 2,000-year-old church near Stockholm: \u2018You\u2019ve gone beyond your limits and you\u2019ll have to live more to understand what you\u2019ve done.\u2019 \u201cAt that moment, I didn\u2019t know limits.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"51bc1761100c2d3587f4642efc2fef9f4a28edbb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51bc1761100c2d3587f4642efc2fef9f4a28edbb/0_0_1850_2732/677.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018As much as I love to win, I hate losing more\u2019 ...

The 1974 drama California Split, said by some to be the best film about gambling ever made, was semi-autobiographical. Decades later, spending time in casinos for Ocean\u2019s Eleven, Gould says he realised those days were behind him: \u201cAs much as I love to win, I hate losing more, and there\u2019s nothing I need that I can win.\u201d</p> <p>He has always denied ever having had a drug problem: on national television, in 1988; on the phone to Streisand (his response, in summary: \u201cBullshit\u201d); and to me. \u201cI had a reality problem,\u201d is his oft-repeated quip. \u201cOf course I smoked marijuana. I don\u2019t do that now, because I\u2019m centred and balanced and I don\u2019t want to alter that.\u201d As for \u201cmind-expanding drugs\u201d \u2013 mescaline, psilocybin, acid \u2013 Gould says: \u201cI had some experience with that and did some work behind it.\u201d He remembers telling Bergman (then in his 50s) about it. \u201cHe said it was interesting to him, but that he felt he did not want to do it at that time.\u201d Was that experimentation part of his pushing back against directors? \u201cNo. No. No! But still, I saw too much \u2013 I knew too much.\u201d</p> <p>After making The Touch, Gould says he \u201cshould have stayed out of work for a while\u201d. Instead, in 1971, he took on A Glimpse of Tiger as co-producer and star. The film was never made (though it was later retooled as What\u2019s Up, Doc?, starring Streisand), but its story is infamous. Just five days in, production was shut down, following reports of Gould\u2019s erratic behaviour and power struggles. His co-star Kim Darby was so frightened of him that security was hired. Gould says now that he tried to reassure Darby that he was \u201creally very sweet\u201d and that she could ask for \u201ctime out\u201d at any time \u2013 \u201cbut it couldn\u2019t work that way\u201d. Of his attempt to undermine the director, Anthony Harvey, he says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t communicate and I behaved very badly.\u201d</p> <p>Gould says he was \u201cnot sufficiently developed\u201d to harness his newfound vision and naive about the demands of a production. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t compromise. I couldn\u2019t. And I had to find out for myself, taking a chance, not knowing if I would ever get back. It\u2019s pretty fabulous, to take the chance \u2026 and not be enslaved to one\u2019s success,\u201d he says. But the financial toll on Gould was significant and the fallout so disastrous that he was considered unfit to work for two years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"77cc05fa7a44107d6fd643d4fb6c6aedae98adc8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77cc05fa7a44107d6fd643d4fb6c6aedae98adc8/0_96_1819_1091/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gould as Philip Marlowe in Altman\u2019s The Long Goodbye.

The studio insisted that he take a psychiatric test, as well as the standard physical. Gould says Altman\u2019s faith extended to allowing him to improvise a scene where Marlowe paints his face with inky fingerprints at a police station. \u201cIt exhibited the confidence and trust that Altman had in me, because it would have taken 25 minutes to clean me up.\u201d</p> <p> The same year he married the actor Jenny Bogart. They went on to have two children \u2013 and two divorces. \u201cJenny married me three times,\u201d says Gould.

He almost didn\u2019t take the part \u2013 \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much in it for me\u201d \u2013 but wound up doing 22 episodes in the show\u2019s 236-episode run.

Looking back, Gould says it would be \u201cdisloyal\u201d to other crew members to regret any film he has worked on. \u201cSometimes things work, sometimes things don\u2019t work, and we learn from it.\u201d Even the 1978 Matilda, playing opposite a man in a cheap and unsettling kangaroo suit? He is tickled by the memory. \u201cOh, it wasn\u2019t very good.\u201d</p> <p> We have been talking for three hours; even Gould is surprised that there is still coffee left in his mug. These days, he takes pleasure from nature, his children, his grandchildren and reflecting on life. He has been asked to direct but seems unhurried. Gould points to \u201ccareer\u201d, in his prized Webster\u2019s dictionary, as having derived from a Spanish word meaning \u201cobstacle course\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI see it as a circle,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes, when people ask me: \u2018How\u2019s it going?\u2019 I enjoy saying: \u2018It\u2019s going round.\u2019 It always goes around.\u201d He sounds like his favourite critic.</p>",
  "<p>Ed Newman walked to the podium with the calm confidence of a soldier and welcomed us with humility. His audience was 20 virology researchers preparing to lead groups in universities around the UK in 2016.</p> <p>Newman, then a Porton Down-based virologist for Public Health England, had seen more action than all of us combined. He shared photos of his travels in African villages ravaged by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/oct/09/ebola-guinea-family-west-africa-crisis\">some of the most dangerous viruses</a> that face humanity. Pop-up labs set up in tents, with \u201cclean\u201d areas on one side for DNA sequencing equipment to confirm virus infection, and patient areas to the other side, hosting beds with seriously ill people. Fascinating, how a tiny piece of genetic information wrapped in a protein coat can cause such devastation.</p> <p>Let\u2019s face it, viruses that cause \u201cthe sniffles\u201d aren\u2019t what get most of us into virology. Some colleagues quote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/28/zombie-movies-ranked\">zombie apocalypse</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/28/zombie-movies-ranked\"> movies</a> as inspiration for entering the field, and it\u2019s true that there\u2019s a certain macabre thrill in studying these terrible pathogens. But there are really only a few viruses able to kill us within days of infection.</p> <p>Newman spent much of his career <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-28108668\">hunting haemorrhagic fever viruses</a> that fit that description: Ebola and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/apr/05/medicineandhealth.lifeandhealth\">Marburg</a> are both contagious via contact with infected bodily fluids and cause bleeding and organ failure, with mortality rates of up to <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ebola-virus-disease\">90%</a> and <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/marburg-virus-disease\">88%</a> respectively. The incidence of these deadly viruses, however, is extremely rare, and outbreaks are thankfully extinguished rapidly by international teams of experts. Viruses causing the common cold, on the other hand, get a free pass through human populations.</p> <p>What is it that makes a virus deadly, or merely an inconvenience? What determines whether it spreads to become a pandemic, like Sars-Cov-2, or burns out rapidly, in a remote location? What does \u201csuccess\u201d mean, in viral terms? These are questions on many peoples\u2019 minds, as they wonder what else might be out there. Could the next pandemic be 50 times as bad as this one? Is the lethality of viruses a grim lottery, with mere luck separating us from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/07/we-learned-four-valuable-lessons-from-ebola-they-can-help-us-fight-the-coronavirus\">something like Ebola</a> sweeping the Earth?</p> <p>In fact, viruses generally have to follow certain rules if they want to get ahead. Stealth is critical, because these pathogens are unable to thrive and reproduce alone. Instead, they invade host cells and rely on them to, first, decode their genetic information to produce components for new virus particles, next, assemble those components, and finally, release new viruses to infect more cells. If this process causes tissue damage that leads to organ failure, the virus risks perishing along with its host.</p> <p>That\u2019s why \u201cnightmare\u201d viruses \u2013 like those with 90% mortality \u2013 thankfully aren\u2019t always very successful. To survive and thrive, a virus must operate like a spy in enemy territory, skilled at passing its genetic material from cell to cell without alerting the host\u2019s immune response.</p> <p>Viruses responsible for mild to moderate respiratory infections frequently fall into this category. They include respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/parainfluenza/index.html\">human parainfluenza viruses</a>, rhinoviruses, and human coronaviruses. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US estimates that adults have <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/features/rhinoviruses/index.html\">two to three colds a year</a>, and children have even more, but colds pose little threat to people with healthy immune systems. As we now know only too well, Sars-Cov-2 is far more of a menace, because it can cause severe acute respiratory syndrome in some patients, which may lead to between <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30165-X/fulltext\">1% and 7%</a> mortality.</p> <p>A successful spy must be a master of disguise, and so it is with viruses: if they want to evade recognition by immune cells, they must change their protein coat frequently. This is achieved via tiny alterations in their genetic material called mutations. The Goldilocks principle applies here: if the mutations are too subtle, the viral coat will be easily identified by existing antibodies, whereas if they are too drastic they might simply inactivate the virus. The mutations that allow viruses to fly under the radar fall somewhere in between. Influenza viruses, which use rapidly evolving ribonucleic acid (RNA) as their genetic material, are experts at this game.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/09/spanish-flu-pandemic-centenary-first-world-war\">History teaches us</a> that influenza mutations can result in pandemics with millions of deaths, so we\u2019ve learned to keep a watchful eye on them. As flu evolves over the months, virologists respond by producing seasonal vaccines that remain effective \u2013 for a time, at least.</p> <p>Coronaviruses have RNA genomes too, but they are very large. That means that there are many more opportunities for mutations to go wrong \u2013 from the virus\u2019s point of view. As a result, they have developed a sort of \u201cproof-reading\u201d mechanism that edits out mutations \u2013 meaning that they change a lot less rapidly than flu does. This is good news for us, and for vaccine development. But we still need more information to determine just how long a vaccine might be effective for.</p> <p>How does a virus go on to achieve world domination? Getting from A to B is of the essence. Sars-Cov-2 rides droplets propelled by coughs and sneezes to board a new host. This is a more effective route of transmission than that used by non-respiratory viruses like Ebola, and its efficiency is increased if the virus particles are more stable and can survive on surfaces outside the body. This is why keeping a safe distance from each other and isolating patients is so useful in preventing new infections. Sars-Cov-2 also has a lipid-containing coat, so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/12/science-soap-kills-coronavirus-alcohol-based-disinfectants\">thorough handwashing with soap</a>, which breaks down fats, can stop it in its tracks.</p> <p>It should be increasingly clear that to end the pandemic and keep Covid-19 outbreaks to a minimum, we need to seriously upgrade our spyware. We need surveillance teams of epidemiologists that decipher patterns of viral spread and molecular virologists to track virus evolution so we can update our defences. We need immunologists to help to understand how the body fights the virus and aid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2020/apr/16/covid-19-what-would-immunity-look-like-podcast\">vaccine research</a>. We also need trained and well-equipped doctors and nurses to safely look after infected people, and scientists to help design effective treatments.</p> <p>We need to fund these heroes well, and keep their kit up to date, and we need structures and public health strategies in place to promote hygiene, contain outbreaks and prevent transmission. Covid-19 has shown us that we must stay vigilant, and each of us can personally help break the transmission cycle.</p> <p>What if a new pathogen emerges and bears all those terrifying hallmarks of viral success \u2013 it doesn\u2019t kill us quickly, mutates often, and is easily transmitted? We rely on the World Health Organization to report new outbreaks and international teams of experts to act rapidly to contain them. It\u2019s important that both receive proper funding and support from governments. </p> <p>When someone like Newman, or the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-public-health-rapid-support-team-uk-phrst\">UK\u2019s Public Health Rapid Support Team</a>, receives a call to pick up their pop-up lab and join other defenders at the heart of the outbreak, not everyone welcomes them on location, and people are understandably reluctant to keep away from their infected loved ones. These teams will have their work cut out for them. But their work is vital. And when they return they will doubtless have lots of stories to share with the new generation of virologists \u2013 some of them, hopefully, inspired to join the fight by the crisis we\u2019re now battling.</p> <p>\u2022 Dr Zania Stamataki is a senior lecturer and researcher in viral immunology at the University of Birmingham</p>",

New York itself has become the epicentre of the North American outbreak. And Pier 90 is now famous for a grimmer reason: it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/comfort-ship-new-york-coronavirus-failure-symbol\">where a US Navy hospital ship is moored</a>.</p> <p>There isn\u2019t a business worldwide that hasn\u2019t felt the virus\u2019s impact, with calamitous results for millions. And the art world has been far from immune. An industry that has become synonymous with hyper-connectedness and global mobility is now, like the rest of us, at a standstill. The art market is idling. The places where we experience art \u2013 <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/museum-lockdown-impact-survey-1827237\">from </a><a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/museum-lockdown-impact-survey-1827237\">leading museums to the tiniest independent spaces</a> \u2013 are abruptly out of bounds. Many galleries are likely to go out of business; artists will lose livelihoods. A recent piece by the New York magazine art critic, Jerry Saltz, carried an apocalyptic headline: <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/how-the-coronavirus-will-transform-the-art-world.html\">The Last Days of the Art World</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aabb0282c1909095072ca5c13fee5e90d84a82bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aabb0282c1909095072ca5c13fee5e90d84a82bc/0_86_4366_2618/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman wears a face mask while visiting the Armory Show in New York last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The last days before the lockdown \u2026 a woman wears a face mask while visiting the Armory Show in New York last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Lane/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pivotal moment,\u201d suggests <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/apr/16/tate-modern-director-frances-morris-interview\">Frances Morris, director of Tate Modern</a>, when we speak. \u201cWe\u2019re going to talk in terms of before and after. The virus will change a lot of things for art.\u201d</p> <p>But what sort of changes, and what sort of things? Is there only emptiness on the horizon, or are there opportunities, too? And when we finally emerge, what will art \u2013 and, yes, the art world \u2013 look like?</p> <p>One glimmer of hope is that, though we can\u2019t see art in person, we seem hungry to access it by any means possible. Galleries have been experiencing record web traffic: visitors to the British Museum site soared in the early days of the crisis, <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/art-design/2020/03/virtual-galleries-art-museums-tours-online\">while the Courtauld Gallery\u2019s virtual tour reported an astonishing 723% spike in visitors in mid-March</a>. Every private gallery worth its salt has launched \u201conline viewing rooms\u201d. Even the blue-chip <a href=\"https://www.artbasel.com/stories/online-viewing-rooms-announcement\">Art Basel Hong Kong fair went virtual</a> after being forced to cancel the physical event.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d says Alison Cole, editor of industry bible the Art Newspaper. \u201cAfter talking about it for years, a lot of people are finally seizing the opportunity of online.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dee6eae040043b833bbec26d95028da3ac0bc247\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dee6eae040043b833bbec26d95028da3ac0bc247/0_0_500_886/282.jpg\" alt=\"Artist Martin Creed livestreams a jam session from his home.\" width=\"282\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Artist Martin Creed livestreams a jam session from his home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: http://www.martincreed.com/site</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Social media has been part of the art world for a while. But with physical galleries now empty it\u2019s suddenly the sole means for organisations to retain a connection to audiences. The most august institutions are revealing a more unbuttoned, down-to-earth side: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/royalacademy?lang=en\">the Royal Academy Twitter feed</a>, previously full of earnest promos for RA events, has been taken over by an #RAdailydoodle challenge aimed at amateur artists (sample post: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/royalacademy/status/1248259270363222017\">\u201cWho can draw us a thirsty ferret?\u201d</a>). Other galleries are trialling similar projects \u2013 less top-down, more collaborative.</p> <p>Morris at Tate detects a deep shift: \u201cHaving a real conversation with real people is hugely exciting. I think it\u2019s partly because people are missing the social space of being in a museum. It\u2019s something we haven\u2019t always done enough. And once we reopen, we get a chance to recalibrate that.\u201d</p> <p>The same is true behind the scenes, she adds: the fact that the hectic merry-go-round of openings and events has paused means that it\u2019s possible to get hold of people. \u201cEveryone seems more available, perversely. I\u2019ve been having conversations with colleagues from all over the world.\u201d</p> <p>Beneath all this, of course, there is a grim reality: money. With the global economy stalled, <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/market/how-the-art-world-became-the-art-industry-1710228\">the wealth that has fuelled the art world for the past 20 years</a> \u2013 a period of discombobulating growth, museum expansions, soaring auction prices, more art fairs by the month \u2013 is suddenly in doubt.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like we\u2019ve been partying for the last two decades,\u201d says Morris. The <a href=\"https://www.davidzwirner.com/\">commercial gallerist David Zwirner</a>, who now has spaces in New York, Hong Kong, London and Paris, concurs: \u201cIt got out of hand, especially the market: crazy auction prices and the rest. The infiltration of value into the perception of art, art being regarded as an asset \u2013 all that needs to be rethought.\u201d</p> <p>Is he fearful for the future? \u201cOf course. There\u2019s going to be a lot of pain, especially for smaller galleries. And, of course, artists.\u201d</p> <p>Cole is similarly anxious: \u201cAt the top end, the art world is a luxury industry, but many of the people who work in it \u2013 the artists, the handlers, gallery staff \u2013 are in very precarious positions. We published an article the other day saying that a third of<a href=\"https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/one-third-of-french-galleries-could-shut-before-end-of-2020-due-to-coronavirus-impact\"> French galleries could close by the end of 2020</a>. Even if the art market bounces back, it\u2019s going to be a much smaller world.\u201d</p> <p>Yet, while accounting for these very real hardships \u2013 local museums in the UK are especially vulnerable \u2013 both Cole and Morris argue that there are clues here as to how things might operate differently. \u201c\u2018Normal\u2019 was unsustainable,\u201d Cole argues. \u201cThe endless expansion, the mega-collectors, the purchasing of big trophy objects. I think we\u2019re entering a period of less is more. I hope it\u2019ll be less macho.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fc66068f64baba814cc69daec4bb06870e9feab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fc66068f64baba814cc69daec4bb06870e9feab/0_0_3500_2275/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A final look at Fons Americanus, Kara Walker\u2019s Turbine Hall commission as the Tate Gallery went into lockdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"650\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A final look at Fons Americanus, Kara Walker\u2019s Turbine Hall commission as the Tate Gallery went into lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Morris suggests that footfall-driving blockbuster exhibitions, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/mar/21/how-to-move-a-masterpiece-secret-business-shipping-priceless-artworks-art-handling\">star loans shipped carbon-intensively from Berlin to LA to Tokyo</a>, might have had their day. \u201cIt\u2019d be great for museums to focus on their permanent collections, the amazing things we already possess. We\u2019ve taken our eye off the core mission. I\u2019d love a return to slower looking.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone agrees that, whatever comes next, galleries will have a bigger role than ever. The moment they reopen, it\u2019s hard not to see them being thronged, says Zwirner: \u201cThe work of art in a physical space is different: it craves you. Looking at art is a communal act.\u201d</p> <p>The big question, of course, is what we\u2019ll be looking at: with an event as all-enveloping as the current pandemic, is it too early to speak of \u201ccorona art\u201d?</p> <p>The contemporary artist <a href=\"https://www.theartnewspaper.com/blog/artists-show-us-what-they-have-been-up-to-during-the-lockdown-while-ryan-gander-does-a-live-studio-tour-today\">Ryan Gander has talked of the \u201ctime famine\u201d</a> afflicting the art world; artists \u2013 like many of us \u2013 now have plenty of time on their hands. And whether they\u2019re sequestered in their studios or trying to balance childcare and laundry, many will end up channelling their experiences of this strangest of moments into the work they make. Judging by <a href=\"https://www.lissongallery.com/news/studio-join-ryan-gander-s-live-walkthrough\">Gander\u2019s Zoom studio tours</a> and <a href=\"http://www.martincreed.com/site/live\">Martin Creed\u2019s livestream jam sessions</a>, some already are.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e410c885888997a144c4fba2da7fcfba72215cb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e410c885888997a144c4fba2da7fcfba72215cb1/0_0_601_474/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sketchy \u2026 the Royal Academy\u2019s doodle a ferret challenge.\" width=\"500\" height=\"394\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sketchy \u2026 the Royal Academy\u2019s doodle a ferret challenge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: RA Twitter - @royalacademy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Morris isn\u2019t sure what will result, but feels confident that it will be worth attending to: \u201cIf you look at the great traumatising events of the past \u2013 world wars, global emergencies of different kinds \u2013 artists have always responded,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter the first world war it was dada and surrealism; after the second, existentialism and gestural abstraction. Whatever the work looks like, it\u2019ll be interesting.\u201d</p> <p>Keen to get an artist\u2019s perspective, I track down the Argentinian-born, New York-based Mika Rottenberg, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/29/arts/design/mika-rottenberg-review-new-museum.html\">best known for her unsettling installations and videos</a>, some of which take aim \u2013 appropriately enough \u2013 at the excesses of late capitalism. When we Skype, she\u2019s in upstate New York, trying to balance home-schooling her daughter and connecting with colleagues and friends, many of whose projects have been cancelled or postponed.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Rottenberg seems \u2013 if not exactly upbeat \u2013 at least philosophical. As an active member of the <a href=\"https://www.culturedeclares.org/\">Culture Declares climate movement</a>, she sees a strong connection between the climate emergency and the coronavirus one, and she is thinking hard about how art fits in \u2013 both as a response and something that can illuminate a path forward. More practically, she is using tools such as video conferencing to collaborate with other artists and scope out projects. She can\u2019t be physically present in a gallery, but perhaps she doesn\u2019t need to be.</p> <p>\u201cThe fear is that we become more conservative, build a wall around ourselves,\u201d Rottenberg says. \u201cI really don\u2019t want that to happen. And even if we can\u2019t travel, I don\u2019t want us to abandon that sense of global connectedness, the exchange of ideas. Right now we need hospital beds and ventilators and masks, but art has a role to play too. It has to.\u201d</p> <p>Has she actually been able to get any work done? She laughs. \u201cI\u2019m used to multi-tasking. When I\u2019m not editing video, my favourite spot in the studio is the kitchen table.\u201d</p> <p>Coronavirus has shown how many of us, when trapped at home, have reached instinctively for art. Maybe it\u2019s taking <a href=\"http://www.museivaticani.va/content/museivaticani/en/collezioni/musei/cappella-sistina/tour-virtuale.html\">a virtual spin around the Sistine Chapel</a>, or dusting off craft materials. Maybe it\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/royalacademy/status/1248261163877613569\">sketching ferrets</a>. </p> <p>\u201cPeople are really having to make do with what they have,\u201d says Cole. \u201cThey\u2019re sharing images, video, memes, using art in all sorts of creative ways.\u201d She ponders the question. \u201cArt is really useful at the moment. Whatever comes next, we have to cling to that.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Leading medical journal The Lancet recently published <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lanpsy/PIIS2215-0366(20)30168-1.pdf\">a position paper</a> authored by 24 mental health experts. It begins: \u201cIt is already evident that the direct and indirect psychological and social effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic are pervasive and could affect mental health now and in the future.\u201d</p> <p>It is a hypothesis substantiated by Professional Footballers Australia who last week <a href=\"http://pfa.net.au/news/news-covid-19-having-alarming-impact-on-the-mental-health-of-australian-professional-footballers/\">published findings</a> of a survey of over 150 of its members. Since the suspension of professional football in Australia, 58% of players have reported symptoms of anxiety while 45% demonstrated symptoms of depression. Ordinarily, moderate-to-severe anxiety reporting peaks at about 8%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/18/a-priceless-time-at-home-australias-alex-carey-takes-positives-from-lockdown-life\">\u2018A priceless time at home\u2019: Australia's Alex Carey takes positives from lockdown life | Scott Heinrich</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe hardest thing is the uncertainty,\u201d Central Coast Mariners striker Matt Simon tells Guardian Australia. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from being around teammates every single day and training every day to all of a sudden just being stood down without pay and no word on what\u2019s going to be happening and no word on when the next payment is coming for everyone\u2019s livelihoods.\u201d</p> <p>Such uncertainty must now be prevalent in most workforces, making the insight into professional sportspeople all the more instructive. This is a cohort synonymous with high achievement, resilience and an abundance of positive reinforcement.</p> <p>\u201cI think there are a lot of misconceptions about professional athletes,\u201d Simon argues. \u201cI saw a story a couple of weeks ago saying that we shouldn\u2019t feel sorry for A-League players because they\u2019ve been stood down without pay. I thought that was an absolute joke, because what about the player that\u2019s sacrificed so much, is not on a lot of money, but he just does it because he loves the game and he\u2019s got three kids at home? Now all of a sudden he has no money coming in. They are stressful times for a player \u2013 how is he going to feed his kids?\u201d</p> <p>Footballers are the victims of greater uncertainty than professionals from other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/15/tables-turn-with-nrls-viability-no-longer-threatened-by-broadcaster-backlash\">high-profile local sports</a>. The shutdown arrived before the conclusion of drawn-out negotiations to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/01/a-league-clubs-to-take-control-of-competition-in-new-deal-with-ffa\">decouple the A-League and W-League</a> from Football Federation Australia. There has been some ad-hoc devolution but no clear resolution, leaving the game looking in many directions for answers.</p> <p>The situation is made even more perilous by the reluctance of Fox Sports to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/16/australian-footballs-fox-sports-conundrum-looming-disaster-or-reset-opportunity\">continue its financial investment</a> in Australian football. The broadcaster has indicated it is looking to withdraw from football as soon as possible, and the absence of matches to broadcast has provided it grounds to withhold the latest quarterly $12m payment to A-League clubs. <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/fox-sports-ffa-on-path-to-divorce-after-a-league-instalment-not-paid-20200416-p54kj0.html\">A legal stoush</a> looms. Little has been said on the record.</p> <p>What does that mean on the ground? \u201cThe silence from the governing bodies, not coming out and giving us any answers, I don\u2019t think is great,\u201d says Simon. \u201cObviously, some people know what\u2019s going on and discussions are behind closed doors. I think those people need to come out and say what\u2019s happening. If something doesn\u2019t happen sooner or later, like many people around the country, we\u2019re going to have to start looking at different avenues for employment.\u201d</p> <p>There may be some comparisons to draw with the demise of the old National Soccer League, but the current crisis is arguably more acute, as Beau Busch, PFA\u2019s head of player development, outlines. \u201cWhen the NSL ended there were opportunities to play in the NPL, Asia, or Europe. The current level of uncertainty is unprecedented,\u201d he says.</p> <p>This heightened anxiety around financial insecurity is compounded by isolation from teammates and interruptions to training routines, key pillars of an athlete\u2019s mental health. \u201cPlayers are used to being surrounded by people on a daily basis and there isn\u2019t really any substitute for that,\u201d Busch says.</p> <p>Or as Simon puts it: \u201cI think all players would be saying they miss the banter in the change room, when you play football for a long period of time your teammates pretty much become your family and you do take it for granted when it gets taken away from you.\u201d</p> <p>The importance of camaraderie to mental health is not unique to the professional game. All across the country weekend warriors are now missing their fix of mateship.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/16/australian-footballs-fox-sports-conundrum-looming-disaster-or-reset-opportunity\">Australian football's Fox Sports conundrum \u2013 looming disaster or reset opportunity? | Richard Parkin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cLocal sporting clubs play such an important community cohesion role around Australia and a tough side of the isolation requirements is the loss of the regular social and physical contact with fellow sporting club members,\u201d explains Dr Grant Blashki, Beyond Blue\u2019s lead clinical advisor.</p> <p>\u201cThere is good evidence that sporting activities are excellent for maintaining wellbeing because they usually combine physical exercise, social connectedness and routine, which are all very beneficial.

After several hours of vetting, we grew confident of the broker\u2019s professional pedigree and the potential to secure a large shipment of three-ply face masks and N95 respirators. The latter were KN95 respirators, N95s that were made in China. We received samples to confirm that they could be successfully fit-tested. Despite having cleared this hurdle, we remained concerned that the samples might not be representative of the bulk of the products that we would be buying. Having acquired the requisite funds \u2013 more than five times the amount we would normally pay for a similar shipment, but still less than what was being requested by other brokers \u2013 we set the plan in motion. Three members of the supply-chain team and a fit tester were flown to a small airport near an industrial warehouse in the mid-Atlantic region. <strong>I arrived by car to make the final call on whether to execute the deal. Two semi-trailer trucks, cleverly marked as food-service vehicles, met us at the warehouse. When fully loaded, the trucks would take two distinct routes back to Massachusetts to minimize the chances that their contents would be detained or redirected.</strong></p> \n   <p>Hours before our planned departure, we were told to expect only a quarter of our original order. We went anyway, since we desperately needed any supplies we could get. Upon arrival, we were jubilant to see pallets of KN95 respirators and face masks being unloaded. We opened several boxes, examined their contents, and hoped that this random sample would be representative of the entire shipment. Before we could send the funds by wire transfer, two Federal Bureau of Investigation agents arrived, showed their badges, and started questioning me. No, this shipment was not headed for resale or the black market. The agents checked my credentials, and I tried to convince them that the shipment of PPE was bound for hospitals. After receiving my assurances and hearing about our health system\u2019s urgent needs, the agents let the boxes of equipment be released and loaded into the trucks. <strong>But I was soon shocked to learn that the Department of Homeland Security was still considering redirecting our PPE.</strong> Only some quick calls leading to intervention by our congressional representative prevented its seizure. I remained nervous and worried on the long drive back, feelings that did not abate until midnight, when I received the call that the PPE shipment was secured at our warehouse.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9caef48f080ee110447e18\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-19T20:11:37.245Z\">9.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A number of US governors from both sides of the aisle, including Virginia Democrat Ralph Northam and Maryland Republican Larry Hogan, have accused Donald Trump of making \u201cdelusional\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d statements amid mounting pressure to roll back stay-at-home measures. </p> \n  <p>As the Guardian\u2019s Richard Luscombe and Edward Helmore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-governors-trump-making-delusional-comments\">report</a>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Many state leaders have said they cannot embark on Trump\u2019s recommended <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/\">three-phrase programme</a> to ease stay-at-home restrictions without a robust and widespread system of testing in place.</p> \n   <p>Researchers at Harvard University have suggested the US should conduct more than three times the number of coronavirus tests it is currently administering over the course of the next month, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-testing-states.html\">New York Times reported</a>.</p> \n   <p>Democratic Governor Ralph Northam of Virginia told CNN on Sunday that claims by Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence that states have plenty of tests were \u201cjust delusional\u201d.</p> \n   <p>\u201cWe have been fighting for testing,\u201d he said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have enough swabs, believe it or not.

  "<p>In early January, Hu Aizhen, 65, heard that a new coronavirus had emerged in her home city, Wuhan. She was not worried \u2013 officials said it was not contagious \u2013 so she went about her days as usual and prepared for the lunar new year at the end of the month.</p> <p>Just before the city was put under lockdown, Hu developed pneumonia symptoms. After days of waiting and searching for a hospital, she was tested for the virus. Her result was negative, but tests at the time were known to be inaccurate and she showed obvious signs of the virus. Nevertheless, she was refused treatment by six hospitals.</p> <p>Hu, who had always been healthy, stayed at home for 10 days, unable to drink or eat, while her health deteriorated. When she took a further turn for the worse, her son tried to get her to a hospital in another district but police stopped them. Under lockdown orders they could not cross into another district. Her son, desperate, shouted at the traffic officers: \u201cAre you not people?\u201d</p> <p>When Hu was finally admitted to a hospital on 8 February, she was struggling to breathe. The doctor ordered another test, but it was too late. She regained consciousness briefly, asking her son to pour her some water. Then she died.</p> <p>Hu\u2019s son is now suing the Wuhan municipal government for allegedly concealing the seriousness of the virus, among other complaints, according to court documents prepared by Funeng, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/29/staff-of-changsha-funeng-ngo-hong-kong-arrested-in-southern-china\">public welfare NGO</a> based in Changsha. Hu\u2019s son is among a small but significant group of residents seeking answers, compensation or simply an apology from officials who took weeks to notify the public of the threat from a virus that went on to claim the lives of at least 4,000 people in China, according to government figures, most of them in Wuhan.</p> <p>Other cases include a civil servant suing the Hubei provincial government, a mother petitioning for officials to be punished after watching her 24-year-old daughter die of the virus, and a son who rushed his quickly fading mother to a hospital in the suburbs of Wuhan where he was able to get her admitted to intensive care. When he went to pick up supplies for her, he received a phone call from the hospital. His mother had died.</p> <p>\u201cNone of this would have happened if they had told us. So many people would not have had to die,\u201d said a relative involved in one of the lawsuits. Another said: \u201cI want an answer. I want those responsible to be punished under the law.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4bc781c0f8ce63be2f416b7dc3d193ae84a4ef69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bc781c0f8ce63be2f416b7dc3d193ae84a4ef69/0_195_1536_922/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zhang Hai, who died from coronavirus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zhang Hai\u2019s father, Zhang Lifa, who died on 1 February from coronavirus in Wuhan, aged 76.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Family handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the outbreak spread in China, with thousands of confirmed cases a day at its peak, public anger reached levels not seen in decades, posing a serious threat to the ruling Chinese communist party. When the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/chinese-inquiry-exonerates-coronavirus-whistleblower-doctor-li-wenliang\">whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang</a> died from the virus in February, censors could not keep up with the flood of outrage online. It was a moment some compared to the outpouring over the death of Hu Yaobang that precipitated the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.</p> <p>A little more than two months on, the resentment is much less visible. Accounts like Hu Aizhen\u2019s have been replaced by positive stories of the country coming together to defeat the virus, sending needed supplies to the rest of the world and fighting malicious attacks from the US and other countries blaming Beijing for the outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are easily led by propaganda,\u201d said Shi, a human rights activist based in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital. \u201cAs the epidemic situation has improved and the propaganda machine works, there has been a reversal. Now people are saying the strong leadership of the party is a good thing.\u201d</p> <p>As Wuhan and the rest of the country slowly return to normal, authorities are carefully monitoring those who might harbour resentment. Zhang Hai, 50, whose father died from the virus in February, was part of a WeChat group of more than 100 people who lost relatives to the virus.</p> <p>In late March they were told they could retrieve their loved ones\u2019 remains from funeral homes. No more than five could go together at one time, and they had to be accompanied by a local government representative. Zhang refused to go. Later, the group\u2019s host was called in by the police and the WeChat group was deleted.</p> <p>\u201cNow everyone is trying to be very careful,\u201d said Zhang, who is calling for the government to issue an apology. \u201cI know a lot of families who are incredibly angry.\u201d</p> <p>Tan Jun, a civil servant in Yichang in Hubei province, filed a complaint this month accusing the Hubei provincial government of concealing the outbreak, according to copies of the lawsuit posted online. Tan confirmed the lawsuit but declined to be interviewed. Other residents in Wuhan who spoke to the Guardian said they had been intimidated by local police and forced to promise not to speak out.</p> <p>\u201cPeople must take responsibility. As a resident of Hubei, I believe it is necessary to stand up and call on the Hubei government to take responsibility,\u201d Tan said, according to an article posted on several WeChat accounts that has <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/_lUMee0j2VLaQiHQHSGPYQ\">now been deleted</a>.</p> <p>While authorities in Beijing have punished local officials by replacing them \u2013 what observers say is an age-old tactic for deflecting blame from the central government \u2013 residents say this is not enough.</p> <p>\u201cThat is not accountability. That is switching hats,\u201d said another resident who is suing her hospital. She says she contracted the virus in January but was not officially diagnosed until much later. In hospital she watched people around her die, including a woman in the next bed. Recently she learned that a classmate of hers who got sick around the same time had passed away.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was laying in bed thinking I might soon die, I thought: how did this happen?\u201d she said. \u201cRegular people have limited access to real information. We rely on the government. We believe what the government says.\u201d</p> <p>Dissent has spread in other ways. Dozens of shop owners at a shopping mall in Wuhan demonstrated this month, demanding rent reductions after months of not being able to open their stores. In Yingcheng, a city west of Wuhan, residents put under lockdown protested against the high prices for food imposed by community management. One of the protesters, Zeng Chunzhi, has reportedly <a href=\"https://wqw2010.blogspot.com/2020/04/blog-post_38.html?spref=tw\">been detained</a>.</p> <p>\u201cPeople have been awakened. That\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Xie Yanyi, a rights lawyer based in Beijing. He has filed a request for information from the government, including the origins of the virus and reasons for the delay in informing the public of the outbreak. \u201cThe issue is they have not yet found their role or what actions to take. That still needs time,\u201d he said, acknowledging that such people are the minority. \u201cIt may not be many people, but history shows that it is the few who change society and who change history.\u201d</p> <p>In Wuhan, most residents are relieved that the worst of the epidemic appears to be over as they watch other countries struggle to contain it. Employees wait in lines outside of office buildings to have their throats swabbed, to make sure they do not have the virus before going back to work.</p> <p>On the riverbank in Hankou district, a couple kiss in front of what has become a nightly light show of skyscrapers lit up with congratulatory messages. Many residents say they appreciate what their country has done for them.</p> <p>The chance that cases such as Hu\u2019s will be accepted and go to court are not high, according to Yang Zhanqing, a co-founder of Funeng. More likely, those involved will be intimidated or harassed. But in some cases, especially determined plaintiffs can get compensation, which is one form of apology.</p> <p>\u201cThese cases apply pressure on the government and help more people understand their rights and the government\u2019s responsibility,\u201d Yang said. \u201cThis is also a way of documenting history, letting more people know the truth, and not just the government\u2019s version of what happened in Wuhan.\u201d</p>"
