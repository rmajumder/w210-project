  "<p>A Trump loyalist nominated as director of national intelligence (DNI) looked set to sail through Senate confirmation hearings on Tuesday, only nine months after being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/02/john-ratcliffe-trumps-intelligence-chief-pick-withdraws-amid-qualification-doubts\">forced to withdraw</a> for having exaggerated his security experience.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/02/john-ratcliffe-trumps-intelligence-chief-pick-withdraws-amid-qualification-doubts\">John Ratcliffe: Trump's intelligence chief pick withdraws amid qualification doubts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>John Ratcliffe, a Republican congressman who fiercely defended the president in last year\u2019s impeachment hearings, told the Senate intelligence committee that he would speak truth to power if confirmed as DNI.</p> <p>Ratcliffe was reminded by Democratic senators that his two predecessors had been forced from their posts because the findings of the intelligence community irritated Donald Trump, and that the spy agencies were <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/02/21/richard-grenell-dni-the-death-of-truth-to-power/\">currently under pressure</a> to provide evidence for Trump\u2019s claim that the coronavirus outbreak started in a Chinese laboratory.</p> <p>\u201cRegardless of what anyone wants our intelligence to reflect, the intelligence I will provide, if confirmed, will not be impacted or altered as a result of outside influence,\u201d Ratcliffe said in his opening remarks at his <a href=\"https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/hearings/open-hearing-nomination-john-l-ratcliffe-be-director-national-intelligence\">confirmation hearing</a>, held under social distancing rules, with most of the senators and staff wearing masks. \u201cAbove all, my fidelity and loyalty will always be to the constitution and rule of law, and my actions as DNI will reflect that commitment.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2442964fe844b7d62c721dff4e26a8ef843d8fcc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2442964fe844b7d62c721dff4e26a8ef843d8fcc/0_242_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Senators wear masks and practice social distancing rules at the nomination hearing of John Ratcliffe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Senators wear masks and practice social distancing rules at the nomination hearing of John Ratcliffe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However Ratcliffe, a fiercely partisan congressman, dodged questions on which Trump has broken with his own intelligence briefers, such as whether there has been any progress towards North Korean disarmament (there has not) and whether Iran was in compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal when Trump pulled the US out of the agreement (it was).</p> <p>Ratcliffe said that if confirmed, he would focus on the impact of coronavirus, questions about its origins in China and US competition with Beijing.</p> <p>\u201cI view China as the greatest threat actor right now,\u201d he said. \u201cLook with respect to Covid-19 and the role China plays; the race to 5G; cybersecurity issues: all roads lead to China,\u201d he told the panel.</p> <p>Ratcliffe <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ratcliffe-withdraws-from-consideration-for-intelligence-chief-trump-says/2019/08/02/9f3c42cc-b551-11e9-951e-de024209545d_story.html\">withdrew his first nomination</a> five days after Trump first named him as a candidate \u2013 to widespread surprise \u2013 last July, after it was found he had grossly overstated his national security experience.</p> <p>He had falsely claimed on his website to have \u201carrested over 300 illegal immigrants in a single day\u201d and had \u201cput terrorists in prison\u201d although he had not tried a terrorism case in his time as a US attorney.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t see what has changed since last summer \u2026 when the president decided not to proceed with your nomination over concerns about your inexperience, partisanship and past statements that seemed to embellish your record,\u201d the ranking Democrat on committee, Senator Mark Warner, said on Tuesday.</p> <p>However the committee chair, Senator Richard Burr, and the other Republicans on the panel, indicated they would back Ratcliffe\u2019s nomination and quickly put it to a vote in the full Senate, despite a legal requirement that the DNI \u201cshall have extensive national security expertise\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe Democrats in the committee and the Senate seem strongly opposed, but Ratcliffe seems likely to secure confirmation, probably on a party-line vote,\u201d said Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor.</p> <p>Tobias suggested that Ratcliffe\u2019s promises to be objective may have assuaged doubters on the committee, or that Burr\u2019s standing and independence may have been weakened after he was found to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/20/republican-senators-sold-stocks-before-markets-plunged-on-coronavirus-fears-reports\">sold hundreds of thousands of dollars</a> in stocks in mid-February, a few days after publishing a commentary for Fox News claiming that the US was \u201cbetter prepared than ever before\u201d to confront the virus.</p> <p>Katrina Mulligan, a former official who worked for more than 10 years in the office of the director of national intelligence (ODNI), suggested another factor that has changed since last summer could be that the Senate is eager to replace the current acting DNI, Richard Grenell, another partisan with even less experience than Ratcliffe and who is not answerable to Congress because he is not confirmed in the role.</p> <p>Mulligan added that US intelligence officials may be resigned to Ratcliffe getting the top job for similar reasons.</p> <p>\u201cThe morale at ODNI is so low right now and people are so fearful, that I think that there is a real sense that it could be worse,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s this sense that at least he can form coherent sentences, and at least he has a modicum of experience which the current acting DNI really did not.\u201d</p>",

In the past month, at least two <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/twin-sisters-one-a-nurse-in-southampton-two-of-the-latest-to-die-from-coronavirus\">pairs</a> of <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8201467/Twin-sisters-66-die-coronavirus-four-days-other.html\">twins</a> have died in Britain and two pairs of brothers, all within hours or days of each other. But do the deaths point to genetic factors that make some more likely than others to succumb to the disease?</p> \n  <p>Most scientists believe that genes play a role in how people respond to infections. A person\u2019s genetic makeup may influence the receptors that the coronavirus uses to invade human cells. How resilient the person is to the infection, their general health, and how the immune system reacts will also have some genetic component.</p> \n  <p>A team led by Prof Tim Spector, head of twin research and genetic epidemiology at King\u2019s College London, has reported that Covid-19 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/study-of-twins-reveals-genetic-effect-on-covid-19-symptoms\">symptoms appear to be 50% genetic</a>. </p> \n  <p>But Spector said more work is needed to understand which genes are involved and what difference they make to the course of the disease. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if there are genes linked to the receptors or genes linked to how the infection presents,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThese deaths alert people to the fact that this could be genetic, but when people live together they share an environment as well,\u201d Spector said. The upshot is that twins who live together are more likely to have similar lifestyles and behaviours, from diet and exercise habits to how quickly they seek medical care. Twins are not generally less healthy than the wider population. </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/genetics-in-focus-after-coronavirus-deaths-of-siblings-and-twins\">Genetics in focus after coronavirus deaths of siblings and twins</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb159848f083e60eea309f9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-05T12:19:11.765Z\">1.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The mayor of <strong>The Hague</strong> has issued a statement ordering police to break up a demonstration by around 200 people who had gathered to protest against measures ordered by the government to slow the country\u2019s coronavirus outbreak. </p> \n  <p>Police said in a statement that they were \u201cdetaining demonstrators that ignore the mayor\u2019s order\u201d. <span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Local press agency ANP said dozens had been detained.</span></p> \n  <p>The Dutch government has banned public gatherings since mid-March, with people required to stand at least 1.5 metres apart in public spaces.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-05T12:54:17.226Z\">at 1.54pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb1584b8f083e60eea309f2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-05T12:17:05.083Z\">1.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Overcrowded, unhygienic prisons in <strong>Latin America</strong> and the spread of the coronavirus both in regional prisons and in the <strong>US</strong> are a source of \u201cmajor concern\u201d, the UN rights office (OHCHR) has said. </p> \n  <p>In some cases, fear of infection has led to riots, killing dozens of inmates in <strong>Venezuela, Peru and Colombia</strong> in recent weeks. </p> \n  <p>OHCHR called for prompt, independent investigations into these incidents. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIn many countries of Latin America, you have really serious overcrowding,\u201d OHCHR spokesman <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Rupert Colville</strong> told a Geneva briefing, referring to the trend as \u201cdeeply worrying\u201d. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a chronic problem across the continent and in some cases it can be deadly,\u201d he said. </p> \n  <p>In some places, overcapacity levels are as high as 500%, a UN official said, adding that new detentions due to violations of Covid-19 measures in places like Peru have exacerbated this.</p> \n  <p>The UN has already voiced concern over hundreds of thousands of people arrested or detained for quarantine violations. </p> \n  <p>Asked about the situation in US jails, he said that thousands of cases of infections in prisons were a \u201cmajor concern\u201d, naming specifically <strong>New York and Chicago</strong>.

The total number of cases stands at 3,582,469. Experts worry the available data is underplaying the true impact of the pandemic. The Johns Hopkins researchers put the known death toll at 251,510.</li> \n   <li><strong>Hong Kong economy suffers deepest contraction. </strong>Hong Kong\u2019s economy, already damaged by months of protest before the coronavirus outbreak, has recorded its worst decline on record.The region\u2019s GDP shrunk 8.9% year-on-year in the first quarter, the deepest contraction since records began in 1974, and the fourth consecutive quarter to drop. Chief executive Carrie Lam noted it was worse than that experienced during the Asian financial crisis in 1998.</li> \n   <li><strong>Five Eyes network contradicts theory Covid-19 leaked from lab.</strong>There is no current evidence to suggest that coronavirus leaked from a Chinese research laboratory, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/five-eyes-network-contradicts-theory-covid-19-leaked-from-lab\">intelligence sources have told the Guardian</a>, contradicting recent White House claims that there is growing proof this is how the pandemic began.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>WHO says has no proof from US on \u2018speculative\u2019 Wuhan lab claims. </strong>The World Health Organization said Monday that Washington had provided no evidence to support \u201cspeculative\u201d claims by US president Donald Trump and Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, that the new coronavirus originated in a Chinese lab, AFP reports.</li> \n   <li><strong>Fauci says there is no scientific evidence virus came from Chinese laboratory. </strong>Dr. Anthony Fauci, the foremost US expert on infections diseases and a key member of Donald Trump\u2019s coronavirus task force, said in an interview with National Geographic that there is <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/05/anthony-fauci-no-scientific-evidence-the-coronavirus-was-made-in-a-chinese-lab-cvd/\">no scientific basis</a> for the theory that coronavirus was man-made in a Chinese laboratory, or escaped from a laboratory after being brought in from the wild.</li> \n   <li><strong>Chinese state media on Monday denounced Mike Pompeo as \u201cinsane</strong>\u201d. Pompeo has also joined Trump in attacking the World Health Organization, which said Monday it had no evidence that the virus came out of a laboratory.</li> \n   <li><strong>Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison was also asked about the lab theory. </strong>Morrison said there had been no change to the Australian position on the theory, which is that no possibilities could be ruled out, but the most likely origin of the virus is a wildlife wet market. He reiterated calls for a \u201ctransparent\u201d review into the outbreak and the World Health Organization\u2019s response to the outbreak. </li> \n   <li><strong>New Zealand records no new cases for second day in a row,</strong> as the government considers whether to further relax the country\u2019s lockdown restrictions. Monday was the first time since before New Zealand\u2019s national shutdown began on 25 March that there were no new cases of the virus diagnosed. </li> \n   <li><strong>Australia and New Zealand confirm plans for \u201csafe travel zone\u201d. </strong>Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern have officially confirmed plans for a \u201csafe travel zone\u201d between the two countries.

Italy and Spain each said they would provide more than \u20ac100m.</li> \n   <li><strong>Austrian unemployment at all-time high. </strong>The coronavirus pandemic has pushed the number of unemployed Austrians to historically high levels, with a year-on-year rise of almost 60%.</li> \n   <li><strong>Carnival to resume cruises in August. </strong>Carnival Cruise Line has announced plans to resume operations at the beginning of August despite dozens of deaths on cruise ships during the Covid-19 pandemic and investigations into the industry\u2019s possible role in spreading the disease around the globe.</li> \n   <li><strong>Plane carrying aid supplies crashes in Somalia. </strong>The accident, involving an African Express Airways plane<strong>, </strong>killed seven people on board, a security official said.</li> \n   <li><strong>US supreme court</strong><strong> hears arguments by teleconference for first time</strong>.

But all that seems like a practice run for 2020.</p> <p>In February data began emerging from northern Italy, the first place in Europe to feel the force of the novel coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan, China, in November.</p> <p>\u201cThis virus is probably the one that concerns me the most, of everything I\u2019ve worked on,\u201d Ferguson said in an early TV interview mid-February, when ministers were still focused on how they would implement Brexit.</p> <p>On 16 March, about a month after the earlier interview, Ferguson delivered a 20-page paper to Johnson which transformed the UK\u2019s strategy and has been credited with saving tens of thousands of lives.</p> <p>He told ministers that more than 500,000 people could die if the government continued with its stated strategy of allowing the disease to spread.</p> <p>Eight days later, the government scrapped the strategy in favour of suppressing the virus with a lockdown to save lives and protect the NHS.</p> <p>Ferguson\u2019s work has gone on to form the strategies pursued by the White House, in the US, and the governments of France and Germany, according to reports.</p> <p>He is dedicated to his profession, according to his colleague Christl Donnelly, a professor of statistical epidemiology based at Oxford University most of the time, as well as at Imperial. She said: \u201cHe works harder than anyone I have ever met. He is simultaneously attending very large numbers of meetings while running the group from an organisational point of view and doing programming himself. Any one of those things could take somebody their full time.</p> <p>\u201cOne of his friends said he should slow down \u2013 this is a marathon not a sprint. He said he is going to do the marathon at sprint speed. It is not just work ethic, it is also energy. He seems to be able to keep going. He must sleep a bit, but I think not much.\u201d</p> <p>Ferguson was one of a number of people at the highest levels of government to contract the virus. On 17 March, he took part in a 5pm press conference at No 10 Downing Street, greeting senior members of Johnson\u2019s cabinet before delivering a speech and leaving.</p> <p>The next morning he woke with a dry cough and tested positive for Covid-19. In the days that followed, the prime minister, his chief adviser Dominic Cummings, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, also reported symptoms of the virus.</p> <p>In a statement on Tuesday, Ferguson expressed his regret for ignoring the government\u2019s guidance.</p> <p>\u201cI acted in the belief that I was immune, having tested positive for coronavirus, and completely isolated myself for almost two weeks after developing symptoms. I deeply regret any undermining of the clear messages around the continued need for social distancing to control this devastating epidemic,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Those regrets could echo around Whitehall as ministers and senior civil servants rue the loss of an expert who transformed government policy.</p>",

  "<p>California is suing Uber and Lyft, alleging they misclassified their drivers as independent contractors under the state\u2019s new labor law, in the most significant challenge to the ride-hailing companies\u2019 employment model to date.</p> <p>Xavier Becerra, the state\u2019s attorney general, announced the lawsuit Tuesday during a news conference. The labor law, known as AB5 and considered the nation\u2019s strictest test, took effect on 1 January and makes it harder for companies to classify workers as independent contractors instead of employees who are entitled to minimum wage and benefits such as workers compensation and unemployment benefits \u2013 a key exclusion that has come to the fore during the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/19/uber-lyft-coronavirus-benefits-ab5\">Uber and Lyft drivers protest to demand more benefits during coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cUber and Lyft claim their drivers aren\u2019t engaged in the companies\u2019 core mission and cannot qualify for benefits,\u201d said Becerra. \u201cThese companies will take the workers\u2019 labor, but they won\u2019t accept the worker protections. California has ground rules with rights and protections for workers and their employers. We intend to make sure that Uber and Lyft play by the rules.\u201d</p> <p>The dispute over the employment status of Uber and Lyft drivers is as old as the companies themselves. Over the years, gig economy companies have attracted \u2013 and largely fought off or settled \u2013 a host of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/23/uber-drivers-union-settlement-contractors\">class-action lawsuits</a> over employee classification. But an enforcement lawsuit by the state, which will not have the same incentive to settle as a private plaintiff\u2019s attorney, represents an \u201cunprecedented\u201d escalation that is much more likely to bring about meaningful change, said Veena Dubal, a law professor at the University of California Hastings who researches the gig economy.</p> <p>\u201cThese companies should have never been allowed to proliferate using the business model they were using, and it was the state of California that first legalized and allowed this, so that it\u2019s the state of California that is finally stepping in and saying that these are employees is so gratifying,\u201d Dubal said in an interview.</p> <p>California represents Uber and Lyft\u2019s largest source of revenue. The companies, as well as Doordash, have invested $30m apiece in a ballot initiative campaign to exclude their drivers from the law while giving new benefits such as health care coverage. The initiative is likely to qualify for the November ballot.</p> <p>The ballot initiative campaign was the subject of a scathing reference in the legal complaint filed by the state, which lambasted the companies for launching \u201can aggressive public relations campaign in the hopes of enshrining their ability to mistreat their workers\u201d in the middle of \u201ca once-in-a-century pandemic\u201d.</p> <p>A federal judge in February denied Uber and Postmates\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction that would have exempted them from the law. But separately, a federal judge in January indefinitely blocked the law from applying to more than 70,000 independent truckers, deciding that it is preempted by federal rules on interstate commerce.</p> <p>The state legislature is also considering amending the law, though lawmakers are split whether to broaden or narrow it as other groups \u2013 such as freelance writers and photographers \u2013 contend they have been hurt by it through unintended consequences.</p> <p>The state\u2019s lawsuit alleges that Uber and Lyft haven\u2019t paid enough payroll taxes as a result of the misclassification. The suit seeks restitution for unpaid wages owed to drivers, civil penalties and a permanent ruling that would prohibit the companies from misclassifying drivers in the future.</p> <p>\u201cWe are looking forward to working with the attorney general and mayors across the state to bring all the benefits of California\u2019s innovation economy to as many workers as possible, especially during this time when the creation of good jobs with access to affordable healthcare and other benefits is more important than ever,\u201d Lyft said in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cAt a time when California\u2019s economy is in crisis with four million people out of work, we need to make it easier, not harder, for people to quickly start earning,\u201d a spokesman for Uber said in a statement. \u201cWe will contest this action in court, while at the same time pushing to raise the standard of independent work for drivers in California, including with guaranteed minimum earnings and new benefits.\u201d</p> <p><em>Agencies contributed reporting</em></p>",

  "<p>On Monday the health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/04/contact-tracing-app-to-be-piloted-on-isle-of-wight-this-week-matt-hancock-says\">the launch of a mobile phone contact tracing app</a> that is at the heart of the government\u2019s strategy for easing the coronavirus lockdown.</p> <p>It is being tested on the Isle of Wight before becoming nationally available by the end of the month.</p> <p>Using the Bluetooth capabilities in smartphones, the NHS Covid-19 Tracing app will keep records of whom a person meets. If a user or contact declares they have become ill (there is no requirement to have a test) it will send notifications to everybody on that list advising them to self-isolate.</p> <p>But the announcement of its launch immediately prompted a raft of questions, about the technology, its security \u2013 and whether the public would use it.</p> <h2>Why did the UK choose this type of app?</h2> <p>There are two possible ways a contact tracing phone app could work. One is a \u201cdecentralised\u201d model where all the relevant contact information is held only on users\u2019 phones.</p> <p>The alternative approach \u2013 the \u201ccentralised\u201d model \u2013 is where some data is held by the NHS in a single database.</p> <p>Apple and Google have tried to promote a decentralised model, arguing it is best for privacy, and have worked together to develop a set of interfaces to support a contact tracing app on that basis.</p> <p>But the NHS team developing the official tracing app rejected that approach, and instead insisted on holding a central database of those who say they have been infected.</p> <p>But this has raised concerns over privacy.</p> <p>Ian Levy, the technical director of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), <a href=\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/security-behind-nhs-contact-tracing-app\">wrote on Monday that the NHS would only hold anonymous data</a>. Each app user is assigned a unique number (the actual number changes daily) and data about people they had met would only be uploaded after they had reported feeling ill.</p> <p>This, Levy said, would allow the NHS to better \u201cunderstand how the disease appears to be spreading\u201d and have some \u201ccontact graphs to carry out some analysis\u201d \u2013 although such exercises would be limited as the only data that the app asks for is the first part of a person\u2019s postcode.</p> <h2>Is the NHS app secure?</h2> <p>It has been developed at breakneck speed \u2013 over the past two months \u2013 and while NHSX and the firm that has developed it, VMware Pivotal, have had advice from government security experts at the NCSC, there remains the possibility that there could be security flaws.</p> <p>Levy, however, argued they were minimal. He said the central system only stored a set of numbers and if you discovered \u201cmy app ID is 123456, there are some theoretical things you can do to try to understand my contacts if you\u2019ve followed me round. But if you\u2019ve followed me round, you\u2019ve probably seen my contacts anyway.\u201d</p> <p>Others have raised concerns that the central database could expand and increase the security risk. <a href=\"https://healthtech.blog.gov.uk/2020/04/24/digital-contact-tracing-protecting-the-nhs-and-saving-lives/\">Matthew Gould, the chief executive of NHSX, wrote last month</a>: \u201cIn future releases of the app, people will be able to choose to provide the NHS with extra information about themselves to help us identify hotspots and trends.\u201d</p> <p>That prompted Damian Collins MP, a former chair of the culture, media and sport select committee, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DamianCollins/status/1257625267088101376/photo/1\">to wonder whether that would make it easier to identify people in the database if it was hacked</a>. He also asked whether the centralised database should be deleted at the end of the pandemic, as Australia has committed to do.</p> <h2>Will the public cooperate and download it?</h2> <p>This is unclear and part of the purpose of the trial on the Isle of Wight to see if the public is willing to use it. A similar app that encourages people to self-report coronavirus symptoms, developed by King\u2019s College London, has more than 2.4 million users. But that represents about 3.5% of the UK population.</p> <p>Oxford University\u2019s Big Data Institute has estimated that <a href=\"https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/news/digital-contact-tracing-can-slow-or-even-stop-coronavirus-transmission-and-ease-us-out-of-lockdown\">if 60% of the population adopted the NHS app then it could help \u201csubstantially reduce\u201d</a> the number of new coronavirus cases alongside other relevant measures to control the disease \u2013 and help the UK come out of lockdown relatively safely.</p> <p>Few, however, believe the NHS app will prove that popular at first. Those who have helped to develop it at NHSX admit in private that the speed at which they have had to work has made it difficult to sell the need for the app to the public and properly reassure citizens about its privacy and security.</p> <p>On Monday, Gould told MPs: \u201cEven if the takeup rate is 20%, that gives us important insights into how the virus is spreading.\u201d That may be more realistic, although that means takeup would be roughly in line with Singapore, a country with a markedly higher respect for the state.</p> <h2>Can it be enforced?</h2> <p>There are no plans to enforce takeup at the moment. Nor is it clear what the immediate incentive is, either. People living in the Isle of Wight will not see an early easing of the nationwide lockdown so their reason to get involved would need to be a desire to test the app on behalf of the rest of the country.</p> <p>Ultimately, however, effective coronavirus monitoring, testing and tracing will be at the heart of a suite of strategies to ease the lockdown \u2013 and already those involved in its development are appealing to Britons\u2019 sense of civic duty.</p> <p>As Gould has put it: \u201cIf you want to keep your family and yourselves safe, if you want to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed and at the same time want to get the country back and the economy moving, the app is going to be an essential part of that strategy.\u201d</p> <p>There is another issue: what if the app tells someone they need to self-isolate, and they don\u2019t? So far, there has been no discussion about how you persuade people to abide by the warning.</p>",

  "<p>One of the most immediate and unavoidable consequences of the coronavirus pandemic was that \u201cpolitics as usual\u201d quickly ground to a shuddering halt. In Britain, mayoral and council elections due to be held this week were postponed for a year.</p> <p>A democratic hiatus of this kind is never to be welcomed. But delaying an election in order to conduct it properly is far preferable to the current state of affairs in Poland. This Sunday, as Poles tentatively emerge from two months of lockdown and continue to physically distance, an electorate <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Polish_parliamentary_election\" title=\"\">of</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Polish_parliamentary_election\" title=\"\">more than 30</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Polish_parliamentary_election\" title=\"\"> million people</a> is due to elect a new president by postal vote \u2013 the first such poll in the nation\u2019s history. The date of the election was fixed in pre-coronavirus times. By insisting that it goes ahead, the rightwing Law and Justice-led government has taken the maxim \u201cnever let a crisis go to waste\u201d to a new level.</p> <p>The decision to hold an improvised postal election is being contested by all the opposition parties. Key allies in Law and Justice\u2019s own ruling coalition also oppose the move; the deputy prime minister, Jaros\u0142aw Gowin, <a href=\"https://euobserver.com/tickers/147999\" title=\"\">resigned in protest</a> last month, arguing that the country should be focused on battling coronavirus and rebuilding the economy. The other objections are numerous. There are enormous practical difficulties to organising an unprecedented ballot in such a short space of time and widespread concerns over possible fraud. Since ordinary campaigning on the streets has been impossible for two months, there are also issues of political balance, given the <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/11/25/poland-public-television-law-and-justice-pis-mouthpiece/\" title=\"\">pro-government affiliations</a> of Polish broadcast media.</p> <p>The simplest explanation for the government\u2019s determination to press ahead regardless is naked opportunism. Since taking power in 2015, Law and Justice has acquired a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/04/29/world/europe/29reuters-eu-poland.html\" title=\"\">well-deserved reputation</a> for playing fast and loose with democratic norms, particularly in relation to the judiciary and media. In this instance, it appears the party has calculated that in times of national crisis, populations tend to rally round the government. In April, it rushed a bill through parliament to allow a postal ballot poll, ignoring a legal prohibition on rule changes less than six months from an election. From then on, the political playing field has been relentlessly skewed in favour of the government\u2019s preferred candidate, Andrzej Duda, who is seeking a second presidential term. Mr Duda has enjoyed a high-profile role in the government\u2019s strategy to combat Covid-19, receiving plaudits from government-friendly media. The candidate for Civic Platform, Poland\u2019s main opposition party, has endorsed a mass boycott of the election while, confusingly, staying in the race. Unsurprisingly, given that backdrop, polls suggest that Mr Duda is set to win by a landslide.</p> <p>With the country split over the vote, and Sunday\u2019s election in danger of descending into farce, it is still possible that Poland\u2019s parliament <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2020/05/05/polands-presidential-election-will-the-government-collapse/\" title=\"\">will overturn the earlier decision</a> to allow it to take place. On legal, logistical and ethical grounds that would be the right course of action. A pandemic is not the appropriate context for an experiment in postal voting that has no credibility among large swathes of the electorate. In the interests of democracy, this election should be postponed.</p>",

  "<p>Britain could exit the coronavirus lockdown by relaxing restrictions on more than half of the population and beefing up protection for those over 70 and vulnerable people, scientists have said.</p> \n<p>The strategy from researchers at Edinburgh University, known as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ed.ac.uk/covid-19-response/latest-news/two-tier-approach-could-begin-lockdown-end\">segmenting and shielding</a>\u201d, is intended to create leeway for ministers to ease the lockdown on those least at risk from the virus while ensuring that vulnerable people only come into contact with carers and family members who are free from infection.</p> \n<p>The Edinburgh proposal, which has been submitted to ministers, could see millions of people afforded more freedom to move around and return to work while protecting older people and those with underlying health problems to prevent a surge of new infections from overwhelming the NHS.</p> \n<p>Ministers are cautious about the idea of extending the lockdown for people over 70 while giving more freedom to younger people because Tory MPs are unhappy with the idea and campaign groups argue that it amounts to discrimination. The former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said: \u201cA lot of people over 70 are fit and have kept themselves fit, often more so than people of other ages. There has been a backlash and people don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right way to go about it.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>However, it emerged on Tuesday that the government\u2019s scientists in March modelled an extended lockdown of 17 weeks for older people compared with eight to 13 weeks for the rest of society, as part of their advice on how to contain coronavirus.</p> \n<p>Papers newly released by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) showed it looked at the impact of a 17-week lockdown for those either over 65, over 70 or over 80. It said the outcome for a longer lockdown for people over 70 was a reduction in deaths of up to 35% \u2013 or up to 50% if combined with other measures such as isolation of those showing symptoms and their households.</p> \n<p>Ministers are understood to have considered the idea of different rules for older people, and Matt Hancock, the health secretary, did not rule it out when pressed about the idea on Tuesday. A spokesman for No 10 also said this week it was \u201cperfectly reasonable that we will look at how guidance will apply for different age bands and we\u2019ll continue to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/government-response-to-coronavirus-led-by-science-grant-shapps\">guided by the science</a>\u201d, and stressed that there was a higher risk of coronavirus having a more serious impact for people as they got older.</p> \n<p>The government is expected to announce on Thursday that the lockdown will have to continue for the time being. Boris Johnson will set out plans for the next phase of tackling the virus on Sunday, including how restrictions could be lifted when it is safe to do so.

In a study outlining the strategy, the researchers describe a number of scenarios where the measures come into force over a three-month period.</p> \n<p>In one scenario, the most vulnerable 20% of society only come into contact with a further 20%, the shielders, who are made up of healthcare workers and family contacts. Ideally, the shielders would be tested for coronavirus every day they intend to be in contact with vulnerable people.</p> \n<p>With the measures in place, restrictions could be relaxed for the remaining 60% of society, though physical distancing and hand hygiene would still be needed to prevent the reproductive rate of the infection, R, rising so high it sets off a second uncontrolled outbreak.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e60c6aea-b500-4a5a-b6af-b1d99f7d0511\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>R, or the 'effective reproduction number', is a way of rating a disease\u2019s ability to spread.

  "<h2>Broadcast</h2> <p>Football is by far the most important sport on TV. If you\u2019re going to spend money on rights it\u2019s got to be on football and it\u2019s got to be the Premier League first, then the Champions League. Before the crisis hit, however, you were getting to a position where broadcasters were beginning to lose money on football. In the UK, Premier League rights had gone so high that BT and Sky Sports were looking to control their costs.</p> <p>The next round of Premier League rights were therefore expected to go down a bit, as they had in the previous round. But a collapse was not being expected. Demand was still there from customers and broadcasters would still pay out for these rights.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/04/efl-football-is-a-trillion-dollar-industry-it-cant-die-darragh-macanthony-peterborough\">Hard choices in the EFL: 'Football is a trillion-dollar industry. It can't die'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At this moment it\u2019s hard to see that things have massively changed. Yet while we\u2019d like to all think things will be back to normal soon, there\u2019s no guarantee. Pubs and clubs, which are a reasonably serious part of the economics, are not going to bounce back for many months. Sky has stopped taking money from these customers while there\u2019s no sport to show and I imagine this will continue. Residential consumers have also been given a fairly easy online pause mechanism; following the logic that if you get people to pause they will come back, but if you cancel you will have to chase them.</p> <p>So expect some bounce-back. To some extent there\u2019s a protection to pay-TV and particularly sports. In Europe, during difficult economic times, sports is what we go back to. But that\u2019s not necessarily the case outside Europe and outside your domestic league within Europe. If pay-TV companies are struggling around the world, non-domestic rights is what they\u2019re going to cut first. A consumer-led recession could also impact on the economics at BT and Sky.</p> <p>There is another aspect to the economics, however. Big Premier League clubs have fairly diversified income. They get a bunch from broadcasting, a bunch from commercial sponsorship and a bunch from matchday. It\u2019s not far off a third of their total revenues each. A club at the bottom end of the Premier League, meanwhile, typically has a much smaller stadium and much less commercial activity. They are more dependent on broadcast income but also less dependent on overseas commercial deals. In the aftermath of Covid-19, this might have the effect of evening the playing field a little bit.</p> <p><em>James Barford, director of telecoms, Enders Analysis.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2950b4c514c89d976a208045d55d8e92eaa81e3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2950b4c514c89d976a208045d55d8e92eaa81e3b/0_0_4421_2948/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sky Sports\u2019 Kelly Cates and Gary Neville find some shelter at St Mary\u2019s Stadium.

If we went into lockdown on one side of the us/them divide then some of those divisions seem to have been blurred, if not removed, with clubs and journalists treating each other with far more compassion and respect. It would be great to imagine we\u2019ll all remember just how understanding we\u2019ve been with each other and take that as a new starting point.</p> <p><em>James Cooper, Sky Sports News correspondent.</em></p> <h2>Sponsorship</h2> <p>The full implications of the coronavirus pandemic for sponsorship are starting to emerge and resolving some of the likely issues could be crucial for some clubs\u2019 hopes of surviving. There are two sides to any contract: football clubs not delivering their obligations in terms of not being able to promote sponsored products because they aren\u2019t playing matches and also for the sponsors not being linked to the football club. There is a potential breach of contract from the club\u2019s point of view but equally they may have relatively watertight contracts and feel that if they are not being paid then there are problems at the other end.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/05/efl-chief-parachute-payments-evil-eradicated-football\">EFL chief says parachute payments are 'an evil that must be eradicated'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whether that means sponsors may ask for some of the money back, much will depend on what each club is committed to do. A lot of the time it involves players travelling to the sponsor and having photos taken in their kit and things of that nature. That element of the contact can\u2019t be fulfilled so sponsors may be asking for their money back or they may be physically unable to pay. We saw that with West Ham\u2019s sleeve sponsor finance firm Basset &amp; Gold [which went into administration in April].</p> <p>The Premier League clubs aren\u2019t out of the woods given their significant wage bills. But lower down the pyramid in Leagues One and Two where clubs rely more on income from match days, they are really hurting at present. The nature of the sponsors at that level also tends to be different; they aren\u2019t global companies like Chevrolet at Manchester United for example or betting companies like you see in the top two divisions. If you are being sponsored by a local business then that business itself is likely to be suffering as a result of the pandemic and therefore will not be able to pay its next instalment.<br><em>Kieran Maguire, senior teacher at the University of Liverpool\u2019s Management School and specialist in football finance.

While Eventmasters services are offered on a match-by-match basis, as is the case with other major suppliers, we are contracted with clubs on a seasonal basis and we\u2019ll need to consider our level of commitment to them due to the uncertainty regarding a return.

Of those, the five biggest greenhouse gas emitters \u2013 Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany and Turkey \u2013 are targeted in the lawsuit, which has been brought by the children with the backing of the green campaigning group Earthjustice and the international law firm Hausfeld.</p> <p>There has been no decision yet from the UN committee on whether to hear the legal complaint.</p> <p>The lawsuit joins a growing number of attempts to bring climate cases to court, alleging that government or businesses have flouted the law or failed in their international obligations. One of the most successful has been in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/24/dutch-government-ordered-cut-carbon-emissions-landmark-ruling\">Netherlands, in the Urgenda case</a>, in which judges found the government must change its policies to tackle emissions and the climate crisis.</p> <p>In the UK, campaigners brought a successful legal challenge that found the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/27/heathrow-third-runway-ruled-illegal-over-climate-change\">government was wrong to allow the expansion of Heathrow</a> airport without taking into account its obligations under the Paris agreement.

  "<p>A prisoner convicted of stirring up religious hatred has won the first round in his legal challenge to emergency legislation preventing early automatic release of terrorism offenders.</p> <p>Lawyers for Mohammed Zahir Khan, who is serving four-and-a-half years, are arguing that the Terrorist Offenders (Restriction of Early Release) Act, which only became law in February, discriminates against Muslims.</p> <p>In a high court hearing conducted over remote video links, Hugh Southey QC, representing Khan, said terrorist prisoners are being treated differently from other inmates and that the regulations breached his human rights.</p> <p>The new rules, which require those convicted of terror offences to spend two-thirds of their term in jail before being considered for release, are directed against those holding \u201cparticular Islamic beliefs\u201d and have a \u201cdisproportionate impact\u201d on Muslims, the court was told.</p> <p>Under the previous regime, Khan would have been eligible for automatic release in February 2020. He is now due to be considered for release in November 2020.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Mr Justice Garnham ruled that Khan had an \u201carguable case\u201d and that his claim should now be fully analysed at a trial. The challenge, he said, raised a matter of \u201csome considerable\u201d importance and public interest. \u201cIt needs to be dealt with quickly,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Khan, who is in his early 40s and originally from Birmingham, had been running a shop in Sunderland when he was arrested. He was sentenced at Newcastle crown court in May 2018 after being convicted of encouraging terrorism and stirring up religious hatred. He admitted encouraging acts of terror and inciting religious hatred via social media.</p> <p>The terrorist offenders (restriction of early release) bill was introduced into parliament the day after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/02/streatham-terror-incident-man-shot-by-police-in-south-london\">a recently freed terror offender, Sudesh Amman</a>, launched a knife attack in Streatham, south London. Just over three weeks later the bill became law. It was the second attack in the space of three months involving a recently released terrorist,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/03/london-bridge-attack-girlfriend-praises-phenomenal-jack-merritt\"> following Usman Khan\u2019s killing of two people near London Bridge</a>.</p> <p>Hugh Southey QC, who led Khan\u2019s legal team, said the legislation amended an early release regime and extended the \u201crequisite custodial period\u201d. It meant those convicted of terror offences could only be released on licence after a parole board had considered their case.</p> <p>Southey said the regulations were \u201cunlawfully discriminatory\u201d and breached rights enshrined in the European convention on human rights \u2013 the right to liberty and the right not to be held guilty of an offence which did not constitute an offence when it was committed.</p> <p>\u201cAccording to the law in force at the time of sentence, he should be entitled to automatic early release at [the] halfway stage of his sentence,\u201d Southey said.</p> <p>But Sir James Eadie QC, representing the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, said the challenge should be dismissed. The legislation was not discriminatory, he added. The new provisions applied equally to all terrorist offenders, regardless of \u201crace, religion or otherwise\u201d.</p> <p>In a written submission to the court, Eadie argued: \u201cThe 2020 act pursues the legitimate aim of protecting the public from dangerous offenders, by ensuring that they are kept in custody for a longer proportion of the penalty part of their sentence.</p> <p>\u201cWhere a prisoner is considered by the Parole Board to continue to pose a risk to the public, they will not be released but instead will continue to be detained for the whole of the penalty part of their sentence, as originally imposed by the sentencing court.\u201d</p> <p>Sir James said parliament was entitled to conclude that terrorist offenders were \u201cto be distinguished on the basis of immediate and significant risk materialising\u201d and the \u201cdifficulties in identifying and managing this risk\u201d.</p> <p>A full trial of the issues is expected in the coming months.<br><br></p>",

Meanwhile, doctors at University hospitals Birmingham NHS trust \u2013 serving a city which has suffered more coronavirus deaths than any outside London \u2013 are pressing ahead with their own review.</p> <p>Dr Adnan Sharif, a consultant nephrologist at Queen Elizabeth hospital, said: \u201cBirmingham is a single local authority, over a million people on its books with a large, 42%, BAME community which has been impacted by Covid a lot, so it would be the best place to try to do this.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure what the remit of the [national] inquiry is apart from being in the headlines.

So for example, how many occupants there are in the houses, benefit claimants, council tax band etc and all that kind of social level kind of data and trying to link it to Covid cases, hospital admissions. I think it\u2019s that kind of level of granular data that you need to get to from an epidemiological perspective to look at this.\u201d</p> <p>Overcrowded accommodation, one element of social deprivation, has been cited as possible contributory factors to increased death rates among BAME people, as the bigger the household, the more the sources of possible exposure to coronavirus.</p> <p>Nearly a third of the UK Bangladeshi population are considered to live in overcrowded housing, as well as 15% of people of a black African background and 16% of British Pakistanis, compared with 2% of the white British population.</p> <p>Sharif said the response from the council had been encouraging and the public health department was looking into what it could provide.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a rapidly changing environment, it\u2019s difficult to really gauge reality and I think that\u2019s why everybody is just so keen to try to get as much information as possible,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p><br>My friend John O\u2019Malley, who has died aged 81, was a creative community organiser and a staunch supporter of human rights, who lived his politics through his personal life as well as through his wider contributions to social justice and international solidarity.</p> <p>In the 1970s John led the Canning Town Community Development Project (CDP) in Newham, east London, part of a national government programme to tackle poverty and deprivation. At a national level, he was a key player in the CDP\u2019s Inter-Project Team, producing a groundbreaking analysis of the underlying causes of poverty and deprivation.</p> <p>In 1973 John undertook a secret mission in apartheid South Africa to distribute leaflets on behalf of the banned African National Congress. It was a dangerous undertaking as he and his companion for the trip were risking their liberty and their lives. Only many years later, with the publication of Ken Keable\u2019s The London Recruits, did John find out about others who had taken similar risks for the same cause.</p> <p>He was elected in the mid-1980s to Lambeth council, part of the group that made a principled stand against rate-capping policies which would have had the heaviest impact on those least able to bear the consequences. As a result, he and 30 others were fined.</p> <p>In the late 1980s John was chair of the development committee at the Inner London Education Authority, with a London\u2013wide remit to restructure secondary school provision to reflect demographic changes and community needs. John was particularly concerned with children\u2019s educational rights. In recent years, until his retirement in 2007, he used his expertise in education law to work as an advocate representing excluded children and their families.</p> <p>John was born in Harrow, north-west London, to Marjorie (nee Muir), a teacher, and Robert O\u2019Malley, a civil engineer working at the Ministry of Transport. John attended Harrow county school for boys and went on to study mathematics at Manchester University, where his interest in politics and social justice developed into what became a lifelong commitment.</p> <p>After university, he returned to London to do a PGCE teaching qualification at the Institute of Education and this enabled him to get actively involved in community politics. Much later, in 1999, John achieved a postgraduate certificate in education law from the University of Buckingham, as this is where his professional expertise had been developed through his careers in various capacities.</p> <p>John met Jan Speight in 1962 through CND; they married four years later.

His comments prompted Prague city council to agree to allow the Jewish community to inspect the site once the latest redevelopment started.</p> <p>\u201cWe feel this is a victory for us because until now this was just a rumour.

  "<p>Television screens tuned into the Philippines\u2019 biggest broadcaster ABS-CBN went blank on Tuesday evening, after the network was forced off air by a cease-and-desist order that has been condemned as a brazen attack on press freedom.</p> <p>The media group, which has been repeatedly attacked by the country\u2019s president, Rodrigo Duterte, has faced months of uncertainty over its future. An application to renew its franchise, a requirement in order to continue operations, had been delayed in congress.</p> <p>It had been expected that the network would be allowed to continue broadcasting during the coronavirus lockdown, when access to reliable information is crucial to public health. Millions of people living in the country\u2019s capital and main cities remain under quarantine measures until mid-May.</p> <p>On Tuesday, however, the network went off air just before 8pm, following the decision by the country\u2019s telecoms body, National Telecommunications Commission. Its 25-year congressional franchise ended on Monday.</p> <p>Danilo Arao, a journalism professor at the University of the Philippines, said the order was likely to have a chilling effect on journalism in the Philippines.</p> <p>\u201cThe government has hated ABS-CBN right from the very start but somehow we were expecting that it would not be so brazen, given the need for timely information. ABS-CBN, hate it or not, you cannot discount that its reach is very, very far in terms of its listenership and viewership,\u201d said Arao.</p> <p>\u201c[The order] will send a strong message to other journalists and news media organisations that if you continue with critical reportage, or even if you are at the crosshairs of the powers that be, you might end up like ABS-CBN,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Duterte has repeatedly threatened to stop ABS-CBN, and previously accused it of failing to broadcast his campaign advertisements and not returning the payments. In a speech in December, he taunted the network, stating: \u201cABS-CBN, your contract is about to expire. If I were you, you\u2019re better off selling it \u2026 I will make sure that you will remember this episode of our times for ever.\u201d</p> <p>In February, government lawyers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/10/philippines-moves-strip-biggest-media-group-franchise-abs-cbn\">moved to strip the media group</a> of its franchise by filing a petition with the country\u2019s top court alleging that it had violated rules on foreign ownership.</p> <p>Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said in a statement on Tuesday that Duterte had left the fate of its franchise to Congress, adding that \u201cABS-CBN\u2019s continued operation is entirely with the NTC\u2019s decision\u201d. Duterte had accepted an apology from the network in relation to a disagreement over advertisements, he said.</p> <p>Media groups point out that the network has provided critical coverage of Duterte\u2019s presidency, including his brutal anti-drugs crackdown in which thousands of people were killed.</p> <p>It is not the first time that ABS-CBN has been shut down. In September 1972, the company\u2019s headquarters were seized and its channels used to relay government propaganda, after then-Philippines president Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law. It reopened 14 years later, when Marcos was toppled.</p> <p>More recently, media freedom in the Philippines has declined under Duterte, and the country now ranks 136th out of 180 countries on the Reporters Without Borders\u2019 (RSF) <a href=\"https://rsf.org/en/philippines\">World Press Freedom Index</a>. Its analysis cited threats of violence against journalists, online harassment campaigns waged by pro-Duterte troll armies and the multiple legal charges facing the website Rappler and its editor, Maria Ressa.</p> <p>Ressa described Tuesday\u2019s decision as \u201ca death knell and a call to action\u201d, adding: \u201cWe stand with ABS-CBN and all journalists who continue to shine the light and expose wrongdoing despite state-sponsored efforts to silence them,\u201d she said.</p> <p>ABS-CBN, which employs more than 11,000 people, has 10 days to respond and say why frequencies assigned to it should not be recalled, according to the order. Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/nation/259978-doj-says-cease-desist-order-vs-abs-cbn-immediately-executory?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=Echobox&amp;utm_source=Facebook&amp;fbclid=IwAR0ZYBl2Pz7q3XhVhUpc4lpJffuJW4qBD34LO3fKfgHtpqYu4xGmsd6SPS0#Echobox=1588671376\">said the decision</a> could be appealed in the courts, Rappler reported.</p> <p>In a statement, the network said millions of Filipinos will lose their source of news and entertainment at a moment when \u201cpeople need crucial and timely information as the nation deals with the Covid-19 pandemic\u201d.</p>",
  "<h2>Seth Meyers</h2> <p>As several states began tentative, and risky, reopening measures, Donald Trump held a town hall at the Lincoln Memorial on Sunday night exclusively for Fox News \u2013 which \u201cmakes sense\u201d, said Seth Meyers on Late Night, because Trump is \u201cconstantly either in a state of watching Fox or appearing on Fox or watching himself appearing on Fox.

The hiring of McEnany, a former Fox production assistant, epitomizes \u201cthe feedback loop of disinformation and propaganda that exists between the Trump White House and Fox News\u201d, said Meyers. McEnany is known, for example, for defending Trump on cable news in February with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/08/kayleigh-mcenany-donald-trump-press-secretary-quotes\">\u201coutlandish lies\u201d</a> such as \u201cthis president will always put America first, he will always protect American citizens, we will not see diseases like the coronavirus come here\u201d.</p> <p>Fox News also played a destructive role in what the Washington Post called Trump\u2019s \u201clost month\u201d of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/34-days-of-pandemic-inside-trumps-desperate-attempts-to-reopen-america/2020/05/02/e99911f4-8b54-11ea-9dfd-990f9dcc71fc_story.html\">\u201cdesperation and dysfunction\u201d</a> as he ignored and then gave up on fighting coronavirus and instead focused, at the behest of aides and his favorite Fox News hosts, on prematurely opening up the economy. The Post reports that frequent Fox News guest and \u201cTrump\u2019s toothless vampire\u201d Rudy Giuliani and host Laura Ingraham lobbied the president repeatedly, in White House meetings and on air, to embrace the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine (\u201cRemember when everyone cared about that for a second? The Tamagotchi of Covid cures,\u201d said Meyers) as a coronavirus treatment (it is not proven and can have fatal side-effects). \u201cYeah, the TV president who played a TV businessman is listening to TV doctors,\u201d Meyers said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/01/stephen-colbert-trump-coronavirus-late-show-recap\">Colbert: Trump 'wants everything to go back to normal because he\u2019s bored'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Still, it\u2019s confirmation that \u201ca Fox host with no medical expertise [Ingraham] is directly advising the president on a deadly pandemic, while that same president hires pundits he sees on TV and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/rick-bright-trump-hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus\">fires or punishes actual experts</a> and inspector generals who criticize him\u201d, said Meyers. \u201cThis is what you get when you make a TV star president.

  "<p>Deja vu. In recent days I\u2019ve had that sense more than once. Every time I come home, remove my mask and wash my hands, I start thinking whether it is safe to keep on wearing the clothes that I had on outside. What if they are contaminated by the virus? Well, I can change clothes, but what if the particles have already jumped somewhere else, and are now in my home? Some would call it paranoia. I call it deja vu. I recognise those thoughts and remember the feelings.</p> <p>That is because I first experienced them more than 30 years ago, in May 1986, on a trip to Kyiv, then the capital of Soviet Ukraine. It was a few weeks after the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, and I was in the city \u2013 about 100km from the disaster area \u2013 on a business trip. We already knew that there was radiation in the air. Water trucks were spraying the streets, foreign students were leaving the city, and overseas broadcasters like the BBC were telling us to stay inside. But our own government was sending confusing and distressing messages: there is absolutely no danger, but make sure you keep children inside, and pregnant women too. Oh, and close your windows when you are at home.</p> <p>Then, as now, we were dealing with an invisible enemy, trying to figure out where particles that we could not see might go. Then, as now, the world had to deal with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/deadly-virus-britain-failed-prepare-mers-sars-ebola-coronavirus\">man-made disaster</a>; the inability of the government that had facilitated the disaster through neglect, not design, to undo it; and the world\u2019s confused and inconsistent reaction to a catastrophe not of its making. Today, as in 1986, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-misinformation-health-advice\">people are frightened and disoriented</a>, trying to fight something that they can\u2019t see, hear, touch or smell, even though it has already changed our lives.</p> <p>What was true then still seems true today: disasters know no borders, no matter how many walls we try to build between us and the rest of the world. In the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident, observers noted that it had made the iron curtain obsolete. Indeed, in the days after the explosion, the radioactive cloud moved not just beyond the USSR but even beyond the outer Soviet empire, passing across the eastern bloc into western Europe. It reached Scandinavia on 28 April 1986, two days after the explosion, and triggered alarms at a nuclear power plant near Uppsala, Sweden. The world learned about rising radiation levels <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20140514STO47018/forsmark-how-sweden-alerted-the-world-about-the-danger-of-chernobyl-disaster\">from Stockholm before Moscow said anything</a>.</p> <p>From Chernobyl, radioactive rain carried unruly isotopes of strontium-90 and caesium-137, to name only two, not only to neighbouring Belarus and western Russia, or to Scandinavia, but also to the Balkans, Austria, Germany and Switzerland, and to parts of Wales, England and large areas of Scotland. The mighty Soviet Union could not control the clouds and ultimately lost control of the narrative as well.</p> <p>Does that sound familiar? As it struggled to deal with a homegrown disaster that was becoming international, Beijing in 2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/feb/25/could-coronavirus-be-china-chernobyl-moment-podcast\">closely resembled Moscow in 1986</a>. Like Moscow\u2019s terse initial report about the Chernobyl disaster, Beijing\u2019s announcement about the outbreak of Covid-19 came late, was incomplete, and had all the hallmarks of a coverup. Like the Soviet Union responding to the Chernobyl explosion, China mobilised huge domestic resources and introduced draconian measures to deal with the outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan. But neither of the two governments, which happened to be communist and authoritarian in different degrees, managed to stop the spread of the disaster <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/11/china-clamping-down-on-coronavirus-research-deleted-pages-suggest\">and information about it</a> beyond their borders. And the misleading reports and mismanagement then produced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/republicans-face-backlash-racist-labeling-coronavirus-china-wuhan\">backlash among foreign governments</a> and the general public throughout the world.</p> <p>China, which pretended to the status of world leader in matters of globalisation and climate change only a few months before the Wuhan disaster, has had its reputation damaged. It also faces <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/22/missouri-sues-china-for-not-doing-enough-to-stop-coronavirus-spread\">trillion-dollar class-action lawsuits</a> originating in the United States and calls for a billion dollars in reparations from Germany. However effective they are at mobilising resources to deal with disasters, authoritarian regimes turn out to be too effective for their own good in controlling information. Lack of freedom of speech helps to turn potential disasters into real ones and national tragedies into international cataclysms.</p> <p>But as we try to contain the \u201cfallout\u201d of coronavirus, many are already asking what steps we might take to better prepare ourselves next time, and avoid the next tragedy taking the same trajectory. So far, the response has been almost exclusively nation-based. Borders have been closed and fingers pointed, not just at China but at international institutions as well. President Trump has suspended funding for the World Health Organization, blaming it, at least in part, for the failure to contain the virus. While temporary border closures have their practical purposes, national self-isolation accompanied by a blame game that undermines multilateral organisations is neither a way out of the current pandemic nor a template for dealing with future disasters.</p> <p>Instead, the way forward, as demonstrated by lessons learned from Chernobyl, is through coordinated action. While some take aim at WHO for its cosy relationship with the Chinese government, it\u2019s worth remembering that the the International Atomic Energy Agency, rightly criticised at the time for facilitating the Soviet coverup of Chernobyl, eventually became the instrument by which Moscow came clean about what happened. It led the international effort to open the Soviet nuclear industry to the world and helped to introduce safety standards behind the iron curtain. A number of international legal instruments to ensure that there is early warning of nuclear accidents were adopted in the aftermath of Chernobyl, as were various measures to heighten the safety of the nuclear industry. It is my personal conviction that without those measures we would have had further Chernobyl-type accidents in the former Soviet space.</p> <p>Legal experts suggest that the lawsuits being prepared in the US will go nowhere, given the nature of international law and foreign governments\u2019 liabilities under it. And one need not be an expert to realise that cutting funds to international institutions such as the WHO in today\u2019s interconnected world is extremely damaging. On the contrary, we need to strengthen international institutions in their capacity to fight pandemics and provide the WHO with a stronger mandate to act in closed societies such as China.</p> <p>The only effective responses to international disasters, no matter which state they occur in, are international. As the world\u2019s reaction to Chernobyl showed, coordinated efforts can bring real change, making us all safer \u2013 whether we live in Beijing, Moscow, London or New York. That\u2019s the kind of deja vu I\u2019d like to be experiencing right now.</p> <p>\u2022 Serhii Plokhy is professor of history at Harvard University and the author of Chernobyl: History of a Tragedy</p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>The coronavirus map of Europe makes one thing clear: the richer nations of western Europe have suffered more from the virus than countries in the eastern half of the EU, almost without exceptions.</p> \n<p>Comparing figures from different countries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/is-comparing-covid-19-death-rates-across-europe-helpful-\">can be fraught with difficulty</a>, and many factors can potentially skew the numbers. But the comparison between western Europe on the one hand, and central and eastern Europe on the other, shows a difference in coronavirus rates that is too stark to ignore.</p> \n<p>Even the worst-hit central and eastern European countries have infection and death rates per million inhabitants much lower than western European nations, and in some the statistics are truly remarkable: Slovakia has recorded just 1,413 confirmed cases and 25 deaths. Neighbouring Austria, widely regarded as having tackled the challenge of the virus successfully, nevertheless has more than 10 times the number of infections and 20 times the deaths as Slovakia, with a population less than twice the size.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2020-05-05T12:54:00/embed.html\" data-alt=\"death rates\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2020-05-05T12:54:00/embed.html\">death rates</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Numerous contributing causes have been mooted for the discrepancy in various individual countries: lower life expectancy meaning fewer vulnerable elderly people still alive, lower population density, fewer flights to China, lower testing rates or even just sheer luck.

While in Britain and other western European nations, public events and gatherings were still going on in the second and third weeks of March, in central and eastern Europe, governments saw what was happening in Italy and implemented rapid lockdowns.</p> \n<p>In many places, fear of underfunded and struggling healthcare systems being quickly overwhelmed helped with decisiveness.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2020-05-05T12:54:52/embed.html\" data-alt=\"lockdown dates\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2020-05-05T12:54:52/embed.html\">lockdown dates</a> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe likes of Sweden and the UK had a greater sense that they could weigh up a range of policy choices rather than being bounced by the situation into preventing an absolute meltdown of their healthcare systems,\u201d said Ben Stanley, a political scientist at Warsaw\u2019s SWPS University.</p> \n<p>This also made populations more willing to follow the orders, with fewer of the dissenting voices seen in western Europe or the US. \u201cIt was exactly the fact we felt vulnerable about our healthcare system that made people follow the lockdown.

  "<p>Last Wednesday, aerial photographs captured a snaking queue, 4km long, of thousands of hungry residents from shantytowns outside Pretoria in South Africa awaiting food packages from a charity organisation. There was a chilling resonance with the images of 27 April 1994, 26 years ago, when citizens lined up to vote for the first time, and put Nelson Mandela into power.</p> <p>Today\u2019s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has vowed to find a balance between saving \u201clives <em>and</em> livelihoods\u201d in his government\u2019s response to Covid-19. And he has done well so far with the former. South Africa has been justly lauded for acting quickly to flatten the curve, delaying the pandemic\u2019s exponential trajectory with one of the world\u2019s strictest lockdowns, now in week six, so that it could screen people in hotspots and prepare its ill-equipped health system to manage the load.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There have been nearly 120,000 arrests for non-compliance, and at least two people have been murdered by security forces</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But in a country that now faces unemployment shooting up to <a href=\"https://ewn.co.za/2020/05/04/sa-s-unemployment-rate-could-possibly-reach-40-due-to-covid-19-mogajane\">more than 40%</a>, according to the government\u2019s own estimates, Ramaphosa\u2019s balance is increasingly hard to strike. And the rigid and unexplained way the government began this week\u2019s easing of the lockdown has brought its admirable reliance on science, and sense of empathy, up against its own political baggage. This has caused a perhaps inevitable fraying of common purpose in this fractious country.</p> <p>Although the curve has been flattened \u2013 only 6,336 confirmed infections by the end of last week, and 133 deaths, in a population of 58 million people \u2013 a wave of infections at some point this year is almost inevitable. All the state can do is delay it. Given that, does it make sense to keep schools and the economy largely shut, and to deny certain freedoms too? The restrictions include a strict nightly curfew, limited and illogical exercise hours, and a total ban on alcohol and tobacco sales.</p> <p>As a direct result of the alcohol ban, and the closure of the ubiquitous shebeens, the trauma wards of the major hospitals are largely empty: in South Africa, many injuries are a result of drinking, from fights to road injuries. The tobacco ban is harder to justify, and the industry has declared a legal challenge. Sin taxes are high, and the finance minister, Tito Mboweni, has <a href=\"[https://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2020-04-30-tito-mboweni-reveals-he-does-not-support-ban-on-alcohol-and-cigarette-sales/\">complained publicly</a> about the bans: he is losing \u00a370m a month at a time he can ill-afford it, given the \u00a35bn he has to find in the state coffers as part of a projected <a href=\"https://mg.co.za/article/2020-04-21-ramaphosa-announces-r500-billion-covid-19-package-for-south-africa/\">\u00a317</a><a href=\"https://mg.co.za/article/2020-04-21-ramaphosa-announces-r500-billion-covid-19-package-for-south-africa/\">b</a><a href=\"https://mg.co.za/article/2020-04-21-ramaphosa-announces-r500-billion-covid-19-package-for-south-africa/\">n bailout</a>.</p> <p>Ramaphosa has a background in both the trade union movement and the corporate world, and he ran the negotiations that brought about democracy in South Africa. He has used the pandemic to accelerate his ideology of \u201csocial compacting\u201d \u2013 bringing government, business, civil society and labour together \u2013 and has been astonishingly successful at getting big business to pitch into the bailout. He has presented the lockdown restrictions to his compatriots with a kind of mournful compassion, apologising for the tough decisions he has had to make.</p> <p>But this trust is being rapidly eroded by the actions of some of his ministers. The police minister, Bheki Cele, in particular, has brought a martial swagger to the table, threatening harsh retribution for contravening lockdown regulations. It is not surprising the UN Commission for Human Rights has explicitly called South Africa out for using <a href=\"https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2020-04-30-lockdown-curfew-overkill/\">undue force in the lockdown</a>; there have been nearly 120,000 arrests for non-compliance, and at least two people have been murdered by security forces. </p> <p>The minister responsible for managing the state of disaster, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, lectured the country last week in a castigating tone. Dlamini-Zuma is the ex-wife of the former president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/zuma\">Jacob Zuma</a>, and narrowly lost the ANC leadership battle to Ramaphosa in 2017, in which she was widely believed to be a stalking horse for Zuma and his cronies.</p> <p>Dlamini-Zuma <a href=\"https://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2020-05-04-john-steenhuisen-shades-nkosazana-dlamini-zuma-over-cigarette-ban/\">champions the tobacco ban</a> (as health minister, she banned public smoking in 2001), and journalists and opposition parties have alleged she has connections to tobacco smugglers. Both Dlamini-Zuma and the alleged tobacco smugglers have denied any wrongdoing. Such claims notwithstanding, she represents the old-school vanguardism of the African National Congress leadership.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/commentisfree/2020/may/01/africas-heavy-handed-lockdown-policing-must-not-become-the-new-normal-coronavirus\">Africa's heavy-handed lockdown policing must not become the new normal | Karen Allen and Anton du Plessis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many in the party came to power in 1994 with Soviet-style ideas of state control, but were unable to put them into practice because of the globalisation of free-market economics, the negotiated settlement, and the kind of liberal multiparty democracy that fostered a vibrant civil society. The compromises that the movement\u2019s leaders have had to make have left, in many of them, a profound sense of disappointment, one borne out by the reality of South Africa today. It is the world\u2019s most unequal society, and \u2013 particularly given the expectations of 1994 \u2013 one of its most disaffected. And, to be fair to Cele, South Africa is not Sweden. Due first to apartheid and then to the corruption of the state, South Africans are not known for respecting the law.</p> <p>Into this reality sailed the Covid-19 pandemic. For Ramaphosa, and the reformers in the party, it has presented an opportunity to implement a more collaborative approach to government. But for Dlamini-Zuma and others, it offers an unprecedented opportunity to take control. Already, young South Africans feel alienated from the party\u2019s paternalistic leadership: in the 2018 general election, only 20% of eligible first-time voters even registered to vote.</p> <p>Ramaphosa himself has noted that there can be no business as usual in the post-Covid-19 world. What this means, exactly, remains to be seen: here, as everywhere. What is at stake now in South Africa is far more than a power struggle within the ruling party, now fought on the battleground of the pandemic. Rather, it is the nature of trust itself, at a time when this is most necessary. Without such trust, based on the mutual respect between citizens and their elected leaders, rather than a government\u2019s command of its subjects, South Africa\u2019s fragile contract will disintegrate.</p> <p>\u2022 Mark Gevisser\u2019s next book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-pink-line-9781788165143.html\">The Pink Line: The World\u2019s Queer Frontiers</a>, will be published in July.</p>",

For example, a photograph of Miss Piggy and Kermit will offer the audience the choice between \u201cnon-binary couple\u201d and \u201ca love supreme\u201d; an image of James Dean and Marlon Brando gives you the options \u201cSlave &amp; Master\u201d or \u201cHair &amp; Make Up\u201d.

  "<p>The Sussexes\u2019 noble experiment in living a quiet life, free from the glare of publicity attached to a royal title, continues. First they started a war with the British tabloids, fighting them over the misuse of private information in court while grandly declaring a new policy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/20/harry-and-meghan-uk-tabloids-duke-duchess-sussex-sun-daily-mail\">\u201czero engagement\u201d</a> with a number of outlets. Then they moved to Los Angeles, a paparazzi-free zone perfect for people trying to reclaim their privacy. Now they have reportedly cooperated with <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/prince-harry-meghan-markle-biography-set-august-release-1293170\">a </a><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/prince-harry-meghan-markle-biography-set-august-release-1293170\">tell-all biography</a> \u2013 Finding Freedom: Harry, Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Family \u2013 that is coming out in August.</p> <p>According to a press release, Finding Freedom dispels \u201cthe many rumours and misconceptions that plague the couple on both sides of the pond\u201d and was written with \u201cunique access\u201d and \u201cthe participation of those closest to the couple\u201d. It is unclear how involved Harry and Meghan were with the book, but the Mail on Sunday claims they sat for interviews with the writers, Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand (representatives for the couple <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/05/prince-harry-meghan-markle-finding-freedom-book-biography-1202924544/\">deny</a><a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/05/prince-harry-meghan-markle-finding-freedom-book-biography-1202924544/\"> this</a>).

Let\u2019s be clear: the racism and malice directed at Meghan by parts of the British media has been horrific. The pair have every right to try to take control of their narrative. But cooperating with a biography entitled Finding Freedom may not be the best way to do so. They had a row with their family and relocated; they didn\u2019t escape persecution from a war-torn country.</p> <p>Maybe before going full-steam ahead with their rebrand, our fearless freedom finders should take a bit of a breather, lie low and avoid baiting the media.

  "<p>Though it\u2019s too early to judge how successful different countries have been in managing this pandemic, it\u2019s hard to escape the view that the UK has failed in several respects. The government muddled its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/uk-covid-19-strategy-questions-unanswered-coronavirus-outbreak\">initial epidemic control strategy</a> and was slow to roll out testing and contact tracing. Shortages in PPE may have contributed to the tragic deaths of frontline health workers. And measures to shield the vulnerable in care and residential homes have been inadequate.</p> <p>These failings aren\u2019t just the result of recent decisions \u2013 in England they\u2019re also symptoms of structural weaknesses in the health system, many of which can be traced back to the 2012 Health and Social Care Act. In October 2011, nearly 400 public health experts signed <a href=\"https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fhealth%2Fnews%2F8804619%2FNearly-400-public-health-experts-warn-Lords-to-reject-NHS-reforms.html&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7Cd701e0825c964e3f901e08d7f01d4b34%7C569df091b01340e386eebd9cb9e25814%7C0%7C0%7C637241880941487960&amp;sdata=OR208V3VIzV%2Bh4886jS0%2FGtzmvZf2tmGs%2B1cyJl3ukA%3D&amp;reserved=0\">an open letter</a> asking members of the House of Lords to reject these reforms, the brainchild of the former health secretary Andrew Lansley, warning they would \u201cundermine the ability of the health system to respond effectively to communicable disease outbreaks and other public health emergencies\u201d.</p> <p>The reforms were so extensive that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/01/bbc-coverage-nhs-bill\">David Nicholson, the former chief executive of the NHS, described them as \u201cvisible from space</a>\u201d. They abolished primary care trusts (PCTs) and created new clinical commissioning groups (CCGs). The Health Protection Agency, whose functions included protecting the public from infectious disease epidemics, was replaced with Public Health England (PHE). Where the Health Protection Agency was closely linked to the NHS, PHE was closer to Whitehall and the government.</p> <p>This shift was significant. PHE has remained conspicuously quiet during the pandemic, and it has fallen to independent public health experts to point out the errors of the government\u2019s approach. Having worked for government, I know how difficult it is to promote rational and evidence-based public health policy. But this is why public health officials must be given the independence to speak for the public and their health, rather than for the interests of government and Whitehall.</p> <p>Behind the 2012 act was a deep commitment to promoting market competition and expanding the role of private companies in the health system. The Lansley reforms reshaped the NHS as a loose, fragmented collection of public and private enterprises that would compete for funding. We can\u2019t know yet for certain how these changes have affected our response to Covid-19, but there are signs that the public health experts who cautioned against the reforms in 2011 were correct.</p> <p>By pushing the NHS further away from being a coherent, unified and integrated system, the 2012 reforms produced disorganisation and instability. The drive towards commodifying healthcare and enforcing market competition has weakened the NHS by diverting funds to pay for the administrative costs of running a market in a sector that is particularly prone to <a href=\"https://www.lwbooks.co.uk/sites/default/files/s64_02leys.pdf\">market failures</a>. Logistical planning is far more difficult in a competitive system that is designed to respond to short-term market signals. That the government had to recently ban NHS trusts from <a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/coronavirus/government-bans-trusts-from-major-ppe-deals-to-stop-them-competing-for-scarce-equipment/7027554.article\">competing against each other</a> to procure ventilators and PPE, thus depleting the national supply, is an example of how illogical market forces are in the face of a pandemic.</p> <p>By increasing the role of the private sector, the government also shrank the public sector\u2019s share of the healthcare market. The number of NHS hospital beds <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/nhs-hospital-bed-numbers\">fell by 5%</a> between 2012 and 2019. Inevitably, the government has rented private hospital beds for Covid-19 patients <a href=\"https://chpi.org.uk/blog/who-benefits-from-the-nhss-bailout-of-private-hospitals/\">at great cost</a>. But it gives no indication that the public sector\u2019s share of healthcare won\u2019t continue to shrink. It has recently contracted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/hospitals-sound-alarm-over-privately-run-test-centre-in-surrey\">Deloitte to run Covid-19 testing centres</a> and <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/coronavirus-tests-contact-tracing-serco-g4s-private-firm-a9497371.html\">Serco to run its contact tracing programme</a>, indicating a blind commitment to profit-making businesses rather than to a public health system working in the public interest.</p> <p>The government has long argued that <a href=\"https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.lse.ac.uk%2Fpoliticsandpolicy%2Fnhs-spending-on-the-independent-sector%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7Ca2f3f7317ff040bb96d108d7f033919f%7C569df091b01340e386eebd9cb9e25814%7C0%7C1%7C637241976591528108&amp;sdata=wWwQISMxjVz07Ac0ifiVmVuWmyxkBAMaEIFjVndYQrs%3D&amp;reserved=0\">privatising</a> some areas of the public sector delivers greater efficiency. But an estimated <a href=\"https://chpi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CHPI-PluggingTheLeaks-Nov19-FINAL.pdf\">\u00a31.5bn</a> leaks out of the care home industry every year to private companies and financiers. Money lost on ruinous PFI contracts is similarly eye-watering. From 2010 to 2015, companies that ran PFI contracts to build and run NHS hospitals and other facilities made<a href=\"https://chpi.org.uk/papers/reports/pfi-profiting-from-infirmaries/\"> pre-tax profits of \u00a3831m</a>. Over the next five years, almost \u00a31bn of taxpayer funds (\u00a3973m) will go to PFI companies in the form of pre-tax profits \u2013 equivalent to 22% of the additional amount of money <a href=\"http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/news/political-news/government-long-term-plan-to-increase-primary-care-funding-by-45bn/20038047.article\">(\u00a34.5bn) that the government has pledged</a> to the NHS over this period.</p> <p>The belief that NHS organisations should be managed like businesses shifted power from health professionals to finance managers and accountants, and led to changes in management culture. Tensions within healthcare organisations have been a source of difficulty for managers and healthcare professionals alike. Recent cases of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/02/nhs-whistleblowing-protection-tribunal-junior-doctors\">clinicians being disciplined and punished</a> for raising questions about clinical safety have raised alarm bells. Were concerns about the lack of PPE treated similarly?</p> <p>The 2012 act was aimed at opening up opportunities for private finance to extract profits from the health and social care sector. But it was also driven by a sincere belief that market competition would improve productivity, efficiency and innovation in the NHS. Yet the health and social care workers and local government staff who have often risked their own lives on the frontline of this pandemic haven\u2019t been motivated by market forces, but by the values of professional duty, public service, solidarity and compassion. Almost overnight, Covid-19 overturned the orthodoxies of market competition that have hindered effective care.</p> <p>The coronavirus crisis has cast light on many aspects of society \u2013 including the way that we fund, organise and manage our health systems. Now, more than ever, the government must agree to a review of the Health and Social Care Act. We need new legislation that restores the NHS to a properly managed public service that works in the public interest, driven by cooperation, compassion and professional ethics.</p> <p>\u2022 David McCoy is a professor of global public health and director of the Centre for Public Health at Queen Mary University of London</p> <p><br></p>",

We face a \u00a3200m shortfall at the end of September and we need a rescue but we can\u2019t just go from bailout to bailout.</p> <p>\u201cWe need a complete reset and we need to look at the redistribution of revenues. Parachute payments are an evil that needs to be eradicated.</p> <p>\u201cWe have six clubs in the Championship receiving parachute payments which means on average they get \u00a340m per club; the other 18 get \u00a34.5m each. So they\u2019re then struggling to try to keep up. Lower down [in Leagues One and Two] solidarity money is welcome but becomes very small. I don\u2019t like to call it a bailout, I call it a restructuring and a rethinking, but it\u2019s overdue and it\u2019s necessary.\u201d</p> <p>Regarding wages, Parry said: \u201cSalary caps and cost control are absolutely essential and there is a lot of debate about that. We\u2019re not talking about reimposing the maximum wage. We would not be capping at an individual level, we would be capping the total amount that individual clubs could pay \u2013 we are talking about capping the budget.\u201d</p> <p>Parry said that resuming this season behind closed doors would be of limited economic value to EFL clubs. \u201cIt\u2019s finely balanced but probably almost neutral and for a lot of clubs it would cost to play,\u201d he said. \u201cThe main argument for a resumption would be for reasons of sporting integrity.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/20/efl-to-consider-keeping-transfer-window-open-to-help-struggling-clubs\">EFL to consider keeping transfer window open to help struggling clubs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He added that relegation from and promotion to the Premier League should take place in full. \u201cWe expect three Championship clubs to be promoted \u2013 the Premier League are aware of our position on that.

A spokesperson said: \u201cParachute payments give newly promoted clubs the confidence to invest in their squads to be competitive in the Premier League. They are also a vital mechanism to give relegated clubs financial support while adjusting to significantly lower revenues and having a higher cost base related to their playing squads.</p> <p>\u201cThe EFL Championship is a highly competitive league with attendances, viewing figures and revenues the envy of second-tier leagues around the world. We see no evidence that parachute payments distort performance at that level and are an essential part of this highly competitive environment.</p> <p>\u201cWe also provide solidarity payments to every other EFL Club, payments without parallel elsewhere in leagues around the world.\u201d</p>",

He claimed his family had owned land here for 30 years, arguing that he had cleared only a minimal area he needed to work, and requested one fine be annulled because he was unable to pay it.</p> <p>Souza did not respond to messages sent to his phone.</p> <p>But to understand how Jair Ferreira de Souza is able to claim ownership of land within a federally protected forest, we need to step back into the Amazon\u2019s chaotic and rapacious history of colonisation.</p> <h2>The landgrabbers</h2> <p>The military dictatorship that ruled Brazil until 1985 \u2013 often lauded by Bolsonaro - encouraged migration and built highways to force development into the Amazon region, but failed to impose a functioning property system. Instead, it <a href=\"http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0103-40142005000200005\">sold</a> off chunks of forest \u2013 then largely government owned \u2013 to private investors. It also handed out lots to migrants who had been encouraged to move there from the poorer north-east.</p> <p>Much of this land was sold on later, often in deals involving unscrupulous notaries in a range of scams that continue until today, aided by the remoteness and lawlessness of the Amazon region. Adding to the disorder, under Brazilian law, improving land you are on can strengthen an eventual ownership claim. And Amazon farmers often argue that previous governments had encouraged them to move to the region, only to plonk a reserve on top of them years later even if they actually squatted the land afterwards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba82f083a3b0566503f71683b39a6c156a8ed96b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba82f083a3b0566503f71683b39a6c156a8ed96b/0_0_4200_2800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cattle grazing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cattle grazing on a ranch inside the Jamanxim Forest protected reserve.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jo\u00e3o Laet/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAs long as it\u2019s confusing, as long it\u2019s undetermined who owns what, the guys with the lawyers, the guys with the guns and the influence always win,\u201d said Jeremy Campbell, an associate professor of anthropology at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island, who specialises in Amazon land conflicts.</p> <p>Landgrabbers \u2013 nicknamed <em>grileiros</em>, or crickets, after the tested ruse of leaving fake land titles in drawers full of the insects whose secretions turn them yellow and convincingly old-looking \u2013 proliferate in the Amazon.</p> <p>Having some sort of document is key to eventually legitimising stolen land. These days farmers register their own land online \u2013 as was done for de Souza \u2013 but often there is more than one claimant for the same area. In Par\u00e1, there are around three times as many land titles as there is land, state prosecutor Jane Souza said in an interview. In December, Bolsonaro signed a <a href=\"http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2019-2022/2019/Mpv/mpv910.htm\">measure</a> allowing <em>grileiros</em> to claim up to 2,500 hectares (6,177 acres) of land squatted before 2018 under certain conditions, such as no environmental fines or embargoes. This needs to be approved by Congress.</p> <p>The Jamanxim national forest reserve we were in was created in 2006 to slow rampant deforestation. Farms in the reserve were supposed to be repossessed by the government, but that never happened. Commercial agriculture is not permitted there but many local people have never accepted its reserve status.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1324a26647473e784d8d0a937a8a097cc9c44800\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1324a26647473e784d8d0a937a8a097cc9c44800/0_0_4200_2800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paulo de Tarso Moreira Oliveira\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mr. Paulo de Tarso Moreira Oliveira, Federal Prosecutor of Santar\u00e9m, Par\u00e1.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jo\u00e3o Laet/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paulo Moreira, a federal prosecutor in Par\u00e1, explained in an interview that protected areas like Jamanxim are attractive to speculators who buy illegally cleared land cheaply to sell on, or deforest it themselves, betting it will be regularised in the future and increase in value. \u201cCrime compensates \u2013 and that makes it attractive,\u201d Moreira said.</p> <p>We spoke to residents of Novo Progresso who clearly saw themselves as hard-working pioneers in a hostile wilderness. \u201cWood, gold prospecting and now cattle made this town,\u201d Jadir Rosa told us.

First, landgrabbers and loggers remove the most valuable trees, leaving some cover to make it harder for satellites to spot the damage. The remaining trees are then felled, left to dry and burned \u2013 hence the fires. Later grass is sown, and cattle put on the deforested land to consolidate possession.</p> <p>This is \u201cthe classic cycle we have seen in recent years\u201d, said Greenpeace Brazil\u2019s senior forest campaigner, Adriana Charoux.

A satellite image from 2005, when the reserve was created, found no deforestation in the embargoed areas. In 2017, Nasa satellites found fires around the same area.

  "<p>To exist at this moment is to navigate (or try to fend off) the flood of grief that threatens to submerge even our rare, buoyant moments.

We can\u2019t stop thinking about the tens of thousands of families facing hunger, bankruptcy and homelessness even as they struggle to endure the loss of someone they dearly loved.</p> <p>What\u2019s striking, if not surprising, is that this deluge of sorrow has run dry at the door to the Oval Office.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/04/donald-trump-america-weimar\">Under Trump, America has gone a bit late Weimar.

It\u2019s hardly a shock to learn that our president\u2019s expressions of care and compassion have occupied a total of less than five minutes, out of all that time.</p> <p>After all, a man who mocked a disabled journalist and boasted about grabbing women wasn\u2019t elected for the depths of his kindness and the purity of his moral conscience. And it seems unrealistically optimistic to have hoped that the extremity of this crisis should have inspired, in our leader, a deep and essential change of heart.</p> <p>Arguably, few politicians seek (and are elected to) office out of an excess of compassion. Even those who respond to catastrophe in more appropriately \u201chuman\u201d ways \u2013 George W Bush mourning the victims of 9/11, Obama tearing up at the site of the Sandy Hook school shooting \u2013 have been parochial in their sympathies; there was little ceremonial grieving for the innocent child-casualties of our bombing and drone strikes in the Middle East.</p> <p>And yet we can\u2019t help thinking how much less worried we would be if a humane, competent, well-informed adult was making the decisions that affect us all. Though we\u2019ve learned that Franklin Delano Roosevelt turned away refugees from Hitler\u2019s Europe, we can still imagine how comforting it was, for those who lived through the Great Depression, hearing his radio speeches: absorbing their message of reassurance and hope, his determination to comprehend and mitigate the sufferings of our nation.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s enraged, self-infatuated maunderings are the opposite of Roosevelt\u2019s calm resolve. Yet ultimately our president\u2019s failure of empathy is less disturbing than the ways in which it appears to resonate with his supporters. He and his allies have framed our response to the crisis in terms of partisan politics, to imply (incorrectly, as the polls suggest) that tough conservatives are eager to get back to work sooner than scaredy-cat, stay-at-home progressives.</p> <p>The flag-waving, gun-toting, defiantly unmasked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/03/michigan-gretchen-whitmer-lockdown-protest-racism\">protest</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/03/michigan-gretchen-whitmer-lockdown-protest-racism\">ers storming the capitol buildings in Michigan</a> and Wisconsin would seem to support that view. This, too, is a situation that could have been defused by a president who projected sympathy, who persuaded his listeners, as Roosevelt did, that the pain of those who have lost jobs and businesses is shared by us all. Instead we see Trump\u2019s efforts to stoke rage and bitterness because he suspects that it might help solidify his base.</p> <p>It may be that the deepening polarization in our country \u2013 the suspicion, grievance and rage that the president is spouting and encouraging \u2013 is less political than spiritual. These divides go deeper than how we vote; they express our core beliefs about our responsibility to those with whom we share this brief span on this damaged planet.

But it\u2019s never seemed so virulent as it does today, perhaps because it has never been so openly advocated \u2013 so blatantly demonstrated \u2013 by our president. It\u2019s hard to think of anything more corrupt or corrupting than to boast about one\u2019s success when (as I write this) more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/may/04/coronavirus-map-of-the-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">60,000 Americans have died of Covid-19</a>. It\u2019s hard to imagine anything more grotesque than using the pandemic as an excuse to further the ongoing campaign to separate families and exclude asylum seekers and other immigrants.</p> <p>What\u2019s most frightening to me is that the lack of empathy \u2013 the selfishness, the resentment, the hope that others will suffer even more than we are suffering \u2013 is itself a kind of virus: contagious, dangerous, possibly even lethal. I\u2019ve heard people say that the Wisconsin and Michigan protesters \u2013 shouting shoulder to shoulder, refusing to observe the simple rules of social distancing \u2013 won\u2019t learn how profoundly Trump has betrayed them until they themselves contract the virus that they have been encouraged to downplay. I\u2019ve even heard it said how unfair it is that our overweight, out-of-shape politicians \u2013 too vain to wear a mask, flouting scientific advice and the dictates of common sense \u2013 have proved immune to the disease that has felled so many decent, generous people.</p> <p>But such statements echo the absence of compassion that Trump, by tweet and by example, is encouraging us to feel. It\u2019s become another thing to resist. I don\u2019t want to wish that <em>anyone</em> will learn that particular hard lesson, in that particularly hard way: not the governors opening their states for business before it\u2019s safe, not the demonstrators on the state capitol steps, not our president. Despite my own anger, frustration and fear, I still can\u2019t bring myself to claim suffering as a success.</p>",

In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>\n    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>\n    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>\n    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.</p>\n    <p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far.

After months of lockdown, people might assume that any easing of the restrictions meant the risk of infection had gone away. If infections then picked up and further lockdown was ordered, it was \u201clikely to be seen as a serious failure of policy and trust in public health advice will be lost\u201d.</p> \n<p>The documents do not provide complete transparency about the Sage group\u2019s deliberations, however. The four-page paper from the Spi-B group on easing the lockdown includes more than a page of redacted material.</p> \n<p>Other papers reveal that the Covid-19 Genomics UK consortium, a group of geneticists charged with understanding the epidemic, swiftly identified 12 lineages of the virus in March, consistent with the virus being imported to the UK from Europe and \u201cmultiple locations around the world\u201d.</p> \n<p>A further Sage paper agreed that stopping or reducing public transport would have a \u201cminimal effect\u201d on slowing the spread of the virus. Concerns that a London lockdown would lead to people leaving the city and spreading the virus elsewhere were dismissed because infections were already present outside the capital.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>On the day of the nationwide lockdown, 23 March, Sage considered a raft of measures that might be needed to ensure people complied with strict social distancing and the stay-at-home policy. It raised the prospect of new legislation to enforce social distancing and warned that people who were \u201ccomplacent\u201d about the virus needed to feel an increased level of \u201cpersonal threat\u201d which could be achieved using \u201chard-hitting emotional messaging.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked about the redacted material, a government spokesperson said: \u201cThe only redactions relate to comments made by a SAGE sub-group on the early development of policy still under consideration or to remove contact details. Redactions were carried out by officials working for the Government Office for Science in consultation with the department developing the policy.\u201d</p> \n<p><br></p>",

href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-05-05/victorian-deputy-chief-health-officer-captain-cook-tweet-cleared/12215532\">the ABC</a>, the Victorian public sector commission found her tweet comparing the impact of Cook\u2019s arrival to Covid-19 not against the code for public servants in the state, but van Diemen has since deleted Twitter off her phone, and has been counselled on social media risks.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb0f9138f082496a14bd6d5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time

  "<p>The shutdown feels like a good opportunity to examine an age-old feminist question: when women put makeup on, can they ever truly be doing it for themselves?</p> <p>We will probably never have an answer. The pressure imposed on women to look good is such a part of our existence that we might never get rid of it \u2013 even \u201cdressing up for oneself\u201d can be traced back to self-hatred fueled by a beauty-obsessed culture.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/11/celebrities-happy-in-their-own-skin-dont-take-it-at-face-value\">Celebrities happy in their own skin? Don't take it at face value</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the shutdown means that we interact less with the outside world and the societal pressures that come with it. We asked women about their own relationship to their appearance right now. Are some wearing a full face of makeup every day? Wearing a bra? And who still dresses up, anyway? Here are their answers.</p> <h2><strong>Dina Gachman, Texas</strong></h2> <p>Before everything shut down in Austin, I would put on mascara and lipstick (Clinique Chunky Cherry) every day, even though I work from home as a writer. My southern belle mom always taught us to \u201cput on a little lipstick\u201d no matter what \u2013 advice I hated as a teen. Somewhere along the way, I figured she was right. I still put on mascara and lipstick in quarantine, even though I know it\u2019s ridiculous. It makes me feel human. It brings some normalcy to a very abnormal and scary time and It lifts my mood, even if I\u2019m just walking to the mailbox.</p> <h2><strong>Sarah Skiles, Los Angeles</strong></h2> <p>I grew a unibrow, named it Angelina: Conquerer of Space and Time. I wanted to see what it would look like since I\u2019ve done upkeep since I was 14. I was disappointed by the results, which in no way made me resemble Frida Kahlo. Sparse. Too many years of plucking.</p> <h2><strong>Sarah Wilson, Leeds</strong></h2> <p>I feel much happier with my natural appearance after a month in lockdown. I\u2019ve worn makeup pretty much every day since I was about 14, even though in recent years I\u2019ve cut down to just a bit of foundation and mascara. I believed I had an uneven and blotchy skin tone, but having now not worn a scrap of makeup for a month (probably the longest I\u2019ve gone without it in nine years) I actually like the way my skin looks. I feel like I\u2019m going to have the confidence to just stop wearing makeup once this is all over.</p> <h2><strong>Niamh Ronan, London</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve spent even more time scrutinising and hating my appearance in lockdown. I\u2019m still doing my makeup almost every day and trying to make myself look presentable because I can\u2019t be [bothered] to get upset by my reflection. I am still tinting my eyebrows, doing a full skincare routine, tonight I think I will fake tan. It is kind of depressing. I really wanted this to be the time where I\u2019d get slightly comfortable in my own skin, but actually I can\u2019t. Especially not now \u2013 it\u2019s too much work to unravel years of self-hatred during a crisis.</p> <h2>Ariadne Braso, Philadelphia</h2> <p>Since shutdown, I\u2019m not wearing whole parts of my wardrobe, getting haircuts or getting my hair colored.

Trans-femme people can get really stressed out about body hair, but I\u2019m fortunate to have very thin facial hair and body hair so I don\u2019t notice it too much.</p> <p>Now when I look in the mirror I feel more stripped down. It\u2019s not about confidence, it\u2019s much more about the way I see myself. I see myself as very colorful and vibrant and so that\u2019s why I dress up the way I do. Right now it feels like some of the functions through which I normally express myself are disabled. In the past i have thought of myself as pretty vain but now I realize it\u2019s not about being vain, it\u2019s about not getting to express myself, and feeling like parts of myself are stifled.</p> <h2><strong>Danielle Emina, London</strong></h2> <p>I honestly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to go back to wearing a bra after this?</p> <h2><strong>Frances Forbes-Carbines, London</strong></h2> <p>I am 30 and rather overweight. Favorite dresses no longer zip up the back, and as all the shops are closed I\u2019m having to order dresses online, without of course trying them on first. I\u2019m eating somewhat wantonly: takeaways, large portions of meat and veg too. My face is unusually spotty. A couple of massive subcutaneous beasts lurk on my cheeks of all places, never rising to the surface. I put expensive green highlighter on them to make them less apparent, but now it looks like I have marker pen on my face. I doll myself up daily, thinking I want to look nice to walk my little dog. My leg hair grows and I shave it occasionally so I can wear my dresses.</p> <p>All in all I am discontented with my appearance in lockdown. I find all body types beautiful but I feel heavy and like my excess weight is tiring me out. I post maudlinly on social media about my excess weight and receive no likes. The lack of face-to-face contact with friends makes me blue, as well as lack of opportunities to go on dates and have occasions to dress up for.</p> <h2><strong>Allison Alexy, Michigan</strong></h2> <p>I think all I\u2019ve learned is that lighting matters more than anything else? Oh wait, and also that my hair is so flat it looks drawn on with a pencil. Two lessons! Someone said that what we realize now is that the best part of going out to dinner with your friends is that you don\u2019t have to look at your own face for that whole time. And it\u2019s true \u2013 I have been recording my lectures and it is humbling, man. To watch myself on a video is the worst.</p> <h2><strong>Elisabeth Gampel, Munich</strong></h2> <p>Since the lockdown, I love to wear no makeup. It is the first time I feel beautiful without it. I also wear sneakers (I normally do not like them because it reminds me of my childhood in a poor, working-class family), and I do not miss business clothes. And I do not want to wear a bra again.</p> <h2><strong>Sara Sloves, New York</strong></h2> <p>I don\u2019t have the same morning routine anymore and I am mostly wearing sports clothes. When I do take a shower, if I know I\u2019m going to go running, I\u2019ll put on sunscreen and a little bit of makeup \u2013 mascara and a little bit of eyeshadow. It makes me feel more awake and I feel like it\u2019s nice for other people to see something nice. I am having a little fun with it \u2013 wearing mismatching or stripy tights or something a little festive when I run, because life is a bummer right now. We can\u2019t control it, so trying to control what you can control helps a little bit.</p> <h2><strong>Afia Chaudhury, London</strong></h2> <p>You\u2019d think quarantine would see to me not taking care of my appearance and elucidate that this dressing up is for others. But it\u2019s proved that I do it for <em>moi</em>. I love looking/feeling buff. And as a Muslim when you pray you\u2019re supposed to look your best, so may as well stunt to the heavens.</p> <p><em>Some names have been changed.</em></p>",
  "<p>Rare is the NFL draft that provokes second guessing about a kicker. But this year\u2019s edition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/24/nfl-virtual-draft-television-abc-espn\">was no ordinary draft</a> (see: 19, Covid.) And Justin Rohrwasser is no ordinary kicker.</p> <p>When the New England Patriots selected Rohrwasser in the fifth round to replace the legendary Stephen Gostkowski, it was a shock, especially as the 23-year-old hadn\u2019t been considered an exceptional talent in college. ESPN host Trey Wingo was even forced to admit on live TV that the Worldwide Leader in Sports had no highlights of Rohrwasser\u2019s career.</p> <p>And even if there had been any B-roll of a weather-beaten Rohrwasser blasting three-pointers against Rice or Western Kentucky, none of those images could eclipse the more striking one on his left forearm \u2013 of the Roman numeral III ringed in 13 stars. To the untrained eye, the tattoo would seem little more than a marker of youth. To the keener observer, it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/25/justin-rohrwasser-new-england-patriots-kicker-tattoo-three-percenters-nfl-draft\">the unmistakable brand of the Three Percenters</a> \u2013 a far-right paramilitary group that champions gun ownership and resists federal involvement in local matters. Formed in reaction to the 2008 election of Barack Obama, some members of the group took up arms and served as sentries for white supremacist protesters at the 2017 domestic terror attack in Charlottesville, that resulted in 28 injuries and one death.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/may/06/nick-bosa-donald-trump-san-francisco-49ers-nfl-draft\">If athletes like Nick Bosa support Trump they should at least be honest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rohrwasser, who can be clearly seen exercising his right to bare arms in official team photos, has played the na\u00eff. He told reporters that draft night was the first time he\u2019d heard about the significance of his tattoo, which he says he mistook for a US military symbol. He pledged to ink over it, then promised to laser it off entirely, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/28/justin-rohrwasser-tattoo-new-england-patriots-three-percenters\">all the while apologizing to friends and family</a> whom he\u2019d put in the \u201ccompromising position\u201d of having to defend the indefensible.</p> <p>Those attempts at damage control might have sailed through the uprights if he hadn\u2019t followed and \u201cliked\u201d so much far-right social media content. Or recommended books from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/feb/07/how-dangerous-is-jordan-b-peterson-the-rightwing-professor-who-hit-a-hornets-nest\">Jordan Peterson</a> and other radical traditionalists. Or previously bragged about tattooing himself with a sewing needle. Or completely ignored the much bigger tattoo just under his Three Percenters dog whistle that reads \u201cLiberty or Death\u201d. That\u2019s the cry that was last heard by the anti-government protesters who\u2019d sooner drive down to the local statehouse with their guns and exhaust in a policeman\u2019s face than let something as trifling as global pandemic deny them the right to a haircut and a mani-pedi. Michigan governor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/03/michigan-gretchen-whitmer-lockdown-protest-racism\">Gretchen Whitmer said the demonstrations</a> at her state capitol \u2013 which, among other things, featured armed militia men waving Dixie flags and nooses \u2013 brought back memories of \u201csome of the worst racism and awful parts of our history in this country.\u201d</p> <p>So profound is the remorse in Rohrwasser\u2019s heart that he apparently spent a portion of what should have been the happiest day of his life crying in his car, according to an anecdote his high-school coach <a href=\"https://boston.cbslocal.com/2020/05/04/patriots-kicker-justin-rohrwasser-broke-down-crying-tattoo-controversy/\">shared with the Boston Globe</a>. And, shoot, you had to feel for him. Pro football makes it so easy to summon the sympathy. When white players like Rohrwasser get whistled for their supremacist taunts, somehow, they\u2019re the ones who are forgiven. It was true when Carolina Panthers quarterback Kerry Collins used a racial epithet to refer to black and Hispanic teammates. (<a href=\"https://www.thebiglead.com/posts/kerry-collins-used-the-n-word-at-training-camp-while-drunk-with-carolina-teammates-in-1997-a-year-later-he-was-gone-to-new-orleans-01dxggp6jweh\">He blamed it on the alcohol</a>.) It was true when Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Riley Cooper was caught on tape threatening to jump a security barrier at a Kenny Chesney concert and <a href=\"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1723166-riley-cooper-caught-on-tape-saying-racial-slur-at-concert\">\u201cfight every nigger here.\u201d</a> (He blamed it on the alcohol, too.) And it was true when Richie Incognito <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/04/richie-incognito-leave-miami-what-next-dolphins\">bullied his teammate Jonathan Martin</a> \u2013 \u201ca half-nigger piece of shit,\u201d in Incognito\u2019s estimation \u2013 out of the NFL. While Incognito resumed a career to which he\u2019s felt very much entitled, Martin has spent the five years wrestling with his mental health. Collins, Cooper and Incognito all carried on their careers in the NFL, as will Rohrwasser. You could argue that everyone deserves a second chance. Protest about the racism inherent in the US though, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/24/colin-kaepernick-nfl-workout-teams-response-interest\">you may well find your football career is over</a>.

We get an ESPN box on Clemson wideout Tee Higgins that ends <a href=\"https://www.cincyjungle.com/2020/4/28/21238980/bengals-espn-tee-higgins-mother-clemson-tigers-football\">with a bullet point</a> about his mom fighting drug addiction for 16 years. We get another bullet in the box on Colorado receiver Laviska Shenault Jr about his mother surviving West Nile virus. We get yet another bullet in the box on Alabama cornerback Trevon Diggs about his father dying of heart failure. It\u2019s enough to make you wonder where the bullet point about all the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/25/nick-bosa-nfl-draft-san-francisco-49ers-colin-kaepernick\">racist and homophobic posts Nick Bosa had liked</a> (and subsequently deleted) before he was taken second overall in last year\u2019s draft.</p> <p>For a shop run by Jimmy Pitaro \u2013 the politically averse ESPN president who has promised, on more than a few occasions, to deliver content that sticks to sports \u2013 these digressions are quite far afield indeed. What\u2019s more, every year his network seems to come into the draft with an endless supply of these backstories. (Maybe someday one of the 12,000 draft analysts in ESPN\u2019s employ will find the courage to weigh in.) It\u2019s almost as if there is a stubborn social construct in America that makes it virtually impossible for black athletes to escape the traumatic beats in their humble beginnings. </p> <p>If ever there was a team owner in the league who might appreciate the irony at work here, it\u2019s the Patriots\u2019 Robert Kraft. Here, after all, is a man who not only works with Meek Mill and Jay-Z on criminal justice reform, but also gives liberally to Blue Lives causes, supports the troops and first responders<strong> </strong>and counts our law-and-order president among his closest friends. How does a guy like Kraft wind up drafting a guy like Rohrwasser? Easy. His team had a need, and his coach saw something. With a bit of laser removal and a few clutch kicks, likely, Rohrwasser will soon reduce the breathless stories about his rightward leanings to a \u201cWest Nile\u201d-sized poverty porn bullet. The most people will remember is that he was called out for his extremist affiliations, he wept. As long as Rohrwasser plays the victim, he can never lose.</p>",
  "<p>Workers at a New Jersey nursing home ravaged by coronavirus have described a culture of silence, gross inaction from management and a desperate lack of protective equipment that has put them and their families in harm\u2019s way and made it largely impossible to protect their patients from the outbreak.</p> <p>AristaCare at Cedar Oaks, a long term <a href=\"https://healthapps.state.nj.us/facilities/fsFacilityDetails.aspx?item=NJ61216\">230-bed</a> care facility, had seen 106 confirmed coronavirus cases and <a href=\"https://www.state.nj.us/health/healthfacilities/documents/LTC_Facilities_Outbreaks_List.pdf\">29 deaths reported</a> as of last week.

Some have contracted Covid-19, and all described insufficient, inadequate or irregular provision of personal protective equipment (PPE) as they interact directly with residents, endangering everyone involved.</p> <p>Amid the pandemic, AristaCare did limit visitation and mandated screenings at the door for anyone entering the facility. But inside, the situation devolved quickly, staff say. One worker watched as roommates<strong> </strong>infected one another and died from the virus, and alleged that management acted too late.

One of them said she was told it would make the residents feel bad.</p> <p>\u201cBottom line is, I know I contracted the virus there, at work,\u201d the woman said.</p> <p>Ramkaran had been performing mandatory temperature checks and asking questions of everyone coming in and out of the home before she started running a fever in late March and later tested positive for Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cI was the first case in my house, first one to get sick,\u201d Ramkaran said. \u201cAnd I passed it along to my family, which is not a good gift to give.\u201d</p> <p>AristaCare at Cedar Oaks did not return multiple requests for comment.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/long-term-care.html\">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> has released guidance for nursing homes and long-term care facilities recommending that available face masks be reserved for healthcare personnel, who should also be reminded not to come in if they\u2019re sick and educated about their facility\u2019s new policies.</p> <p>Workers at AristaCare, however, described flimsy, cheap masks they were originally provided as PPE. They said some people had come into work sick, and one nurse had even been given a hard time for reporting her symptoms, her colleague said.</p> <p>Ever-changing guidance from the CDC was posted around the facility, but staff were never privy to any real knowledge, beyond basic reviews of hand-washing practices, about protocols during the pandemic, some said.</p> <p>In the absence of leadership, workers chronicled a piecemeal game of telephone, where information about how to handle the outbreak<strong> </strong>came mostly from news outlets and each other.</p> <p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t prepare us for any of this. They didn\u2019t come and say, \u2018oh, you know, so-and-so is going on, and we all need to be prepared and be extra careful,\u2019\u201d said Ramkaran. \u201cThey didn\u2019t give us any kind of notice.\u201d</p> <p>As some workers call out tired, sick or afraid, others now have to shoulder an even heavier load in an industry already <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/most-nursing-homes-are-not-adequately-staffed-new-federal-data-says\">infamous for chronic understaffing</a>.

The caregivers are deemed essential, she said, but they\u2019re simultaneously not seen as the \u201cfull human being\u201d that they are.</p> <p>Ramkaran has been ill since 24 March, but AristaCare has only paid her 37 hours of sick leave, despite her being a 10-year veteran with the company. She feels certain she contracted the disease while at work, a possibility her human resources contact initially dismissed.</p> <p>\u201cWhen they told me I didn\u2019t get the virus at the job, I was really disappointed and hurt,\u201d Ramkaran said. Because she had taken on extra shifts, the only places she spent time before showing Covid symptoms were at AristaCare and home, she said.</p> <p>As Ramkaran\u2019s family members cared for her, they too got sick, and both her asthmatic daughter and husband with respiratory and heart problems have tested positive for Covid-19. Her husband required two hospital visits as his oxygen levels dropped.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait for this to be over,\u201d she said.</p>",
  "<p>Relaying accurate information, in the normal course of events, is vital. Scrutinising government, in the normal course of events, is also vital. But these are not normal times.

Meanwhile, anti-vaxxers are storming state capitols and infiltrating the lockdown protests.</p> <p>Science is fighting hard to be heard but the drumbeat of economic interests is drowning it out. The Guardian, however, will continue to give science a voice so that the US public can make informed decisions based on data, not dogma. Even as coronavirus cases rise across much of the country, the president has become the cheerleader-in-chief for reopening the states. Logic dictates we do otherwise but logic and reason are in short supply. And these decisions matter. It is critical that news organisations properly invigilate government policy and show how it shapes peoples\u2019 lives \u2013 and their deaths.

African Americans have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/coronavirus-racial-disparities-african-americans\">dying in record numbers</a> because they often live in polluted environments, have less access to healthcare and have more underlying conditions due to toxic stress.

When the Earth runs into that dust, we get meteor showers like the one we\u2019ll get tomorrow morning.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/03/starwatch-grains-from-halleys-comet-make-a-meteor-show\">Starwatch: grains from Halley's comet make a meteor show</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The particles may only be about the size of a grain of sand, but Brown says the speed they travel as they hit the Earth\u2019s atmosphere \u2013 about 60km per second \u2013 means they \u201cburn up quite spectacularly and produce a nice shooting star\u201d.</p> <p>Prof Jonti Horner, an astrophysicist at the University of Southern Queensland, was out last night in his back yard in Toowoomba, Queensland and saw about seven meteors in 30 minutes \u201cbut I probably missed a few as I was messing with my camera\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThey\u2019re a bit like buses \u2013 you might wait for a while and then you might see three in a minute.\u201d</p> <p>Horner says it takes the Earth about a month to go through the path of the dust trail, but early on Wednesday we will travel through the densest part. For the next few days people will still have a good chance to see meteors, he said.</p> <p>Horner says the best approach will be to get outside at about 4.15am and look roughly east and give your eyes about 15 minutes to adjust.</p> <p>He said it was best to lie down and look about 30 to 40 degrees above the horizon. The dust particles are burning up about 80km from the Earth\u2019s surface.</p> <p>Comet Halley is currently out around the orbit of Neptune and almost at its farthest distance away from the Earth before making a turn and heading back in our direction.</p> <p>Comet Halley comes by the Earth every 76 years and was last here in 1986 and won\u2019t be in our part of the solar system again until about 2061.</p> <p>But Horner said the dust from Halley hitting the Earth now is likely not from the comet\u2019s last venture here, but from a fly-by thousands of years ago.</p> <p>Each time it reaches the warmer climes of the solar system, Horner says Halley loses about one metre from its surface. The comet itself formed at the same time as the solar system, about 4,500m years ago.</p> <p>On Tuesday night, Horner captured a photograph of an Eta Aquarids meteor close to newly discovered Comet Swan.</p> <p>If the sky is very clear and you\u2019re away from town lights, then careful watchers may just be able to make out the blur of the comet \u2013 discovered on 11 April by Michael Mattiazzo, an amateur astronomer and member of the Astronomical Society of Victoria.</p> <p>Con Stoitsis, the director of the society\u2019s comet and meteor section, said his colleague Michael discovered the comet while studying images from an instrument aboard the <a href=\"https://soho.nascom.nasa.gov/about/about.html\">Soho satellite, launched</a> in 1995. Comet Swan is named after the instrument \u2013 the Solar Wind ANisotropies instrument \u2013 that took the image.</p> <p>\u201cI have seen the comet three times \u2013 it\u2019s a bit brighter than anticipated,\u201d said Stoitsis. \u201cNot many people in the world have seen it.\u201d</p> <p>He said people would be lucky to see Comet Swan with the naked eye, but it was in the same part of the sky that people would be looking at to see the meteors.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a good time to get out there and there\u2019s a window between about 5am and 5.30am when there\u2019s no moon. You might see 15 or 20 meteors an hour under really good conditions.\u201d</p> <p>In October, the earth will again pass through Halley\u2019s dust trail for a meteor shower called the Orionids which, Stoitsis said, did not tend to deliver as many meteors to the sky as the Eta Aquarids.</p>",

  "<p>Ida Ivowi\u2019s three younger brothers who live in Luton had all fallen ill from the coronavirus in April. She was in shock when one brother had died within hours of being admitted to hospital and tried to come up with a plan of telling her youngest, who has Down\u2019s syndrome, of the death. But just over a week later, he too would die from the virus.</p> \n<p>Ivowi, who lives in New York, first saw the coronavirus pandemic as a distant international news story. But within a few weeks, she watched from across the Atlantic as the deadly virus wreaked havoc on her loved ones.</p> \n<p>Olume Ivowi, 46, died on 10 April, Good Friday, in Luton and Dunstable University hospital within hours of being taken by an ambulance. Ida said she could not understand when she got the phone call that her brother died. \u201cIt was very difficult for any of us to wrap our heads around it. He went from being fine to now being dead,\u201d she said. \u201cWe then started the process of grieving.\u201d</p> \n<p>Olume left behind his devastated wife, Juanetta Ivowi, and their daughter, Mireille, three. Ida would spend the next 24 hours talking to her sister-in-law, while contemplating how to tell her younger brother, Isi Ivowi, 38, who lived in supported accommodation in Milton Keynes and was incredibly close to Olume.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe did not want to give him such news over the phone,\u201d Ida said, but as she figured out how to tell him the news, she got a call from his carers that Isi had fallen ill and had been hospitalised. She was getting regular updates from the hospital on her brother\u2019s prognosis, but the virus had taken its toll. Isi died on 19 April in Milton Keynes University hospital \u2013 just over a week after his older brother.</p> \n<p>The family believe the two brothers, who have underlying health conditions, may have contracted Covid-19 from one another as Olume was in constant contact with his younger brother. A third brother, Osi Ivowi, 50, from Milton Keynes, would be the only sibling to fall ill from the deadly virus and survive.</p> \n<p>The entire family has been hit particularly hard by the coronavirus pandemic, with two other extended members of the family also contracting the virus.</p> \n<p>Ida said her brothers have always been close with her and each other. They spend Christmas together and go on holidays throughout the year.</p> \n<p>She described Olume as a loving father who brought everybody together. \u201cHe was somebody who like to unify people.\u201d She said Isi was a caring person who loved music. \u201cWhen my brother went into hospital, he took in his radio because he likes music, and his phone so that we could get to speak to him.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"da6e7b30-c83b-43bf-8d5e-772e3e686b5a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/suTKhpuZPww?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>At times, Ida feels like she is in an alternative universe. She added that it was impossible to go through something like this without feeling fearful. \u201cSo now it\u2019s trying to get over that personal fear because you know what this virus is capable of doing.\u201d She called for people in both the UK and US to continue following the guidelines around the lockdown.</p> \n<p>Ida is, however, determined to celebrate the lives of her brothers and focus on moving forward together as a family. The family have already raised more than \u00a33,000 with <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/olume-and-isi-ivowi\">one GoFundMe appeal</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/h46q4-for-the-family-of-our-late-friend-olume-ivowi\">over \u00a38,000 in another</a>. \u201cIt was my birthday this week and we all met up online to remember our lost ones and support Olume\u2019s widow but we also think it\u2019s important to celebrate life in the now.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat has happened to us demonstrates how fragile life is and how we have to remember to appreciate each other and find the joy in every day because we never know what is around the corner.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Good evening and here is our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Josh Taylor bringing you the main stories on Tuesday 5 May.</p> \n<h2>Economy loses $4bn per week</h2> \n<p>In a speech to the National Press Club, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said that for every week the restrictions around Australia remain in place, Australia\u2019s economic activity reduces by $4bn.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/05/australian-restaurants-and-cafes-present-plans-to-come-out-of-coronavirus-shutdown\">Australian restaurants and cafes present plans to come out of coronavirus shutdown</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cWe must get people back into jobs and back into work. For every extra week the current restrictions remain in place, the Treasury estimates that we will see close to a $4bn reduction in economic activity from a combination of reduced workforce participation, productivity, and consumption.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is equivalent to what around four million Australians on the median wage would earn in a week. History shows that the longer people are unemployed, the harder it is to get a job. In the early 1990s, unemployment increased by 5% over three years, but took seven years to get back to its pre-crisis level.\u201d</p> \n<h2>ABS says one in three accommodation and food jobs gone</h2> \n<p>The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported one in three jobs in accommodation and food industries have evaporated since the coronavirus pandemic started.</p> \n<p>More than one million people have become unemployed since mid-March, meaning Australia\u2019s unemployment rate is now at around 12.5%.</p> \n<h2>A 16th resident at Newmarch dies</h2> \n<p>Anglicare reported that a staff member at Newmarch House, a western Sydney aged care home, who was working in the Covid-19 positive area of the facility, has tested positive for the virus.</p> \n<p>New South Wales reported two other cases of coronavirus at the facility on Tuesday.

Make a plan for tangible circumstances, like what you will do if you or someone you live with gets sick, if your business cannot reopen, if a natural disaster occurs while you\u2019re in lockdown \u2013 then put it aside and try not to worry about it.</p> <p>You can also shift your focus inward. \u201cImagine you\u2019re sitting with your grandkids in 50 years and they ask you, \u2018What was it like during the pandemic?\u2019\u201d says Eurich. \u201cAsk yourself, \u2018What are the things in my life I want to use this as an opportunity to get clearer on, and how can I reframe my situation with that longer lens to figure out what I should be focused on right now?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>If you find yourself worrying, Eurich suggests assessing your wellbeing in the moment \u2013 and appreciating what you do have. \u201cTo me, hope for the future can be replaced by hope for the present \u2013 gratitude,\u201d she says.</p>",

And that was from 79.2 overs; the pro-rata total was 462 in a day. England\u2019s captain Michael Vaughan later said that \u201cthe manner in which we played on that first day was the turning point of the entire series\u201d. You can probably see it now: Marcus Trescothick pinging a stream of the sweetest cover drives, Andrew Flintoff heaving sixes all over the gaff, Kevin Pietersen bringing up his 50 with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aQ1Bs_v4LI#t=2m45s\">the dreamiest cuff past mid-on off Brett Lee</a>.</p> <p>Even without Glenn McGrath, this was against a team with a 16-year aura and a four-man attack who had 1,083 Test wickets between them.

In the 10-day break after the first Test, the coach Duncan Fletcher drove up to do some technical work with Vaughan at the New Rover cricket club in Adel.</p> <p>When they chatted between net sessions they kept coming back to how submissive the batsmen had been, Pietersen aside, in the defeat at Lord\u2019s. They knew they had to tell the top six to be hyper-aggressive, however scary a prospect that might be, but Fletcher also stressed the need for \u201ctotal conviction\u201d in their delivery. They even discussed the tone of voice they would use.</p> <p>Although there was far more to Vaughan\u2019s captaincy genius, at its heart was a simple message: attack, except in times of trouble, when you should attack even harder, because it\u2019s by far your best chance of stealing momentum.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/03/my-favourite-game-middlesex-v-kent-2008-twenty20-final\">My favourite game: Middlesex v Kent, 2008 Twenty20 final</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We know all about McGrath\u2019s injury and the toss when Ricky Ponting made the errant decision to bowl first. \u201cHe didn\u2019t rate the English batting and it cost him and us,\u201d said Shane Warne in No Spin.</p> <p>The morning session went by in a blur of boundaries, and by lunch England were 132 for one after 27 overs. They got so far ahead of the game they were able to repel the inevitable Australia fightback and they also established an undeniable template for the rest of the series. \u201cMarcus\u2019s 90 was worth vastly more than many big hundreds,\u201d said Flintoff in his autobiography Second Innings. \u201cIt announced we had come to play.\u201d</p> <p>Even without McGrath, Australia had Warne to apply control and he was on inside the first hour. Yet even he went at a run a ball for most of the day. While he was defending Warne\u2019s first three deliveries, Strauss kept thinking back to Vaughan and Fletcher\u2019s team talk.

It was a completely sublime moment.\u201d</p> <p>England ran with the mood for the rest of the day, with Flintoff\u2019s exhilaratingly rustic 68, including five sixes, coming from only 62 balls. Like England, Flintoff had moments of fortune; he got off the mark with a mis-hit boundary off Warne that <em>just </em>cleared mid-off. Had that been caught, he would have had three runs in three innings in the series. Soon after he muscled Warne down the ground for six and then, in Warne\u2019s next over, chipped him over midwicket. He was aiming for four but timed it so well it went into the crowd. \u201cThat was when I thought: \u2018I\u2019m in here,\u2019\u201d he wrote in Second Innings. \u201cAnd things just started happening. It all came back.\u201d</p> <p>Flintoff said he \u201cbottled it\u201d in the first Test at Lord\u2019s.

The mission to test, track and trace those with coronavirus is part of the plan for new outbreaks of coronavirus to be suppressed, as the UK exits the lockdown.</p> \n<p>\u201cI am a bit concerned that a similar app in Singapore only had a 20% take up rate,\u201d Starmer told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to have more manual tracing as well.\u201d</p> \n<p>The government launched a pilot scheme on Monday to trial the app in the Isle of Wight, where people are being urged to download it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"82beeb58-e861-4575-90dd-2b879d1a3a65\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/uk-to-start-coronavirus-contact-tracing-again\">Contact tracing is one of the most basic planks of public health responses to a pandemic</a>&nbsp;like the coronavirus. It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>\n    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>\n    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>\n    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.</p>\n    <p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a>&nbsp;says it should be the \u201cbackbone of the response\u201d in every country.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\"><b>Sarah Boseley</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Hancock said the app was \u201ca very, very positive step in terms of us all being able to get some of our liberty back\u201d.</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cBy having the test, track and test in place we can release more of the social distancing measures and, as I said, the more people who download it ... the more effective it will be and the more we can control the spread of the virus, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to do this.\u201d</p> \n<p>The app has been criticised by some campaigners for jeopardising people\u2019s privacy. Amnesty International has raised concerns that \u201cthe government may be planning to route private data through a central database, opening the door to pervasive state surveillance and privacy infringement, with potentially discriminatory effects\u201d.</p> \n<p>However, Hancock dismissed that charge as \u201ccompletely wrong.\u201d Asked why, he said: \u201cFirstly because the data is stored on your phone until you need to get in contact with the NHS in order to get a test and secondly because the purposes of this are purely and simply to control the spread of the virus, which is really important.</p> \n<p>\u201cThirdly because we\u2019ve all had to give up significant infringements on our liberty, for instance with the social distancing measures and the lockdown, and we want to release those, and this approach will help us to release them ... I can reassure you that it\u2019s completely untrue.\u201d</p> \n<p>The health secretary was also questioned about whether new rules for social distancing and staying at home would be different for the over-70s and people with underlying health conditions.</p> \n<p>Many Tory MPs are urging the government not to treat people differently based on age, with Sir Graham Brady, leader of the backbench 1922 Committee, urging government to let older people take their own decisions about the risks.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-testing\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-testing&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus-testing</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Hancock would not give any assurances that older people would be treated in the same way as younger people when the lockdown is eased, although he said that had been the approach so far.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe [over-70s] are not part of the shielded group, which is about individual conditions.

  "<p>Four miles east of Paradise, California as the crow flies, fire chief Matt McKenzie awoke in confusion at 5am on Thursday, 8 November 2018. It sounded like rain hitting the metal roof of the fire station, but there was none in the forecast.</p> <p>It took him a moment to realize that it was pine needles being flung by a strange wind \u2013 not the usual intermittent gusts he was accustomed to hearing swoosh down the canyon, but a sustained, jet-engine roar. He got up and went to the station\u2019s small kitchen, where he put the coffee on and started dicing potatoes and onions for his crew\u2019s breakfast.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/book/index.html?opinion-tint=false&amp;is-extract=true&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Ff9b878fa06fdbec1cf96039acd01b5da77f4a6d7%3Fcrop%3D0_0_434_638&amp;title=Fire%20in%20Paradise%3A%20An%20American%20Tragedy&amp;author=Alastair%20Gee%20and%20Dani%20Anguiano&amp;publisher=WW%20Norton&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Ffireinparadisebook.com%2F\" data-alt=\"Book\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/book/index.html?opinion-tint=false&is-extract=true&image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Ff9b878fa06fdbec1cf96039acd01b5da77f4a6d7%3Fcrop%3D0_0_434_638&title=Fire%20in%20Paradise%3A%20An%20American%20Tragedy&author=Alastair%20Gee%20and%20Dani%20Anguiano&publisher=WW%20Norton&link=http%3A%2F%2Ffireinparadisebook.com%2F\">Book</a> </figure>  <p>A 20-year veteran of Cal Fire, California\u2019s state firefighting force, McKenzie had never rested easy at Jarbo Gap. Its location alone was enough to quicken the heart. The station was atop a high ridge overlooking the canyon in which a branch of the Feather River flowed southward, at about the point the canyon and the river make an abrupt, 90-degree turn to the east. Winds streaming down the canyon would run straight into this turn and spill out, moaning over the top of the station, especially at night, when canyon winds commonly pick up. Fires in the region often start in this steep and inaccessible declivity, served by a single main road that meanders alongside the water.</p> <p>At 6.15am, the electric company PG&amp;E experienced a power outage on a high-voltage line that traversed the canyon. Only one customer was affected \u2013 a hydroelectric station located in the canyon that was operated by a small city in the San Francisco Bay Area. At about 6.28am, a PG&amp;E supervisor driving through the canyon six miles north of Jarbo Gap saw a fire that he estimated to measure 100 sq ft in a clearing below the transmission line, and radioed a nearby company facility, which conveyed the alert to emergency services.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"153f88e6540a429d419f85684c454fcb3a267f3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/153f88e6540a429d419f85684c454fcb3a267f3e/0_159_4857_2914/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Power lines in Pulga, California, 8 November 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Power lines in Pulga on 8 November 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was the first warning of what would become the deadliest US wildfire in a century, claiming 85 lives and ravaging an entire town. Sparked in a region desiccated by drought, a few hours north of San Francisco, it would also be a harbinger of how the climate crisis is transforming the natural world.</p> <p>Before long, McKenzie\u2019s phone lit up with a text informing him of an ignition. He opened the back door to the kitchen and the wind ripped it right out of his hands. Although he expected to catch the smell of the fire, all he got was the dry pines. He and five other firefighters headed into the canyon in the dark in two trucks. It was a place McKenzie had known his entire life \u2013 as a kid growing up in the nearby town of Oroville, he would come up here with his dad to hunt, fish, or log a Christmas tree in the high, green solitude. It took them about fifteen minutes to reach the fire, going as fast as they could while keeping the engines on the road and avoiding nosediving into the canyon. As soon as they got there, McKenzie was dismayed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/05/we-created-the-anthropocene-and-the-anthropocene-is-biting-back\">We created the Anthropocene, and the Anthropocene is biting back</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The flames \u2013 sheltered and low to the ground, a dusky orange \u2013 were on the wrong side of the river. McKenzie had been hoping that they would be on the canyon\u2019s east side, where they would be accessible from the two-lane highway he was on. Instead they were west of the river, off a dirt track called Camp Creek Road. It was an impossible location. Camp Creek Road was hewn roughly into the side of the valley and in some places had been washed out by floods. It was so narrow that a fire truck could pull in its wing mirrors and still probably scrape the rock outcroppings. It could take another forty minutes just to carefully creep down to the blaze, and once they reached it there would be nowhere to turn around, meaning the truck would have to reverse out. That would be agonizingly difficult under any circumstances, but especially in the face of flames being wind-whipped toward them.</p> <p>It was a situation in which McKenzie would want to call in aircraft to drop water or retardant, but he knew that wasn\u2019t an option: it was too dark and the wind too savage. \u201cIt was so close to a highway yet so far away,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was taunting \u2013 you see it, look at it, and it\u2019s right there, and you can\u2019t do a frigging thing about it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It looked to Matt McKenzie like a fire with enormous potential, the kind of fire he might want to throw hundreds of fire engines at</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Camp Creek Road may have defied fire crews, but it did lend the blaze its incongruously playful name: the Camp fire. Analyzing from the highway, McKenzie thought the wind was behaving unusually. Typically it blows south, toward his station. This time it was blowing west, as if trying to push the fire up the wall of the river valley, in the direction of the small community of Concow and, beyond it, Paradise.<strong> </strong>This was why he had been unable to catch its smell earlier.</p> <p>It looked to him like a fire with enormous potential, the kind of fire he might want to throw hundreds of fire engines at. But there were only a fraction of that number in the county. He radioed the incident command team in Oroville, the county seat, and requested fifteen additional engines and four bulldozers. His hope was that they would catch the fire once it topped the slope it seemed to want to crest.</p> <h2>Escaping with dogs and a cat</h2> <p>The community of Concow centers on Concow Reservoir, which presents as an alpine lagoon fringed with tule reeds and piney mountains. The valley is a dimple in the gnarly uplands that separate Paradise and Jarbo Gap, and despite its relative proximity of only a couple miles to both, the circuitous roads mean that it takes 45 minutes to drive to the former and 25 minutes to the latter. People moved here to work the land and for the sun-speckled, dirt-road lifestyle. In the early 1970s, Concow\u2019s population of loggers, homesteaders, and retirees was supplemented by hippie types looking for a more sustainable kind of existence, inspired by the Whole Earth Catalog, Wendell Berry, and the back to the land movement.</p> <p>A former firefighter who lived in Concow named Scott Carlin had been doing his best to shut his mind off when he overheard a transmission from Jarbo Gap firefighters at the scene of the fire. Severe insomnia meant Carlin could go three or four days without sleeping, and that night, for the first time in years, he was forced to forgo his usual Ambien pill because he had been unable to fill his prescription. He lay oppressively awake on the living-room couch in a house west of the lake as his wife, Renee Carlin, a nurse at both an ER and a jail, and their two sons, Michael and Cody, dozed peacefully.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5171d44ca4694dda849fd368bdb2acaa16248095\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5171d44ca4694dda849fd368bdb2acaa16248095/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Concow reservoir.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Concow reservoir.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Renee Carlin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Carlin kept several of his old helmets on the wall, including the one he\u2019d worn on a callout 20 years before, which almost became his last. He had been searching a burning mobile home for its occupant when a fireball exploded through it; he hit the floor, inches below the boiling maelstrom, and only got out because a colleague was groping for him through the doorway. Now he was a stay-at-home dad taking care of the property and of Cody, a sweet boy who had autism and needed ferrying to special classes and therapists. But it was hard for Carlin to shake the fire bug, which explained the radio scanners tuned to emergency frequencies on a desk just over his shoulder.</p> <p>The message said the fire in Concow could be dangerous, but Carlin was cautious: was it really the case, or was the firefighter just green? When a second transmission confirmed the risk, Carlin roused his wife and sons, and they started throwing belongings in suitcases.<strong> </strong>Outside he tried to clear flammable brush away from the house with his little tractor, but it didn\u2019t have much effect. Another radio message said that a home nearby had caught fire, and Carlin ran five minutes down a dirt footpath through the ponderosas, to the lakeside home of his wife\u2019s parents, to tell them to get out. He jogged back to his own house, and then, for good measure, went back to his in-laws one more time to make sure they had left. Carlin joked that his mother-in-law, a retired teacher, did not operate on any schedule but her own. To his relief, they had gone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a41d6d21ba1305aca4a2a20f28d39a26347841ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a41d6d21ba1305aca4a2a20f28d39a26347841ae/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scott and Renee Carlin with their grandson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott and Renee Carlin with their grandson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Renee Carlin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the radio, Carlin heard that the main road out of the valley was blocked. Having planned to escape this way, he was forced to change his course. Immediately he thought of the one place he knew would be free of fire. Carrying their cases \u2013 with their cat in a cage and their two dogs on leashes \u2013 Renee and the kids hurried through the smoky woods, past her parents\u2019 house and toward the lakeshore. Cody had been afraid of dogs since a family pet had jumped on him and knocked him over when he was little. Renee told him he would just have to take one. Michael dashed to see if their aged neighbor, whom they only knew as Bruno, had left, and returned with Bruno\u2019s arm around his shoulder, half carrying, half dragging him down the hill.</p> <p>In no time at all they were engulfed. Flames were licking the edge of the lake, and the family edged out up to their knees in the muddy tule reeds. Bruno\u2019s foot got stuck and he fell on his back. Fragile at the best of times, he seemed to give up. <em>Just go</em>, he told Carlin. <em>Leave me alone</em>. When Carlin went to pull him up, Bruno refused to give him his arm. \u201cI\u2019m not doing that,\u201d Carlin said. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving you, I\u2019m not gonna burn, so you\u2019d better get your butt up.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ff42976ec5aeef89c911c7c6d8e943438ca782aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff42976ec5aeef89c911c7c6d8e943438ca782aa/0_0_5104_3401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flames from the Camp fire burn near a home atop a ridge near Big Bend, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flames from the Camp fire burn near a home atop a ridge near Big Bend, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unexpectedly, the reeds began to catch fire, and they had to edge deeper into the lake. Renee and her sons were quickly up to their necks or treading water. Cody had the cat in a cage on his shoulder, and the mewling animal was half-submerged. It was early November in the mountains, and the water was so painfully cold it took Renee\u2019s breath away. She thought her heart might stop. Carlin, still in the reeds with Bruno, couldn\u2019t see her in the smoke.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m not leaving you, I\u2019m not gonna burn, so you\u2019d better get your butt up</p> <footer> <cite>Scott Carlin</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Swim to the island, he shouted to them. By island he meant a peninsula sticking out from the opposite side, about 350ft away. Cody stayed behind, but she and Michael kicked out in the frigid water, and in the half-light, Renee could see the shore around her wreathed in smoke, and orange flashes of flame. The husky she was holding got loose and swam back to Scott. The border collie, panicking, tried to climb on top of her and threatened to push her under, and she screamed.</p> <p>Yet the wind was so strong that despite propelling themselves in one direction they were pushed in another, down-shore of where they had launched out. It was a lucky mishap \u2013 Michael found two rowboats, each with a paddle inside, tied with a cable to a stump. He tried to wrench the cable apart, but it wouldn\u2019t give, so he smashed the wooden post. Waterlogged and rotten, it splintered. Paddling themselves back to Carlin, they tried to coax Bruno aboard, but he flatly refused to get in. He simply couldn\u2019t do it, he said. So with one hand Michael steadied a boat, and with the other he lifted Bruno onto the craft. Under the weight of four people and the dogs the boats were only two or three inches above the water, and Carlin told them to go without him. He would find them later.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1eee84962029128e592fdd9265e7ce116d0d3086\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1eee84962029128e592fdd9265e7ce116d0d3086/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Firefighters work to contain the Camp fire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Firefighters work to contain the Camp fire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Dasilva/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They struck out, and this time they did end up on the peninsula. Soaking wet, they were freezing despite the occasional hot gust from across the lake, and they hid behind a rocky outcropping to try to keep out of the wind. Bruno\u2019s ability to make sense of the situation was going, and he seemed not to remember what was happening. Renee\u2019s legs were so cold that she couldn\u2019t walk. Michael went to find help, hollering in case someone could hear him. In the distance there was a response to his cry.</p> <h2>\u2018The fire is now in Paradise\u2019</h2> <p>On lots hidden by screens of trees across the valley, long-timers fired up their tractors or chainsaws and began clearing flammable brush from around their properties, to create a swathe of defensible space. Others jumped into their cars and poured out onto bad roads on which visibility was rapidly diminishing. They witnessed things that defied all logic and experience.</p> <p>Looking across the road to her neighbor\u2019s property, just a few hundred feet away, one woman, a British transplant named Joanna Curtin, saw a bulging whirlwind of flame and smoke that was sucking debris from the ground, setting it alight, and rocketing it into the sky. It was a fire tornado as wide as a pickup truck, and it was moving slowly but inexorably toward her.</p> <p>\u201cIt sounded like a freight train going around. It sounded \u2026 it had this other sound too, more evil,\u201d she said. \u201cOh God, I can\u2019t even imagine what I could describe it as close to,\u201d she added. \u201cThere was nothing earthly about it.\u201d It was spinning and \u201cthrowing big pieces of wood on fire,\u201d three to four feet in length.

  "<p>When Gladiator was released in early May 2000, there wasn\u2019t much of an inkling that it would go on to win the Oscar for best picture, for the obvious reason that it was positioned as the first of the summer blockbusters, promoted less for its historical gravitas than its bloody combat in a digitally enhanced Colosseum. In retrospect, it shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise that two and a half hours of speeches, montages and decadent pageantry would fit into a broadcast that\u2019s an hour longer and slightly less violent. But the best picture designation has been an odd stain on Gladiator\u2019s reputation over the years: a film that might have been remembered as a satisfying revenge spectacle instead looks like a second-rate prestige picture.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/21/the-virgin-suicides-at-20-sofia-coppolas-debut-continues-to-haunt\">The Virgin Suicides at 20: Sofia Coppola's debut continues to haunt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Twenty years later, perhaps it\u2019s time to take Gladiator back to its original framing, not as the spoiler to Steven Soderbergh\u2019s unlikely coronation as a Hollywood director \u2013 his Erin Brockovich and Traffic were best picture nominees, and he won best director for the latter \u2013 but as a classed-up underdog sports movie, like a middle-period Rocky sequel in sandals and tunics. The palace intrigue that follows the death of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius may give the film a certain amount of sophistication, as do the performances by Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix and Connie Nielsen, who all make excellent and multi-layered contributions. Yet this is essentially about an undersized warrior gutting his way to a title bout \u2013 all else seems like window-dressing by comparison.</p> <p>The competitive arc of Gladiator is Rocky III leading into Rocky IV. It\u2019s about our hero first belting his way through a colorful array of opponents \u2013 barrel-chested goons, armor-plated archers on chariots, man-eating tigers emerging from the arena floor \u2013 before finally battling the villain on hostile turf and turning the home crowd to his favor, against the will of a brutal authoritarian government. Again, this is not a mark against the film, because it\u2019s mostly rousing on these terms, boosted by a Roman succession plot that plays one man\u2019s epic revenge quest to the highest of stakes. But the argument that the film is any deeper than the red-meat savagery it delivers doesn\u2019t hold up under scrutiny. It\u2019s a terrific summer movie, and one of the new century\u2019s least deserving best picture winners.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b3bee6300b5452fb9c9995de0c53c1870bbca66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b3bee6300b5452fb9c9995de0c53c1870bbca66/0_0_2048_1479/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Djimon Hounsou and Russell Crowe at the Gladiator premiere\" width=\"1000\" height=\"722\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Djimon Hounsou and Russell Crowe at the Gladiator premiere.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fred Prouser/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For director Ridley Scott, it started a run of enervating historical action-dramas that included Kingdom of Heaven, Robin Hood and Exodus: Gods and Kings, none of which had the same propulsive kick. The benefit of Crowe\u2019s Oscar-winning lead performance \u2013 and a script (by David Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson) that was geared around it \u2013 is that he makes it impossible to get lost in the hectic atmosphere Scott conjures here from hundreds of extras, digital landscapes and assorted period bric-a-brac. There\u2019s a lot to draw the eye away from the central action in Scott\u2019s films \u2013 Orlando Bloom, for example, doesn\u2019t have the presence to draw focus in Kingdom of Heaven \u2013 but Crowe\u2019s General Maximus Decimus Meridius has a simple and well-defined mission, and the actor plays it as righteous as a sword plunged straight to the hilt.</p> <p>Contrasting the scorched earth of Germania, where Maximus leads his men in one final push against the barbarians (\u201cAt my signal, unleash hell!\u201d), with the golden fields of home, where his wife and son await after his years away, Gladiator begins with a patriot\u2019s humble request. In exchange for his service to the empire, he wants a little time off \u2013 those fields ain\u2019t gonna harvest themselves, you know? But he gets caught up in circumstances beyond his control: the dying Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) wants him as a placeholder to boost the senate and lead Rome toward democratic rule. But that means passing over his vile, sadistic failson, Commodus (Phoenix), who craves the unfettered power of an emperor and unnaturally shortens his father\u2019s life to get it. Commodus condemns Maximus to a quiet execution in the forest, orders his family murdered and sets about engineering the dissolution of the senate and a comprehensive quashing of dissent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c32f56fd4c6978a8a558a3bfc0102c756d5e77b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c32f56fd4c6978a8a558a3bfc0102c756d5e77b/0_0_2733_1748/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Connie Nielsen and Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator\" width=\"1000\" height=\"640\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Connie Nielsen and Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Dreamworks</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Maximus is picked up by slavers in Zucchabar, a Roman city that would now be in Algeria, and he\u2019s forced to battle to the death alongside other gladiators \u2013 first in local events and later in the Colosseum, where he becomes a sensation. The fun irony is that the feckless Commodus has brought the gladiators to Rome as a bread-and-circuses initiative to distract the great unwashed while he seizes total authority over the empire. Now with Maximus besting all comers in front of lusty boobirds turned super-fans, chanting his name like the Soviets rooting for Rocky, Commodus\u2019s hold on the throne is becoming more tenuous.</p> <p>Phoenix is a wonderfully hissable villain as Commodus, a legacy brat who understands his own absence of nobility and honor as liberating qualities \u2013 like any good tyrant, he sees a clean conscience as a terrible obstacle to his ambition. But most of the behind-the-scenes complexity comes courtesy of Nielsen as Lucilla, Commodus\u2019s sister and Maximus\u2019s former lover, who acts with political expediency in order to survive, but asserts herself firmly in the shadows. Lucilla is a glimpse into what Gladiator might have been if its priorities were directed more toward the machinations of government rather than the machinations of separating a man\u2019s limbs or head from the rest of his body.</p> <p>The action sequences in Gladiator dance right on the edge of coherence, which may have something to do with the difficulty of matching live-action with digital backdrops, but mostly falls in line with popular action directors like Michael Bay or Scott\u2019s brother, Tony, who were favoring movement and viscera over the nuts-and-bolts of clear blocking. When Maximus is battling an undefeated chest-thumping hulk twice his size named Tigris and actual tigers appear in support, it becomes obvious that we\u2019re being treated to a bread-and-circuses gorefest along with the Roman commoners. And once you come to that realization, Gladiator no longer seems like a bid for respectability. It had respectability imposed on it.</p>",

Beaumont is among the most solid and clubbable of rugby men and wants nothing less than the best for his sport. The problem is that \u201csteady as she goes\u201d is not the ideal mantra for the cliff edge upon which rugby teeters.</p> <p>Beaumont\u2019s piece of paper is also far from blank. No the Six Nations won\u2019t be budging from its February\u2011March slot, and no there won\u2019t be any big push for gate revenue sharing with poorer southern hemisphere nations. If it stays that way there is no real possibility of a brave new world, merely an extension of the fudging and back-scratching with which rugby remains associated. The clubs will be invited to stay in their box \u2013 or rebel \u2013 and international players will continue to be pulled between two demanding masters to ensure the show stays on the road.

In those days weekly long\u2011haul air travel was a given, player wellbeing was less of a priority and the term \u201ccarbon footprint\u201d was someone else\u2019s problem. Listening to some of the proposals suggesting England should go and play successive rat\u2011a\u2011tat Tests in Japan, South Africa and Argentina in October makes you wonder whether anyone has looked at an atlas lately. Even Bear Grylls would struggle with that itinerary and he doesn\u2019t have to do any scrummaging.</p> <p>No, rugby has to begin by remembering what makes it such a great sport. Its fixture planners need to stop jumping about like grasshoppers on acid and work out what really matters. Personally, the first piece in the jigsaw, apart from the World Cup, would be the British &amp; Irish Lions which offers pretty much everything to which the game should be aspiring: camaraderie, adventure, colour, romance, mass interest and rarity value. Lock it in on a four-yearly basis but with Asia and/or the Americas hosting it once every 16 years and proper preparation time guaranteed. Make it a tour, not a business trip, and the charm will be real and enduring.</p> <p>When should it happen? There is logic \u2013 as long as the club and European competitions are involved in the debate \u2013 in combining the existing July and November international windows between late September and early November when World Cup tournaments are already staged. Which means that, two years in every four, there is a chance to do something meaningful which, hopefully, makes some money.</p> <p>Let\u2019s call it the Lomu Shield: a big name for a big idea. Held biennially in either the northern or southern hemisphere, it would involve three pools of four \u2013 with seedings based on finishing positions from the previous spring\u2019s Six Nations and Rugby Championship \u2013 with the three pool winners and the best runner\u2011up advancing to the semi-finals and a grand final at a pre-arranged venue. The other eight sides would compete for places five to 12, with the bottom\u2011placed side playing off against the top emerging nation side from their own hemisphere (Japan, for the purposes of this argument, would be aligned with the south).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/03/rfu-failing-to-make-most-of-talented-youngsters-academy-rugby-union\">Lost youth: RFU face questions with up to 20% of academy talent at risk | Robert Kitson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not quite the proposed Nations League, then, and not quite a pale World Cup imitation, either. There would be an element of relegation jeopardy but the whole thing would be marketable in every region. Buy into it and the rest of the pieces start falling into shape. If the Six Nations were to happen in April and early May would that really be so terrible? Away supporters would still travel, it would be played in better weather on firmer surfaces and showcase the sport at its finest. It would also intersect with the Rugby Championship down south, with the latter reaching a climax a fortnight or so later. No point having too much of a good thing and clashing with the Six Nations finale.</p> <p>All of which means less disruption to the north\u2019s domestic competitions which, Six Nations aside, would be handed a clear run from mid\u2011November to July.</p> <p>A 24-team two\u2011division British &amp; Irish League, a revitalised European Champions Cup, a world club championship? Arguing over the precise details is less important than everyone pulling together for the common good and prioritising a clear, manageable structured season for the players.</p> <p>There would also be more room for women\u2019s rugby, the grassroots game and sevens. The women\u2019s Six Nations in September and October? Sevens as a summer sport? The current Championship and National League One reinvented as a heartland tournament that grips the national imagination?

In response, rangers in Bwindi are now required to wear face masks, use hand sanitiser and keep their distance from the apes.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/05/conservation-in-crisis-covid-19-coronavirus-ecotourism-collapse-threatens-communities-and-wildlife-aoe\">suspension of ecotourism</a> during the coronavirus pandemic has also meant the main source of revenue for gorilla conservation has been lost and there are fears some of those in surrounding communities who depend on tourists could turn to poaching out of desperation. \u201cWe are worried,\u201d says Bashir Hangi, a spokesman for the Uganda Wildlife Authority, the state body that manages Bwindi and nine other national parks. \u201cIf this continues, it\u2019s definitely going to reverse the achievements. There\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201d</p> <h2>Back from the brink</h2> <p>Ever since a young military officer named Oscar von Beringe discovered mountain gorillas (then promptly shot two of them) in 1902, these magnificent mammals have endured persecution. Disease, hunting and habitat destruction have blighted their two populations, split between Bwindi in Uganda and the Virunga range of extinct volcanoes that straddle DRC, Rwanda and Uganda. </p> <p>It was in 1979 that conservation groups first started collaborating to protect the dwindling population, founding the Mountain Gorilla Project to run tourism and education initiatives to change local attitudes. But gorilla numbers continued to drop, whether they were dying in traps intended for antelope, or being killed in retaliation for raiding crops. Grisly trinkets made from their hands and heads were sold in tourist markets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b68945e0eb5be603f311e02f4868d02c70ed730f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b68945e0eb5be603f311e02f4868d02c70ed730f/0_0_5282_3521/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mountain gorilla from the Mukiza family rests with an infant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mountain gorilla from the Mukiza family rests with an infant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Losh</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The legendary primatologist Dian Fossey began using uncompromising methods to pull these critically-endangered creatures back from the brink, from repelling herders by spray-painting cattle to directly confronting poachers, many of whom were impoverished locals with few options.</p> <p>In 1985, a few weeks before her 54th birthday, Fossey was murdered in Rwanda. Her killers were never found. Shortly before her murder, Fossey had said she feared there would be no mountain gorillas left within 15 years.</p> <p>But a census one year after her death revealed the opposite; numbers were increasing. \u201cThere was a glimmer of success,\u201d says Behm Masozera, the IGCP\u2019s director. \u201cIn order to sustain that success, a more cohesive programme was built around it.\u201d</p> <p>This resulted in the International Gorilla Conservation Programme (IGCP) \u2013 a coalition of nonprofits comprising Conservation International, Fauna &amp; Flora International and WWF that was more formalised than the Mountain Gorilla Project, with a remit across DRC, Rwanda and Uganda. This long-term alliance, argues one member, should be replicated elsewhere. \u201cThis is entirely the way we need to be working,\u201d says Cath Lawson, regional conservation manager for Africa at WWF-UK, \u201cto have that transformational change for wildlife like mountain gorillas to thrive.\u201d</p> <p>In 2003, despite DRC\u2019s protracted conflict and the earlier horrors of the Rwandan genocide, sustained efforts had increased Virunga\u2019s population to 380. An additional 320 in the cloud forests of Bwindi brought the total population to 700 individuals. The upward trajectory continued, propelled by 2015\u2019s intergovernmental treaty. Snares, fashioned from ropes or wires that cut deep into gorilla flesh, began to disappear.</p> <p>In November 2018, the subspecies was upgraded from critically endangered to endangered, having surpassed 1,000 individuals. By the end of 2019, the number of known mountain gorillas reached 1,063. But there is no room for complacency. \u201cYes, this demonstrates what we can achieve,\u201d says Lawson. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a done deal.\u201d</p> <p>Ecotourism has played a central role in this conservation triumph, alongside a scheme that splits the revenue with nearby communities, adapting earlier divisive models of \u201cfortress conservation\u201d into something more inclusive and equitable.</p> <p>Undeniably, though, coercive methods to protect wildlife have devastated traditional life for Batwa \u201cpygmies\u201d, a forest-dependent indigenous minority who were evicted in their thousands from Bwindi and other Ugandan parks as protection activities ramped up in the early 1990s and continue to suffer today.</p> <p>Yet other local communities hail the Bwindi project \u2013 and its pragmatic fusion of wealth creation with environmentalism \u2013 as a genuine gain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"983d69b0d52b6baa61885f28d04c9225af1d6e48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/983d69b0d52b6baa61885f28d04c9225af1d6e48/0_0_5344_3563/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tina Katushabe, left, sits with women supported by the Change A Life Bwindi charity as they weave colourful baskets.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tina Katushabe, left, sits with women supported by the Change A Life Bwindi charity as they weave colourful baskets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Losh</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.changealifebwindi.org/\">Change A Life Bwindi</a> charity trains former poachers in beekeeping, mothers in basket weaving, and teenage girls unable to afford school in tailoring.

She feared her 57-year-old mother\u2019s life could be at risk if she kept going to work at two different homes, but knew she would lose her income if she didn\u2019t.</p> <p>Fran\u00e7a rallied the sons and daughters of other maids to launch the campaign \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Pornossasmaes\">for the lives of our mothers\u201d</a>, with a manifesto calling for guaranteed protection for the health and jobs of the country\u2019s domestic workers during the pandemic.</p> <p>Their <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/ao-poder-p%C3%BAblico-empregadores-e-empregadoras-de-dom%C3%A9sticas-e-diaristas-e-toda-sociedade-civil-quarentena-remunerada-imediata-pra-domesticas-e-diaristas?recruiter=1056504459&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=share_petition\">petition </a>demanding that all of Brazil\u2019s maids \u2013 mainly poor, mostly black women \u2013 be granted immediate \u201cpaid quarantine\u201d has gathered more than 87,000 signatures and touched a nerve in a country where the working arrangements for maids are often seen as a legacy of slavery and reflection of deep inequality.</p> <p>The campaign comes amid a furious debate about class and privilege in Brazil after 63-year-old housekeeper <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-rio-idUSKBN21B1HT\">Cleonice Gon\u00e7alves</a> became the first person in Rio to die of coronavirus, which she is believed to have caught from her employer in the upmarket area of Leblon. Her employer had reportedly just returned from holiday in Italy but Gon\u00e7alves had no idea that she was ill and was not offered the chance to stay away.</p> <p>Since then domestic workers across the country have shared stories of employers arbitrarily dismissing them, or giving them orders such as, \u201cJust come at a different time so you can avoid rush hour\u201d, or refusing to stick to health guidelines. Some say their employers have demanded they move in to ensure they don\u2019t get infected elsewhere, even though this would mean leaving their own families.</p> <p>\u201cMy boss wouldn\u2019t let me go [stay off work] so I could stay at home and not get this disease.

A provisional <a href=\"http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2019-2022/2020/Mpv/mpv936.htm\">law </a>has been introduced allowing employers to reduce maids\u2019 hours and suspend their contracts for up to 60 days, with an emergency fund to cover loss of income.</p> <p>However, some employers insist that domestic workers keep providing the services they don\u2019t want to take care of themselves. The situation is especially precarious for the millions of domestic workers without formal papers, including more than 2 million <em>diaristas </em>(daily workers), whose average wage of 120 reais (\u00a317) a day may sustain their whole family.</p> <p>Brazil has more domestic workers than any any other country \u2013 over 7 million. Maids have steadily gained rights in recent years, and in 2018 the country ratified the International Labour Organization <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_616549/lang--en/index.htm\">convention on domestic workers</a>. But legal loopholes have left many working without the formal status that protects them.

They use public transport, are in regular contact with others \u2026 and don\u2019t have the option of working from home, especially daily maids.</p> <p>\u201cThey earn on average less than the minimum wage and only around 30% have a formal contract, leaving them more exposed to abuse and violation of their rights.\u201d</p> <p>Underpinning this vulnerability, says Fran\u00e7a, is racism. \u201cWe have a history of almost four centuries of slavery in this country. That means that in 2020, we live in a society that is structurally racist. You are going to say to me: \u2018But I didn\u2019t enslave anyone\u2019, but you benefit from the privileges inherited through this context of slavery. Just as our bodies \u2013 black and from the periphery \u2013 are affected daily by this racist society.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f85f41d68a32d2f29710c8f982de6070278a713b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f85f41d68a32d2f29710c8f982de6070278a713b/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thiago Firmino and other volunteers spray disinfectant in an alley to help contain the spread of coronavirus in the Santa Marta slum in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Friday, 10 April 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Volunteers in Rio\u2019s Santa Marta favela have been working to sanitise the streets.

There\u2019s another pertinent Ipsos Mori stat that perhaps explains that anxiety, though, and that comes from their weekly coronavirus trend poll: 66% of Britons now believe the <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/spike-britons-thinking-government-acted-too-late-address-coronavirus-confidence-nhs-continues-grow\">government acted too late</a> in enforcing stricter lockdown measures.

I\u2019m staring at Raab in the storm gutter again, still unblinking. It\u2019s not him either. Nor is it Johnson with the single balloon. Perhaps this is how the fear will manifest itself over the coming weeks and months, as a new social movement defined by mistrust: paranoid stay-indoorsers, waiting for a triple-lock all-clear from the World Health Organization before they venture onto a bus again. It could be months after the economy opens up before people dare to go properly outside again. I\u2019m not sure, after all this, government messaging alone is going to convince them.</p> <p>\u2022 Joel Golby is the author of Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant</p>",

The centre, which researches health inequalities, has identified at least three suspected coronavirus deaths in hostels since March, with a third of hostels reporting suspected coronavirus cases.</p> <p>There are an estimated <a href=\"https://www.crisis.org.uk/about-us/the-crisis-blog/the-numbers-game-understanding-the-true-scale-of-rough-sleeping/\">11,000</a> rough sleepers in England. More than <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/communities-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-2-may-2020--2\">5,400</a> rough sleepers known to councils have been offered accommodation since March but there are still more than <a href=\"https://www.homeless.org.uk/sites/default/files/site-attachments/Annual%20Review2018.pdf\">35,000</a> homeless people living in hostels across the UK. Forthcoming UCL modelling indicates that more than one-third of the hostel and street homeless population could get Covid-19 without intensive infection controls. This could lead to 4,000 hospital admissions and 364 deaths by August.</p> <p>\u201cHostels are as risky as care homes and prisons,\u201d says epidemiologist<strong> </strong>Andrew Hayward, director of UCL Collaborative Centre for Inclusion Health. \u201cThere are lots of people with chronic diseases sharing toilets, showers and communal spaces. They provide the perfect conditions for coronavirus outbreaks.\u201d</p> <p>Another patient at the hotel fell ill while living in a crowded hostel in Shepherd\u2019s Bush, west London. \u201cI tried to self-isolate in my room because I\u2019ve had pneumonia,\u201d says Luke Donnelly, 39. \u201cBut I had to run the gauntlet to get my dinner every day by queuing up at a hotplate with 30 or 40 people. There were also probably about six or seven residents on my landing using the same toilet. It was a recipe for disaster.\u201d</p> <p>Still, London has managed to avoid the far larger and deadly outbreaks seen in US cities, such as <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Health/27-york-city-homeless-hundreds-cases-died-covid/story?id=70139748\">New York</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/15/san-francisco-homeless-coronavirus-msc-shelter\">San Francisco</a>. Testing by UCL\u2019s outreach team suggests only 3-5% of rough sleepers in London are now carrying the virus. \u201cThere\u2019s a very low rate of asymptomatic carriage in our homeless population, particularly when you compare it to the American numbers,\u201d says Story. So far, the three UCLH outreach teams have tested nearly 500 rough sleepers, of whom 29 had the virus. From this week, they will be ramping up their testing capacity to over 100 people a day. One of the teams is led by John Gibbons, a former heroin user and hostel resident. Gibbons has referrals coming in constantly. \u201cWe go and immediately test any suspected cases.

But when I got to the hotel, the nurses were like friends, family and carers. They were brilliant.\u201d</p> <p>Yet provision outside the capital appears to be patchy. Other UK cities with high number of rough sleepers such as Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle do not have equivalent medically run isolation facilities for homeless people and few appear to be carrying out targeted testing. Instead, rough sleepers with Covid-19 symptoms are having to self-isolate as best they can in homeless hostels or in hotels. </p> <p>The lack of a nationwide Covid care network makes Hayward nervous about future waves of the virus. UCL\u2019s modelling estimates that a second wave could lead to 22,000 homeless people getting the virus. \u201cI\u2019m really concerned we could see further outbreaks in hostels throughout the UK when the lockdown is eased and the transmission starts to pick up again in the wider community.\u201d </p> <p>A Ministry of Housing spokesman says: \u201cOver 90% of rough sleepers known to councils at the beginning of this crisis have now been made offers of safe accommodation \u2013 ensuring some of the most vulnerable in society are protected from the pandemic.\u201d</p> <p>Back in the hotel, Story is watching six convalescing Covid-19 patients reading donated books on the other side of the hotel car park. He wants every part of the country to fully prepare for a potential re-emergence of the virus in the homeless population \u2013 as well as thinking about how to permanently house the people currently accommodated in empty hotels. \u201cWe\u2019ve managed to prevent massive outbreaks among rough sleepers by quickly isolating and treating those with Covid-19. But if we kick everybody back into an environment that is completely unsafe, then we are asking for trouble,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are the dry tinder waiting for a spark.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>While thousands of us have been turning to local mutual aid groups during the pandemic, Lauren Henshaw went one step further.</p> <p>After asking members of her local Facebook group for Cheadle Hulme in Stockport whether there was a Covid-19 support group in the area, Henshaw \u2013 an operations director, who lives with her partner, Dave, and two-year-old daughter Beatrice \u2013 was surprised to find the answer was a resounding no. \u201cAnother woman and I realised nothing seemed to exist, so we discussed setting one up ourselves,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8524960470c343902e467902f67065371531132d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8524960470c343902e467902f67065371531132d/0_0_1504_1879/800.jpg\" alt=\"baby donations copy\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donations are taken to a local car park for Henshaw to collect</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Within days, Henshaw and fellow resident Roshni Latham had launched the Helping Hands Cheadle Hulme Facebook group, with the aim of sharing advice and matching people in need with volunteers or goods. \u201cWe bought pay-as-you-go phones and a local printing shop made leaflets which \u2013 with the postman\u2019s help \u2013 we delivered to vulnerable people, targeting those in sheltered accommodation and the elderly,\u201d she says. \u201cAt first, it was a volunteer-led service where people called us and Roshni and I would do things like shop for those who were isolating, pick up prescriptions and walk dogs. Then we started putting shoutouts on the Facebook group to match those in need with people who could help.\u201d</p> <p>In recent weeks, the group\u2019s focus has shifted to include not just older people and high-risk individuals, but others in need of help too. \u201cNow, most of that demographic have received letters from the government, local medical practices are involved in their care and food is more readily available,\u201d she says. So, the idea of a \u201cfamily bank\u201d was born, designed to support those who wouldn\u2019t necessarily ask for help. \u201cSo many people are falling through the gaps \u2013 you have to be registered to receive vouchers from the food bank for example, but many people aren\u2019t yet. Then there are people like hairdressers who lost income overnight. We wanted to help people like that, and be a useful resource to the community.\u201d</p> <p>The family bank works via Facebook requests, with Henshaw and Latham asking members to donate things such as children\u2019s toys or nappies, which are then taken to a local car park for Henshaw to collect. Adhering to strict social distancing guidelines, it\u2019s a major undertaking. \u201cI travel alone, take antibacterial wipes and wear gloves and everybody leaves items in the centre of the car park, and when I drop donations off, I knock on the door and wave from the car at a distance,\u201d she says. Her now-deserted office at a local industrial estate has become a temporary storage space for donations. It isn\u2019t without its difficulties, though. \u201cThe sheer scale of donations is huge and social distancing means it\u2019s just me alone. I haven\u2019t had time to sift through it all \u2013 I\u2019d like to organise it by age and gender so I can quickly grab what\u2019s needed.\u201d</p> <p>Henshaw and Latham have also enlisted the help of local businesses. \u201cWe\u2019ve run Q&amp;A sessions with a local HR consultancy for people confused about employment rights or being furloughed. A local accountancy firm has offered free webinars for small business owners, and a nearby golf club has donated soup, which I distribute through local community groups to care homes, hospitals and vulnerable people.\u201d Restaurants have also offered to cook meals, delivered by volunteers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0664100ba8b16598058ad62770a9ec861da47311\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0664100ba8b16598058ad62770a9ec861da47311/0_159_2016_1209/1000.jpg\" alt=\"washing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The group has been inundated with donations, such as children\u2019s clothes, from the local community</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Day-to-day, the pair have little time to stop and think about how far they\u2019ve come. \u201cSometimes I feel totally overwhelmed \u2013 as admins of the Facebook group, Roshni and I are constantly monitoring requests or messages and manning volunteer phones,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re also liaising with people offering services, handing out leaflets, dropping off goods and applying for council grants.\u201d And when daughter Beatrice takes her lunchtime nap, Henshaw takes the opportunity to drop off more donations, with plans already underway to set up a fundraiser to pay for a storage container, cleaning products and ingredients for meals. \u201cI\u2019m not getting much sleep,\u201d she admits. \u201cBut then you take a bag of clothes to a family in need and realise why you\u2019re doing it.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018All of us will need support one day; why not help now?\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"919e5586df63c910ca4ce2aef336077835491b9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/919e5586df63c910ca4ce2aef336077835491b9b/0_0_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"-Jesse Tan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jesse Tan of the Friend In Need Community Centre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shot remotely by P\u00e5l Hansen/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jesse Tan has always provided a lifeline for older people and, alongside a bevy of colleagues and volunteers, she is determined that during the lockdown those same people don\u2019t become isolated.</p> <p>Tan is the office manager of the Friend In Need (FIN) Community Centre in East Barnet, London, and is one of the many people around the country working on the frontline of community care during the Covid-19 crisis. \u201cI live everyday knowing that our jobs are making a very significant difference to the people who are now locked down, desperate at home,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Usually a busy day at the centre would involve welcoming visitors for anything from yoga classes, to tai chi or lunch clubs. \u201cOur main reason for doing that is to battle loneliness, it\u2019s a lot of prevention work because people come to build friendships and to socialise.\u201d</p> <p>But the day after the nationwide lockdown was announced, on 23 March, that all changed. With all of their usual activities put on hold, Tan and her colleagues had to swiftly mobilise to provide support for their clients, who are on average aged between 85 and 90.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d38d57c17bc7c9cfcc255fa9472039eee362366d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d38d57c17bc7c9cfcc255fa9472039eee362366d/416_0_2564_1960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"FIN Community Centre members and volunteers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"764\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">FIN Community Centre members and volunteers (taken before lockdown)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They created both a Covid-19 community response group, to help with shopping, prescriptions and small DIY jobs, and a specialised mental health fitness team, to provide a check-in service over the phone. \u201cSome had no one to collect their prescriptions or no food, or they had minor damages to their homes that made them worried or anxious,\u201d she says. \u201cOur calls have been very welcome as they were getting into a state of desperation, which \u2013 if not attended to \u2013 might trigger more severe problems.\u201d</p> <p>Thankfully FIN has been inundated with offers of help from local people. \u201cWe have been recruiting volunteers who are placed in contact with an older person to make sure they are looked after.

They each carry out one or two small tasks a week, but together the team has made a very significant difference to the services we can provide. I always tell them: \u2018Every little helps.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It is not always easy to provide support though. With their usual schedule cancelled, Tan says that FIN is without a lot of its usual funding: \u201cWe normally collect a nominal charity fee from the people who attend our services, but we have lost all that. We have been left with a very small amount of funding. We are at risk of closing down in two months as the money that we\u2019ve been saving has all been invested into the services we provide,\u201d she says. \u201cIf people can\u2019t give their time, it would be helpful if they consider donating.\u201d</p> <p>But for those who can give their time, there really is no time like the present, with an estimated 8.8 million people over 70 who have been advised to remain at home.</p> <p>Tan says: \u201cI always tell the younger people I work with: \u2018All of us will grow old. One day most of us will need some support. Would you help the people who are old and vulnerable and who need us today? They contributed to this country. They need us now.\u2019\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018The wellbeing of our community is our top priority\u2019</h2> <p>With the football season shut down indefinitely, a team in Scotland, Stenhousemuir FC, turned their energy to the community. Within days of the lockdown being announced a hotline was set up to help local people, and a 30-strong squad of volunteers assembled in the first week to carry out tasks, such as dog walking and shopping, for those in isolation. Since then the number of volunteers has hit 80.</p> <p>The idea has been well received, so much so organisers have branched out to ease the strain on parents by collecting school lunches from a local high school and distributing them to children stuck indoors. On just one day last month, volunteers delivered more than 130 meals.</p> <p>Stenhousemuir FC chairman Iain McMenemy, who helped to organise the initiative, says: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that there will be a significant impact on football and we will<br> no doubt be affected by this. However, there are more important matters. The coronavirus will affect thousands within our communities. The wellbeing of friends, neighbours and our community should be our top priority.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

  "<p>I stepped out of Oxford Circus tube<strong> </strong>into mid-morning crowds and cold, bright sunshine. The consultant\u2019s words were still ringing in my ears. \u201cNothing.\u201d How could the answer be nothing? This was January 2018, six months since my third miscarriage, a symptomless, rather businesslike affair, diagnosed at an early scan. The previous November, I\u2019d undergone a series of investigations into possible reasons why I\u2019d lost this baby and the two before it.</p> <p>That morning, we had gone to discuss the results at the specialist NHS clinic we\u2019d been referred to after officially joining the one in 100 couples who lose three or more pregnancies. I had barely removed my coat before the doctor started rattling off the things I had tested negative for: antiphospholipid antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, Factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation.</p> <p>\u201cI know it doesn\u2019t feel like it, but this <em>is</em> good news,\u201d he said, while the hopeful part of me crumpled. We were not going to get a magic wand, a cure, a different-coloured pill to try next time.</p> <p>Now, my husband, Dan, was back at work and, for reasons I can\u2019t really explain, I had decided to take myself shopping rather than go home after the appointment. I stood staring down the flat, grey frontages of Topshop and NikeTown and willed my feet to unstick themselves from the pavement.</p> <p>I ended up wandering the beauty hall of one of London\u2019s more famous department stores. I let myself be persuaded to try a new facial, which uses \u201cmedical-grade lasers\u201d to evaporate pollution and dead skin cells from pores to \u201crejuvenate\u201d and \u201ctransform\u201d your complexion. Upstairs in the treatment room, the form I was handed asked if I\u2019d had any surgery in the past year. I wrote in tight, cramped letters that six months ago I had an operation to remove the remains of a pregnancy, under general anaesthetic. When I handed the clipboard back to the beautician, she didn\u2019t mention it. I wished that she would.</p> <p>As I lay back and felt the hot ping of the laser dotting across my forehead, I thought how ridiculous this all was; that this laser-facial is something humans have figured out how to do. How has someone, somewhere, in a lab or the boardroom of a cosmetics conglomerate, conceived of this \u2013 a solution to a problem that barely exists \u2013 and yet no one can tell me why I can\u2019t carry a baby?</p> <p>There is no doctor who can reverse a miscarriage. Generally, according to medical literature, once one starts, it cannot be prevented. When I read these words for the first time, three years ago, after Googling \u201cbleeding in early pregnancy\u201d, a few days before what should have been our 12-week scan, I felt cheated. Cheated, because when you\u2019re pregnant you are bombarded with instructions that are supposed to prevent this very thing. No soft cheese for you. No drinking, either. Don\u2019t smoke, limit your caffeine intake, no cleaning out the cat\u2019s litter tray. I had assumed, naively, that this meant we knew how to prevent miscarriage these days, that we understood why it happened and what caused it; that it could be avoided if you followed the rules.</p> <p>You learn very quickly that the truth is more complicated. After a miscarriage, no medic asks you how much coffee you drank or if you accidentally ate any under-cooked meat. Instead you find that miscarriage is judged to be largely unavoidable. An estimated one in five pregnancies ends in miscarriage, with the majority occurring before the 12-week mark. Seventy-one per cent of people who lose a pregnancy aren\u2019t given a reason, <a href=\"https://www.tommys.org/our-organisation/about-us/charity-news/tell-me-why-tommys-campaign\" title=\"\">according to</a> a 2019 survey by the baby charity Tommy\u2019s. You are told \u2013 repeatedly \u2013 that it\u2019s \u201cjust bad luck\u201d, \u201cjust one of those things\u201d, \u201cjust nature\u2019s way\u201d.</p> <p><em>Just, just, just</em>. A fatalistic shrug of a word. But this is not the whole story. \u201cThere is this myth out there that every miscarriage that occurs is because there\u2019s some profound problem with the pregnancy, that there\u2019s nothing that can be done,\u201d says Arri Coomarasamy, a professor of gynaecology and reproductive medicine, and director of the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://bwc.nhs.uk/tommys\" title=\"\">National Centre for Miscarriage Research</a>, which was set up by Tommy\u2019s in 2016. \u201cScience is trying to unpick that myth.\u201d</p> <p>Unfortunately, the roots of this myth run deep. It\u2019s an idea reinforced by the social convention that you shouldn\u2019t reveal a pregnancy until after 12 weeks, once the highest risk of miscarriage has passed. It goes unchallenged thanks to age-old squeamishness and shame around women\u2019s bodies, and our collective ineloquence on matters of grief. The bloody, untimely end of a pregnancy sits at the centre of a perfect Venn diagram of things that make us uncomfortable: sex, death and periods.</p> <p>An impression persists that, while unfortunate, miscarriages are soon forgotten once another baby arrives \u2013 that you\u2019ll get there eventually. It\u2019s true that the majority of people who have a miscarriage will go on to have a successful pregnancy when they next conceive (about 80%, one <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/20649205_Influence_of_past_reproductive_performance_on_risk_of_spontaneous_abortion%20/\" title=\"\">study</a> carried out in the 1980s found). Even among couples who have had three miscarriages in a row, for more than half, the next pregnancy will be successful. Accordingly, the prevailing logic seems to be that not only is miscarriage something that cannot be fixed \u2013 it doesn\u2019t <em>need</em> to be fixed. There is little research or funding for trials, and only glancing attention from the healthcare system. What is not being heard, in all this, is that miscarriage matters.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>There is a magical feeling that comes on after a miscarriage, I have found. A semi-delusional state that lasts for days, sometimes weeks, afterwards. After each one of mine (and there have been four now), I\u2019ve caught myself believing I am still pregnant, despite all evidence to the contrary \u2013 the trips to A&amp;E, the blood, the still ultrasounds, the forms labelled \u201csensitive disposal of pregnancy remains\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dae44c5c3b838b7de94eecdb30dcf50e37bec05e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dae44c5c3b838b7de94eecdb30dcf50e37bec05e/0_0_733_1773/413.png\" alt=\"bubbles spot illustration\" width=\"413\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It starts in the mornings. For a moment, stuck somewhere between sleeping and waking, I won\u2019t have remembered, and, briefly, I\u2019m still happy. Pregnant. When the phone rings, for a split second I\u2019ll imagine it is the hospital calling to tell me there has been a mistake. A mix-up. They\u2019ve got the results: I am, in fact, still pregnant. Or my husband will say, casually, over dinner, \u201cOh do you want to hear some good news?\u201d and I\u2019ll think: he\u2019s going to tell me I\u2019m pregnant.</p> <p>It is the shock, I remind myself, the trauma: it leads to disbelief. Like feeling that the loved one who has died is about to walk through the front door any minute and sit in their favourite chair. This inability to accept reality seems logical to me \u2013 inevitable, even \u2013 when there is no explanation for what has happened. The brain wants to solve problems, to make meaning.</p> <p>There are very few specialist miscarriage clinics in the UK. Some people end up being seen by a general gynaecologist or sent to a fertility clinic. Generally, doctors will only agree to look for a possible cause of miscarriages once you have had three in a row. Even after investigations, which in NHS centres tend to look for structural problems with the womb and for blood-clotting disorders, around half of people will <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4229790/\" title=\"\">never be given a reason</a> for their losses. There aren\u2019t even official guidelines on preventing miscarriage \u2013 only on its diagnosis and \u201cmanagement\u201d.</p> <p>With no answers to your questions \u2013 why did it happen? Will it happen again? \u2013 you are cut adrift in a sea of recommendations from women on Mumsnet, private doctors, people offering fertility supplements, herbalists and nutritionists, and from cult best-sellers that promise to tell you how to improve the quality of your eggs. It\u2019s been more than 40 years since embryologist Jean Purdy watched as a single-cell embryo in a petri dish divided into two, then four, then eight cells that would become the world\u2019s first IVF baby. Humans have worked out how to intervene in order to create life in a lab, but not how to sustain it in the earliest weeks inside the body. The stage between conception and an ongoing pregnancy, visible on an ultrasound scan (at around six weeks) is sometimes referred to as the \u201cblack box\u201d of human development.</p> <p>According to Prof Nick Macklon, medical director of the London Women\u2019s Clinic and an expert in miscarriage and early pregnancy, the reason there\u2019s been so little progress is that we\u2019ve been asking the wrong questions. \u201cWe use the term \u2018recurrent miscarriage\u2019 as if it were a medical diagnosis, yet there isn\u2019t one single medical cause,\u201d he said. Some women may have a blood-clotting disorder; for others, a contributing factor could be thyroid dysfunction. Many women who miscarry appear not to have an underlying health condition at all; instead, their bodies seem to be less able to discern what is and isn\u2019t a viable embryo. Yet studies of possible preventative treatments tend to recruit their subjects as if all recurrent miscarriages have the same cause.</p> <p>This, in Macklon\u2019s view, is likely to explain why several large, quality trials of possible treatments to reduce the chance of miscarriage, such as heparin (a blood thinner) and aspirin, as well as the hormone progesterone, have failed to show any clear benefit, and have subsequently been dismissed by the medical community. Some of these treatments may in fact work for some women, but, Macklon says, \u201cbecause of the way the study is designed, it comes out as not working overall\u201d.</p> <p>A related problem lies in the mistaken assumption that most (if not all) miscarriages happen because the pregnancy was doomed to fail. In half of all miscarriages, the embryo will have a serious chromosomal abnormality that means it could never survive, but the other half are believed to be healthy embryos. Prof Siobhan Quenby, a consultant obstetrician at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire, heads up a specialist clinic into recurrent miscarriage, one of four centres that form Tommy\u2019s National Centre for Miscarriage Research. The key question, she believes, is establishing whether someone is repeatedly losing chromosomally normal or abnormal pregnancies. \u201cEveryone from their third miscarriage onwards should have their miscarriage tissue tested genetically,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Yet access to genetic testing is patchy. Not all NHS hospitals can do this kind of testing on site. If someone miscarries at home, the onus is on them to collect a clean sample of the tissue and take it to their hospital within 24 hours. This may not be something they can do \u2013 or even know about.</p> <p>Quenby is a celebrity in the world of recurrent miscarriage patients. Her name often crops up in the \u201cmiracle baby\u201d stories that make the papers, with headlines <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-48615134\" title=\"\">such as</a> \u201cBaby joy for couple who lost 13 babies to miscarriages\u201d. Her particular area of interest is how the lining of the womb behaves in early pregnancy \u2013 and how it might contribute to miscarriage. She is one of the authors of <a href=\"https://warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/recurrent_miscarriage_diabetes/\" title=\"\">a study</a> published in January 2020, which found that a repurposed diabetes drug, sitagliptin, could reduce the risk of miscarriage by boosting the number of stem cells in the womb lining. These cells are responsible for renewing the lining and reducing inflammation. \u201cIt\u2019s still only a small pilot trial, but it is fantastically exciting,\u201d Quenby told me. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time in a long time that there\u2019s been a potential new drug treatment.\u201d</p> <p>Quenby is convinced it\u2019s not so much the treatment options that are lacking, but the will to try them. \u201cIt\u2019s the opposite of \u2018we can\u2019t do anything\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are tons of things we can try now.\u201d Still, as a miscarriage patient, you run up against the dilemma that recurrent miscarriage is not a diagnosis in itself, so the difficulty is in establishing which treatment is most appropriate to you. Even with the help of the most motivated of doctors, there is going to be a degree of trial and error.</p> <p>Many people will be told, as we were, that the best treatment is no treatment \u2013 simply try again. This is what we did, only to miscarry for a fourth time. We were under the supervision of the recurrent-miscarriage clinic, yet even after that fourth loss, the prescription remained the same: just keep trying.</p> <p>It took us a year before we felt ready to roll the dice again. Shortly after I started researching this piece, in November, I found out I was pregnant for the fifth time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"6f77c21ea9fcb1f564070526a2eab1c98a81b93d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f77c21ea9fcb1f564070526a2eab1c98a81b93d/0_0_5884_3510/1000.jpg\" alt=\"illustration of pregnant woman and male partner with scene around them falling apart\" width=\"1000\" height=\"597\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>To be pregnant again after previous miscarriages is to live at the fork of two alternative lives. You try to think as little as possible about what\u2019s going on inside your body, while, of course, thinking about it all the time. Alive or dead? Baby or miscarriage? In every possible scenario, you plan for the two outcomes. To a certain extent, you are forced to buy into both possibilities simultaneously. You cannot truly believe it will work out, but you have to proceed as though you are pregnant anyway, until a scan proves otherwise. Alive <em>and</em> dead. Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s foetus.</p> <p>You treat yourself as your own walking research study: a sample of one. Perhaps you take a different brand of prenatal vitamin. Or you do different exercise. You do no exercise at all. You drink less caffeine. You drink no caffeine at all. You are more careful. You are <em>less</em> careful, because you\u2019ve been unimpeachably careful before and look where it got you. Mostly, though, you just wait.</p> <p>Why hasn\u2019t miscarriage medicine moved faster or farther? Why isn\u2019t there more certainty about what works and what doesn\u2019t? The first <a href=\"http://www.sites.hps.cam.ac.uk/visibleembryos/s2.html\" title=\"\">detailed depictions</a> of a human embryo\u2019s development, from three weeks to four months, were produced by the German anatomist Samuel Thomas Soemmerring in 1799, and the images are remarkably similar to graphics used in week-by-week pregnancy apps today. Yet a precise <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3987368/\" title=\"\">schema of measurements</a> to date the stages of early pregnancy \u2013 between seven and 16 weeks \u2013 wasn\u2019t established in modern clinical practice until 1973, with the advent of ultrasound imaging. We had put a man on the moon before we could routinely see, in real time, what was happening inside a woman\u2019s womb.</p> <p>Pregnancy research, in general, is underfunded. A recent <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/randeurope/research/projects/uk-pregnancy-research-needs.html\" title=\"\">research review</a>, published in January 2020, found that for every \u00a31 spent on pregnancy care in the NHS, less than 1p is spent on pregnancy research. \u201cCompared to other areas \u2013 such as infertility \u2013 miscarriage has certainly lagged behind,\u201d said Arri Coomarasamy, who sees patients in both fields.</p> <p>\u201cMiscarriage gets a bad deal,\u201d agreed Hassan Shehata, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, who runs the Centre for Reproductive Immunology and Pregnancy, in Epsom, Surrey. \u201cFor a start, there is no specialist training,\u201d he said. When you train as a gynaecologist, you can specialise in sub-fields such as infertility and IVF, but there is no specific speciality in miscarriage, he explained.</p> <p>There are also practical difficulties to conducting studies. \u201cPregnancy is difficult to research as, by its nature, studying it might disrupt it,\u201d Nick Macklon told me. This means you\u2019re often left with retrospective population data (easily skewed by multiple factors), or studying donated embryo or foetal tissue (tightly restricted for ethical reasons \u2013 and prohibited altogether by \u201cpersonhood\u201d laws in <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/state-mandated-mourning-for-aborted-fetuses/482688/\" title=\"\">some parts of the US</a>, which insist on burial or cremation of all pregnancy tissue).</p> <p>Even when human trials of treatments are feasible, there is the challenge of persuading women who are desperate to avoid another miscarriage to sign up to a study in which they might be given the placebo. As Ippokratis Sarris, a consultant in reproductive medicine and director of King\u2019s Fertility, a private fertility clinic in London, put it: \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to do a proper trial \u2013 people want to take something they think might work. How do you tell them they can\u2019t have it until there is good evidence?\u201d</p> <p>Now that I was pregnant again, there was one treatment I was desperate to try. Progesterone has long been the great hope of miscarriage research. This \u201cpro-gestation\u201d hormone is produced in higher quantities during pregnancy by a woman\u2019s ovaries (and, later on, by the placenta). It is essential throughout pregnancy and helps prepare the womb lining, although scientists don\u2019t yet understand the precise mechanisms by which it does this. In May 2019, a large, multi-centre trial of progesterone, given in early pregnancy \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.tommys.org/our-organisation/about-us/charity-news/prism-trial-bleeding-early-pregnancy-and-miscarriage\" title=\"\">Prism trial</a> \u2013 found that for women with a history of recurrent miscarriage who had started bleeding during their next pregnancy, taking progesterone made a significant difference to the live birth rate, compared with a placebo.</p> <p>I was prepared to argue the toss for progesterone with my doctors this time around. I knew the new evidence didn\u2019t perfectly fit our circumstances. I wasn\u2019t bleeding in this pregnancy, for one thing. To my surprise, the female doctor we saw at the clinic for our first appointment, in the first month of this pregnancy, agreed to prescribe it without so much as a raised eyebrow. It was not the first time I have asked about some speculative treatment, but it was the first time the clinic had agreed.</p> <p>As Dan and I joined the queue at the hospital pharmacy, tucked away in a grimy building in Paddington, I felt I was holding on to something bigger than the printed prescription in my hand. For the first time, we had something, after being told that there was nothing.</p> <p>Then less than a week later, at eight weeks pregnant, I started to bleed.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>There are therapies for miscarriage that have been available privately for well over a decade, yet are no closer to becoming mainstream medicine or available on the NHS. Where questions remain over the evidence, private clinics can go ahead and offer treatment anyway \u2013 something the NHS cannot do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fcc91ee5bf45687b88855b33b87d5444e2b16943\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcc91ee5bf45687b88855b33b87d5444e2b16943/0_0_669_1982/338.png\" alt=\"bubbles spot illustration\" width=\"338\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>One therapy available at a handful of private clinics \u2013 lymphocyte immunisation therapy (LIT), in which a woman is given a transfusion of white blood cells from their male partner before she becomes pregnant \u2013 has been banned in the US, outside of a research setting. Such treatments belong to a field known as reproductive immunology, and stem from work in the 80s and 90s by an American obstetrician, Alan Beer, who once summed up his theory in the following way: \u201cEffectively, women become serial killers of their own babies.\u201d</p> <p>The idea is that miscarriage can be caused by a hyper-vigilant immune system that misrecognises the symptoms of pregnancy as a threat. In these cases, treatment may involve suppressing the immune system using steroids or intralipids (essentially an emulsion of soybean oil and egg yolk, given intravenously, sometimes referred to as the \u201cmayonnaise\u201d or \u201cegg-yolk\u201d drip). Clinics charge up to \u00a350,000 for such treatments. However, all but one of the experts I spoke to expressed scepticism about their effectiveness.</p> <p>Funding high-quality trials is particularly difficult when it comes to treatments that target the immune system, because, according to Quenby, in the past there has been a tendency to over-hype the results.</p> <p>Quenby believes our understanding of miscarriage would improve if we considered it as a public health issue, as we do stillbirth and neonatal deaths. Both of these are more common where there are high levels of social deprivation, and it\u2019s likely the same is true of miscarriage rates, too. Though, currently, hospital trusts are not required to report the rate in their area.</p> <p>But like periods, female pain, the menopause and conditions such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/endometriosis\" title=\"\">endometriosis</a>, which also want for good research and understanding, it\u2019s hard not to conclude that miscarriage suffers from a lack of knowledge and interest because it happens to female bodies. What\u2019s more, the underlying assumption tends to be that miscarriage is always down to something a woman\u2019s body is or isn\u2019t doing.</p> <p>In 2019, researchers at Imperial College London <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/189690/recurrent-miscarriage-linked-faulty-sperm/\" title=\"\">found that</a> partners of women who have had three or more miscarriages tend to have higher levels of damage to their sperm\u2019s DNA. The trial was small, comparing the sperm of 50 men whose partners had had miscarriages with 60 men whose partners had not. The results will need to be replicated. And before any possible treatments can be trialled, researchers need to establish what causes such DNA damage.</p> <p>Still, Quenby said, \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re even looking at it is really important.\u201d Traditionally, men and their contribution to the pregnancy have been largely left out of the picture. In the past three years, while I have been scanned and probed and pricked for multiple phials of blood, aside from completing a form outlining his basic medical history when we were referred to the recurrent-miscarriage clinic, Dan has not been required to so much as cough and say \u201cah\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>When I discovered I was bleeding, I did a desperate search online for answers. I decided I was either having my fifth miscarriage \u2013 or, just possibly, the intermittent, brownish spotting was a side effect of the progesterone. I knew I should phone the recurrent miscarriage clinic, or my GP, or try to get an appointment for a scan at my nearest early pregnancy unit. But I couldn\u2019t bear to. I was not ready to talk practicalities just yet, and there was no one at the clinic to call for the sake of talking. Besides, we were due to go back for a scan the following week.</p> <p>In the following days, the bleeding didn\u2019t stop, but it didn\u2019t get worse, either. Even so, I couldn\u2019t shake the thought that, at eight weeks pregnant, this was the exact same point I had miscarried the last three times. Dan and I made our contingencies. It was early December, and we were due to move house in a few days, and we discussed how we would fit surgery around the move, if it turned out to be bad news. I bought sanitary pads and wine. We pretended we were sanguine. We pretended we knew how we would cope. \u201cWe\u2019re pros now,\u201d we joked. I barely slept the night before the appointment.</p> <p>On 4 December, my mum came with us to the hospital and managed to keep up a steady patter about her cycling, her knitting and the roadworks on the A14 while we waited. I knew she wanted to distract me. But the only words my brain had space for were the ones I was convinced I was about to hear for a fifth time: I\u2019m so sorry there is no heartbeat. I\u2019m so sorry there is no heartbeat.</p> <p>When we were finally called in for the scan, I explained to the sonographer that I was anxious. That I\u2019d been bleeding. I tried not to look at the print on the wall of the room \u2013 the same room we were in last time \u2013 of a red heart, printed in swirly faux-brushstrokes. I tried not to think what I thought last time: how fucking inappropriate that is. A heart, for when there is no heartbeat.</p> <p>I lay down on the bed and unbuttoned my jeans. Dan held my hand. I was braced for the words: <em>So sorry. So sorry.</em> Except they didn\u2019t come. The sonographer was telling us that everything looked fine. She turned the screen towards us, and she was pointing out the flickering heartbeat. She was telling us that I was measuring in at nine weeks and one day. The baby was<em> </em>moving. And I was crying.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Did I dare to believe that the progesterone was actually working? The possibility loomed in my mind that our miscarriages really had been \u201cjust\u201d bad luck all along. At least one of our losses was down to a chromosomal abnormality known as a triploidy: essentially an extra set of chromosomes. One cause of this is an egg being fertilised by two sperm at once \u2013 as random and unavoidable as that.</p> <p>About two weeks after it started, the bleeding waned and our clinic suggested it was time we transferred to our local hospital for antenatal care and the 12-week dating scan. (This is normally the first scan people have on the NHS, at the end of the first trimester, and it\u2019s used to check the foetus\u2019s health and estimate the due date.) On the one hand, this felt like an achievement \u2013 we had never made it this far before \u2013 but on the other, it meant leaving the relative security of the specialist clinic, where everyone understands why you don\u2019t want to think further ahead than the next appointment.</p> <p>Feeling like fledglings pushed from the nest, we had to brave the official NHS booking-in appointment, which involved giving our medical histories to the local midwifery team and some routine screening tests. We have done this twice before, during previous pregnancies, when we knew and worried less. Two days after the second one, I bled out the tiny embryo on our bed at home. I hadn\u2019t dared make this particular appointment since.</p> <p>We got our all-important appointment for the dating scan, a little over two weeks away \u2013 delayed slightly by the Christmas break. Time passed twitchily. We congratulated ourselves for not miscarrying on Christmas Eve, on Christmas Day, on Boxing Day.</p> <p>On 30 December, six hours before the scan, I read a note from the hospital that said you have to pay \u00a35 for a copy of the scan photo. Fleetingly, I debated getting some cash out, but decided this would be jinxing things. At the hospital, I squeaked my name to the receptionist. We were early. This may have been our 12-week scan, but it had taken us 48 weeks of pregnancy to get here. I really wasn\u2019t sure if I could wait another 20 minutes.</p> <p>I had my spiel prepared for the sonographer \u2013 \u201ca bit anxious\u201d \u2026 \u201cfour miscarriages\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThank you for telling me,\u201d she said, as I lay down. There was the briefest of pauses. \u201cOK, here\u2019s your baby.\u201d</p> <p>Whereas in previous pregnancies there had only been cavernous blackness on the ultrasound monitor, now there was wobbling movement; the grey outline of a head and a tiny, round tummy \u2013 a waving, wondrous sea creature emerging from the dark.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re a wriggler,\u201d the sonographer told us, smiling. I gripped Dan\u2019s hand and we watched as the baby \u2013 I will try to call it a baby from now on \u2013 somersaulted for us. For the first time, we left an antenatal unit with a scan photo and stepped out into entirely new territory.</p> <p>On 14 March, we hit 24 weeks, which is deemed the point of \u201cviability\u201d \u2013 that is, when a foetus is theoretically capable of surviving outside the womb. Whatever was going to happen to us from now on, it would not be classified as a miscarriage. Keeping this baby alive would no longer be down to my body alone. Should anything happen, doctors would have to at least try to intervene. These were not comforting thoughts exactly, but they were something.</p> <p>Ten days later, the whole of the UK went into coronavirus lockdown. The weekend we had quietly celebrated reaching viability also turned out to be the last weekend I would see anyone but my husband or a healthcare professional for a long time.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The initial days of confinement were softened by activity and preparation: batch-cooking, arranging deliveries, cancelling plans. I comforted myself by reading the official Covid-19 guidance from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists over and over: \u201cThere is no evidence to suggest an increased risk of miscarriage \u2026 Pregnant women are still no more likely to contract coronavirus than the general population.\u201d</p> <p>Slowly, though, as I watched the number of reported cases and deaths rise, marooned on the sofa at home, fear seeped under the door. Not a day has gone by, since finding out I was pregnant again, that I have not worried that my baby might die. But now, during a global pandemic, those nebulous anxieties hardened into something nameable. The shadow on the nursery wall had taken a solid shape.</p> <p>I woke up one night in the first week of lockdown feeling hot, my throat tight. This is it, I thought \u2013 I\u2019ve caught it<em>.</em> I had barely been outside for a fortnight, though I did get my hair cut a few days before lockdown was declared. And so the taunt went round and around in my head, as I stared at the ceiling unable to sleep: your baby could die, and all for the sake of your split ends. In the rational light of day (and feeling fine), I concluded it had probably been heartburn.</p> <p>The world shrank. I baked bread and planted herbs. I silenced notifications and deleted social media accounts from my phone. I tracked my daily steps and counted my baby\u2019s kicks using an app. Mixed in with the fear and stress of uncertainty, there was also a guilty kind of sadness for the things I would not get to do \u2013 things I had dreamed of for so long: a \u201clast\u201d holiday as a couple, showing off my bump in my first maternity dress, meeting new \u201cmum friends\u201d for coffee.</p> <p>People phoned to ask how we were coping, but it felt selfish to admit to such small sadnesses, when there were bigger worries: for my brother, who had to postpone his wedding; for my cousin, who is a nurse; for our four grandmothers, who all live alone. Then there were the worries of people I don\u2019t know, but who could so easily have been us: those who have had their fertility treatment cancelled, or who will be told they have miscarried during scan appointments they have had to attend alone, in order to protect other patients and NHS staff. At the time of writing, hospitals were being advised not to offer extra scans in early pregnancy, even for people with a history of miscarriages.</p> <p>On 17 April, week four of lockdown, I attended an appointment for a 28-week routine growth scan by myself, while Dan, following the new rules, waited in the car. A security guard at the door checked my name off a list. The sonographer and midwife I saw wore masks and visors, while the doctor conducted my appointment from the opposite end of the consulting room. I projected my voice, like a bad stage actor: \u201cNo, no family history of diabetes\u201d, and so on.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/24/88-days-trapped-in-bed-to-save-a-pregnancy-bed-rest\">\u2018Reality shrivels. This is your life now\u2019: 88 days trapped in bed to save a pregnancy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On some days, it has felt as though the pandemic has brought my experience of pregnancy closer to the curve of normality. For so long, I had felt as if I was only playing at pregnancy, like a small girl with a cushion up her jumper. I couldn\u2019t trust that I would get to do things other pregnant women take for granted. But then, suddenly, no one else was going to antenatal classes, throwing baby showers or browsing department stores for the perfect pram either.</p> <p>The temptation, when you get to where we are now, still pregnant after so many losses \u2013 and in the shadow of loss on a global scale \u2013 is to start talking about miracles. But I don\u2019t believe in miracle babies any more. I believe we should be able to put our faith in the evidence, in knowledge of how our bodies work \u2013 or don\u2019t work. That waiting and hoping isn\u2019t enough. Even so, as I sit here, in my fifth pregnancy, in the third trimester, wearing my very first pair of maternity jeans, feeling our baby kick inside me, it is hard not to consider it a wonder that any of us gets to be here at all.

They moved to the BBC in 1993 with The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer \u2013 the bigger budget meant less of the shambolic DIY charm, but even more bewildering insights into their imaginations \u2013 and then, in 1995, the spoof panel show Shooting Stars.</p> <p>Their work was unlike anything else (unless you had been a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2016/aug/24/why-vic-reeves-is-the-strangest-most-perfect-presenter-for-bbc4s-dada-season\">dada</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2016/aug/24/why-vic-reeves-is-the-strangest-most-perfect-presenter-for-bbc4s-dada-season\">ist hanging around the Cabaret Voltaire in </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2016/aug/24/why-vic-reeves-is-the-strangest-most-perfect-presenter-for-bbc4s-dada-season\">1910s Zurich</a>). This was partly because Reeves didn\u2019t watch any of his comic peers: \u201cThat\u2019s what made it unique, because you do it from a totally naive point of view.\u201d He grew up in Darlington, on the outskirts of the town \u2013 his childhood was spent running around the fields and collecting birds\u2019 eggs. His first double act was formed at school with another boy named Rod. \u201cWe created our own comedy. As far as I remember, we made it up. I didn\u2019t really watch TV, so there was no influence. I like attacking subjects without any prior knowledge of anything.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ec0a3298f9e0f11cf15bf0b2079830424e24f984\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec0a3298f9e0f11cf15bf0b2079830424e24f984/0_0_2851_2990/954.jpg\" alt=\"Self Portrait With Bigfoot by Vic Reeves\" width=\"954\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My paintings exist in half-sleep\u2019 ...

Did they never sit around together and watch TV? \u201cSaturday-night entertainment then was as awful as it is now,\u201d he says with a laugh. After school, Reeves started a mechanical engineering apprenticeship at a factory. He wrote in his autobiography (volume one \u2013 he says he keeps meaning to do volume two) that the older men there \u201clooked like they were slipping into a kind of boredom-induced madness\u201d.</p> <p>Reeves left in the 80s, moved to London and started running clubs in pubs and bars: one was a classical music club, \u201cwhich was a terrible failure\u201d; another, in the West End, seemed to consist of celebrities doing egg and spoon races (he remembers Boy George taking part). When a friend asked if he wanted to take over his comedy club, Reeves agreed. Instead of booking the acts, he thought he would perform himself, \u201cto see if I could get away with it\u201d. Does he remember the first show he did? \u201cI had a cardboard box with a picture of Sylvester Stallone taped to the front of it.\u201d He laughs. \u201cIt was really like a performance piece.\u201d</p> <p>It was here that the character Vic Reeves emerged. \u201cI think my idea was that I was going to play a sort of northern working men\u2019s club compere, that kind of thing. I thought a good name was Vic Reeves, which was like Vic Feather, the union boss then [he was general secretary of the TUC from 1969 to 1973].\u201d Within weeks, Jools Holland had spotted him and got him on his TV show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/mar/15/how-we-made-the-tube-80s-tv-pop-show\">The Tube</a>. He moved to a bigger venue \u2013 the Goldsmith\u2019s Tavern in New Cross, south London \u2013 which is where he met Mortimer, then a solicitor, who had come to see the show. \u201cIt was kind of like a free-for-all, so I roped Bob into doing stuff there.\u201d</p> <p>Reeves and Mortimer were part of the comedy explosion in the 90s. \u201cThe phrase was \u2018Comedy is the new rock\u2019n\u2019roll\u2019, and we were always on the front cover of the NME,\u201d says Reeves (they were on the cover twice and featured in the magazine regularly). \u201cBecause we referenced modern pop culture, we were the indie kids\u2019 favourite.\u201d They even became pop stars themselves: Reeves\u2019 version of Tommy Roe\u2019s Dizzy, recorded with the Wonder Stuff, got to No 1, while Reeves and Mortimer (and EMF) hit No 3 with a cover of the Monkees\u2019 I\u2019m a Believer. On tour, he says, \u201cyou\u2019d be in a hotel, like in Liverpool, and outside the hotel there\u2019s about 300 kids all shouting and screaming\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c53e06b4e93957ec454a293db13d448edb15816c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c53e06b4e93957ec454a293db13d448edb15816c/0_0_4016_2649/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vic Reeves as Colin Callin in Coronation Street, opposite Barbara Knox as Rita Tanner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"660\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soap star ...

Was there drink? Drugs? \u201cOh yeah. All that,\u201d he says. He would smoke weed, but it was mostly drinking. \u201cLager, that was our main vice. Lager and fags, very working class.\u201d Is it true they took a gun on tour (Mortimer told the comedian Richard Herring this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwyUf0OlBsM\">when he appeared on his podcast</a>)? \u201cYeah, we did. It just had blanks in it, but we used to \u2026\u201d He breaks off in laughter. Whenever they crossed a border (or sometimes a county line), \u201cwe\u2019d fire a pistol off. When we went to Scotland, it got fired off a few times.\u201d Why? \u201cI don\u2019t know. Firing a pistol with blanks in is good fun.\u201d The gun came from a military fair, he thinks.</p> <p>\u201cWe used to get dynamite as well. I don\u2019t know where that came from. I remember we had an office with Jools Holland in Greenwich and we set off a rocket. It flew off, went haywire and went in through Billy Idol\u2019s dad\u2019s bathroom window.\u201d The combination of events is so strange, so Reeves, that I don\u2019t know if he is making it up. But we both laugh.</p> <p>Did their antics \u2013 the drinking, the tomfoolery \u2013 ever get out of hand? \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t got it in me to drink that much,\u201d he says. Reeves and Mortimer went back on tour a couple of years ago and barely drank at all. \u201cIn the 90s, you\u2019d have a drink and then the next day you\u2019d feel awful and then you\u2019d have a drink to make yourself feel better. It was quite depressing, really. You get older and it\u2019s brilliant \u2013 you go: \u2018Let\u2019s go and have a detour to this pork pie shop.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He has watched comedians become superstars and sell out arena tours, but he has not felt envious. \u201cThere are two things about people who do arenas,\u201d he says. \u201cThey like the money and they like the adoration. And Bob and I are neither of those people.\u201d They did an arena show in Leeds \u201cand I thought: we\u2019re really not in touch with anyone here\u201d, he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f56da685378597dd76487000de353251c84f76cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f56da685378597dd76487000de353251c84f76cf/0_0_4242_2828/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mortimer and Reeves on the revamped Big Night Out, which returned in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Vic and Bob are pretty stupid\u2019 ...

Is that right? \u201cWe both are,\u201d he says. If you went in for pop psychology, you might suggest Reeves \u2013 the brash ringmaster of anarchy \u2013 was a bit of an outlet for its quieter creator, but Reeves disagrees. \u201cVic Reeves is not a character I would like to be like. He started off as a kind of boastful northern club compere and then ended up as a really gormless idiot. Vic and Bob are pretty stupid; Vic is slightly more stupid than Bob.\u201d</p> <p>Reeves\u2019s thigh-rubbing in the direction of female guests on Shooting Stars was always meant to be uncomfortable, but these days it looks unconscionable. \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what it means. I think it was kind of lasciviously anticipating something.\u201d </p> <p>When he appeared on Celebrity MasterChef in 2017, many people on social media were incredulous that Vic Reeves was not his real name. \u201cSome people do think that that is actually me doing Shooting Stars and Big Night Out and that\u2019s what I\u2019m like,\u201d he says. How much of his personality is in Reeves? \u201cAbsolutely none. He\u2019s the anti of what I am.\u201d</p> <p>His and Mortimer\u2019s double act has survived, he says, \u201cbecause it\u2019s completely democratic. If one idea is suggested and falls upon silence, it\u2019s brushed to one side without any regrets.\u201d They have never fallen out. \u201cWe\u2019re the most unargumentative people ever.\u201d They are supposed to be making a film together in October, something they wrote about 10 years ago about Michael Jackson\u2019s white glove, \u201cwhich is the holy grail for collectors. It\u2019s like in search of the holy grail, but we know where it is and we have to get it. It\u2019s all about celebrity memorabilia as a religion.\u201d </p> <p>Reeves has taken acting jobs \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-39998350\">he was in Coronation Street</a>, which he never misses, for a few months \u2013 but he says he never had any ambition to become a solo comic. \u201cI couldn\u2019t ever stand up in front of an audience on my own and talk to them. It would be awful; I couldn\u2019t bear to do it.\u201d His voice rises. \u201cIt looks terrifying. With Bob and me, we just act out little plays.\u201d</p> <p>He still doesn\u2019t follow comedy, nor the politics around it \u2013 such as the idea that there are some things you shouldn\u2019t joke about. \u201cWhen people say you can and can\u2019t say things, I don\u2019t know who\u2019s the authority on it,\u201d he says. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re kind, as long as you\u2019re not upsetting anyone. But that\u2019s a natural thing, isn\u2019t it? I would never do anything if I thought it was going to upset anyone.\u201d</p> <p>He wants to get back to his painting. The one with the pineapple came to him when he was in a dream-like state. \u201cI wake up in the morning with a new idea \u2013 that\u2019s how my paintings exist, really, in half-sleep.\u201d It sounds amazing, I say. \u201cIt is!\u201d he replies, sounding delighted.</p> <p><em>The Big Flower Fight will be available on Netflix on 18 May.</em></p>",

  "<p>Residents of a tiny community on the New South Wales south coast gathered at dawn on Tuesday as part of a last-ditch effort to prevent a small pocket of bushland that escaped the summer bushfires being bulldozed for a 20-hectare housing development.</p> <p>Between 70% and 80% of bushland in the Shoalhaven council area was affected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/05/south-coast-and-southern-highlands-bushfires-tear-through-areas-that-havent-burned-in-decades\">during the January fires</a>. Now the local community at Manyana wants the state government to intervene to at least postpone the destruction of one of the few unburnt areas, with the chainsaws expected to start as early as Thursday.</p> <p>Some bring their yoga mats for the daily protests and, spaced out, greet the dawn. Others arrive on bikes rugged up for a socially distanced protest.</p> <p>\u201cThe developer agreed to put it on hold for social and environmental healing, yet just three months later, in the midst of the pandemic, people losing their jobs, out of the blue he said he was starting next week,\u201d said Jorj Lowrey, a spokesperson for Manyana Matters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/03/one-road-out-the-nervous-wait-to-evacuate-a-nsw-town-ringed-by-bushfires\">One road out: the nervous wait to evacuate a NSW town ringed by bushfires</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis is the last thing this community needs, it\u2019s just too much to put on people\u2019s shoulders. They need time to deal with their post-traumatic stress disorders, to find employment and to deal with their mental health,\u201d she said.</p> <p> Lowrey said the area was home to more than 84 species of birds including the endangered powerful owl, glossy-black cockatoo, and migratory species such as rufous fantails and black-faced monarchs, as well as greater gliders.</p> <p>These are now under habitat stress due to the huge tracts of bushland that were ravaged by the Currowan fire, which burned 499,600 hectares and razed more than 300 homes during December and January.</p> <p>Nearby Conjola national park has remained closed which means there has not yet been a stocktake of the wildlife and species loss due to the fires. Plans to have the issue debated in NSW parliament have stalled due to coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cWe called for a moratorium on all land-clearing in bushfire-affected areas, Lowrey said. \u201cWe put together a petition and it was tabled in parliament, but now it\u2019s in limbo due to Covid-19.\u201d</p> <p>The developer Ozy Homes had planned to start bulldozing in January.</p> <p>It now intends to begin clearing work on stage 1, for 30 housing lots, but has agreed to pause the other stages for now.

But the Greens MP David Shoebridge said Stokes could immediately declare a new State Environmental Planning Policy (Sepp) covering bushfire-affected areas, which would allow him to protect them from land clearing while bushland recovered.</p> <p>\u201cThe only reason this development is pressing ahead is because they are worried about policy change,\u201d Shoebridge said. \u201c I am certain the planning minister is under pressure to act \u2013 and he could, by issuing a Sepp.\u201d</p> <p> Lowrey said the land clearing was causing particular angst for people who fought the fires.</p> <p>\u201cThey stopped it burning across Cunjurong Point road. They put their lives on the line to protect the houses and this piece of bush,\u201d she said.</p> <p>On <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2019/dec/31/australia-fires-live-news-nsw-victoria-bushfires-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e0a8ab38f087e8308e6645b\">New Year\u2019s Eve, the Currowan fire ripped through Conjola</a>, then crossed the lake and headed north up Bendalong Mountain, cutting off the villages of Manyana and Bendalong for days. More areas were burned on <a href=\"https://www.illawarramercury.com.au/story/6565661/south-coast-braces-for-saturdays-extreme-fire-danger/\">3 January</a>.</p> <p>The history of development at Manyana has been fraught. Three new housing estates were approved more than a decade ago, despite local protests over loss of coastal environments including wetlands.</p> <p>But because of sluggish market conditions, they became what are known as zombie developments. The sites changed hands and enough work was done to keep the development approvals alive, but development itself was paused.</p> <p> Lowrey argues that over the past decade environmental standards for new housing estates in coastal areas have become more stringent and appreciation of the value of the remaining natural environment has increased. Some developers, she says, have chosen to develop larger lots and keep more vegetation, rather than opting for the standard suburban configuration.</p> <p>Cruelly, the fires also burned part of the other planned development site, Inyadda Drive \u2013 the part of the site that is to be kept as an environmental zone. It largely spared the area to be cleared.</p> <p>\u201cIf the one thing we make happen out of this is that the law changes. You shouldn\u2019t be able to sit on a development application,\u201d Lowrey said.</p> <p>\u201cPeople get left with an out-of-date style project that\u2019s no longer viable, when something much better could be done: larger blocks with dedicated green space on each lot.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>New Zealanders will be asked at September\u2019s national election whether they want to pass a bill<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/18/new-zealand-to-hold-referendum-on-legalising-recreational-cannabis\"> that would legalise cannabis</a> and regulate how it is used and sold. This will include producing and selling fresh and dried cannabis, including plants and seeds \u2013 for people over 20 years old. The change would impose more stringent restrictions than the rules around sales of alcohol and tobacco.</p> <h2><strong>What are the key points of the proposed changes?</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p>Those under 20 caught with cannabis would not be convicted but would instead receive a \u201chealth-based\u201d response, such as a fine or education. Those selling to under 20s would face jail time.</p></li> <li><p>Cannabis use would be restricted to private residences or licensed premises, such as specialist cannabis stores.</p></li> <li><p>People would be able to buy 14 grams of cannabis a day \u2013 something New Zealand\u2019s main opposition party has previously decried as too much \u2013 with a THC content of up to 15%, which even New Zealand\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/415670/lower-thc-limit-needed-under-proposed-cannabis-regime-drug-foundation\">pro-legalisation Drug Foundation</a> says is probably too much. The stronger the product, the higher the taxes that will be applied to it.</p></li> <li><p>Advertising of cannabis products would not be allowed, nor would walking around smoking it in public.</p></li> <li><p>Companies would have to choose between either growing or selling the drug, and there would be a limit to how much of the national stock a firm could hold. Imports and exports would not be permitted.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Would people be able to buy edible cannabis products?</h2> <p>Not straight away. A new cannabis regulatory authority could approve the sale of edibles at a later date, but novelty cannabis products like gummy lollies would be barred, as would any other edible designed to appeal to children.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/04/cannabis-prohibition-doesnt-work-anywhere-its-new-zealands-turn-to-legalise-it\">Cannabis prohibition doesn't work anywhere. It's New Zealand's turn to legalise it | Helen Clark</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Would private citizens be allowed to grow their own?</h2> <p>Yes, with up to two plants per person, and a maximum of four plants per household.</p> <h2>What question will New Zealanders be asked on election day?</h2> <p>Voters will check yes or no on whether they support the new law that the government has proposed. That requires them to familiarise themselves with the content of the law, rather than simply voting on the issue. The justice ministry has set up a website to provide officially-approved information about the proposal.</p> <h2>Is the law likely to be approved?</h2> <p>Not according to the latest figures. A One News Colmar Brunton <a href=\"https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/new-zealanders-likely-vote-against-cannabis-legalisation-1-news-colmar-brunton-poll\">poll in February</a> said 51% of people would vote against legalising cannabis, with 39% voting to allow it. The rest of the 1,000 people polled said they would opt out of voting or didn\u2019t know what they would choose.</p> <p>Importantly, more than 50% of voters need to say yes to the law change for it to be considered by parliament.</p> <h2>Is the vote binding?</h2> <p>No. But Andrew Geddis, a law professor at the University of Otago, said while there\u2019s no legal imperative for an incoming government to abide by the referendum result, it would be \u201cpretty hard for them not to act\u201d on a \u201crelatively strong majority\u201d voting yes to the law change. That would be the case even if there was a change of government, he said.</p> <p>But the law won\u2019t have passed through parliament before the election, and on its route through a select committee process, it could be amended from the bill the public voted on.</p> <h2>Isn\u2019t there another referendum at this election as well?</h2> <p>Yes. A second referendum, on voluntary euthanasia, is also scheduled for September.</p> <p>The legislation that would enable it has already been passed through parliament, and the public will vote on whether that bill should be enacted into law, which would happen one year after the referendum.</p> <p>While that vote isn\u2019t binding either, Geddis said the result would be more difficult for an incoming government to ignore given the current crop of parliamentarians has already passed the bill.</p> <p>The double referendum means New Zealanders will be asked to vote on four things on polling day, which is still scheduled for 19 September despite the Covid-19 pandemic: the party they want in power, their local member of parliament, euthanasia and cannabis.</p> <p>\u201cTwo months ago we were all worried that these referendums would crowd out the election proper,\u201d Geddis said. \u201cNow the problem is that with Covid-19, is there going to be any sort of room for the merits of these proposals to be thrashed out?\u201d</p> <h2>Could New Zealand delay its referendums due to the pandemic?</h2> <p>Geddis says no, unless the election date was changed. Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, said in late April that she had no plans to do that.</p>",

He spent his final days on a ventilator at Montefiore Medical Center.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e13ce5b023dd3eb071d6196908ecc1de6f417841\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e13ce5b023dd3eb071d6196908ecc1de6f417841/0_180_4176_2506/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The procession of emergency vehicles makes its way out of Denver International Airport.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The procession of emergency vehicles makes its way out of Denver International Airport.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen H Richardson/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-04T12:19:35.980Z\">at 1.19pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5eaff8d98f0884a76e10ca8c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-04T11:51:15.402Z\">12.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In the words of that meme with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/5/11592622/this-is-fine-meme-comic\">the dog with the coffee in the burning room</a>, \u201cthis is fine\u201d:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1257258214615367680\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u201cConcast\u201d should open up a long overdue Florida Cold Case against Psycho Joe Scarborough.

I always start with the basic figures, from Johns Hopkins University in Maryland:</p> <ul> <li>US cases: 1,157,875</li> <li>US deaths: 67,677</li> <li>New York cases: 316,415</li> <li>New York deaths: 24,708</li> </ul> <p>New York is the hotspot, other states are badly hit: New Jersey (7,871) and Michigan (4,053) and Massachusetts (4,004) have had the next most deaths.</p> <p>The weekend saw Donald Trump lead his country through the crisis mostly by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidJHarrisJr/status/1256935288749752321\">retweeting conspiracy theories</a> and tweeting complaints before staging on Sunday night <strong>a Fox News town hall</strong> which saw more of the latter.</p> <p>Fox News put the event at the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall, prompting the 45th president to complain that he had been treated worse by the press than the 16th \u2013 who, remember, guided the Union through a horrific civil war, managed to legislate slavery out of existence and was shot dead on a trip to the theatre.</p> <p>Among other points, Trump boosted efforts in more than half of the states <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/03/michigan-gretchen-whitmer-lockdown-protest-racism\">to reopen their economies</a> despite warnings from public health experts that it could well be too soon to do so safely; said there would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/trump-adviser-larry-kudlow-coronavirus-relief-aid-sanctuary-cities\">no more stimulus aid</a> for struggling states <strong>without a payroll tax cut</strong>, a controversial move to say the least; and said he had \u201csaved hundreds of thousands of lives\u201d before projecting a final death toll of around 100,000, up from his previous estimate of 65,000 (see 67,677 figure above). </p> <p>Earlier, White House task force member Dr Deborah Birx <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/05/03/birxs-fox-news-sunday-interview-lays-bare-discord-trumps-coronavirus-response/\">told Fox News Sunday</a>: \u201cOur projections have always been between 100,000 and 240,000 American lives lost, and that\u2019s with full mitigation and us learning from each other of how to social distance\u201d.</p> <p>Trump also said \u201c<strong>We may have to put out a fire</strong>\u201d, when asked if he was worried about a coronavirus resurgence in the fall.</p> <p>And he said the administration would present evidence for <strong>its claim the virus originated in a Chinese laboratory</strong> \u201cat the right time\u201d. The right time obviously wasn\u2019t ABC\u2019s Sunday talkshow earlier, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/mike-pompeo-donald-trump-coronavirus-chinese-laboratory\">secretary of state Mike Pompeo made the claim</a> and said he\u2019d seen evidence, but didn\u2019t of course provide any.</p> <p>Later the vice-president, Mike Pence, admitted his mistake in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/28/mike-pence-face-mask-mayo-clinic-visit-coronavirus\"><strong tabindex=\"-1\">not wearing a mask</strong></a> while visiting the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota last week \u2013 a rare enough step in this administration.</p> <p>Anyway, that Lincoln quote. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/11/abraham-lincoln-verge-book-ted-widmer-interview\">I\u2019m a Lincolnhead</a>, so indulge me.
