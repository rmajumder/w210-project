The Associated Press reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Long before there was a global coronavirus pandemic, brick-and-mortar retailers struggled to get people to walk through their doors instead of shopping online.</p> <p>Now those retailers are faced with an even more Herculean task: how to stay on people\u2019s minds and more importantly their pocketbooks when many of their store doors are closed.</p> <p>More than 250,000 stores like Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom and Nike that sell non-essential merchandise have temporarily shuttered since mid-March in response to the pandemic. Thats 60% of overall U.S. retail square footage, according to Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.</p> <p>\u201cRetail has hung a closed sign on the door literally and metaphorically,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cThis is the most catastrophic crisis that retail has faced worse than the financial crisis in 2008, worse than 9/11. Almost overnight, the retail economy shifted from being about things people want to things that they need.\u201d</p> <p>Some retailers have responded to the challenge by coming up with creative ways to stay relevant. Nike, for instance, introduced workout apps in China when the coronavirus first surfaced there, resulting in an 80% increase in users within the quarter and a 30% increase in online sales. It\u2019s now pushing a similar campaign in the U.S. and Europe.</p> <p>Yoga pants maker Lululemon is holding online classes in North America and Europe after gaining thousands of new followers in China on WeChat. Lululemon CEO Calvin McDonald told analysts during a recent call that during its first week of closures in the U.S., it saw nearly 170,000 customers join Lululemon for its live classes.</p> <p>Small businesses are also pivoting in order to hold onto customers. Camp, a new toy chain that set itself apart from online retailers by doubling down on the physical experience, is hosting virtual birthday parties and creating curated gift boxes now that its five stores have gone dark. Politics &amp; Prose, a popular Washington D.C. bookstore, was also forced to temporarily close and is now starting to stream author talks online and offering a curbside pickup service.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e9395128f082dfd549d5368\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-12T22:31:48.406Z\">11.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, has outlined his plan to safely reopen the United States in an op-ed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/opinion/joe-biden-coronavirus-reopen-america.html\">published in today\u2019s New York Times</a>. </p> <p>His three steps include: 1) getting the number of new cases down significantly through continued social distancing and improved supply lines to our hospitals with a more thorough deployment of the Defense Production Act; 2) the establishment of widespread, easily available and prompt testing with contact tracing strategy that protects privacy; and 3) increasing the capacity of our healthcare system to protect against the potential flare-up of cases when economic activity reopens.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cFor more Americans to go back to their jobs, the president needs to do better at his job,\u201d Biden wrote. </p> <p>As if Trump, the great counterpuncher, was going to take that lying down.

coronavirus tsar Peter Navarro, about whom Julian Borger, our world affairs editor, wrote <a

southern hemisphere experiences in the virus might teach us about the seasonality or otherwise of Covid-19, Dr Nabarro offered a disturbing thought: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We think <strong>it is going to be a virus that stalks the human race for quite a long time</strong> to come until we can all have a vaccine that will protect us and that there will be small outbreaks that will emerge sporadically and they will break through our defenses.</p> </blockquote> <p>Nabarro was also asked about Donald Trump\u2019s criticism of the WHO and his threat this week \u2013 how serious he was was, as ever, unclear \u2013 to withdraw US funding for the international healthcare body:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The World Health Organization actually works on behalf of all the governments in the world. And it operates within mandates that are given to it. And, and we have to rely on information that\u2019s received from different governments. And that then permits us to work out what\u2019s going on \u2026 but <strong>we know that there will be many things that are found to have perhaps not been done as well as they could have been done</strong>. And we\u2019re anticipating there\u2019ll be lots of examinations afterwards. </p> <p>Right now, we have to move forward. We have to get the best possible cooperation. I just heard you discussing with the head of the FDA some of the challenges, the things that we\u2019re learning about this virus all the time. That\u2019s why we need a strong WHO, a trusted WHO. And we hope all leaders will continue to work with us in that way.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Meet the Press Chuck Todd asked</strong> that given <strong>\u201c</strong>the United States is anywhere \u2013 approximately 15% to 20% of your annual budget \u2026 how devastating would it be if the United States pulled its funding?\u201d</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, you know, <strong>we\u2019re right in the middle of this massive epic struggle. Every single human being in the world is affected by it</strong>. Businesses are really in trouble. Communities are in distress. I really do hope that all nations will not find any reason to make threats or other such things that will undermine our capacity to bring together all the best knowledge that we can find. </p> <p>\u201cAnd of course we love our partnership with the United States. We work with United States scientists for years \u2026 and <strong>that would be so unfortunate if anything happened to lessen that cooperation</strong>. </p> <p>\u201cI know that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tedros-adhanom\"><strong>Tedros [Adhanom Ghebreyesus], the director general</strong></a>, has had direct discussions with the president of the US.

Last week, the Trump announced he would establish a bipartisan \u201cOpening Our Country Council\u201d to weigh in on issue.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of very smart people, a lot of professionals, doctors and business leaders are a lot of things that go into a decision like that,\u201d he told Pirro. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be based on a lot of facts and a lot of instinct also. Whether we like it or not, there is a certain instinct to it.</p> <p>The council, Trump added, would include \u201csome of the most distinguished leaders in virtually every field, including politics and business and medical. And we\u2019ll be making that decision fairly soon.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s phone-in came ahead of an early morning tweet on Sunday in which he attacked <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-response.html\"><strong>a New York Times report</strong></a> which said the White House failed to act on several explicit security agency warnings in January about the potential for coronavirus to spread to the US.</p> <p>\u201cSo now the Fake News is tracing the CoronaVirus origins back to Europe, NOT China. This is a first! I wonder what the Failing New York Times got for this one? Are there any NAMED sources? They were recently thrown out of China like dogs, and obviously want back in. Sad!\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s interpretation of the report appeared to misconstrue scientific evidence that the spread of coronavirus to the Eastern US came through Europe \u2013 but not that it originated there.</p> <p>The claim comes despite evidence that trade adviser Peter Navarro warned Trump in 29 January <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/us/politics/navarro-warning-trump-coronavirus.html\">memo</a> that as many as 500,000 Americans could die if the virus was allowed to spread across the US unchecked. A day later, health and human services secretary Alex Azar issued a similar warning. The White House did not issue national social distancing guidelines until 16 March. </p> <p>On Saturday, Trump vowed to rebuild the US economy, which has suffered trillions of dollars in damage from the outbreak, as a tribute to those who have died. Trump predicted that the economy to rebound like a \u201crocket ship\u201d because Americans have combated the coronavirus the \u201cright way\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe did it the right way. We took care of social distancing and all of the things, words that nobody ever heard before, frankly, and phrases. But if we didn\u2019t do that, we would have pulled through it,\u201d Trump said. </p> <p>\u201cThere were estimates, 2.2 million people. Well, if you cut that in more than half and you said a million and cut that in half.

The 28-year-old German is the defending champion here at Augusta, and went into the Tournament full of confidence (and the wiener schnitzel he served up at the Champions Dinner). He\u2019s living up to his billing, bouncing back from a disappointing opening round of 74 with a 68-69 salvo. He\u2019s right in the mix, hoping to become only the second player after Jack Nicklaus (1965 and 1966) to successfully defend his Masters title. Who can stop him?</p> <p><strong>How about the new world number two?</strong> Seve Ballesteros already has two green jackets to his name, and he\u2019s in the mood to win a third. Specifically, he in a <em>bad</em> mood: he\u2019s been raging all week at PGA Tour commissioner Deane Beman, who has banished him from the American tour for a year, on account of not playing enough golf to earn his card. (To be fair to Seve, his volatile volleys at Beman aren\u2019t a patch on those sent down by Mac O\u2019Grady, who has called Beman a \u201cthief with a capital T\u201d and compared him to Adolf Hitler!) But there\u2019s no keeping Seve from Augusta, and he\u2019s desperate to make a told-you-so statement. He\u2019s one off the lead after three rounds.</p> <p><strong>Or is the Great White Shark about to land his first major? </strong>Greg Norman, only ranked six in the world but surely on an upwardly mobile journey that\u2019ll take the man from down under straight to the top, leads at the 54-hole mark after a fine 68 yesterday.</p> <p><strong>And then there\u2019s Nick Price. </strong>The young Zimbabwean, who came so close to winning the Open Championship four years ago, broke the course record at Augusta National yesterday. He made ten birdies on his way to 63, very nearly becoming the first man to shoot 62 in a major; sadly his 20-footer on 18 looped the loop in slow motion and failed to drop. Millimetres from history. He\u2019ll be a bit higher than #52 in the world next week.</p> <p><strong>Also lurking: </strong>the resurgent Tom Watson (#4) coming out of a two-year slump; the reigning Open champion Sandy Lyle (#3) whose big drives and draws are perfectly suited to this course; Tom Kite (#16) who has finished in the top ten at Augusta nine times in the last 11 years; Donnie Hammond (#99) who won his first PGA Tour event, the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, at La Quinta in California earlier this year; and Tommy Nakajima (#7) who has been clocking up wins on the Japanese tour for fun (21 in the last four years).</p> <p><strong>But maybe it\u2019s going to be a step too far for 46-year-old Jack Nicklaus, and not just because he\u2019s got four shots to make up on Norman.</strong> Nicklaus has won only twice since 1980, his powers seemingly very much on the wane: he was in contention for three PGA Tour tournaments last season, but couldn\u2019t convert any of those good positions into a win. Most unlike the Golden Bear. For the record, Jack is world number 33, though to be fair, had the R&amp;A been cobbling together these rankings back in the sixties and seventies, he might have spent the odd week or two at the toppermost of the poppermost.</p> <p><strong>After the third round, the top of the leader board looked like this: </strong></p> <p><strong><em>-6: </em></strong><em>Greg Norman<br> <strong>-5: </strong>Seve Ballesteros, Bernhard Langer, Donnie Hammond, Nick Price<br> <strong>-4: </strong>Tommy Nakajima, Tom Kite, Tom Watson<br> <strong>-2: </strong>Danny Edwards, Gary Koch, Sandy Lyle, Mark McCumber, Jack Nicklaus, Corey Pavin, Bob Tway</em></p> <p><strong>The weather today is utterly gorgeous, perfect conditions for golf. </strong>Sunny, but not too blistering, and very little wind. Surely someone, somewhere, will seize the chance to shoot a round for the ages? Let\u2019s hope so! With so many of the world\u2019s top players in contention, there\u2019s a great chance.

It had been waning before the virus, with the widespread use of contactless payments. In the past month many businesses have stopped accepting cash out of concern the virus could spread through notes and coins, and <a href=\"https://www.itnews.com.au/news/woolwooths-coles-to-raise-contactless-pin-free-limit-to-200-545959\">Coles and Woolworths have increased the permitted contactless payment to $200</a>.

The federal and family courts are conducting hearings via telephone, and magistrates courts have moved a range of procedural matters to email or telephone conference. Non-urgent contested hearings have been adjourned, leading to a spike in cases being resolved by mediation. This is particularly true in the family court, says the Law Council of Australia president Pauline Wright.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I am hearing across the profession is that many people are trying really hard now to settle matters without the need for waiting for a hearing,\u201d Wright says. \u201cIt means that the people affected by family law disputes are actually coming together to agree more often than would ordinarily be the case. So this pandemic has done some good in bringing people together in that sense.\u201d</p> <p>Wright says lawyers may argue for some changes \u2013 such as an increased accommodation for telephone or video hearings \u2013 to remain in place after the crisis is over, because they save lawyers\u2019 time and therefore their clients\u2019 money.</p> <p>\u201cIf I go from my office to the local court it will take me 40 minutes to get there but while I am there I might be waiting for another 40 minutes or an hour before my client\u2019s matter gets heard, and it might be a five-minute matter,\u201d she says.</p> <p>But Wright says other changes, like a decision in Victoria to give priority to judge-only trials, should not continue after restrictions are lifted.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to see changes brought into place just for the sake of efficiency, because efficiency does not mean fairness or justice,\u201d she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some people may emerge from the pandemic with a loathing for working from home, and companies will have to adjust</p> <footer> <cite>Alex Prineas</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Pharmacy Guild has also argued that the six-month extension of the continued dispensing of emergency medicines scheme should continue after the crisis. The scheme allows pharmacists to provide known customers with one refill of their medication per year without a script and still have access to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. </p> <h2>A catalyst for change</h2> <p>The changes most likely to stick, says Eslake, are those that had already begun before the coronavirus hit.</p> <p>Workplaces already offering flexible working conditions to staff may take that model further after six months and continue to allow all their staff to work from home. Other companies that previously resisted may learn that they have not lost productivity by letting employees work from their kitchen tables.</p> <p>That could result in a lasting change in the way Australians work, says Eslake, especially as companies realise it\u2019s cheaper not to have to pay commercial rent.</p> <p>However Alex Prineas, an equity analyst from Morningstar Australasia, says some people may emerge from the pandemic with a loathing for working from home, and companies will have to adjust accordingly.</p> <p>\u201cHuman nature is not going to have changed, we are still going to need to socialise, to meet in person to communicate better than we do over the phone,\u201d Prineas says. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/morrison-insists-nothing-lasts-forever-especially-the-coronavirus-spending-spree\">Morrison reminds us nothing lasts forever \u2013 especially the coronavirus spending spree | Malcolm Farr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whatever the office looks like, it will be cheaper.

Immigration will become even more important, and could cause conflict if not managed against a growing view among nationalists that isolationism was the right approach all along.</p> <p>Allen says the socioeconomic impact of the virus will be much harder on and felt for much longer by women, whose average superannuation balance on retirement is already lower.</p> <p>The chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Rob Sims, cites e-health and e-education services as one area where Australia may be permanently changed.</p> <p>But mostly, he says, Australia will go back to normal.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m certainly going to want a haircut when this is over,\u201d Sims says. \u201cI\u2019m going to go to my office and get a cup of coffee from the coffee shop at the bottom of my floor, I\u2019m going to catch up with friends and go out to a restaurant four or five times in the first week.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be interesting changes out of this but I largely see things going back to normal.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Additional reporting by Ben Butler</p>",

  "<p>If you attempt a yoga pose and fall flat on your face but no one is around to see it, did it really happen?</p> <p>Somewhere in the space between warrior II pose and downward-facing dog, I topple and land heavily on my yoga mat, on the floor of my bedroom in the social isolation of my elderly mother\u2019s Queensland home.</p> <p>I decide it didn\u2019t happen; my laptop is perched on a stool in front of me but the video is off.

I\u2019m panting furiously and my monkey mind is wandering to my leftover tuna-macaroni casserole lunch sitting heavily in my stomach. The tuna came from the depths of my mother\u2019s bottomless pantry. The can had a little rust on it but, mindful of social distancing rules and empty supermarket shelves, we had ploughed on with the casserole endeavour. I decide it\u2019s indigestion, not food poisoning.</p> <p>Kel and the gallery of students on my screen have moved on when I return my attention to the class. \u201cThis practice is yours. If you need to do a little less, you can.\u201d</p> <p>Now she announces that we will move into crow pose. She doesn\u2019t hear the bad words I use to tell her \u201cno way\u201d. I most certainly will do a bit less. Just so you know, the crow pose \u2013 bakasana \u2013 goes something like this: start with a squat, as you might over a bush toilet. Follow that by manoeuvring both knees into your armpits. Come up on to tippy-toes, plant your outstretched hands on the ground, look forward, lift both feet off the ground, hover. It\u2019s mad, it\u2019s acrobatic, it\u2019s totally beyond me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"A yoga teacher in crow pose during a Power Living live stream class.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

I\u2019m diverted by my feet. They need a pedicure. My mind wanders to the women who speak little English who run my local nail salon in Sydney. How are they doing? Are they eligible for Mr Morrison\u2019s assistance?</p> <p>When I return my brain to class, Kel has moved on through the aviary, through half-pigeon and on to open eagle. She issues rapid-fire instructions. Vinyasa is a style of yoga in which postures and breath merge seamlessly into a continuous, flowing form. I\u2019m getting tired. I\u2019m pouring with sweat. My upper arms and glutes are feeling the burn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/31/the-dance-floor-is-a-religious-experience-the-unselfconscious-retro-joy-of-the-home-dance-workout\">'The dancefloor is a religious experience': the unselfconscious retro joy of the home dance workout</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHave you got the toes going on, have you got your bum searching backwards?

Right hand searches for the floor \u2026 you can use a drink bottle, a coffee table, a couch, whatever you\u2019ve got nearby.\u201d Some ad-libbing is required when you don\u2019t have a yoga studio\u2019s block props handy.</p> <p>Kel flicks her eye across the multiple students in her gallery, in bedrooms and living rooms and backyards around Australia and overseas, and suggests an adjustment in posture here, a change in pace there. \u201cJust tuck your chin in a little there, hon, that\u2019s it, yeah.\u201d</p> <p>I am an undisciplined and irregular yogi but I know now that it is vital I spend more time with Kel in the weeks ahead. The fact that I need to sign up for class to receive the Zoom link will make me more likely to actually follow through with it than if I turn to YouTube yoga videos. And next time I will turn my webcam on: if Kel can see me I will feel more accountable, less inclined to slow my pace or slack off. She will also be able to suggest adjustments to my poses. I might even be able to pretend that I\u2019m in a real live yoga class rather than in my mother\u2019s spare bedroom.</p> <p>When I finish this livestreamed class I will have a Zoom chat with Kel and Power Living Adelaide\u2019s founder, Triton Tunis-Mitchell. They will tell me that their Zoom-powered livestream classes have allowed former students living interstate and overseas to rejoin the studio. \u201cPeople are coming back to things they know really support them. If there was a time to practise regularly, this would be it. If there was a time to meditate regularly, this would be it.\u201d</p> <p>Now we move into shavasana \u2013 corpse pose \u2013 that moment of rest and relief at the end of a yoga class. I see snowdrifts of dust under the bed.

  "<p>Last week the funeral for Pat McCann was held at the St Peter Julian Eymard Catholic church in Mooroolbark, in Melbourne\u2019s east.</p> <p>Her sons, Charlie and Mike, read the eulogy. There was a singer, an organist and a full mass led by a family friend and priest. Tommy Roe\u2019s Party Girl, a track McCann and her family knew by heart, was beamed out into the church.</p> <p>Her four children and their partners, each sitting two metres apart, listened in. One grandson, trapped with his wife in Guatemala, followed the service online. A granddaughter, back from Brazil, tuned in from Melbourne\u2019s Crown Promenade hotel where she has been in quarantine.</p> <p>At the end of the service, cameras followed the casket out to the waiting hearse. The small group at the church went to the cemetery for the burial and, later, the wider circle of family and friends got together for a drink over the video conferencing app Zoom.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e8f1802a08f4ec5946e154a368ab295d67a03b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e8f1802a08f4ec5946e154a368ab295d67a03b0/0_0_1500_1126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mike, Pat and Charlie in front with Kathy, Maureen and daughter-in-law Angela.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"751\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike, Pat and Charlie in front with Kathy, Maureen and daughter-in-law Angela.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike McCann</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is a funeral in the time of coronavirus.

Death is a time of distress for the bereaved and people have an innate need to be with each other for support.</p> <p>The fact mourners are permitted to congregate as a group of up to 10 \u2013 while weddings are restricted to five people, and all other types of gathering to two \u2013 speaks to the significance of the role funerals play.</p> <p>But choosing those 10 people when ordinarily there might be 500, is complicating the grieving process for many, as is the requirement to stand two metres from someone you would naturally comfort with a hug or a kiss.</p> <p>\u201cAll the things we know about funerals and how they can help that transition in people\u2019s lives when they\u2019ve lost someone have been taken away,\u201d Barrett says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"071216446c759be60a6ff27c0143373ed693b6c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/071216446c759be60a6ff27c0143373ed693b6c7/0_0_5494_3663/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cemetery at sunset.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt means we have to come up with alternatives to help people in that transition.\u201d</p> <p>In recent weeks, Barrett has witnessed anger and guilt among families grappling with the restrictions. </p> <p>He estimates that among the association\u2019s membership there has been a doubling in reports of people choosing not to have funerals \u2013 from about 10-15% to 20-30% \u2013 or to delay a service until social distancing measures ease. He worries this will prolong the grieving process for many.</p> <p>But amid the sadness and frustration, there is also understanding, creativity and innovation.

Since the arrival of Covid-19 measures, it hasn\u2019t been used once.</p> <p>Instead, families opt to hold a service at home. Many of the usual traditions are still there: a table with memories of the deceased, a selection of songs they loved. There\u2019s a greater emphasis on sharing photos.</p> <p>Funerals have become more invidualised through time. Watkins thinks Covid-19 is bringing greater focus on those personal touches and new ways of finding meaning. She\u2019s relieved people are continuing to hold a gathering of some form, given the role funerals play in the early stages of grief.</p> <p>\u201cPeople have been surprisingly accepting that this is a serious virus \u2013 I haven\u2019t had anyone objecting greatly to the fact they have these restricted numbers,\u201d she says. \u201cThe funerals we\u2019re having are still meaningful.\u201d</p> <p>James MacLeod is the managing director of Tobin Brothers Funerals in Melbourne, one of the largest private funeral companies in Australia. </p> <p>In January it helped the China Funeral Association to write guidelines for funeral procedures after the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan.</p> <p>When it became clear Australia would be affected by shutdowns the company wrote to the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, stressing the importance of funerals.</p> <p>MacLeod argued they were more essential than ever at a time when people were distressed at not being able to visit older family members in aged-care facilities.</p> <p>\u201cSome will no doubt see this as a letter written from self-interest,\u201d MacLeod wrote. \u201cI do however write \u2026 as a concerned individual for the long-term mental health of the client families that we care for.\u201d</p> <p>Tobin Brothers has established a mortuary specifically for patients who have died from Covid-19. There are strict handling procedures, including personal protective equipment to be worn by staff.</p> <p>Family members \u2013 for both Covid and non-Covid deaths \u2013 are permitted to view the body at a distance in a special room.</p> <p>MacLeod says viewings have helped families who in some cases have not seen their loved one in the weeks before their death.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s so much these people are going through \u2013 we\u2019ve got to do all we can and more to assist them,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cThat physical response that seeing their loved ones brings is really important.\u201d</p> <p>Since the introduction of the restrictions, MacLeod says, some funerals have been attended by as many as 700 people online.</p> <h2>A big struggle for Muslim communities</h2> <p>In western Sydney, Ahmad Malas is the operations director for the Lebanese Muslim Association.</p> <p>The association is the caretaker for a number of mosques, including Australia\u2019s largest at Lakemba.

That\u2019s a really big thing people are coming to terms with.\u201d</p> <p>Muslims bury their dead as soon as possible as a means of honouring the deceased. Traditional mourning rites involve washing, shrouding and viewing of a body, followed by communal prayer in a mosque.</p> <p>Gatherings of more than a thousand people are common. Communal prayer is followed by burial and then condolences and mourning at the family home.</p> <p>Malas says the restrictions mean viewing the body can only occur at a distance, with no touching or kissing, and the closure of the mosques means communal prayer is held in the funeral parlour.</p> <p>Families now unable to host people in their home have turned to Facebook and WhatsApp.</p> <p>He has had regular calls from people in distress.</p> <p>\u201cPeople come together at a time of death and they can\u2019t do that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt really tests the ties between people and those relationships.</p> <p>\u201cI guess the positives are people are trying to make an effort to stay in touch with one another. They\u2019re contacting their loved ones. They\u2019re trying to do everything they can to stay in touch.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018It was the best we could make it for him\u2019</h2> <p>Scott Dawson used to say mixed netball was an untapped resource for dating. He and his wife, Jemillah, met when they were recruited by friends to the same netball team in Bunbury, Western Australia.</p> <p>Five years ago, Scott, 35, was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Initial treatment went well but the tumour returned aggressively shortly after the birth of their daughter, Maisie, in May last year.</p> <p>Dawson\u2019s health had started deteriorating when the government first limited funeral gatherings to 50 people.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7df916f6b3212030dc07b7f57681aa02d29f3dc6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7df916f6b3212030dc07b7f57681aa02d29f3dc6/0_0_4452_2963/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jemillah and Scott Dawson with Maisie and their dog, Bruin, in August last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jemillah and Scott Dawson with Maisie and their dog, Bruin, in August last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hayley Butler Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHis mum and I looked at each other and thought \u2018Oh no\u2019,\u201d Jemillah Dawson says.</p> <p>By the time of his funeral on 1 April, that number was down to 10. Immediate family and his oldest friend attended in person, and more than 250 watched the funeral service online. Scott was a popular bloke, with friends all over the country and overseas.</p> <p>\u201cIt was really hard, but we tried to keep it as simple as possible,\u201d Jemillah says.</p> <p>\u201cThe celebrant was good in the lead-up to the service. She said she\u2019d done a few funerals with limited numbers already.</p> <p>\u201cThe feedback we got from people was that they did feel like they were being acknowledged by her.\u201d</p> <p>But she felt emotionally torn on the day although the service was better than she had expected and \u201cthe best we could make it for him\u201d.</p> <p>Scott was a huge Carlton fan. All guests, including those tuning in online, wore navy blue. A Carlton flag was draped over the coffin and the club theme song played as mourners left the chapel. The same song played when Scott and Jemillah walked into the reception on their wedding day in 2017.</p> <p>Not being able to surround herself with friends and loved ones has made Jemillah feel as though she\u2019s \u201cnot really going through the normal grieving process\u201d. There will be a larger get-together when things return to normal, but at the moment processing complex emotions feels delayed.</p> <p>\u201cI did feel really hollow afterwards because we couldn\u2019t have a wake or anything,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cSo there was no time to debrief or cry or laugh with each other. That was the hardest part of it, not being able to have people come and talk to you and hug you.\u201d</p>",

Those are both pretty uncomfortable states for us,\u201d says Kate Sweeny, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Riverside and principal investigator at Life Events Lab.</p> <p>\u201cFrom an evolutionary perspective, if you don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming or you can\u2019t do anything about what\u2019s coming, in both cases that\u2019s a pretty dangerous situation ... we are wired to be uncomfortable in those situations and be motivated to find ways to resolve our uncertainty or regain control. When we can\u2019t do that, it\u2019s very challenging,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Sweeny has co-authored numerous research papers on navigating uncertain waiting periods. This includes an article that is soon to be published, for which her team studied the effects of mindfulness and flow on the wellbeing of quarantined residents in Wuhan, China in February 2020.</p> <p>The results were consistent with their past research, and showed that both mindfulness and flow are solid approaches to beating the stress of uncertain periods.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/14/the-mindfulness-conspiracy-capitalist-spirituality\">PR problem</a> that mindfulness has right now,\u201d Sweeny says. \u201cBut having said that, I do think it\u2019s really custom-made for periods of uncertainty when your mind is racing, you\u2019re dealing with a lot of uncontrollable thoughts, you\u2019re thinking a lot about the future, maybe thinking back to how life used to be \u2026 Mindfulness is really about turning down the volume on those thoughts, not letting them take you away, and really appreciating what is in the present moment. In a tough moment like this, that\u2019s hard, but mindfulness teaches you to accept that and process it without judgment.\u201d</p> <p>If you\u2019ve tried and failed at meditation, the good news is that Sweeny and team have found another approach that has <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-47332-001\">yielded positive results</a>: flow states. \u201cFlow states are the feeling you get when you\u2019re doing an activity that is completely captivating of your attention,\u201d says Sweeny.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/10/sesame-street-coronavirus-advice-parents-children\">Sesame Street's pandemic advice for parents: 'Find joy within the moment'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Video games that get harder as you improve, reward you when you\u2019re doing well and let you know when you\u2019re doing poorly, are a good example. And they don\u2019t have to be complex games. In their studies, Sweeny and her researchers have found that even Tetris has proven effective in helping people achieve a flow state.</p> <p>The same can be said of gardening, exercises of various sorts, learning another language and other hobbies you\u2019re trying to get better at. For some people, even cleaning the house can help them enter a flow state.</p> <p>Fortunately for those who have a whole household of people waiting with them, flow activities can be done collectively \u2013 for example through backyard sports or board games that are not only fun but difficult too.</p> <p>\u201cWhat you want with a flow activity is something that challenges you, but not too much, and you\u2019re getting feedback on your progress ... we know this really helps to make the experience [of waiting] more tolerable.\u201d She suggests a good test of whether something can bring you into a flow state is if \u201cit\u2019s the kind of activity you can\u2019t do if you\u2019ve got to leave the house in 15 minutes, because you know you will just completely lose track of time\u201d.</p> <p>If you think you\u2019ve got your anxiety sorted with a steady diet of television, it might be worth reassessing. Sweeny says that watching movies and reading books can be a positive way to pass the time if your mind is clear, you\u2019re calm and able to become completely absorbed. But chances are, if you\u2019re struggling with anxiety or worry, books and films might not be enough to quieten those voices.</p> <p>In contrast, activities like assembling an elaborate puzzle or getting engaged in some kind of work project are more likely to settle even the noisiest minds quite effectively.</p> <p>While mindfulness and flow are skills we can work on, there are other factors that can affect our wellbeing during a period of waiting. People who have a lot of social support tend to fare better. According to Sweeny, \u201csomeone who has a very busy schedule might actually be a bit better at waiting than someone who is left with very little else to do but worry\u201d.</p> <p>So when you\u2019re done with your video calls and ticking things off your to-do list (now is a good time to start using one, if you haven\u2019t already), keep chasing flow.

  "<p>Keir Starmer\u2019s immediate task, as the new leader of the opposition, is to scrutinise and hold to account the government\u2019s handling of the most serious public health crisis for a century.

As Sir Keir revealed the makeup of his shadow team last week, the first drumbeats of dissent became audible. On the left, there was dismay at the return of well-known critics of Jeremy Corbyn, such as Liz Kendall, Wes Streeting and Pat McFadden. One MP <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5b48bf77-b708-4d94-86d4-353f9abb4d32\" title=\"\">anonymously sniped</a> that members of the shadow Treasury team were to the right of the free-spending chancellor, Rishi Sunak.</p> <p>A desire to read the runes of a new leader\u2019s first moves is natural. But Labour must avoid at all costs the internal power struggles that bedevilled it during the last five years. Britain is currently experiencing the kind of event that redraws a political map already unrecognisable after Brexit; fresh thinking and analysis are required that are adequate to the times.</p> <p>When the country eventually emerges from the crisis, there will be loud calls for a gradual return to business as usual. But the pandemic has ruthlessly exposed how unsatisfactory, in many respects, the status quo ante was. The global economy is unlikely to re-emerge unscathed once Covid-19 is under control; traumatised by this experience of vulnerability, nations may place a new premium on increased self-sufficiency, particularly in areas such as medical supplies.</p> <p>Debate about what constitutes a moral economy is likely to take centre stage. In Britain, belated recognition of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/30/the-guardian-view-on-key-workers-applause-is-not-enough\" title=\"\">key workers</a>\u201d has exposed the often grotesque mismatch between the market price and the social worth of their labour. A more communal sensibility may come to temper the language of meritocracy and aspiration \u2013 the dominant political idiom in Britain since the 1980s. Even before the epidemic struck, the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/levelling-up-why-boris-johnson-cant-stop-saying-it-and-what-he-really-means-speech-politics-language\" title=\"\">levelling up</a>\u201d agenda of the Boris Johnson government signalled an awareness that liberal individualism \u2013 the prime minister\u2019s default political setting \u2013 did not speak to the core values and priorities of much of the country. What the Labour movement used to call \u201cfraternity\u201d may be coming back into fashion. The party needs to discern what that might mean in a modern setting.</p> <p>In shaping a response to changing times, Labour has rich resources to draw on from its history. It should revisit the neglected communitarian strand of its tradition, which had its beginnings in the <a href=\"https://www.historytoday.com/archive/labour-churches-and-ethical-socialism\" title=\"\">ethical socialism</a> of late 19th-century pioneers such as William Morris and was later developed by thinkers such as <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1964/07/30/the-socialism-of-r-h-tawney/\" title=\"\">RH Tawney</a>. The latter, in particular, deserves to be read again: his call for a economy in which social purpose took precedence over commercial and individual gain would find a ready audience among many of those taking to their doorsteps each Thursday evening.</p> <p>Conventional politics will not be resumed for a long time, but when a semblance of normality does return, a reckoning will take place on terrain that should play to Labour\u2019s strengths and core values. The same, of course, was said after the 2008 crash; 10 years of Conservative government and austerity followed. If Labour, and its arguments, are to be better prepared this time, the intellectual work must start now.</p>",

In truth, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/12/sir-stirling-moss-obituary\" title=\"\">Moss transcended both of these footnotes</a>. He was a driver of remarkable skill, of hard-edged determination to win allied to an uncompromising sense of sportsmanship, wit and a genuine joy in racing and life itself that was irrepressible.</p> <p>Admired and feted by his peers and respected by drivers of note who have succeeded him, he was, crucially, also hugely successful in almost any car in any discipline, an all-round talent that ensured his place among the greats of the sport.</p> <p>When put in the context of when and with whom he was competing, that the F1 title eluded him in no way detracts from a record that is still inspiring. He was runner-up on four occasions \u2013 three times to the great Juan Manuel Fangio and once to Mike Hawthorn \u2013 and third three times before a crash at Goodwood in 1962 ended his career prematurely.</p> <p>Fangio was at the peak of his powers when Moss joined him at Mercedes in 1955 and the British driver, often outspoken but always honest, insisted the Argentinian was the better driver. \u201cHe was the best Formula One driver of his day,\u201d Moss said. \u201cI knew that if I kept my eyes on him and followed his line, I would be very fast.

He beat him to become the first Briton to win the British Grand Prix, at Aintree in 1955, and although Moss said he believed his teammate had let him win, Fangio always insisted this had not been the case.</p> <p>Moss recalled later: \u201cWhen I asked him, after the race, if he\u2019d held back, he said: \u2018No, you were quite simply the better driver today.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It was Moss\u2019s preference for privateer teams over manufacturers, alongside a determination to drive for British teams whenever he could, that contributed to missing out on the F1 title. After switching to Maserati after Mercedes, he drove for Vanwall and British Racing Motors before returning to Rob Walker\u2019s team for two of his most striking victories \u2013 at Monaco and the N\u00fcrburgring in 1961. Facing down the new V6 \u201csharknose\u201d Ferrari 156, his Lotus was underpowered, but his skill on the twists and turns of Monaco made up for the deficit and he won by 3.6sec, while at the Nordschleife, his decision to take wet tyres before the race proved decisive.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/12/stirling-moss-formula-one-best-races-from-monza-to-monaco\">From Monza to Monaco: Stirling Moss's five best races</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A fierce competitor but great sportsman, Moss was scrupulously fair, as was displayed when he came closest to the title in 1958. Battling his countryman Hawthorn, the fight went to the final race of the season and his rival won by a point \u2013 a tiny margin that Hawthorn had maintained after a threat of being disqualified from the earlier Portuguese Grand Prix for reversing on the track. It had been Moss\u2019s fervent defence of his friend that ensured he kept the second place in that race that ultimately proved crucial in the championship.</p> <p>The title might yet still have been his with a drive for Ferrari lined up for 1962. Enzo Ferrari believed Moss, alongside Tazio Nuvolari, to be one of the greatest drivers of all time. He desperately wanted him to drive for the <em>Scuderia</em>.</p> <p>Sadly it was not to be, as the accident while racing for the Glover Trophy at Goodwood put Moss in a coma for a month and left him partially paralysed down his left side for six months.

With an unbridled enthusiasm to test himself Moss gained a class win at Le Mans, victories in endurance racing at Sebring and Reims-Gueux as well as wins in the RAC Tourist Trophy and the Targa Florio.</p> <p>He entered 527 races during his 14-year professional career, finished 375 of them and won 212. Indeed, he always chose the 1955 Mille Miglia as his best performance. It was one of the exceptional drives of his generation in a punishing race across 1,000km of public roads in Italy. Driving a Mercedes-Benz 300SLR he set a new record time and beat Fangio by 32min. His record still stands, with the race being outlawed as too dangerous two years later.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/12/sir-stirling-moss-obituary\">Sir Stirling Moss obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He recalled he and the navigator Denis \u201cJenks\u201d Jenkinson heading slightly unprepared for a humpback bridge. \u201cIn practice it had been flat-out, but that was only at about 80mph,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we arrived in the race, I was probably doing 170mph, and the damn thing took off. It was really frightening. All I could do was hope it would land true. We got away with it.\u201d</p> <p>As he would throughout his life he succeeded with aplomb, embracing all that came with being a driver in the 50s and 60s. In conversation with his old friend John Surtees, the motorbike and F1 world champion, in 2012, he noted: \u201cWe did not have sponsors to tell us what to do, did we John? I imagine it would be a difficult decision: \u2018Shall I go and chase that bird or talk to Vodafone?\u2019 I can\u2019t believe drivers today get the same pleasure we got.\u201d</p> <p>Moss unashamedly loved what he did, yet all the time he was fully aware of just how dangerous the day job was. His remarkable success should be measured against his very real awareness of the risks involved in achieving it. Moss never underestimated the nature of racing, especially during a period when safety was coming a long second to speed. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that I loved the sport because of the danger,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fear of having a serious accident was always there; an ever-present black shadow lurking beside me in the car.\u201d</p> <p>There was, however, no sign of him allowing it to affect him. His record will for ever attest that it was behind the wheel, where he so clearly belonged, that he should be remembered.</p>",
  "<p>Parliament rose on Wednesday 25 March. The lockdown followed and the government has made many new decisions and announcements. We are now passing a third week in which the coronavirus crisis continues \u2013 and in which there is no parliamentary scrutiny of the decisions made, barring a few online select committee evidence sessions. Then there will be a fourth week before parliament is due to reconvene on <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52260757\">21 April</a>.</p> <p>The absence of parliament gives ministers more time to deal directly with the crisis. There is still plenty of media scrutiny, but scrutiny by parliament matters. This was demonstrated after the government announced its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/17/rishi-sunak-pledges-350bn-to-tackle-coronavirus-impact\">\u00a3350bn loans package</a> to support business, on Tuesday 17 March. There was still far too little support for smaller businesses. MP Greg Clark <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2020/march/ministers-from-the-treasury-questioned-on-employment-support/\">tabled an urgent question</a> to tackle the issue on the Thursday and his call was supported from all sides of the House. On the Friday, the government announced the massive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak\">jobs furlough programme</a> and then, on 26 March, the package to secure the incomes of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/uk-government-set-to-pay-self-employed-workers-80-of-earnings\">self-employed</a> was announced.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Candour and transparency speed up the learning process, leading to better decisions and more effective action</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Proper, considered, penetrating, constructive scrutiny does really matter. This is not about hauling ministers before MPs to blame them for the problems they cannot instantly resolve. Former cabinet secretary Gus O\u2019 Donnell should be commended for his searing honesty when he recently admitted, without prompting, that he should have advised previous governments to commit far more resources to flu pandemic planning. This crisis calls for the same candour and transparency; that is what speeds up the learning process, leading to better decisions and more effective action.</p> <p>A wise committee will not be prosecuting its witnesses to find blame. If there is an atmosphere of blame, people tend to hide uncomfortable truths. Fear of blame does not just affect a few frontline ministers and officials. It can permeate whole organisations. If we want there to be openness and transparency within government departments and the NHS, then public scrutiny must foster an atmosphere of trust.</p> <p>You can see this in the way ministers react to the media. Journalists are channels for public anger and are often looking for scapegoats or an admission of failure. The strength of cross-party select committees is that they are set up for more considered and constructive scrutiny.</p> <p>These are terrible times. Ministers and departments are desperately overloaded, stressed and anxious. It was shocking to have the prime minister himself struck down by the virus. Still, I would urge this government to appear before MPs in public, rather than just in press conferences, while the House of Commons remains in recess.</p> <p>I have been pressing for ministers to appear in public before the liaison committee, the gathering of select committee chairs (which has yet to be formally constituted). These chairs are understandably anxious to carry out their collective scrutiny role. The government has proposed me as chair of this committee. I would not be worthy of that job if I did not represent those views and concerns to the government now.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/08/parliament-failing-to-keep-ministers-in-check-over-committee-delays\">Parliament 'failing to keep ministers in check over committee delays'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The public will wonder why journalists get to ask their daily questions, but this group of senior members of parliament does not.</p> <p>The government offered us a private video-conference briefing, but this could not achieve what only public scrutiny can do. I continue to press for a public session in the coming week.</p> <p>We should all understand that the government needed a breathing space over the past week, of all weeks. This coming week, a public evidence session would demonstrate clearly that our democratic institutions are continuing to function. The government can show its own confidence in its willingness to accept high-level public scrutiny from parliament. In particular, it will enhance public confidence in the continuity of the government while the prime minister is incapacitated.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Bernard Jenkin MP is nominated to be chair of the House of Commons liaison committee</p>",
  "<p>Technology firms are processing large volumes of confidential UK patient information in a data-mining operation that is part of the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak, according to documents seen by the Guardian.</p> \n<p>Palantir, the US big data firm founded by the rightwing billionaire Peter Thiel, is working with Faculty, a British artificial intelligence startup, to consolidate government databases and help ministers and officials respond to the pandemic.</p> \n<p>Data is also being used by Faculty to build predictive computer models around the Covid-19 outbreak. One NHS document suggests that, two weeks ago, Faculty considered running a computer simulation to assess the impact of a policy of \u201ctargeted herd immunity\u201d. Lawyers for Faculty said the proposed herd immunity simulation never took place.</p> \n<p>NHSX, the digital transformation arm of the National Health Service that has contracted the tech companies to help build the \u201cCovid-19 datastore\u201d, said the technology would give ministers and officials \u201creal-time information about health services, showing where demand is rising and where critical equipment needs to be deployed\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe companies involved do not control the data and are not permitted to use or share it for their own purposes,\u201d a spokesperson said. Faculty\u2019s lawyers said the firm only had access to aggregated or anonymised data via NHS systems.</p> \n<p>The government had previously said it would use Faculty and Palantir in a Covid-19 data project. But the full scope of that operation, and the sensitive nature of patient-level data being used, is revealed in the documents seen by the Guardian.</p> \n<p>One portion of the project involves giving leaders in the NHS, Cabinet Office and Downing Street a live feed of \u201caggregate\u201d statistics on hospitalisations, availability of critical care beds, ventilator orders and oxygen supplies.</p> \n<p>However, the documents also appear to show the project includes large volumes of data pertaining to individuals, including protected health information, Covid-19 test results, the contents of people\u2019s calls to the NHS health advice line 111 and clinical information about those in intensive care.</p> \n<p>While such data will be anonymised, it remains sensitive and confidential, and its use on a centralised new government database is likely to raise questions among privacy experts. A Whitehall source said they were alarmed at the \u201cunprecedented\u201d amounts of confidential health information being swept up in the project, which they said was progressing at alarming speed and with insufficient regard for privacy, ethics or data protection.</p> \n<p>The documents also suggest that:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>While anonymised, confidential 111 information in the Covid-19 datastore may include people\u2019s gender, postcode, symptoms, the mechanism through which any prescription was dispatched to them, and the precise time they ended the call.</p></li> \n <li><p>The project appears to be using a \u201cpseudo NHS number\u201d to cross-match large datasets, including a master patient index, an existing NHS resource that uses \u201csocial marketing data\u201d to segment the British population into different \u201ctypes\u201d at household level.</p></li> \n <li><p>While not a current priority, phone location data could be used in the datastore after it was \u201coffered\u201d to the government by two private companies for help with contact tracing. The NHS declined to say which companies had offered the location data or how it would be used.</p></li> \n <li><p>Faculty\u2019s proposed simulation of a policy described as \u201ctargeted herd immunity\u201d was part of an NHSX and Faculty planning document considered around 23 March, more than a week after ministers insisted the controversial policy was no longer being contemplated.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Lawyers for Faculty suggested the proposed simulation was the result of entirely internal, preliminary discussions. The planning document listed potential analysis of the impact of \u201ctargeted herd immunity (only isolate most vulnerable parts of population)\u201d alongside other possible government policies such as social distancing, school closures and household quarantines.</p> \n<p>The document was considered by senior NHS officials more than a week after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, tried to draw a line under the government\u2019s controversial flirtation with the strategy of herd immunity, which involves enough people contracting the disease to develop population\u2013level resistance.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/cumulative\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The NHS said the data in the Covid-19 datastore would remain under its control and be subject to severe restrictions under data protection legislation. \u201cStrict data protection rules apply to everyone involved in helping in this critical task,\u201d an NHSX spokesperson said.</p> \n<p>However, the Guardian was able to see confidential documents used by Palantir, Faculty and NHSX officials to plan, develop and execute the Covid-19 datastore. It is unclear who was responsible for making the documents \u2013 which did not contain NHS patient data \u2013 accessible via an unrestricted portal.</p> \n<p>The Whitehall source described the open accessibility of the documents as a \u201cshocking data breach\u201d. Palantir did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Faculty\u2019s lawyers said there had been no breach of patient or other sensitive NHS data.</p> \n<p>The involvement of private sector data scientists at the heart of the government\u2019s Covid-19 response stems in part from a Downing Street \u201csummit\u201d on 11 March attended by executives from dozens of tech firms, chaired by the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, an enthusiast of artificial intelligence and computer modelling.</p> \n<p>Faculty, which had a pre-existing contract to build an artificial intelligence lab for the NHS, took on a leading role in the data response to the pandemic. It is run by Marc Warner, whose brother, Ben, was reportedly recruited to Downing Street by Cummings after running the Conservative party\u2019s private election model.</p> \n<p>Ben Warner, who used to be a principal at his brother\u2019s AI company, is said to have worked closely with Cummings on the modelling programme used in the Vote Leave campaign to leave the European Union.

  "<p>Some of Britain\u2019s biggest insurance companies are facing legal action from small business owners who say their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-exposed-britain-insurance-industry-businesses-cover\">legitimate business interruption claims</a> have been unfairly turned down.</p> <p>Following the forced closure of thousands of businesses across the UK, insurers across the board were quick to change their policy terms in an attempt to rule out claims arising from the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>Although several large insurers including Allianz, Aviva and Axa do not provide cover, some insurers, most notably Hiscox, sold policies before Covid-19 hit the headlines, stating they will pay out when a business was forced to shut owing to a notifiable disease.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Business interruption policies typically pay up to \u00a3100,000 to cover the cost of keeping a company going if it is forced to close for reasons beyond its control. These include flood, fire, or even when a murder prevents the site from opening.</p> <p>Business owners have filed claims to Hiscox and other commercial insurers in recent days, only to be told their policies don\u2019t cover the pandemic.</p> <p>Last week, the Financial Conduct Authority told insurers to halt dividend payments to allow them to pay claims. It had already told insurers it expects them to treat customers fairly.</p> <p>A group of brokers and loss adjusters havejoined forces and will ask a barrister to examine the policies, with a view to taking legal action.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://cecclaims.co.uk/hiscox-action-group-covid19-claims\">Hiscox Action Group</a> said the firm\u2019s policies clearly state they will pay up where the interruption to the business was \u201cdue to restrictions imposed by a public authority following an occurrence of a notifiable human disease\u201d.</p> <p>Other insurers, including Eaton Gate, have similar terms and expected to face similar legal action in the coming months, the group said.</p> <p>Alan Dexter, who runs four restaurants in Glasgow, including Barsa Tapas, said two of his premises have business interruption cover provided by Hiscox but his claims were last week denied. He has been forced to put his 140 staff on furlough because of the crisis.</p> <p>Dexter said: \u201cOur broker pointed out that the cover states we can claim in the event of a notifiable disease, and, to my untrained eye, the policy appears to cover the exact circumstance I and many other business owners find themselves in. But after taking several days, Hiscox last week came back and said it would not be paying our claim. The company markets itself in its publicity material as the insurer that always pays out, but that has not been my experience.\u201d</p> <p>Roger Topping, who runs TopMark Adjusters, a Glasgow-based firm of loss adjusters and one of those behind the legal challenge, has called on the insurers to pay or for the government to step in.</p> <p>Topping said: \u201cWe have heard ministers tell insurers to pay these claims but, to my knowledge, not a single insurer has broken ranks and paid a claim. This is not just a Hiscox issue, several other companies including Eaton Gate, an insurer backed by Royal Sun Alliance, are in a similar position. It seems that the massive losses involved have caused the insurance industry to start searching for reasons not to pay.\u201d</p> <p>He called for the government and insurers to find a solution before \u201ca multitude of legal actions against insurers begin, and massive sums of money are wasted on legal fees. We need something along the lines adopted previously for claims following riots, flooding, or what we saw in Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles.\u201d</p> <p>Hiscox said: \u201cWe understand that these are incredibly difficult times for businesses affected by Covid-19. At Hiscox we strive to pay claims that are covered by the policies fairly and quickly.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, general business interruption policies across the industry, including Hiscox\u2019s, were not designed to cover these extraordinary circumstances. Like terrorism and flood, which have government-backed insurance schemes, pandemics like coronavirus are simply too large and too systemic for private insurers to cover,\u201d it added.</p> <p>Last month, the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/most-coronavirus-hit-uk-firms-not-protected-by-their-insurance-policies\"> Association of British Insurers told </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/most-coronavirus-hit-uk-firms-not-protected-by-their-insurance-policies\">parliament\u2019s business committee </a>that few companies would be protected for their losses by their insurance policies.</p>",

They come off shift exhausted and weary and come into our lovely lounge and we pamper them, in the same way that passengers in first-class lounges at airports are used to being looked after. NHS staff aren\u2019t used to being treated like that.</p> \n<p>\u201cAircrew are good with people. We know how to ask the right questions and make people feel at their ease, as that\u2019s what we do as crew. We\u2019re now doing that in the NHS rather than in planes\u201d.</p> \n<p>The crew involved in Project Wingman are opening a similar facility this week in five other hospitals \u2013 two in the capital, two in Essex and one in Kent \u2013 and have a growing number of hospitals now asking if they can have a first-class lounge created on their site too.</p> \n<p>The initiative is the brainchild of Fielding, Emma Henderson, an easyjet pilot, and <a href=\"https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-25/edition-12/meeting-high-flyer\">Prof Rob Bor</a>, a psychologist at the Royal Free hospital in London. Fielding, who usually flies an Airbus A380 to Singapore, and Henderson, whose usual routes include Europe and North Africa, run the peer support programme for pilots with their respective airlines, while Bor helps airlines look after their pilots\u2019 mental health.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Henderson says: \u201cGiven our profession the name Project Wingman is a light-hearted nod to Top Gun. But more importantly it is rooted in the idea that someone is there to support you. That\u2019s what we are offering to NHS frontline staff, as they are working hard to support those most in need.</p> \n<p>\u201cLike many others I just want to give back to the NHS at this critical time and the aim is to do what we can to support those at forefront of dealing with this health emergency. Rob came up with the idea. He could see that those working in hospitals at this time would benefit from some additional practical support.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fielding spends much of his time in the first-class lounge that has sprung up at the back of the Whittington\u2019s canteen on its first floor. Henderson, however, does most of the organisational work to recruit more aircrew as Project Wingman volunteers and roll it out to other hospitals, as the fact that she lives with a vulnerable person means she cannot put herself in a hospital setting.</p> \n<p>Initially, says Fielding, \u201cstaff want to talk about anything apart from Covid: about aeroplanes, places they\u2019ve been and would like to visit, holidays they\u2019re hoping to have, their fear of flying. We also get occasional aviation geeks and even had a doctor who wants to be a pilot.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, once a bond of trust has been created, adds the 52-year-old pilot, hospital staff often open up. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to hear stories from them about what a tough time they\u2019ve had that day, dealing with Covid patients.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s about seeing the amount of death, and the volume of sick and dying patients. With almost every ward in the [Whittington] hospital a Covid ward now, it\u2019s hard to escape. I\u2019m astonished that they all have their own strategies for switching off. The beauty of Project Wingman is that it\u2019s a little bit of escape from this grind.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6d848b204338ffe8594e4dba28440e86be35e69\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6d848b204338ffe8594e4dba28440e86be35e69/0_408_8096_4859/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Fielding with NHS staff at Whittington hospital\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Fielding with NHS staff at the Whittington hospital in London.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Maria Kane, the chief executive at North Middlesex hospital, says that her staff are finding real comfort in the presence of fellow professionals in uniform who are there to help them.</p> \n<p>\u201cRecreating a \u2018first-class lounge\u2019 experience is such a great idea.

It\u2019s a chance to raise funds for good causes, too. But it\u2019s also something of an experiment: one that could show whether video games can fill the void where live football used to be and also whether football \u2013 the kind played on grass \u2013 can engage with a generation of people who prefer their games virtual.</p> <p>\u201cYou can look at these Fifa tournaments as football coming to esports and trying to recapture the young demographic,\u201d says Adam Fitch. As editor of Esports Insider, Fitch covers the booming competitive video games industry, which now generates a billion dollars in revenue each year and whose biggest events, such as the League of Legends grand final, can attract audiences in the tens of millions.</p> <p>When it comes to competitive gaming, Fifa is something of an also-ran. \u201cIn esports we have rankings where we tier games,\u201d he says. \u201cFifa is in the third tier. There were 170,000 who watched the first La Liga tournament [which Marco Asensio won for Real Madrid] and for Fifa that\u2019s good. But the League of Legends European Championship pulls in more than that each week.\u201d</p> <p>Fifa lacks certain dynamics that make for a great esport, not least the fact the game reboots each year.

At the same time, some of those who are in priority groups are complaining they have been given no information, they said.</p> <p>The list of who to contact, which would normally take weeks to do, was compiled in 48 hours, and given the huge undertaking errors are likely to have crept in.</p> <p>Last month, the government announced it would contact 1.5 million people by 29 March to tell them that they should be \u201cshielding\u201d, which means they are most at risk to the virus and should stay indoors for 12 weeks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/uk-could-have-europes-worst-coronavirus-death-rate-says-pandemic-expert\">UK could have Europe's worst coronavirus death rate, says adviser</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dr Francesca Silman, a London GP, said: \u201cUnfortunately a number of people I know did not receive letters despite fitting in the shielding category, some only received letters in the past few days, and others have received letters even though they don\u2019t actually need to shield.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cIt is all a bit of a mess. Part of the problem was I think originally NHS England thought the GPs could do some of the searches \u2013 but this is not at all an easy task and the guidance for GPs to go ahead was retracted \u2026 Meanwhile, I think the public are unaware of this issue and likely to be following the letters they have or haven\u2019t received unless they have been proactive themselves and looked up the guidance.\u201d</p> <p>Information provided to the Guardian from a GP in Teesside, north-east England, with a practice of 8,000 patients, found that of the 10 patients who had been recipients of an organ transplant, only six had received the letters and four had been missed. A significant number of other patients on chemotherapy, immunosuppressants, with blood cancers and other severe underlying health conditions had also been missed, they reported.</p> <p>The shielded patient list is a specific subset of patients identified by the chief medical officer. To identify these patients NHS Digital took the groups identified and converted them into a set of clinical codes and searched for patients with these conditions in the routine and administrative data sets that they hold nationally. They also did a search for patients this week and added around 400,000 more the original list of 900,000 patients, using data automatically pulled from GP systems.</p> <p>NHS Digital relies on the quality of data entry by thousands of NHS staff, and so there may be some errors in the data. The list was put together in 48 hours. Specialist doctors and GPs can also add to it.</p> <p>The Royal College of GPs said if anyone thinks they should be shielded but has not been told, or identified when they do not meet the criteria, they should contact their family doctor or hospital specialist. People have also started to receive texts from the government saying that if they feel the message does not apply to them they can opt out of receiving texts.</p> <p>Dr Hugh Reeve, a GP in Cumbria, said he had been fielding requests from people who were confused as to what they should be doing after receiving messages. \u201cAs a GP I am now totally confused as to who is getting these messages \u2013 those who self-identified and were told to shield and contact their GP or those who were identified by national trawl.\u201d</p> <p>Katie Newbury, 32, from London, received a message in error. She had her spleen removed eight years ago, which puts at her risk of bacterial infections. She said she believed she was on the high risk list but not the shielding list. However, despite this she got a text from the government telling her she should stay in for 12 weeks.</p> <p>\u201cI got a text and it was disconcerting as I have been going out of the house. I have been avoiding shops but I have been going for walks \u2013 just the thought of not being able to leave my house for 12 weeks is worrying.\u201d</p> <p>She said she called her GP to confirm whether the advice was accurate and they said she could still go out for walks. \u201cIt did make me worry as I was wondering if there was something more they had discovered about people without spleens than initially.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe doctor said they would check the guidance while on the phone and said it was all right and I could still go outside the house. I saw other people on social media had similar issues.\u201d</p> <p>The Royal College of GPs also said that the guidance for identifying which vulnerable patients become shielded is still unclear, and they are raising this issue with the governments and health leaders across the UK.</p> <p>Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: \u201cThere is still some uncertainty over the guidance for identifying which vulnerable patients become shielded, and we are raising this with the governments and health leaders across the UK.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>\u201cThere is no eerier sight,\u201d my fellow comedy critic Bruce Dessau <a href=\"https://www.beyondthejoke.co.uk/content/8587/richard-herring-chat-show\">wrote this week</a>, \u201cthan a comedian performing to silence.\u201d He was referring to Friday\u2019s no-audience version of Graham Norton\u2019s chat show, but the words apply equally to my Saturday night\u2019s entertainment, watching Anna Mann\u2019s Cheese, Sex and Self-Isolation Party live-streaming on <a href=\"https://nextupcomedy.com/\">the standup platform NextUpComedy</a>. I already knew NextUp as an online home for fine standup specials from acts who are below the radar of, say, Netflix. On Saturday night, I turned to its bespoke live stream to help with the withdrawal symptoms I\u2019m experiencing as a man whose Saturdays are usually spent up close and personal with live comedy.</p> <p>The host is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/11/colin-hoult-funniest-things\">Colin Hoult\u2019s luvvie alter ego Anna Mann</a>, spinning superannuated theatrical anecdotes to a webcam. The format consists of an unvarying close-up on Hoult\u2019s face, a houseplant in the background, and our hostess wittering on \u2013 to silence, of course. It\u2019s like a Skype chat crossed with a charity telethon: Hoult is obliged to make repeated requests for \u201ctips\u201d from his viewers. It\u2019s good news, of course, that NextUp is generating its own content and that 50% of the revenue is shared with comedians \u2013 particularly now there is little work for comics elsewhere. But for the first 20 minutes, this is less than riveting viewing. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just me doing this for an hour and a half,\u201d says Anna at one point. \u201cAlthough it is mainly that\u2026\u201d</p> <p>My first thought was that this is a show for those who, even by lockdown-era standards, have a lot of time on their hands. Hoult is a funny man who stays in his funny alter ego character, unfazed, across a (too) wide span of airtime. But comedically, Mann\u2019s part-improvised, part-scripted (I assume) monologue is low-wattage, as she recounts stealing sandwiches from Frances de la Tour and a contretemps with Ian McKellen. Alongside that, there is much to-and-fro with commenters below the line, whose input seldom elevates the amount of wit on display.</p> <p>As well as the money-making imperative, this audience interaction is presumably there to defray Dessau\u2019s deafening silence: if you can\u2019t hear them laugh, at least \u2013 by talking with them \u2013 you can remind yourself, and anyone looking on, that there <em>is</em> an audience there. But I was relieved when Mann finally introduced her first of three guests, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/apr/25/christopher-bliss-rob-carter-comedy\">Rob Carter\u2019s spoof novelist Christopher Bliss</a>. Webcamming from his home, Bliss reads us a ghost story excerpt and an erotic vignette, each delivered with his trademark mix of self-delight and inelegant prose.</p> <p>The energy spikes. Carter \u2013 and the later guests, <a href=\"https://peteheat.co.uk/\">magician </a><a href=\"https://peteheat.co.uk/\">Pete Heat</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/27/olga-koch-review-russia-father-edinburgh\">comic Olga Koch</a> \u2013 have seemingly made the policy decision to bring with them their own portion of good cheer. Carter is pert and playful. Heat, \u201cMargar-easter\u201d cocktail in hand, is all tipsy smiles (\u201cBlinken nora,\u201d run the comments, \u201cmagic man\u2019s off his tree!\u201d). Koch laughs uproariously \u2013 and endearingly \u2013 from the beginning of her section to the end.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t laugh quite as much myself: Koch was trying some new material that involved excavating a drawer in her house full of ex-relationship keepsakes. It was a strong idea (below the line: \u201cthis is turning into an Edinburgh show\u201d) but underdeveloped, and evidently more thrilling to its creator than the audience. Pete Heat\u2019s magic was more effective, even if gremlins, or Hoult\u2019s tech confusion, diminished one set-piece flourish. But the guests brought variety and dynamism to a format that felt claustrophobic and, yes, eerily quiet without them. There are the makings here of a sparky online variety show, but judging by this week\u2019s edition, it\u2019s not there yet.</p>",
  "<p>Drug treatment experts have raised concerns a drop in the supply of illicit drugs to the UK triggered by the lockdown is leading to an increase in the number of users turning to more dangerous alternatives.</p> <p>A reduction in global travel, increased border restrictions and a slowdown in movement within the UK has resulted in a drop in the supply of illicit drugs, including heroin and the designer drug spice.</p> <p>The Guardian understands that border guards have noted a recent drop in seizures as traffic into the country subsides, while senior police sources have noted the dip in supply.</p> <p>But experts have warned that fewer drugs on the streets is not as positive as it sounds, as users are already turning to high-strength alternatives such benzodiazepines, while there is a significant risk of heroin users substituting with fentanyl, a lethal drug 50 to 100 times stronger than heroin.</p> <p>The number of drug-related deaths is at a record high, according to the most recent official estimates, driven by deaths linked to drug misuse.</p> <p>The reduced supply is also leading to an increase in the price of some substances, including cannabis, and decreasing the purity of others as dealers cut them with different chemicals to increase bulk, experts have told the Guardian.</p> <p>Dr Rachel Britton, the director of pharmacy at the drug, alcohol and mental health charity We Are With You, which runs 80 drug treatment services across England and Scotland, said: \u201cWe are receiving reports that the coronavirus is affecting the supply of illicit drugs.</p> <p>\u201cWhile less drugs on the street may seem like a good thing, what replaces them is usually more dangerous. We know the purity of many drugs is decreasing as dealers cut them with different substances to increase their bulk. This means people often don\u2019t know what they are taking, increasing the chance of overdose.</p> <p>\u201cWe are also hearing reports that to make up for shortages in drugs such as heroin and spice, a large amount of high-strength benzodiazepines have entered the market, which are a lot more potent than normal diazepam.\u201d</p> <p>A key concern is that users of heroin may turn to the powerful opioid drug fentanyl as an alternative. There have already been reports of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/03/fentanyl-deaths-on-the-rise-drug-added-to-heroin-report\">rise in deaths in the UK caused by the drug</a> prior to the pandemic.

This drug has been linked to the overdose crisis in the US and Canada, but so far the UK has largely been spared.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, even with the absence of fentanyl, the UK already has record levels of drug deaths. If fentanyl or any of its analogues were to start to appear this would be catastrophic.\u201d</p> <p>Ian Hamilton, senior lecturer in addiction and mental health at the University of York, said: \u201cThe problem with fentanyl is it has wreaked havoc in North America because it\u2019s estimated to be between 50 to 100 times stronger than heroin.</p> <p>\u201cPre-Covid we\u2019ve not had anything like the problems North America has had but the consensus is that it\u2019s only a matter of time \u2013 and Covid could be the crisis that triggers that.\u201d</p> <p>In the UK, most heroin comes from Afghanistan and while some fentanyl has been produced and supplied from China in the past, that is no longer the case.</p> <p>\u201cThe added problem with fentanyl is that we\u2019re no longer reliant on China because it can be domestically produced,\u201d Hamilton added.</p> <p>Lawrence Gibbons, National Crime Agency (NCA) drugs threat lead, said: \u201cDuring the unprecedented situation the UK is facing, the NCA remains committed to relentlessly pursuing organised crime groups who present the most significant threat to the UK, including those trafficking drugs.</p> <p>\u201cOur work in the illicit drugs space remains a high priority and we\u2019re aware that criminals may adapt to changing circumstances. We are monitoring intelligence and working with partners to ensure that we, and the whole law enforcement system, are alert to any increase, decline or indeed changes in drug supply chains and can respond swiftly.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cUK law enforcement including Border Force are working to prevent drug trafficking into the UK and to disrupt drugs supply within the UK.

  "<p>In the early 1970s, futurologists began to reimagine the relationship between home and workplace. A new wave of technological innovation seemed to be pushing together the private and public worlds that the Industrial Revolution had rent apart.</p> <p>Networked computers installed in an employee\u2019s home would revolutionise the modern corporation.

Is telework an idea whose time has finally come?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In facilitating non-standard employment, the rise of teleworking played its part in fostering our gig economy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Looking to the past can help us to answer this question. Back in the 1970s and 1980s, there were plenty of reasons to be excited about the possibilities of telework. Some analysts hoped that less commuting would reduce western capitalism\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels. Others foresaw a revitalisation of local neighbourhoods, with dormitory suburbs transformed into thriving communities of home-workers. Teleworking seemed to hold the key to equality for women with young children, who could hold on to hard-won careers thanks to more flexible regimes of home-based employment. One early adopter was the software company F International, organised on a remote-working model from the outset. Its founder, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2017/mar/08/dame-stephanie-shirley-flexible-remote-working-glass-ceiling\">Stephanie \u201cSteve\u201d Shirley</a>, seized the opportunity to recruit highly skilled female programmers whose careers had stalled following marriage and motherhood.</p> <p>Yet there were also reasons to be sceptical. Trade unionists feared that telework was just another ploy by employers to cut wage bills and erode workers\u2019 rights. Some firms recruited teleworkers as self-employed contractors, thus shirking responsibility for pensions, sick pay and maternity leave, as well as neatly sidestepping health and safety laws. In the early 1980s, the office supplies company Rank Xerox restructured its UK operations by engaging former employees as \u201cindependent\u201d subcontractors who undertook to do a substantial amount of work for the company and to buy its equipment. Other firms offered loans to teleworkers for the purchase of computers, thus ensuring that their self-employment status could not be called into question. In facilitating the spread of these forms of non-standard employment, the rise of teleworking played its part in fostering our present-day <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/29/gig-economy-traps-workers-in-precarious-existence-says-report\">gig economy</a>.</p> <p>Yet despite these cost-cutting advantages for companies, many managers were resistant to remote working and adopted it with extreme caution. A congregated workforce could be directly monitored, incentivised and disciplined, but supervising at distance posed new challenges. For teleworkers, continuous surveillance was swapped for carefully negotiated \u201cdeliverables\u201d and payment by results, while only those deemed to have the right \u201cpersonality\u201d were extended the privilege of working from home. In 1990, a senior civil servant compiled a formidable list of necessary attributes for prospective teleworkers in his department. They included: \u201cself-motivation and discipline; the ability to work without direct supervision; the ability to cope with minimal social contact and be self-reliant \u2026 the ability to cope with any additional stress from dealing with work at the same time as domestic responsibilities.\u201d</p> <p>Few were able to tick all the boxes. One professional writer, previously an enthusiast for home-working, described his struggle to maintain boundaries amid the everyday noise and chatter of family life: \u201cHow do you explain to a two-year-old that Daddy in the kitchen making a cup of coffee is thinking about his next paragraph and is not to be interrupted?\u201d Women, by contrast, tended to accept these domestic conflicts as the price they paid for clinging on to the threads of a career. Female teleworkers were less likely to have a dedicated workspace or a spouse on hand to keep children at bay, and generally received lower salaries than their office-bound peers. As the campaigner and expert Ursula Huws archly put it, men felt the absence of \u201cthe masculinity-confirming buddy-world of the workplace\u201d. But for women without reliable childcare, it was often a choice between inferior pay and conditions as a teleworker or not working at all.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/mar/25/extreme-loneliness-or-the-perfect-balance-how-to-work-from-home-and-stay-healthy\">Extreme loneliness or the perfect balance? How to work from home and stay healthy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Much of this history will resonate with frazzled parents currently housebound with children under the coronavirus lockdown. Business gurus originally sold teleworking as a lifestyle choice, conjuring images of \u201celectronic cottages\u201d insulated from dreary commutes and constricting office routines. The reality of remote home-working, however, was \u2013 and remains still \u2013 more complicated.</p> <p>The Covid-19 crisis is helping to shine a light on both the pleasures and pressures of having the home as your office. Jumping from a Zoom meeting to a lazy game with the kids in the garden might seem like a template for the good life, but home-working does not exist apart from wider social and economic equalities. Achieving job security, control at work and time for a life outside of it is as pressing a problem today as it was for pioneer teleworkers in the late-20th century.

This alone would cut 1.8bn tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, which would otherwise have contributed to the global climate crisis this year, according to Rystad.</p> <p>The analysts also expected a slump in electricity use and heavy industry to drive demand for gas and coal down by about 2.3% each, erasing carbon emissions from each fossil fuel by 200mtonnes and 500m tonnes respectively.</p> <p>Erik Holm Reiso, a senior partner at Rystad, said: \u201cThe coronavirus pandemic is an unprecedented event for energy markets, which will have a substantial impact on the world\u2019s total carbon emissions.</p> <p>\u201cThe last time demand for oil contracted, during the financial crisis in 2008 to 2009, demand fell by 1.3m barrels of oil a day. But Covid-19 could cause oil demand to fall by more than five times as much.\u201d</p> <p>The unprecedented drop in oil demand will emerge in large part due the global aviation industry, he said. Typically there are about 99,700 commercial flights per day but the crackdown on non-essential travel to curb the spread of the virus could see air traffic fall by an average of almost a quarter over the year.</p> <p>Fewer cars on the road <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/03/uk-road-travel-falls-to-1955-levels-as-covid-19-lockdown-takes-hold-coronavirus-traffic\">will also dent demand for petrol and diesel</a> by an average of 9.4% over the year, shrinking oil demand in 2020 by an average of 2.6m barrels of oil a day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The analysts say the use of transport fuels may start recovering in the second half of the year, but found demand would lag the figures recorded last year.</p> <p>Energy demand in China, the world\u2019s biggest importer of oil, is expected to begin recovering next month, four months after the outbreak in the Wuhan province. However it will not make a full return to normal levels until September at the earliest, according to Rystad. This could stoke a slow rise in global energy demand in the second half of 2020 but a recovery to 2019 levels is not forecast for this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Resio said: \u201cThe real question is over the long-term impact of the virus. If we learn that remote working can work people may begin to question whether we need to take long haul flights to meet people in person.

  "<p>My friend Annie Marchant, who has died aged 68 of pneumonia, was a dealer in, and collector of, Victorian kitchen and dairy antiques. She amassed a huge collection of items, and her pieces were often used on film and television sets.</p> <p>To enter the kitchen of Annie\u2019s farmhouse home in Wingham, Kent, was to move into an older, timeless world; a better world, indeed, of scrubbed pine, old kitchen equipment glinting in the candlelight, a hunting dog, cats curled up on every surface, vegetables from the garden waiting to be cooked and a newborn lamb being warmed beside the Aga. There was no intrusion from the modern world, no electricity, no radio playing, just the tick of the clock, the kettle singing on the hob. It was delightful.</p> <p>Annie was born and raised in that farmhouse in Wingham, and she lived there for most of her life. She was the only child of John Marchant, a hop farmer, and his wife, Betty (nee Macarthur).</p> <p>She went to Battle Abbey school in Battle, East Sussex, and after a period working on a kibbutz in Israel \u2013 something that made her a passionate supporter of Palestinian causes \u2013 she trained to be a fashion buyer for Peter Robinson on Oxford Street in London. Eventually, in the late 1970s, she became involved with an antiques shop called Chattels in Camden Market in north London. After that she set up on her own in 1980, selling antiques mainly in Covent Garden and Olympia.</p> <p>Annie\u2019s speciality was Victorian \u201ckitchenalia\u201d (a term she hated) - the machines, pots, pans and utensils that were used in the kitchen and dairy during Victorian times. Among those who hired items from her collection was the comedian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/apr/20/victoria-wood-obituary\">Victoria Wood</a>, for the set of her soap opera parody Acorn Antiques, which was a weekly slot in her sketch shows during the mid-80s and was later turned into a musical.</p> <p>Annie was a lively, talkative and strong-minded woman who held <br>unshakeable views about almost everything \u2013 the best word I can think of to<br>describe her thought processes was that everything should be \u201cproper\u201d \u2013 it was, she believed, proper to be frugal, proper to reuse and recycle, proper to grow your own vegetables, proper to preserve produce at harvest time, proper to look after wounded animals.</p> <p>She had no immediate family, but entertained a huge circle of friends and was accepting of everybody, whatever their background or proclivity. She hated injustice and was sympathetic to anyone she felt had been oppressed by the political system.<br><br>Annie moved back into the family home when her parents died in 1990 and thereafter she used it to showcase her collection of old things. She had a great eye for beauty and effortless style \u2013 everything around her looked gorgeous, and she was its beautiful centre. </p>",
  "<p>When behavioural scientist Dr Pragya Agarwal moved from Delhi to York more than 20 years ago, her first priority was to blend in. As a single parent, a woman of colour and an academic, she worked hard to \u201cwater down\u201d the things that made her different from those around her. Yet the more she tried to fit in, the more Agarwal began to ask herself why humans appear programmed to create \u201cin groups\u201d and distrust those on the outside.</p> <p>\u201cUnconscious bias has become a buzzword in recent years,\u201d explains Agarwal. \u201cWe are all biased and, though some biases can be harmless, many aren\u2019t.\u201d These are the issues she unravels in her book <em>Sway: Unravelling Unconscious Bias</em>, and she confronts some uncomfortable truths along the way.</p> <p>Agarwal argues that humans aren\u2019t naturally rational creatures, and with our brains constantly bombarded with information, we rely on cognitive short cuts: patterns of learned thinking based on what has worked for us in the past, the messages we receive from others and our evolutionary programming. \u201cCognitive short cuts evolved to help us survive,\u201d she says. \u201cThe problem is that we still have these responses and they don\u2019t work well in the modern world.\u201d</p> <p>In our tribal past, the consequences of wrongly assuming that an outsider was peaceful or free from disease could be so damaging that being overcautious became a human evolutionary strategy. The result is the tendency to generalise: speedily assigning those around us to groups based on race, academic status, social class or gender and ignoring details that contradict our existing beliefs. Once we\u2019ve placed a person in a box, Agarwal suggests we are more inclined to choose the dehumanising and dangerous approach of treating them according to the stereotypes we associate with that box rather than as an individual. It\u2019s an experience the author has had herself.</p> <p>\u201cAbout 18 months ago my daughter wasn\u2019t well,\u201d she says. \u201cI could feel something was terribly wrong, but medical staff thought I was over-reacting.\u201d After creating a \u201cscene\u201d and insisting her child was admitted to hospital, the toddler went into septic shock.</p> <p>With research showing that women are less likely to be taken seriously by health professionals and that people from minority ethnic communities face prejudice within healthcare systems, Agarwal believes the dismissive way she was treated was unconscious bias in action. In <em>Sway</em> she gives wide-ranging examples of other groups who face negative consequences of bias, from professional Asian footballers who struggle to be taken seriously to female musicians who are less likely to gain orchestral positions if their gender is known.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are all biased. Biases can be harmless, or not</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Agarwal\u2019s motivation is personal as well as academic. As the eldest of three sisters growing up in India, she was very aware of gender bias. \u201cBefore my youngest sister was born, everybody hoped the baby would be a boy. A third daughter was seen as a huge burden and the hospital staff were disappointed for my parents and were shocked when my father celebrated her birth anyway.\u201d</p> <p>Despite or because of this inequality, Agarwal grew up conscious of women\u2019s rights. Her upbringing wasn\u2019t entirely conventional: her parents never prepared their daughters for marriage and they didn\u2019t learn to cook or do domestic chores. \u201cThey let us spread our wings in a world that was not designed for women.\u201d Nevertheless her parents worried about Agarwal\u2019s outspoken behaviour in public as a young girl, concerned she might \u201cbe attacked or raped\u201d because of the way she would speak up for others \u2013 even to adult men.</p> <p>Though she describes them as feeling \u201cconflicted\u201d about whether to insist their daughters conformed to some social norms, Agarwal\u2019s parents invested heavily in the siblings\u2019 financial independence and insisted each pursue professional career paths to ensure they never needed to rely on a man for money.</p> <p>Now a parent to her own three daughters, Agarwal has become determined to go further and help create a fairer world for her children. \u201cWe can go some way to controlling explicit prejudice,\u201d she explains, pointing to laws against hate crime and speech and a growing awareness of explicit racism, sexism and homophobia. Yet it\u2019s the subtle and subversive ways that bias creeps into society that worry Agarwal the most.</p> <p>\u201cDigital voice assistants are often narrated by women,\u201d she says. This flows from and then reinforces stereotypes around the subservient role of women. Facial recognition software is, studies have shown, inherently racist and as technology learns from ongoing interactions, bias is reinforced in a feedback loop. \u201cWe can\u2019t see technology as a panacea,\u201d she insists. \u201cThere is a systemic and structural problem. The data being used is biased and a lack of diversity in teams means that technology hasn\u2019t considered all our diverse parameters.\u201d</p> <p>Bias also plays out in times when we feel more afraid, threatened and stressed, she observes. Even if we don\u2019t believe a stereotype, she says, we can still internalise it. When these stereotypes are spread in words and images they become contagious and reinforced by the wider subconscious as biases. \u201cIt is an extraordinary time,\u201d she reflects. \u201cThe idea of an \u2018in group\u2019 and an \u2018out group\u2019 has always existed, but it is being heightened by the way it is used politically, with advertising and political campaigns relying on our desire to belong to a group and our fear of anything outside it.\u201d She points out that with the world locked down, our echo chambers are likely to be more influential than ever.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Calling Covid-19 a \u2018Chinese virus\u2019 led to acts of racism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Agarwal is not entirely pessimistic, but she is realistic. \u201cIn times of crisis our biases are strengthened,\u201d she insists, pointing to how quickly President Trump labelled Covid-19 a \u201cChinese virus\u201d. She sets out how the \u201chorn effect\u201d (a type of cognitive bias that taints our entire view of a person or community based on one negative aspect) allowed this comment to spread with the vigour of the virus itself, prompting direct acts of racism against Asian communities.</p> <p>At least, she argues, we are finally in a place to have an honest conversation about bias. \u201cThe walls we have been putting up recently are not conducive to a harmonious society and though, through history, liberal views have always come under threat, that doesn\u2019t mean people aren\u2019t listening.\u201d Agarwal feels certain that the challenge we are now facing will shine a light on the inequalities in our societies and she hopes that a small silver lining of this international emergency will be its role as a catalyst for long-term change. \u201cIf we protect the most marginalised people in society right now, it could have positive consequences for the entire population. Learning that lesson today could alter the way we tackle injustice.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>In the meantime,</strong></em> Agarwal encourages us to consider our own privilege; acknowledge and actively notice our own biases, particularly if we are parents or role models for young people. \u201cNobody wants to think that they are biased, but we all are and once we start acknowledging that we can do something about it.\u201d She suggests that we take stock of whether our friends look, sound and are from the same background as us and that we \u201cstep outside our comfort zones and connect with others who aren\u2019t like us.\u201d</p> <p>Though bias is often unconscious, she believes we all need to proactively educate ourselves. \u201cJust saying that something is unconscious doesn\u2019t absolve us of responsibility. We must think about why we have these learned behaviours and where the messages come from,\u201d she says. And in this usually frenetic world she encourages us to take time to activate the rational side of our brains when making important decisions, as snap judgments tend to rely on our implicit biases.</p> <p>She cites one study that shows how when nurses were asked to imagine how much pain a patient was in, they overcame bias and prescribed adequate pain relief. Developing empathy for others is, she says, the main way we are going to counteract these biases. \u201cBy placing ourselves in another context we shift our viewpoint. We can\u2019t do this without putting ourselves in someone else\u2019s shoes.\u201d Surely there has never been a better time to do so.</p> <p><em>Sway: Unravelling Unconscious Bias by Pragya Agarwal </em><em>(Bloomsbury Sigma,</em><em> </em><em>\u00a316.99) is available for \u00a314.27 at <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/sway-9781472971357.html\">guardianbookshop.com</a></em></p>",

In Portugal, tens of thousands of migrants and asylum seekers have been \u201cregularised\u201d and given full rights. It\u2019s not quite a revolution, but it\u2019s an epic conceptual awakening.</p> <p>I live in Parma, but despite the profound anguish here in Italy, it also feels, paradoxically, as if the world has come right in some way. With our despoiling suddenly stopped, wildlife is returning with innocent ebullience. Bottlenose dolphins have been playfully leaping in the <a href=\"Bottlenose%20dolphins%20have%20been%20playfully%20leaping%20in%20the%20waters%20around%20Venice\">waters around Venice</a>. The canals are so crystalline that swans, and shoals of fish, have returned. Hares graze undisturbed in parks in Milan. Deer have been strolling the golf courses of Sardinia and paddling along sandy beaches. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/picture/2013/oct/01/1\">Mallards are bathing</a> in Piazza di Spagna and birds have been nesting in the crooks of closed-up, disused wing-mirrors.</p> <p>In some ways it\u2019s like a blissed-out stoner\u2019s dream of what the world might be. The \u201cPianura Padana\u201d, the flat plain of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/picture/2013/oct/01/1\">Po valley</a>, usually has some of the worst air pollution in the world. The air is now perfumed by spring. You can see the mountains. Two weeks ago we were singing Rino Gaetano\u2019s The Sky Is Evermore Blue from our balconies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"612e806230b6cdb8d7a7ef932c5d4cac9320986c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/612e806230b6cdb8d7a7ef932c5d4cac9320986c/0_141_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Grand Canal, Venice, empty of traffic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Grand Canal, Venice, empty of traffic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Silvestri/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Realists have, rightly, tempered the utopian excitement and warned of a bleak future. Outbreaks of localised barbarism and criminality are predictable when people feel impoverished, paranoid and vulnerable. Already, in Italy, we\u2019ve had instances of toughs refusing to pay in supermarkets. Democratic politicians have had a taste of almost dictatorial power over the people, and it will be hard to roll back rule by emergency decrees. Countries like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/hungarian-journalists-fear-coronavirus-law-may-be-used-to-jail-them\">Hungary</a> might be slipping away from the democratic fraternity. Public health will be an excuse to ramp up state surveillance and, when we need to jump-start the economy, environmental protections may well be ripped up. The counter-revolution, those seers say, is just around the corner.</p> <p>But despite all these fantasies, one of the consequences of the crisis is that we\u2019re suddenly more serious about the truth. \u201cAccurate scientific, economic, political and social information about what is happening somewhere,\u201d <a href=\"Bill%20Foster,%20a%20history%20lecturer%20at%20Homerton%20College,%20Cambridge\">Bill Foster</a>, a history lecturer at Homerton College, Cambridge, told me last week, \u201cis suddenly valuable everywhere. It\u2019s literally a matter of life and death. We might just be tempted now to remember what we lost when we started to abandon trying to find truths together.\u201d It\u2019s intriguing that it\u2019s taken this pandemic, rather than sensitive referendums and elections, to persuade social media companies of the need to <a href=\"Bill%20Foster,%20a%20history%20lecturer%20at%20Homerton%20College,%20Cambridge\">combat fake news</a> and conspiracy theories.</p> <p>Without truth there is no trust, and the gates of civilisation are wide open to political blackguards and devious disinformation. Those gates have been open for decades, and it\u2019s one of the hard-to-swallow lessons of this contagion that gate-keeping is paramount, that we need boundaries and membranes. Having managed a therapeutic community for almost a decade, I\u2019ve always known that blocking, or expelling, damaging elements was vital to communal wellbeing (you can\u2019t, for example, have drug use in a rehab). I knew that monastic wisdom depended on enclosure. But I still instinctively baulked at any impediment to free movement on a global level. We internationalists inevitably struggle to accept the idea. And yet the very first principle of a functioning group (as enunciated by Nobel prize-winning political economist, <a href=\"Nobel%20Prize-winning%20political%20economist,%20Elinor%20Ostrom\">Elinor </a><a href=\"Nobel%20Prize-winning%20political%20economist,%20Elinor%20Ostrom\">Ostrom</a>) is \u201ceffective exclusion of external, unentitled parties\u201d.</p> <p>The penny has also dropped that wellbeing isn\u2019t individual but social. We are not actually independent at all, but dependent. We can make each other sick and we can try to make each other well. We\u2019ve understood that a healthy community (as Wendell Berry wrote in his essay <a href=\"https://scienceandsociety.duke.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Berry-Health-is-Membership.pdf\">Health Is Membership</a>) isn\u2019t merely human, but also \u201cits soil, its water, its air\u201d.</p> <p>It has been fascinating to see the speed at which other attitudes have changed. The indignation expressed towards people not respecting <a href=\"https://scienceandsociety.duke.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Berry-Health-is-Membership.pdf\">social distancing</a> (from those who would never normally describe themselves as moralists) has been understandably shrill: here too we\u2019ve suddenly realised that the wellbeing of the group is endangered by indifferent individuals, and that community \u2013 for which we\u2019ve yearned for so long \u2013 means originally simply a pooling of duties.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ba36caf01032dfedadb4284a7c06c27095a8af8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ba36caf01032dfedadb4284a7c06c27095a8af8/0_187_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man with a bouquet in San Fiorano, Italy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 16th day of quarantine in San Fiorano, one of the 11 small towns in northern Italy that has been on lockdown since February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marzio Toniolo/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/18/need-roots-disconnection-past-community\">The Need for Roots</a></em>, her manifesto for how to refound society after the second world war, the philosopher and activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/feb/03/religion-simone-weil\">Simone Weil</a> wrote that \u201cthe notion of obligations comes before that of rights\u201d. It\u2019s a complicated, but convincing case, and it seems to me that in the last month there has been a radical shift in the balance between rights and responsibilities that has changed the timbre of our lives. I\u2019ve never seen so many news items about <a href=\"the%20notion%20of%20obligations%20comes%20before%20that%20of%20rights\">applause</a>, or so many social media posts accompanied by clappy emojis.

We manufactured grievances that now can be seen for what they were.\u201d Now, when people meet their obligations to us we\u2019re obliged. Gratitude replaces knee-jerk annoyance.</p> <p>The lockdown has made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-has-exposed-a-desperate-need-for-localism\">everything local</a>. The world has got much larger and we\u2019re rediscovering corner shops and neighbours, the wisdom of proximity and closeness. The great Italian communalist Lanza del Vasto once urged: \u201cFind the shortest, simplest way between the earth, the hands, and the mouth.\u201d That shortening of the supply chain has rehumanised us slightly. We\u2019re bartering with strangers on our street and sales of yeast and flour have increased exponentially as we rediscover the consolations of baking.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve come to an emergency stop. We're not just separated from others but we can no longer separate from ourselves</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I have a high-powered lawyer friend who has described the joy of just darning socks and knitting. It sounds folksy, I know, but the kitchen table is the centre of our lives once more. We\u2019re rediscovering that frugality and resourcefulness are creative, if not always comfortable. Last week I was cutting the communal grass of our palazzo \u2013 the only place our kids can play outside \u2013 with a borrowed billhook, which is a bit like cutting hair with a fork.</p> <p>That centring has been mental as well as physical. It\u2019s a truism of modern life that we struggle to be settled or present. Because we can be anywhere, we actually end up being nowhere. We suffer, as the sociologist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/jan/15/zygmunt-bauman-obituary\">Zygmunt Bauman</a> once wrote, an<strong> \u201c</strong>electronically assured out-of-placeness\u201d. We\u2019re notoriously fidgety and lacking attention. We just keep clicking and tapping. When I was running our community, one of the hardest things for those in early recovery was just to sit still. We used to have Quaker-like silences twice a day, and to begin with, many just couldn\u2019t cope with the sudden stillness.</p> <p>It seems to me as if we\u2019re all in a similar situation right now. We\u2019ve come to an emergency stop, and it\u2019s painful not just because we\u2019re separated from others, but because we can no longer separate from ourselves. Until now we\u2019ve kept frenetically busy to keep from reflection, but now that we\u2019re still, demons, voices and shame can quickly surface. I know friends who are suffering panic attacks, even something close to psychosis. Many are alone and far from the solace of any fellowship.</p> <p>The poet and psychologist Hala Alyan wrote a <a href=\"https://emergencemagazine.org/story/this-is-not-a-rehearsal/\">beautiful essay</a> in <em>Emergence</em> magazine last week, in which she suggested that this pandemic is \u201cserving as a flashlight \u2013 illuminating people\u2019s unsteadiest, half-finished parts. It\u2019s showing us where our work remains. People talk about their ex-boyfriends, their long-resolved eating disorders, their childhood secrets\u2026\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c69c7fb4a2bde0187e3684175851e605ab3e8a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c69c7fb4a2bde0187e3684175851e605ab3e8a7/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A daughter paints her father's toenails while her mother looks out of a balcony\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Schoolteacher Marzio Toniolo, 35, has been documenting life under lockdown in San Fiorano since February.

The Dutch theologian Henri Nouwen once described <a href=\"wounds%20and%20pains%20become%20openings%20or%20occasions%20for%20a%20new%20vision\">a healing community</a> as a place not where \u201cwounds are cured and pains are alleviated\u201d, but where \u201cwounds and pains become openings or occasions for a new vision\u201d. I don\u2019t delight in the pain, but I am glad we\u2019re being honest about it.</p> <p>It may be that this medical emergency will offer the space and time for us to focus, for once, on our interior worlds. Because any speculation about the future is redundant unless there is spiritual, as well as medical, healing. Johnny Sertin, founder of a soul-centred consultancy called Becoming, said last week: \u201cWe need another way, another world, but it\u2019s impossible if we cannot do that from a place of being at home with who we are.\u201d</p> <p>As we\u2019re all pondering self-preservation, it\u2019s inevitable that we\u2019re wondering what has been eating us up all this time. Many of the friends I\u2019ve talked to in recent weeks have expressed relief that there\u2019s an enforced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/social-distancing-tips-the-rules-of-safe-shopping-under-coronavirus\">detox from shopping</a>. Many seem to have realised the true nature of consumerism, which is that we\u2019re not only consumers but also being consumed by it. Choice is so limitless that we never make up our minds. All the energy, movement and money to buy stuff and experiences leaves us feeling empty and remorseful. I personally know that every time we drive to the out-of-town shopping mall, built (allegedly) on the proceeds of organised crime, with speakers in the car park blasting the very worst pop music, to buy cheap clobber for the kids \u2013 it rips my spirit.</p> <p>As long ago as 1955, Victor Lebow suggested that we seek \u201c<a href=\"https://sustainablesociety.com/social/consumerism#.XoxVEFNKi9Y\">spiritual satisfaction</a>\u201d in consumption. Acquisition pretends to fill an existential void but only deepens it. We\u2019re constantly engaging in a psychic gorging and purging that leaves us weak and guilty. It\u2019s only during this slow-down that I realise how similar we are to Leonia, the imaginary society described by Italo Calvino in <em>Invisible Cities</em>: \u201cexpelling, discarding, cleansing a recurrent impurity. Street cleaners are welcomed like angels\u201d.</p> <p>It feels as if this crisis is allowing us to glimpse the back office of society, not just those street cleaners, but also the detritus we\u2019re sprinkling every day online. Perhaps it\u2019s because notions of <a href=\"expelling,%20discarding,%20cleansing%20a%20recurrent%20impurity.%20Street%20cleaners%20are%20welcomed%20like%20angels\">personal protection</a> are now at the forefront of our minds, or because talk of biometric monitoring and state surveillance are now being explicitly discussed\u2026 but I feel as if we\u2019ve finally awoken to the truth about the information age: that it\u2019s we who are being informed upon. In an attempt to understand this pandemic, many of us are fixated with statistics, graphs and clusters. But we\u2019re also constantly giving ourselves away. That jittery clicking comes at a cost. As that old adage goes: \u201cWhen something online is free, you\u2019re not the customer, you\u2019re the product.\u201d</p> <p>It seems even more important now, because almost the last distraction now left to us is the internet. All our social rituals \u2013 in pubs, clubs, schools, religious gatherings \u2013 are currently mediated by screens. There\u2019s still idealism in our digital connections, as evidenced by the open-source community\u2019s collaboration on the design or production of medical equipment. But our online habits are being constantly monetised. Writing about surveillance capitalism last week, Simona Guerra, an associate professor of politics at the University of Leicester, said that, just like manual labour of old, \u201chuman activities themselves are sold and bought\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f41c164bd787f13616a56806c69e38df49fa9431\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f41c164bd787f13616a56806c69e38df49fa9431/0_27_3189_1913/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The deserted Gallery Vittorio Emanuele II, Milan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The deserted Gallery Vittorio Emanuele II, Milan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicola Marfisi/AGF/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Because of this crisis we\u2019ve also begun to question the greatest absolutism of the last half-century: the supremacy of the market. It\u2019s become clear, as <a href=\"human%20activities%20themselves%20are%20sold%20and%20bought\">Rowan Williams</a> said to me, that \u201cthe so-called \u2018market state\u2019 is lethally ill-equipped to cope with large-scale collective crisis\u201d. The minimum wages of essential workers, the failure of supply and demand for medical equipment and the sheer cruelty of comments suggesting that the vulnerable could be sacrificed to keep the economy going \u2013 all have revealed the pickpocketing of the market\u2019s \u201chidden hand\u201d and the steepness of its \u201clevel playing field\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s as if the sacred \u201cmarket\u201d has, like a hated dictator, finally been toppled. Instead of our society having a market, we\u2019re realising that the market had our society. Jonathan Rowson, the philosopher and director of the Perspectiva research institute, wrote recently that \u201cthe state\u201d, instead of \u201csocialising and humanising the economy\u201d, had allowed \u201cmarkets to gradually economise and dehumanise society\u201d. Even the <em>Financial Times</em> has been advocating Keynesian, collectivist financial packages. We\u2019re rehabilitating those heretics who have long lamented neo-liberalism\u2019s corrosive effects. The great social theorist Steven Lukes is blunt: \u201cmarket fundamentalism\u201d, he told me, has created \u201cdevastation and unbridled inequalities\u201d.</p> <p>Globalisation has been a large part of the market\u2019s supremacy. The idealistic telling of globalisation was that it was an equitable trading free-for-all which could enrich the poor. The reality, though, has been incessant outsourcing so that our consumables remain as cheap as chips. We\u2019ve come to expect all produce, at all times, in all seasons. Globalisation has been a race to the bottom, which has created semi-slavery at the harsh end of very long supply chains. It has eradicated businesses and jobs close to home and shred local networks of trust and kinship. Like the globe-trotting money, we\u2019ve become frenetically mobile and rootless.</p> <p>But the most naked truth of this crisis is that we can no longer remain in denial about finitude, not just our own as we see mortality close up, but also our planet\u2019s. The Quaker economist Kenneth E Boulding once (allegedly) said: \u201cAnyone who believes in infinite growth on a finite planet is either mad or an economist.\u201d It\u2019s so obvious it\u2019s been ignored for decades. But if this Covid crisis is a dress rehearsal for the climate one, we have seen some of the costs and consequences. \u201cThe case for post-growth economics,\u201d Rowson says, \u201cjust became stronger. We need economies that make sense of 8 billion or so human beings living together in a planetary system as a whole, not the extraction of profit to achieve abstract aggregate targets like GDP.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s long been one of the truisms of modern life that we suffer mythic deprivation. We tell stories, but are never enveloped in one. There has been no belonging and thus no community, no heroes and no quests. Suddenly we have all the above. But it\u2019s not entirely like a film where the heroes would be the medics dying to save us (125 in Italyat the time of writing) and the quest would be the global race to find a vaccine. They\u2019re just a part of this story. Heroism for the rest of us is much subtler and quieter: it\u2019s about restraint and retreat, solitude and stillness. And our quest is perhaps even harder: to discern the common good and look for enlightenment in this darkness.</p> <p><em>Tobias Jones </em><em>is the author of A Place of Refuge</em></p>",

Days before, Trump had used the signing statement for the law to blunt two newly created IG posts, suggesting he would decide what information Congress receives about the aid package.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s sudden oustings of the two well-respected watchdogs, Michael Atkinson, the IG for the intelligence community, and Glenn Fine, the acting IG for the Pentagon, sparked special concerns given their timing and apparent political motivations.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s ousting of Fine, who was recently picked by his fellow IGs to run a critical oversight panel for the $2.2tn law, is seen as a broad slap at any oversight on the president and his administration since it rendered Fine ineligible to lead the watchdog panel.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s motives in firing Atkinson prompted other worries. After initially saying he had simply lost confidence in Atkinson, Trump used a pandemic press briefing the next day to unleash an angry torrent at Atkinson\u2019s handling of the whistleblower complaint, slamming him as not \u201ca big Trump fan\u201d.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s antipathy to IG watchdogs was displayed again at a pandemic briefing last week when he was asked about a report by the health and human services IG revealing that hospitals faced \u201cwidespread\u201d shortages of face masks, and \u201csevere\u201d test shortages.</p> <p>Providing no evidence, Trump dismissed the report as \u201cjust wrong\u201d, and the next day labeled it \u201canother fake dossier\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06b7f8acf731ab75671a37e1764ec48afa299e3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06b7f8acf731ab75671a37e1764ec48afa299e3e/0_126_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"At a recent press briefing Trump unleashed an angry torrent at Atkinson\u2019s handling of the whistleblower complaint.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At a recent press briefing Trump unleashed an angry torrent at Atkinson\u2019s handling of the whistleblower complaint.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Wong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>IGs were created in 1978 to ferret out executive agency waste, fraud and abuse.

  "<p>A storm is brewing. But this particular Tempest, from site-responsive specialists <a href=\"https://www.creationtheatre.co.uk/whats-on/the-virtual-tempest/\">Creation Theatre</a>, is something special. Connected by the now ubiquitous video conferencing app <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/zoom\">Zoom</a>, an online audience is helping to bring Shakespeare\u2019s brooding play to life. Commanded by Prospero\u2019s spirit Ariel, we rattle our screens, click our fingers and generally make some noise. We\u2019re creating live theatre together and it feels a little bit like magic.</p> <p>The show\u2019s starting point is an immersive production of The Tempest that director Zoe Seaton staged in Oxford last summer, and some ingenious tweaks have been made to accommodate the new online setting. The actors perform in front of green screens, which are filled with a vast array of backdrops. Sometimes the scenery is downright silly (giant fish float past during the opening storm); sometimes it\u2019s symbolic (Prospero stands in front of endless TV screens); and sometimes the company perform in front of tantalising fragments from Ryan Dawson Laight\u2019s original set.</p> <p>For a production pulled together in just two weeks, there are impressively few technical glitches. The sound occasionally drops out, or the \u201cwrong\u201d piece of action might be highlighted, but overall this is a confident production lit up by a great sense of mischief. Miranda and Ferdinand fall in love during a clever split-screen trick, Trinculo swigs wine from a magically disappearing bottle, and Simon Spencer-Hyde\u2019s Prospero commands the action from a TV control centre, where he can change the backdrop with a simple flick of the switch.</p> <p>The play has been drastically abridged but the actors, many returning to roles they played last year, lend their speeches real clarity. The online setting feels like a naturally confined context, and it\u2019s the entrapped characters \u2013 including Itxaso Moreno\u2019s Ariel and PK Taylor\u2019s Caliban \u2013 that are most memorable. But it\u2019s the audience who are the most excited and exciting characters of all. During what sometimes feels like a Shakespeare-themed episode of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/gogglebox\">Gogglebox</a>, spectators flash up on the screen whenever they get involved in the action. It\u2019s such a joy to enjoy the show together. And that feeling of clapping together, while apart, at the end of the show?

  "<p>Gavin Newsom this week declared himself the leader of a \u201cnation-state\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaddowBlog/status/1247698364063518720\">Speaking on MSNBC</a>, the California governor on Tuesday announced his state would be amassing more than 200m medical-grade masks per month for health workers on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic. After weeks of competing with other states for critical medical equipment, in the absence of strategy and coordination from the federal government, Newsom said he had had enough. So he harnessed the bulk purchasing power of \u201cthe state of California as a nation-state\u201d to spend nearly $1bn to work with non-profits and manufacturers to deliver masks for his constituents, and possibly other states.</p> <p>The next morning, as <a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article241860561.html\">#PresidentNewsom trended</a> on Twitter, Newsom once again presented the state he leads as a global power. \u201cWe need to coordinate and organize our nation-state status,\u201d he told reporters at his daily Covid-19 press briefing. California \u201chas been a catalyst to increase supply that will not only avail itself to the state of California but more broadly across this country and potentially in other parts of the globe\u201d, he added.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/why-california-waiting-test-results-backlog-quest-diagnostics\">Why is California still waiting for nearly 60,000 coronavirus test results?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the leader of the nation\u2019s most populous state \u2013 which, Newsom often likes to point out, would have the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy, if it were a sovereign nation \u2013 the governor has often cast himself as a foil to Donald Trump. As the president and the governor bickered, critics in California have lamented that the governor often promised more than he could deliver, and was at times counterproductive by trying to appease too many groups at once. But amid the federal government\u2019s faltering response to the coronavirus crisis, Newsom is getting both local and national recognition for stepping into a leadership vacuum.</p> <p>After identifying its first cases of Covid-19 in late February, California became the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/13/california-coronavirus-response-schools-disneyland\">first US state to issue</a> a widespread stay-at-home order on 19 March. Since then, the state has seen more than 20,000 coronavirus cases and 570 deaths \u2013 but the death toll appears to be rising more slowly than in hard-hit New York and New Jersey. Public health experts have credited the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-31/coronavirus-social-distancing-west-coast-california-new-york-covid\">state\u2019s foresight</a> in enforcing social distancing. The Trump administration\u2019s response meanwhile, has lagged behind, with the president denying the crisis and delaying action even as the national death toll climbed.</p> <p>Newsom moved into the governor\u2019s mansion in 2018, replacing Jerry Brown \u2013 a prominent figure who had dominated California politics since the 1970s. At 52, he has already had a long career in politics and weathered a fair share of scandal. More than 15 years ago, as San Francisco mayor, he made headlines after he defied national law to marry same-sex couples in California. He made national headlines again in 2007 after it was revealed he had an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/02/us/02newsom.html\">affair with a subordinate</a>, who was also the wife of his chief campaign adviser. At the time, Newsom was separated from Kimberly Guilfoyle \u2013 now an adviser to the president, and the partner of his son Donald Trump Jr.</p> <p>Newsom has tried to cast himself as a young, fresh and progressive leader \u2013 whose Silicon Valley-chic contrasts with Brown\u2019s suits and ties. He has also presented himself as the governor of \u201cthe most un-Trump state in America\u201d \u2013 loudly challenging the Trump administration\u2019s policies on the environment, immigration, healthcare and gun rights \u2013 often on the president\u2019s favorite platform: Twitter. Trump, meanwhile, has relished taunting Newsom as an \u201cincompetent governor\u201d, and obsessing over narrow policies that disproportionately affect California.</p> <p>But amid the coronavirus crisis, rather than fighting the president, Newsom has opted to show him up, in some cases delivering on the president\u2019s empty promises. As Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000007026448/trump-coronavirus.html\">blithely reassured</a>, \u201cJust stay calm. It will go away,\u201d Newsom earned praise from public health experts around the country for enforcing strict, early distancing orders. While Trump beat back pleas from governors to send more of the ventilators needed to treat coronavirus patients, Newsom shipped <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/newsletter/ca-feds-500-ventilators-national-stockpile-new-york/\">500 ventilators</a> to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom/status/1247655661120315393\">seven states</a>. And when the federal government sent <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-29/california-broken-ventilators-silicon-valley-newsom\">faulty equipment</a>, Newsom harnessed the state\u2019s outsized tech industry to quickly fix them.</p> <p>As the federal government stepped back from the crisis, governors including Newsom, Andrew Cuomo in New York and Jay Inslee in Washington found a national audience of Americans looking for steady administration amid chaos.</p> <p>Governors across the country have stepped up, said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic political strategist who has worked for former president Bill Clinton and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>People look for heroes in times of crisis.

This is all in the spirit of all of us stepping into this moment and doing what we can.\u201d</p> <p>While Cuomo\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK23nfdEVDk\">open, emotional briefings</a> have captivated national broadcasters, Newsom\u2019s shewed, steady strategy through the crisis could pay off, said Amanda Renteria, who was the national political director for the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2016 and a primary challenger to Newsom in 2018. Newsom made \u201ca big statement\u201d when he made California the first US state to order all residents to stay home, Renteria told the Guardian. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be an after-review of how those actions made a difference,\u201d she noted.</p> <p>Already, public health officials are praising Newsom\u2019s early action. Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, has repeatedly held up California as a success story to highlight the effectiveness of distancing measures to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d. Even Donald Trump, who has singled out other Democratic governors as targets during his daily coronavirus briefings, has lauded Newsom. \u201cGavin Newsom has been terrific,\u201d the president <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-13/\">said at a 28 March</a><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-13/\"> briefing</a>. A few days later, Trump again admitted, \u201cThey\u2019ve done a good job, California.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot help but be impressed by his response,\u201d said Bill Whalen, a media consultant for California politicians including the ex-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, \u201cI\u2019m not by nature a great fan of his agenda.\u201d</p> <p>Newsom\u2019s political career going forward will hinge on how well he\u2019s able to sustain the momentum, as Californians continue to weather the pandemic. Already, the same criticisms of his lack of focus and boundless ambition are starting to catch up to him.</p> <p>His dramatic announcement on national television that he had secured hundreds of millions of medical masks, left many <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-09/gavin-newsom-coronavirus-masks-purchase-california-legislature\">state lawmakers confused</a>, without clarity on the total amount being spent, and without having seen the details of the contracts signed by the administration. And some of the groups that Newsom had apparently included in his deal were blindsided by his announcement.</p> <p>\u201cThe governor has apparently done something extraordinary by making arrangements we were not privy to,\u201d Thomas Tighe, CEO of the California-based not-for-profit Direct Relief, told <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/newsletter/newsom-trump-cuomo-masks-ventilators-supply/\">Calmatters</a>. \u201cBut we\u2019re delighted.\u201d</p> <p>And while California has not seen the surge in coronavirus cases that have overwhelmed cities like New York and Detroit in the past weeks, Newsom has admitted that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/01/california-coronavirus-shelter-in-place-flatten-curve\">delays and huge backlo</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/01/california-coronavirus-shelter-in-place-flatten-curve\">gs</a> in coronavirus testing have left Californians with an unclear image of how, exactly, the disease is spreading through the state. The governor said he \u201cowns\u201d the issues with testing, and has developed a taskforce to correct course.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s rare that elected leaders get real-time feedback on how well they led,\u201d Renteria noted. \u201cBut now people are getting to know their leaders, and paying attention to what they do in that moment of truth.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 15 April 2020 because California issued a stay-at-home order on 19 March, not on 10 March as an earlier version said.

  "<p><strong>\ufeff</strong>In my years as a dance music critic I\u2019ve analysed the finer points of house and techno, but always felt lost when it came to Bach and Mozart. The compositions sound overstuffed to my ear, long symphonies test my patience and, inevitably, the music slips into the background, making me feel like I\u2019m living in a period drama.</p> <p> The repetitive structures of contemporary composers like Philip Glass and Steve Reich make sense to a techno-head, but pure classical has remained frustratingly out of my grasp.</p> <p>This year is the 250th anniversary of Beethoven\u2019s birth, andcelebrations \u2013 all now sadly on hold \u2013were planned around the world. As I I\u2019ve got plenty of free time during lockdown, I decide to give Ludwig another shot, starting with his Symphony No 5 in C minor, possibly the most famous piece of classical music ever written \u2013 but my eyes glaze over after the dramatic da-da-da-DAH intro.</p> <p>Luckily, the internet offers plenty of help. The online Khan Academy has a video <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/music/music-masterpieces-old-new/ludwig-van-beethoven-music/v/ludwig-van-beethoven-symphony-no-5-an-appreciation-by-leon-botstein\">series</a> on this very symphony, with a wildly enthusiastic conductor telling how when this music debuted it sounded innovative, even daring. The bombast of Beethoven would have been as thrilling as a Marvel fight scene to 19th-century Vienna. But even imagining this I still can\u2019t find the piece \u201cmind-shattering\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f1726b0bd9ff338e1aa27dd955c598486d055924\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1726b0bd9ff338e1aa27dd955c598486d055924/402_0_5213_3130/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Lausanne Chamber Orchestra performing pieces by Beethoven, Schubert and Mozart behind closed doors on March 4.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Lausanne Chamber Orchestra performing pieces by Beethoven, Schubert and Mozart behind closed doors on March 4.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/music/music-masterpieces-old-new/ludwig-van-beethoven-music/v/ludwig-van-beethoven-part-1\">lesson</a> breaks it down musically, highlighting a moment where the strings drop away to leave a single, plaintive oboe, before erupting back into action. It reminds me of how electronic dance music uses the dynamics of gentle breakdowns and explosive drops for maximum drama. So Beethoven had killer drops, too?</p> <p>The pandemic has sent the world\u2019s orchestras into hibernation. I find a touching virtual <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eXT60rbBVk\">performance</a> of Beethoven\u2019s Ode to Joy by the Rotterdam Philharmonic, each player contributing from self-isolation. Hearing those strings soar, apart but together, I feel a genuine tingle.</p> <p>I\u2019m ready for the real thing. There are many options for virtual Beethoven concerts, including performances from <a href=\"https://oxfordphil.com/concert-performance/stream-the-opo-performance-of-beethoven-s-symphony-no-1\">Oxford</a> and <a href=\"https://www.digitalconcerthall.com/concert/52428/?a=youtube&amp;c=true\">Berlin</a>. I choose the Philadelphia Orchestra, who filmed themselves <a href=\"https://www.philorch.org/performances/special-performances/virtual-philadelphia-orchestra/virtual-philadelphia-orchestra-watch/\">performing</a> to an empty auditorium when their 12 March show was cancelled.</p> <p>The lessons have made a difference. I can identify instruments and follow melodies, so feel more engaged. But I still get distracted. Beethoven, the Khan Academy teacher said, needs your undivided attention. So I put everything else aside, stand up, and Beethoven\u2019s emotional volatility suddenly surges through me. I do it the way I first fell in love with techno \u2014 checking nobody\u2019s there to see, I dance.</p>",

The previous year, her father had been taken from the family\u2019s home in Fels\u00f6g\u00f6d, Hungary; she never saw him again. Her mother had been gassed at Auschwitz.</p> <p>The girl was sent to work as a slave labourer in an armaments factory near the Polish border. From there, she was marched to Bergen-Belsen. \u201cIt was an endless journey across frozen fields,\u201d recalls Susan Pollack, as she is now called. \u201cWe could barely move, but those who could not walk were shot.\u201d</p> <p>At Bergen-Belsen \u201cconditions were indescribable.

  "<p>How are your dreams these days? If they\u2019re unusually vivid and bizarre, you\u2019re not alone. Your housemates might not be interested in the content, but that\u2019s OK, the internet is, with social media and online forums awash with people outlining in detail their \u201c<a href=\"https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/lifestyle/article/lockdown-dreams\">lockdown dreams</a>\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/think-about-the-best-case-scenario-how-to-manage-coronavirus-anxiety\">'Think about the best-case scenario': how to manage coronavirus anxiety</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some of these are clearly symbolic of our current daytime fears \u2013 difficulty breathing, trying to scrub bugs off our bodies, being trapped. But the virus and its consequences don\u2019t always take centre stage. Some people\u2019s dreams have entirely different distressing themes; others are finding that they are simply dreaming more, and that the dreams are more fantastical. It\u2019s a strange irony that as our waking hours become more monotonous, our nighttime lives seem more varied.</p> <p>Scientifically, what makes our dreams more or less graphic is essentially mysterious. Research suggests that the more in tune we are with our feelings during our waking hours, the more colourful (literally) and memorable are our dreams. Medications that tinker with adrenaline and noradrenaline \u2013 two neurotransmitters that mediate our levels of arousal and our response to stress \u2013 can have dramatic effects on dreams. Many patients taking beta blockers, which interfere with these neurotransmitters, notice intense new dreams or nightmares. Other drugs that interfere with noradrenaline are used, along with therapy, to treat severe nightmares.</p> <p>Under lockdown we have fewer opportunities to use our normal coping strategies. Are the anxieties of our collective subconscious creeping out for unfettered play at night? A more prosaic factor may be the disruption of our usual routines. It\u2019s probably not too controversial to say that we might be finding time for a little more morning rumination during the lockdown (before, ahem, leaping out of bed to work a productive eight-hour day from home).</p> <p>Disrupted or altered sleep is commonly reported after any kind of stress, from perceived social slights to natural disasters. And we don\u2019t have to be directly affected by events for them to start weighing on our subconscious. In 1986, the Nasa Challenger<em> </em>space shuttle exploded in footage that was widely viewed. Interviews several weeks later showed that even among children living on the west coast of the US, in the wrong timezone to have seen the accident live, and without local personal connections, <a href=\"https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/ajp.156.10.1536\">a quarter</a><a href=\"https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/ajp.156.10.1536\"> experienced</a> repeated shuttle-related dreams. Reassuringly, 14 months after the explosion, these dreams, and other anxiety symptoms, had substantially reduced.</p> <p>To be clear, this is a different phenomenon from the chronic nightmares of post-traumatic stress disorder. The puzzle here is why so many of us are having such realistic and memorable dreams as this crisis develops.</p> <p>Scientists have tried to capture how national trauma affects sleep quality. During the first Gulf war, in 1991, nighttime missile attacks on Israel came with little warning. Sleeping was dangerous. Unsurprisingly, telephone surveys found high rates of reported sleep problems. But when researchers followed up by actually <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1757247\">recording sleep</a>, they couldn\u2019t find evidence of decreased sleep quality during the conflict. The immediate effects of stress on sleep seem to be subtle, not easily captured by monitoring our brain waves or nighttime movement.</p> <p>What you remember on waking is a faded facsimile of the dreams you had. Dreams, particularly vivid dreams, usually happen during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. It\u2019s a ghoulish sleep stage we shift in and out of during the night. In terms of the brain\u2019s electrical activity, it has a lot in common with being awake. If you are purposely woken during REM sleep \u2013 a favoured trick of sleep science laboratories \u2013 you are more likely to recall your dreams.</p> <p>We are still in the early stages of understanding sleep, and we know even less about the science of dreams. They are as slippery to study as they are for us to understand individually, sneaking off as we wake. We think that dreams help us to cope with stress and process emotion, but this is a tricky idea to test scientifically: we don\u2019t have a method to manipulate our dreams without affecting other aspects of sleep.</p> <p>When something is difficult to study in humans, neuroscientists often turn to animals. You can\u2019t ask a rat whether it dreams of electric sheep, but you can record how much REM sleep it\u2019s getting. Rat studies show that the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/33/5/621/2454542&amp;sa=D&amp;source=hangouts&amp;ust=1586518739187000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH5Ej0WadFVHuO1kHzmudvADUQFkA\">effects of stress on REM sleep</a> depend on the amygdala \u2013 a small structure buried deep in the brain that directs the emotional response to our external world. The amygdala is packed with receptors for stress hormones.</p> <p>What really gets our stress system going are situations that feel unpredictable and uncontrollable. And it\u2019s loss of control that might be important for our dreams, too. In mice, short bursts of escapable stress led to increased duration of REM sleep; if the stress was of the same intensity, but inescapable, REM sleep was decreased.</p> <p>Coronavirus is causing financial hardship, social isolation, loss of our normal roles, and, for some, loss of loved ones. These stresses are real and present, others are feared or existential. Uncertainty and unpredictability dominate our experience. So far so normal, in the sweep of human history. What\u2019s different about the current crisis is the additional stress of social distancing.</p> <p>Our bizarre dreams are the tip of the psychological iceberg. We are now, like it or not, taking part in a giant experiment into the effects of increased stress in tandem with dramatically reduced social contact. This is an opportunity to learn about how we respond to this dual assault, what factors affect how this impacts different people, and what helps us through. Stress and social isolation were problems before coronavirus bared its spikes \u2013 this crisis could transform our knowledge of how to help those who may still face social isolation when the lockdown lifts. Research efforts are under way. For example, the public can take part in the King\u2019s College <a href=\"https://rampstudy.co.uk/\">Repeated Assessment of Mental Health in Pandemics</a> study.</p> <p>As for these vivid lockdown dreams, for most of us they will pass.

pharmacies, supermarkets, petrol stations, bakeries, laundromats, dry cleaners, newsagents, bottle shops, IT repair and car repair, vet services, pet food stores, and banks. </p> \n  <p>Kmart and

  "<p>\u2018We will not at this stage be checking the items in baskets and trolleys to see whether it is a legitimate necessary item,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j07oLkDYQPo&amp;amp;t=3m16s\">Nick Adderley</a>, chief constable of Northamptonshire, warned last week, \u201cbut if people do not heed the warnings, we will start to do that.\u201d</p> <p>There was a time (just a month ago, in fact) when \u201cpolicing your diet\u201d meant little more than government ads about five a day or Jamie Oliver sounding off about \u201cjunk food mums\u201d. Now we are threatened with an actual police officer standing at the checkout rummaging through our trolley.</p> <p>One should be wary about being drawn into a moral panic over a moral panic \u2013 that, just as the actions of a few people flouting lockdown regulations are turned into a national crusade against rulebreakers, so the comments of a few over-officious police officers come to be taken as the norm. There is no law, even in these surreal times, which sanctions the police to make moral judgments on your shopping. Adderley\u2019s comments were <a href=\"https://talkradio.co.uk/news/priti-patel-lockdown-not-about-heavy-handed-law-enforcement-20040933193\">shot down</a> by the home secretary, Priti Patel, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NorthantsPolice/status/1248238009360793601\">withdrawn</a> by the force.</p> <p>The chief constable\u2019s remarks follow, nevertheless, a pattern of police forces beginning to see themselves not merely as guardians of the law, but also as our moral guardians, from using drones to shame walkers in a deserted national park to defining what is an essential journey. And the question this raises is not just about the boundaries of intrusive policing in the midst of a pandemic, but also about how we might expect to be policed in the post-pandemic world.</p> <p>There is beginning to be talk about what may be the government\u2019s exit strategy from the lockdown \u2013 how and when will we return to a normal state of affairs? The answer depends partly on what we mean by \u201cnormal\u201d. And when it comes to policing, we may well be faced with a \u201cnew normal\u201d.</p> <p>A year ago, China\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/08/business/china-surveillance-technology.html\">social credit score system</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/08/16/data-leviathan-chinas-burgeoning-surveillance-state\">mass surveillance programme</a> were viewed in the west as \u201cOrwellian\u201d. Now they are seen as providing essential tools in the fight against coronavirus.</p> <p>Mass surveillance has allowed the Chinese authorities to track the movements of suspected coronavirus carriers and to identify with whom they have come into contact. As the lockdown is eased in cities such as Wuhan, phone apps have been introduced that classify everyone with a colour code \u2014 red, yellow or green \u2014 that indicates contagion risk and determines <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/business/china-coronavirus-surveillance.html\">who can travel</a> or access public space.</p> <p>Other countries have begun to adopt <a href=\"https://www.top10vpn.com/news/surveillance/covid-19-digital-rights-tracker/\">similar techniques</a>. South Korea has been lauded for its mass testing programme. But that programme rests upon an <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-south-koreas-success-in-controlling-disease-is-due-to-its-acceptance-of-surveillance-134068\">intrusive tracking system</a>, using a combination of phone location data, CCTV footage and credit card records to trace people\u2019s movements.</p> <p>The EU has the strictest privacy laws in the world. That hasn\u2019t stopped the European commission from asking telecoms companies to hand over data to allow governments to <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/coroanvirus-covid19-surveillance-data/\">track population movements</a>. In Britain, the NHS is developing an app that traces close contacts of people carrying the coronavirus and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/31/nhs-developing-app-to-trace-close-contacts-of-coronavirus-carriers\">advises them</a> to self-isolate. It may also be used to provide <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/nhs-coronavirus-tracking-app\">\u201cimmunity passports\u201d</a> to those deemed no longer to be at risk. The system will be voluntary, but <a href=\"https://medium.com/@rachelcoldicutt/open-letter-contract-tracking-and-nhsx-e503325b2703\">raises many questions</a> about ethics and personal liberties.</p> <p>These are not normal times and there is a good case for more intrusive policing and surveillance measures to stem a pandemic. But temporary responses to specific emergencies have a habit of becoming permanent, especially, as historian <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19d90308-6858-11ea-a3c9-1fe6fedcca75\">Yuval Noah Harari observes</a>, \u201cthere is always a new emergency lurking on the horizon\u201d. We only have to look at how 9/11 generated a host of surveillance policies that have since become the new normal.</p> <p>Governments and private companies have long used phone data to track individuals, but the practice has always been contested. The ease with which data sharing has occurred in the pandemic might signal a shift in perceptions. Similarly, the willingness of politicians to make public the private medical details of individuals, from South Korea\u2019s online listing of infected individuals to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/technology/coronavirus-surveillance-tracking-privacy.html\">New York mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s tweet</a> about an individual who had contracted Covid-19, with sufficient information to allow the press <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/03/03/nyc-lawyer-with-coronavirus-in-severe-condition-health-department/\">to out him</a>, suggests the crossing of a previous red line.</p> <p>All this takes place as the relationship between society and the state is being reshaped. From the economic measures announced by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to offset the impact of the lockdown to talk of a new \u201csocial contract\u201d, there are the beginnings of a debate on the changing role of the state in the post-pandemic world. There is much here to welcome, from the recognition accorded to low-paid workers to the possibility of a more robust welfare state. But with a more expansive state, especially against the background of a weaker labour movement and a more quiescent civil society, is likely also to come increased surveillance and more intrusive policing, for our own good, of course.</p> <p>There will be no police officer inspecting your grocery basket, but there will undoubtedly be increased digital snooping. Local authorities and police forces already use data mining techniques to classify individuals and to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/21/technology-has-tempted-us-to-walk-willingly-into-a-modern-panopticon\">predict future outcomes</a> on everything from which child might be in danger to where a crime might occur. Such techniques will only become more entrenched in the post-pandemic world.</p> <p>China has demonstrated how to utilise digital technology to enforce social control. Liberal democracies are adapting those techniques for their own purposes. It may turn a public health emergency into a public order issue, but it won\u2019t stop the next pandemic. A properly thought-out and funded health service and social care system, widespread testing and decent statutory sick pay will do more to mitigate its impact. But it will make liberal democracies less liberal, less democratic, more monitored, more policed.</p> <p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",

In that one word, delivered with Freeman\u2019s usual deadpan finesse, we are gifted an insight into a loving couple striving, with a shared wit and worldview, against filthy circumstance. Two against nature, indeed, whether it\u2019s school or bumptious parents or heart-scream tragedy or, as it often is, their own bloody children, too-tender Luke and too-bubbly Ava. Writers Simon Blackwell, Chris Addison and Freeman himself have given us not only a couple we can honestly believe in but also a drama for modern times; not sure, in fact, whether it should even qualify as \u201ccomedy\u201d, though \u201cdramedy\u201d sounds like being force-fed a sour-bourbon medicine. Yet dramatic indeed: I can still feel in my bones that <em>crump</em> that vaulted Michael high over an anonymous suburban street.

To say it\u2019s a science fiction series utterly belies its drip-slow gifts. No whooshy rockets or whizzbang alienettes; just a steady, low-booming, ethereal sense of unease, unsteadiness, crossed somehow with memories, none of which any of us have, of Soviet-era satellite braincamps where young scientists were bred and raised as something thrummed underground.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htuNZp82Ck\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1htuNZp82Ck?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htuNZp82Ck&amp;feature=emb_title\">Watch a trailer for Tales from the Loop.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s art might best be described as haughty steampunk.

  "<p>A year on from the Easter bombs that killed more than 250 people, Sri Lanka is now under pandemic lockdown and facing rising pressure.</p> <p>President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, whose decision to include individuals accused of atrocities during the country\u2019s 25-year civil war among his political appointments has been a source of international opprobrium, is now under fire over the country\u2019s repressive, militarised response to Covid-19.</p> <p>With tensions increasing, and parliament and courts <a href=\"https://www.cpalanka.org/structures-to-deal-with-covid-19-in-sri-lanka-a-brief-comment-on-the-presidential-task-force/\">suspended</a>, a civil society that had been working hard to rebuild trust and harmony from the ground up is struggling.</p> <p>It was 21 April 2019 when three large bombs targeting Christians and tourists were triggered.</p> <p>Hasaru Jayakody was at mass in Negombo, where 115 people would die, including his mother Priyanthi whom he describes as \u201cthe best person I ever met\u201d. Badly injured, he spent his 17th birthday in hospital.</p> <p>A statue of Jesus, spattered with blood, has been preserved in a clear box as a poignant reminder for the people of Negombo, who over the past year have been working to come through the trauma together.</p> <p>The physical environment has been rebuilt.

In the immediate aftermath, some Muslim businesses were boycotted by Sinhala or Buddhist customers \u2013 until leaders came together through local inter-religious committees, reinforcing messages of harmony and emphasising the right of all to live and work in Negombo.</p> <p>When refugees faced physical attacks after the bombings, human rights activists like Ruki Fernando<em> </em>stepped in to protect them.</p> <p>\u201cIn the context of large numbers of dead, injured and the magnitude of the tragedy, refugees didn\u2019t receive much attention and support from the government, media, religious leaders and overall, Sri Lankan society. But some politicians and government officials were sympathetic and mindful of their duties,\u201d he says, remembering how the Negombo police station sheltered a large number of refugees at the height of unrest, despite being overstretched.</p> <p>Harassment of Muslims had happened before, but the problem increased after the attacks.

She directed the original stage production of <em>Fleabag</em>, script-edited the TV version and is currently the National Theatre\u2019s playwright in residence. Jones has written and created new HBO series <em>Run</em>, DryWrite\u2019s first TV production, which debuts this week on Sky, starring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/domhnall-gleeson\">Domhn</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/domhnall-gleeson\">all Gleeson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/16/unbelievable-quiet-power-netflix-drama\">Merritt Wever</a>.</p> <p><strong>How did the idea for </strong><em><strong>Run</strong></em><strong> come about?<br></strong>Me and Phoebe had a joke years ago where we\u2019d whisper \u201cRun!\u201d to each other in any situation we wanted to get out of. A relationship, a social engagement, the wrong job, wrong decision\u2026 The idea being that we\u2019d take each other\u2019s hands, make a dash for it and keep going. It was a comforting feeling that there was always someone who\u2019d run away with us. We never did it, never just ran off and left people hanging \u2013 except once at a festival, but that\u2019s another story! Mostly it was just a funny idea. Years later, it morphed into this TV show.</p> <p><strong>The series opens with a long-separated couple texting \u201cRun!\u201d to each other. Did you ever unwisely text your exes?<br></strong>I used to. I\u2019d also stalk them on social media and obsess about the tiniest things. Are they wearing that jumper I bought them? Bastard!</p> <p><strong>Merritt Wever\u2019s character, Ruby, is a suburban housewife who leaves her life behind. Why?<br></strong>I wanted to explore the idea of a woman at the end of her tether. Yes, she\u2019s middle-class, and in many ways she has nothing to complain about, but Ruby feels like she\u2019s not seen, even by herself. She\u2019s an intelligent woman with loads of potential, but she\u2019s ignored herself and given up so much. This is the only way Ruby can think of to change her life and she does it in a split-second. It\u2019s an extreme solution to what\u2019s perhaps a common problem.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9gnW8TAP2U\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x9gnW8TAP2U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9gnW8TAP2U\">Watch a trailer for Run.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Domhnall Gleeson\u2019s character, Billy, is a motivational speaker.

There was no real voice or leadership where feminism was concerned. In fact, lots of our friends were distancing themselves from the notions of feminism that we\u2019d grown up with. The messages that young girls were getting through porn were confusing. Where were we supposed to look for inspiration?

  "<p>A quick sift through the offers on a price comparison app and it is easy to see which websites have what appear to be the cheapest deals on electronics and other goods. Many of the best offers come from abroad, particularly Asia, and the savings look generous.</p> <p>Take the newly launched Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus. Originally on sale for \u00a3160, they cost as little as \u00a3105.99 from eGlobal Central, \u00a3126.30 at MyTrendyPhone and \u00a3129.90 from Alternate when the <em>Observer </em>checked.</p> <p>But how genuine are these deals and how wary should consumers be of sites like these?</p> <p>Some experts believe there are ways to take advantage of discount sites, while minimising the risk of getting stung. \u201cReviews are essential and often include photos from previous buyers which gives you an insight into the quality of the product,\u201d says James Allum, of digital payments platform Payoneer. \u201cWith careful research, people will find a great range of quality products at an amazingly low price.\u201d</p> <p>However, the web is littered with fake reviews. Search for the zero or one-star ones and see what they say \u2013 they won\u2019t have been paid for by the site. Be wary of a string of four- and five-star reviews, especially if written in tortured English in case they are from some paid-for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/oct/20/facebook-fake-amazon-review-factories-uncovered-which-investigation\">review \u2018factory\u2019</a></p> <p>Peter Janes, chief executive of payment solution Shieldpay, warns that cut-price websites are \u201coften too good to be true\u201d, while ProPrivacy\u2019s Attila Tomaschek says counterfeiters are becoming increasingly skilful at producing tech products that appear to be legitimate but are not.</p> <p>\u201cConsumers should be extremely sceptical of any piece of tech, especially any particularly popular item, that is priced significantly lower than the suggested retail price,\u201d he warns.</p> <p>Crucially, consumers should make sure they understand their rights before making a purchase. \u201cIf you buy online from a seller in the UK or EU, the Consumer Contracts Regulations mean you can cancel the order until 14 days after you receive the goods \u2013 unless they\u2019re perishables or personalised \u2013 and you then have 14 days to send them back, even if it\u2019s just because you\u2019ve changed your mind,\u201d says MoneySavingExpert\u2019s Anthony Hill.</p> <p>However, it is never straightforward enforcing your rights on businesses that do not have a bricks-and-mortar presence in your own country, and is nearly impossible outside the EU. Buyers may find they have no legal right to return an item, even if it is faulty, which can cause a major headache for anyone wanting their money back.</p> <p>Even though some websites have their own return policies, they are not the law and<br>small print can be murky. \u201cNot every seller is equal \u2013 even within one website, there can be hundreds of different shops which have different rules and wildly different products,\u201d explains Dan Plant, consumer expert at <a href=\"http://hotukdeals.com/\">hotukdeals.com</a>. \u201cFor instance, some items ship from European warehouses, and you get pretty much the same protections as buying from a UK shop. Others don\u2019t, and the rights you have if something goes wrong are much less clear.\u201d</p> <p>Which? says if an online retailer is marketed to the UK \u2013 it has a UK site, it is advertised in the UK, or payment is shown in pounds sterling \u2013 English law \u201cshould apply to consumer rights issues with product deliveries and returns\u201d. However, it says enforcing these rights can be easier said than done.</p> <p>Website eGlobal Central has nine online stores across several countries, including the UK, but goods are shipped from Hong Kong where the company is based. It says: \u201cOur prices are customised to the demand and availability of the product from our customers and suppliers. This is also why our prices may vary when compared to our other European online stores.\u201d</p> <p>The company website claims all products are \u201c100% original and brand new\u201d and sourced \u201cfrom trusted official dealers\u201d.</p> <p>But reviews of the online shop on Trustpilot are mixed. Some are complimentary, but many other shoppers complain of losing money, with some believing goods would be shipped from the UK.</p> <p>Last May, James Clements from Cambridgeshire bought a mobile phone for \u00a3150 from eGlobal Central and paid via PayPal. The phone was sent to the wrong address, but when Clements tried to correct it by contacting the shipping company, he was told it was not possible.</p> <p>After emailing eGlobal Central, he was told the parcel would be sent back to Hong Kong which would take six to nine weeks, and he would then be refunded. He contacted eGlobal Central again after nine weeks, only to be told the order was still in transit.</p> <p>Ten months on and despite contacting the company several times, Clements has still not received a refund. \u201cPayPal\u2019s advice is to seek a refund from the supplier and then contact them. But they told me they couldn\u2019t help because it had been so long they can no longer open the case against the supplier,\u201d he says.

  "<p>At the time of the February cabinet reshuffle, eight weeks and an eternity ago, I was talking to a senior Tory about the power structure of the government. He remarked: \u201cBoris is not primus inter pares. He is first without equals. He is president, he is lord of all he surveys. The cabinet are just nodding dogs.\u201d As if to illustrate this, President Johnson let TV cameras into the cabinet room to film his <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-nhs-campaign-lies-cabinet-meeting-ministers-hospitals-a9250011.html\">ministers performing</a> a ridiculous nursery school call and response about their manifesto promises.</p> <p>The \u201clord of all he surveys\u201d is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/10/coronavirus-uk-live-boris-johnson-still-in-hospital-as-public-urged-to-stay-home-for-easter?page=with:block-5e9092728f08db3109f20560#block-5e9092728f08db3109f20560\">confined to hospital</a> by the coronavirus and the \u201cnodding dogs\u201d must do their best to prove that they do not deserve that derogatory label. A structure designed to concentrate the maximum amount of power at Number 10 must adapt to operating without a fully functional prime minister.</p> <p>His enforced absence coincides with an especially testing stretch of the crisis. What is crudely characterised as the \u201clives versus livelihoods\u201d argument is becoming sharper. There is a mounting debate within government about when and to what extent the lockdown might be relaxed. This is, paradoxically, a testament to its general success. Thus far, it has worked more effectively than government modelling anticipated when the prime minister reluctantly placed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/boris-johnson-orders-uk-lockdown-to-be-enforced-by-police\">closed-for-business sign</a> over most of Britain. Some doltish police officers have overstepped, a giant dunce\u2019s cap being awarded to the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-52228475\">chief constable of Northamptonshire</a> for threatening that his coppers would check shopping trolleys for \u201cnon-essential\u201d items. A recalcitrant minority of the public are behaving stupidly. But these are the exceptions, not the rule. There is both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/11/test-of-resolve-britons-warned-to-stay-at-home-as-temperatures-set-to-hit-26c\">extensive compliance</a> with and wide support for the lockdown.</p> <p>The initial anxiety within Number 10 that the citizenry would rapidly become rebellious has not been justified. I detect a tentative confidence among ministers and their scientific advisers that the lockdown is having the desired effect of preventing the outcome that petrified them most. The fear three weeks ago was that the NHS would be engulfed by many more cases than it could possibly handle, leading to huge numbers of avoidable deaths. Public horror would have been swiftly followed by public disgust with the leaders who allowed such a catastrophe to happen, irreparably shattering the Johnson government\u2019s authority and credibility. One senior Tory remarked to me at the end of last week: \u201cI take a big gulp before I say this because I know I am tempting fate, but the fact that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/apr/07/how-to-build-a-hospital-in-nine-days-emergency-architecture-in-a-pandemic-coronavirus-outbreak\">London Nightingale</a> is not full at the moment is grounds for optimism.\u201d</p> <p>The other side of the coin is the terrible cost being inflicted on businesses and jobs by imposing a hard stop on the economy. Ministers knew it would be dreadful, but didn\u2019t anticipate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-jobs-bailout-treasury-resolution-foundation-wage-subsidy-scheme\">just how atrocious</a>. The Treasury is now expecting a whopping 9m applications for the job retention scheme that subsidises the wages of furloughed employees, three times the number budgeted for when Rishi Sunak launched his emergency measures. So we have indications that the most diabolical scenarios for deaths may be avoided while the economic penalties are becoming increasingly stark and that combination is reshaping the politics of the crisis. There are rising demands from the headline-hungry media, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/10/labour-will-keep-you-safe-says-new-shadow-home-secretary\">an attention-seeking opposition</a> and stricken businesses for the government to start outlining an exit strategy.</p> <p>Ministers are hugely reluctant to do this for two main reasons. One is their anxiety that any talk about an exit from lockdown will dilute the \u201cstay at home, protect the NHS, save lives\u201d messaging. The other reason ministers don\u2019t want to talk about an exit strategy is that they don\u2019t have an agreed one. As a figure at the heart of decision-making puts it: \u201cThere is no get-out-of-jail-free card from this crisis.\u201d</p> <p>The most assured way back to normality is mass vaccination, but it is generally thought that a vaccine is a year to 18 months away. The assumption in government is that you can\u2019t keep a modern economy in an induced coma for that long and expect to have many businesses and jobs still breathing by the end of it. Absent a vaccine, all sorts of notions for a phased easing of the lockdown are floating around Whitehall. Many of them shrivel under scrutiny. One suggestion is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/09/lifting-lockdown-uk-options-graded-return-normality\">partial relaxation based on age</a>, so that twentysomethings could return to work. There would be problems with policing that successfully: \u201cYou don\u2019t look younger than 30 to me, sir. Show me some ID.\u201d And most enterprises do not depend on just one age group. Another notion floated is that the severity of the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/06/government-urged-consider-regional-approach-ending-uk-coronavirus/\">lockdown might be varied</a> from region to region. There are some difficulties with that. If the pubs were reopened in London, but remained shut in Manchester, how would Mancunians react to TV footage of Londoners flocking back to their boozers? \u201cThe worst of all worlds,\u201d says the city\u2019s mayor, Andy Burnham. \u201cThat\u2019s when you get a riot,\u201d remarks a former Tory cabinet minister.</p> <p>The great hope among the politicians is that science will rescue them from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/07/coronavirus-culture-war-lockdown-economy\">\u201clives versus livelihoods\u201d</a> dilemma. There was a period when the government became excited about the idea that we could find out who has had the disease by using antibody tests. That was hailed as \u201ca game-changer\u201d by Mr Johnson before he was incapacitated. Millions of kits were <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/uk-says-millions-coronavirus-test-kits-bought-china-unreliable-most-patients-1496506\">ordered from China</a> only for them to be found unreliable. There is a decent chance of eventually securing an accurate antibody test. It would be valuable to be able to tell NHS staff and other key employees that they had immunity and were safe to work. But it doesn\u2019t solve the problem with the general population. The latest guesstimate from the government\u2019s scientific advisers is that no more than 10% of us have had the virus. Even if you could identify them, this leaves 90% exposed to the risk of infection. That is not a route out of lockdown.</p> <p>When the histories of this crisis are written, it is likely that they will conclude that the colossal misjudgment initially made in Europe and America was to think this threat was similar to that from pandemic flu. Asian countries, battle-readied by earlier encounters with coronaviruses, treated the menace like Sars and Mers. South Korea has never had more than eight deaths on any one day and has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/world/asia/coronavirus-south-korea-flatten-curve.html\">achieved this feat</a> without a national lockdown. </p> <p>That is generally attributed to their comprehensive programme of community testing and contact tracing. A similar strategy may become feasible for Britain if the government can make good on <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/work/91/uk-science-research-and-technology-capability-and-influence-in-global-disease-outbreaks/publications/\">Matt Hancock\u2019s bravura promise</a> to get up to 100,000 tests a day. But it is no panacea. The South Korean formula requires the redeployment of vast numbers of local and central government officials and wouldn\u2019t work without near universal public trust and co-operation. </p> <p>Many in the cabinet are aghast at the crushing of the economy and the prospect of a contraction sharper than anything since the 1930s. They will seize on any apparently better news to argue for the earliest possible relief from lockdown. This faction is not being very noisy while bulletins report around a thousand UK fatalities a day. It will be when the casualty rate is on a downward trend that the put-the-economy-first lobby will start to apply serious pressure. Others in government are worried that passing the peak will be the most perilous phase of the crisis because it will be accompanied by a clamour for an end to restrictions. One senior adviser warns: \u201cTo suddenly switch from \u2018we\u2019ve got it under control\u2019 to \u2018release all measures\u2019 would be a terrible mistake.\u201d</p> <p>This won\u2019t be like the end of prohibition in America. There won\u2019t be an overnight flip from suppression to freedom to live life to the full again. What we will likely see is experimental relaxations of some restrictions. If the government gets it wrong, there will be a risk of a second wave of infections that forces them to reimpose a lockdown.</p> <p>When this crisis broke, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/01/faced-with-coronavirus-covid-19-boris-johnston-must-stop-playing-invisible-man\">I suggested</a> that ministers would be faced with hideously difficult tradeoffs between curbing the menace to life posed by the disease and the damage wreaked by widespread bankruptcies, mass unemployment and the implications for Britain\u2019s future ability to finance public services, all of which will have effects on mortality. </p> <p>This is the sort of decision-making that prime ministers are elected to lead. When members of the cabinet wish a speedy recovery for Boris Johnson, it is not just because they want to express sympathy with a poorly boss. It is because they know that the toughest choices of this crisis have yet to be made.</p> <p>\u2022<em> </em>Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",
  "<p>Yesterday, I had a conversation with the delivery driver, who I must have seen many times before but have never really talked to. We told each other to keep safe; I said I was grateful for all he was doing and he said \u201cbless you\u201d and blew me a kiss. I talked, at a distance, with the postman. I went to the supermarket and in the snaking, spaced queue, I chatted to the person in front, the person behind and the one to my side and it was like a rueful little party. I talked through the glass to the woman at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/21/undervalued-heroes-coronavirus-crisis-cleaners-supermarket-workers\">the checkout</a> and she told me how she was feeling about her new duties and how she was tired out.</p> <p>I talked across the hedge to my 85-year-old neighbour when I delivered his milk and vegetables and he gave me a little plant in a pot that he\u2019d grown as a thank you. I rang a friend to tell her I loved her. I smiled at the stranger on the other side of the road and she waved at me, because it felt like we were suddenly friends, made so by going through the same experience together, the one everyone is going through, kept apart by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/apr/09/how-coronavirus-changed-the-world-in-three-months-video\">the virus</a> and yet drawn together by it.</p> <p>I can\u2019t see my daughter, who\u2019s a doctor and working all hours. I can\u2019t see my mother, in her late 80s and frail and doughty, who I want to put my arms around. But in this radically rearranged world of ours, I am suddenly seeing people who were always there but I have been blind to and I am belatedly learning to value them as they should always have been valued. In these days of fear and loss, everybody is dependent on the kindness of strangers.</p> <p>At Easter, families expect to come together, friends to gather, congregations to kneel in collective prayer. But the music has stopped and here we are, each of us suspended in our particular place, as if time had also stopped, the giddy momentum of life halted.</p> <p>Some are with people they love; some with people they need to escape but cannot; others are quite alone. Some are privileged enough to have a garden and open spaces; others are pinned in tiny rooms. Some are suffering unimaginable hardships and losses. All of us are living in a profoundly changed world, where we can no longer go where we choose, see who we want, hug who we will, feel safe, think of the body as a source of desire and comfort and connection.</p> <p>Humans need connection - we are social animals and exist in a network of reciprocal relationships. Solitary confinement is a form of torture that can swiftly drive people mad: locked into the cell of the self, the world does not reach them and they cannot reach out into the world. Words need to be heard, pain recognised, joy shared. Loneliness is hazardous.</p> <p>These past extraordinary weeks have shown how much we yearn for connection and also how ingenious, funny, imaginative, heartbreakingly generous and kind people can be in maintaining it in spite of imposed isolation. Skype and FaceTime and Houseparty and Zoom (whoever had heard of Zoom in February? Not me); competitions and online quizzes, board games, long-distance drinks and dinners, room crawls, online lessons, energetic workouts and yoga sessions, stitched-together concerts with each musician in their own room and yet fused by the music they produce, blogs and vlogs and old-fashioned phone calls, emails and handwritten letters, invitations to imitate a work of art, share a recipe, learn a poem\u2026</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Humans need connection - we are social animals and exist in a network of reciprocal relationships</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>More than this, I have heard over and over how people say they are talking to each other now \u2013 talking as they never have before, revealing themselves. It is as if a skin has been peeled away; sometimes painfully, we have come face to face with our own vulnerability and precariousness. A <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/coronavirus-boy-death-hospital-london-youngest-uk-ismail-abdulwahab-a9439526.html\">boy dies in hospital</a> without his family and is buried without them; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/07/care-home-residents-connected-in-lockdown\">relatives look through </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/07/care-home-residents-connected-in-lockdown\">window</a>s at their loved ones in residential homes; people say goodbye to the gravely ill by Skype.</p> <p>We can no longer pretend to ourselves we are self-sufficient, autonomous, invincible and in control. More helpless, more exposed, more reliant on the generosity of others and aware of our own mortality, we can speak things we previously kept hidden. We can ask ourselves what really matters, in this world of ours that we all hold in common.</p> <p>Loneliness is a grief, sometimes a kind of despair. It is possible that during these coronavirus days, the profoundly lonely in our society have felt less so. People are talking to them now; neighbours they have never previously met are knocking on their door and offering to help or are asking for their help. A mighty collective experience draws everyone together and the brief, crisis-driven experience of isolation may have given us more empathetic understanding of what it is to be truly alone and on the margins of society.</p> <p>These days will come to an end. We will be able to travel the country, swim in the sea, sit in each other\u2019s rooms, lean over tables in restaurants and pubs, dance, hug each other at last with bodies that are no longer contagious. But we mustn\u2019t go back to the world that we were living in before or unlearn the hard-won lessons of collaboration, kindness, empathy and human vulnerability. We mustn\u2019t stop seeing and valuing the delivery driver, the hospital cleaner, the residential worker, the woman at the checkout, the neighbour over the fence, the stranger on the other side of the road, the person in need, the old and the frail and the forgotten, those hidden in life\u2019s shadows.</p> <p>When this is over, there will still be the isolated and lonely, who for a few months may have been included in a shared purpose and collective experience. Easter, for those with faith and those without, is a festival of life and death. It\u2019s about redemption and it asks what it means to be human. In the midst of fear and helplessness and loss, because of fear and helplessness and loss, we can begin to change. We can do it better.

  "<p>The past few weeks has seen an unstoppable epidemic \u2026 of <a href=\"https://www.significancemagazine.com/science/652-a-statistician-s-guide-to-coronavirus-numbers\">statistics</a>. The flood threatens to overwhelm us all, but what do all these numbers mean? Here are eight statistics you may see, with some warnings about how much we might trust them.<br></p> \n<p><strong>1 The number of new cases each day</strong> This can be a very poor reflection of the number of people who have actually been infected, as it depends crucially on the testing regime \u2013 up to 9 April, 1.3 million tests had been carried out in Germany, versus 317,000 in the UK.</p> \n<p><strong>2 The number of new deaths each day</strong> The range of <a href=\"https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/reconciling-covid-19-death-data-in-the-uk/\">sources</a> is bewildering. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public\">daily announcements</a> should be treated with caution as they only include deaths in hospital of those who have tested positive for coronavirus, and there is generally a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/why-what-we-think-we-know-about-the-uks-coronavirus-death-toll-is-wrong\">delay in reporting deaths</a> of a few days or even longer. For example, while on 27 March the government announced that 926 Covid-19 deaths had so far taken place in English hospitals, <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-daily-deaths/\">NHS England</a> now reports that the true figure was 1,649. The gold standard is the number of death certificates collated by the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending27march2020\">Office for National Statistics</a>: it report at least 1,568 mentions of Covid-19 for all deaths up to 27 March, but this will increase as registrations come in.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ba9786c6-c779-4063-8bf9-1d3009eb7c70\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3qV7R2iYVXg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>3</strong> <strong>The total number of deaths</strong> Graphs of accumulating deaths are shown at the daily government press conference, but they are a hopeless tool for spotting trends: we need daily counts to see whether we have reached a plateau (which will not be a \u201cpeak\u201d). But the daily counts are volatile, and so need some smoothing to bring out the underlying trends: <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/daily-covid-deaths-3-day-average\">World in Data</a> uses a three-day moving average.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/five-months-on-what-scientists-now-know-about-the-coronavirus\">Five months on, what scientists now know about the coronavirus</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>4 Numbers </strong><strong>recorded on a logarithmic scale</strong> This will have a vertical axis labelled 1, 10, 100, 1,000. These are useful for comparing trends, but useless for getting an impression of the magnitude of the problem.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Our World in Data\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/daily-covid-deaths-3-day-average\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p><br><strong>5</strong> <strong>Predictions from models</strong> Computer models come in two types. The first tries to model the epidemic itself, by making simplified assumptions about the mechanism by which a virus spreads through a community. Key quantities, such as how many people an average case will infect, are highly uncertain at the start of an epidemic but are refined as more data is gathered. Such models have formed the basis for predicting the consequences of policy decisions in the UK.</p> \n<p>The second type of model is purely empirical, fitting curves to the observed data, and making strong assumptions about the shape of the curve to extrapolate into the future. These projections need to be viewed with extreme caution since they can be extremely sensitive to a few data points. On 9 April, US organisation <a href=\"https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-kingdom\">IHME</a> predicted an eventual 66,000 UK Covid-19 deaths but this had dropped to 37,000 three days later \u2013 it is difficult to take such modelling seriously. Model predictions should always acknowledge uncertainty, although this is rarely reported by the media.</p> \n<p><strong>6 \u201cExcess deaths\u201d</strong> The number of extra deaths that will be recorded in this period, due either to Covid-19 or the lockdown, is hotly contested. Lives will be lost because of the illness, reduced medical care for everyone, domestic violence and the effects of unemployment and poverty; and lives will be saved through fewer accidents and, particularly, improved air quality. A (disputed) fraction of those dying would have died anyway in the coming year, a phenomenon known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_displacement\">mortality displacement or even \u201charvesting\u201d</a>. But the overall effect is hard to predict, and confident claims should be treated with scepticism.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"04fcb605-dc6b-400f-9a32-dea28497dcee\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sMtzWVTPmLI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>7 The lethal risks of being infected</strong> These vary dramatically with age and frailty, just as \u201cnormal\u201d risks do. In fact the current estimates for the general public (rather than healthcare workers) seem remarkably similar to the <a href=\"https://medium.com/wintoncentre/how-much-normal-risk-does-covid-represent-4539118e1196\">risks we face anyway each year</a> \u2013 but all packed into a few weeks.</p> \n<p><strong>8 The \u201caccuracy\u201d of an antibody test</strong> Even apparently accurate antibody tests can lead to many <a href=\"https://medium.com/wintoncentre/the-problems-of-a-bad-test-for-covid-19-antibodies-dbe169f2a11b\">false assurances of immunity</a>. But a less accurate test may be fine if we are testing a representative sample to estimate the proportion of a population who have immunity.</p> \n<p>Finally, it\u2019s tempting to link a country\u2019s statistics to the measures they have taken to control the virus: for example, has Sweden\u2019s more relaxed policy been as effective as lockdown? But countries differ in so many ways: basic demographics, compliance and social networks, testing capacity and policy, health service characteristics and so on. Former prime minister Carl Bildt has joked that Swedes \u201chave a genetic disposition to social distancing anyway\u201d.</p> \n<p><em>Sylvia Richardson, director, MRC Biostatistics Unit, president elect of the Royal Statistical Society; David Spiegelhalter, chairman, Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication</em></p>",
  "<p>For most people, being stuck in lockdown with 11-week-old twins and a 21-month-old toddler would be torture. But the explorer Steve Backshall is used to living in tough and challenging environments around the world. \u201cI\u2019ve spent so much of my life away in a field, sleeping in a tent, that to have this amount of time with the family at home is actually a real privilege.

We were writing the maps as we went.\u201d</p> <p>It is to those waterways he goes now, in his mind\u2019s eye, when he wants to remember one of the most amazing sights he ever saw. \u201cWe heard this thundering ahead of us in the forest and we came around the corner to a waterfall that was nearly 100 metres high \u2013 it\u2019s the second-biggest waterfall in the country, and totally unknown. None of the local people or villagers had any idea it existed. We were the first people to map it, the first people to record its existence.\u201d</p> <p>He decided to name it after their Surinamese colleague, Isla. \u201cWe called it the Isla Falls. It pours down through the forest in a series of cataracts, and is really broad and wide as well as high.\u201d</p> <p>On one of the highest promontories of the waterfall, he found fresh jaguar droppings. \u201cIt was clear that, probably as early as the day before, a jaguar had come out and sat at the top of the waterfall where we were standing, looking down at the view. Which was pretty amazing.\u201d There were otters, harpy eagles and tapirs wanderingaround the valley, too. \u201cClearly, they had never seen human beings before. It was just absolutely dazzling.\u201d</p> <p>A Bafta-winning adventurer and wildlife presenter, Backshall had been planning some of the expeditions for more than 20 years. \u201cExpeditions have been my life ever since I was in my late teens. I\u2019ve been putting together this little black book of expeditions that were really special and, hand on heart, had not been done before.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Our desire to push back new frontiers sets us apart as a species ... but I couldn't tell my wife I'd come within a minute of drowning that day</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They included kayaking along the largest fjord in the world \u2013 in Greenland, the first ascents of desert mountains and descents of desert canyons in Oman, and cave diving in Mexico through passageways that had never been explored. By linking up with several television channels, he got enough funding to put together a tiny team of experts and do them all in a single year. \u201cIt was the hardest year I\u2019ve ever had. Apart from anything else, during that same year, I built a house, nearly went bankrupt and had my first baby. So, all round, a pretty big year.\u201d</p> <p>He almost drowned while making the first-ever descent of a whitewater river in Bhutan in the Himalayas. \u201cIt was so dramatic. This river tumbles down and, over several miles of vertical descent, thrashes its way down through these incredible remote canyons.\u201d He would plummet down a rapid \u201choping to goodness\u201d there wouldn\u2019t be something hideous halfway down. One day, there was. \u201cI basically plunged off the face of the earth into this recirculating wave, a drop of a small waterfall, and the bottom of it caught me and just dragged me back in again.\u201d</p> <p>He was in a plastic kayak about 2.5 metres long and, despite pulling the release cord, was held under the water for nearly five minutes. \u201cBear in mind the water is glacial meltwater, very close to freezing point. I was, without question, drowning. There was nothing I could do to save myself. I was out of energy, out of ideas. It was absolutely terrifying.\u201d Miraculously, a member of his crew managed to battle upstream against the rapids, get a rope to him and drag him out. \u201cShe saved my life.\u201d</p> <p>He drank half a bottle of scotch that night, hoping the whole project would just \u201cgo away\u201d and dreading the thought of getting back into his kayak the next morning. \u201cI remember calling home to Helen, my wife, and she talked for about 15 minutes about missing her junction on the motorway. And I just couldn\u2019t tell her. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to tell her I\u2019d come within a minute of drowning that day.\u201d Their baby was just three months old at the time. \u201cIt was full on. It was really intense.\u201d</p> <p>But he forced himself to carry on. \u201cI knew that if I didn\u2019t get back in that kayak the whole expedition would be over.\u201d</p> <p>He perceives his desire to explore the world as a fundamentally human trait. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the things that sets us apart as a species: our desire to understand, to push back new frontiers. There is an assumption that all of that was done years ago, that there is no more old-fashioned exploration to be done. But there is: you just need to look a lot harder nowadays.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03a87fbe46f4efaab87ae60b8b3444f5b76e9c06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03a87fbe46f4efaab87ae60b8b3444f5b76e9c06/0_100_8660_5199/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nakhur Gorge, Wadi Ghul, Oman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nakhur Gorge, Wadi Ghul, Oman, is known for its beautiful hiking trails, but there remain desert canyons in the sultanate still untrodden by humans.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ulrich Hollmann/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the desert and the jungle, he felt a deep connection to the explorers of the past, imagining them in their pith helmets, looking for gold and other riches. \u201cBut in other places, not really. For example, cave diving: that\u2019s very much a modern realm of exploration. You\u2019re using modern tech as a way of finding your way into places that people haven\u2019t been to before.\u201d</p> <p>The desert expeditions in Oman were, he says, the most extraordinary. \u201cThere are still desert canyons there where nobody has ever set foot. To be able to head down into one and know that our feet were the first to step on that rock was pretty amazing.\u201d</p> <p>It made him feel his own existence was just one small aspect of something bigger. \u201cOn desert nights \u2013 where the stars just seem to be so close that you could reach up and pluck them, and the silence is so quiet that it\u2019s loud \u2013 you have an incredible connection to the natural world.\u201d</p> <p>Another highlight came when, during ascents of desert rock faces, he managed to record shots of the critically endangered Arabian leopard that was using the same trails. \u201cThere are only a handful of them left. It gave me this incredible sense of privilege, that I was walking in the footsteps of something so rare.\u201d</p> <p>Overall, the year gave him a sense of quite how many natural wonders there are in the world to treasure and protect. \u201cI think it\u2019s incredibly important that people realise there are still parts of the planet we haven\u2019t managed to ruin yet. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/brazil-scales-back-environmental-enforcement-coronavirus-outbreak-deforestation\">It\u2019s our job to make sure they stay beautiful and pristine</a>.\u201d</p> <p>But most importantly of all, it made him appreciate how wonderful it is to be at home in the house in Buckinghamshirefrom which he presents live homeschooling lessons about wildlife every Wednesday at 9.30am on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm-URP49TgSgyIU1rgh2m7A\">his YouTube channel, </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm-URP49TgSgyIU1rgh2m7A\">SteveBackshallOfficial</a>. </p> <p>\u201cI realised how important family is to me.

But actually what I came away feeling, more than anything, was just a real sense of how much it meant to me to be a dad, and how much I was missing not being at home with them.\u201d</p> <p>And that, he says apologetically, is all he has time for. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to wrap this up now.

  "<p>Chilling figures that show a surge in domestic abuse are beginning to emerge as couples spend enforced time in their homes together during the Covid-19 lockdown. Ten women were killed by men* (five of the victims were within married couples) in the UK between 23 March, when government lockdown restrictions began, and 6 April. The <a href=\"https://www.nationaldahelpline.org.uk/\">National Domestic Abuse</a> hotline, run by charity Refuge, reported a 25% increase in calls in the same period, and between 26<sup> </sup>March and 1<sup> </sup>April, <a href=\"https://www.womensaid.org.uk/\">Women\u2019s Aid</a> experienced a 41% increase in users visiting its Live Chat site, compared to the previous week.</p> <p>I fear that these statistics will tragically worsen over the coming weeks, as more and more women suffer increased levels of abuse at the hands of their partners. I know, from personal experience, what it is like to live like this, and the prospect of doing so 24/7 is unimaginable, with potentially devastating consequences for thousands of women.</p> <p>Within weeks of me saying my marriage vows and having a simple band of gold slipped on to my finger, my life became more complicated. Lovingly prepared home-cooked dinners were angrily rejected by my new husband because I hadn\u2019t predicted his preferred meal that day. I\u2019d dress for a night out and be told he didn\u2019t like my choice of outfit. Phone calls to old friends began to feel uncomfortable as he lurked nearby, monitoring my conversations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/07/the-guardian-view-on-tackling-domestic-abuse-when-home-isnt-a-haven\">The Guardian view on tackling domestic abuse: when home isn\u2019t a haven</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I naively accepted these foibles as the reality of married life: the human flaws surfacing after the veneer of dating falls away.

Since December 2015, this emotional and mental manipulation of someone in an intimate relationship has been formally recognised in criminal law as a corrosive form of domestic abuse \u2013 and often, as it was for me, too, a precursor and adjunct to physical violence.</p> <p>Gradually, he chipped away, artfully alienating my small circle of friends, manipulating me to his moulded vision of wifely submission, undermining all my independent decisions, actions or emotions. After a while, weary of the daily commute \u2013 and perhaps subliminally hoping that I might restore some of the magic in our relationship \u2013 I began to work for myself, from a desk in the spare room of our cottage.</p> <p>But my new-found liberation from corporate life had the opposite effect on my domestic life. I became a prisoner in my own home, answerable not to a boss but to an increasingly demanding husband, fuelled by spiralling alcohol consumption that made him more volatile than ever. The slightest thing might trigger his rage, leaving me in a state of heightened alert in his presence.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He chipped away, artfully alienating my friends, undermining all my independent decisions, actions or emotions</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was no longer a jibe or the silent treatment that came when I made the mistake of occupying the bathroom if he wanted to shower, but an angry fist punched through the ceiling or a hand around my neck, pinning me to the cold tiled wall, my feet hovering inches from the floor.</p> <p>The stench of alcohol on his breath that accompanied a slightly maniacal glint in his eyes meant I knew I was likely to wake the next morning with a tender, dark purple patch somewhere on my body. I took to wearing rollnecks and scarves, even on warmer days, and was using concealer in industrial quantities. My wrists were often red raw from his vice-like grip, and my eyes were pink and puffy from the constant crying. Sunglasses became an essential accessory. I lost count of the vases and pieces of crockery that met their end after violent contact with the wall or floor. I began to fear I might suffer the same fate.</p> <p>The darkest days came when the violence wasn\u2019t \u201cmerely\u201d a shove, a slap or even semi-strangulation but brutal, demanding, agonising sex against my will, that left me gasping and streaming tears into a pillow that I wished would suffocate me. It was, of course, rape. Even between spouses, non-consensual sex is a traumatic assault: no less of a crime than a harrowing attack on a stranger.</p> <p>After 10 increasingly turbulent years, my living hell ended in a court injunction and a prolonged, acrimonious divorce. The wounds have healed but the scars will always remain. Today, I fear for the millions of vulnerable women and men around the world who will struggle to escape abusive partners.<br>*<em>Compared to just over three on average over the same period in each of the years from 2012 to 2019, according to the femicide census</em><br></p> <h2>How to get help</h2> <p>Anyone can be a victim of domestic abuse, regardless of gender, age, ethnicity, socio-economic status, sexuality or background.

  "<p>We ended up in lockdown in, I believe this is the technical term, the arse end of nowhere. We were on holiday here and decided to stay put for the moment \u2013 no one else will be arriving for a break any time soon. I don\u2019t know if it was the right call and I\u2019d rather be home, but we are wildly lucky. There\u2019s space, air and a view of extraordinary empty beauty, punctuated only by the odd sheep or exhibitionist chicken (aka pheasant). There\u2019s a small telly, enough heating oil for a while and tons of books, even if most of them are by Len Deighton.</p> <p>We are adapting with varying degrees of success. My husband, a man who runs worst-case scenario plans to lull himself to sleep, is rising to an occasion he has prepared for his whole life. He\u2019s purposeful and calm, alternating unnecessary DIY (he\u2019s \u201cfixing\u201d a chair I suspect wasn\u2019t broken as I type), fire-related tasks and trying unsuccessfully to organise family jollity (we have always loathed collective fun and continuity is important at a time like this).</p> <p>For someone habitually nourished by a steady drip of HBO drama and vegan protein powder, my nearly 18-year-old is adapting well. He has gone Full Survivalist, digging a trench for vegetables and chopping wood to replace his gym trips (\u201cIf you cut your foot off, you\u2019ll be lucky to see a vet!\u201d I screech, gesticulating at him through the window. \u201cThey\u2019re all lambing!\u201d) He\u2019s also tending a forest of Marks &amp; Spencer Little Garden seeds, surely the unlikeliest craze since loom bands. The 16-year-old is teaching himself to play the piano between bouts of catatonic boredom. The elderly dog is happiest: the whole pack is home and when we go out, he can chase rabbits until his feeble city legs betray him.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My husband is rising to an occasion he has prepared for his whole life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a fully fledged bird pervert, I love the eerie whoop of curlews and flocks of oystercatchers, ludicrous cartoon birds with giant orange beaks. A squabbling rainbow of finches and tits on the feeder is better than Netflix. I\u2019m also enjoying daily games of \u201cbest-before chicken\u201d \u2013 the cupboards are a cornucopia of delights for those of a robust stomach. I\u2019m grateful to whoever went mad for pulses in the 1990s, though why the only seasoning is nutmeg and dusty bay leaves (useless at the best of times) is anyone\u2019s guess. My wimp family refused to try the only slightly acidic 2015 salsa, but I\u2019m enjoying it with 2013 crackers (damp but edible). As a weekend activity, we made I Can\u2019t Believe It\u2019s Not Cake: an unholy blend of oil, 2011 flour, rock-solid sugar and bicarb, plus an egg and yogurt. It was fine. \u201cIt\u2019s fine!\u201d is my mantra currently, and it mainly is.</p> <p>With one huge exception: the internet. We are literally off-grid, with no network coverage. Theoretically, there is wifi, though not enough to stream or download (with two teenagers). All talk of Zoom and Houseparty seems a futuristic world away. On good days, we can email and check in with family and friends; occasionally I Instagram a bleak moor.</p> <p>But the wifi is ailing. Sometimes there\u2019s a long stretch with no outages; other days it refuses to co-operate. I wake in a panic (yes, I know, we all do at the moment) and come downstairs, heart in mouth, to check the home-hub light: blue for OK, flashing orange for misery. On orange days, I\u2019m a hot mess, cycling through anxiety, rage and exhaustion from repeatedly trekking to the only patch of 4G for miles, the size of a single sheep and about as reliable.</p> <p>After a long outage, we now realise the connection wheezes back to life the instant we call BT: I know that sounds mad, but I swear it\u2019s true. While it\u2019s working, the phone stays off the hook: the hub seems to prefer that. \u201c<em>Don\u2019t touch it!</em>\u201d I snap when anyone strays near, hovering, Gollum-like, over the receiver.</p> <p>\u201cCorrelation isn\u2019t causation,\u201d says the 16-year-old, waspishly, playing an ancient Nintendo DS game in his pyjamas at 3pm. \u201cIt works,\u201d I insist, bug-eyed. \u201cWe just need to do exactly what the hub wants us to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPretty sure this is how religions start,\u201d says the elder.</p> <p>I know it sounds like a bleat of privilege, but connection is oxygen: that joke version of Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs with \u201cwifi\u201d scrawled at the bottom is no joke now. You could say faaahm-lay is all that matters, Peggy Mitchell style, but faaahm-lay is not just the nuclear unit. It\u2019s my sister, still working in vital social care in Paris, my vulnerable stepfather and father miles in opposite directions; my poorly best friend.</p> <p>And community matters, too, more than ever.

  "<p>Though fans will hope and trust that a TV adaptation of Sally Rooney\u2019s <em>Normal People</em> would not shy from the novel\u2019s sexual intimacies, it keeps us waiting a while \u2013 it is not until the second episode that undercover teenage lovers Connell and Marianne get under the covers for the first time. For a few seconds, it all seems to be going comically wrong, as her arms and her ponytail flail above her head, trapped in her pull-off bra. But then her face emerges, shiny with trust and desire, and the fireworks begin. \u201cI love that scene,\u201d says Daisy Edgar-Jones. \u201cIt\u2019s so awkward. For me, it is the most representative love scene I\u2019ve ever seen. Connell is so kind and giving and safe with her that it\u2019s a very healthy depiction of what first-time sex can look like.\u201d</p> <p>This might make it sound a bit PG, but as her co-star Paul Mescal quickly chips in: \u201cIt\u2019s not clinical. It\u2019s loving and romantic and sexy because you see two minds coming together.\u201d To describe the adaptation as hotly anticipated is an understatement. Rooney herself has co-scripted six of the episodes in collaboration with award-winning playwright and story editor on series two of HBO\u2019s <em>Succession</em> Alice Birch, who recalls \u201choovering up\u201d the novel in a jetlagged blur and immediately emailing her agent to say she was desperate to adapt it. \u201cI felt very emotional about those two people. I don\u2019t often have this feeling. In our industry, we can be quite quick to enjoy a book and then immediately think about how to hack it to bits for the screen.\u201d</p> <p>Birch is in good company. Practically as soon as Rooney hit the literary world with her debut novel <em>Conversations </em><em>With Friends</em> in 2017, she became a calling card for anyone who aspired to be seen as culturally attuned. Her novels were Instagrammed alongside chai lattes atop piles of on-trend books. She was name-dropped on Twitter by actors Lena Dunham and Sarah Jessica Parker, was featured in Florence + the Machine\u2019s fan book club, and was ranked high in books of the year charts by British <em>Vogue</em> and <em>O, The Oprah</em> <em>Magazine</em>. But she was also recognised as a writer\u2019s writer. \u201cIt is a long time since I cared so much about two characters on a page,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/it-is-time-to-take-a-sharp-inhale-people-sally-rooney-s-normal-people-is-superb-1.3608184\">wrote author Anne Enright</a><a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/it-is-time-to-take-a-sharp-inhale-people-sally-rooney-s-normal-people-is-superb-1.3608184\"> in the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/it-is-time-to-take-a-sharp-inhale-people-sally-rooney-s-normal-people-is-superb-1.3608184\">Irish Times</a>,</em> when <em>Normal People</em> was published a year later.</p> <p>Novelist and playwright Sebastian Barry, who took over from Enright as laureate for Irish fiction, says: \u201cThere is a uniqueness in Sally Rooney, not only in her absolutely crystal clear style, but also in her universal success. It is difficult to identify a comparable moment in Irish writing, both in its breadth and its immediacy, unless you can go back to the impact that the novel, and more particularly the film, of Roddy Doyle\u2019s <em>The Commitments</em> had in the early 1990s. There are other equally radiant careers, more conventionally spread over decades, like Anne Enright\u2019s, or Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn\u2019s, but the suddenness of Sally Rooney, the almost abrupt arrival, reminds me more of a figure like Martin McDonagh in the theatre. There is a time before Sally Rooney and a time after.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4p5yY0qdsWg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4p5yY0qdsWg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4p5yY0qdsWg&amp;feature=emb_logo\">Watch a trailer for Normal People.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The sales figures are huge for a literary novel, with <em>Normal People</em> running through seven editions, selling nearly 500,000 copies in the UK and 76,000 in Ireland, according to industry analysts Nielsen Bookscan. Translation rights have been sold into 41 languages. No pressure, then, on Edgar-Jones and Mescal, who are well aware that they are playing two of the most coveted TV roles in the world for their peers right now.</p> <p>Marianne and Connell are a couple striving to find each other through a fog of class, social status and their own failures to communicate. Connell\u2019s mother cleans Marianne\u2019s house. At their secondary school in Sligo, he is a popular sporting hero, while she is the scratchy school swot. Their attraction is as much intellectual as it is sexual, as they learn when they rediscover each other at university in Dublin, by which time their status has reversed: in this rarefied new ambience, she is the cool beauty, while he is the bristly outsider.</p> <p>The series marks the screen debut of Mescal, the 24-year-old son of a garda and a schoolteacher from County Kildare, who made his first professional appearance as an earlier charismatic outsider, Jay Gatsby, at Dublin\u2019s Gate theatre. He was appearing at another Dublin theatre, the Abbey, when he heard <em>Normal People</em> was being cast. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those parts that you know quickly will be big. I was around a lot of Irish actors at the time and we all felt we were Connell, in a sense,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Edgar-Jones, a 21-year-old Londoner whose mother is from Northern Ireland, is a relative TV veteran, who made her debut at 17 in the revival of the vintage comedy <em>Cold Feet</em>. She overheard a friend auditioning for the part at her kitchen table. \u201cAnd I thought: \u2018Hmm, that sounds good.\u2019 Then I got the book and I just fell in love with it.

Mescal was first to be cast, emerging from a big pool of actors over several rounds of auditions. Edgar-Jones got down to the last five on the strength of a \u201cself-tape\u201d that she had hurriedly recorded in a lunch break from another show. They have clearly become good friends. \u201cWhen Daisy walked into the room for the chemistry read, I immediately thought: \u2018That\u2019s who I imagined Marianne to look like,\u201d says Mescal.</p> <p>\u201cI saw Paul and thought: \u2018I know everything about you!\u2019 Which is stupid, because he\u2019s not Connell,\u201d adds Edgar-Jones.</p> <p>The fact that this instant recognition was the product of such a painstaking selection process seems entirely in keeping with the Rooney project: for all that her novels have been hailed as an emanation of the zeitgeist, they are also steeped in classic protocols. \u201c<em>Normal People</em> has the engine of a 19th-century novel,\u201d wrote Enright. \u201cThere is an encompassing sense of authority in the voice that makes it more terrible when the characters\u2019 lives start to slip away from them\u2026 Rooney is completely in control.\u201d There\u2019s a streak of DH Lawrence in the interraction of hunky sports jock Connell and poor little rich girl Marianne, just as there\u2019s a daub of Doris Lessing\u2019s <em>The Golden Notebook</em> in their determination to find their own political and erotic space (though true to Rooney\u2019s adversarial intelligence as a former debating champion, it\u2019s Connell who precociously name-drops the novel, rather than Marianne).</p> <p>The drama unfolds over four years \u2013 sweeping the lovers from school through university to the brink of their adult lives. One might have expected it to be adapted into a lush feature film, but instead it arrives in 12 half-hour TV episodes. The Oscar-nominated Irish film-maker Lenny Abrahamson, who co-directs the series, continues the story. \u201cIt used to be that only sitcoms were half an hour and if you wanted to tell a dramatic story, it had to be an hour. But we really liked the idea of short episodes, because it allows you to be single-focused,\u201d he explains, citing that first climactic sex scene: \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have had that density of focus over an hour.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25c12230f8a8281a23318e453b6991b1d646cc4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25c12230f8a8281a23318e453b6991b1d646cc4b/0_32_6000_3602/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daisy Edgar-Jones as Marianne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daisy Edgar-Jones as Marianne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Enda Bowe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen I hear the phrase \u2018sex scene\u2019, I think about a dialogue scene,\u201d Rooney told one interviewer. \u201cWhat do these characters want to say to each other? I won\u2019t just write a scene where two characters say words to each other randomly. Similarly, sex scenes have to actually play some dramatic role.\u201d <em>Irish Times</em> columnist and author Fintan O\u2019Toole picks up her point, saying: \u201cActually she reminds me of Chekhov in the acute, subtle and nonjudgmental way she calibrates human desires and foibles and self-delusions. She\u2019s not solipsistic \u2013 big things are going on underneath the intimacies: social class, money, gender, power. I think she\u2019s hit a nerve right now because we\u2019re in a moment when there\u2019s a heightened awareness that desire and sex cannot be extricated from all of these things. She\u2019s creating love stories for a post-romantic age.\u201d</p> <p>But the representation of those love stories is inevitably different in a novel, which deals in words, and on film, where articulacy lies in the manipulation of the human body. \u201cThe sex was a big challenge and we took it really seriously from the beginning,\u201d says Abrahamson. \u201cWhat we would aim to show, but also literally how we would do the sex in a way that was positive, safe and healthy for everyone involved both in front of and behind the camera.\u201d</p> <p>Not least of the challenges was the issue of asymmetry \u2013 of both gender and status \u2013 which has cast such a shadow over the media world in the era of #MeToo. The theatre, film and TV director Hettie Macdonald is responsible for six of the episodes. \u201cI wanted to make it a more gender-balanced crew right from the start,\u201d says Abrahamson. \u201cIt\u2019s often the case that crews are very male-dominated, especially in the camera department, and I\u2019m beginning to see that there\u2019s less and less reason for that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut here\u2019s the biggest thing for me,\u201dhe adds. \u201cI\u2019m in my 50s and as far as the young actors are concerned, I\u2019m successful. My worry would be \u2013 because I\u2019m squeamish about ever doing anything uncomfortable for them \u2013 that they would feel under pressure to do what I wanted, and my fear of that would stop me from asking.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e138133738e7b331c28167406eff21811e585a65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e138133738e7b331c28167406eff21811e585a65/0_52_769_461/500..jpg\" alt=\"Behind the scenes on the shoot.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Behind the scenes on the shoot, with Lenny Abrahamson second from left and cinematographer Suzie Lavelle second from right.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The breakthrough was the decision to hire the services of \u201cintimacy co-ordinator\u201d Ita O\u2019Brien. \u201cI was anxious to start with because I thought the most subtle and important moments would be between me and the actors,\u201d admits Abrahamson. \u201cBut what\u2019s brilliant is that she would come in and talk to the whole crew and production about simple things like not using euphemisms, about getting explicit consent every time you\u2019re about to do something and finding a language to talk about lovemaking, and the shapes and moods of it, that is empowering for the people involved.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s the go-to,\u201d agrees Mescal. \u201cShe\u2019s brilliant,\u201d says Edgar-Jones. \u201cThe sex scenes were a joy to us because it was her job to worry about how it would work and we just turned up, did the choreography and carried on. We just had to think about the emotional beats.\u201d</p> <p>For Edgar-Jones, this sensitivity extends importantly to the use of nudity. \u201cWhat I\u2019m really happy with is that there\u2019s an equal representation of both our bodies. Paul is equally exposed. When we\u2019re in a scene and topless, it\u2019s different for Paul than it is for me, so that it\u2019s nice that there are shots where we are both fully nude! It means that there\u2019s more of a balance, gender-wise.\u201d One of the puzzling features of the intense identification of readers with Connell and Marianne is that they inhabit a pretty rarefied cultural niche, with its own intellectual and political snobberies. They discuss critical theory and <em>The Communist Manifesto</em> and despise fellow students who don\u2019t put in the reading. At school, Marianne turns her loneliness into an arrogant aloofness which is part of her appeal to Connell, making more popular girls seem dull and samey. Rooney herself has said she had expected the novels only to appeal to \u201cpeople who share my ideology or have a similarly jaundiced view of social systems.\u201d</p> <p>How does this aspect of the story connect with its young stars? \u201cI definitely related to Marianne at school in some ways, particularly the perception she thinks other people have of her, and playing with whether she can change that,\u201d says Edgar-Jones. \u201cI went to a very small school [the independent Mount school for girls in north London]. You grow so much as a person from 11 to 16, and by the end I felt I was fundamentally different to who I was when I began, but my friends only ever saw how I was when I was 11. When I did my first course at the National Youth Theatre at 15, suddenly, there were loads of people who were passionate about the same things, so I was able to colour in the shape I had grown into.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd0a21378b69ba54d5db9a77169507fc313b6ad7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd0a21378b69ba54d5db9a77169507fc313b6ad7/0_595_3456_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sally Rooney.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018When I hear the phrase \u201csex scene\u201d, I think about a dialogue scene\u2019: Sally Rooney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Buchan/Variety/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mescal, like Connell in the film, was an academically bright Gaelic football star, who decided to veer off in an unexpected direction \u2013 in his case by taking himself off to the Lir Academy, a drama school attached to Trinity College Dublin. \u201cThat stepping out can make you feel quite naked for a while. I had no prior conception of what drama school, or a life in acting, was going to look like,\u201d he says. The university social scene is treated with a particular disdain by Rooney as a place of privileged poseurs. \u201cI was off-campus on the Conservatoire side of training, but when you venture on campus and you go to house parties, you definitely feel that degree of performance that we see at those house parties in the book. The social class performance\u2026 Sally really captures that,\u201d says Mescal.</p> <p>But in one respect the characters are quite separate from their generation. \u201cIt is funny because this has been called a millennial novel but they don\u2019t meet over a dating app,\u201d points out Edgar-Jones. \u201cThey meet in real life and they have real conversations. They don\u2019t do that much texting, they talk. That\u2019s healthy and exciting and important to show that it does still happen. We\u2019re not all chatting over Facebook Messenger, we do still have intimate, face-to-face relationships.\u201d</p> <p>Rooney herself has said she\u2019s more involved with social media than Connell and Marianne, though she abandoned her pugnacious Twitter account in 2019 with a parting line that would do Marianne proud: \u201cjust for clarity, I continue to agree with all your good opinions and disagree with your bad ones (of which I\u2019m sad to say there are many)\u201d.</p> <p>Mescal admits: \u201cMy experience of myself and my peers is that Connell and Marianne are in the minority. I do think intimacy and intimate relationships are more difficult in general because of social media and dating apps. I find that slightly depressing and scary because you\u2019re constantly aware of presenting yourself, and then your human contact with people becomes very different. I think Connell and Marianne are exemplary examples of not doing that. We shouldn\u2019t forget that sometimes the best place to meet somebody is at a bar rather than over a phone.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0196b03f253d098f360d32a325933dadcb1bfbbc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0196b03f253d098f360d32a325933dadcb1bfbbc/0_284_4284_2572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Mescal as Connell, who plays Gaelic football.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Mescal as Connell, who plays Gaelic football.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Element/Enda Bowe/PA Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Which brings us to the question of anxiety, to which both lovers are prone. \u201cI do feel like anxiety is more prevalent among young people,\u201d admits Edgar-Jones. \u201cI feel more pressure to be living a life according to what I\u2019m exposed to, what I see on social media \u2013 a perfect, positive life. I sometimes feel stressed when I see all my friends hanging out, for example if I\u2019m self-employed and at home with nothing to do. But in a positive way, I\u2019m really grateful to social media and what it\u2019s done to exposing us to different ways of life and different views, allowing us to have bigger dialogues.\u201d</p> <p>Mescal adds: \u201cI think there\u2019s a greater financial pressure on people our age. There\u2019s a likelihood that we will be renting for the vast majority, if not all, of our life. That\u2019s just a shift in society that does lend itself a kind of\u2026 what\u2019s it called? A durability. As millennials, we have built up a durability to just take what comes and make the best of it. We\u2019ve known no different in that sense.\u201d</p> <p>The interview is taking place in London, where both actors are now based, just as social distancing is coming into force. How do they think their generation are going to cope? \u201cI think we are well-equipped \u2013 as well as one can be \u2013 to deal with something like coronavirus because we are constantly used to adapting and compensating and compromising,\u201d says Mescal. \u201cIf anything positive has come out of it for me, looking at everyone back home in Ireland, there\u2019s the opportunity for a strong sense of global community and reflecting on everything that\u2019s difficult together. That\u2019s quite uplifting, because we can become quite isolated and alienated and disenfranchised within our own communities.\u201d</p> <p>One thing that is going to bring many people together is the 12 episodes of <em>Normal People,</em> though such is the devotion to Rooney\u2019s characters that appraisal is likely to devolve to the level of: \u201cWhy does Marianne have a fringe?\u201d The actors agree. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to fit everybody\u2019s idea of them. The only thing that we do have control over is emotionally interrogating them as you would any other character. But we do love Connell and Marianne.\u201d</p> <p><em>The full series of Normal People </em><em>is available on BBC Three from 26<sup> </sup>April. The US Hulu release is on 29 April</em></p>",

Obama was a very controlled person. He would have given you the facts and nothing more. He would have been perfect for this.</p> <p>\u201cRemember the school shooting in Connecticut. Obama did cry, as any human being would after children were killed, but he was still able to speak carefully and in complete sentences. Trump\u2019s briefings are one-third true, one-third misleading and one-third complete gibberish. Can you ever remember Obama speaking gibberish?\u201d</p> <p>Typically in national emergencies, presidents make contact with their predecessors.

Trump, however, has made clear he has no intention of speaking to Obama about the virus because \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to learn much\u201d.</p> <p>But he has frequently sought to blame Obama for the leaving the country unprepared, even though it was Trump who disbanded the national security council\u2019s pandemic preparedness unit. And this week, when Senator Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Democratic primary, he speculated on when Obama will endorse Biden.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why President Obama hasn\u2019t supported Joe Biden a long time ago,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-22/\">Trump told reporters.</a> \u201cThere is something he feels is wrong.

If it does go ahead, Obama and his wife, Michelle, would have a crucial role to play in making Biden\u2019s case, especially to many younger voters who flocked to Sanders in the primary.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.davidlittbooks.com/\">David Litt</a>, a former Obama speechwriter and author of the upcoming Democracy in One Book or Less, said: \u201cBarack Obama is a very good person to introduce Joe Biden to younger voters. There\u2019s an old Bill Clinton saying: sometimes you need someone else to brag on you. Obama is the perfect person to brag on Biden. He can speak to Biden\u2019s abilities as a politician and is more trusted than anyone in the country right now.\u201d</p>",

Money became tight, as did our time. I was made redundant and went back to university. Danny became a landscape gardener, but it\u2019s not exactly lucrative. Before all this, our days would just disappear: cooking, school runs, cleaning, working\u2026</p> <p>By the time Danny got in \u2013 bath and bedtime done \u2013 we\u2019d collapse on the sofa: have you paid the council tax? What\u2019s left in the joint account? Do I need to make you sandwiches tomorrow? Sleep.</p> <p>Things were different when we first got together. We never had high-flying jobs, but our time was free. Now, being in isolation, in our little cocoon, has cut us off from all the outside noise and reminded us why we\u2019ve chosen to build our lives with one another. We\u2019re teaching our son how to play the xylophone and doing silly dances to pirate songs as we jump around in the kitchen. We have space to enjoy the things we did before we became parents: making music, playing Scrabble, dressing up as people from music videos.</p> <p>We\u2019re petrified, too. All Danny\u2019s work has dried up. And we\u2019re both aware things are going to get worse. Here in the country we might be behind London, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not coming. I wake up every day and it\u2019s as if I\u2019ve forgotten what\u2019s happening. When I remember, I can\u2019t help but panic.

I\u2019ve been with Claire for nearly four years, and I decided I wanted to marry her quite early on.</p> <p>She loves the royals and all things historical, so one evening I Googled \u201cWhere was the Queen proposed to?\u201d Turns out it was Balmoral. I got to work putting a plan together and booked a surprise trip to Scotland for 1 April. As the date edged closer, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\" title=\"\">coronavirus</a> situation worsened. I was determined it would happen, but then Balmoral emailed: our visit was off.</p> <p>I had no intention of proposing in the living room when I woke up that morning. Claire was trying (and failing) to use an app to learn how to count to 10 in Italian. I told myself: if she manages to do it, I\u2019ll propose. Eventually she reached 10 \u2013 and I knew what I had to do.</p> <p>I grabbed the ring, but my mind went fuzzy and I started to cry. She pointed out that my flies were undone. Yet, somehow I managed to propose.</p> <p>We called our families as soon as the ring was on her finger and our friends organised drinks on Zoom. Yes, the whole thing is tinged with worry and this wasn\u2019t quite how I\u2019d planned it, but who cares? She said yes.</p> <h2>\u2018Infidelity makes you resourceful\u2019</h2> <p><em>Jack, 48, media technician, southeast England</em></p> <p>I\u2019ve been married 25 years and have had a relationship with another woman for seven. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m proud of, all the deceit and concealment. But you can\u2019t help who you fall in love with. I\u2019ve never wanted to rip apart my family, because there are children involved. To stay or to go, which is kinder? It\u2019s a dilemma that\u2019s more common than you\u2019d think.</p> <p>We both have spouses, but before the lockdown we\u2019d carve out time to speak to and see each other at lunchtimes, in the evenings, whenever. We\u2019ve gone from constant communication and contact to struggling to find enough privacy to send a quick text.</p> <p>We\u2019ve seen each other once since this began, albeit very briefly. She doesn\u2019t live close by, so it took a fair bit of lying. We found a country park and went for a walk, but we couldn\u2019t be long. Disappearing off into different directions for who knows how long has been heartbreaking. We haven\u2019t made a plan to meet again yet, but we will. I know there\u2019s a lockdown, but being in this type of relationship makes you incredibly resourceful.</p> <p>I manage not to dwell too much on what I\u2019m doing when life is busy. We\u2019ve got our routine, which means we can overlook things which cause discomfort. But now we\u2019re all slowing down, you can\u2019t help but think a little more. I\u2019m realising I\u2019m making myself miserable by not being with the person I love, to protect my family. But being stuck in the house, it\u2019s clear my unhappiness is affecting my wife and the children. I\u2019ve been too much of a coward.</p> <p>We discussed leaving our partners at great length a few years ago, but there was always another set of exams, another big date in the diary. Now we\u2019re all staring at our own mortality, and it\u2019s the oldest adage in the book: life is too short. If we get through this, I think we\u2019ll have to make a go of it. If this lockdown lasts a few more weeks I\u2019m sure we can wait, but if it\u2019s six months? I\u2019m not sure I can handle it.</p> <h2>\u2018My flatmate has been relentlessly flirtatious\u2019</h2> <p><em>Ashley, 28, marketing executive, London</em></p> <p>I didn\u2019t think about him in that way at first, when I moved into the flat-share a few weeks back. I heard there was a room going through a friend and, after one of those awkward housemate interviews, I got the call to tell me the place was mine if I wanted it.</p> <p>When we\u2019d chatted over beer, one of the boys had mentioned he was gay and I told him that I was, too. He seemed cool \u2013 quite good looking, clever, sporty \u2013 but I can\u2019t say I fancied him. When I got round to moving my stuff in, he was on holiday. By the time he got back, the new measures had already started. Within a few days, the lockdown was in full swing.</p> <p>From day one of being back he\u2019s been full on: very touchy-feely and relentlessly flirtatious. He makes a point of helping me stretch when we work out together in the garden. He\u2019ll tiptoe up behind me and put his hands on my hips while I cook.</p> <p>\u201cI bet I can guess what you\u2019re about to do,\u201d he jokes when I head alone to my room. \u201cMaybe I can give you a helping hand.\u201d He laughs in a way that hides whether or not he\u2019s joking. I\u2019m pretty certain he\u2019s coming on to me, but it\u2019s impossible to be sure. It\u2019s all insinuation and innuendo.</p> <p>In normal circumstances I wouldn\u2019t hook up with a housemate \u2013 it gets messy. Plus, his room is on one side of the flat, mine on the other. The third housemate is right in between \u2013 getting off with some privacy would be a logistical nightmare. And it\u2019s possible being a tease is just his character. Imagine how awkward it would be to make a move and be rejected. Still, I think a crush is forming, although maybe that\u2019s just because he\u2019s now my only option. The last few times we\u2019ve had a drink our other housemate has gone to bed early leaving just the two of us. We sit very close, hand-touches-leg, eyes meeting momentarily.</p> <p>Next time that happens I think I\u2019ll just go for it \u2013 the prospect of no sex for months outweighs the risk of potential humiliation. Maybe it\u2019ll add a bit of excitement to our newly mundane existence. And, worst case, I can move out when this is all over. It would just be a relief to have something, well someone, to do.</p> <h2>\u2018I couldn\u2019t risk being the one to infect him\u2019</h2> <p><em>Sarah, 58, hospital pharmacist, London</em></p> <p>At first I told my husband to take some obvious precautions: don\u2019t take the tube, wash your hands regularly. Working on the frontline as a pharmacist in a busy London hospital, I\u2019d seen the epidemic developing firsthand.</p> <p>My husband is quite a bit older than me and given my job I\u2019ve always known I might come into contact with coronavirus. I was worried I\u2019d bring it home and I couldn\u2019t stand the thought of being the one to infect him.</p> <p>We talked about him moving out of our home temporarily, although he wasn\u2019t keen. Not just because it seemed a pain, he didn\u2019t want me to worry. Last week I concluded it was for the best, it would make me less paranoid and him \u2013 I hope \u2013 a little safer.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t too hard to arrange. A friend not far away offered him plenty of space. One morning he dropped me off at work, then went to pack his bags. He was gone by the time I arrived home. I\u2019ve kept one of the dogs, he took the others.</p> <p>We haven\u2019t spent more than a few nights apart in our 20 years together. It\u2019s difficult for both of us: he wants to be there to support me as things get worse, but now feels helpless. When I come home after a difficult day, there\u2019s nobody to talk to.</p> <p>In the evenings we catch up, although there isn\u2019t much to say. His days have become repetitive, mine quite depressing. I come home exhausted, feed the dog, eat in front of the TV and then I\u2019m sleeping. Weekends alone feel very strange.</p> <p>What we\u2019re doing isn\u2019t special. I\u2019m sure anyone working in the NHS \u2013 who could \u2013 would do it. Hopefully it\u2019ll all be over before too long, and in a few months we\u2019ll be reunited. It\u2019s just with the weeks stretching out, I don\u2019t know when this might end, or when I might see him. And I already miss having him around.</p> <h2>\u2018My beautiful whirlwind romance is on pause\u2019</h2> <p><em>Juan, 34, photographer, Berlin</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"749cab3f21ebebf261189eccdd16a38b126fc241\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/749cab3f21ebebf261189eccdd16a38b126fc241/27_68_1720_1032/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Juan holding up his camera\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s fair to say I\u2019ve been unlucky in love\u2019: Juan</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Love in the time of COVID-19</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s fair to say I\u2019ve been unlucky in love. Berlin isn\u2019t a city that lends itself to meaningful and long-term relationships. I\u2019m on and off different dating apps; when I\u2019m lonely I click download and then quickly remember why I deleted them. On a rare occasion while swiping a month ago I matched with a guy who was incredibly cute. \u201cOh, what a treat,\u201d I messaged him \u2013 my super-lame opener.</p> <p>We started chatting and right away I could tell there was a spark. We talked as if we\u2019d known each other forever. I normally find it too much to meet up with someone on the first day, but there was something to explore, so we made a plan to meet that night.</p> <p>We grabbed a kebab and walked around the neighbourhood for hours. Everything felt so right: from his Irish accent to his looks and dorky sense of humour. For me the whole evening felt special, something different. We kissed at the end, so I guess he thought it went well, too.</p> <p>From then on the texting was constant. After missing a flight two days later (I went to the wrong airport), I messaged him. He told me to come to his apartment and we cooked dim sum \u2013 already he was there to pick me up when I needed him.</p> <p>After a few more dates I went into voluntary self-isolation. We\u2019ve only met up once since then to walk in the park \u2013 no touching, which was tough \u2013 and now the city is in lockdown. It feels as if this beautiful whirlwind romance is on pause. For the past few weeks I\u2019ve wanted to message him constantly, but I don\u2019t want to overdo it or come across as clingy. I worry that what was developing into something special might stagnate.</p> <p>Today, though, I got a text. He asked if I wanted to take a bike ride next week with him. I said yes immediately. If we\u2019re still allowed to head out, and if it goes well, I might just suggest we bite the bullet and quarantine together for a while. That way there\u2019s no risk it fizzles out, and God knows I could do with the physical contact.</p> <h2>\u2018Our relationship has returned to the internet\u2019</h2> <p><em>Oliver, 14</em><em>,</em> <em>student, Chester</em></p> <p>We met online playing Fortnite nine months ago \u2013 and a week later I asked her out. We\u2019re at the same school and so we\u2019d see each other every day. When the schools closed, I didn\u2019t want to freak her out by making a big deal that this could be the last time I saw her.</p> <p>The other day she walked past my house with her mum, so we talked from each end of the driveway. We usually go to one of our houses after school on Thursday, so we\u2019ve agreed \u2013 for as long as we can \u2013 that\u2019s the day one of us will walk to wave at the other. It\u2019s funny, I met her in a video game and asked her out on Instagram.

As golden wedding anniversaries go, ours ended up a little underwhelming.</p> <p>We\u2019d planned a proper party, but once the government made it clear this was a pandemic and over-70s like us have to stay indoors, we cancelled. Instead, on the day, we had breakfast and wished each other a happy anniversary. I opened up the cards and uploaded some photos from our wedding day to Facebook. As the comments rolled in we reminisced: our honeymoon in Scarborough; the happy days spent with the kids playing in our old family home in Yorkshire.</p> <p>I\u2019ll never forget buying our first LP together: Simon and Garfunkel\u2019s <em>Bridge </em><em>over Troubled Water</em>. I asked our Alexa to play it as we sat on the sofa. We had a listen, although not much of a dance. With two replacement knees and a replacement hip (with another on the way), we can\u2019t move like we used to. My son called and we all toasted with champagne over FaceTime.</p> <p>We\u2019ve made a promise to do it properly once this awful time is over, but it won\u2019t be the same.

He wasn\u2019t responding to my texts and I was worried he\u2019d had another road traffic accident (he wrote off our old car a month earlier), so when my shift ended I used the vehicle tracking software built into the new car to check in on him. I found his car, and watched him leave her apartment block.</p> <p>We got married six years ago in June, but turns out he\u2019d been at it for years. I left our home to stay with friends and family. I needed space to think \u2013 and to work out a plan. Six days later, and still in shock, I got a call: my grandpa had died. I returned from the funeral prepared: we\u2019d divorce and part ways forever. The marriage was over.</p> <p>But just days after touching back down in Texas the pandemic hit. Both people I\u2019d been staying with live in high-risk households, so I couldn\u2019t go back to them. I work in a Covid-designated unit.</p> <p>The problem is that he has nowhere to go \u2013 he\u2019s alienated himself for years \u2013 and I can\u2019t just throw him on to the street in this situation. Once this is over, he\u2019ll be out the door, but I wouldn\u2019t wish the virus on anyone. And anyway, I\u2019d have had to change the locks to kick him out, and I\u2019ve been working so many hours, there\u2019s been no time to make it to the hardware store.</p> <p>So I\u2019m back living in the house with him, constantly drained and exhausted from all the overtime. I\u2019ll talk with him about groceries and how we\u2019re doing for money \u2013 and that is all. I think he knows better than to try and come near me, I can barely look at him. The only time I get alone is walking the dogs, or when I call my counsellor from my car in the driveway. It\u2019s isolating and I\u2019m hurting.</p> <p>I\u2019ve had to go into survival mode. I\u2019m an extrovert by nature, hugs from loved ones are my fix-all. Not being able to be held closely because of the pandemic\u2026 it\u2019s torture. I\u2019m avoiding all unnecessary human contact, keeping clear of all public spaces, just in case I\u2019m a carrier.</p> <p>All I needed was some time \u2013 to sell our house, pay off my student debts, then start afresh \u2013 and instead I\u2019m trapped living with the man who betrayed me.</p> <h2>\u2018At nighttime, the loneliness hits\u2019</h2> <p><em>Amrita, 43, researcher, New Jersey and Sweden</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89482bae8d170f975dc1ef438927b33c9918c377\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89482bae8d170f975dc1ef438927b33c9918c377/0_0_959_1199/800..jpg\" alt=\"Amrita and Christian.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Our wedding had been planned for July \u2013 that\u2019s not happening\u2019: Amrita, with Christian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Love in the time of COVID-19</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In summer 2017 I upped sticks from the US to start my new job in Sweden. A few weeks in \u2013 struggling with the language while ordering a coffee \u2013 a man in the queue behind jumped in to help me. We started talking, he introduced himself as Christian. We\u2019ve been together for two and half years, and he proposed last April.</p> <p>I settled in quickly, but my teenage son missed America. I decided to stay, and he headed home to be with his dad. Since then I\u2019ve been splitting my time between both countries. In early March, I made a trip to the US. Once I arrived, things started to get worse: my speaking engagements were cancelled, my son\u2019s school closed. Then my flight got cancelled. I booked a new one, but when the day came my boy was feeling insecure and I couldn\u2019t leave him. I arranged a new ticket, but the plane never took off.</p> <p>I sometimes wonder if Christian really understands the severity of what it means to live in a state of emergency. Things are different in Sweden: he\u2019s still going to work and can pop out for a walk or to a caf\u00e9 in the evening.</p> <p>Days start in lightness, we send jokey texts. It\u2019s at nighttime, when we\u2019d normally be together, that the choking loneliness hits. Our wedding was planned for July, although now that\u2019s definitely not happening. It breaks my heart to have no idea when I\u2019ll see him again.</p> <h2>\u2018Our relationship has had to mature quickly\u2019</h2> <p><em>Mikayla, 19, student, New Hampshire</em></p> <p>As soon as I met Dalton, I knew I had to convince him we were soulmates. We started college last September and lived in the same halls of residence. At a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders\" title=\"\">Bernie Sanders</a> rally he turned to me and asked: \u201cWhen are we going to stop pretending we aren\u2019t perfect for one another?\u201d It wasn\u2019t until February that we officially got together.</p> <p>It was like being in a movie. The weather was warm and we had all the time in the world ahead of us. Then we got an email: there\u2019s coronavirus in New Hampshire, and you have to go home. My family lives out of state and to get there I\u2019d have to transfer at a busy airport. The last thing I wanted to do was put myself, or others, at risk.</p> <p>I was panicking, but Dalton told me not to worry: I should come home and move in with him and his family. I\u2019d met his dad only briefly and our relationship was a few weeks old.</p> <p>It\u2019s intense what we\u2019re going through, and takes a lot of communication. Our relationship has had to mature really quickly. One of us makes dinner and the other does the dishes. We share a room, so that needs tidying. Groceries need buying. The intrigue of what our future might be like is no longer a romantic mystery. That\u2019s reassuring for both of us \u2013 if we can get through this, we can get through anything. I\u2019ve had strong feelings since the day we met, but seeing Dalton with his family and pets has made me fall even more in love with him. Through this scary time he has become my rock.</p> <h2>\u2018I wonder if we\u2019re being more honest online\u2019</h2> <p><em>Robyn, 30, project co-ordinator, Bristol</em></p> <p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson</a> announced lockdown, I re-downloaded [dating app] Hinge in a panic. A week earlier I\u2019d decided I was done with online dating. I\u2019d try to meet someone in real life. Then my plans were scuppered. It\u2019s weird to be single and know you won\u2019t meet anyone new for ages \u2013 being certain there\u2019ll be no one to be close to as things get worse.</p> <p>Going through the profiles, most of the bios felt irrelevant: you like coffee and going to the gym? Not any more. Already some were adapting to this weird new world. Ideal first date? Quarantine and chill. What do you look for in a partner? No tight chest, cough or high fever.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure what I was looking for. Someone to help me get through this uncertainty? Something to pass the time? Even if I did find someone, it could be months until I ever met them. Surely the novelty would wear off.</p> <p>It was a relief to remember small talk when I started chatting. After speaking with one guy for a while he suggested we have a video date. Not seeing his face, keeping that air of mystery, was exciting. \u201cLet\u2019s have a phone date to start,\u201d I replied. It\u2019s like a quick drink \u2013 you don\u2019t want to commit and there\u2019s potential to build some anticipation.</p> <p>I realised as soon as he rang how much I usually rely on first-date flirtation. How I value smells and touch, and how kindly a potential partner treats strangers. We had to just talk.</p> <p>It lasted an hour, although I didn\u2019t notice. I think we\u2019re ready to progress to video. That throws up a whole load of questions. Eating dinner alone in our respective living rooms feels funny. But drinking? That should help with the nerves. I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m going to dress up. When else am I going to get the chance to wear lipstick in the foreseeable future?</p> <p>I stopped digital dating because it all felt so transient. A place for fun and a quick ego boost, but nothing deeper. I\u2019m not sure if my opinion has changed although we\u2019re in such a state of uncertainty now, I wonder if we\u2019re all being more honest online. There\u2019s no time for bravado and bullshit, none of that matters, and just being fit simply won\u2019t cut it\u2026 I want to know how you\u2019re coping as the world collapses, to hear something real.</p> <p><em>Some names have been changed</em></p>",

  "<p>Collegiate cooperation has been ostentatiously on display this week since Boris Johnson was admitted to hospital. Yet for all the businesslike collaboration in Whitehall, there is no denying a nervousness also lurks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/focus/2020/apr/11/boris-johnsons-darkest-hour-one-week-that-shook-the-nation\">Boris Johnson\u2019s darkest hour: one week that shook the nation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re in a holding pattern at the moment,\u201d said one insider. \u201cWe can get away with it for the time being. But it comes down to how long the PM is going to be out of action \u2013 and when the decision about the next phase [of the Covid-19 response] is going to come down the track.\u201d</p> <p>That nervousness is fuelled not just by Johnson\u2019s absence. It has been aggravated by a crunch of gears, as Downing Street, initially determined to centralise power, has been forced to delegate responsibility at a time of national crisis. And with every passing hour, the elastic connecting Johnson with the actions of his ministers is being stretched.</p> <p>According to officials, the weeks ahead will be about tweaking the dials of the response to the crisis \u2013 dozens of individual decisions that will ultimately dictate everyday life in Britain. And some of those decisions are already looming.</p> <p>In the short term at least, several sources said the machinery of government is working well enough. Even critics of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/dominic-raab\">Dominic Raab</a>, the foreign secretary leading the cabinet in Johnson\u2019s absence, have commended his performance. At the daily 9.15am meeting, now largely a video conference with cabinet ministers hosted from the cabinet room, Raab has reassured the doubters by asking the right questions. As one put it: \u201cThe power has not gone to his head.\u201d In fact, Raab\u2019s approach, according to several allies, is simply to best execute the instructions he knows Johnson has given to the cabinet.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the creation weeks ago of cabinet response sub-committees means that work streams were already in place, with the de facto \u201ccoronavirus quad\u201d of Raab, chancellor Rishi Sunak, health secretary Matt Hancock and cabinet office minister Michael Gove all looking after their own briefs. It also ensured Raab was involved from early on.</p> <p>Even on the most difficult issues, such as testing, personal protective equipment and financial aid, each minister knows the target they have been set. Clashes so far have been relatively minor, including complaints about the quality of the data flowing from the NHS. \u201cI have not felt like I\u2019ve been in a vacuum in the last week,\u201d says one person heavily involved. \u201cWe\u2019ve still had clear steers.\u201d</p> <p>Even with decisions such as whether the length of lockdown should be primarily to protect the economy or to protect lives , the Whitehall reality is currently not so stark. One of the most concerned about the overall health implications of a prolonged lockdown has been Hancock. Treasury officials are also concerned about the damage that a second spike could do if social distancing rules are relaxed too soon.</p> <p>Yet while the governing process has managed to withstand a week without the prime minister, no one doubts this has been the easy part. Trouble lies ahead, as many decisions on the functioning of Britain\u2019s pandemic response speed towards government.</p> <p>Ahead is a period that gives the lie to the idea that the Covid-19 response is dictated by \u201cthe science\u201d, as ministers have been keen to state. Work is under way to examine which lockdown measures are having most and least impact, requiring decisions on what could be dialled up and down.</p> <p>Similar academic studies are looking at the impact on mental health. The effects on health are being examined by both health and Treasury officials. The extent to which people are not using the NHS for serious non-coronavirus issues is also causing concern, requiring decisions on new public communications.</p> <p>Elsewhere, private industry is pressing to fill the gaps in Britain\u2019s ability to make a vaccine should one become available. That could require the government taking big financial risks to build factories that may ultimately be redundant. All these issues, and many more, will require political decisions that will comprise the government\u2019s strategy for the next phase of its coronavirus response. With the peak of the virus expected soon, each day that Johnson is out of action will be crucial.</p> <p>It is an irony not lost on officials that this uncertainty is happening under a No 10 regime initially determined to consolidate power. \u201cWe still have cabinet government, but what\u2019s missing is the political authority of the prime minister,\u201d said Catherine Haddon, senior fellow at the<a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/\"> Institute for Government</a>. \u201cIt is worth remembering that only a few months ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/sajid-javid-resigns-as-chancellor-amid-boris-johnson-reshuffle\">Sajid Javid resigned as chancellor</a> because No 10 and the prime minister seemed to want greater control over the Treasury. So we have a prime minister who was building up his own political power \u2013 in order to do the job he felt needed to be done.\u201d</p> <p>On top of that, officials say a system similar to a Tudor court had emerged in Downing Street. Advisers could argue their case, but only certain figures had Johnson\u2019s ear. However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/dominic-cummings\">Dominic Cummings</a>, Johnson\u2019s controversial senior adviser, has been self-isolating with coronavirus symptoms, and trusted aides Ben Gascoigne and Eddie Lister have also been absent from No 10. According to some, it has focused minds on the question of who is in charge.</p> <p>Suddenly, the apparent strength acquired by No 10 is at risk of becoming a weakness, should the prime minister be absent for weeks to come. As a result, could this experience curb some of the more iconoclastic plans dreamed up by Johnson\u2019s team, such as taking on the civil service? \u201cI think having that institutional expertise, memory and strength now has come in pretty handy,\u201d said one internal critic of those plans. \u201cThere is no energy, bandwidth or money for arbitrary institutional changes. All efforts will have to go into getting the economy on its feet again. Many of the battles that were fought now seem pointless.\u201d</p>",

One third said they spent two hours or more each day on politics. But of these people, four out of five also said that \u201c<em>not one minute of that time</em> is spent on any kind of real political work. It\u2019s all TV news and podcasts \u2026 and social media and cheering and booing and complaining to friends and family.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMore likely than not,\u201d Hersh writes, \u201cif you\u2019re reading this, this book is about <em>you</em>.\u201d</p> <p>I have rarely felt a stronger sense of recognition reading any sentence in any book.</p> <p>Hersh\u2019s strategy to wean us away from the bottomless time waste of social media is to celebrate the power and effectiveness of real activists \u2013 the kind of people who actually spend more of their time in the street, rather than just staring at their phones or computer screens.</p> <p>\u201cIf you feel unfulfilled, melancholy, paralyzed by the sadness of the news and depth of our political problems\u201d, Hersh hopes to intrigue you with \u201ca form of politics where participants get power to improve their communities, present and future\u201d.</p> <p>His first example of a real activist is Lisa Mann, a Brooklyn architect who was inspired to go beyond \u201cbenign pseudo-engagement\u201d and join a group called <a href=\"https://www.ctctogether.org/about-us\">Changing the Conversation</a>, founded by Adam Barbanel-Fried.</p> <p>Mann has pioneered a new form of \u201cdeep canvassing\u201d in which volunteers talk to voters who are likely to oppose their side \u201cand build mutual understanding by listening and taking each person seriously\u201d \u2013 the sort of thing that absolutely never happens on Facebook.</p> <p>Mann undertook 20 canvassing shifts to help turn a New York City congressional district Democratic in 2018, when a war veteran named Max Rose won the usually Republican Staten Island part of the district by just 1,100 votes.</p> <p>As Dionne puts it, \u201cin democracy, persuasion is an imperative.\u201d</p> <p>Both authors point to the huge success of Democrats in retaking the House of Representatives in 2018 as a big reason to be hopeful about the outcome of the presidential election in 2020.</p> <p>Dionne points out the new majority of 2018 \u201cwas the product of the highest mid-term turnout since 1914\u201d \u2013 53.4% of all adults over 18 turned out to vote, while 62% of ballots \u201ccast by those who told exit pollsters that 2018 was their first vote in a midterm election\u201d were for Democrats.</p> <p>Dionne reports that of the 206 \u201cpivot counties\u201d that backed Trump in 2016 after voting twice for Obama, Democrats won 113 back in 2018, and cut Republican victory margins in 71 more.</p> <p>The big problem that Democrats face is an all-out assault on democracy by the Republican party, which began in earnest in 2013 when a conservative majority on the supreme court eviscerated the Voting Right Act of 1965, and Republican state legislatures passed a raft of bills designed to suppress minority voting.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/05/front-row-at-the-trump-show-review-jonathan-karl\">Front Row at the Trump Show review: Jonathan Karl's pre-pandemic warning</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As Trump bluntly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/trump-republican-party-voting-reform-coronavirus\">acknowledged</a> last month, if all eligible voters were permitted to vote, \u201cyou\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again\u201d.</p> <p>The supreme court fired another round in this hideous battle when it refused to extend the deadline for absentee voting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/10/wisconsin-voter-restrictions-democracy-coronavirus-primary\">in last Tuesday\u2019s Wisconsin election</a>, forcing voters to risk their lives by casting their ballots in person during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>At the end of his book, Dionne pinpoints why it is so important to defeat all Republicans in November.

We\u2019re left out here to fend for ourselves, address issues and the customer\u2019s orders as best as we can,\u201d said Solis.</p> <p>Tips have been decreasing, said Solis, thanks to frustrated customers, and there have been issues with tipping on the app. Shipt workers rely significantly on tips to subsidize their pay.</p> <p>The money he makes is \u201cnot enough to compensate for the risk we\u2019re taking and the level of support we have to expel\u201d, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re begging for support right now.

She now receives a priority day once a week where Lyft directs rides to her, equating to about 20 rides for Mitchell. The rest of the week, rides are sparse, but Mitchell is still expected to continue making her car lease payments in addition to living expenses.</p> <p>\u201cThere are no rides. You\u2019re lucky to get one,\u201d said Mitchell. The only day she\u2019s making money is on the one priority day per week she receives from Lyft, and she noted even those have decreased in pay. \u201cBefore the pandemic, I could do 20 rides and make about $10 a ride. Now the rides are about $6 per ride. It should have gone up, not down, because we\u2019re taking a risk.\u201d<br><br>She\u2019s been unable to file for unemployment benefits yet, and Mitchell is concerned that she\u2019ll receive little to no benefits due to the income she is still able to make. Mitchell also explained Lyft is not providing any PPE, and it\u2019s been unavailable in the stores, making it impossible to sanitize her vehicle in between rides.</p> <p>A Lyft spokesperson said in an email the company is working on finding new ways for drivers to earn income, such as delivery partnerships.</p> <h2>Joshua Spence: office janitor in Lubbock, Texas</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eb58cd9fcd816161a233fec7b7da49c7fd86dd11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb58cd9fcd816161a233fec7b7da49c7fd86dd11/0_512_1536_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cEvery time folks go out unnecessarily, we cleaning staff have to work extra hard and hope their carelessness won\u2019t hurt us,\u201d said Joshua Spence, an office janitor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Every time folks go out unnecessarily, we cleaning staff have to work extra hard and hope their carelessness won\u2019t hurt us,\u2019 said Joshua Spence, an office janitor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Joshua Spence</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Through the coronavirus pandemic, Joshua Spence\u2019s work schedule as an office janitor hasn\u2019t changed, nor has his low pay at $8.63 an hour.

At high risk due to his age and diabetes, Anderson has felt uneasy about the crowds at his grocery store in Florida, where Governor Ron DeSantis refrained from <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/01/825383186/florida-governor-orders-statewide-lockdown\">issuing a stay at home order</a> until 1 April. He recently has taken a two-week unpaid leave and will probably extend it through the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cNobody was staying home, so I had to,\u201d said Anderson. \u201cI\u2019m not getting paid, but as I told my manager I\u2019d rather be broke than dead. The people in my area were business as usual. What got to me was families, elderly people, babies, pregnant women, all came shopping. I worked through this past Friday getting more and more stressed, and when I went in last Saturday, every register was open, people lined up, self checkouts full, aisles full and I decided, enough.\u201d</p> <h2>Jessica Hockaday: Instacart shopper for one year in Raleigh, North Carolina</h2> <p>Jessica Hockaday has worked as an Instacart shopper for the past year in Raleigh, North Carolina, but has been unable to work the past few weeks because she has a heart condition \u2013 cardiomyopathy \u2013 and is high risk for Covid-19.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ee92431476af28da7e084eb6803340294d3701b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee92431476af28da7e084eb6803340294d3701b5/0_6_1080_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cIt was either my health or make money,\u201d said Jessica Hockaday of her decision to stop working for Instacart.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It was either my health or make money,\u2019 said Jessica Hockaday of her decision to stop working for Instacart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Jessica Hockaday</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt was either my health or make money,\u201d said Hockaday. \u201cWe just paid our bills yesterday.

While she\u2019s been out of work during the pandemic, Instacart has not provided her with any income. She was ineligible to file for unemployment benefits as Instacart classifies their workers as independent contractors, though she will be eligible under the US Senate\u2019s $2tn <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/politics/coronavirus-stimulus-house-vote/index.html\">stimulus plan</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny they call us independent contractors, but we get in trouble if we decline too many delivery batches.

  "<p>There is a temptation, to which some European governments and politicians are prey, to imagine that Syria\u2019s civil war is over. It would, after all, be politically convenient if the millions of refugees languishing in Turkey and Jordan were to go home, rather than serve as a constant reminder of the EU\u2019s chronic fear of migrants.</p> <p>An end to the war would remove a prime cause of instability in the Levant and eastern Mediterranean region. Russia and Iran would have less excuse to play games of geopolitical chance with civilian lives. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Turkey\u2019s irascible president, would have less to complain about.</p> <p>There was indeed a point, about 18 months ago, when it looked as if Syria\u2019s dictator, Bashar al-Assad, was about to emerge triumphant. Opposition forces, abandoned by the US and their Gulf Arab backers, were fleeing north in disarray. There was talk in Italy of restoring diplomatic relations with Damascus.</p> <p>But instead of the expected, decisive offensive, Russia cut a deal with Erdo\u011fan to create a demilitarised zone in the north-western province of Idlib. Hundreds of thousands of displaced civilians took refuge there. When violence resumed last year, Idlib became a symbol both of resistance and extreme regime brutality.</p> <p>Idlib is the subject of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/07/syria-shoddy-ceasefire-idlib--war-suffering-syrians-erdogan-putin-russia-turkey\">another ceasefire</a>.

On two occasions, <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/04/1061402\">Syrian fighter jets dropped sarin gas</a>, a nerve agent, making dozens ill. In another attack, a helicopter dropped a cylinder containing chlorine through the roof of the hospital.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.opcw.org/media-centre/news/2020/04/opcw-releases-first-report-investigation-and-identification-team\">OPCW</a> has frequently ascertained illegal use of chemical weapons in Syria, but never before has it assigned blame or named the culprits. Last week\u2019s comprehensive report based its findings on witness testimony, medical records and satellite imagery.</p> <p>It was completed despite the refusal of the Syrian regime to co-operate and a ban on investigators visiting the village. Russia has often hindered the OPCW\u2019s work, too, not least through the repeated use of its UN security council veto and cynical disinformation campaigns.</p> <p>Only days after the Ltamenah attacks, another regime chemical weapons assault on a nearby town, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/06/the-dead-were-wherever-you-looked-inside-syrian-town-after-chemical-attack\">Khan Sheikhun</a>, killed 89 people. The atrocity prompted the US to fire cruise missiles at military sites. But the strikes did not stop Assad launching more chemical attacks.</p> <p>The OPCW\u2019s detailed, factual proofs have finally put Assad on the spot. While similar, additional investigations are in train, this report as it stands is sufficient to warrant swift action by the UN and the <a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/cwcsig\">CWC\u2019s 193 state parties</a> to bring the accused to book and exact justice for their crimes.</p> <p>Given past form, the chances this will happen soon or at all are slim. Predictably, the US welcomed the report and took the opportunity to criticise Russia and Iran. The EU said it might consider additional sanctions. And the regime flatly rejected the findings, calling them \u201cfalsified and fabricated\u201d. No change there.</p> <p>It would be nice to be wrong. Perhaps the international community, having ducked its responsibilities for so long, will at last summon the will to put the regime\u2019s butchers on trial, in absentia if need be, for Ltamenah and the many other war crimes they have committed. Assad must not be allowed to win.</p>",
  "<p>For the <em>Observer Magazine</em> of 9 September 1973, the legendary theatre critic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kenneth-tynan\" title=\"\">Kenneth Tynan</a> turned his attention to the comic genius of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/gallery/2019/nov/08/eric-morecambe-rarely-seen-photos-of-the-comedy-legend\" title=\"\">Eric Morecambe</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/mar/22/stuartmillar2\" title=\"\">Ernie Wise</a> as they celebrated their 30th anniversary as a double act.</p> <p>Tynan argued that they were at the point where \u2018sheer professional skill, raised to the highest degree by the refining drudgery of constant practice, evolves into something different in kind, conferring on its possessors an assurance that enables them to take off, to ignore, to achieve outrageous feats of timing and audience control.\u2019</p> <p>But it was Morecambe\u2019s mastery he focused on: \u2018Eric in particular has burgeoned into one of the most richly quirkish and hypnotic performers in the history of the box.\u2019 And \u2013 referring to the famous sketch in which Morecambe says he\u2019s playing the right notes \u2018but not necessarily in the right order\u2019 \u2013 \u2018He can even bully Andr\u00e9 Previn and the London Philharmonic.\u2019</p> <p>He marvelled at Morecambe\u2019s reflexes, which were \u2018among the wonders of the profession. He can modulate through a series like alarm/aggression/collapse/recovery/snide insinuation in about four seconds.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Ernie is the classic stooge, dapper and aggressive\u2026 Eric is the comic off whose foolishness Ernie scores,\u2019 he wrote. \u2018Huge black horn rims are a vital part of his persona. They highlight\u2026 the look of suddenly dawning enlightenment, the blank stare aimed straight at the camera, the smug oeillade that accompanies asides like: \u201cThis boy is a fool.\u201d\u2019</p> <p>Tynan argued that they \u2018actually improved on the way from the variety stage to the small screen\u2019 and noted how they had become \u2018two egotists in\u2026 equal competition\u2019 rather than simply comic and stooge. \u2018Ernie today is the comic <em>who is not funny</em>. And Eric\u2026 is the straight man <em>who is funny</em>. The combination is brilliant, wholly original and irresistible.\u2019 </p>",

Bezos\u2019s $100m, for example, amounts to about 11 days of his income.</p> <p>Well-publicized philanthropy also conveniently distracts attention from how several of these billionaires are endangering their workers and, by extension, the public.</p> <p>With online sales surging, Amazon is on a hiring binge. But Bezos still doesn\u2019t provide sick leave for workers unless they test positive for Covid-19, in which case they get just two weeks. On 20 March, four senators sent him a letter expressing concern that the company wasn\u2019t doing enough <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/07/amazon-warehouse-workers-coronavirus-safety\">to protect its warehouse workers</a>.</p> <p>Walmart\u2019s booming sales have caused it to hire more than 100,000 workers over the past three weeks. But the firm failed to implement social distancing for two weeks after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced guidelines on 16 March. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/06/walmart-workers-coronavirus-die-illinois-evergreen-park\">Several workers have died</a>. Most still don\u2019t have access to gloves, masks or hand sanitizer. They don\u2019t get paid sick leave, not even at stores where employees have contracted the virus.</p> <p>Musk initially dismissed sheltering as \u201cdumb\u201d and defied a sheriff\u2019s order to shelter-in-place by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/19/elon-musk-coronavirus-tesla-factory-california\">keeping open Tesla\u2019s factory in Fremont, California</a>, telling employees the factory was an \u201cessential\u201d business.</p> <p>The third way conspicuous philanthropy is self-serving is by suggesting that government shouldn\u2019t demand more from the super-rich, even in a national emergency. As Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Wall Street Journal editorial page put it, if we had a wealth tax like Elizabeth Warren proposed, \u201cit\u2019s unlikely [Bill Gates] would have the capacity to act this boldly.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s absurd.

How does the Journal<em> </em>believe we\u2019re going to pay down this added national debt if the wealthiest among us don\u2019t pay more taxes? Even when this nightmare is over, most Americans will be hard pressed.</p> <p>And why should we believe that Gates or any other billionaire\u2019s \u201cboldness\u201d necessarily reflects society\u2019s values and needs? Oligarchies aren\u2019t the same as democracies.</p> <p>The worst fear of the billionaire class is that the government\u2019s response to the pandemic will lead to a permanently larger social safety net.</p> <p>\u201cOnce the virus is conquered \u2013 and it will be \u2013 the biggest risk will be the political campaign to expand government control over far more of American economic life,\u201d warns Murdoch\u2019s Journal<em>.</em></p> <p>After all, the Great Depression of the 1930s spawned social security and the minimum wage, as well as a widespread conviction that government should guarantee a minimum standard of living. The second world war yielded the GI Bill and then the National Defense Education Act, enshrining the government\u2019s role as a financier of higher education.</p> <p>Even programs that don\u2019t enjoy wide popularity when first introduced, such as the Affordable Care Act, enlarge the nation\u2019s sense of what is reasonable for the government to do for its citizens. The ACA lives on, more popular than ever, notwithstanding the GOP\u2019s determination to repeal it and Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to undermine it.</p> <p>As the pandemic challenges the security and safety of all Americans, some conservative politicians are proposing things that would have been unthinkable \u2013 certainly unspeakable \u2013 only months ago.</p> <p>The Missouri Republican senator Josh Hawley is calling for the federal government to \u201ccover 80% of wages for workers at any US business, up to the national median wage\u201d until the crisis is over.</p> <p>\u201cWorkers will benefit from the steady paycheck and the knowledge their jobs are safe,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Indeed. Hawley\u2019s logic would as easily justify national paid sick leave and universal basic income, permanently.</p> <p>If the pandemic has revealed anything, it\u2019s that America\u2019s current social safety net and healthcare system does not protect the majority of Americans in a national emergency.

  "<p>For a while when the coronavirus first hit Australia, the main concern was apparently for professional sport. Footy might die, was the summation from the suits in charge. Footy could mean any code, take your pick. In a country shut down, the empty streets meant empty grandstands, empty changerooms, empty training fields. Any game that ceased its frantic treadmill would cease to exist. Forget planning for the other side of the crisis, there was no other side to reach.</p> <p>It\u2019s April now and in the south the weather has started to turn, interspersing an hour of sun on yellow maple leaves or early wattle blossom with the first cold fronts lashing the Victorian coast. My mind and my year should be turning to football, deep enough into the season to start worrying about an early trend, a half-back\u2019s ankle, a road trip coming up.</p> <p>I\u2019m not thinking about it at all, though. Except for this moment of thinking about what I\u2019m not thinking about. I\u2019m thinking about friends cooped up and going mad, about creative fervour, about depressive dead ends, about the chasm between safe and unsafe shelter, about using the internet to make a sparse few people smile. I\u2019m thinking about loving New York City, and about how it\u2019s a ghost town now in every sense. I\u2019m thinking about the cigarettes and plazas of Spain and Italy, and what came of them. I\u2019m thinking about the placid blank of China\u2019s information firewall, and the futility of reporting numbers from India when millions of its residents don\u2019t have their existence acknowledged at all.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/04/coronavirus-shutdown-has-left-a-hollowness-in-the-life-of-this-afl-fan\">Coronavirus shutdown has left a hollowness in the life of this AFL fan | Paul Daley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For those not facing eviction or infection, with enough space that isolation isn\u2019t a prison, the quietness has its good side. There\u2019s no anxiety about whether three wins in a row means my team is bound to crash, or three losses in a row means we\u2019re so behind we can\u2019t get back. If footy were here we would be saturated with it, life and death on the talkback line, breathless punditry about the Doggies\u2019 defence and which Instagram post was disrespectful and which coach would be first sacked, before debating some attention-seeking deadshittery from a former player whose new job description is to be an attention-seeking deadshit. I don\u2019t look out my window at the sun on the foliage and think that my world is missing football. I look out the window and feel still.</p> <p>Perhaps more of us than expected aren\u2019t missing it that much. Perhaps football is habit, ceaselessly reinforced by those whose lives are devoted to pushing it. A mate in Ballarat messaged me while contemplating its main oval. \u201cThe amount of man hours that go into it is astonishing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHuge amounts of money and fertiliser. Endless gazing and discussion.\u201d He wondered what custodians across the world would do with a long-term chance to tend their battered turf.

Not just those whose jobs are gone, those for whom sport forms a more central part of their life or sense of self. But the pro leagues that demand all the attention are not the major loss. All social sport is cancelled, every clubhouse empty, every ledger heading closer to oblivion. Losing this hurts more: all the people for whom their local club is one of the points that life coheres around, whether as players or members. Their chance to see friendly faces, swap stories, be part of something that is at once safely familiar but sufficiently bigger than themselves.</p> <p>If this loss were to continue through the Australian winter, into the next spring, the sense of sadness would grow alongside. All the in-built brick barbecues abandoned as the weather swings upward, the grounds trod fleetingly by a few runners for their police-approved daily exercise. The small cricket clubs toppling after the footy clubs.</p> <p>Whatever happens on the far side, professional sport can\u2019t come back pretending it\u2019s as important as when it left. We\u2019ve seen a world without it. Premier League clubs that have sacked their staff and taken public money can\u2019t throw around transfer bonuses when the grift-mill starts again. Clubs in a global recession can\u2019t pay a defensive midfielder \u00a3300,000 a week. Australian codes can\u2019t pretend that the season is sacrosanct, that the One Day in September or the opening round or the State of Origin may not be trifled with. Nature doesn\u2019t give a fuck about Wally Lewis.</p> <p>To be clear, though, when the administrators say that their sport might die, they really mean their administrations might die. That\u2019s their worry. When you look around the sporting landscape, you wonder if that would be such a bad thing after all. Most of the organisations right now are exactly as they were. The National Rugby League is a bloviating mess. Football Federation Australia is hanging on by its fingernails. Rugby Australia has already let go.

told reporters in Canberra there \u201cis no place in the world I would rather be than Australia at the moment\u201d but we should not be \u201ccomplacent\u201d due to ongoing community

newsletter</a></figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the rolling average of new case numbers below 2% for five consecutive days, states including Western Australia and New South Wales have already begun to suggest restrictions could be eased.</p> <p>The NSW chief medical officer, Kerry Chant, has suggested a \u201czigzag\u201d approach that could see restrictions on going outdoors for non-essential purposes eased on a trial basis then reinstated if case numbers increase.</p> <p>Murphy noted that \u201caround the world [countries] have released restrictions and have had to reimpose them\u201d and said national cabinet would not lift restrictions until there are measures including surveillance and tracking to ensure case numbers stayed under control.</p> <p>\u201cBut there is a huge risk in doing so and we have certainly said that it is not the right time now.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier, Frydenberg told Insiders it was \u201cvery dangerous and unrealistic to move ahead of the medical advice\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAs the prime minister has said, patience is a virtue, and complacency is a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd everyone needs to understand that this is a very fluid and difficult situation.\u201d</p> <p>Frydenberg noted that Scott Morrison had \u201cprepared the nation for six months at least\u201d of Covid-19 restrictions and would not predict if they could be lifted sooner.</p> <p>\u201cAgain, I don\u2019t have a crystal ball \u2026 We are having a degree of success in flattening out that curve.\u201d</p> <p>Frydenberg said he believed Australia would suffer a \u201csignificant increase in unemployment\u201d due to the \u201csevere economic impact of health restrictions\u201d but business leaders understood the need to follow the medical advice.</p> <p>Frydenberg revealed that 802,000 businesses had applied to access the jobkeeper wage subsidy for millions of employees, while more than 600,000 workers had applied for early access to their superannuation on the basis of financial hardship.</p> <p>He suggested the number of those wanting access to super may shrink, as many had expressed interest before the $130bn wage subsidy program was announced and passed parliament.</p> <p>The treasurer said the government had \u201cno plans\u201d to expand eligibility for the $1,500 fortnightly payment, explaining that a discretion for him to do so without recalling parliament was designed for \u201cunforeseen circumstances\u201d.</p> <p>The Australian Council of Trade Unions and Labor have cited the treasurer\u2019s discretion as the basis for an ongoing campaign for one million casuals with less than 12 months service with their current employer and 1.1 million temporary visa workers to get the payment.</p> <p>Frydenberg revealed it would cost $18bn to add one million casuals to the program, but insisted he intended to use his discretion only \u201cif you needed to implement [the program] in a different way with the [Australian Tax Office]\u201d if issues arose in the implementation phase.</p> <p>Frydenberg said shorter-term Australian casual workers would be eligible for the $1,100 fortnightly jobseeker payment instead, while temporary visa-holders could access their superannuation, continue to work or return home.</p> <p>\u201cAt $130bn \u2026 we had to draw the line somewhere. This is a massive call on the public purse and it is a debt that the country will pay for years to come and at six million people on the jobkeeper program, that\u2019s nearly half the Australian workforce.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if tax increases would be needed to pay back fresh debt, Frydenberg replied that \u201cit will be paid back in the years ahead\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBut, again, we approach this crisis with about a quarter of the debt to GDP ratio of the US, of the UK, and about one seventh of what it is in Japan.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/11/utterly-unjust-why-australian-renters-and-their-landlords-need-certainty-on-residential-tenancies\">'Utterly unjust': why Australian renters and their landlords need certainty on residential tenancies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe way to meet that growing debt burden will be to grow the economy.\u201d</p> <p>Frydenberg said the Liberal party is \u201cthe party of lower tax\u201d and claimed its track record showed it could restrain government spending. \u201cWe are going to have to climb that mountain again.\u201d</p> <p>Frydenberg talked tough about the need to fight Covid-19, which he described as a \u201cfaceless and flagless enemy\u201d but warned that \u2013 despite the prime minister\u2019s call to protect Australia\u2019s sovereignty \u2013 the current crisis is \u201cnot an argument for protectionism\u201d.</p> <p>Earlier, McCormack said \u201cthe recovery out the other side is going to need that [tax reform]\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI think the expenditure review committee and the states will be having a large say in that,\u201d he told Sky News.</p> <p>McCormack claimed the Coalition knew how to \u201cmanage money\u201d but said the federal government would \u201cneed the help of Labor states and territories, through the [Council of Australian Governments] process and the national cabinet being its best self\u201d to manage tax reform.</p> <p>On Sunday the education minister, Dan Tehan, guaranteed that the federal government will pay $18bn in commonwealth grant scheme funding to universities this year regardless of whether they meet the student numbers estimated at the time of the 2019 budget.</p>",

His office said he was improving and was back on his feet although his recovery was still at an early stage. <br><br>Britain imposed a lockdown three weeks ago in a bid to curb the spread of the virus and the government has come under increasing pressure to detail how long the strict measures on movements would last, with people forced to stay at home and many businesses unable to operate. <br><br>Ministers have said Britain needed to pass the peak of the outbreak before changes could be made, and Hancock said although the number of hospital admissions had started to flatten out, there was not enough evidence yet to have confidence they were past the worst. <br><br>\u201cOur judgement is we\u2019re not there yet. We haven\u2019t seen a flattening enough to be able to say that we\u2019ve reached the peak,\u201d he told BBC radio. <br><br>Some scientists have suggested the peak might still be some weeks off but Hancock said \u201cnobody knows\u201d when it would be. <br><br>\u201cThere\u2019s all sorts of suggestions. Their job is to make their best estimate and advise us and we have a whole load of different pieces of advice from different scientists,\u201d he said. <br><br>The death rate is also expected to increase over the next few days, health officials have cautioned, but they say they are hopeful that the lockdown will mean that the overall number of deaths will be below 20,000. <br><br>Initially Johnson took a more modest response to the outbreak than other European leaders but changed tack when projections suggested a quarter of a million people could die in the United Kingdom. <br><br>The government has come under fire for its initial response and a lack of preparedness, and there was criticism on Saturday from doctors and nurses who said they were having to treat patients without proper personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks and gloves. <br><br>Among those to have died after testing positive for COVID-19 are 19 health care workers including 11 doctors. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e917c4b8f08db3109f20a5e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarah-marsh\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-11T08:15:35.026Z\">9.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Hello all.
