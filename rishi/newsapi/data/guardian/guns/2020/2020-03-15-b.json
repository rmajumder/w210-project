  "<p>Julian Fellowes has been typing again. It is the year flimpty plomp, the pasteenth century in days of yore. There are worried English people in Brussels and a French war person, Napoleon Bonaparte \u2013 \u201cBoney\u201d, as people would period-specifically call him; you can check in books! \u2013 is making them worry Englishly. But the Lady Duke of Richmond is holding a ball, to show that she has a period-specific ballroom and won\u2019t be intimidated by French war people, no she will not!</p> <p>Philip Glenister is James Trenchard, a trenchant trencherman and victualler \u2013 which is pronounced \u2018vittler\u2019 \u2013 to the English soldiers who are stationed in Brussels in case Boney tries any of his French warring. To the chagrin (\u201cshame and embarrassment\u201d across La Manche) of his slightly better-born wife, Anne (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tamsin-greig\" title=\"\">Tamsin Greig</a>), James has wangled invitations to the lady duke\u2019s ball, despite being born to a family of tubers in Covent Garden before he became a successful merchant potato in Frenchland. He is also ignorant-potatoely encouraging his daughter Sophia in her flirtation with the duchess\u2019s nephew, Edmund, Lord Bellasis (Jeremy Neumark Jones), even though she is, of course, half-potato and he cannot marry for love, no matter how much he wants a plate of chips.</p> <p>All clear so far? Frenchies! Englisheses! Balls! Great! The ball begins, even though Anne \u201cMaris Piper\u201d Trenchard has said: \u201cHow strange that we should be having a ball when we are on the brink of war!\u201d Anyone who is anyone is there, especially if they are the Duke of Wellington or the Prince of Orange (\u201cTop Dutchman! Feel m\u2019clogs!\u201d). The Lady Duke of Richmond is enchanting, Anne is mortified and everyone manages to keep a straight face during the sword-dancing display.</p> <p>All is going swimmingly, although Sophia professes to Edmund that she is a bit worried about the Wikipedia entry she read before about Boney\u2019s advance before getting into her unbecoming but period-specific ballgown, and the possibility of this becoming the most famous ball in history, when Wellington is notified by a messenger that Boney \u2013 Napoleon Bonaparte \u2013 has unexpectedly arrived at the nearby strategic crossroads of Quatre Bras, which is French for Four Somethings. But Edmund tells her: \u201cDon\u2019t be silly, my little Jersey Royal! Nothing can happen to us! We\u2019re the luckiest couple alive!\u201d Sophia is relieved. \u201cAnd the most in love!\u201d she replies. No, she really does.</p> <p>Alas, alack, a message <em>is</em> delivered to Wellington. It <em>does</em> say that the Bonester is at the strategic crossroads of Quatre Bras. Sacr\u00e9 bleu \u2013 or, more patriotically, crumbs! Everyone who has a penis, is wearing a red jacket, and is not one of the sword dancers gathers in the Man Duke of Richmond\u2019s study to pore over a parchment map and note that, if they don\u2019t stop French war man at Four Somethings, they may have to do battle nearby at \u2026 Where-a-loo? What-a-loo? Waterloo!</p> <p>Crikey. I hope we win. Off they go \u2013 Wellers, Orangey and, sad to say, young Eddie. Sophia is distraught. Also, they need a victualler, pronounced vittler, so James heads off, too. He comes back from his first battlefield a broken man \u2013 and no wonder. \u201cA very awful sight it was, too,\u201d he tells Anne while staring into the middle distance, possibly at his agent, whom I imagine is standing with everyone else\u2019s in the wings urging them to think of Maggie Smith\u2019s pension and stagger on. \u201cBodies everywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cGroans from the wounded. Scavengers\u201d \u2013 you can practically see the beads of sweat that must have formed on Fellowes\u2019 brow as he dug deep to recreate the hellish scene for viewers \u2013 \u201cpicking at the corpses!\u201d</p> <p>Not only that, but Edmund was killed, quite dead, fatally too. James breaks the news to his baby new potato that her bit of fancy steak has had his frites. She is distraught again.</p> <p>SMASH CUT to 26 years later. Afternoon tea has been invented, Sophia is dead, the titular London district of Belgravia has been built (by James, in partnership with Thomas Cubitt, dontcha know) and the script is even worse. Once we are ensconced with the Trenchards in their townhouse, we are introduced to the servants and all pretence that this is not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/downton-abbey-episode-by-episode\" title=\"\">Downton Abbey</a> \u2013 in, uh, Belgravia \u2013 collapses.

The House then passed a sweeping relief bill, backed by Trump and negotiated by Mnuchin and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, which is expected to pass the Senate on Monday.</p> <p>But Cohn argued on Friday that the spread of Covid-19 had already \u201ccurtailed consumer demand\u201d and that it was \u201cmost likely \u2026 we are already in a recession\u201d, a view shared by experts including Barack Obama\u2019s former top economic adviser, Jason Furman. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-could-expose-the-hollowness-of-americas-boom\">On Friday</a>, he said that \u201cat this point, this feels much worse than 2008\u201d, the last global financial crisis.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html\">latest numbers</a> from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which have not been updated since Friday, document 1,629 confirmed US cases of Covid-19, with 41 fatalities. Other estimates are higher and most experts think thousands of cases have not been diagnosed, in part because of a slow start to testing.</p> <p>Mnuchin\u2019s confidence in the economy came in the face of state and local leaders mandating policy designed to limit exposure to the virus.

  "<p>The public health response to a serious epidemic is laid out simply and clearly by the World Health Organization (WHO). Test intensively, trace contacts, quarantine and maintain social distancing. When Covid-19 got out of control in Wuhan, after three weeks of public health inaction, the Chinese authorities mounted a proper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/03/more-surveillance-tighter-controls-chinas-coronavirus-crackdown\" title=\"\">campaign to control the virus</a>. They listened to the WHO. They tested extensively, setting up mobile testing centres, and getting the test result time down from four days to four hours. They cut the time from onset of symptoms to lab result from 12 to three days. They identified family clusters (the virus spreads mainly through extended close contact so family members are most at risk) and arranged isolation centres for contacts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/uk-coronavirus-cases-how-many-are-in-your-area\">Coronavirus UK cases: find out how many are in your area</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Above all, they mobilised communities. They didn\u2019t leave it all to messages and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2017/feb/22/nudge-theory-the-psychology-and-ethics-of-persuasion-science-weekly-podcast\" title=\"\">nudge behavioural methods</a>. Yes, Wuhan was in lockdown, but across the country local authorities had high autonomy to help people abide by these best public health principles. This was not a terrorised population but one passionate about tackling an existential threat. They also used apps and smartphones to get messages across, to share information about local clusters and for data collection. Everyone in Wuhan, a city of 11 million, ordered their food online, and had it delivered. And the strategy worked. In seven weeks China <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/how-did-china-get-grips-with-coronavirus-outbreak\" title=\"\">stopped the epidemic</a> in its tracks. It now reports only 10 to 20 new cases per day in a population of nearly 1.4 billion. Deaths have plummeted. Several other countries, including South Korea, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan, have copied this strategy, with local modifications, with similar results.</p> <p>Now they realise they must face the challenge of how to loosen up, and whether allowing the economy to recover will lead to more outbreaks, but they have a nationwide system to jump on new clusters and outbreaks to keep this under control. The aim is to wait and hope for drugs and vaccines to emerge in the next 12 months to enable them to treat cases and to build proper herd immunity from a vaccine.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Won\u2019t this strategy ensure that the spread of the virus is intense and will cause more infections and more deaths in the near term?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I had assumed that the UK would do the same, that the authorities would be building their resources and plans around nationwide testing, contact tracing, quarantine and a progressive policy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-and-social-distancing-is-it-risky-to-go-to-the-pub-or-gym\" title=\"\">social distancing</a>. I assumed they would inform the public they had a two- to three-month \u201ccontain and delay\u201d strategy to get the epidemic under control, and mobilise communities everywhere to provide local support. But from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/13/johnson-urges-top-uk-tech-firms-to-join-coronavirus-fight\" title=\"\">press conferences last week</a>, the government is not following the WHO strategy. They appear to have concluded that it is inevitable most people would get the disease, so we should let the epidemic proceed to allow 60% of the population to become infected and build herd immunity through the wild virus. What is the scientific justification for this departure from WHO policy? I have questions:</p> <p>Why have they abandoned population testing and contact tracing to identify and seclude clusters of infections? They recommend only testing cases in hospital. Won\u2019t this strategy ensure that the spread of the virus is intense and will cause more infections and more deaths in the near term?</p> <p>Why do they recommend self-isolation only for people with symptoms when Maria Van Kerkhove of the WHO reports that \u201cit seems that people shed more virus in the early phases rather than the late phases of disease\u201d? Asymptomatic contacts may be highly infectious, so they should be tested, isolated and followed up in the community. Will they set up quarantine centres to help those who have no family support or are homeless, or need social care?</p> <p>What are their plans for national, district, municipal, village and community mobilisation? \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/why-is-the-government-relying-on-nudge-theory-to-tackle-coronavirus\" title=\"\">Nudge</a>\u201d is not enough. We need to devolve power and autonomy to allow locally intelligent decisions around a coherent national strategy. What is their detailed strategy for screening of infected people in the home, and provision of CT scans for those with early signs of pneumonia and to identify those at high risk? Without an all-out national mobilisation for social distancing, are the behavioural and nudge strategies really evidence-based to flatten the peak? Or simply based on models?</p> <p>Why are we emphasising herd immunity now? Does coronavirus induce strong herd immunity or is it like flu, where immunity remains weak and new strains emerge each year? We have much to learn about Covid-19 immune responses. Doesn\u2019t this contradict WHO policy? Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, said after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/who-declares-coronavirus-pandemic\" title=\"\">declaring a pandemic</a>: \u201cThe idea that countries should shift from containment to mitigation is wrong and dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>Shouldn\u2019t we wait to see the China situation? They have contained the epidemic after seven weeks of intensive national effort. Will epidemics break out again in new states? Maybe. Will their strengthened systems not contain them quickly and effectively? What is their herd immunity to date? We don\u2019t have the data available but new tests are coming online. It might be substantial, without a massive epidemic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c41496f193067b5f70035a03c8dbdd99dfe3ed4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c41496f193067b5f70035a03c8dbdd99dfe3ed4d/0_282_6356_3814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman in Beijing has her temperature checked before entering a shopping mall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Shouldn\u2019t we wait to see the China situation?

Is it wise or ethical to adopt a policy that threatens immediate casualties on the basis of uncertain future benefit?</p> <p>What is the policy to promote social distancing? How can we promote advice for families, mass gatherings, schools, workplaces, restaurants, theatres? And can we make it locally relevant? School closures might be phased depending on the intensity of transmission based on local data about clusters, as they did in Singapore.

It will go a long way to ensure the success of the \u2018delay\u2019 phase of the government\u2019s strategy. It could save tens of thousands of lives because it will ensure good decision-making, and good decision-making by individuals is central to how we manage this crisis,\u201d Patel said in a commentary published by the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cImagine the scene if examinations were to proceed as normal.

  "<p>The Iranian ambassador to the UK says the British government is taking a new approach to the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, adding bilateral talks were taking place over the payment of an outstanding \u00a3400m debt owed by the UK to Iran.</p> <p>Hamid Baeidinejad said the two sides were looking at novel ways for the debt to be paid.</p> <p>It is the first time a UK or Iranian official has admitted in public that talks on the matter are underway, including the possibility of the debt being paid off through medicines and humanitarian goods.</p> <p>Neither side will openly acknowledge there is a link between the debt and the retention of the British-Iranian dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe in jail. She was sentenced to five years on spying charges in 2016, a charge she has always denied.</p> <p>Interviewed by the Iranian newspaper Etemad, Baeidinejad said the previous UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, had taken a counter-productive, aggressive approach to the issue of Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s release, but Boris Johnson\u2019s new government was adopting a different line.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIn Britain media and public opinion were engaged because of her being a mother with a young child. The ministry of foreign affairs of Iran has also relayed this media and psychological atmosphere to the country\u2019s judicial system. But it is up to the judiciary to decide whether or not to release her.</p> <p>\u201cAs we know, classes of prisoners who spend half their time in prison can be subject to reduced sentences.

Similarly, the pervasive US sanctions make it difficult to make a payment to Iran\u2019s central bank.</p> <p>Baeidinejad added: \u201cThe legal process of this long-running case, which has been going on for more than 50 years, is nearing its end. The court has ordered the British government to pay the Iranian debt plus interest, and this cannot be changed. At the same time, the opposing lawyers have tried to use every legal opportunity to delay the practical execution of the court\u2019s decision.\u201d</p> <p>He said: \u201cIt is natural to come up with ideas for the type of payment as the time comes to pay off the debt, given the complexities and banking problems. The Islamic Republic of Iran also has ideas for expediting the debt. Finalising the payment method requires a mutual agreement, and talks are underway to determine the details of how the agreements will be implemented.\u201d</p> <p>Separately, Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s family are still pressing the Tehran prison authorities to allow her to be released temporarily due to the threat of coronavirus spreading through Iran\u2019s jails.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of prisoners have been released, but few political or security prisoners have been allowed out on bail.</p>",
  "<p>Toni Morrison knew a thing or two about stories. In 1994 she saw the \u201cpolitical correctness debate\u201d as being about \u201cthe power to be able to define. The definers want the power to name. And the defined are now taking that power away from them.\u201d The actor John Boyega is the latest to empower the previously mute. Last week his production company said it had <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/john-boyega-netflix-african-films_n_5e67db8cc5b60557280caf6d?ri18n=true%0D\" title=\"\">signed a deal</a> with streaming giant Netflix to develop non-English language films from parts of Africa, initially focused on Nigerian and Sudanese work. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we take charge of telling our stories, and with this deal, we will do just that,\u201d wrote the actor, of British-Nigerian heritage.</p> <p>His mission chimes with the brilliant Belarusian writer Svetlana Alexievich\u2019s recent <a href=\"https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/01/14/belarussian-writer-alexievich-starts-all-women-publishing-house-a68892\" title=\"\">announcement</a> that she will launch a publishing house specifically for other female authors this year (\u201cMen, they are everywhere, and women\u2019s works are rarely published,\u201d she told the Nasha Niva website). Stormzy, having already founded a record label, joined Penguin Random House to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/16/turning-a-new-page-the-rise-of-merky-books\" title=\"\">launch the #Merky imprint</a>: the only prerequisite for the titles it publishes are that the authors are \u201cfrom under-represented communities\u201d. Similarly, the novelist Nikesh Shukla co-founded the <a href=\"https://www.thegoodliteraryagency.org/\" title=\"\">Good Literary Agency</a> for talent that otherwise might be excluded.</p> <p>The shift from creating content to encouraging and amplifying the voice of others is not a new one. It isn\u2019t surprising that those who love films, books or music enough to devote their lives to making them would want to ensure that the world has more of the best. The Beatles used their Apple label to release the likes of Mary Hopkin. </p> <p>What\u2019s striking about the recent initiatives is that they are not only sharing work they appreciate, but are explicitly promoting the work of people who have been marginalised or ignored by industry gatekeepers. They are not only fostering talent, but recognising it, even when it comes in forms that might seem unfamiliar to others. Cultural production is still dominated by a very narrow sector of society, whose dominance has arguably increased in recent years. A 2018 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/apr/16/arts-industry-report-asks-where-are-all-the-working-class-people\" title=\"\">report concluded that</a> people with working-class origins are still underrepresented in the arts, and that the people at the top (mostly middle-class white men) were the most attached to the idea that the creative industries are a meritocracy.</p> <p>The question is not only who we get to see or hear, but what stories we are told. Research <a href=\"https://clpe.org.uk/library-and-resources/research/reflecting-realities-survey-ethnic-representation-within-uk-children\" title=\"\">commissioned</a> by BookTrust found that only 2% of British children\u2019s book creators published in the UK were from a BAME background \u2013 helping to explain why only 1% of books surveyed in 2017 had a black or Asian lead character. Projects like Boyega\u2019s or Alexievich\u2019s are, obviously, good news for the writers or actors who reach an audience previously denied them. But their generosity stretches beyond that which they extend to their colleagues. By bringing us insight and joy that we would otherwise have missed, they may offer an even bigger gift to audiences.</p>",

It is that these countries have abandoned any measure to contain or restrain the virus,\u201d minister for national development, Lawrence Wong, said at a press briefing on Sunday. \u201cIf there\u2019s no attempt to contain, we estimate the number of cases in these countries to rise significantly in the coming days and weeks.\u201d</p> \n<p>An <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxKs8sYwHSLwhtQGP_oar1SJwfKtkXwCIJXAXKAsJfGYKF2w/viewform?vc=0&amp;c=0&amp;w=1\">open letter from a group including some of the UK\u2019s most senior doctors</a> asked the government to publish the modelling and any other evidence for the policies it is pursuing. \u201cOur country\u2019s public health response to Covid-19 is demonstrably different to most other countries\u2019 responses globally and in Europe \u2026 There is also no clear indication that the UK\u2019s response is being informed by experiences of other countries in containing the spread of Covid-19,\u201d it said, pointing out the risks to the NHS of a rapid and huge surge in cases of people needing hospital treatment.

Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, has suggested this might be a good outcome from many people becoming infected.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/herd-immunity-will-the-uks-coronavirus-strategy-work\">Herd immunity</a> is usually brought about by vaccination \u2013 not exposing people to the risks of a disease. \u201cThe ultimate aim of herd immunity is to stop disease spread and protect the most vulnerable in society. However, this strategy only works to reduce serious disease if, when building that immunity, vulnerable individuals are protected from becoming ill, for example through social distancing. If not, the consequences could be severe,\u201d says the letter from the British Society for Immunology.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/covidopenletter/home\">Behavioural scientists joined the concern</a>, saying they believed the government should immediately bring in social distancing measures and not delay for fear of the public getting \u201cbehavioural fatigue\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf \u2018behavioural fatigue\u2019 truly represents a key factor in the government\u2019s decision to delay high-visibility interventions, we urge the government to share an adequate evidence base in support of that decision. If one is lacking, we urge the government to reconsider these decisions,\u201d wrote Prof Ulrike Hahn from Birkbeck, University of London, and others.</p>",
  "<p>It seems that our government has decided that the spread of coronavirus in the population to levels creating herd immunity is inevitable, and indeed desirable (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/why-is-the-government-relying-on-nudge-theory-to-tackle-coronavirus\" title=\"\">Why rely on nudge theory to fight a virus?</a>, Journal, 14 March). However, on the basis of China, and indeed South Korea, where by stringent measures the spread of the virus was halted in its tracks at a relatively low level, massive population spread is not inevitable.</p> <p>We have not been told why such a policy by contrast is not appropriate for the UK. Given the pitifully low level of intensive care unit facilities and trained ICU staff here, it would seem even more critical for our country that the spread of the virus is not merely managed as an epidemiological case study, but stopped before the NHS is completely overwhelmed, as it will be at the levels of infection calmly being predicted by the government and its advisers.</p> <p>The approach looks dangerously like callous complacency rather than urgent emergency intervention. If carnage unfolds, we will look to the experience of other countries, and if we have a significantly higher death rate than others, our government will not be forgiven.<br><strong>Stephen Smith</strong><br><em>Glasgow</em></p> <p>\u2022 The UK government\u2019s strategy to minimise the impact of Covid-19 \u201cis to allow the virus to pass through the entire population so that we acquire herd immunity\u201d. Implicit in this is the acceptance of large numbers of deaths of vulnerable people, hence Boris Johnson saying that many families will lose loved ones. This sounds dangerously like what Malthus described in 1798 as \u201cpositive checks\u201d, which lead to premature death from disease, starvation and war, resulting in what is called a Malthusian catastrophe. In contrast, nearly every other government in Europe is pursuing a different strategy \u2013 one of containment. For once, the phrase \u201cbeing ahead of the curve\u201d, has deep meaning.<br><strong>Tom Conroy</strong><br><em>Dublin, Ireland</em></p> <p>\u2022 It has long been obvious that Boris Johnson exists in a moral vacuum, but to propose a public policy that tacitly accepts the potential death of thousands of people is beyond shameful and, equally so, to try to minimise its impact as the loss of loved ones before their time. Not only should we question the scientific validity of herd immunity, which the World Health Organization rejects, but also its morality. No wonder the rest of the world is looking with incredulity at the UK government\u2019s response to Covid-19.<br><strong>Alan Walker</strong><br><em>Professor of social policy, University of Sheffield</em></p> <p>\u2022 There is a reason why doctors take the Hippocratic oath. Now when key decisions on coronavirus are made by politicians, perhaps they should take it too. If herd immunity works, it will be at the cost of avoidable deaths \u2013 of patients, health workers and doctors. If it doesn\u2019t work, we will have a social experiment that failed, at the cost of many human lives. Boris Johnson said that \u201cmany more families are going to lose loved ones before their time\u201d. He should have finished his sentence with \u201cand many of those deaths are avoidable\u201d.</p> <p>Other countries aren\u2019t doing this, for good reason. If one of my friends or family die under this policy, I will seriously look at crowdfunding a judicial review. I think we should do everything possible to change this heartless and arrogant approach.<br><strong>Amanda Edwards</strong><br><em>Velindre, Llandysul</em></p> <p>\u2022 Tony Yates quotes Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, as explaining part of the reason for not embracing bans (on gatherings) is to encourage \u201cherd immunity\u201d. Surely this is a misinterpretation of what herd immunity is? Before the polio vaccine was developed people got polio. They didn\u2019t get herd immunity. Herd immunity is predicated on vaccination and it is the vaccinated who constitute the herd, not those with the disease. No vaccine just means more disease, not more immunity. This seems like a dangerous misunderstanding for one in such a pivotal role to make.<br><strong>Dr Andrew Platman</strong><br><em>GP retired, Beckenham, Kent</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your correspondents (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/this-government-must-show-us-the-evidence-behind-its-covid-19-policies\" title=\"\">Show us the evidence behind Covid-19 policies</a>, Journal, 14 March) are justified in their scepticism of the government\u2019s response to Covid-19; Boris Johnson and his colleagues haven\u2019t always been transparent on other matters. However, I do trust the chief medical officer (CMO) and chief scientific adviser (CSA) \u2013 expert clinician-scientists \u2013 and they appear to be leading decision-making at the moment.</p> <p>The CMO and CSA are wrestling with complex, contradictory, partial and rapidly-changing data, and formulating recommendations as best they can. Of course, there\u2019s a debate to be had as to why experts in other countries are initiating more severe restrictions, and more transparency on the modelling information being used would be welcome. More proscriptive actions come with significant risks of their own.

  "<p>Israeli political parties have backed the opposition leader, Benny Gantz, to form a government, in a shocking blow to Benjamin Netanyahu after he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/israel-election-benjamin-netanyahu-claims-early-victory-but-remains-short-of-majority\">appeared to come out ahead</a> in an election held earlier this month.</p> <p>The dramatic news came as a Jerusalem court postponed the prime minister\u2019s corruption trial due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Leaders of the main parties met Israel\u2019s president, Reuven Rivlin, on Sunday, giving Gantz the slimmest advantage of 61 recommendations from of a total of 120 lawmakers.</p> <p>The endorsement does not end Netanyahu\u2019s chances or guarantee Gantz will lead Israel\u2019s next administration. Before that can happen, he has up to six weeks of negotiations to forge a majority coalition in Israel\u2019s parliament, the Knesset.</p> <p>The success of that scenario remains far from certain. While Gantz will be officially picked by the president as prime minister-designate on Monday, some of the politicians who backed him on Sunday may not also agree to join his government.</p> <p>Fifteen of the recommendations came from an alliance of Arab parties, who may have only supported Gantz to damage their political nemesis, Netanyahu. It remained unclear if the Joint List group, a merger of politicians predominantly representing Palestinian citizens of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel\">Israel</a>, would join an administration led by Gantz, a former army chief with whom they have deep ideological differences.</p> <p>Gantz also won support from former defence minister Avigdor Lieberman, who heads the far-right, ultra-nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu party. Lieberman has repeatedly stated he would never join a government with Arab legislators, complicating Gantz\u2019s path to power.</p> <p>The dramatic news came at the end of a day in which Netanyahu\u2019s prospects appeared to be improving. A Jerusalem court announced that the long-awaited first hearing for the prime minister\u2019s corruption trial, scheduled for Tuesday, would be postponed until 24 May due to fears of the spread of the coronavirus in courthouses.</p> <p>About 210 people have been infected in Israel, with no deaths. Battling the outbreak, Israel has already imposed a series of stringent restrictions nationwide during the past few days, including barring gatherings of more than 10 people and shutting down schools, hotels, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and malls.</p> <p>The upcoming trial \u2013 in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/21/israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-indicted-for-bribery-and\">Netanyahu faces damning charges</a> of bribery, fraud and breach of trust \u2013 had been hanging over the 70-year-old leader and was set to start right as political negotiations were to begin.</p> <p>For a year, Israel has been in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/israel-limbo-third-election-twelve-months-netanyahu-gantz\">state of political paralysis</a> following three inconclusive elections, the latest of which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/israel-election-benjamin-netanyahu-claims-early-victory-but-remains-short-of-majority\">was held on 2 March</a>. In that time, both Netanyahu and Gantz have been picked to form governments and failed. Throughout the crisis, Netanyahu has remained interim prime minister.</p> <p>With neither Netanyahu or Gantz commanding a majority of support, the president has urged them to agree on a power-sharing unity deal. He summoned them for an emergency meeting on Sunday night in the hopes of breaking the deadlock.</p> <p>\u201cWe must establish a government as soon as possible that will lead our people at this complex time,\u201d Rivlin said.</p> <p>After months of acrimonious election campaigning, it is unclear if politicians will be able to break the stalemate.</p> <p>In a clear attempt to block his rival, Gantz has pushed for legislation to bar anyone indicted for a crime from heading an administration.</p> <p>Meanwhile, temporarily freed from his legal woes, Netanyahu has urged Gantz and other politicians to fall in line, arguing that the coronavirus outbreak meant the formation of an \u201cemergency government \u2026 led by me\u201d was all the more vital.</p> <p>Under Israel\u2019s current caretaker administration, the government is restricted in its ability to tackle any major crisis. For example, it cannot pass a budget.</p> <p>Netanyahu said his proposed emergency government could last six months, or that he and Gantz could agree to a four-year unity administration. In that case, Netanyahu would remain prime minister for the next two years.</p> <p>\u201cThe state of Israel needs it. The people of Israel expect it,\u201d Netanyahu said.</p> <p>Gantz accused the prime minister of manipulation during a public health scare. \u201cWhen you get serious, we can talk,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Separately, in an opaque move that raised immediate privacy issues, Netanyahu announced on Saturday night that he intended to use technology developed for counter-terrorism to track people with the coronavirus digitally.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6eabacd19541741268ef781476223c7dd998b4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6eabacd19541741268ef781476223c7dd998b4a/85_76_3162_1897/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Netanyahu faces damning charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in his upcoming trial.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Netanyahu faces damning charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cUp until today I avoided using these measures in the civilian population but there is no choice,\u201d Netanyahu said in a televised news conference.</p> <p>The announcement, which needs further approval, prompted accusations of mass surveillance. </p> <p>Noa Landau, who works for the progressive local Haaretz newspaper, <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/elections/.premium-coronavirus-crisis-cannot-chip-away-at-israeli-democracy-1.8675891\">wrote</a> an article on Sunday against what she called the \u201cpoliticisation of the health crisis\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIsrael is already on the edge when it comes to violations of individual rights.

  "<p>The Crown Prosecution Service conducted a secret internal review that exposed its failings in rape cases \u2013 but failed to share it with inspectors who were conducting an official inquiry for a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-sets-out-key-measures-to-tackle-violence-against-women-and-girls\">major government investigation into rape</a>, the Guardian can reveal.</p> <p>The CPS inspectorate and the government told the Guardian they were unaware of the existence of the report until January 2020.</p> <p>A Guardian investigation has obtained a copy of the unpublished report, which examined 200 unprosecuted rape cases. It found that in the majority of cases prosecutors were overreaching by making \u201cdisproportionate\u201d and \u201cunnecessary\u201d requests for additional information.</p> <p>However, the Guardian has learned that the CPS did not share its findings with Her Majesty\u2019s Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate (HMCPSI), which was undertaking a review of CPS cases as part of a government review into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/12/prosecutions-in-england-and-wales-at-lowest-level-in-a-decade\">falling rape prosecution rates</a>.</p> <p>The HMCPSI report was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/dec/17/fall-in-convictions-due-to-justice-system-at-breaking-point\">published in December 2019</a> and offered less stark conclusions than that found by the CPS\u2019s own secret report.</p> <p>In September last year, the director of public prosecutions, Max Hill, stated that there was a need for <a href=\"https://www.cps.gov.uk/cps/news/annual-violence-against-women-and-girls-report-published-0\">\u201ca frank and full conversation\u201d</a> about the fall in the number of referrals, charges, prosecutions and convictions of rape. The CPS also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/08/victims-demand-a-say-in-official-review-of-criminal-justice-failings\">stated</a> it was a \u201cpartner in this review, and will take part honestly and openly to scrutinise and further improve our work\u201d.</p> <p>However, the CPS has been accused of a lack of transparency after the existence of the internal report was revealed.</p> <p>Vera Baird, the victims\u2019 commissioner for England and Wales, said: \u201cThe CPS has promised to be open and frank with those carrying out the government\u2019s end-to-end rape review. So it is surprising that they did not disclose the very worrying results of this internal review at a time when the inspectorate was specifically examining the whole of the CPS role in rape cases.\u201d</p> <p>The internal CPS report found:</p> <ul> <li><p>Prosecutors made disproportionate requests in more than half (56%) of administratively finalised cases examined.</p></li> <li><p>Almost two-thirds (65%) of rape cases referred by police to the CPS for early investigative advice (EIA) had disproportionate requests for information.</p></li> <li><p>Police failed to complete all actions asked for by prosecutors in more than three-quarters of cases (78%).</p></li> <li><p>In all cases referred by the police for EIA, they were seeking a decision to drop \u201cexceptionally weak cases\u201d. This accounted for a third of all administratively finalised cases.</p></li> </ul> <p>The inspectorate\u2019s review found prosecutors made disproportionate requests in only 44% of administratively finalised cases. It also found that only 70% of action plans set by the CPS were not met with a proper response by police.</p> <p>Responding to questions from the Guardian, the CPS said it had made HMCPSI aware of its internal report in \u201cdiscussions\u201d before the start of its inspection, but had only shared it at the inspectorate\u2019s request in January. Asked if the HMCPSI was aware of the report when it was carrying out its inspection, the HMCPSI responded: \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>The internal CPS review, marked \u201cofficial-sensitive\u201d, found disproportionate requests included requests for \u201ca weather report from 1972\u201d, \u201cschool reports from the 70s and 80s\u201d and care home records where there \u201cwas no indication that these could have or would be relevant\u201d.</p> <p>The review examined 200 cases that had been \u201cadministratively finalised\u201d between October 2018 and March 2019. These are cases the CPS counts as \u201cclosed\u201d where police have not responded to requests for further evidence. However, the cases could be reopened at a later date were new evidence provided. The proportion of administratively finalised cases increased from 22% to 29% of all pre-charge decisions made by the CPS between 2017-18 and 2018-19.</p> <p>Other prosecutors had requested \u201call phone downloads\u201d and \u201cCCTV or 999 calls when it was clear there was no such evidence\u201d. The report said the cases showed \u201csome evidence that the exact nature of social media \u2026 was not understood by all prosecutors, for example the request for \u2018downloads of all Snapchat communication\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>In another case, a CPS prosecutor gave police an action plan with 30 actions \u201cnot specific to the case but a cut and paste set of generic actions\u201d. These requests had the effect of killing the case, as police did not, or were not able to, meet the demand for information.</p> <p>The report also reveals concerns about police actions. It found almost two-thirds of cases were of \u201cpoor quality\u201d, which \u201cindicates that the police are using the CPS as gatekeepers to quality control their files rather than undertaking proper supervision themselves\u201d. The report also found police were \u201cfailing to respond whatsoever\u201d to appropriate requests for more evidence in 75% of cases.</p> <p>The CPS said the report found no evidence that disproportionate requests contributed to delays. It added that when requests were disproportionate, often they were necessary but prosecutors had failed to set clear parameters. All specialist rape and sexual assault prosecutors had received training to address the issues raised in the internal report, said a spokesperson.</p> <p>Both the CPS and the HMCPSI said the reports had different aims, samples of cases and methodologies. The CPS said it \u201cwould not have been appropriate to share the report\u201d and that \u201croutine assurance work\u201d was not \u201croutinely circulated externally\u201d.</p> <p>In December, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/dec/17/fall-in-convictions-due-to-justice-system-at-breaking-point\">HMCPSI concluded it had found no evidence</a> the CPS was taking a more risk-averse approach \u2013 a claim not examined in the internal report \u2013 and charging easier cases to improve its prosecution rate. The CPS said the inspectorate report had provided an \u201cindependent affirmation of its charging decisions\u201d.

  "<p>My colleague David Turrell, who has died aged 70 following a long illness preceded by a stroke, was a tribunal judge. He adjudicated on disputes involving government administrative agencies, delivering justice to vulnerable people with skill and compassion.</p> <p>He began deciding welfare benefit appeals in 1984 as a member of social security tribunals and many thousands of appellants appreciated his incisive decisions. From 1993, he decided to specialise in that particular area of law, ceasing more lucrative work at the bar, and accepting appointment as a full-time legal chair of appeal tribunals.</p> <p>He was commended in 1996 for a unique collegiate approach to administration and personal development. In 1999 he became full-time district chair of appeal tribunals for east England, a position he held until his retirement.</p> <p>In 2008, as part of judicial reorganisation, tribunal legal chairs were at last recognised for the comprehensive work they performed and accordingly he was formally appointed a judge of the first-tier tribunal (social entitlement chamber). He had worked in most areas of the tribunal service, and his knowledge of social security law was recognised as \u201cencyclopedic\u201d.</p> <p>Born in Oxford, David was the son of John Turrell, an auto body assembler, and his wife, Mary (nee Jackson). He went to Oxford grammar school, continued his studies with the Workers\u2019 Educational Association and then signed up for a degree in social and political science at Emmanuel College, Cambridge.</p> <p>In 1971 he joined the Prison Service, serving for seven years and rising to be deputy governor of Bullwood Hall, a prison for women and young offenders in Essex. After a year\u2019s further study his degree was converted to a diploma in law and, after passing the bar examinations, he achieved his ambition, becoming a barrister of the Inner Temple in 1979.</p> <p>In 1978 he married Elizabeth Galvin, a doctor, who practised in Hockley, Essex, where the family settled. They had two children, Richard and Michael. David enjoyed his family, fellowship, rugby and travelling to the Greek islands. He was also a stalwart supporter of St Peter and St Paul\u2019s church in Hockley. </p> <p>He is survived by Elizabeth, Richard and Michael.</p>",
  "<p>People over 70 will soon be asked to stay at home for up to four months to protect themselves from the risk of contracting coronavirus, the UK health secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/matt-hancock\">Matt Hancock</a>, has said.</p> \n<p>Ministers are also not ruling out ordering the closure of all bars, restaurants and non-essential shops as the coronavirus pandemic escalates.</p> \n<p>Such drastic measures would go beyond what the government anticipated in <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-action-plan/coronavirus-action-plan-a-guide-to-what-you-can-expect-across-the-uk\">its coronavirus action plan</a>, but countries such as France have ordered closures on this scale and Hancock said the government would do whatever was necessary to protect life.</p> \n<p>Hancock confirmed the government will soon tell people over 70 that they will need to self-isolate at home for up to four months to protect themselves from the disease \u2013 but his terminology caused some confusion, leading Scottish officials to stress that elderly people would not be asked to avoid all contact with other people.</p> \n<p>In an interview on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, Hancock said asking the over-70s to stay self-isolated would be \u201ca very big ask\u201d, but that it was part of the government\u2019s action plan because it would be necessary to protect them. He said this would be announced in the coming weeks.</p> \n<p> Jason Leitch, the national clinical director for the Scottish government, which is working with the Westminster government on a UK-wide coronavirus strategy, subsequently said on Twitter there was no plan to ask the over-70s to \u201ccompletely socially isolate\u201d and that the proposal for older people would be to minimise social contact, not end it.</p> \n<p>In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasonleitch/status/1239158887540043777\">a tweet</a>, he said: \u201cWe are working on guidance for the over-70s to be asked to REDUCE social contact for their safety. So no bingo, no pubs \u2026 BUT family visits and neighbours etc.\u201d</p> \n<p>The term self-isolation has been used by health officials to refer to the very strict isolation routine supposed to be followed by people with coronavirus, but on Sunday morning Hancock seemed to be using it in the looser sense that has become commonplace \u2013 referring to staying at home and minimising social interaction.</p> \n<p>The health department said guidelines saying exactly what the new advice for the over-70s would mean in practice would be published in due course. </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>In the Marr interview, Hancock was asked if the government would follow countries such as France and Spain, where bars, restaurants and shops have been closed, apart from supermarkets and pharmacies.</p> \n<p>Hancock replied: \u201cWe have not ruled that out.

Operating theatres were suitable because they had oxygen supplies, he said.</p> \n<p>He also said he was looking at converting hotels, \u201cmany of which are currently empty\u201d, into temporary hospitals.</p> \n<p>And he said the government would be urging manufacturers to produce more ventilators. He said the NHS already had about 5,000 ventilators, which were needed for people who get severely ill through coronavirus, but he said the country needed \u201cmany times more than that\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said that, although they were complicated pieces of machinery, they were not so complex that it was impossible for advanced manufacturers to switch to producing them, and he said that in a conference call, scheduled for Monday, Boris Johnson would be urging manufacturing companies to do just this.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are saying: you produce a ventilator, then we will buy it.

She does a profound service to the complex life of this remarkable woman with her new biography, Truganini: Journey Through the Apocalypse. Pybus ventures beyond the tragic trope that has defined Truganini, the sadness surrounding her death and the horror of the exhumation and display of her remains by the Royal Society of Tasmania.</p> <p>This was part of Truganini\u2019s life and postmortem, of course. But Pybus brings so much more of Truganini\u2019s experience to the page. She gives us her story of survival and at times unimaginable physical endurance in what Pybus aptly describes as an apocalypse (<em>Ria Warrawah</em> \u2013 the intangible force of evil unleashed with European arrival \u2013 to Truganini\u2019s Nuenonne people) that descended upon the first Tasmanians post-invasion.</p> <p>Their world was upended. Under the governor George Arthur martial law was declared as the colony tried to rid itself \u2013 through war, ongoing massacres and poisonings, and later the absurdly ineffective \u201cblack line\u201d \u2013 of Tasmania\u2019s First Peoples.</p> <p>Pybus presents Truganini\u2019s life as one of resilience and of adaptation to precarious pathways through dispossession. It shows her negotiating the sexual demands of the violent sealers and others, and of the traditions she managed to cling to \u2013 including marriage to Wooredy \u2013 despite the constant infringements of colonialism\u2019s avaricious commodification of land, resources and Indigenous bodies.</p> <p>The figure \u2013 and the rich archive \u2013 of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/14/the-national-picture-overwhelming-reminder-of-wilful-gaps-in-australias-history\">George Augustus Robinson</a>, a self-styled missionary who took it upon himself to \u201cconciliate\u201d with the Indigenes of Tasmania (and to remove them from their land and herd them into one isolated place) partly informs Pybus\u2019s Truganini. But where other scholars and writers have mined the Robinson archive for all it says about this perplexing and morally ambiguous man himself, Pybus has drawn from his invaluable, decades\u2019-long observation of Truganini.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4157059f8003cf085da3ed72a55774766c5c65f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4157059f8003cf085da3ed72a55774766c5c65f9/0_0_1795_2776/647.jpg\" alt=\"The cover of Truganini by Cassandra Pybus\" width=\"647\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Truganini emerges as wholly, spiritually and physically in sync with her natural world, having rejected Christianity despite the efforts of Robinson and others to inculcate her and the others.</p> <p>We learn of the fabulous swimmer who relished diving for crayfish (there\u2019s an encounter with a shark!).

Once in the canopy, she would grab at the possum to knock it to the ground.\u201d</p> <p>While this communion with nature should be no surprise, Pybus\u2019s portrayal of that relationship is laced with moving poignancy, her prose about the bounty and wonder of country and Truganini\u2019s connection to it as lush and beautiful as the land itself.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2019/oct/03/captain-cooks-legacy-is-complex-but-whether-white-australia-likes-it-or-not-he-is-emblematic-of-violence-and-oppression\">Captain Cook's legacy is complex, but whether white Australia likes it or not he is emblematic of violence and oppression | Paul Daley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is a reason for this.

  "<p>Egypt is likely grappling with a higher rate of coronavirus infections than official figures, according to research by Canadian disease specialists and increasing infection among tourists who departed in recent weeks.</p> \n<p>At least 97 foreign nationals who visited Egypt since mid-February showed symptoms or tested positive for Covid-19 on return home, according to public health data and news reports. Most spent time on Nile cruises believed to be the source of the outbreak in the southern city of Luxor, a tourism hotspot.</p> \n<p>Egyptian officials say that an additional 126 foreign nationals and Egyptians have tested positive for the coronavirus since mid-February. This includes a 60-year-old woman declared dead on Thursday in the Nile Delta city of Mansoura, 465 miles from Luxor.</p> \n<p>Her death, the first of an Egyptian citizen during the current epidemic, came a week after officials removed 45 passengers from the Asara cruise ship later quarantined in Luxor. Some 82 passengers left quarantine on board the ship and travelled home just days later, after officials from Egypt\u2019s ministry of health flew to Luxor to screen 558 more people \u2013 all tested negative.

But it has also sought to control the narrative, even as nearby countries banned entry from Egypt.</p> \n<p>Doctors and pharmacists who spoke with the Guardian doubted that Egypt\u2019s public healthcare system is prepared for the impact of Covid-19.

Their performances became increasingly extreme, featuring body-cutting and involving P-Orridge and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/mar/14/cosey-fanni-tutti-throbbing-gristle-coum-art-sex-music-hull-2017\" title=\"\">Cosey Fanni Tutti</a> (AKA Christine Carol Newby) having sex onstage. In her autobiography Art Sex Music (2017), Fanni Tutti made allegations that P-Orridge had been a violent and manipulative partner, which were denied by P-Orridge.</p> <p>Throbbing Gristle was founded on 3 September 1975 (on the 36th anniversary of Britain declaring war on Germany), comprising Tutti and P-Orridge alongside Chris Carter and Peter Christopherson, and for a time continued alongside COUM.</p> <p>COUM\u2019s show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/18/genesis-p-orridge-ica-exhibition-1976\" title=\"\">Prostitution</a>, staged at the ICA in London in 1976, provoked uproar with its pornographic images, sculptures fashioned from used tampons and transvestite security guards, prompting the Scottish Conservative MP <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaries-sir-nicholas-fairbairn-1573984.html\" title=\"\">Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</a> to describe P-Orridge and Tutti as \u201cwreckers of civilisation\u201d.</p> <p>P-Orridge was born Neil Megson in Longsight, Manchester, the child of Muriel and Ronald Megson. Ronald was a travelling salesman, jazz drummer and former actor who had survived Dunkirk with the British Army in 1940. The family moved to Essex, then later to Cheshire, where Neil attended Gatley primary school and won a scholarship to Stockport grammar school. In 1964 Neil was sent to the private Solihull school.</p> <p>There tastes for literature and the avant-garde were developed and Neil became fascinated with the writings of the magician and occultist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/15/unseen-aleister-crowley-writings-short-story-the-drug\" title=\"\">Aleister Crowley</a>. (In 1981 Neil would form Thee Temple Ov Psychick Youth, an association of occultists.) In 1965 Neil founded his first band, Worm, with some school friends. They recorded an album, Early Worm (1968), but only one vinyl copy of it was produced.</p> <p>In 1968, Neil went to Hull University to study social administration and philosophy, but dropped out the following year and moved to London joining the Transmedia Explorations commune in Islington. By the end of 1969 Neil was back in Hull, where COUM Transmissions was developed with John Shapeero.</p> <p>The later phases of P-Orridge\u2019s life were in some ways the most startling. P-Orridge moved to the US in the 1990s, following allegations (that subsequently proved false) in a Channel 4 Dispatches documentary that s/he had been involved in satanic ritual abuse.</p> <p>In 1993 P-Orridge met Jacqueline Breyer, who was working at a New York S&amp;M dungeon. She adopted the name <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/lady-jaye-breyer-p-orridge-397604.html\" title=\"\">Lady Jaye Breyer P-Orridge</a>, and they moved in together in Queens, New York. They married in California in 1995, the year that P-Orridge was badly injured while escaping a fire at the Los Angeles home of the record producer Rick Rubin. He was awarded $1.5m compensation in 1998.</p> <p>The couple set about using plastic surgery to become mirror images of one another, beginning with matching breast implants on Valentine\u2019s Day 2003, and continuing with work on eyes and nose, liposuction and hormone therapy. They dressed in identical outfits, and P-Orridge coined the term \u201cpandrogyny\u201d to express the idea that they fused into a third person, Breyer P-Orridge, who only existed when they were together. P-Orridge subsequently preferred the self-descriptor \u201cwe\u201d, though did not object to being called \u201cs/he\u201d.</p> <p>This pandrogyny project was cut short when Breyer died of acute heart arrhythmia in 2007, an especially painful loss at a time when P-Orridge was beginning to receive highbrow acclaim. The Invisible-Exports gallery in New York staged a retrospective of their collages, <a href=\"http://invisible-exports.com/exhibitions/30-years-of-being-cut-up/\" title=\"\">30 Years of Being Cut Up</a>, and in 2009 <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/genesis-p-orridge-16646\" title=\"\">Tate</a> Britain purchased their archive.</p> <p>Marie Losier\u2019s documentary film The Ballad of Genesis and Lady Jaye was released in 2011, and in 2016 the Rubin Museum of Art in New York hosted <a href=\"http://rubinmuseum.org/events/exhibitions/genesis-breyer-p-orridge\" title=\"\">Try to Altar Everything</a>, an exhibition of P-Orridge\u2019s paintings, sculptures and installations. In 2018 s/he published Brion Gysin: His Name Was Master, a collection of interviews and essays.</p> <p>In 2003 P-Orridge had unveiled PTV3, a new band drawing on the legacy of Psychic TV. They released four albums and several EPs between 2007 and 2016. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/10/genesis-p-orridge-throbbing-gristle\" title=\"\">2018</a> they performed at Heaven in London. </p> <p>P-Orridge is survived by two daughters, Genesse and Caresse, from a first marriage, to Paula Brooking, which ended in divorce.</p> <p>\u2022 Genesis P-Orridge (Neil Andrew Megson), musician, writer and performance artist, born 22 February 1950; died 14 March 2020</p>",
  "<p>The majority of whole property short-term lets advertised in Edinburgh may be unlawful, according to early results from a new data tool that suggests that almost all are operating without planning consent.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/20/revealed-the-areas-in-the-uk-with-one-airbnb-for-every-four-homes\">Exclusive analysis for the Guardian</a> published last month revealed that Airbnb has become so prevalent across Britain that some parts of the country have one listing for every four properties, with the highest incidence in Edinburgh old town, bolstering concerns that short-term lets are depriving communities of much-needed homes.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.homesfirst.scot/\">online tracking tool</a> to chart the scale of short-term lets available across Scotland was launched by the Scottish Green MSP Andy Wightman in January, and allows people to report properties in their local area that are operating as commercial lets.</p> <p>In early figures seen by the Guardian, of the 359 commercial short-term lets recorded so far, only one has planning consent according to information publicly available from Edinburgh city council. The council\u2019s position is that commercial short-term letting is a material change of use requiring planning permission. If these results were replicated across Scotland, that would suggest 99.7% of short-term lets in Scotland could be unlawful.</p> <p>Wightman, whose campaigning work on short-term lets was prompted by stories of individual distress and disrupted communities from his Edinburgh constituents, notes that there are 480 listings for Edinburgh on the website of public agency VisitScotland.</p> <p>The Lothian region MSP, who has led on the issue, said: \u201cThis early picture from my Homes First site reveals the depressing truth of how out of control this sector is. All but one of the properties identified so far have no planning consent to be a short-term let. Any property that should have planning consent but does not is unlawful.</p> <p>\u201cWhile proposed new licensing powers are welcome, they will not be of much use if owners are so willing to flout planning laws. The Scottish government\u2019s commitment to regulation is further undermined by the fact that Visit Scotland, which has a strategic partnership with Airbnb, is actively promoting holiday accommodation that is unlawful despite encouraging visitors to book only licensed and regulated accommodation. Scottish ministers should ask their own tourism agency to stop advertising unlawful businesses.\u201d</p> <p>In January, as a direct response to concerns raised by local residents of popular tourist destinations, the Scottish government announced councils would be given new powers to introduce licensing schemes for short-term lets from 2021.</p> <p>Neil Gardiner, planning convener for Edinburgh city council, said: \u201cWe\u2019ll always use the existing powers we have through planning enforcement to investigate cases reported to us as we are very clear that we want properties unlawfully taken out of housing supply to be returned to being people\u2019s homes.</p> <p>\u201cThis is very resource-intensive though and we\u2019re continuing to proactively work with the Scottish government to introduce a licensing regime which will give us far greater control over the sector in the future. Our consultation on <a href=\"https://consultationhub.edinburgh.gov.uk/sfc/choicesforcityplan2030/\">\u2018Choices for City Plan 2030\u2019</a> is also currently under way. It is asking people, along with many other questions, if Edinburgh should be a short-term let control zone implemented through new planning policies.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In August 2009, an exhibition titled Innovative Women opened in Johannesburg, aiming to showcase the work of the city\u2019s young black female artists. The launch was attended by Lulu Xingwana, minister for arts and culture at the time, who had been invited to officially open the show. But instead of giving a speech, Xingwana stormed out of the gallery after seeing images by the photographer <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/zanele-muholi\" title=\"\">Zanele Muholi </a>that depicted naked women in close embrace. Muholi\u2019s work, said the minister, was immoral, offensive and ran contrary to \u201csocial cohesion and nation-building\u201d. South Africa has one of the most progressive constitutions in the world, with discrimination on the basis of sexuality barred by law. Yet censorious attitudes such as Xingwana\u2019s towards homosexuality are widespread. Almost three-quarters of the population believe same-sex sexual activity is morally wrong, according to a 2016 survey. Similarly intolerant views are commonplace across Africa. Homosexuality is outlawed in <a href=\"https://ilga.org/maps-sexual-orientation-laws\" title=\"\">32 </a><a href=\"https://ilga.org/maps-sexual-orientation-laws\" title=\"\">of the continent\u2019s 54 nations</a>. It is punishable by life imprisonment in Uganda, Tanzania and Sierra Leone. In Sudan, southern Somalia, Somaliland, Mauritania and northern Nigeria, the penalty is death. Against that backdrop the work of a photographer such as Muholi takes on a dual role, both representing individual artistic expression and operating as a form of political activism; a means to positively assert LGBTQ+ identity in straitened circumstances.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"505dbf02d389be263da8ffa8e2d626e067e706e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/505dbf02d389be263da8ffa8e2d626e067e706e8/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ama and Shana at lunch by Eric Gyamfi, 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Ama and Shana at lunch by Eric Gyamfi, 2016<br></strong>Gay relationships are illegal in Ghana, where photographer Gyamfi was born, but the tender, intimate images in the series Just Like Us, where Gyamfi documents life in the country\u2019s queer communities, do not dwell on the sexuality of his subjects but emphasise their ordinariness.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Gyamfi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p><strong>Ama and Shana at lunch by Eric Gyamfi, 2016<br></strong>Gay relationships are illegal in Ghana, where photographer Gyamfi was born, but the tender, intimate images in the series Just Like Us, where Gyamfi documents life in the country\u2019s queer communities, do not dwell on the sexuality of his subjects but emphasise their ordinariness.</p></li> </ul> <p>As well as serving to resist oppression, Muholi\u2019s imagery raises a larger question: how do you depict the reality of your life when your very existence is subject to denial or attack? The Ghanaian photographer Eric Gyamfi spent a year documenting queer individuals and communities in his series <a href=\"https://www.movingwalls.org/moving-walls/24/just-like-us.html\" title=\"\">Just Like Us</a>. Same-sex sexual activity is illegal in Ghana, but you wouldn\u2019t know it from his pictures. Shot in gorgeously textured black and white, the photographs are an intimate evocation of everyday life, titled with studied plainness: Ama and Shana at lunch; Kwasi at Kokrobite beach; Atsu during dance; Kwasi in bed. When queerness is regarded as the opposite of normality, the answer, suggests Gyamfi, is to insist on the very ordinariness of the people being documented and in so doing declare them as individually complex as everyone else. \u201cPeople are queer but people are also other things,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople who do not understand queerness have a singular notion of what queer people are supposed to be or supposed to look like. So what I came in to do was to show people that queer people are people first and that they cut across all categories of humanness. There is no singular way of showing who a queer person is, I feel. They can be anything or anybody.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4000a1df61dbe37c6d1eb04e7fd90c434e6a069\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4000a1df61dbe37c6d1eb04e7fd90c434e6a069/0_0_2000_2909/688.jpg\" alt=\"Afrikan Boy Sittin\u2019 by Hassan Hajjaj, 2013\" width=\"688\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Afrikan Boy Sittin\u2019 by Hassan Hajjaj, 2013 <br></strong> With its explosion of colours and distinctive handmade frame, this image typifies the powerful and assertive nature of the Morocco-born photographer\u2019s work.

Notwithstanding the prevalence of anti-LGBTQ+ laws across the continent, his photographs illustrate the fact that queer lives do not exist outside the Ghanaian mainstream, but are an everyday aspect of society. This is also evident in the work of<a href=\"https://www.bjp-online.com/2018/10/sabelo-mlangeni/\" title=\"\"> Sabelo Mlangeni</a>. Narratives of queer community formation are mostly set in an urban context, where the anonymity and bustle of city life allows individuals to establish an identity and lifestyle on their own terms, unencumbered by ties of tradition or family. Mlangeni\u2019s photographs tell a different tale. His Country Girls series focuses on gay men in remote, rural South African towns that are traditionally hostile to people who identify as LGBTQ+.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4cdf935348fb12599528c373bbfd900f6e2e88ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cdf935348fb12599528c373bbfd900f6e2e88ab/0_0_3468_2425/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vintage by Sabelo Mlangeni, 2009\" width=\"1000\" height=\"699\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Vintage by Sabelo Mlangeni, 2009<br></strong>The South African photographer, who works mainly in black and white, documents queer life in the townships of Mpumalanga province in his Country Girls series.

The scholar Graeme Reid notes that in such settings, \u201cgay people are regarded ambiguously\u201d. Although perceived by some as \u201cun-African\u201d, they still maintain a place in rural society as the stylish, cosmopolitan outliers, \u201cbringing the very latest fashion styles to the countryside. To be fashionable may be frivolous, modern and, by implication, untraditional, but gay people also embody a set of aspirations, a desire for the new.\u201d Reid continues: \u201cModernity is at once threatening and desirable, and to the extent that gay people occupy this symbolic space, they are both celebrated and despised.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f127f0a8daf4d006d858a562c49d4e1e965a992\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f127f0a8daf4d006d858a562c49d4e1e965a992/0_0_1695_2362/718.jpg\" alt=\"Bhekezakhe, Parktown by Zanele Muholi, 2016\" width=\"718\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Bhekezakhe, Parktown by Zanele Muholi, 2016 <br></strong>The self-portrait is part of a project entitled Somnyama Ngonyama (Hail, the Dark Lioness), in which the South African artist uses direct, psychologically charged images to confront the politics of race and representation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zanele Muholi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p><strong>Bhekezakhe, Parktown by Zanele Muholi, 2016 <br></strong>The self-portrait is part of a project entitled Somnyama Ngonyama (Hail, the Dark Lioness), in which the South African artist uses direct, psychologically charged images to confront the politics of race and representation.</p></li> </ul> <p>Other photographers of African origin woring today look outside specific issues of sexuality and explore cultural identity more broadly. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/sep/25/morocco-a-go-go-the-eye-popping-visions-of-hassan-hajjaj-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Hassan Hajjaj\u2019s photographs</a>, which are shot in the streets and squares of Marrakech, show men and women desporting before the camera like fashion models, gleefully surmounting western cliches of Arab and north African comportment and identity.

  "<p>Your house is on fire, and the people whom you have trusted with your care are not trying to put it out. Even though they knew it was coming, and could see what happened to the neighbours as they were overwhelmed with terrifying speed, the UK government has inexplicably chosen to encourage the flames, in the misguided notion that somehow they will be able to control them.</p> \n<p>When I first heard about this, I could not believe it.

We can only hope the gamble pays off | Devi Sridhar</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Let me take the arguments on their merits. The stated aim has been to achieve \u201cherd immunity\u201d in order to manage the outbreak and prevent a catastrophic \u201csecond wave\u201d next winter \u2013 even if Matt Hancock has tried to put that <a href=\"https://politicshome.com/news/uk/health-and-care/illnesstreatments/news/110595/matt-hancock-insists-herd-immunity-not-part\" title=\"\">particular genie back in the bottle this weekend</a>. A large proportion of the population is at lower risk of developing severe disease: roughly speaking anyone up to the age of 40. So the reasoning goes that even though in a perfect world we\u2019d not want anyone to take the risk of infection, generating immunity in younger people is a way of protecting the population as a whole.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"04fecb04-934a-4af1-baee-358948ad8ba5\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0hG3V9378fg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>We talk about vaccines generating herd immunity, so why is this different? Because this is not a vaccine. This is an actual pandemic that will make a very large number of people sick, and some of them will die. Even though the mortality rate is likely quite low, a small fraction of a very large number is still a large number. And the mortality rate will climb when the NHS is overwhelmed. This would be expected to happen, even if we make the generous assumption that the government were entirely successful in restricting the virus to the low-risk population, at the peak of the outbreak the numbers requiring critical care would be greater than the number of beds available. This is made worse by the fact that people who are badly ill tend to remain so for a long time, which increases the burden.</p> \n<p>And of course you can\u2019t restrict it to this age group. Think of all the people aged between 20 and 40 who work in healthcare, or old people\u2019s homes. You don\u2019t need many introductions into settings like these for what we might coyly call \u201csevere outcomes\u201d. In Washington State, nearly all the deaths reported so far have been associated with nursing homes. Is everyone in a high-risk group supposed to withdraw themselves from society for six months until they can emerge once the (so far entirely imaginary) second wave has been averted?</p> \n<p>About that second wave: let me be clear. Second waves are real things, and we have seen them in flu pandemics. This is not a flu pandemic. Flu rules do not apply. There might well be a second wave, I honestly don\u2019t know. But vulnerable people should not be exposed to a virus right now in the service of a hypothetical future.</p> \n<p>Keeping people safe means self-isolation if you develop symptoms, but the official advice here is also misleading. While it is of paramount importance that sick people stay at home to avoid infecting others, it is increasingly clear that transmission can occur before symptoms develop. We know this is true from modelling and observational studies. I have seen it happen myself. We do not know how often it occurs or how important it is in the epidemiology, but it definitely does happen.</p> \n<p>However, arguments about the case fatality rate, the transmission parameters and presymptomatic transmission all miss the point. This virus is capable of shutting down countries. You should not want to be the next after Wuhan, Iran, Italy or Spain. In those places, the healthcare systems have broken down. In Italy, the choices of whom to save and whom to allow to die are real. You should instead look to the example of South Korea, which, through a combination of intense surveillance and social distancing, appears to have gained some semblance of control over the virus. We can learn from South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, all of which have so far done a good job mitigating the worst outcomes despite having reported cases early in the pandemic, and in the case of South Korea, suffering a substantial outbreak.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/this-coronavirus-crisis-has-forced-the-retirement-of-pantomime-johnson\">This coronavirus crisis has forced the retirement of pantomime Johnson | Andrew Rawnsley</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The UK should not be trying to create herd immunity, that will take care of itself. Policy should be directed at slowing the outbreak to a (more) manageable rate. What this looks like is strong social distancing. Anyone who can work from home, should. People who do not yet work from home should be encouraged to do so. Employers should guarantee sick pay, including for contacts of known cases, and do everything they can to discourage the practice of \u201cpresenteeism\u201d. You should not shake hands. Not with anyone. You should wash your hands for 20 seconds several times a day and whenever you enter your home (or someone else\u2019s home). Call a halt to large gatherings. Educate people about masks and how they should be reserved for the medical professionals who need them. All this and more should have started weeks ago.</p> \n<p>Deciding whether to close schools is hard; they do so much more than just education. But this is a pandemic, and so you should expect they will be shut sooner or later. In Hong Kong, they have been shut for weeks. If you hear any talking head on TV explain that kids don\u2019t get sick, remember that doesn\u2019t mean kids cannot be infected and transmit. It\u2019s probably a good idea to hold off on visits to Nana and Grandpa.</p> \n<p>The most fundamental function of a government is to keep its people safe. It is from this that it derives its authority, the confidence of the people and its legitimacy. Nobody should be under the illusion that this is something that can be dodged through somehow manipulating a virus that we are only beginning to understand. This will not pass you by; this is not a tornado, it is a hurricane.</p> \n<p>Don\u2019t panic, but do prepare.

  "<p>Mae Martin is an addict. At the age of six, she was addicted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/bette-midler\" title=\"\">Bette Midler</a>. It was a curious, grand, important feeling and one she knew she must indulge alone, in her room after dinner. At 11, after she was invited up on stage to pretend to be a ventriloquist\u2019s dummy, and there felt the full force of an audience\u2019s laughter, Martin became addicted to standup comedy, leaving school three years later to perform full-time. She would walk onstage at 14 with a cigarette to complicated silences, and spend her evenings with adults, and their alcohol, and their cocaine. At 16 she was addicted to drugs and her parents kicked her out. Now 32, having been through rehab and moved from Toronto to London, she has used her 10,000-plus hours of standup to carve out a unique place in British comedy where she talks about all of these things; a place that is warm and clean and wise, and very funny.</p> <p>Shrugging off her jacket on a winterish afternoon last month, Martin was cautious but charming. White-haired, wide-eyed, she appeared freshly hatched. She\u2019d just come from having a new suit fitted \u2013 the answer, hopefully, to her long-standing anxieties over how to dress in order to feel like herself. Except, the tailor kept referencing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/ellen-degeneres\" title=\"\">Ellen DeGeneres</a> when she had been quite clear that he was to cut the suit with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/leonardodicaprio\" title=\"\">Leonardo DiCaprio</a> in mind, and only Leonardo DiCaprio. I could clearly picture the conversation: her polite insistence that he accept who she told him she was, rather than impose his own ideas.</p> <p>This will not be her first suit. As a child, she wore a three-piece suit and bow tie, and it was in this divine little outfit that her parents first took her to see the standup shows that would change her life. \u201cWatching comedy for the first time I felt absolutely on fire. I just couldn\u2019t believe there was this environment where people were being applauded for the weirdest things about themselves,\u201d she says, opening her eyes even wider. \u201cEspecially feeling like an outsider at school, and then finding this community where I could own those things and be applauded for them. People who would laugh with me instead of at me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74cc5b557e21ca2a8c9363816eeca538a433b390\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74cc5b557e21ca2a8c9363816eeca538a433b390/171_269_5589_3571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mae Martin at the Edinburgh International Festival Fringe, 2017\" width=\"1000\" height=\"639\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mae Martin at the Laughing Horse at City Cafe Free Festival at the Edinburgh International Festival Fringe, 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRZ9-xDZ14w\" title=\"\">video on YouTube</a> of her performing at 16, in character as a competitor in a public-speaking competition about \u201cwomen in media\u201d. The audience seems equal parts dazzled and confused by the combination of lonely desperation and <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> obsession she presents, in cropped hair and pinafore dress. These days audiences are less confused; instead of leading with her awkwardness, she explores it, performs it and invites us to laugh at it with her. Her most recent standup tours were Us, in 2015, about sex and gender identity, and Dope, in 2017, about addiction \u2013 both were turned into BBC radio shows.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a slow process of getting closer and closer to my actual personality on stage. And now there\u2019s very little separation. I definitely find the more open and vulnerable I am, the more people enjoy it,\u201d she grins in understatement.</p> <p>\u201cThe first time I saw Mae\u2019s work,\u201d the actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ellenpage\" title=\"\">Ellen Page</a> says via email, \u201cI not only laughed so hard, I was struck by her honesty, vulnerability, intelligence and ability to tell personal stories that render them relatable to us all. I am inspired by Mae,\u201d she adds, \u201cand lucky to call her a friend.\u201d</p> <p>Today audiences treat Martin with a similarly delicate awe. Usually. \u201cWell, I got heckled the other night. I was talking about gender identity and this woman shouted, \u2018No one cares!\u2019 It was so harsh, but I couldn\u2019t stop laughing. Partly because I was in control and partly because, well, I replied something like, \u2018The problem is that people actually care too much!\u2019 There\u2019s so much hysteria around gender, hysteria that comes from a place of misinformation and fear.\u201d She shrugs. Chuckles. Once, a therapist warned her that if she completed therapy, she\u2019d probably stop being funny. \u201cI was, like, \u2018I disagree.\u2019 I knew my job was not mutually exclusive to happiness. I think she was romanticising that tortured-artist thing, which I don\u2019t buy into any more. Really. If you\u2019re unhappy, you can\u2019t make anything.\u201d</p> <p>Dope, her show on addiction, took longer to brew. \u201cYeah, I needed enough distance from that time in my life to\u2026 retrospect. I approached it pretty academically and did tonnes of research and tried to make sense of it. And then I started telling my stories on stage and hoping the punchlines emerged.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a11c20b9312c900501ddd44beac89ff167ad7b2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a11c20b9312c900501ddd44beac89ff167ad7b2c/175_360_4258_2340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mae Martin, Charlotte Ritchie, Adrian Lukis and Lisa Kudrow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Feel Good comedy: (from left) Mae Martin, Charlotte Ritchie, Adrian Lukis and Lisa Kudrow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What did she learn? \u201cI guess the big realisation was that addiction isn\u2019t really about substances. The definition that I use is from [writer and physician] Dr Gabor Mat\u00e9, which is: addiction is something that you crave, find relief from and can\u2019t give up, despite knowing the negative consequences.\u201d Imagine, she asks her audiences, that they\u2019ve just realised they\u2019ve left their phone in the bar \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t burst into tears, but the nagging anxiety, the need to touch it again, would mean they wouldn\u2019t laugh for the rest of the show. \u201cRight? His is such a broad definition and resonates with so many people, whether it\u2019s our phones or food or sex or relationships. Things that we know are bad for us, but that soothe us when we\u2019re finding the present moment difficult. Hearing that was kind of a breakthrough for me.\u201d</p> <p>Why? \u201cBecause I think I was patting myself on the back for getting off drugs and not realising, actually, that addictive behaviour was still permeating my life in a lot of ways. So that\u2019s what the TV series is about.\u201d</p> <p>The TV series, yes. We are here to discuss <em>Feel Good</em>, a new Channel 4 comedy, co-written by and starring Martin as a comedian called Mae, navigating the sensitive dynamics of her NA group, a relationship with a straight girl (played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/mar/29/charlotte-ritchie-funniest-things\" title=\"\">Charlotte Ritchie</a>), and a strained bond with her mother, performed magnificently by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/lisa-kudrow\" title=\"\">Lisa Kudrow</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My sexuality is not a huge part of who I am. It\u2019s not even a particularly interesting part</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe character Mae is where I was about 10 years ago. So it\u2019s a pretty tenuous grip on sobriety, just fresh out of the depths of addiction and super manic. I have a pretty good hold on my life now \u2013 I\u2019m pretty stable. But I definitely feel like, in a way\u2026 I miss her.\u201d The old Mae is seen on screen as a panicked romantic who lies awake at night with her hands hovering in fists above her chest. \u201cShe\u2019s a mess, with all her agony and ecstasy, but I do miss the optimism and naivety. I don\u2019t miss the lows, but losing those sometimes means you don\u2019t get the highs.\u201d</p> <p>Five years ago Martin transferred her addictive obsession on to this script, this series, and she digs her hands into her knees at the thought that soon it will be out, in the world, with all the judgment and mainstream fame that might mean. She wants to be clear: it is comedy, not therapy. \u201cNo this is not purely some cathartic therapeutic exercise for me. Me and Joe [Hampson, her co-writer] really just wanted to write a good comedy that had a lot of heart. It\u2019s a work of fiction. But it\u2019s got an emotional truth, because it\u2019s based on experiences I\u2019ve had. I\u2019ve dated lots of girls who\u2019ve never been with a girl before, for instance, which makes for quite a romantic and painful dynamic.\u201d</p> <p>And for all the pain of bleeding her own life into six half-hours, the surprise agony actually came from acting for the first time. \u201cI sort of thought acting was just about arranging your face into emotions. I didn\u2019t realise it was about actually allowing yourself to feel the feelings, then letting your face follow. That was a big learning curve.\u201d</p> <p>Actually allowing herself to feel the feelings has been a lesson in more ways than one. Since discussing her childhood and addictions on stage, Martin\u2019s life has expanded, along with her career. \u201cIt\u2019s enriching and cathartic to share things that your gut tells you are not all right to say. To say things that you\u2019re embarrassed or ashamed of, and then have everybody go: \u2018Me too.\u2019 And the more specific and embarrassing, the more people seem to connect.\u201d During her show about gender and sexuality, she witnessed lots of teenagers coming out to their friends and family.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d3fadef21021e5c9b275e3d854a8ab99611bb21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d3fadef21021e5c9b275e3d854a8ab99611bb21/0_0_3840_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mae Martin and Charlotte Ritchie in Feel Good\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s a work of fiction. But it\u2019s got an emotional truth\u2019: Mae Martin and Charlotte Ritchie in Feel Good.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After one show, a girl approached Martin with her father, before turning to him and saying, \u2018Dad, I\u2019m bisexual.\u2019 \u201cAnd do you know what he replied? \u2018Me too.\u2019\u201d How did that feel? \u201cIt was cool! But I\u2019m not a licensed family therapist, so it was also quite scary. Especially because then they wanted to go out to a club. I was like, \u2018I\u2019m gonna pass.\u2019 With the next show, Dope, I saw a lot of addicts or people who have family members struggling with addictions. That was pretty wild. But I love it all.\u201d</p> <p>Last year she wrote a book for teenagers, a guide to 21st-century sexuality. \u201cI had to constantly remind people that I\u2019m just writing about my experiences. It\u2019s different for everyone \u2013 the most important thing is not to be squeamish. Talking about sexuality and gender right now is so politicised, but imagine being a teenager in your first relationship, and how stressful it would feel if you were seeing your identity debated on <em>Newsnight</em>. And so I try to take a lighter look, and remind people that it\u2019s supposed to be fun and also, that you don\u2019t have to feel pressured to pick a certain label.\u201d The book\u2019s title is <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/can-everyone-please-calm-down-9781526361653.html\" title=\"\">Can Everyone Please Calm Down?</a></em></p> <p>As well as belly laughs, Martin\u2019s audiences have become accustomed to feeling something slightly higher up: a light pressure on their heart, for example, or a tightening of the throat, or a small nudge on the brain. Her favourite comedians can, she says, \u201cDo both \u2013 be really hilarious while also sneaking in a social message.\u201d On stage she offers a critical analysis of contemporary obsessions, stories from her own life weaving through a theme, resulting in yes, punchlines, but also tight political conclusions \u2013 such as her insistence that we should eliminate labels like gay, straight, or bi.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everyone needs to take a deep breath and look at the facts and not the headlines</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m all for people identifying however they want. But I\u2019ve found that sometimes those labels bulldoze over nuance. My sexuality is not a huge part of who I am! It\u2019s not even a particularly interesting part. Apparently 40% of people under 25 don\u2019t identify as gay or straight any more. So I feel like that\u2019s where we are heading. If we just assume everyone\u2019s a bit gay, then we wouldn\u2019t have to go through that quite harrowing process of declaring yourself to be something else. Yeah, I see a lot of benefits to not expecting everyone to declare who they are.\u201d</p> <p>I wonder whether researching her own life for a show has brought up any surprising realisations. \u201cWell, one thing I found interesting is this false impression that gender fluidity or \u2018dismantling the gender binary\u2019 is a recent millennial fad, when, for centuries of human civilisation, there have been variances in gender. It\u2019s actually quite a recent western thing to have such a strict gender binary. In 2018, India decriminalised homosexuality, and we celebrated it over here. But, England went into India and criminalised homosexuality in 1856! It\u2019s the gaslighting that gets me. It\u2019s like setting somebody\u2019s house on fire and then going, \u2018Argh, it\u2019s taking me so long to put the fire out, like, it\u2019s <em>sooo</em> hard.\u201d</p> <p>She is fun to sit with. An afternoon discussing social politics with a comedian more brusque or earnest than Martin would be a slightly exhausting prospect. But she treads so lightly and with such conviction that the segues from her coconut allergy to the reaction to strap-on dildos in <em>Feel Good</em> to trans rights carry me gently and jollily through our conversation. It\u2019s only later, transcribing, that it strikes me how radical her post-identity politics might be.</p> <p>\u201cI totally understand people feeling overwhelmed, or feeling a sense of vertigo about how quickly things are changing. But everyone needs to take a deep breath and look at the facts and not the headlines.\u201d She searches quickly for an example from life. \u201cI remember when I first learned algebra and I got into this real angry panic because I was like, \u2018I just figured out numbers \u2013 and now they\u2019re introducing letters again?\u2019\u201d That was when she left school. \u201cI think that\u2019s the kind of thing people feel is happening now, and they\u2019re panicking. But it\u2019s actually not that confusing, if you listen properly.\u201d Then she says something that, in 2020, feels oddly like the most radical concept of all. Martin leans in. \u201cI\u2019m a big advocate of the idea that ambiguity, of the idea that not knowing\u201d \u2013 who you are, who you love, where to put your hands when you sleep, or why Bette Midler stirred such longing in a six-year-old Canadian child \u2013 \u201cis fine.\u201d Unexpectedly, I laugh.</p> <p><em>Feel Good starts on 18 March at 10pm on Channel 4</em></p>",
  "<p>I am a chef, but I don\u2019t \u201ccook\u201d that much. I shop really well and pretty much \u201cput together\u201d. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m lazy; come Sunday and I\u2019m cooking a ragu, or a roast chicken then stock with the carcass for the freezer, and so on. But as a working mum, I have to cut corners.

It\u2019s delicious served warm, so make it before dinner and place it in the oven while you\u2019re eating. When the spring blossom is out and the sun lasts longer these are the kind of gorgeous dishes I want to put on the table.</p> <h2>Fried polenta with broad beans</h2> <p>This would also be delicious with a runny egg or roasted tomatoes. <br><em>Serves 4</em></p> <p><strong>butter</strong> 25g, plus extra for the tin<br><strong>water </strong>750ml, salted<br><strong>polenta</strong> 250g<br><strong>parmesan</strong> 50g, grated, plus extra to serve<br><strong>broad beans </strong>1 kg (in shells) or 350g frozen beans<br><strong>olive oil<br>garlic </strong>2 cloves, thinly sliced<br><strong>baby spinach </strong>250g, washed<br><strong>salt </strong>and<strong> pepper<br>chilli flakes </strong>1 tsp<br><strong>thyme</strong> 3 sprigs<br><strong>lemon </strong>1, cut into 4 wedges<br><strong>extra virgin olive oil</strong></p> <p>Butter a 21 x 11 x 7cm loaf tin and set aside. Bring the salted water to a boil, add the polenta and cook until it is thick and clings to the spoon \u2013 about 10 minutes, but it will vary, so always check the instructions on the packet. Stir in the parmesan and butter until you have a smooth mixture. Pour the soft polenta mixture into the prepared tin and leave to cool and set for half an hour. This will keep for up to 5 days in the fridge.</p> <p>Have a bowl of ice water ready. Pod the beans if you are using fresh and bring a small saucepan of salted water to the boil. Drop the beans into the pan and cook for about 2 minutes, until they start to float. Drain the beans and add to the ice water, if the water has warmed up from the beans you can refresh the ice water. You can pop the skins off any larger beans, though this is more of a preference. Put the cold beans into a bowl, toss with a little olive oil and set aside.</p> <p>Heat a frying pan with 2 tbsp of olive oil, add the garlic and thyme and cook on a medium heat until the garlic begins to colour. Drop in the spinach and cook for a couple of minutes until wilted, stirring constantly. Season with salt, pepper and chilli flakes. Drizzle with oil, turn off the heat and leave the pan on the hob so it stays warm.</p> <p>Heat a nonstick or seasoned cast iron frying pan with 1 tbsp of olive oil and slice the polenta into 8. Fry until golden on each side (you may need more oil as you go). If you are using a smaller pan, you can keep the polenta warm in the oven.</p> <p>Divide the spinach between the plates, removing the thyme sprigs, and top with 2 slices of polenta. Spoon over the broad beans, drizzle with olive oil and finish with grated parmesan. Serve with a lemon wedge.</p> <h2>Kohlrabi and avocado salad</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8520242e65356c7525ee7b5add104edbb580047e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8520242e65356c7525ee7b5add104edbb580047e/0_3409_6192_3715/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crisp and fresh: kohlrabi and avocado salad.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crisp and fresh: kohlrabi and avocado salad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I first tried shaved kohlrabi at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/sep/15/gospel-of-st-john-a-restaurant-should-be-an-old-friend-fergus-henderson-trevor-gulliver\" title=\"\">St John</a> <a href=\"https://stjohnrestaurant.com/pages/bread-and-wine\" title=\"\">Bread and Wine</a>.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/07/sebastian-barry-family-stories-mean-a-while-dofferent-thing-when-you-are-60\" title=\"\">Sebastian Barry</a>\u2019s new play \u2013 his first in nearly a decade \u2013 has a major (and undisclosable) twist. It is a twist that is also a dare. The circumstances are improbable, the conclusion risks staining the action with sentimentality. To work, <strong><a href=\"https://trafalgar-studios.com/shows/on-blueberry-hill/\" title=\"\">On Blueberry Hill</a></strong> needs a leap of faith from the audience. I leapt.</p> <p>Two men in prison uniforms, perched or sprawling on bunk beds, deliver monologues. In Sabine Dargent\u2019s set, bright pages \u2013 the colour of the Gaelic Bible \u2013 dangle from the ceiling: the bunk beds are in a kind of limbo. Niall Buggy is canny and comic as the man who has said yes to everything from crane-driving (when he didn\u2019t know how) to women (when he had more than enough already). David Ganly is reflective as a former seminarian shaken by his love for another man, slowly coming to terms with the deed that has imprisoned him. They tell their stories separately. At first they meander through luscious recollections of childhood and mothers, and falling in love. Then comes acknowledgement from both that they have committed murder: one of them, in a singularly chilling admission, says he acted on what felt like a whim.</p> <p>Their stories converge. That strains credibility, but still more so does the movement in a short play from terrible violence to behaving like turtle doves. How does Barry pull it off? By giving us a new vocabulary in which to think about his characters. As they reminisce, they accidentally describe themselves and their circumstances. They are \u201charsh but radiant\u201d: like the woman, both adored and betrayed, who is \u201cshining with beauty\u201d and has an accent \u201cthat would mash spuds\u201d.</p> <p>Jim Culleton\u2019s rapt production for <a href=\"https://www.fishamble.com/\" title=\"\">Fishamble</a>, which has already been seen in Ireland (including Dublin\u2019s Mountjoy prison) and New York, wonderfully captures the idea of bullseye moments, of episodes of an electric awareness \u2013 the cell \u201cvibrates\u201d with the energy of the two men \u2013 but also a stately mythology, the bringing of shades to life.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/mar/01/katherine-parkinson-felicity-kendal-wellies-the-good-life-the-it-crowd-actor\">Katherine Parkinson: \u2018Felicity Kendal\u2019s wellies are big ones to fill\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>EV Crowe has come up with a terrific title. <strong><a href=\"https://royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/shoelady/\" title=\"\">Shoe Lady</a></strong> casts a shrewd glance at the way almost any noun slung in front of the word \u201clady\u201d becomes an insult: think \u201cbag\u201d, think \u201ccat\u201d \u2013 and compare \u201cbat man\u201d. She has also brought serious legwork and fancy footwork to the subject of one woman\u2019s unravelling. Shoes \u2013 on your uppers, well-heeled \u2013 are one of the quickest guides to status. And they carry a fairytale history of horror. I might like to think I\u2019d have been Cinderella but, lacking dainty feet, I\u2019d more likely be one of the Ugly Sisters, hacking off part of her heel to get it into the glass slipper. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auAYWfsV0OU\">Crowe</a> hints at all this in her story of an estate agent who loses a shoe and with it her equilibrium: she has for a time more in common with a street-dwelling cider drinker (also down to one shoe \u2013 a flattie) than with her boss, whose high heels are glimpsed under a lavatory door. She hobbles, her foot bleeds, she is \u201cshort of normal\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b4faca163eafb4a52bbdb21a4fde240ad8fc506\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b4faca163eafb4a52bbdb21a4fde240ad8fc506/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katherine Parkinson in Shoe Lady.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Losing a shoe and her equilibrium\u2019: Katherine Parkinson in Shoe Lady.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Harlan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/mar/01/katherine-parkinson-felicity-kendal-wellies-the-good-life-the-it-crowd-actor\" title=\"\">Katherine Parkinson</a>, for the most part alone on stage, is magnetic. Struggling not to be wild, she projects an almost fluorescent aureole of alarm. Sinking into darkness, she is often surrounded by hyper-brightness in Chloe Lamford\u2019s set and with Natasha Chivers\u2019s lighting. Director Vicky Featherstone keenly enhances the eeriness \u2013 and towards the end stages a musical number in the form of a wonderful trudging chant.</p> <p>There is plenty to intrigue but not enough to satisfy. The politics are insubstantial. Crowe has interestingly cited Arnold Wesker as an influence, alongside Caryl Churchill. A touch of Wesker-style documentary might have bolstered the episode with the rough sleeper. Disturbance sometimes fades into ditziness. And the account of the actual losing of the shoe is not detailed enough to convince a Londoner continually puzzled by seeing abandoned footwear everywhere.</p> <p>Buzzing with talent, raggedy in structure, <strong><a href=\"https://www.pilot-theatre.com/performance/crongton-knights\" title=\"\">Crongton Knights</a></strong> is the second in a series of plays co-produced by <a href=\"https://www.pilot-theatre.com/\" title=\"\">Pilot Theatre</a> and theatres in Coventry, Derby and York with the aim of staging mid-scale productions for young people.

The holy grail is a mobile phone; the \u201cdamsel\u201d in distress (she uses the word about herself) needs it back urgently from her bullying ex-boyfriend because he used it to store sex pictures of her.</p> <p>A number of contemporary difficulties are corralled on to the stage: one girl has escaped from Syria assuming but not knowing her father is dead; another is haunted by the shooting of her young cousin. The script interrupts the action every now and then to thump home various decent points about friendship, getting grief counselling, not carrying guns and knives. Trim some of this spelling-out and there is a fine, stirring event.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7918a76248d8be4ebc0542e520d5e815be12b168\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7918a76248d8be4ebc0542e520d5e815be12b168/0_290_4902_2941/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crongton Knights\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Buzzing with talent\u2019: the cast of Crongton Knights.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Day</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Simon Kenny has created a spot-on bunker-like set with swarming graffiti.

The cast pull together strongly, particularly in an imaginative cooking number, where they might be part of a giant food mixer. From the beginning Aimee Powell stands out for the sinuousness of her movement and her knockout voice, which is put to beautifully apt use: she sings of the need for independence without accompaniment, as if she is truly standing alone. Another remarkable voice is heard a little later: Kate Donnachie, less soulful, more troubled, snags at the heart \u2013 and goes to the heart of the project, pleading for acceptance by her peers and for complete individuality.</p> <p><em>Star ratings (out of five)<br>On Blueberry Hill</em> \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605<br><em>Shoe Lady</em> \u2605\u2605\u2605<br>C<em>rongton Knights</em> \u2605\u2605\u2605</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://trafalgar-studios.com/shows/on-blueberry-hill/\" title=\"\">On Blueberry Hill</a> is at the Trafalgar Studios, London, until 2 May<br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/shoelady/\" title=\"\">Shoe Lady</a> is at the Royal Court, London until 21 March<br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.pilot-theatre.com/performance/crongton-knights\" title=\"\">Crongton Knights</a> tours until 9 May</p>",

  "<p>At 82, Carley P Angell falls in the category for those at risk of serious illness if exposed to coronavirus. In two weeks, she could also end up in the same category as the tens of thousands in California who are at-risk and homeless.</p> <p>Public health officials are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/13/california-coronavirus-response-schools-disneyland\">issuing warnings</a> for those in her age range to stay home and self-isolate, but Angell and the 11 other seniors remaining at the Brookdale San Pablo assisted living facility still face eviction at the end of the month.</p> <p>\u201cWe are scared,\u201d Angell said. \u201cWe realize we are a very vulnerable population. We\u2019re the ones that coronavirus is hitting the hardest, and here we are, being forced out on to the streets with no place to go.\u201d</p> <p>When a global pandemic hits a state already gripped by a housing affordability crisis, the impact is both devastating and far-reaching. Those on the margins bear the brunt the hardest, forced to venture out to fight for their housing when public health warnings are discouraging people from social contact. \u201cWe\u2019re caught between anxiety and terror,\u201d Angell said. \u201cSome of us don\u2019t have places to go.

Self-quarantine without the option to work from home, or getting sick without paid sick leave could mean not being able to pay the bills. Fewer work shifts because no one is going out to eat, or a cancelled gig because the governor recommended postponing large gatherings could mean not being able to make rent. \u201cSo many of us are just one or two paychecks away from not being able to afford one of our basic needs, which is housing,\u201d said Lupe Arreola, the executive director of Tenants Together.</p> <p>In a state with 17m renters, more than 55% are cost-burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on rent.

It sounds crazy, but that\u2019s my plan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn this business, if you don\u2019t work you don\u2019t get paid,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you get paid time off.\u201d</p> <p>Local lawmakers and tenant advocates hope that measures like an eviction moratorium can help ease the minds of workers like Reagan. \u201cNo one should have to choose between their housing and their health,\u201d Arreola said.</p> <p>But besides being the ethical choice, prohibiting evictions is strategic in curbing the spread of the virus, Preston said.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the primary ways to prevent the spread of coronavirus is for folks to stay in their homes and if folks don\u2019t have a home to go to, that\u2019s impossible,\u201d he said.</p> <p>That\u2019s why Angell and the seniors at Brookdale San Pablo are petitioning California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, to issue a moratorium on all evictions, coronavirus-related or otherwise, until the crisis passes.</p> <p>The seniors at Brookdale San Pablo were alerted at the end of November that Brookdale, a national senior-living company, was not renewing its lease. They thought that maybe another company that specialized in assisted living would take over, but in January, they received eviction notices from the building\u2019s owner \u2013 around the time coronavirus began to spread in China.</p> <p>There were 83 of them originally, and some left, forced to move farther away from their doctors and their families.

They hope that the governor or the building\u2019s owner will let them stay, at least until they\u2019re out of danger of exposure.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no place like this nearby at this price or at this quality,\u201d Angell said. \u201cThey\u2019re putting us out on the streets.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>My entertainment options this week were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/12/the-hunt-movie-behind-elites-v-deplorables-thriller\">a movie</a> in which \u201cliberal elites\u201d hunt down and murder \u201cdeplorables\u201d for sport \u2013 deaths that are ultra gory and played for laughs \u2013 and a Hulu documentary in which Hillary Clinton explains with a chuckle and a smile why the policies supported by her 2016 opponent, Bernie Sanders \u2013 policies like universal healthcare and prison reform, which would help countless Americans \u2013 are just not \u201cdoable\u201d. In other words, essentially the same thing.</p> <p>The Hunt was supposed to be released last fall, but it was put on hold after some people wondered if a movie about political polarity and divisiveness in contemporary society, in which a bunch of poor people die violently was really going to be a good idea. Released now, the controversy is its main selling point. And \u2013 since we are in the beginning stages of a pandemic for which the United States is not remotely prepared and in which the uninsured, elderly, and poor are much more likely to die \u2013 well, let\u2019s just say the timing creates a certain tone.</p> <p>The co-writer and producer Damon Lindelof \u2013 who recently read the legendary anti-fascist comic Watchmen and thought, huh, okay, but <a href=\"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/dr-manhattan-cop-watchmen-frantz-fanon/\">what if instead we made the cops the heroes</a>? \u2013 has created a world where a group of rich, NPR-listening liberals, who bicker about gendered language and whether \u201cblack\u201d or \u201cAfrican-American\u201d is the more acceptable term, drug, abduct, and murder Trump voters for sport. One of the Trump voters actually isn\u2019t a Trump voter but is brought there by mistake, and not being a redneck hillbilly idiot, she manages to fight back. I think that\u2019s a metaphor. For something.</p> <p>Ultimately the film wants to pretend to be a commentary on cancel culture and our new culture wars. It turns out the whole plan for liberal elites to hunt deplorables becomes a reality because deplorables can\u2019t take a joke about liberal elites hunting deplorables. The slapstick deaths are supposed to indicate that hey, we\u2019re just playing around here, rather than show a callous disregard for human life on the part of the film-makers. And if you don\u2019t find it funny to watch a woman impaled on spikes or a man blown up on a landmine or a woman choking to death after she\u2019s poisoned, you must be one of those humorless cancel culture freaks who need to learn to take a joke.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/12/the-hunt-movie-behind-elites-v-deplorables-thriller\">'It's a fun movie, I promise': behind the elites v 'deplorables' thriller The Hunt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But of course if you\u2019re from and of the coasts it\u2019s easy to believe these new culture wars are just about a difference of opinion about gun control or abortion and not about the hopelessness and loss of meaning and instability causing <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/06/opinion/working-class-death-rate.html\">the deaths of despair</a> killing white middle Americans without college degrees through suicide and addiction. It\u2019s similar to how one segment of the population will remember the culture wars of the 1990s as a discussion about whether a crucifix of Jesus Christ submerged in urine should be considered art, and not about whether the thousands of gay people, IV drug users, hemophiliacs, and others deemed ultimately disposable by the government and society should have been allowed to die from Aids. Or as a debate about whether children should be exposed to vulgarity in music, and not about whether black people or people in poor neighborhoods should be murdered, brutalized, and harassed by the police forces that claim to protect them.</p> <p>It\u2019s not clear that anyone involved with this film has ever even been to the south. The star, Betty Gilpin, plays a working-class woman named Crystal who spends the entirety of the film holding her jaw as if she is trying not to let any spit from the chewing tobacco dribble out, and yet at no time does she partake in chewing tobacco. It\u2019s like she saw a picture of someone once and thought, Oh, that must be how they do it down there, but no one explained to her it\u2019s not just that all southerners have a severe underbite. But then no one involved in the production thought it might be weird for the action of the film to play out in Croatia, a country still dealing with the aftermath of its own \u2026 uh, let\u2019s call it political polarity and divisiveness, I guess.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure the millionaires who endorsed billionaire Mike Bloomberg in the Democratic primaries will watch this movie on their private jets and have a good chuckle at the depiction of clueless and out-of-touch elites heading to Croatia on their private plane with a cargo full of white trash. \u201cOh my God, that\u2019s so us! I also enjoy a little caviar snack while on my way to my private manor in the Balkans.\u201d And then they\u2019ll go back to deciding which underprivileged group should receive their charity this month \u2013 instead of just paying their taxes, which could fund an adequate public healthcare system that would keep people from having to beg online to afford chemotherapy.</p> <p>Cinemas across the US are currently closing because of coronavirus; perhaps only the elites who can afford private screenings of The Hunt in their palatial estates will be able to see it. In the meantime, the rest of us are about to go on quarantine lockdown, forced to sustain ourselves on whatever mediocre bilge Netflix has put out this week. I think that\u2019s a metaphor.

  "<p>In a conflict often called the \u201cforgotten war\u201d, one Yemeni city feels most forgotten of all.</p> <p>\u201cI want the whole world to know about Taiz,\u201d declares Mohammed Saleh al-Qaisi. \u201cI want them to see what Taiz was, and what\u2019s happening now.\u201d We\u2019re sitting on a step on a street buzzing with motorcycles and the tinkle of bicycle bells. A few shops away, young men drinking hot sweet tea cradle rifles in their laps and wave at passersby. Above them, a billboard advertises books from Cambridge University Press and McGraw-Hill.</p> <p>Yemen\u2019s third-largest city was once known as its capital of culture. Taizis prided themselves on producing the best-educated people who became the best teachers, lawyers, pilots, you name it. Now it is known as Yemen\u2019s longest-running battlefield, the most heavily bombed by blistering Saudi airstrikes, the deadliest governorate in Yemen\u2019s devastating war. The conflict, which enters its sixth year this month, pits the Houthis aligned to Iran against Yemen\u2019s government backed by a Saudi-led coalition supported by western military powers.</p> <p>And Taiz has had its own combustible mix of infighting among rival groups armed by the coalition, including political Islamists and hardline Salafists comprising gunmen accused of links to al-Qaida.</p> <p>\u201cI know what this city was. I know what I went to school for,\u201d Qaisi says, his eyes watering.</p> <p>Attention to Taiz\u2019s plight has been eclipsed by alarm over the fate of more strategic battlefields, including the contested Red Sea port city of Hodeida. The last major effort to push Yemen away from war in December 2018, in UN-brokered negotiations outside Stockholm, only reached an \u201cunderstanding\u201d on the need to talk about Taiz. It didn\u2019t go any further.</p> <p>And adding Taiz to Yemen\u2019s long shopping list has made it even harder. \u201cNow its fate is linked to a much bigger picture in a three-dimensional chess game,\u201d says Peter Salisbury of the International Crisis Group.</p> <p>In recent weeks, after one of the quietest periods in this war, there\u2019s been an upsurge in fighting on key frontlines across Yemen.</p> <p>Taiz is a city split in two, an ugly emblem of the wider conflict tearing a whole country apart. From the top of Jabal Sabir, the city\u2019s towering mountain, inside the hollow pockmarked shell of what was once a prized tourist resort, there\u2019s a dazzling view. A vista that once drew visitors now provides the best vantage point to understand Taiz\u2019s political topography.</p> <p>The frontline slashes through the city from east to west, leaving a visible green and brown scar. Greenery has spread like tentacles across the no man\u2019s land. Beyond this line, about a third of Taiz is in the hands of Houthis who control the heights overlooking the northern edge of the city. The rest is run by the government. Close up, it\u2019s a seam crackling with tension.</p> <p>After securing permission from the head of a neighbourhood committee on the government side, whose members identify themselves as the \u201cresistance\u201d, we descend winding steps, sheltered by dark shadows and stone walls riddled with bullet holes, to a largely deserted lane.</p> <p>\u201cMy family is hiding at home,\u201d one of our escorts, in a Yemeni patterned turban and traditional \u201cfuta\u201d skirt, says as we hang back a bit from the open street. \u201cWhoever goes out gets shot by the Houthis.\u201d</p> <p>Families are caught in the crosshairs of both sides. War bestowed a new title on Taiz: \u201ccity of snipers\u201d.</p> <p>From where we stand, we see how life has been pulled from homes facing the line of fire. Building facades are like mournful faces of black-eyed windows and gaping holes.</p> <p>Another man hurries past. \u201cThere\u2019s only one street between my home and the Houthis,\u201d he says, pointing the other way as he catches his breath. \u201cMy family was so scared they left.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/archive-2-zip/giv-3902cwVui1f8F15P/\" data-alt=\".\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/archive-2-zip/giv-3902cwVui1f8F15P/\">.</a> </figure>  <p>Beyond this alley, daily life is a battle. All roads in and out of Taiz, except one, are controlled by the Houthis.</p> <p>\u201cWe were invited to cross to the other side for talks but clashes broke out and both sides shot at us,\u201d recalls Abdul Kareen Shaiban with a grimace as he remembers a negotiating effort years ago. An MP who chairs a roads committee, he\u2019s talked many times over many years to both sides.</p> <p>We\u2019re standing on what was once a bustling main road running though Taiz, which connected it to other major cities including the capital Sana\u2019a in the north. A few goats pick their way down the carriageway and a little boy furiously pedals past on his beat-up bicycle. We can see the rusted metal barriers overgrown with shrubbery blocking the road a short distance away. \u201cPeople inside this city have nothing to do with politics or war. They just simply want to live and they need a road,\u201d Shaiban says.</p> <p>\u201cThe siege has made life difficult and deadly,\u201d chimes in Dalia Nasr of another initiative, Taizi Women for Life. She knows the danger \u2013 a sniper\u2019s bullet blinded her in one eye. Her aunt, two brothers and a nephew were killed during clashes.</p> <p>Nasr explains how blocking the roads splits life in two: patients with chronic illnesses are separated from specialised hospitals; students can\u2019t make it to their universities; workers living on the government side can\u2019t reach factories mainly concentrated in the area under Houthi control.</p> <p>Getting to the other side of Taiz used to be a five-minute drive. Now it takes more than five hours.</p> <p>We take this route, which hugs mountains with breathtaking sheer drops, bumps along a dirt track through soaring palm trees and runs through checkpoints manned by rival groups. We weren\u2019t given permission by the Houthi authorities to spend time on the other side.</p> <p>Everyone we meet in Taiz remembers what happened to them as if it was yesterday. \u201cNo one pays attention to us,\u201d says Marwan with palpable anger. We\u2019re standing in the rubble of his home, where 10 relatives died as they slept in an airstrike by the Saudi-led coalition. It happened five years ago. The house, and Marwan, are still in pieces.</p> <p>\u201cTo this day we\u2019ve received no explanation from the local authorities or the army or the coalition,\u201d he says. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know why they hit a neighbourhood full of civilians.\u201d</p> <p>Airstrikes by the coalition \u2013 often with UK- or US-made bombs \u2013 have caused the most civilian casualties in Taiz, and other battlefields across Yemen, according to figures compiled by the UN and other data sources including Acled (Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project).</p> <p>\u201cThe attack was so aggressive it took us six days to find the body parts,\u201d Marwan recalls. \u201cWe looked for them in nearby houses, on the streets and on the roofs.\u201d Eight of his neighbours perished in the same attack.</p> <p>A Yemeni government official accompanying us insists we also visit a home destroyed by the Houthis.</p> <p>We\u2019re greeted by a gaggle of children. A little girl in a red velvet dress, braids sticking out like a Yemeni Pippa Longstocking, starts chattering about the attack that killed her playmate next door. The boy\u2019s mother, Zahra, soon arrives with graphic photographs of that fateful day. Their home is still a mess of shattered windows and walls.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone sold Yemen for their own benefit,\u201d Zahra declares bitterly. \u201cThe Houthis work with Iran, half the resistance works with Saudi Arabia, the other half with the United Arab Emirates.\u201d It\u2019s a lament not just about the main warring parties, but also skirmishes between local forces trained and armed by Arab states in the coalition. Zahra\u2019s story is the story of Yemen\u2019s war. Her youngest son died in the first strike, her older son was later shot dead, a daughter lost an eye and her husband went mad with grief. \u201cThey see this huge crisis happening to us and no one does anything.\u201d</p> <p>When we leave, Zahra hurries after us with freshly baked Yemeni bread \u2013 a reminder, if one was needed, that even this merciless war can\u2019t completely crush a kind and cultured people.</p> <p><em>Lyse Doucet is the BBC\u2019s </em><em>chief </em><em>international </em><em>correspondent and a presenter for BBC World News and BBC World Service</em></p>",
  "<p>Amid a global pandemic, Hong Kong\u2019s famously crowded streets are eerily quiet. Most of the city\u2019s 7.5m people have been practising various forms of social distancing for months.</p> <p>Shops and restaurants are empty, already struggling in a recession after nine months of teetering on the brink of revolution.</p> <p>It\u2019s a far cry from last year when one in four people took to the streets in protest marches that stretched for kilometres, tightly packed between the towering highrises.</p> <p>In Hong Kong the coronavirus, which causes the Covid-19 illness, has infected about 130 people.</p> <p>It\u2019s an extraordinarily low number, given Hong Kong\u2019s proximity to mainland China, where the outbreak started. The city learned hard lessons during the Sars outbreak of 2003, when 299 Hong Kongers died.</p> <p>After a rocky start, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/mass-testing-alerts-and-big-fines-the-strategies-used-in-asia-to-slow-coronavirus\">the response to Covid-19 has been comprehensive</a> \u2013 schools and public attractions have been closed for months, and there are tight restrictions and laws on incoming travellers. Working from home is common, as is the enthusiasm for wearing masks, avoiding germs, and staying away from public gatherings.</p> <p>There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/mass-testing-alerts-and-big-fines-the-strategies-used-in-asia-to-slow-coronavirus\">tentative talk that containment efforts are working</a> and because of that, there is also speculation over what this means for the protesters who spent months demonstrating against Hong Kong\u2019s authorities.</p> <p>The protests were sparked by an extradition bill which would have allowed suspected or accused criminals to be sent to mainland China. It went to the heart of Hong Kong concerns about the region\u2019s impending return to Beijing control in 2047, and current intrusions on their freedom and democracy.</p> <p>The bill was eventually withdrawn but not before the protests escalated and four new demands were made: true universal suffrage for Hong Kongers, an inquiry into police brutality, amnesty for arrested protesters, and a retraction of the government\u2019s classification of protesters as \u201crioters\u201d.</p> <p>Only one of the movement\u2019s five demands have been met and members are still subject to waves of crackdowns.</p> <p>\u201cI think the government is gaining confidence that it is getting better control over the situation and is gradually prodding to see how far it can go with its crackdown,\u201d says Kong Tsung-gan, a writer, educator and activist who participated in the Umbrella movement.</p> <p>\u201cQuestion one is when and if people will feel that the coronavirus epidemic is under control. My sense is that the period of panic is over and confidence is growing.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew Junker, honorary assistant professor with The Chinese University of Hong Kong\u2019s sociology department, says the protests \u201clost steam\u201d, due to both the virus seizing public attention and the movement reaching something of a peak in November, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/28/hong-kong-police-enter-campus-despite-pleas-from-protesters\">the traumatic university sieges</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/24/hong-kong-residents-turn-up-for-local-elections-in-record-numbers\">success of pro-democracy candidates at the local elections</a>.</p> <p>Even before then, protests had entered a new phase which turned away some of the public, evolving from mass public marches to \u201cwarrior style disobedience\u201d \u2013 short, sharp, unauthorised protests seeking to provoke police into overreactions which would drive support and media attention to the movement.</p> <p>A social media administrator of a popular protest-update account tells the Guardian they and friends remained committed to getting back out on the streets.</p> <p>\u201cTo us, of course protecting ourselves from the coronavirus is vital. But when it comes to seeing our home being destroyed by tyranny in every way possible, values we have been upholding are twisted and devastated, the virus seems too minor an issue to hinder us from guarding our home,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cWe will never back off. We are willing to do everything to fight against injustice and expose the truth even if our efforts seemed small and powerless.\u201d</p> <p>There is widespread acceptance that the fear of infection at mass gatherings has played a part in the diminished numbers.</p> <p>However it has also driven its own protests.</p> <p>The already low support and trust in the Hong Kong government and chief executive, Carrie Lam, were compounded by early missteps in responding to the virus.</p> <p>\u201cThe wrong and inefficient allocation of resources [eg masks] and slow border closures incited hatred in our community too,\u201d the administrator says, in reference to protests and strikes over Lam\u2019s reluctance to close borders or place restrictions on travellers from mainland China.</p> <p>\u201cIf the government had closed the border, we could have been able to stop the epidemic spreading in Hong Kong even more effectively.\u201d</p> <p>Kong says the policing of protests during the outbreak has been \u201cmore oppressive than ever\u201d.</p> <p>Alleged police brutality and mass arrests continue, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/hong-kong-media-tycoon-jimmy-lai-arrested-on-charges-of-illegal-assembly\">three high-profile pro-democracy figures</a> on charges which observers said could apply to almost any protester, as well as hundreds of others at smaller events since.</p> <p>Last Sunday, police were filmed pepper-spraying journalists and bystanders at a demonstration against the establishment of a Covid-19 clinic in a high-density residential area. Just hours later they were again accused of excessive force in trying to shut down a vigil for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/08/hong-kong-protests-student-who-fell-from-parking-lot-during-demonstrations-dies\">a young man who died when he fell from a car park during a protest in November</a>.</p> <p>On Wednesday the US State Department accused the Hong Kong government of an <a href=\"https://www.hongkongfp.com/2020/03/12/hong-kong-govt-warns-foreign-interference-us-report-details-human-rights-concerns\">\u201capparent unwillingness to criticise the police force\u201d</a> or investigate alleged breaches of civil liberties. Hong Kong dismissed the report as foreign interference.</p> <p>Albert Ho, a solicitor and high-profile pro-democracy politician in Hong Kong, says it is clear there have been fewer confrontations and clashes since the virus, and authorities appear to be using the quiet time to round up key figures and organisers.</p> <p>\u201cI think they have come to a stage where they can say they have clamped down on these movements by the youngsters,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cSo they have to do everything to deter the social organisers from continuing to organise marches and demonstrations on a big scale.\u201d</p> <p>Views differ within the movement on whether another organised, police-approved rally could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/18/hong-kong-huge-rally-china-condemns-us-gross-interference\">draw people out in their millions again</a>.</p> <p>Junker says it looks like the movement is now trying to re-energise, but there\u2019s \u201ca lot of fatalism at this point, saying nothing is working\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe government has all the resources and institutional levers to follow up in these retributional ways.\u201d</p> <p>But it\u2019s hard to predict.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a weird kind of effervescent chemistry where [if] the right things converge and boom, you have two million people out on the street.\u201d</p> <p>Kong says: \u201cOne thing is certain \u2013 distrust and anger with the government has only grown, and people\u2019s views haven\u2019t changed: we\u2019re sick of an unrepresentative and unresponsive government. We want democracy. How that manifests itself is hard to say.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>There has been a huge difference in how the coronavirus pandemic has evolved in different countries. Some have gone nearly two months with just a few dozen cases; others have seen an outbreak explode in weeks.</p> <p>The statistics about the early evolution of cases can be confusing, because some countries were slow to test or late to announce results. Italy\u2019s first case was at the end of January, but the disease is thought to have been circulating there from the middle of the month. Likewise the steep rise of cases in Iran suggests it was spreading long before the first positive test.</p> <p>Many of the countries that have had the greatest success in containing the disease are ones that were affected by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/24/lessons-from-sars-outbreak-help-in-race-for-coronavirus-vaccine\" title=\"\">Sars in 2002-03</a>. The memory of that crisis may have led to better preparedness, in government and among the population, and to a greater willingness among people to comply with restrictions on movement and daily life to prevent the spread of infection.</p> <p>There are three main aspects to controls that aim to stop the spread of the disease. The first is travel bans on people from areas with high levels of cases (initially mainland China, now many more places); the second is quarantine rules to prevent known or suspected carriers from spreading infection; and the third is shutdowns and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-uk-action-plan-poised-for-social-distancing-phase\" title=\"\">social distancing</a> to prevent transmission between unidentified carriers by reducing human contact.</p> <p>Below we take a look at some of the worst-affected countries, and the most successful at containing coronavirus so far. China has not been included, because its circumstances are an outlier. But it is another example of how quarantine requirements, and strict controls on movement and social interaction, can dramatically curb the spread of the disease. On Friday it had only eight new cases, the first time that number has fallen into single digits since the outbreak began.</p> <p>Initially, Italy did little to stop the spread of coronavirus. After it registered more deaths than any other country outside China, and the scale of the crisis became clear, it locked down first the northern region at the centre of the crisis and then the entire country.</p> <p>Schools and universities have closed, along with all shops except supermarkets and pharmacies. Restaurants and bars are closed to customers, although they can make home deliveries. Sports events and outdoor gatherings are banned.</p> <p>Permission is required if travel is vital for medical, work or personal reasons.</p> <h2>Iran</h2> <p>After announcing the first cases (and deaths) in late February, Iran did nothing about coronavirus \u2013 perhaps because the government felt it could not afford to offend China, a vital partner for the isolated country. Flights between Iran and China continued, and Iran donated a million face masks to China. Even after the toll began to rise rapidly, and senior politicians tested positive, health workers in small hospitals did not initially use protective gear.</p> <p>Now schools have been closed and most Friday prayer services are cancelled. People have been urged to self-isolate, and the government has warned it may use force to prevent internal travel. The country has dug mass graves to bury the dead.</p> <h2>South Korea</h2> <p>The country\u2019s most important tool in fighting coronavirus has been its testing system; South Korea has run far more tests per capita than any other country \u2013 and nearly 10 times more than in the UK.</p> <p>Many of those tested are members of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/were-treated-like-criminals-south-korean-sect-feels-coronavirus-backlash\" title=\"\">Shincheonji religious sect</a>, whose members in Daegu city account for more than half of cases. There are 53 drive-through testing stations, allowing people to check their illness without physical contact.</p> <p>Other measures include cancelling major events, and asking people to stay away from Daegu. The start of a new school term has been delayed from 2 March to the 22nd. Emergency childcare in classes of no more than 10 is offered for those who must go to work. Home working has been encouraged, with subsidies for companies that offer employees the flexibility to manage new care responsibilities.</p> <p>GPS maps, available online to the public, track the movements of anyone confirmed to have the virus. South Korea also screens passengers leaving the country.</p> <p>Widespread testing meant a jump in confirmed cases, currently more than 7,800, but resulted in a very low mortality rate, below 1%. New daily cases are down from a peak two weeks ago, and on Friday the country reported more recoveries than new cases, for the first time since the outbreak began.</p> <h2>Taiwan</h2> <p>Despite its closeness to China, physically and in economic terms, Taiwan has had extraordinary success in controlling the coronavirus. Efforts may have been helped by the Sars experience, and the fact that the vice-president is an epidemiologist.</p> <p>Taiwan was probably the first country to try to stop coronavirus spreading, bringing in checks on travellers from Wuhan at the end of December, after reports of a mystery, pneumonia-like illness.</p> <p>A command centre for epidemics kicked into action in late January, producing new policies and monitoring virus-tracking and treatment efforts. Wider travel restrictions on people coming from mainland China were introduced despite the insistence of the World Health Organization (WHO) that they were not necessary. Extensive testing and contact-tracing through the public health system prevented the disease spreading.</p> <p>School holidays were extended during late February, and schools can be closed again if cases emerge among students.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fa72a3c122fbcdaa95af406c835b453c358ff76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fa72a3c122fbcdaa95af406c835b453c358ff76/0_334_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coronavirus testing in a laboratory in Singapore.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coronavirus testing in a laboratory in Singapore.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edgar Su/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Singapore</h2> <p>Travel restrictions on people coming from mainland China were put in place, going beyond WHO advice. An exhaustive testing regime covered anyone with flu-like or pneumonia symptoms. All possible contacts of those infected were tracked, involving the police, flight manifests and a local test for antibodies that circulate after an infection clears.</p> <p>Tests are free, and a huge public information campaign has urged even people with mild symptoms to see a doctor. The government covers medical bills for suspected or confirmed cases, so there are no financial risks to getting tested.</p> <p>Self-employed people get a quarantine allowance, and employers are banned from deducting days in isolation from annual leave.</p> <p>Measures can also be punitive, with one couple prosecuted for providing false travel history.</p> <h2>Hong Kong</h2> <p>Most border crossings with mainland China have been closed, and people arriving from there must quarantine for 14 days.</p> <p>Schools and universities closed in mid-January, and most remain shut, although a few private schools have partly reopened. Working from home has been encouraged where possible. Museums and sports facilities are shut, and people told to avoid large gatherings.</p> <p>Those with strong memories of Sars have voluntarily stayed home when they can, and used masks and hand sanitiser when they have to go out.</p> <p>The measures have also brought a drop in seasonal flu cases.</p>",

With doubt surrounding the continuation of the league, the Phoenix are proposing to spend at least six-straight weeks in Australia in pursuit of a maiden title.</p> <p>Wellington will host Melbourne Victory on Sunday at Sky Stadium, hours before travel restrictions take effect at midnight on both sides of the Tasman. Phoenix general manager David Dome said his third-placed team had all but bought into playing out their campaign on Australian soil under extraordinary circumstances. They couldn\u2019t play for 14 days while undergoing mandatory isolation, and then would have an intense run of games, probably in empty stadiums.</p> <p>Wellington would be unable to play road games scheduled next week, against Sydney FC on Wednesday and Newcastle on Sunday. They would bank on FFA rescheduling both games, while two matches - which were to have been played in Wellington in April - would need to be relocated to Australia.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to capitulate and not play out. We had to play out; we had to do our best to get into the finals series,\u201d Dome said. \u201cThe disappointing thing for us is that the fans won\u2019t be there to enjoy it.\u201d</p> <p>Dome said the team would likely self-isolate in central Sydney accommodation and emerge only for controlled training sessions. Dome said players would have the choice to commit to a full Australian stay of at least six weeks.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to force players to go. We won\u2019t mandate it because there are some players with families. There are some players who are expecting children and do we really want to take them away from their newborn babies?\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6dc3ee8f088d757559398a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-15T06:01:36.177Z\">6.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Super Rugby: Brumbies 21-14 Waratahs at half-time</strong></p> <p>Meanwhile in the code where trying scoring is usually much less frequent, there has been a bit of a try-fest down in Canberra in a high scoring first half between these two old foes.

  "<p>The recent, turbulent history of the Dick family reads like a Netflix reboot of <em>Bleak House</em>. For this is the tale of an unending court case involving the recent sale of a fabulous mansion in one of Britain\u2019s better known tax havens, home to a man whose rags-to-riches life could have been penned by Charles Dickens.</p> <p>John W Dick was raised in Canada as a Mennonite \u2013 a Christian sect whose members live humble, God-fearing lives.</p> <p>It\u2019s a long way from the rarefied world he inhabits now. Today the 82-year-old tycoon rubs shoulders with business titans and political leaders and lives a life of immense luxury. He is a director of media giant Liberty Global, which owns Virgin Media, and an honorary consul for the Rwandan government.</p> <p>Dick \u2013 tall, bald and charismatic \u2013 has lived in St John\u2019s Manor, described as the finest house on Jersey, for more than 40 years. Until recently he was also the Seigneur of St John, a feudal title that carried privileges, including the right to execute servants.</p> <p>But instead of enjoying his twilight years in regal style, the multimillionaire is locked in an extraordinarily messy legal feud with his daughter by his first marriage, Tanya Dick-Stock, and her husband, Darrin Stock, a US businessman.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e727965b7b8202819ca95139f2c63ccd0e69d62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e727965b7b8202819ca95139f2c63ccd0e69d62/0_0_6547_5854/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vintage engraving from 1880 of Jersey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"894\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vintage engraving from 1880 of Jersey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Father v daughter: the claims and counter-claims<br><br></h2> <p>Few things about the feud are clear. Dick-Stock alleges that her father, abetted by others, has defrauded family trusts \u2013 offshore vehicles used to protect assets from the taxman \u2013 of which she is a beneficiary, of tens of millions of pounds. She is also heavily critical of the way the Jersey authorities and its financial services industry have investigated her claims.</p> <p>Dick vigorously disputes his daughter\u2019s allegations. He regards her and her husband as \u201cwholly unreliable\u201d and untrustworthy, citing, among other things, both criticism she received in a Jersey court and the number of court proceedings in which the couple are involved in the US. </p> <p>Dick\u2019s lawyers also say his daughter does not have the authority to bring the case against her father as the company bringing the action is in receivership, and therefore litigation should be controlled by the receiver.</p> <p>They point out that none of the trusts\u2019 other beneficiaries, including her own brother, John Dick II, share her views. The entire Dick family, not just Tanya, has been the victim of an audacious fraud, they say.</p> <p>Lawyers for Dick-Stock deny allegations that she is untrustworthy and insist she is entitled to bring a separate personal claim against her father.</p> <p>A spokesman for Dick-Stock said the case was due to be heard on 6 July.</p> <p>This may seem just a story about a wealthy family\u2019s spectacular implosion in a British Crown Dependency that prizes its independence from the mainland: think <em>Bergerac</em> meets <em>Succession</em>. But the father-daughter battle which, until now, has gone largely unreported, affords a rare glimpse of how the secretive offshore trust system, set up to protect assets from the taxman, can be exploited for fraudulent purposes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8930118a4f6512f4e2a0db5fa27d8693874d196\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8930118a4f6512f4e2a0db5fa27d8693874d196/0_90_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tanya Dick-Stock and Darrin Stock.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tanya Dick-Stock and Darrin Stock.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Indeed, while there is now almost nothing upon which Dick and his daughter do agree, both believe that a massive fraud has been perpetrated in Jersey, the scale of which has yet to be truly appreciated. Some view the row as a wake-up call for the island.</p> <p>Lurking in the shadows, out of sight of regulators and law enforcement, the offshore trust system appears ripe for manipulation, with beneficiaries often unaware of how their assets are being used. Anonymous trusts that are trustees of other trusts based in different tax havens shuffle money and assets around like cards, using them as security for loans.</p> <p>Frank Casey, the financial analyst who blew the whistle on the <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/madoff/interviews/casey.html\" title=\"\">Bernie Madoff scandal</a>, drew comparisons between the conditions under which the disgraced financier was able to operate his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/16/ponzi-madoff-business-scams\" title=\"\">ponzi scheme</a> and the way the system functions in tax havens around the world.</p> <p>\u201cThe similarities are really striking,\u201d Casey said. \u201cThe basic elements are a lack of transparency and no reportability.\u201d</p> <p>This in turn raises an important question: if trusts\u2019 beneficiaries are not always aware of what is happening to their assets, what hope is there for external regulators and law enforcement agencies trying to stop them being used to launder money for kleptocrats, mobsters and drug cartels?</p> <p>The clearest indication that there was trouble in paradise came last month when St John\u2019s Manor was sold after languishing for two years on the market, the asking price having been <a href=\"https://jerseyeveningpost.com/news/2020/02/18/st-johns-manor-sold-after-two-years-on-the-market/\" title=\"\">slashed from \u00a322m to a reported \u00a317.5m</a>.</p> <p>The estate agent\u2019s sales brochure describes the 11,000 sq ft pile, which dates back to the 14th century, as having \u201cmagnificent\u201d landscaped grounds, a \u201cstunning\u201d Japanese water garden, stables, a swimming pool, a squash court and a falconry. It also has a chapel where Tanya and Darrin were married and underneath which Dick intends to be buried.</p> <p>Dick-Stock alleges that, down the years, Dick family trusts have had claims over St John\u2019s Manor as well as other properties including flats in St Petersburg, Jersey and Mayfair, a farm, a fleet of luxury cars and even a vintage doll collection.</p> <p>She also claims to have seen documents that show the trusts once owned a Botticelli painting worth an estimated $20m, a claim categorically denied by her father.</p> <p>But it is the fabulous house that is at the centre of the row. Both father and daughter agree that St John\u2019s Manor was used to fraudulently secure a \u00a36.5m loan from HSBC Jersey. It is claimed that a trustee of the Dick family trusts, an obscure offshore services company called PanTrust, played a key role in the alleged fraud before misappropriating the HSBC loan.</p> <p>If true, PanTrust\u2019s actions run counter to everything a trustee \u2013 a person or body who has a duty to protect a trust\u2019s assets \u2013 is supposed to do, in this case represent the interests of the entire Dick family.</p> <h2>The Panama connection and the shady financial adviser<br><br></h2> <p>But then PanTrust is not your average trustee. The company featured prominently in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers\" title=\"\">Panama Papers</a>, the massive leak of confidential documents from law firm Mossack Fonseca that revealed how hundreds of wealthy individuals and companies had parked their money offshore, in some cases illegally.</p> <p>Banned from operating by the Panamanian regulator in February 2015, PanTrust was found to have set up a complex ponzi scheme in which scores of fake accounts were paying fictitious rates of interest with the results that scores of trusts were fleeced of millions of pounds.</p> <p>The Panamanian regulator also ruled that the firm had failed in its duty to prevent money-laundering and terrorist financing. To this day it has the distinction of being the only company in Panama to ever lose its trust licence.</p> <p>PanTrust was run by a man called Richard Wigley, who managed Dick\u2019s financial affairs for 30 years until his fraudulent acts were discovered. And it is the relationship between the two men that is now at the centre of the dispute between father and daughter. Was Wigley acting independently of Dick or, as his daughter insists, on his behalf?</p> <p>A Royal Court of Jersey judgment refers to a memo prepared by Wigley which claimed that Dick would receive a share of PanTrust\u2019s income. But Dick\u2019s representatives insist that he has never received an income from PanTrust. They say that it was Dick who drew PanTrust to the attention of the Panamanian regulator and that Wigley abused his position and defrauded the Dick family over three decades.</p> <p>It was during court proceedings to have him removed as a trustee that Wigley\u2019s lawyers made a bombshell admission. They acknowledged that he had created 24 fraudulent loans worth $30m involving a series of trusts set up for the Dick family.</p> <p>Then events took an even more extraordinary turn.</p> <p>According to Dick-Stock\u2019s legal action against her father, filed in 2018 in the district court, Denver County, Colorado, where one of the family trusts was established, it was only after Wigley had been removed as a trustee that she claims she discovered \u201cJohn W Dick was not a victim of \u2026 Wigley, but instead a confederate\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen she suspected her father it was like <em>Friday the 13th</em>, when the mask slips and you find out who Jason really is,\u201d Stock said.</p> <p>To say Dick denies the claim would be a serious understatement. A representative said: \u201cJohn Dick and his family dispute the entirety of Tanya\u2019s alternative history.\u201d</p> <p>Last June, the Dick-Stocks wrote to HSBC Jersey, informing it that the Jersey police and the US authorities had been alerted to allegations that the loan against St John\u2019s Manor had been secured fraudulently. Dick\u2019s representatives say they are not aware of any investigations. A spokeswoman for HSBC Jersey said: \u201cWe can\u2019t comment due to client confidentiality.\u201d</p> <p>A team of financial experts hired by Dick-Stock are examining whether other trusts linked to PanTrust \u2013 and two related trust companies \u2013 have also been plundered. There are claims that hundreds of millions of pounds may have been looted without the trust beneficiaries being aware of what had happened.</p> <h2>Question marks over the whistleblowers<br><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f20cb1552381b17c19e53aae9bd8dec9e2208880\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f20cb1552381b17c19e53aae9bd8dec9e2208880/0_167_580_348/500.jpg\" alt=\"John W.

Dick with his wife Mickey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jersey Evening Post</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is for this reason that Dick-Stock and her husband present themselves as whistleblowers. They have approached the Jersey Financial Services Commission (JFSC) and the island\u2019s financial crime unit, the JFCU, seeking their help in securing an investigation into the HSBC loan and their wider allegations of fraud, misappropriation and corruption. They claim to have handed over to the island\u2019s authorities and its police force thousands of pages of documents relating to hundreds of offshore trusts, which would make explosive reading, should they ever become public.</p> <p>But some are sceptical about their allegations and the sceptics have evidence to back their claims. Multiple lawsuits have been brought against the couple, including for unpaid debts. They have also fallen out with their original lawyers and other members of the extended Dick family.</p> <p>Dick-Stock\u2019s credibility as a witness was also heavily criticised in related proceedings brought in the Royal Court of Jersey. The court said, among other things, the evidence she gave was \u201cat odds with what she has said on oath to other courts in other places and she has frequently changed her case and evidence\u201d. It concluded \u201cwe did not find Tanya\u2019s evidence reliable nor did we find reliable evidence called on her behalf.\u201d</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the JFSC confirmed that it was aware of the couple\u2019s allegations and referred to the judgment above which raises serious questions about Dick-Stock\u2019s credibility and that of her claim as a whole.</p> <p>The JFSC spokeswoman said: \u201cIt is important to note that our role, as the regulator, is not to investigate allegations of fraud, as fraud is a criminal offence.\u201d</p> <h2>Compendium: Miami, money laundering and a mafia link<br><br></h2> <p>It\u2019s not the first time Dick has found himself up against a family member in a lengthy court case.</p> <p>In the early 90s, while embroiled in divorce proceedings with his second wife, Elizabeth, he was reportedly held in a Jersey prison for 22 days until her alimony payments were resolved. However, in reality he ended up living under house arrest in his mansion for health reasons.</p> <p>The divorce, which was notable for the fact that it took seven years to conclude \u2013 two years more than the marriage lasted \u2013 shone light on a secretive Jersey-based trust called Compendium which, it transpired, was the trustee of a John Dick trust.</p> <p>Compendium, the US authorities discovered, had been used by a Miami-based lawyer, Lawrence Freeman, who was indicted for laundering money for the mafia and drug runners. At the time, the court heard suggestions that the Dick family fortune was worth an estimated $1.2bn, a figure Dick\u2019s representatives now describe as \u201cwildly inaccurate\u201d.</p> <h2>\u2018It\u2019s like launching nuclear bombs. No one will win\u2019<br><br></h2> <p>A copy of the divorce settlement also confirmed that the Dicks listed a Jersey-based company, Sandsend Financial Services, among the assets in which they had a shared financial interest. The company, which was dissolved in 1999, was accused of receiving millions of dollars plundered from US savings and loan firms in the 1980s. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board found that it had received $7m of funds from a looted savings association called Vision Banc \u201cfor no apparent reason\u201d.</p> <p>There is no suggestion, nor was there any suggestion at the time, that Dick knew Sandsend or Compendium were being used for illegal purposes. But now, almost 30 years after his high-profile divorce garnered headlines, Dick once again finds himself in the spotlight.</p> <p>Ultimately the family feud, a modern-day Jarndyce v Jarndyce, may end in mutually assured destruction, just as it does in <em>Bleak House</em>, with only the lawyers celebrating.</p> <p>Dick\u2019s son, John Dick II, foresaw this possibility in a 2017 email he sent himself as a memo. While praising his sister for her \u201cmiraculous efforts\u201d in trying to unpick the Dick family\u2019s tortuous financial problems, he warned \u201cboth parties have the fiscal and mental fortitude to wage a war against each other but it would be the equivalent of launching nuclear bombs in which case neither party would win. The fallout would destroy what\u2019s left of the assets as well as greatly impact the lives of everyone around them\u201d.</p> <p>Not to mention Jersey\u2019s gilt-edged reputation for protecting the financial interests of the rich and powerful.</p> <p>Too bad.</p>",
  "<p>In the wake of the World Health Organization declaring the novel coronavirus 2019 a pandemic on Wednesday, major sports leagues in the United States and across the globe have reacted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-and-sport-a-list-of-the-major-cancellations\">canceling or postponing events</a>.

Yet despite the slew of professional organizations taking action to protect public health and safety, the Ultimate Fighting Championship, the leading promotion in mixed martial arts, has no intention of deviating from its upcoming schedule and has instead decided to move some of its shows to Las Vegas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/14/ufc-fight-night-brasilia-coronavirus\">UFC holds fight card in Brasilia amid coronavirus pandemic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the coronavirus \u2013 officially known as Covid-19 \u2013 spreads across the United States, a growing number of states have declared a state of emergency due to the outbreak, which allows states the authority to establish curfews, shut down public spaces, and a host of other restrictions. Among those states are Oregon, Ohio and New York, where the UFC was scheduled to hold events over the next few weeks. The organization has since <a href=\"https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2020/3/12/21177822/ufc-coronavirus-response-london-card-not-cancelled-las-vegas-apex-mma-news\">announced</a> that those shows (28 March in Columbus and 11 April in Portland) have been moved to the UFC\u2019s Apex facility in Las Vegas, a state-of-the-art arena space that sits adjacent to the UFC\u2019s headquarters, and will go ahead without fans.</p> <p>The UFC also revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/14/ufc-fight-night-brasilia-coronavirus\">Saturday\u2019s show in Brasilia</a>, where Charles Oliveira submitted Kevin Lee by guillotine choke in the main event, would be limited to staff and personnel after the city\u2019s governor declared a ban on large gatherings. However, it appears that the Brazilian MMA Athletic Commission \u2013 the regulatory body responsible for fighter safety \u2013 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guicruzzz/status/1238201943916494852?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1238201943916494852&amp;ref_url=https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2020/3/13/21177823/commission-watch-coronavirus-concerns-need-to-be-addressed-in-brazil-ufc-mma\">was not intending on testing fighters for COVID-19</a>, a troubling development given the contagious and unpredictable nature of the virus.</p> <p>Covid-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Sars-CoV-2), which is a virus related to Sars. The infection spreads via respiratory droplets from airways like coughing or sneezing, while the onset of symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath and headache is between two and 14 days. However, given that the incubation period ranges from one to 14 days (averaging five to six days), it is possible for asymptomatic individuals to spread the virus, which makes it highly contagious and difficult to control.</p> <p>As of Saturday, there were more than 150,000 confirmed cases resulting in about 5,800 deaths.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c6140f45877b55953ff37e5a1599b5a2a13f820\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c6140f45877b55953ff37e5a1599b5a2a13f820/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"UFC\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The UFC staged a full card on Saturday at the Nilson Nelson Gymnasium in Brazil\u2019s capital city.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Buda Mendes/Zuffa LLC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Due to the infectious nature of the virus, global health organizations including the WHO have published preventative measures to reduce the chance of spreading the infection in locations with outbreaks. These include practicing respiratory hygiene, social distancing and staying away from large-scale public gatherings. While sports organizations have interpreted this as an ethical obligation to suspend their seasons and cancel events, the UFC has no intention of canceling any upcoming shows.</p> <p>\u201cI talked to the president and the vice president about this, and they\u2019re taking this very serious,\u201d UFC president Dana White said during an appearance on ESPN\u2019s SportsCenter on Thursday. \u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018Be cautious, be careful, but live your life and stop panicking.\u2019 Everybody is panicking, and instead of panicking, we\u2019re actually getting out there and working with doctors and health officials and the government to figure out how to keep the sport safe and continue to put on events.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDXlSPu7Vy8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YDXlSPu7Vy8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>White added that the UFC plans to screen incoming fans with \u201cinfrared technology\u201d that would detect spikes in body temperatures such as those caused by fever. However, this policy is remarkably shortsighted given that Covid-19 can be spread by asymptomatic individuals, which means that those infected do not even have to show symptoms or feel unwell to be contagious to those around them. The UFC president also cited Trump\u2019s response to the pandemic, which has been <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/us-politics/article-president-trump-criticized-over-incompetent-response-to-coronavirus/\">heavily criticized</a> for the lack of available testing compared to other industrialized countries around the world. Given the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/aug/16/ufc-dana-white-donald-trump-relationship\">longstanding friendship between Trump and White</a>, it comes as little surprise that the UFC brass is basing its reaction entirely on the president\u2019s blundered response to the outbreak.</p> <p>It should be noted that several other MMA promotions have already taken steps to cancel upcoming shows. Euro-African promotion ARES FC postponed an upcoming event in Belgium. ONE Championship followed suit and postponed its 20 March show in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam after hosting its previous event in Singapore behind closed doors. Combate Americas announced a \u201cproactive plan\u201d that included postponing upcoming shows and scheduling new ones on a closed-set TV studio, while Bellator <a href=\"https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2020/03/bellator-241-coronavirus-prompts-postponement\">postponed</a> its Friday show hours before the event was set to begin.</p> <p>Interestingly, White and the UFC have failed to address the status of UFC 249: Khabib v Ferguson, which is still scheduled to take place on April 18th at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. New York State governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency in New York state last Saturday and has since <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/12/new-york-gov-cuomo-bans-gatherings-of-500-or-more-amid-coronavirus-outbreak.html\">placed a ban on gatherings of more than 500 people</a>. New York mayor Bill de Blasio declared a state of emergency in the city on Thursday and revealed that locations such as the Barclays Center and Madison Square Garden could be closed for months to deal with what \u201c<a href=\"https://www.netsdaily.com/2020/3/12/21177470/mayor-deblasio-barclays-center-madison-square-garden-could-be-closed-for-months\">could easily be a six-month crisis</a>.\u201d While the UFC will likely move its anticipated pay-per-piew event from Brooklyn to the Apex facility, it remains to be seen whether that will serve as a long-term solution for the promotion, especially given that Nevada has also declared a state of emergency.</p> <p>White\u2019s reaction to the outbreak over this past week, which includes the claim that he doesn\u2019t \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronbronsteter/status/1236553733405736962\">give a shit about the coronavirus</a>\u201d, suggests that the UFC will continue to push ahead with their planned events irrespective of concerns regarding public safety. During a time of crisis, the UFC\u2019s stubborn insistence that <em>the show must go on</em> is not only a prime example of corporate greed but a betrayal of its responsibility towards its staff, its fighters and the public at large.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not just a public health crisis, it is a crisis that will touch every sector,\u201d <a href=\"https://time.com/5791661/who-coronavirus-pandemic-declaration/\">said</a> Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, at a media briefing declaring Covid-19 a pandemic. \u201cSo every sector and every individual must be involved in the fights.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The selfish gene. The Big Bang. The greenhouse effect. Metaphors are at the heart of scientific thinking. They provide the means for both scientists and non-scientists to understand, think through and talk about abstract ideas in terms of more familiar objects or phenomena.</p> <p>But if metaphors can illuminate, they can also constrain. In his new book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-idea-of-the-brain-9781781255896.html\" title=\"\"><em>The </em><em>Idea of the Brain</em></a>, zoologist and historian Matthew Cobb tells the story of how scientists and philosophers have tried to understand the brain and how it works. In every age, Cobb shows, people have thought about the brain largely in terms of metaphors, drawn usually from the most exciting technology of the day, whether clocks or telephone exchanges or the contemporary obsession with computers. The brain, Cobb observes, \u201cis more like a computer than like a clock\u201d, but \u201ceven the simplest animal brain is not a computer like anything we have built, nor one we can yet envisage\u201d.</p> <p>Metaphors allow \u201cinsight and discovery\u201d but are \u201cinevitably partial\u201d and \u201cthere will come a point when the understanding they allow will be outweighed by the limits they impose\u201d. We may, Cobb suggests, be at that point in picturing the brain as a computer.</p> <p>The paradox of neuroscience today is that we possess an unprecedented amount of data about the brain but barely a glimmer of a theory to explain how it works. Indeed, as the French neuroscientist Yves Fr\u00e9gnac has put it, making ample use of metaphor, it can feel as if \u201cwe are drowning in a flood of information\u201d and that \u201call sense of global understanding [of brain function] is in acute danger of being washed away\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just in science that metaphors are significant in shaping the ways in which we think. In 1980, the linguist George Lakoff and philosopher Mark Johnson set off the modern debate on this issue with their seminal work, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Metaphors-We-Live-George-Lakoff/dp/0226468372/ref=dp_ob_title_bk\" title=\"\"><em>Metaphors We Live By</em></a>. Metaphors, they argued, are not linguistic flourishes but the fundamental building blocks of thought. We don\u2019t simply talk or write with metaphors, we also think with them.</p> <p>It\u2019s a view fiercely contested by other psychologists and linguists. But even critics don\u2019t deny the significance of metaphors. There is an episode of <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> in which the Starship Enterprise encounters an alien race called the Tamarians who speak only in <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/06/star-trek-tng-and-the-limits-of-language-shaka-when-the-walls-fell/372107/\" title=\"\">metaphors and allegories</a>. The Earthlings find it very difficult to communicate. Humans are not Tamarians. Nevertheless, there are few areas of life in which metaphoric use is not deeply embedded. Some studies suggest that one word in every 25 we use is a metaphor. And there is much evidence that the choice of metaphor can shape the way we perceive the world and act upon it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Social and political discusses are steeped in metaphors from 'trickle-down economics' to the 'red wall'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In a series of experiments, two psychologists, Paul Thibodeau and Lera Boroditsky, gave participants one of two reports about crime in the <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016782\" title=\"\">fictional city of Addison</a>. The reports were identical, except that in one crime was described as a \u201cwild beast preying on the city\u201d and in the other as a \u201cvirus infecting the city\u201d. When asked for solutions, those who read the first report suggested mostly tougher law enforcement and punishments, while those presented with the second were more willing to propose social reforms such as economic or healthcare improvements. Participants who identified as Republicans were 8-9% more likely to favour harsher punishment than Democrats. But the metaphor used made a difference twice as large \u2013 18-22%. Metaphors, Thibodeau and Boroditsky observe, \u201chave profound influences on how we conceptualise and act with respect to important societal issues\u201d.</p> <p>Social and political discussions are steeped in metaphors from \u201ctrickle-down economics\u201d to the \u201cred wall\u201d. They help frame the issues, and hence our responses, too. When politicians compare the national economy to a household budget, they are pushing us to think in particular ways about national debt or policies of austerity. Similarly, when politicians talk of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/30/david-cameron-migrant-swarm-language-condemned\" title=\"\">\u201cswarms\u201d of migrants </a>or describe countries as \u201cshields\u201d against them, the language aims to elicit particular public responses. The coronavirus is both a physical threat and a metaphor for everything from the failures of globalisation to the menace of foreigners.</p> <p>The role that metaphors play in science and politics is subtly different. Many scientists accept that metaphors can be limiting, but insist, too, that they are an essential tool for thinking. In political and social debates, metaphors are primarily ways of framing issues, and of shaping the ways in which people think about them.</p> <p>Metaphors can expand our vision and provide insights denied to more literal thinking. But, whether in science or in politics, we need to pay greater attention to the metaphors we wield.</p> <p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",

Those with persistent coughs or fevers should, from that point on, stay at home for seven days. The elderly would soon be told not to venture out, and families soon be quarantined if one member had a cough.</p> \n<p>But if the message was clear, it is not obvious that it was shared and agreed by others. When asked whether mass gatherings should be outlawed, the two experts were adamant that this was not necessary, in the short term at least. Banning large crowds would not have a \u201cbig effect\u201d on slowing transmission of Covid-19, said Vallance. Indeed, people were more likely to spread the virus watching football in a pub than at an open-air match, however big the crowd.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3589c53962af85c985e4f0be7f18dd678599758a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3589c53962af85c985e4f0be7f18dd678599758a/624_301_2642_1585/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rory Stewart.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rory Stewart.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Chown/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But within a few hours, these calm assurances began to look shaky.

The Wales v Scotland Six Nations Rugby match was also delayed. The government had little option but to follow, and Whitehall sources began briefing that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/uk-to-ban-mass-gatherings-in-coronavirus-u-turn\" title=\"\">mass gatherings would, after all, be banned from next week</a>.</p> \n<p>This change of heart was also spurred by some robust interventions from a number of politicians and commentators. Former Tory minister Rory Stewart, who is now hoping to become mayor of London, called for schools to be closed. \u201cEvidence from other pandemics is that closing schools and large gatherings earlier rather than later stops the peaks of this kind of disease,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of the <em>Lancet</em>, said the government was \u201cplaying roulette with the public\u201d, while Jeremy Hunt, a former health secretary, said the decision to hold off cancelling large gatherings was \u201csurprising and concerning\u201d.</p> \n<p>Look at Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, said the critics. There, Chinese authorities blocked all outdoor activities and halted the escalation, they argued. And, as the week wore on, and the number of deaths and sufferers across the world grew, more and more senior figures slowly began to question a British approach to coronavirus that began to look out of kilter with the responses of other countries including China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore.</p> \n<p>These criticisms were not just confined to politicians. \u201cSocial distancing has worked in China, Singapore and other countries,\u201d said Alan McNally, professor of microbial evolutionary genomics at Birmingham University. \u201cThere needs to be a combination of social distancing and extensive testing, followed by the quarantining of infected individuals to contain the epidemic \u2013 and that quarantine should not be at home, where we will see large levels of familial transmission, but in dedicated quarantine facilities.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Significant disruptions need high population compliance.

They continue to dismiss the idea that Britain should proceed immediately with major shutdowns, maintaining support for carefully controlled interventions. However, in doing so, they expose an alarming schism in the nation\u2019s attitudes to Covid-19 and the attempts to control it.</p> \n<p>A clear warning is provided by global health expert Dr Michael Head, of Southampton University. \u201cThe UK population have significant control over their daily life,\u201d he said yesterday. \u201cYou choose when to pop out for a pint of milk or go to a concert. Significant disruptions greatly reduce that control and thus need high population compliance.

In addition, countries such as Hong Kong and Singapore, which for so long have managed to contain Covid-19, now seem to be seeing a rise in transmissions, as infections continue to be introduced.\u201d</p> \n<p>Professor Mark Woolhouse of Edinburgh University agreed. \u201cIt is now very difficult for those countries that have gone into total lockdown to know under what circumstances they can come out of it. And, to the best of my knowledge, none of those countries has a clear plan \u2013 an exit strategy \u2013 through which they can relax their measures.\u201d</p> \n<p>Woolhouse added that the World Health Organization \u2013 which has been pushing for strict lockdown measures across the globe \u2013 had provided no advice on how these measures could be ended. The lesson for the UK is clear, say experts.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, pressure is building on the government to act more forcefully. Yesterday, Labour\u2019s health spokesman, Jonathan Ashworth, told the <em>Observer</em> that public confidence in the government\u2019s handling of the crisis was fragile and questions were increasingly being posed about key aspects of its strategy.</p> \n<p>\u201cDelaying the spread of this virus has to be a priority so as not to overwhelm our already overstretched NHS. But people are increasingly questioning if the UK is following international best practice. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/archive-2-zip/giv-39025RScOtAt04QY/\" data-alt=\".\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/archive-2-zip/giv-39025RScOtAt04QY/\">.</a> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWhy are we no longer testing those with symptoms who are advised to stay at home, when the World Health Organization recommends continued testing, for example?

We need total clarity to maintain public confidence.\u201d</p> \n<p>In general, Johnson has steered clear of politicising the coronavirus scandal, although the tension between playing politics and managing a national emergency was evident in last week\u2019s budget. For the first 10 to 15 minutes, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, struck a sombre note as he announced that every financial resource possible would be directed to minimise the coronavirus crisis. After that, however, Sunak turned the event into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/12/rishi-sunak-budget-fiscal-policy-economy-power\" title=\"\">pantomime of crowd-pleasing gestures</a> for Tory MPs, which robbed it of the seriousness it merited.</p> \n<p>Last week, opposition parties \u2013including Labour, the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems \u2013 began questioning the government\u2019s approach and raised \u201cgenuine concerns\u201d that the UK was not doing as much as other EU countries. And yesterday, a senior Labour source said that there was a gathering sense of unease among MPs that more needed to be done. \u201cThe political consensus is not going to hold for much longer at this rate,\u201d said the source.</p> \n<p>The loss of that consensus could have dramatic and long-lasting consequences. This point was summed up by medical researcher Michael Head of Southampton University. \u201cMore stringent interventions will come, and potentially very soon,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that. Many people are vocal, saying gung-ho should be the UK response. The usual justification that comes with that is, \u2018because they\u2019re doing it over there\u2019. That\u2019s not providing the evidence base that supports those views.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Evening is falling and the cold winter light is bleeding out of a steel-coloured sky. Soon the short Scandinavian afternoon will give way to night here on the edge of Lake Sonnanen in the south of Finland. Not a single gust of wind moves the pine branches; not a single ripple disturbs the water\u2019s surface. Nothing disturbs this infinite expanse of trees, ice and snow enveloped by absolute silence.</p> <p>It\u2019s here, in a simple hunter\u2019s lodge 170km northeast of Helsinki, that freediver Johanna Nordblad and her sister and personal photographer, Elina, spend most of their free time. With urban rhythms left far behind, their days are occupied by shovelling snow, gathering firewood and spending long hours after dinner chatting by candlelight.</p> <p>\u201cElina and I always come up here whenever we can. I love this natural setting, these lakes,\u201d explains Nordblad. \u201cPeople don\u2019t like to practise freediving in Finland because the water is black in the depths, but that\u2019s exactly why I like it so much. Down below there are no colours, no sounds. There\u2019s nothing\u2026 You are completely alone with yourself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"987468e545d0ebf5c54249987b2270b8e80eeaff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/987468e545d0ebf5c54249987b2270b8e80eeaff/0_236_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I love this natural setting, these lakes\u2019: Nordblad getting ready to dive under the ice.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I love this natural setting, these lakes\u2019: Nordblad getting ready to dive under the ice.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elina Manninen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nordblad, 44, from Finland, first freedived in 1999 after years as a scuba diver. The feeling of lightness proved liberating, and being able to swim without the weight of equipment won her over instantly. She began competing at world championship level \u2013 taking part in events where divers perform in different disciplines to see who can dive the deepest, or stay underwater the longest, with no breathing apparatus. There are 11 types of freediving \u2013 for example, diving for depth or swimming horizontally, with or without weights, with or without fins, in open water or swimming pools. Nordblad specialises in dynamic freediving with fins, which involves swimming as far as possible horizontally underwater on one breath.</p> <p>In 2004, in Cyprus, she set the women\u2019s world record by swimming a horizontal distance of 158m, and since then she has ranked among the best freedivers in the world.</p> <p>\u201cThe most difficult thing is watching the seconds go by. After two or three minutes your mind starts listing all the reasons why you should go back up to the surface instead of staying underwater. The more time goes by, the harder it gets. You need a lot of self-control,\u201d she says.</p> <p>But then, in 2010, a serious accident changed her life and set her on the path to make her mark in a new discipline, one in which she still holds the current world record: freediving under ice.</p> <p>\u201cI was riding a downhill bike, travelling a slippery, muddy path down a hill when suddenly I began to slip,\u201d she recounts. \u201cThe fall wasn\u2019t particularly dangerous, but I was unlucky and I hit a rock. My left leg was smashed into a thousand pieces, like a twisted branch.\u201d Rushed to hospital, Nordblad underwent delicate surgery. The swelling and compound fractures were so serious that the doctors weren\u2019t able to sew the leg back up and close the wounds until another 10 days had passed.</p> <p>A graphic designer by trade, she decided to sell her agency in Helsinki and say goodbye to the 13 people who were working for her to concentrate on rehabilitation, a painful and complex process that lasted for more than 18 months, consuming all her energies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a198b6c4177bec0a0b18358921b2b7c36f63ada3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a198b6c4177bec0a0b18358921b2b7c36f63ada3/0_374_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018My leg smashed into a thousand pieces\u2019: Nordblad on the bicycle accident that sparked her diving career.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My leg smashed into a thousand pieces\u2019: Nordblad on the bicycle accident that sparked her diving career.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elina Manninen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After another year had passed she was finally able to walk without a stick, but the nerves in her leg were so badly damaged that the pain was profound and persistent. \u201cThat\u2019s when my doctor recommended I try cold-water therapy,\u201d says Nordblad. \u201cThe first time I put my leg in 4C water I only managed to keep it in for a minute, but the relief was immediate. Finally, it didn\u2019t hurt any more.\u201d</p> <p>As the months passed, Nordblad became so accustomed to the cold that she found she could no longer do without it. She began immersing the other leg as well, then her entire body, ultimately even her head. \u201cI liked the way it felt. That\u2019s when I first got the idea of diving beneath the ice. What better place to try it than Finland?\u201d</p> <p>In what is known as apnea \u2013 conducted beneath the ice \u2013 the diver has to move horizontally, covering a preset distance between two holes cut into the ice. In 2015, Nordblad set the women\u2019s world record in this discipline \u2013 50m \u2013 wearing only a simple swimsuit and goggles. The water temperature was barely 2C. \u201cUp until the end I was afraid that my head, the part of the body that suffers the most during low-temperature dives, couldn\u2019t take it,\u201d she confesses. \u201cBut in reality things were easier than I\u2019d anticipated.\u201d</p> <p>While her sister is preparing dinner, Nordblad sits on the little wooden dock that runs out from the bank into the lake, busy breaking up the thin layer of ice that\u2019s formed on the water\u2019s surface over the past couple of days. After she\u2019s pushed a few sections underwater, she lights a series of candles that illuminate the wooden stairs leading down into the water. Soon she\u2019ll be able to take the first dive of the season. She\u2019s been waiting for this moment for weeks, and it stirs emotions she finds hard to conceal.</p> <p>\u201cI love diving, feeling the water run between your fingers\u2026 When you\u2019re down below there\u2019s no margin for error. You have only yourself to trust. You have to be relaxed and in control at the same time,\u201d she explains. \u201cFreediving requires physical effort, but mental discipline is even more important. You have to do the dive without panicking or losing your head.\u201d</p> <p>Swimming beneath ice has other pitfalls. Visibility is one, since the thick layer of ice and snow on the water\u2019s surface often reduces vision to a minimum. It\u2019s easy to become disoriented and not be able to even see the exit hole, so much so that safety ropes are extended between the holes. \u201cSometimes I can\u2019t even make out my own hands. That\u2019s how dark the water can be. In the event of a real emergency, my safety plan is to swim down deeper below the surface. That\u2019s the only way I can look up and see light coming in from the two holes and figure out where I can get out.\u201d</p> <p>Although it\u2019s hard to believe, Nordblad is afraid of the depths. Every time she goes freediving and swims down to the Finnish lakebed, her mind turns to sea monsters and unknown creatures that populate the abyss. \u201cThe deepest point I reach corresponds to the extreme limits of my ability to dominate my fears. Otherwise I could go much deeper,\u201d she says with a smile.</p> <p>Although she still holds the record for diving beneath the ice, for Nordblad freediving has long since evolved into something more than a desire to beat her opponents. \u201cIf you compete with that mentality, you\u2019re not enjoying the moment. I don\u2019t deny I thought that way when I was younger, but now I don\u2019t like it any more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6ca4641272a3144b385c2b285c164507a814812\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6ca4641272a3144b385c2b285c164507a814812/0_213_5616_3509/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018So many windows of opportunity open up around you\u2019: Nordblad on winning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018So many windows of opportunity open up around you\u2019: Nordblad on winning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elina Manninen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen you win, the expectations of those around you increase automatically,\u201d she says. \u201cSo many different windows of opportunity open up around you that you have to be good at figuring out what you want from life and what you truly desire from this sport.\u201d</p> <p>In 2006, Nordblad earned one of just three government grants reserved for non-Olympic Finnish athletes. Not by chance, that was the year she found herself training the least. \u201cGoing to the pool just wasn\u2019t fun any more. I was losing motivation. I love apnea because I find it more stimulating than spending hours looking at a computer screen, but I realised I was turning it into a job just like any other,\u201d she explains. \u201cOne of the most beautiful periods of my life was the time just after my rehabilitation. I spent two years out in the open: I would take my kayak and go out and explore the islands around Helsinki. There are hundreds of them, and all you need is to paddle for five minutes before you\u2019re completely lost in nature.\u201d</p> <p>At the end of the month Nordblad will attempt to beat the men\u2019s ice freediving world record (currently standing at 76.2m and held by Stig Severinsen, a Danish four-time world freediving champion). She is aiming to swim horizontally beneath the ice for 81m. She will take the challenge in her stride, almost as if it were a game. Sometimes that\u2019s how remarkable achievements are accomplished.</p>",

Scranton, a town of 77,000 nestled in the rolling hills of north-eastern Pennsylvania\u2019s Wyoming Valley, is firmly a part of America\u2019s rust belt \u2013 a band of towns and cities stretching nearly a thousand miles from Wisconsin in the west all the way through Pennsylvania in the east.</p> <p>The communities in the rust belt suffered more than most from de-industrialization, as coalmines, steel plants and car factories closed, and some areas still suffer from chronic unemployment. Scranton was once home to the coal industry, and the city and region boomed in the 1930s and 40s, but the decline was just as swift. As the US turned to oil and gas for its energy, mines closed and jobs were lost.</p> <p>Biden and his family moved to Delaware in 1953 after his father struggled to find work in Pennsylvania.

He<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/pennsylvania\"> won Pennsylvania</a> by 48.2% to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 47.5%, and he narrowly triumphed in Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio, too.</p> <p>In 2020, that means Biden\u2019s background is a key part of his case to be the Democratic nominee. If he is chosen, it could prove crucial in recapturing those states and the White House. Biden\u2019s case for being the nominee is based, in part, around his ability to win in the midwest, and he will point to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/10/us/elections/results-michigan-president-democrat-primary-election.html\">his convincing win in Michigan</a> on Tuesday as supporting evidence.</p> <p>That success in the rust belt was a long time in the making, and came after a concerted effort to make people aware of his upbringing: in the space of two weeks at the end of 2019 Biden was still pumping out shamelessly Scranton-specific advertisements, including \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Pr_NcJK5Tw\">Scranton Values</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S98mI1tTkVM\">A Kid from Scranton</a>\u201d.</p> <p>In those ads, as in person, Biden looks good for his 77 years.

  "<p>As coronavirus grew from a Chinese outbreak to a global pandemic, the aviation industry was at the leading edge of the accompanying financial crisis. Since the extraordinary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-outbreak-us-trump-latest\" title=\"\">intercontinental travel ban</a> imposed by President Trump last week, the disastrous potential extent of the crisis for airlines has become clear.</p> <p>A drop-off in demand, as businesses cut back on travel and passengers deferred holidays, is being replaced by government decrees and mandatory public health measures. If much lost trade has so far come in the quiet months for western carriers in the northern hemisphere, the prospect of losing spring and summer bookings is another scale of financial loss altogether.</p> <p>Already, major airlines \u2013 even the likes of British Airways and German carrier Lufthansa, let alone the financially precarious Norwegian \u2013 have made it clear that this is now a challenge to their very survival. The speedy escalation of the crisis, with major hubs such as Madrid now following Rome in being declared off-limits to non-essential travel, makes it impossible to predict whether this is a hiatus \u2013 or if measures announced as temporary could last for much longer.</p> <p>As British Airways\u2019 boss, Alex Cruz, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/13/ba-says-jobs-will-go-as-airline-industry-faces-crisis-worse-than-9-11-coronavirus\" title=\"\">told 45,000 staff on Friday</a>, for airlines this is already bigger than the Sars epidemic, the aftermath of 9/11 or the 2008 financial crisis. In extraordinary times, the normal rules will no longer apply. Flag carriers have swiftly appealed for state aid. Layoffs could be temporary, or permanent. Already a glut of planes are mothballed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Airline seats are perishable goods, and most of the revenues will never be recouped</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The withdrawal of most scheduled international air travel, even for a short time, no longer looks improbable as much of Europe approaches the kind of shutdown so far seen only in Italy. Indeed, the idea of shuttling vast numbers of people anywhere, let alone between infected countries, has rapidly started to look reckless.</p> <p>Yet it is worth noting that public transport continues to function in Italy; people still need services, food and goods. And a plane flying in Chinese medics and supplies was warmly welcomed to Rome on Friday. That flight was another reminder of how aviation remains an essential part of our world; why governments have long subsidised flag carriers, at vast expense.</p> <p>Last week\u2019s emergency measures included the cancellation of international sporting fixtures \u2013 taking away another small but significant slice of life that is dependent on air travel. But before the latest escalation, planes had been flying almost empty, with many of the dwindling numbers of passengers deciding not to show up \u2013 something that made clear how many airline trips are entirely discretionary.</p> <p>Perhaps, if and when normality returns, there could be a glut of pent-up demand from societies forced to work from home or self-isolate. But airline seats are perishable goods, and most of the revenues will never be recouped; many of those who might have booked holidays can expect to see annual leave used up to care for children sent home from school, or sick relatives. Business travel that has been postponed for health fears may end up looking like an unaffordable expense for many firms, should coronavirus lead to recession.</p> <p>A sustained pandemic could vastly alter the industry. Far smaller shocks have caused weak airlines to go under; but even the big players are likely to have their wings clipped. The appetite for travel may be an ancient human urge, but global hypermobility is only a couple of decades old. Action on climate change may have restricted aviation; higher fares from reduced competition might yet do more. Now, societies forced to do without flying may also start to question whether the habit was worth it.</p> <p>Even before coronavirus, protectionism in trade and the political willingness to erect fresh borders with neighbours had re-emerged to a startling extent. A world haunted by viruses arguably needs globalised structures more than ever, but is meanwhile ever more ready to slam international doors. Airlines, so often the canary in the coalmine for the global economy, may never fly quite so high again.</p> <h2>Saudi ruthlessness on display once more<br></h2> <p>It was not so long ago that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman hoped to convince the global financial community that Saudi Arabia was a respectable modern economy, home to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2019/nov/18/saudi-aramco-flotation-is-a-failure-before-it-has-even-begun\" title=\"\">Saudi Aramco</a> \u2013 the world\u2019s most profitable listed company \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/30/russia-saudi-arabia-extend-deal-opec-oil-output\" title=\"\">a power broker</a> in stabilising oil markets.</p> <p>But if Prince Mohammed had expected to establish a reputation as a moderniser and visionary, then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/saudi-arabia-oil-price-war-production-increase-aramco\" title=\"\">waging an oil price war</a> during a deadly pandemic might not have been his most considered move.</p> <p>The world\u2019s largest oil exporter triggered the worst day in the financial markets since 1987 last week after firing the starting gun on a race to pump more oil than the global market can absorb. The benchmark price fell by its fastest rate since the 1991 Gulf war to lows not seen in four years, wiping billions from the market value of companies across the energy sector.</p> <p>These companies form the pillars of global equity markets, which buckled under the pressure of plummeting share prices and fears that the economic contagion of the Covid-19 virus might trigger a worldwide recession.</p> <p>The decision of the Saudi crown prince to wreak havoc on the global markets is both shocking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/10/saudi-rul-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-struck-first-crackdown\" title=\"\">and true to form</a>.</p> <p>Prince Mohammed is never far from accusations of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/21/revealed-the-saudi-heir-and-the-alleged-plot-to-undermine-jeff-bezos\" title=\"\">extortion</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/04/saudi-arabia-mass-arrests-of-dissidents-and-torture-allegations-continue\" title=\"\">torture</a> and even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/19/the-guardian-view-on-jamal-khashoggis-murder-saudi-arabia-and-its-friends\" title=\"\">murder</a>, all denied. If the oil market is a game of money and power, he is playing for the latter. By flooding the world with cheap Saudi oil, the kingdom will corner the global market and reassert its dominance against the rise of Russia and American shale production. It is a race Russia is willing to run, but there is no doubt that this is a race to the bottom.</p> <p>At least there is one constant in the markets: the ruthless impetuousness of the Saudi regime.</p> <h2>Intu must auction off the crown jewels<br></h2> <p>Shopping centre owner Intu is unlikely to last until the end of the year in its current form, despite boasting nine of the UK\u2019s top 20 malls, including Manchester\u2019s Trafford Centre and Lakeside in Essex.</p> <p>A \u00a32bn loss, postponement of an emergency cash call, questions about its status as a going concern, and a share price down more than 90% over the past year \u2013 the group\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/08/intu-unknown-retail-landlord-fundamental-threat\" title=\"\">debt problems are mounting</a>.

Most analysts believe Intu won\u2019t reach that date without drastic action.</p> <p>The company\u2019s management is putting on a brave face, insisting they have options. But the time for selling mid-tier assets and tinkering around the edges is over. Survival means facing up to the unpalatable \u2013 auctioning off the crown jewels, such as the Trafford Centre.</p> <p>The company holds the debt for each centre in separate vehicles, rather than at group level, making any move to take Intu private costly and complex, even for an investor such as billionaire John Whittaker \u2013 the original owner of the Trafford Centre \u2013 who runs Peel Group, Intu\u2019s largest shareholder.</p> <p>The value of Intu\u2019s properties tumbled by 22% last year. Further falls of just 5% would see the loan-to-value ratios on some of its centres hit danger levels. If it triggers a covenant, as occurred in January with Gateshead\u2019s Metrocentre, the banks could ask for the keys back.</p> <p>And this is without adding coronavirus into the mix.

The catalyst to a certain degree was McLaren. That\u2019s what lit the fuse.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a big blow for Aussie sport, people have come from inter-state and internationally.

Somehow, it manages to improve the experience, rather than make you squeeze the edge of your seat until your knuckles are white. Early on chef C\u00fa\u00e1n Greene delivers a small, rough-hewn ceramic dish to the table. There\u2019s a pillow of dried lemon verbena leaves overlaid with greaseproof paper upon which perch four curving, layered pieces of pearly kohlrabi, interleaved with sorrel leaves. The kohlrabi, we are told, has been marinated in quince vinegar. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of chilled salad in finger-food form,\u201d Greene says, cheerfully. He\u2019s not wrong: it\u2019s crisp and boldly refreshing. It\u2019s also clever without being irritatingly, look-at-me distracting. Most importantly it tastes nice. Important, that.</p> <p>I was directed to Bastible, the name of a traditional Irish cooking pot, by Lisa Cope, who writes for the <em>Irish Times</em> and edits <a href=\"https://www.allthefood.ie/\" title=\"\">All the Food</a>, a website covering the joys of eating and drinking in the Irish capital. This is the first time I\u2019ve reviewed in Dublin and she gave me the impression that now is the time to get there. Ireland, she said, is currently seeing the upside of the exodus of talent that occurred around the recession a decade or so ago. Chefs like Greene are flocking back, their pockets stuffed with experience, their heads full of new ideas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35db6c1158ebe0789467ee47159238526b7e60ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35db6c1158ebe0789467ee47159238526b7e60ac/1391_403_3870_3559/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kohlrabi, sorrel, lemon verbena.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"920\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Salad as finger food\u2019: kohlrabi, sorrel, lemon verbena.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristan Hutchinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Greene\u2019s case, elsewhere was Noma in Copenhagen, where chef Ren\u00e9 Redzepi pursues a devoutly regionalist agenda: it\u2019s vinegar instead of lemon juice, butter rather than olive oil, because it\u2019s a northern European restaurant not a southern Mediterranean one. Some people, those who like ideology more than lunch, got the wrong end of the Norway spruce stick over all this. They saw Noma as somehow defining the correct agenda for all restaurants. In a globalised world, that\u2019s absurd. We can find such notions interesting in Dublin or Copenhagen, while still craving the flavours of Provence or Malaysia and being grateful they are available nearby.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4f415a48526084a779671241f9f6f682c46cb1cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f415a48526084a779671241f9f6f682c46cb1cd/278_1927_4147_3305/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grilled, compressed ox tongue.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"797\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pierced tongue: grilled, compressed ox tongue cured with juniper.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristan Hutchinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In truth, the agenda is utterly pointless unless, like Redzepi, you\u2019re also an exceptionally gifted chef. The same applies to Greene. The man is bursting with good taste and technique. Bastible was opened four years ago in Portobello to the south of Dublin\u2019s city centre by Barry Fitzgerald and Claire-Marie Thomas. Greene arrived last spring and is now throwing everything on to the table. Usually, the prospect of a tasting menu makes my left eye twitch, but here on a Sunday lunchtime it becomes a joyful dance. Those of us who arrive early \u2013 lunch trails on until darkness falls \u2013 get to watch those a few courses behind, jealously, knowing the joys they have to come.</p> <p>It starts, as ever, with an addictive, hard-crusted sourdough, with a crunch like crackling, and whorls of whipped, salty cultured butter that demand to be finished. That\u2019s followed by a cube of thinly sliced and then compressed ox tongue. It arrives pierced on the still-smoking twig on which it was grilled. It has been cured with juniper. It is seasoned with dried, powdered mushrooms and the seaside briskness of dried kelp. It has the soft meatiness of the very best pastrami.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23cbcd91343058701d8e4cfb0482dde66a333923\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23cbcd91343058701d8e4cfb0482dde66a333923/0_2658_4480_3091/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swede cooked in ginger, with pumpkin seeds and kelp.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"690\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swede sensation: cooked in ginger, with pumpkin seeds and kelp.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristan Hutchinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Next, there\u2019s a rough-chopped tartare of Dexter beef under the forest floor earthiness of an artichoke cream, thickly dusted with more dried, powdered ceps and layered with a few green leaves. It\u2019s a rugged dish in all ways. Against it, the kohlrabi acts as a palate cleanser and sets us up for the arrival of sweet and sticky Connemara prawns served raw, with thin slices of broccoli stem and leaves of marigold perched on top of each piece so that, arranged in a curve, they look like a Roman senator\u2019s garland. It sits in a pool of a deep green broth made with the juices from the kohlrabi, fig leaf oil and the punch of horseradish. These are the ingredients that are available now, shown as good a time as possible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ebbdf0272183397df9d1528ac66c5574a80c6054\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebbdf0272183397df9d1528ac66c5574a80c6054/119_325_4361_6359/686.jpg\" alt=\"Cooking to thrill: chef C\u00fa\u00e1n Greene.\" width=\"686\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cooking to thrill: chef C\u00fa\u00e1n Greene.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristan Hutchinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As is the next dish. It\u2019s a \u201ccelebration of the humble swede\u201d as Greene puts it. (There are waiters working the simple square box of a dining room, but he does serve some of the dishes himself straight from the open kitchen to the tables.) The semi-circular discs of swede have been cooked slowly in ginger oil to a gentle piquancy. Alongside, is what he calls a pumpkin seed mole, a deep savoury sauce glowing with jewel-like dots of more oil. Tiny square pieces of slightly jellied kelp form a pattern across the swede along with hyper savoury pumpkin seeds roasted in yeast. Gosh. And, oh.</p> <p>I ask Greene about the ginger, which seems to break the regional frame. He agrees it does, but says he\u2019s not doctrinaire. For the most part, though, lunch comes from hereabouts and right now. We are presented with a slab of cured sea trout to share. It\u2019s a deep, appealing shade of dirty orange. It\u2019s been brushed repeatedly with a quince glaze and is warm so that the oils are just running. We are told to treat it like smoked salmon; to pull it away from the skin below. There\u2019s a farl of bread made with new potatoes, its undulating surface rendered dark and sticky courtesy of a cider-vinegar glaze. To mitigate the sweetness of the fish, we have a boisterously sour gooseberry compote, plus a bowl of yogurt dusted with powdered dried herbs. How you put these together is up to you. It has become the best kind of buffet.</p> <p>To finish we have a sweetened and set sheep\u2019s milk yogurt with a sauce of fermented plum. Better still, is an intense milk chocolate mousse hiding a scoop of yeast ice-cream, sprinkled with dried plum skins and blackcurrant, in a sweet, nutty syrup made from beer. Oh, and would you like a chewy caramel wrapped in blackcurrant leather and dusted with salt? Yes please.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd7e28a703dcdc3abfd095c7bc2f26c8f982b93c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd7e28a703dcdc3abfd095c7bc2f26c8f982b93c/0_2817_4480_3148/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Milk chocolate mousse\" width=\"1000\" height=\"703\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Intense and complex: milk chocolate mousse hiding a yeast ice-cream, with dried plum skins, blackcurrant, and a nutty beer syrup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristan Hutchinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This has been my most detailed account of the food I was served in a long while, but Bastible warrants it.

It\u2019s certainly the title and subject of the award-winning tome by Mark Diacono. The cookbook, published last year, has brought an element of vitality to my kitchen, holding my hand through my first batches of kimchi and sourdough bread. Perceptions towards sourness in wine have changed enormously. Where once it would have been a term of abuse, it\u2019s now at least occasionally accepted as praise. It\u2019s a matter of moderation. I enjoy the wincing sensation of the sour in wine, provided it doesn\u2019t take over completely (I\u2019m not in the market for vinegar) and it\u2019s balanced by other elements, such as the crisp apple, grapefruit and salty minerals in Gorka Izagirre\u2019s otherwise bracing Basque dry white.</p> <p><strong>Simpsons Chalklands Classic Cuv\u00e9e, Kent, England 2016 (\u00a322.95, <a href=\"https://www.robersonwine.com/buy-wines/chalklands-classic-cuvee-2016-simpsons-wine-estate-75-00SICC16/\">Roberson Wine</a>) </strong>Gorka Izagirre\u2019s is a refined version of one of those styles that only makes sense in context. There are some very sour examples of Txacoli which are perfectly fine when drunk with seafood in the Basque country. Another place with a reputation for sour is the UK. In lesser vintages, when the growing season has been too cold and wet to ripen the grapes, English whites can feel like sucking an unripe gooseberry. Even the best English wines have a slight touch of the tinglingly acidic. But, again, that only becomes attractive when it\u2019s just one element of many, as it is in the increasingly excellent range of sparkling wines. In one of my current favourites that tangy twang provides an energising note in among the subtle baker\u2019s shop and ripe apple of Simpsons\u2019s Kentish fizz.</p> <p><strong>Burlotto Dolcetto d\u2019Alba, Italy 2018 (\u00a316.95, <a href=\"https://www.leaandsandeman.co.uk/wine/2018-DOLCETTO-D-ALBA-G-B-Burlotto-36319-00.html\">Lea &amp; Sandeman</a>) </strong>The absolute masters of sour in red wine are the Italians. There\u2019s an understanding that sourness can act as both a mouth-freshening agent and as a kind of base-layer around which all the other elements in the wine can circulate. So many Italian red wines have this element of the sour-tang, which may be reminiscent of the smarting of plum skins or the tartness of just-ripe cherries. The sour is a big part of the appeal in the Piedmont variety barbera, for example, both in a cheerfully rustic example, such as the Co-op Irresistible Barbera d\u2019Asti 2016 (\u00a37.50, <a href=\"https://www.coop.co.uk/\">the Co-op</a>), and as a background hum in Andrea Oberto\u2019s glorious Barbera d\u2019Alba 2017 (\u00a317.50, <a href=\"https://www.leaandsandeman.co.uk/wine/2017-BARBERA-D-ALBA-Andrea-Oberto-28076-00.html\">Lea &amp; Sandeman</a>), while the sweet-sourness of black cherries is part of the appeal in a gorgeous, supple and vibrantly juicy dolcetto from Burlotto.</p> <p><em>Follow David on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daveydaibach?lang=en\">@Daveydaibach</a></em></p>",

The tech giant <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179118/google-coronavirus-testing-screening-website-drive-thru-covid-19\">denied it is doing any such thing</a>.</p> <p>The bizarrely misleading claim was indicative of Trump\u2019s mishandling of a crisis different in magnitude from any he faced before.

Asked about the shortage, which left America lagging far behind South Korea and other countries, Trump said: \u201cI don\u2019t take responsibility at all.\u201d</p> <p>The past few weeks have also brought a cascade of false statements that sought to downplay the severity of the threat and wish it away. The coronavirus is not as bad as the seasonal flu, Trump has maintained, and will disappear in the warmth of spring. The slump of financial markets, on which Trump has yoked so much of his re-election hopes, finally seized his attention.</p> <p>Everything he did, however, just seemed to make matters worse. He toured the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta wearing a \u201cKeep America Great\u201d cap, boasting of his \u201cnatural ability\u201d to understand the subject and making the bogus assertion that any American who needs a coronavirus test can get one.</p> <p>On Wednesday this week he addressed the nation from the Oval Office, live on primetime TV. It was, in many viewers\u2019 estimation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/11/donald-trump-us-coronavirus-address\">an unmitigated disaster</a>, fueling anxiety rather than calm, panic rather than reassurance. Trump blindsided European officials by announcing a 30-day travel ban and made some basic factual errors the White House had to correct.</p> <p>Then came Friday\u2019s rose garden reset. Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/donald-trump-coronavirus-national-emergency\">declared a national emergency</a> that released $50bn for state and local governments. Shaking hands with chief executives despite medical advice on social distancing, the president promised a public-private partnership to finally make testing widely available.</p> <p>His eternally loyal vice-president, Mike Pence, did his best to reshape the narrative.</p> <p>\u201cThis day should be an inspiration to every American,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause thanks to your leadership from early on, not only are we bringing a whole-of-government approach to confronting the coronavirus, we\u2019re bringing an all-of-America approach.</p> <p>\u201cMr President, from early on, you took decisive action. You suspended all travel from China \u2026 throughout this process, Mr President, you\u2019ve put the health of America first.\u201d</p> <p>It was an attempt to right the ship and restore confidence. But will it work?</p> <p>There was a promising sign on the stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped nearly 2,000 points \u2013 its biggest point gain ever.</p> <p>Furthermore, there are few signs that the coronavirus shambles has disillusioned Trump\u2019s supporters.

I only knew about it the next morning. There was no time to react, no option to leave. I was panicked and at a loss. I didn\u2019t know when the lockdown would end, so went out to buy vegetables and see how the food supply was, which alleviated my anxiety to some extent.</p> <p>Every day, I have tried to get up and exercise, cook and eat, write a diary and do some volunteer work. Taking action and doing things makes you feel better.</p> <p>Everyone has been worrying and I have been restricting the time spent outside. I am isolated here. But human beings are social.

Like most people, I didn\u2019t know before that the epidemic was so serious. So when I went home, I was very worried I had been infected and afraid I would infect my family.</p> <p>I sprayed alcohol all over my body. I consciously kept a distance with my family. After half a month of self isolation, nothing happened. Finally, the stone hanging in my heart was lifted.</p> <p>Seeing the messages online of people begging for help and unable to find a hospital bed was really hard for me. I felt like I couldn\u2019t help. If I was in Wuhan maybe there would have been something I could have done. The more [messages] I saw, the guiltier I felt. As much as I could, I tried to forward on people\u2019s requests for help online. Reading the news and these posts, I felt despair and like my heart could not bear that much.</p> <p>I feel like I am a survivor. It\u2019s a privilege to be healthy. I have read books, watched plays and movies. I have watched the news. I started writing a \u201clock down\u201d diary, and plan to write until the end of the lockdown. I have written every day. Sometimes I just have just posted a picture. Several of my posts have been deleted but it has helped me. It has provided a channel for me to express emotions.

I am not special.</p> <h2><strong>Hu, 22 Huanggang city, Hubei: \u2018Talking with friends is really important\u2019</strong></h2> <p>I have documented what was happening through conversations with people or by going out. I have also volunteered in the hospitals. This has kept me busy, and allowed me to relax while also helping some of the rescue efforts. It has helped relieve some of the mental and emotional pressure.</p> <p>Talking with friends is also really important. On the night of 6 February [when the Chinese doctor and whistleblower Li Wenliang died], I spent all night reading the news on Weibo and WeChat. Like me, my friends didn\u2019t sleep. Every update someone saw, they would immediately share.</p> <p>This was the hardest time for me. There\u2019s no way to really deal with this except to remember it. Also, in late January when the outbreak first exploded \u2026 seeing all the messages online of people asking for help and the huge gap between what was being reported in the news and what was really happening also caused a lot of mental pressure.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Lillian Yang</em></p>",

I think his team will try to stay in that fairly narrow zone.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if they also spend a fair amount of time focused on Trump. Here\u2019s a way that he can use a sledgehammer on Trump but a scalpel on Sanders: by saying, \u2018Here\u2019s a guy we elected that had no experience, no people willing to work for him, no people he is willing to listen to. We can\u2019t have that anymore.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Galen and O\u2019Malley both deplored a tweet sent by Trump\u2019s campaign this week which called Biden a \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TeamTrump/status/1238485971571576832\">rotting corpse of a candidate</a>\u201d, and said it was a taste of the fierce and dirty fight to come.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is one question and only one question that viewers will be asking themselves during Sunday\u2019s debate,\u201d O\u2019Malley said, \u201cand it is this: which of these two candidates would do the best job of keeping me and my family safe in a big emergency, like, a pandemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat I do know is that of the three men left [including Trump], more and more people are wishing Biden were already in charge.\u201d</p> \n<p>In fact, the Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is still campaigning.

On Tuesday, with coronavirus doing what a virus does, meaning going viral, the on-air chat was of little else. And although everyone kept insisting that we should just follow governmental advice, the calls from listeners to <em>Your Call</em> revealed how confused people are. Should a listener with sciatica stop taking her immune-suppressant medication? (No, she should take it.) Should someone who\u2019s been to Basel in Switzerland and has a few mild symptoms go to work? (No, stay home and call 111, because then you will be logged somewhere on the NHS system, so that if you do get ill, you have a contact.) So said <a href=\"https://www.thethirdwayofevolution.com/people/view/frank-p.-ryan\" title=\"\">Dr Frank Ryan</a>, a virus specialist who didn\u2019t seem to agree with governmental advice about very much at all. The BBC has rushed out a coronavirus podcast <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/p085f9hw\" title=\"\">on Sounds</a>, by the way, which includes this show.</p> <p>On Wednesday morning, with the news that Nadine Dorries had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/health-minister-nadine-dorries-diagnosed-with-coronavirus\" title=\"\">tested positive</a> for the virus, Barnett welcomed the Labour MP Rachael Maskell, who\u2019d recently had a meeting with Dorries and so, after calling 111, decided to self-isolate. Maskell stays with her sister when working as an MP in London, she said. Barnett, always alert to detail, pounced. How was that working? Maskell has \u201ccreated a barrier\u201d, she said. \u201cHow have you done this?\u201d wondered Barnett, and we discovered that Maskell was, essentially, sitting in her bedroom, texting, calling and using her computer, only emerging to use the bathroom and, possibly, make cheese on toast. Listener Steve wondered if Maskell was getting full pay or sick pay, but she confessed she hadn\u2019t even asked as yet.</p> <p>Later, we got <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/key-points-from-budget-2020-at-a-glance\" title=\"\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/key-points-from-budget-2020-at-a-glance\" title=\"\">budget</a>, which was the usual shouting and sneering fest. Why were MPs going to the Houses of Parliament at all, wondered many 5 Live listeners, given that one of them had tested positive? Why couldn\u2019t they all just stay at home and listen to the radio for the chancellor\u2019s speech? \u201cWe\u2019d take it wherever Rishi Sunak was,\u201d agreed Barnett. \u201cWe\u2019d just link up the mics.\u201d If unnecessary gatherings are to be cancelled for health reasons, I do hope that parliament leads by example. All MPs should immediately self-isolate in their bedrooms, eat delivery pizza and attempt a spot of online work, before getting distracted by the internet, spraying around some disinfectant and spending three hours bitching about the state of the world on social media. Finally, they\u2019ll start to understand the youth of today.</p> <p>Or they could catch up on <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qpgr\" title=\"\">The Archers</a></strong>, which has gone tonto this week. Not a peep about Covid-19, but a surprise explosion at Grey Gables, which took out Lynda Snell (oh no!) and a random builder called Blake.</p> <p>A soil pipe was leaking under the kitchen floor, throwing the country hotel into some disarray: Fallon had to send over some emergency quiche. Philip agreed to have some of his builder lads sort out the kitchen \u2013 his son, Gavin, was one of them \u2013 and something must have gone wrong because the whole place exploded, just as Tracy was having a heart to heart withEmma about Emma divorcing Ed Grundy, and Lynda was telling the builders to stop making so much noise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62503ebe40c08250103cd3841af8be446d711f7b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62503ebe40c08250103cd3841af8be446d711f7b/0_0_4284_2856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carole Boyd as Lynda Snell in The Archers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The beating heart of Ambridge\u2026 Carole Boyd as Lynda Snell in The Archers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Gary Moyes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The explosion was a genuine shock. No foreshadowing, nothing to indicate it might happen: such is the way of unplanned explosions, I suppose. Silly Freddie Pargetter, who had spent the previous episode being cross with Lynda (it happens), ended up being trapped beneath the rubble with her, and had to try and drag her out, poor lad. Lynda said nothing at all: this did not bode well.</p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s episode, in the hospital, was very well done. Robert, Lynda\u2019s husband, was in bits, with Jim trying to talk him down: beautiful acting from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/mar/31/surrey-gp-reveals-archers-character-robert-snell-graham-blockey\" title=\"\">Graham </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/mar/31/surrey-gp-reveals-archers-character-robert-snell-graham-blockey\" title=\"\">Blockey</a> and John Rowe. And Freddie\u2019s talk to his auntie Shula (Toby Laurence and Judy Bennett) was also very moving: he didn\u2019t save Lynda, he said, he\u2019d given up. \u201cThe fire was right by her feet.\u201d</p> <p>Lynda Snell, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/2SBf17mJq4P9jsvHgJlZLlS/lynda-snell\" title=\"\">played by Carole Boyd</a>, is an <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thearchers/entries/824f33c7-e2dd-3812-ace7-9d9896c5c8c6\" title=\"\">immensely popular</a> <em>Archers</em> character \u2013 a meddling busybody, a know-all snob \u2013 and I do hope she\u2019s OK. But with a collapsed lung, fractured pelvis and \u201cfull-thickness burns\u201d, it doesn\u2019t sound good. If coronavirus brings too many infectious patients into Borchester General, Lynda may well be a goner. Which would be, for many <em>Archers</em> listeners, the absolute end.</p> <h2>Three great apocalyptic podcasts</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/war-worlds\" title=\"\">War of the Worlds</a></strong><br>Orson Welles\u2019s wireless dramatisation of HG Wells\u2019s <em>The War of the Worlds </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/nov/01/radio-broadcast-war-of-worlds\" title=\"\">famously caused </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/nov/01/radio-broadcast-war-of-worlds\" title=\"\">widespread panic</a> across the US after it was broadcast one evening in 1938. The wonderful Radiolab celebrated this event in one of its live episodes, and it\u2019s a lovely listen, as always. We get the facts \u2013 only around 1 in 12 people actually panicked when they heard it; we hear from those who believed it; and we also get consideration of whether such a broadcasting event could happen again. \u201cIt\u2019s the way that the story unfolded, step by step by step,\u201d says presenter Jad Abumrad\u2026</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.werealive.com/\" title=\"\">We\u2019re Alive/Goldrush</a></strong><br><em>We\u2019re Alive</em>, one of the best and earliest drama podcasts, ran from 2009-14, and is considered the gold standard of contemporary apocalypse shows. It\u2019s a full-on zombie affair, set in downtown Los Angeles, and there are 143 episodes, so you\u2019re in for a nice long binge-listen, if you happen to be stuck indoors for a long time. Plus, the company that made <em>We\u2019re Alive</em> has just put out a 10-part follow-up, <em>Goldrush</em>, set 17 years after <em>We\u2019re Alive</em>\u2019s main events. <em>We\u2019re Alive</em> is an imaginative teenagers\u2019 dream and nightmare rolled into one. Perfect for these crazy days.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://ashtales.com\" title=\"\">Ash Tales</a></strong><br>A fairly recent podcast, <em>Ash Tales</em> is a story show: we hear new short fiction about the end of the world, nicely narrated by presenter Ryan Law, with each episode coming in under 20 minutes. It\u2019s a spin-off from <em>Ash Tales</em>\u2019s main website, which showcases new writing about various end-of-the-world scenarios: super plagues, nuclear disasters, you know the stuff. It could perhaps do with a different narrator from time to time, and some added audio atmosphere, but the stories are great and this is a small, interesting British show that\u2019s worth supporting.</p>",

News of Trump\u2019s test followed days of controversy highlighted by his continuing to shake hands with people, even as official advice recommended \u201csocial distancing\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt becomes a habit. People walk up to me, they shake hands, it\u2019s kind of a natural reflex,\u201d Trump said. \u201cShaking hands is not a great thing to be doing right now, I tend to agree.\u201d</p> \n<p>He also indicated the extension of the travel ban, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-europe-travel-ban-to-the-us-begins-as-countries-ramp-up-efforts\">already in place for 26 European nations</a>. The vice-president, Mike Pence, duly announced that travelers from the UK and Ireland would be subject to the ban from midnight US eastern time on Monday.</p> \n<p>The president also raised the prospect of some kind of domestic travel restrictions, and advised the public: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have to travel I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump welcomed legislation passed by the US House that will help fund paid sick leave, unemployment insurance, free testing and other measures to help Americans affected by the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt will provide strong support for American families and communities in dealing with the coronavirus,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Nonetheless, the administration\u2019s response remains subject to criticism, particularly after the press conference on Friday. There, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/donald-trump-coronavirus-national-emergency\">announced a national emergency</a>, paving the way for billions of dollars to be made accessible to authorities attempting to slow the pandemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt opened up avenues we would never be able to open up without it,\u201d he said at the Saturday briefing. \u201cIt will make more than $50bn available to us in disaster relief funds.

As many as 20% of coronavirus infections could require patients to receive mechanical ventilation. If estimates of more than 1m infections prove accurate, there could be more than 200,000 such cases.</p> \n<p>According to a Johns Hopkins study based on data from 2010, US acute care hospitals own about 62,000 full-featured ventilators. The study, <a href=\"http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/resources/COVID-19/200214-VentilatorAvailability-factsheet.pdf\">published in February</a>, reported an additional 98,000 that can provide basic function.</p> \n<p>The CDC Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) has an estimated<a href=\"https://www.aarc.org/webcasts/mass-casualty-ventilation-and-the-strategic-national-stockpile/\"> 8,900 ventilators</a>.

In New York City the largest public school system in the US remains open, a key support for millions.

Earlier on Saturday, vice-president Mike Pence announced that the country\u2019s European travel ban would be extended to the UK and Ireland from midnight on Monday (eastern standard time).</li> \n   <li><strong>NHS and private hospitals join forces to fight coronavirus. </strong>The NHS is to form <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-nhs-private-hospitals-join-forces-academics-warn-over-strategy\">an unprecedented partnership</a> with the private health sector this week in an emergency plan to combat the Covid-19 crisis, amid fears the UK\u2019s publicly-funded hospitals will be unable to cope with the number of coronavirus patients. </li> \n   <li><strong>A group of more than 240 UK scientists have denounced the government\u2019s plan to achieve \u201cherd immunity\u201d by delaying measures to prevent the virus spreading. </strong>The group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/14/scientists-urge-government-to-enforce-social-distancing-now\">said that enforcing social distancing now</a> could save \u201cthousands of lives\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Spanish government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/spain-government-set-to-order-nationwide-coronavirus-lockdown\">formally declared</a> a state of emergency over the coronavirus, placing the country in lockdown and ordering people to stay at home for the next two weeks unless they have to buy food or medicine or go to work or hospital.</strong> The measures are set to come into effect on Monday morning and follows in the example set by France hours earlier, which announced the closure all public places \u201cnon-essential\u201d from midnight on Saturday. </li> \n   <li><strong>Spanish PM\u2019s wife tests positive for coronavirus. </strong>The Spanish government announced that the prime minister\u2019s wife, Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Both Gomez and her husband, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, are doing well and remain at their official residence in Madrid, the Moncloa palace, the government said in a statement.</li> \n   <li><strong>Israel proposes uses anti-terrorism tracking tech. </strong>Israel has \u2013 like France and Spain \u2013 announced a partial closure of the country, shutting down hotels, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and malls. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu added that he hopes to deploy anti-terrorism tracking technology to locate people who have been in contact with those carrying the virus. He said he had requested Justice Ministry approval because such measures could infringe patients\u2019 privacy.\u201cThe enemy is invisible, but we must locate it,\u201d Netanyahu said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Colombia closes border with Venezuela and Ecuador bans foreigners. </strong>Colombia overnight closed its border with Venezuela in order to stem the spread of Covid-19 in the South American nation. The move to shut the border came overnight, after Venezuela confirmed its first two cases of Covid-19 on Friday morning. Colombia currently has 22 confirmed cases of Covid-19, but its government appears to view Venezuela - with fewer cases - as a possible centre of an outbreak in Latin America. Meanwhile, Ecuador announced it would ban foreigners from entering the country by land, sea or air. Citizens and residents will be able to enter until Monday, after which they will also face restrictions. Gatherings larger than 30 people have also been banned.</li> \n   <li><strong>Libya\u2019s Tripoli-based Government of National Accord has declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus and will close all air and sea ports from Monday, prime minister Fayez al-Serraj said on Saturday.</strong> Libya, split for years between rival governments that have been fighting a war for nearly a year, lacks adequate isolation and other facilities to combat the virus, the head of its disease control centre told Reuters on Thursday.</li> \n   <li><strong>Rwanda, Seychelles and Central African Republic confirmed their first coronavirus cases on Saturday \u2013 bringing the total number of African countries that have reported positive tests for the virus to 23. </strong>Sudan has ordered the closure of schools and universities for one month from Saturday to stop the spread of coronavirus, a statement from the prime minister\u2019s office said. While Morocco has banned flight to and from as many as 25 countries.</li> \n   <li><strong>Global number of confirmed cases stands at 156,098, with 5,819 deaths. </strong>As of today 72,621 people have recovered, according to <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University</a>.

on the situation in Colombia and Venezula from my Bogota-based colleague <strong>Joe Parkin Daniels</strong> :</p> \n  <p>Colombia overnight closed its border with Venezuela in order to stem the spread of Covid-19 in the South American nation, a move that is likely to have lasting ramifications given the scale of Venezuela\u2019s migration crisis.</p> \n  <p>About 4.5 million people have fled Venezuela which, despite boasting the planet\u2019s largest proven oil reserves, remains mired in years-long economic and social turmoil. Hyperinflation is rampant, with shortages in basic foodstuffs and medical supplies already a daily reality. Around 1.4 million of those that have left have arrived to Colombia, which shares a 1,378-mile border with Venezuela.</p> \n  <p>Authorities estimate as many as 40,000 people cross the border every day, the majority of which buy supplies - medicines and food staples - and return home.</p> \n  <p>The move to shut the border came overnight, after Venezuela confirmed its first two cases of Covid-19 on Friday morning.</p> \n  <p>The two countries broke diplomatic relations when Colombia ceased to recognise its embattled leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, as the country\u2019s legitimate president in early 2019, as part of an ongoing US-led coalition to oust him from office. Analysts say that will hamper coordination to contain a virus that does not respect borders.</p> \n  <p>Others worry that the closure will force desperate Venezuelans to cross informally, putting them at risk of armed groups operating along the border. </p> \n  <p>\u201cColombia\u2019s overnight decision to \u2018close\u2019 its porous border with Venezuela won\u2019t stop the flow of people,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GRamsey_LatAm/status/1238832345916071936\">tweeted</a> Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert at the Washington Office on Latin America. \u201cBut it will force them to rely more on informal crossings where they\u2019ll be more vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Colombia currently has 22 confirmed cases of Covid-19, but its government appears to view Venezuela - with fewer cases - as a possible centre of an outbreak in Latin America. Iv\u00e1n Duque M\u00e1rquez, Colombia\u2019s president, described the closure in a statement as \u201ca measure of protection ahead of the situation unfolding in [Venezuela].\u201d</p> \n  <p>M\u00e1rquez also announced overnight a ban on travellers who have been in Europe or Asia in the last 14 days, with the exceptions of Colombian citizens and residents.</p> \n  <p>All measures are expected to last until 30 May.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T17:41:21.305Z\">at 5.41pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6d11628f085c6327bbff36\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T17:21:57.821Z\">5.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the UK, a newborn baby tested positive for coronavirus at a north London hospital <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/newborn-baby-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-in-london\">earlier today</a>. </p> \n  <p>The child\u2019s mother, who was taken to a north <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london\">London</a> hospital days before the birth with suspected pneumonia, has also caught the virus.</p> \n  <p>Richard Tedder, visiting professor in medical virology, Imperial College London, said this raises \u201cconcerns about the potential ways in which this transmission may have occurred\u201d.</p> \n  <p>He told PA Media:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is important to say at this point in time that the detection of Covid-19 nucleic acid on the sample from the child does not necessarily mean that the child was infected. </p> \n   <p>It could well have come from the mother at the time of delivery, further follow-up of the infant will clarify whether or not the infant is infected.</p> \n   <p>Previous data from colleagues in China, published in the journal The Lancet, albeit on a small number of mother and infant pairs, did not show infection in any of the infants at the time of birth. Neither did sampling of breast milk immediately after birth contain detectable virus. Thus, the UK observation of a possible neonatal transmission is unexpected and needs further confirmation.</p> \n   <p>The question of risk to a newly born child being nursed by a mother who is known to be infected is a matter that will need careful consideration. </p> \n   <p>The absence of detectable virus in breast milk would appear to reduce the risk of breastfeeding however the close, intimate and entirely understandable contact between a mother and her baby will raise questions about how best to care for them. Compounding this too is the lack of knowledge of the clinical outcome of neonatal infection, should this actually occur.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6d10118f088d75755936d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T17:14:19.548Z\">5.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Italy\u2019s coronavirus death toll rose to 1,441 from 1,266 on Friday, according to official data.

The son developed symptoms a fortnight after returning to India. Officials are trying to trace the 1,500 people he may have been in contact with at the large plant where he worked. </p> \n  <p>Her family complained that the cemetery they took her to refused to cremate her. Crematoriums in India tended to be crowded and the staff felt at risk. It was only when doctors arrived to prescribe the right protocol that her last rites were performed. The number of coronavirus cases in India stands at 84.</p> \n  <p>With no hand sanitisers available, the New Delhi government has designated them \u2018essential commodities\u2019 so that anyone hoarding them or selling them at inflated prices can be punished by law.</p> \n  <p> As stories trickle in of some people concealing their travel history to affected areas or refusing to be tested and, if necessary, isolated, the Delhi government has also invoked the Epidemic Act. This allows district magistrates to take coercive action to isolate high-risk people. </p> \n  <p>The wife of a Google employee in Bengaluru, for example, fled her home and vanished last week. Officials found that she had flown to Delhi \u2013 at the other end of the country - and travelled by train to Agra to her parents\u2019 home.</p> \n  <p>Across many states, social life is being curbed with weddings, engagement ceremonies and birthday parties banned in the south Indian state of Karnataka. The message to Indians is to stay at home and avoid large gatherings. Several states have closed swimming pools, gyms, cinemas, night clubs, and theatres. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6ccf648f088d7575593533\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T12:40:21.340Z\">12.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A petition calling for the UK to go into lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus has reached more than 110,000 signatures, meaning it will be considered for parliamentary debate. </p> \n  <p>It encourages the UK to follow the containment procedures of countries that have been widely affected by the outbreak, by restricting unnecessary travel and discouraging public gatherings. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt is time the government should prioritise the health of the public and should consider how vital it is to implement effective containment now,\u201d the petition says. \u201cIt is better to spend money to contain the virus and treating the relatively low numbers who are ill now rather than wait for more casualties.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The government responds to all petitions with more than 10,000 signatures, and considers any petition with more than 100,000 signatures for parliamentary debate.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T12:41:07.909Z\">at 12.41pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6ccdf18f085c6327bbfd82\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T12:29:53.448Z\">12.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This video explores how Islam has been impacted by coronavirus.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Donald Trump given coronavirus all clear</h2> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s physician, Sean Conley, has confirmed the US president does not have Covid-19. A memo from Conley said that the president had agreed to be tested for the virus following an \u201cin-depth discussion\u201d on Friday night. A week earlier he had dinner with a Brazilian official who later tested positive. Earlier on Saturday, vice-president Mike Pence announced that the country\u2019s European travel ban would be extended to the UK and Ireland from midnight on Monday (eastern standard time).</p> <h2>NHS and private hospitals join forces to fight coronavirus</h2> <p>The NHS is to form an unprecedented partnership with the private health sector this week in an emergency plan to combat the Covid-19 crisis, amid fears the UK\u2019s publicly funded hospitals will be unable to cope with the number of patients. Meanwhile, a group of more than 200 UK scientists have denounced the government\u2019s plan to achieve \u201cherd immunity\u201d by delaying measures to prevent the virus spreading. The group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/14/scientists-urge-government-to-enforce-social-distancing-now\">said that enforcing social distancing now</a> could save \u201cthousands of lives\u201d.</p> <h2>Lockdown announced in Spain</h2> <p>The Spanish government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/spain-government-set-to-order-nationwide-coronavirus-lockdown\">formally declared</a> a state of emergency over the coronavirus, placing the country in lockdown and ordering people to stay at home for the next two weeks unless they have to buy food or medicine or go to work or hospital. The measures are set to come into effect on Monday morning and follow the example set by France hours earlier, which announced the closure of all \u201cnon-essential\u201d public places from midnight on Saturday. Restaurants, cafes, cinemas and discos will be closed under the measures. Pharmacies and places selling other basic necessities will be exempted.</p> <h2>Spanish PM\u2019s wife tests positive for coronavirus</h2> <p>The Spanish government announced that the prime minister\u2019s wife, Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Both Gomez and her husband, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, are doing well and remain at their official residence in Madrid, the Moncloa palace, the government said in a statement.</p> <h2>Israel proposes use of anti-terrorism tracking tech</h2> <p>Israel has \u2013 like France and Spain \u2013 announced a partial closure of the country, shutting hotels, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and malls. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu added that he hopes to deploy anti-terrorism tracking technology to locate people who have been in contact with those carrying the virus. He said he had requested Justice Ministry approval because such measures could infringe patients\u2019 privacy. \u201cThe enemy is invisible, but we must locate it,\u201d Netanyahu said.</p> <h2>Colombia closes border with Venezuela and Ecuador bans foreigners</h2> <p>Colombia closed its border with Venezuela in order to stem the spread of Covid-19 in the South American nation. The move to shut the border came overnight, after Venezuela \u200bconfirmed its first two cases of Covid-19 on Friday morning. Colombia currently has 22 confirmed cases of Covid-19, but its government appears to view Venezuela \u2013 with fewer cases \u2013 as a possible centre\u200b of an outbreak in Latin America. Meanwhile, Ecuador announced it would ban foreigners from entering the country by land, sea or air. Citizens and residents will be able to enter until Monday, after which they will also face restrictions. Gatherings larger than 30 people have also been banned.</p> <h2>State of emergency announced in Libya</h2> <p>Libya\u2019s Tripoli-based Government of National Accord has declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus and will close all air and sea ports from Monday, prime minister Fayez al-Serraj said on Saturday. Libya, split for years between rival governments that have been fighting a war for nearly a year, lacks adequate isolation and other facilities to combat the virus, the head of its disease control centre told Reuters on Thursday.</p> <h2>Number of African countries to report Covid-19 cases rises</h2> <p>Rwanda, Seychelles and Central African Republic confirmed their first coronavirus cases on Saturday \u2013 bringing the total number of African countries that have reported positive tests for the virus to 23. Sudan has ordered the closure of schools and universities for one month from Saturday to stop the spread of coronavirus, a statement from the prime minister\u2019s office said. Morocco has banned flights to and from as many as 25 countries.</p> <h2><strong>Global number of confirmed cases stands at 156,098, with 5,819 deaths</strong></h2> <p>As of today 72,621 people have recovered, according to <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University</a>. The institution runs a live tracker of coronavirus cases, based on official figures, meaning that the true figures may be somewhat higher.</p>"
