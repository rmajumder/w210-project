instead a fundamental flaw in the way the program was designed by Morrison and his treasurer, Josh Frydenberg.</p> \n<p>And expecting businesses that are already broke to borrow more money is also pretty rich.</p> \n<p>Banks have so far <a href=\"https://www.ausbanking.org.au/banks-bolster-efforts-to-help-businesses-bridge-the-gap-to-jobkeeper/\">loaned $700m</a> to businesses to help them get through the crisis \u2013 which sounds like a lot but really isn\u2019t anywhere near enough.</p> \n<p>Guardian Australia understands about half has come from Australia\u2019s biggest bank, the Commonwealth, and reports from businesses suggest smaller banks have struggled to get their systems up to scratch quickly.</p> \n<p>But the big problem with going to the bank is that businesses are borrowing to get behind.</p> \n<p>This is, once again, because the jobkeeper payment is made after the fact.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related:

next month \u2026 and have to immediately borrow the money again to meet the next month\u2019s payroll.</p> \n<p>While banks are offering an interest deferral for six months, that just means interest payments are quietly compounding in the background, ready to mug business owners when the crisis is over and they\u2019re expected to resume making payments.</p> \n<p>As a result, many businesses have done the sums and closed their doors rather than get further into hock.</p> \n<p>For the Liberal party, which is supposed to be the champion of small business, a failure to understand the basics of cashflow seems mind-boggling.</p> \n<p>But the Morrison government made two design decisions that made this problem inevitable.</p> \n<p>First, they decided not to pay workers directly, as the UK does \u2013 asked about this, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, has previously <a href=\"https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/coronavirus/2020/03/27/wage-aid-mathias-cormann/\">claimed</a> this \u201cwould not work\u201d in Australia.</p> \n<p>He\u2019s never really explained why, given that the Rudd government was able to use ATO systems to put government money in people\u2019s bank accounts during the global financial crisis.</p> \n<p>Once the government decided to use the business tax system to make the payments, they made the second decision that ensured things would go wrong: to pay in arrears.</p> \n<p>One of the attractions of using the business tax system to make payments is that tax boffins have a very good idea of the finances of every business in Australia because of a system called single touch payroll, which <a href=\"https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Other-languages/In-detail/Information-in-other-languages/Single-Touch-Payroll/\">requires</a> businesses to send wages, super and tax information to the ATO at the same time as they do their regular payroll run.</p> \n<p>This means the ATO will be able to check that correct jobkeeper payments have been made.</p> \n<p>But it also means that payments could also be made in advance, and then checked against the actual payroll.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom

There is as yet no drug that has been shown to be effective against the coronavirus, which has killed more than 180,000 people worldwide.</p> \n<p>The limited evidence around hydroxychloroquine so far has come in a steady stream of scientific studies, often as soon as they are posted online as \u201cpreprints\u201d \u2013 ie before they have gone through the rigorous vetting process known as peer review. None of the studies that have been released meet the gold standard for demonstrating a drug\u2019s effectiveness \u2013 a large-scale, double-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT), though multiple trials of that kind are under way.</p> \n<p>While the world awaits those results, here\u2019s a guide to some of the studies released thus far:</p> \n<h2>In vitro v in vivo</h2> \n<p>In early February, the journal <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0282-0?fbclid=IwAR3c5iy9h65X1cnkrL6i6fJcWwi0ygN1LtI67SkcgREM4DyxxAcPauRuf5w\">Cell Research</a> published a letter to the editor by Chinese scientists reporting the results of their experiments looking at whether existing drugs might be effective against the coronavirus. The scientists tested five drugs in vitro \u2013 meaning on cells infected with the virus in a laboratory rather than in humans \u2013 and found promising results for two: remdesivir and chloroquine. (Chloroquine is a close relative to hydroxychloroquine, which is considered safer.)</p> \n<p><strong>Caveats:</strong> There is a big difference between a drug showing promise in a laboratory and working in patients. Scientists have gotten similarly promising results with hydroxychloroquine against various viruses in <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanrhe/article/PIIS2665-9913(20)30089-8/fulltext\">past in vitro studies</a>, including against the first Sars, but have yet to show its effectiveness against any virus in RCTs.</p> \n<h2>The controversial French study</h2> \n<p>Much of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/hydroxychloroquine-trump-coronavirus-drug\">media hype</a> around hydroxychloroquine stems from a French study of the drug which purported to show significant reduction in viral load for patients treated with a combination of HCQ and azithromycin, a common antibiotic. The study was a clinical trial, meaning it involved actual patients, and underwent peer review before <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300996?via%3Dihub\">publication</a> in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents (IJAA).</p> \n<p><strong>Caveats:</strong> There are numerous problems with this study\u2019s design and the way its results were reported. The researchers downplayed the clinical outcomes \u2013 ie whether or not the patient improved, got worse or died \u2013 and instead based their analysis on measuring how long a patient was shedding the virus \u2013 ie whether the researchers were able to detect its presence from a nasal swab. All of the four patients with clear bad outcomes (three went to the ICU and one died) received the HCQ but were excluded from the viral shedding analysis. The researchers said that the remaining patients who received the drug shed virus for a shorter duration. This opened the door for people promoting the drug to <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/over-three-days-week-fox-news-promoted-antimalarial-drug-treatment-coronavirus-over-100\">mischaracterize</a> their results and say they showed a \u201c100% cure rate\u201d.</p> \n<p>The professional association affiliated with the IJAA has <a href=\"https://www.isac.world/news-and-publications/official-isac-statement\">said</a> the article \u201cdoes not meet the society\u2019s expected standard\u201d, and the publisher has initiated <a href=\"https://www.isac.world/news-and-publications/isac-elsevier-statement\">additional independent peer review</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e299a7f3-c36b-4565-aeb3-0f89c8c5cbf5\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZTXpRNIDpy0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Meanwhile, the group of French scientists has continued to publish <a href=\"https://www.mediterranee-infection.com/pre-prints-ihu/\">preprints</a> reporting results on their continued use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin on patients in Marseille, without any control group.</p> \n<h2><strong>A small Chinese clinical trial</strong></h2> \n<p>In early April, Chinese scientists published a <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040758v3.full.pdf\">study</a> looking at 62 patients with mild cases of Covid-19. Unlike the French trial, the study was randomized and the treatment and control groups were comparable. The study found a statistically significant difference in the time it took the two groups to recover, with patients who received HCQ showing shorter periods of fever and cough.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/hydroxychloroquine-trump-coronavirus-drug\">Hydroxychloroquine: how an unproven drug became Trump\u2019s coronavirus 'miracle cure'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>Caveats:</strong> The number of patients involved was very small, and the researchers did not include any patients with severe or critical illness. This paper has not yet been peer-reviewed. The study authors concluded that their results \u201cpartially confirmed\u201d the potential of HCQ as a treatment, but they said large-scale trials were still needed, as well as basic research to understand the mechanism by which the drug is affecting people.</p> \n<h2>A retrospective analysis of patient data from France</h2> \n<p>While awaiting the results of large-scale clinical trials, some scientists have performed retrospective analyses of real-life patients to emulate a clinical trial. This works by selecting a cohort of patients who received the drug and an equivalent cohort who did not and then comparing their outcomes. In a French <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.20060699v1.full.pdf\">retrospective analysis</a> posted as a preprint in mid-April, researchers found \u201cno evidence\u201d that HCQ was an effective treatment when comparing 84 patients who received the drug and 97 who did not.</p> \n<p><strong>Caveats:</strong> Retrospective analyses are not a substitute for RCTs. One clear confounding factor is that researchers do not know why physicians decided to treat some patients with HCQ and others not. The paper has also not yet been peer-reviewed.</p> \n<h2>Red flags in an aborted Brazilian trial</h2> \n<p>While chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are considered safe for their approved uses, they do have side-effects, including increasing the risk of heart arrhythmias in some people. In mid-April, a group of researchers in Brazil posted a <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20056424v2\">preprint</a> revealing that they had called a halt to a clinical trial of chloroquine at high doses after they observed high rates of arrhythmias and a large number of deaths.</p> \n<p>The paper was <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2765270\">published</a> on 24 April by Jama Network Open following peer review, with the authors\u2019 recommendation that the high dose of chloroquine \u201cshould not be recommended\u201d for patients with severe Covid-19 due to the safety concerns. An accompanying <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2765269\">editorial</a> by three American physicians advised that the results \u201cshould prompt some degree of skepticism toward the enthusiastic claims about chloroquine and perhaps serve to curb the exuberant use\u201d. </p> \n<p><strong>Caveats:</strong> The Brazilian trial was designed to compare the efficacy of two different doses of chloroquine, and it did not include a control group that only received a placebo. Researchers found the higher dose, which they chose because it was recommended by Chinese authorities, to be unsafe, but they are continuing to test the efficacy of a lower dose. They were not able to conclude definitively that the high dose of chloroquine was causing cardiac side effects, but described the \u201cred flags\u201d as sufficient to warrant their recommendation.</p> \n<h2>A retrospective analysis of US veterans</h2> \n<p>Similarly to the French retrospective analysis, researchers in the US looked at the <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20065920v1\">outcomes for 368 patients</a> who were treated for Covid-19 in the country\u2019s Veterans Health Administration hospitals. The patients were broken into three groups: those who received HCQ, those who received HCQ and azithromycin, and those who did not receive HCQ. They found that HCQ, with or without azithromycin, did not reduce a patient\u2019s need for a ventilator or reduce the risk of death. They also found that those who received HCQ alone had a higher risk of death than those who did not.</p> \n<p><strong>Caveats:</strong> The analysis was limited to male patients. As with the French retrospective analysis, this study is not a substitute for RCTs. One major confounding factor is that the patients who received HCQ were more severely ill. The researchers say that they accounted for this in their statistical analysis and still found a higher mortality rate for those receiving HCQ. The study has not yet been peer-reviewed.</p> \n<h2>US government recommendations</h2> \n<p>A panel of experts put together by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the agency led by Dr Anthony Fauci, released <a href=\"https://covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/\">treatment guidelines</a> for Covid-19 on 21 April. The panel said that there was insufficient data to \u201crecommend either for or against\u201d hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine. However, the panel recommended <em>against</em> the use of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin due to the risk of cardiac arrhythmia.</p> \n<p>On 24 April, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a \u201cdrug safety communication\u201d warning against the use of either hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine outside a hospital setting or clinical trial due to reports of \u201cserious heart rhythm problems\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cHydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have not been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing Covid-19,\u201d the communication stated.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>This article has been updated to correct the version of the drug that was used in the Brazilian trial. It was chloroquine, not hydroxychloroquine.</em></p></li> \n <li><p><em>Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.

  "<p>The leader of the most prominent group in the US peddling potentially lethal industrial bleach as a \u201cmiracle cure\u201d for coronavirus wrote to Donald Trump at the White House this week.</p> \n<p>In his letter, Mark Grenon told Trump that chlorine dioxide \u2013 a powerful bleach used in industrial processes such as textile manufacturing that can have fatal side-effects when drunk \u2013 is \u201ca wonderful detox that can kill 99% of the pathogens in the body\u201d. He added that it \u201ccan rid the body of Covid-19\u201d.</p> \n<p>A few days after Grenon dispatched his letter, Trump went on national TV at his daily coronavirus briefing at the White House on Thursday and promoted the idea that disinfectant could be used as a treatment for the virus. To the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/trump-coronavirus-treatment-disinfectant\">astonishment of medical experts</a>, the US president said that disinfectant \u201cknocks it out in a minute. One minute!\u201d</p> \n<p>He went on to say: \u201cIs there a way we can do something, by an injection inside or almost a cleaning?

But the Guardian has learned that peddlers of chlorine dioxide \u2013 industrial bleach \u2013 have been making direct approaches to the White House in recent days.</p> \n<p>Grenon styles himself as \u201carchbishop\u201d of Genesis II \u2013 a Florida-based outfit that claims to be a church but which in fact is the largest producer and distributor of chlorine dioxide bleach as a \u201cmiracle cure\u201d in the US. He brands the chemical as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/19/church-group-to-hold-washington-event-despite-fda-warnings-against-miracle-cure\">MMS</a>, \u201cmiracle mineral solution\u201d, and claims fraudulently that it can cure 99% of all illnesses including cancer, malaria, HIV/Aids as well as autism.</p> \n<p>Since the start of the pandemic, Genesis II has been marketing MMS as a cure to coronavirus. It advises users, including children, to mix three to six drops of bleach in water and drink it.</p> \n<p>In his weekly televised radio show, <a href=\"https://www.brighteon.com/aedb4e1b-3a47-434f-8548-7efe585a1cf1?fbclid=IwAR3iLyvkChEDLLv1_6gwu6A9ky2Zc93Ih0nBhiCPi5DoZQG2VjXarnIkmdw\">posted online</a> on Sunday, Grenon read out the letter he wrote to Trump. He said it began: \u201cDear Mr President, I am praying you read this letter and intervene.\u201d</p> \n<p>Grenon said that 30 of his supporters have also written in the past few days to Trump at the White House urging him to take action to protect Genesis II in its bleach-peddling activities which they claim can cure coronavirus.</p> \n<p>On Friday, hours after Trump talked about disinfectant on live TV, Grenon went further in a post on his <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mark.grenon\">Facebook page</a>. He claimed that MMS had actually been sent to the White House. He wrote: \u201cTrump has got the MMS and all the info!!! Things are happening folks! Lord help others to see the Truth!\u201d</p> \n<p>Paradoxically, Trump\u2019s outburst about the possible value of an \u201cinjection\u201d of disinfectant into the lungs of Covid-19 sufferers came just days after a leading agency within the president\u2019s own administration took action to shut down the peddling of bleach as a coronavirus cure around the US.</p> \n<p>Last week the US Food and Drug Administration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/bleach-coronavirus-us-orders-group-stop-selling\">obtained a federal court order</a> barring Genesis II from selling what was described as \u201can unproven and potentially harmful treatment for Covid-19\u201d. The FDA also ordered a disciple of Genesis II, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mms-bleach-advocates-telegram-photos-child-injuries-2020-4\">Kerri Rivera</a>, to remove claims that MMS cured coronavirus from her website.</p> \n<p>Last August the FDA issued an urgent warning urging Americans not to buy or drink MMS, which it said was a \u201cdangerous bleach which has caused serious and potentially life-threatening side effects\u201d. Drinking MMS can cause nausea, diarrhea and severe dehydration that can lead to death, the federal agency said.</p> \n<p>The Guardian contacted the White House asking whether Grenon\u2019s letter had influenced Trump\u2019s comments on disinfectant, but did not immediately receive a response. </p> \n<p>Another advocate of bleach as a miracle cure who has been seeking to interest Trump in the treatment is Alan Keyes. He is a former ambassador and adviser to Ronald Reagan who ran unsuccessfully as a Republican candidate for the US Senate and on three occasions for the US presidency.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"29ae219a-db38-4e74-b8e0-effde9cb787b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1bX8kEHTbug?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Keyes has featured Genesis II bleach products as a miracle cure on his online conservative TV show, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=373915986891765&amp;ref=watch_permalink\">Let\u2019s Talk America</a>.</p> \n<p>It is not known whether Keyes has discussed MMS with Trump.

Data has to be robust, recording of ethnicity both by country of origin or ethnic group is hugely complex.

Once the disease is more prevalent, this becomes a less effective mechanism, she adds.</p> \n  <p>Once our rates are very tightly controlled, even then it isn\u2019t so simple, she says, due to variations in reliability in recording temperature and the likelihood in catching somebody during the incubation period. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea3140b8f08e05690dc418a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T16:35:03.891Z\">5.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q.

said Wales\u2019s plan was \u201ca contribution to crafting that UK approach but sharing with one another our thinking, by being open about the issues we think will matter in different parts of the

be able to make changes to the restrictions and see a gradual return to something resembling normal life.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Dr Atherton said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> Action to ease the lockdown restrictions will need to be supported by a comprehensive public health response, which will need to be developed quickly and at scale.</p> \n   <p>We are now working

the lockdown depends on the speed at which the number of new cases of Covid-19 falls and that is as yet \u201cunknown\u201d, the health secretary, <strong>Matt Hancock,</strong> has said.</p> \n  <p>The number of new cases is being tracked through hospital admissions, through a new testing study in the community announced on Wednesday, and data that will be gathered from people coming forward for tests under an expansion of the programme.</p> \n  <p>However, he added that there was no prospect of easing the lockdown yet, and that cases needed to drop substantially before the next phase of isolating infected people and their contacts could be truly effective.</p> \n  <p>Through a process of mass testing and by isolating infected people and their contacts, ministers hope that future localised outbreaks of coronavirus can be kept under control.</p> \n  <p>Hancock told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Now that we\u2019re at the peak, and we very much hope that things will start to slow down and, if and when they do, then the speed with which the number of new cases reduces will, frankly, determine how long we need to keep the measures on, and that is as yet unknown.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He said contact tracing worked better when the number of infections was pushed right down.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The truth is that we need to get the number of new cases down, right down, and the lower you go, the more effective contact tracing is because the more resources you can put into each individual case that gets a positive test.</p> \n   <p>You can really make sure you can get hold of all of their contacts and get them, in many cases, to self-isolate.</p> \n   <p>The smaller the number of new cases, the more effective the test, track and trace system will be.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Physical distancing was driving down the numbers, Hancock said, adding that the contact tracing operation would be functioning in a \u201cmatter of weeks\u201d.</p> \n  <p>He said mass testing, contact tracing and a new contact tracing app were \u201cso crucial to holding down the rate and level of transmission of the disease\u201d.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T11:15:50.120Z\">at 12.15pm BST</time></p>

Campbell said that an argument between the two might have been \u201cthe catalyst of events\u201d over the weekend.</p> <p>The first victim found by police on Saturday night was a driver with a gunshot wound in the rural town of Portapique, set in thick forest. Fanning out across the crime scene, officers found several buildings on fire \u2013 and 13 other victims.</p> <p>Authorities soon realized the suspected gunman owned several decommissioned police cruisers, but officers initially mistakenly believed all were accounted for.

The previous week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2020/mar/13/cheltenham-festival-2020-in-pictures\">I had photographed the Cheltenham </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2020/mar/13/cheltenham-festival-2020-in-pictures\">festival</a>, an event I associate with the end of winter, spring coming, the light getting better. A chance to look ahead to a summer of sport, going to events that I love. But this year, the festival had felt all wrong \u2013 more like a dangerous party on the eve of war. It seemed all around me the news was harrowing, and sport was getting hammered as event after event was cancelled. My world had suddenly been turned upside-down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"0e6d7db7b355bf1ce59c465d4c53e6d4e9a1164c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e6d7db7b355bf1ce59c465d4c53e6d4e9a1164c/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A close-up of the tulip variety Mystik Van Eijk, 10 April\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A close-up of Mystik Van Eijk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>A close-up of Mystik Van Eijk, 10 April.</p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"615c28b7e62186046b52e09b21a7b98c3fb8cb3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/615c28b7e62186046b52e09b21a7b98c3fb8cb3e/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A pot filled with the tulip variety Christmas Dream, 4 April\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pot filled with the tulip variety Christmas Dream, 4 April</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>A pot filled with Christmas Dream, 4 April.</p></li> </ul> <p>I realised then that I had to reframe and refocus. With all my normal avenues for taking pictures closed off, I needed to find something else. I recalled the words of Ed Jackson, a former professional rugby player <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/03/ed-jackson-rugby-interview-everest\">whose portrait I had taken exactly a year earlier</a>. After suffering an awful accident that had left him partially paralysed, he had developed a mental process to cope with his new situation: focus on what\u2019s in front of you, focus on things you can affect, and try to forget what\u2019s out of your control.</p> <p>Remembering this, I looked round the edge of the tiny piece of lawn and noticed some tulip bulbs that my wife had planted in terracotta pots. Lush green leaves with buds full of promise had emerged from the soil, ready to bloom. In these plants, I saw hope. I saw normality.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"12883e39c8eae889971f84fc01a15146a7a637ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12883e39c8eae889971f84fc01a15146a7a637ba/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mystik Van Eijk, 6 April\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mystik Van Eijk, 6 April</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Mystik Van Eijk, with water droplets, print available <a href=\"https://guardianprintshop.com/collections/home-not-away-the-tulip-project\">here</a>. </p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"3070f55a98bf56f8865f87855812d43bf31afb88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3070f55a98bf56f8865f87855812d43bf31afb88/0_0_3528_5292/667.jpg\" alt=\"Christmas Dream tulip\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The tulip variety Christmas Dream, 20 March</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"537bf8b4084de7768142803239150595cf4cf747\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/537bf8b4084de7768142803239150595cf4cf747/0_0_4000_6000/667.jpg\" alt=\"The tulip variety Christmas Dream, 20 March\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The tulip variety Christmas Dream, 20 March</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"3385546d80184804c401ea9c07b9980f5d777be5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3385546d80184804c401ea9c07b9980f5d777be5/0_0_3860_5790/667.jpg\" alt=\"A close-up of the tulip variety Christmas Dream, 10 April\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A close-up of the tulip variety Christmas Dream, 10 April</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"e63f7479cb871c7682645d2a62df0e6eca7fab09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e63f7479cb871c7682645d2a62df0e6eca7fab09/0_0_4000_6000/667.jpg\" alt=\"A close-up of the tulip variety Christmas Dream, 10 April\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A close-up of the tulip variety Christmas Dream, 10 April</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Christmas Dreams.</p></li> </ul> <p>It occurred to me then that this process of growth and positivity deserved to be documented. Despite the global madness, nature was thriving \u2013 and these tulips seemed to be begging me to tell their story. To me, photography is more than just a career: it is my passion, and in these flowers I found the perfect opportunity to take pictures without leaving my home.</p> <p>To test myself, I decided not to use any of my main professional cameras. These are more used to the hurly-burly of sport, all fast focusing and speedy motor-drive. Instead, I turned to what I call my \u201choliday camera\u201d, an upmarket point-and-shoot that I take away on trips with the family (the last thing I want on holiday is to be surrounded by items associated with work, many of which are heavy). Light, easy to manoeuvre around the plants, and \u2013 most crucially \u2013 able to focus close-up, this small camera actually turned out to be perfect for this project.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"c79c7f200df03d74d163d70c0211df4c7592f1ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c79c7f200df03d74d163d70c0211df4c7592f1ab/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A close-up of a Red Revival tulip, 4 April\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A close-up of a Red Revival tulip, 4 April</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Red Revival.</p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c813c3e05167be5805e9046f340badda19c49529\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c813c3e05167be5805e9046f340badda19c49529/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A close-up of the tulip variety White Prince, 4 April\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A close-up of White Prince, 4 April</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>White Prince, print available <a href=\"https://guardianprintshop.com/collections/home-not-away-the-tulip-project\">here</a>. </p></li> </ul> <p>As the sun moved round the garden during the day, backgrounds became dark and shadows on the flowers created gorgeous patterns. I would note which times were best to photograph certain plants, and would periodically drop whichever household task I was doing (much to the irritation of my family) to race to the garden and catch the flowers in the perfect light.</p> <p>Like all photographers, I look to light as another tool in the box, an opportunity to create something different. By varying angles, I could make petals look like paper, tightly bunched flower heads look like lips. Going in tight, I attempted to show the beauty of the flowers in a surreal way. The warm spring sunshine of the last few weeks had not only ushered the tulips into full bloom but enhanced their colour and vibrancy, so some of my photographs gained an almost unearthly quality.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"8b1079be631eb6b2906b9006056bee4f811da7ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b1079be631eb6b2906b9006056bee4f811da7ae/16_16_3805_5965/638.jpg\" alt=\"Mystik Van Eijk, 23 March\" width=\"638\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mystik Van Eijk, 23 March</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"1d7ea96ef78d21f5fc2ad7b6b6b18457e2bf6a06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d7ea96ef78d21f5fc2ad7b6b6b18457e2bf6a06/185_3_3737_5857/638.jpg\" alt=\"A Christmas Dream, 14 April\" width=\"638\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Christmas Dream, 14 April</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"11a528fe59c2328db8cc42ecf0a280eb7c4f1ce1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11a528fe59c2328db8cc42ecf0a280eb7c4f1ce1/0_0_3869_5804/667.jpg\" alt=\"Mystik Van Eijk, 9 April\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mystik Van Eijk, 9 April</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"64d37c1df80fd4630a3f2662a3f06a077e5a955b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64d37c1df80fd4630a3f2662a3f06a077e5a955b/40_5_2686_4025/667.jpg\" alt=\"A view after rain of the tulip variety Christmas Dream, 19 March\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A view after rain of the tulip variety Christmas Dream, 19 March</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve never felt so lucky to have my garden, this tiny oasis in densely crowded north London.

  "<p>As a hospital consultant who has three children working on the NHS frontline, two of whom contracted coronavirus, I find the continuing debacle over personal protective equipment shocking (<a href=\"theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/how-do-teenagers-live-in-quarantine-photo-essay\" title=\"\">Government misses out on 16m face masks for NHS in four weeks</a>, 21 April).

Firefighting the immediate problem is essential, but consideration of any form of phased exit from lockdown without a large stockpile of PPE would be criminal.</p> <p>This country has a dynamic garment industry, and worldwide shortages cannot be blamed. The time required to assess the many companies that are coming forward with offers to help was mentioned at the ministerial briefing on Wednesday \u2013 it is far more urgent than that. Any company, not just those volunteering, that could adapt to the rapid manufacture of large quantities of PPE should be identified and their output requisitioned if necessary.</p> <p>Best practice regarding levels of protection should also be sought: a good place to start would be the Covid-19 hospital in Naples, where the use of effective PPE meant not a single member of the medical teams was infected at the height of the outbreak.<br><strong>Dr John O\u2019Driscoll</strong><br><em>Sale, Cheshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 My mother was an Oldham cotton weaver, my father a cotton spinner.

My mother\u2019s place of work kept going. I asked Mum what she wove, and she replied \u201cstuff for hospitals\u201d. The hospitals got what they needed, and the weavers got the work and wages. I would like to see a similar arrangement operating today. Hospitals would get a regular supply, from our own mills. There would be certainty, with no searching of world markets.

If Virgin Care ever does make a profit, we have committed to reinvest 100% of that back into the NHS.</p> <p>Hyde also fails to paint an accurate picture of the tax affairs of the Virgin companies, all of which pay taxes in the countries in which they operate. That includes the brand-owning business, which is based, and pays taxes, in the UK.</p> <p>Richard spends the vast majority of his time starting not-for-profit ventures and raising millions for charity through speeches and other charitable engagements. Since he gives 100% of any monies he earns from these activities to charity, it makes no difference for his personal tax purposes whether he is located in the UK or the British Virgin Islands.</p> <p>We were also saddened to see Hyde suggest that, if she were religious, she might think the fire on Necker Island and Hurricane Irma were some sort of punishment from God for Sir Richard Branson. Hurricane Irma devastated the BVI and further afield, and Sir Richard worked tirelessly to support the community and implement long-term projects to rebuild the region in the immediate aftermath. To use the hurricane in this context is a disservice to all those deeply affected by that natural disaster.<br><strong>Nicholas Fox</strong><br><em>Virgin Group</em></p> <p>\u2022 Is Marina Hyde being a little harsh on Richard Branson?

It was followed up by a letter of gratitude and a promise of 10% off my next trip.

  "<p>Rachel Riley, the presenter of Countdown, has won the first round in a high court libel claim over a tweet sent by a former senior aide to Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <p>Riley is suing Laura Murray over a message posted a short time after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/04/man-charged-over-alleged-attack-on-jeremy-corbyn\">the former Labour leader was hit by eggs</a> thrown by a Brexit supporter during a visit to Finsbury Park mosque on 3 March 2019.</p> <p>Shortly after the incident, the 34-year-old TV presenter tweeted a picture of an earlier tweet by Guardian columnist Owen Jones about an attack on former British National party leader Nick Griffin, in which Jones said: \u201cI think sound life advice is, if you don\u2019t want eggs thrown at you, don\u2019t be a Nazi.\u201d</p> <p>On 3 March, Riley replied, \u201cGood advice\u201d, with an emoji of a red rose and an egg. Later that day, Murray tweeted: \u201cToday Jeremy Corbyn went to his local mosque for Visit My Mosque Day, and was attacked by a Brexiteer. Rachel Riley tweets that Corbyn deserves to be violently attacked because he is a Nazi. This woman is as dangerous as she is stupid. Nobody should engage with her. Ever.\u201d</p> <p>Riley has described Murray\u2019s tweet as an \u201cappalling distortion of the truth\u201d and is now suing for damages. She says Murray\u2019s tweet contained \u201cdefamatory statements of fact\u201d about her. In her defence, Murray argued that the tweet was not defamatory and was a statement of her opinion.</p> <p>On Friday, following a preliminary hearing conducted by written submissions, Mr Justice Nicklin ruled that the meaning of Murray\u2019s tweet was that Riley \u201chad publicly stated in a tweet that he [Mr Corbyn] deserved to be violently attacked\u201d.</p> <p>The judge also ruled that the part of Murray\u2019s tweet which said Riley was \u201cas dangerous as she is stupid\u201d was an expression of opinion, which meant that Riley had \u201cshown herself to be a dangerous and stupid person who risked inciting unlawful violence\u201d.</p> <p>Nicklin said both of those parts of Murray\u2019s tweet are defamatory in common law. He rejected the contention, advanced by Murray\u2019s lawyers, that a reasonable reader of her tweet would understand the reference to Riley supposedly stating that Corbyn \u201cdeserved to be violently attacked\u201d to be an expression of opinion.</p> <p>Concluding, Mr Justice Nicklin said: \u201cAn imputation that a person had publicly supported a violent attack on someone is plainly defamatory at common law. It is conduct which would substantially affect, in an adverse manner, the attitude of other people towards the claimant or have a tendency so to do.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The Foreign Office\u2019s most senior civil servant has been forced to issue a second clarification within three days over oral evidence he gave to MPs earlier this week.</p> <p>Sir Simon McDonald said police were free to seek to prosecute overseas diplomats suspected of criminal offences in the UK, and cannot be directed by the Foreign Office that the diplomat has blanket immunity.</p> <p>His clarification overrode his previous implication that the police could not prosecute an overseas diplomat if told by the Foreign Office the individual has immunity.</p> <p>There have been suggestions the Northamptonshire police felt they were told by the Foreign Office it was not possible for the police to prosecute Ann Sacoolas, the wife of a US intelligence officer, after the car she was driving killed 19-year-old motorcyclist Harry Dunn last August. The instruction led the police to take no action to arrest Sacoolas, who left the country a fortnight later.</p> <p>The issue may prove important if the Dunn family are successful in their application for a judicial review into the Foreign Office\u2019s handling of the case, since one issue may prove to be the degree of coordination between the UK police and the Foreign Office.</p> <p>On Tuesday, before the foreign affairs select committee, McDonald implied the police had no discretion whether to prosecute once it had been informed by the Foreign Office she had immunity. \u201cThe police will always refer immunity matters as a matter of course,\u201d he told the committee.</p> <p> Foreign Office lawyers, after a few days of indecision in the immediate wake of the accident, decided Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity as the dependant of an agent working at the US spy base RAF Croughton.</p> <p>McDonald in his letter to the select committee also clarifies the extent of the contact between UK and state department lawyers prior to the UK concluding she had immunity.</p> <p>In his oral evidence, he said there had been conversations between government lawyers in Washington and London, a degree of contact criticised by lawyers acting for the family of Harry Dunn.</p> <p>But McDonald now says legal teams in Washington and London considered the issues separately. He said: \u201cThere were no conversations at all between the UK and US government lawyers dealing with this issue during the relevant period. The respective positions of the UK and the US were exchanged through diplomatic correspondence in the ordinary way\u201d</p> <p>Foreign Office lawyers came to the view that Sacoolas had immunity since although a treaty negotiated between the UK and the US waived immunity for US agents working at the base, the treaty was silent on whether the waiver applied to their dependants.</p> <p>McDonald himself described the conclusion that the dependants had waivers but the agent or diplomat did not as \u201capparently illogical\u201d, but argued if the treaty was silent on the dependant\u2019s status then the law as it existed before applies.</p> <p>On the degree of police latitude in prosecuting a diplomat, McDonald supplements his evidence, writing: \u201cThe FCO and the police work together closely on immunity issues, and, in that context, the police will refer questions about immunity to the FCO as a matter of course. The FCO is responsible for engaging with the sending state and for seeking waivers of immunity where necessary.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, all parties involved in these cases operate within the accepted framework of the operational independence of the police, it being for them to determine what steps to take in the investigation of criminal offences. All parties are also aware that while the FCO can provide assistance on questions of immunity, and in particular on relevant questions of fact, questions of law under the Vienna convention are ultimately for the courts (as indeed are all questions of law)\u201d.</p> <p>Earlier this week, McDonald in a separate letter to the committee had to reverse a claim made at the same committee session that it had been a decision by politicians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/uk-refusal-of-eu-ventilator-offer-was-political-decision\">to refuse to join a EU ventilator scheme</a>. His original claim created a political furore, but he later withdrew it.</p>",
  "<p>The Dutch government has announced measures including huge cuts to coal use, garden greening and limits on livestock herds as part of its plan to lower emissions to comply with a supreme court ruling.</p> <p>Climate litigation activists described the move as \u201can enormous win\u201d. The small non-profit Urgenda Foundation, which filed the initial legal challenge in 2013, said this and earlier compliance measures totalled about \u20ac3bn euros, which confirms the impact of the world\u2019s most successful climate lawsuit to date.</p> <p>Under the new package, coal-fired power stations will have to scale back or close completely , cattle and pig herds will be reduced, subsidies will be provided to home owners to use less concrete and more plants in their gardens, and industry will have to find alternatives for several polluting processes.</p> <p>\u201cThat is an enormous win,\u201d said Marjan Minnesma, the director of Urgenda, which has 15-staff and operates out of two former school classrooms. \u201cFor many people this will give hope that it is possible to use the law as a strategic instrument for change.\u201d</p> <p>After a seven-year legal battle, the supreme court in the Hague <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/20/dutch-supreme-court-upholds-landmark-ruling-demanding-climate-action\">ordered the government</a> in December to reduce emissions by 15 megatonnes in 2020. The judges accepted Urgenda\u2019s argument that climate change posed a dangerous threat to human rights and the Netherlands needed to accelerate its actions to meet its international commitment of a 25% cut compared with 1990.</p> <p>To comply, the government has adopted 30 of the proposals in Urgenda\u2019s \u201c54 Climate Solutions Plan\u201d, which was drawn up in collaboration with 800 civil society groups and other organisations.</p> <p>The headline change is a 75% reduction in capacity at the country\u2019s three coal-fired power stations, all of which have been opened in the past five years. The government is also reportedly in negotiations to close one of these plants.</p> <p>In addition, it will provide about \u20ac400m for household energy saving measures such as double glazing, \u20ac360m to compensate farmers for livestock reductions, and \u20ac30m for LED lighting in greenhouses.</p> <p>Along with earlier steps \u2013 including lower speed limits to control emissions of nitrogen dioxide, \u20ac2bn for rooftop solar and other forms of renewable energy, solar panels on all school rooftops, more sustainable forestry and changes in the use of concrete, the measures are expected to save 8 megatonnes of emissions this year and provide extra benefits in terms of air quality and wildlife habitat.</p> <p>Minnesma said this should be seen as a \u201cpromising start\u201d because the government is still about 4 megatonnes short of its obligations. She said the coronavirus lockdown should not be used as an excuse to backpedal.</p> <p>The package was presented to parliament on Friday afternoon. The government said the measures would provide an economic stimulus and also help to reduce<strong> </strong>nitrogen pollution, which has been the subject of other legal actions.</p> <p>MPs said the package should inspire activists across the world to pursue litigation against governments that drag their feet.</p> <p>\u201cWithout a doubt this should encourage climate lawsuits in other countries. It\u2019s a shining example,\u201d said Green party politician Tom van der Lee. \u201cThis package wouldn\u2019t be there without an order from the highest court. Without that verdict, the government would have chosen a slower trajectory.\u201d</p> <p>The environmental law charity ClientEarth said the result was unprecedented in Europe and testament to the impact of climate litigation, which is spreading around the world. \u201cThe Urgenda case should be considered a groundbreaking success, not just legally, but for driving real world action on climate change,\u201d Sophie Marjanac, a ClientEarth lawyer.</p> <p>The Dutch legal system\u2019s ease of access and political independence of judges helped to make the case possible. If Urgenda had lost, they would only have had to pay \u20ac18,000 rather than the government\u2019s extensive costs.</p> <p>The Urgenda case has been closely watched around the world. While climate activists have welcomed the outcome, they urge the Netherlands to raise ambition beyond 2020 compliance with the orders of the supreme court. \u201cThe Netherlands now needs to lay out a strategy to reach net zero by around the middle of this century,\u201d said Bob Ward, policy and communications director of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.</p>",

  "<p>Esteban Granero has some good news, a little light at the end of a long, dark tunnel in Spain, where the coronavirus crisis has left more than 21,000 people dead. \u201cThe situation is terrible,\u201d says the midfielder, a league title winner with Real Madrid, \u201cbut the curve is clearly downward now; we reached the peak on the fourth [of April] and now we\u2019re on the way down. Things shift daily but we think at the end of the month, early May, the number of cases will be very low and there will be room for optimism.\u201d</p> <p>Granero does not speak lightly. He has been watching the trends carefully. Not just watching them, in fact: he has been helping to map, measure and predict the number of those infected in Spain. The former Queens Park Rangers, Madrid and Real Sociedad midfielder, who has just moved from Espanyol to the Second Division B side Marbella on a mission to take them to <em>primera</em>, is the founder and chief executive of Olocip, an artificial intelligence company engaged in the fight against the virus.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/23/la-liga-plan-to-restart-season-daily-covid-19-tests-training-isolation\">Daily Covid-19 tests and biodegradable kit bags: La Liga's plan to restart season</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve built a model that estimates and predicts the number of cases and tracks the evolution of those numbers,\u201d he says. \u201cThat allows us to anticipate potential problems in the mobilisation of resources. It predicts, for example, which regions will need masks and respirators, enabling you to anticipate supply. The model can also simulate distancing measures, measuring how changes in the lockdown impact upon the curve, foreseeing trends and helping us prevent a second wave.\u201d</p> <p>All of which might sound like an unexpected activity for a footballer, but it started with the game. The advances that Granero and his team spent years working on are being applied to the pandemic, their findings available to health authorities. \u201cThroughout my career, I saw the information gathered, how it was analysed and used, and it was pretty deficient,\u201d he says. \u201cSome decisions were taken in an arbitrary way, and I thought there had to be a means of producing analyses that was not just descriptive but predictive.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a34fba79a819a77f1a5266ca38a0ef4ec4e6dc8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a34fba79a819a77f1a5266ca38a0ef4ec4e6dc8/0_162_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Esteban Granero in action for Espanyol against Leganes in December, before his move to Marbella.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Esteban Granero in action for Espanyol against Legan\u00e9s in December, before his move to Marbella.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Perez Meca/MB Media/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Granero, who began studying psychology at Complutense University in Madrid, contacted Pedro Larra\u00f1aga and Concha Bielza five years ago. Professors of AI at the Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica and \u201ctwo of the most important scientists in Europe\u201d according to Granero, they and he worked with a network of data analysts, doctors and scientists to fine-tune their models.</p> <p>\u201cThe principal error in descriptive analysis is that it doesn\u2019t respond to the question the club is actually asking,\u201d Granero says. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking at a player to sign, I\u2019m not so interested in what he did last year as asking: \u2018Look, if I sign this player, how will he work here, in my context?\u2019 And that answer can only be provided by artificial intelligence.</p> <p>\u201cPeople tend to think of AI as a kind of magic; it\u2019s not, it\u2019s analysis. It\u2019s not a rejection of intuitive, \u2018inside\u2019 football knowledge, either. Or machine over man. Quite the opposite. You need intuition, understanding, to even identify the variables to be measured. The role of the expert is primordial, defining the analysis you need.</p> <p>\u201cFor example, you might ask: \u2018How can we get <em>this</em> player in <em>this</em> area of the pitch and generate a chance in fewer than three passes?\u2019 You can measure that, analyse it, and generate statistics on a descriptive level but also measure that as a predictive variable, enabling you to identify players who can perform that role. Applying the data in a predictive manner is the big leap.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call football mechanised but everything you do is susceptible to being converted into data, although there are intangibles, chance. What we do is build the tools that strengthen an expert\u2019s ability: a sporting director, say, or a doctor preventing injuries. In the same way a mathematician uses a calculator, we provide the tool that facilitates the process. We always say that human and machine working together are much stronger than either on their own.</p> <p>\u201cUncertainty can never be zero. These are models of probability, not deterministic. It\u2019s not a crystal ball. What it can tell you scientifically is that there is a certain type of player in the third division in Holland, say, that if you sign him there\u2019s a 95% chance he will score between 12 and 15 goals.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"950ae184bfcb4123c211156e62feb9a7bdb7f7da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/950ae184bfcb4123c211156e62feb9a7bdb7f7da/0_94_3324_2170/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Esteban Granero playing for QPR against Chelsea 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"653\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Esteban Granero playing for QPR against Chelsea 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Asked how often the model is right, Granero replies: \u201cThe normal thing is for it to get it right. Lots, lots, lots of players finish with the numbers predicted. At most you\u2019re talking one or two off. The prediction models are tested, validated, held against reality. It\u2019s not an easy process: some time ago these models didn\u2019t exist and we have worked at this, getting it right. When you see it works, the results are powerful.

  "<p>The UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/competition-commission\">competition watchdog</a> will next week set out measures to tackle concerns about refunds and cancellations in the travel industry after a surge in complaints.</p> \n<p>On Friday, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said in the week ending 19 April, four in five complaints received by its coronavirus taskforce related to refunds and cancellations.</p> \n<p>The government-backed body said it was \u201cparticularly concerned\u201d about firms refusing refunds, charging high administration or cancellation fees and pressuring consumers into accepting vouchers instead of cash refunds.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4db28889-c914-4b4c-b6ad-4ee0194d1882\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>My flight to Europe is cancelled.

All flights on EU carriers within, or into the EU, and all flights leaving from an EU airport, are protected by the EU\u2019s \u201cdenied boarding\u201d rules, which require a full refund in seven days when flights are cancelled.</p>\n    <p>The problem for consumers is that enforcing these rights is proving very difficult.

The transition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/30/extend-brexit-transition-by-years-over-coronavirus-uk-told\">can be extended</a> by up to one or two years by mutual agreement.</p> \n<p>Frost later tweeted: \u201cIf we are to make progress now, we need to focus on agreeing a future relationship that has a comprehensive [free trade agreement] at its core, like those the EU has agreed elsewhere. We support high standards. But there is no need for novel and unprecedented \u2018level playing field\u2019 rules, for example tying us to EU laws, or a role for the EU court. What the EU proposes is unlike anything agreed in other such FTAs and we will not agree to it here.</p> \n<p>\u201cFinally, we are ready to work to agree a fisheries agreement which reflects our rights under international law to control our own waters, &amp; provides for annual negotiations over access based on scientific principles.

In any case, the government is finished.\u201d</p> <p>The immediate trigger for Moro\u2019s resignation was reportedly Bolsonaro\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-politics/bolsonaro-fires-head-of-brazils-federal-police-amid-political-spat-idUSKCN2261KW?il=0\">decision to remove</a> one of the minister\u2019s closest associates, Maur\u00edcio<em> </em>Valeixo, from his job as head of the federal police.</p> <p>Since reports of Valeixo\u2019s impending firing emerged on Thursday, Brazilian newspapers have filled with speculation about why Bolsonaro would be so keen to remove him.</p> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.correiobraziliense.com.br/vicente/pf-esta-proxima-de-pegar-carlos-bolsonaro-por-fake-news/\">A report</a> in one major newspaper, the Correio Braziliense, claimed Bolsonaro\u2019s discomfort stemmed from the fact that a federal police investigation into the dissemination of fake news and promotion of anti-democracy protests was closing in on a highly sensitive target: the president\u2019s own son, Carlos Bolsonaro.</p> <p>Carlos Bolsonaro denied those claims <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CarlosBolsonaro/status/1253430667284606977?s=20\">in a pair of offensive tweets</a> aimed at the broadsheet.</p> <p>\u201cYou scum never stop lying,\u201d one said.

  "<p>A British academic whose new book is about why women are blamed for crimes committed against them has been subjected to thousands of coordinated attacks from alt-right trolls over the last week, culminating in her personal computer being hacked.</p> <p>Dr Jessica Taylor, a senior lecturer in forensic and criminal psychology, is due to publish her exploration of victim blaming, <a href=\"https://victimfocus-resources.com/products/why-women-are-blamed-for-everything-exploring-victim-blaming-of-women-subjected-to-violence-and-trauma-by-dr-jessica-taylor-special-edition-hardback-signed-by-author\">Why Women are Blamed for Everything</a>, on 27 April. Looking into what causes society to blame women who have been abused, raped, trafficked, assaulted or harassed by men, the book has drawn increasing publicity, including <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCWomansHour/status/1253254672649015302\">an appearance on Woman\u2019s Hour</a>.</p> <p>But since 17 April, Taylor has been targeted by what she describes as a \u201cgroup of organised trolls\u201d who align themselves with the \u201calt-right\u201d, men\u2019s rights activists, incel (involuntary celibates) and Mgtow (men going their own way) movements, who have posted thousands of messages on her public Facebook page, including rape and death threats. On 21 April, Taylor contacted police when the screen on her laptop was remotely accessed. The investigation is ongoing.</p> <p>\u201cThey had total control of my keyboard and mouse. I tried to stop them \u2026 after about 30 seconds of this, I realised how serious it was and I shut my laptop down and ran inside to turn my wifi off and shut all other devices down,\u201d Taylor told the Guardian on Friday.</p> <p>For five days, she was receiving 100 comments every few minutes, \u201ceverything from telling me to die, kill myself, messages saying \u2018I will rape you\u2019, messages saying I am not a real psychologist or PhD, that I\u2019m fat, ugly, disgusting, dyke, ugly lesbian, barren, infertile, will die alone, that my parents hate me etc \u2026 When we started banning and blocking, they really ramped it up and it became violent and abusive.\u201d</p> <p>By Friday, more than 2,000 accounts had been blocked from her Facebook page.</p> <p>Taylor is the founder of VictimFocus, an international research, teaching and consultancy organisation which aims to challenge the victim blaming of women subjected to violence and abuse. Her book is based on her doctoral research and on her 10 years of practice with women and girls, including interviews with women who were blamed for being raped, and the professionals who supported them.</p> <p>\u201cI knew the book needed to be written \u2013 but I didn\u2019t know it needed to be written this badly. The targeted attacks from men in the last week have been appalling. I will always centre women in my work and I will keep making misogynists uncomfortable. Abuse and trolling is scary and it\u2019s exhausting, but it\u2019s never going to get me to a point where I say, \u2018I will just stop talking about the abuse of women and girls,\u2019\u201d said Taylor.</p> <p>She said the book was \u201cwritten for every single woman and girl who has been told that she had to do something differently, change something about herself or make her life smaller so she isn\u2019t subjected to male violence. I\u2019ve had enough and millions of other women have had enough, too \u2026 [This book] has made a lot of men angry. You have to ask why that is. What are they frightened of?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Ministers were warned last year the UK must have a robust plan to deal with a pandemic virus and its potentially catastrophic social and economic consequences in a confidential Cabinet Office briefing leaked to the Guardian.</p> \n<p>The detailed document warned that even a mild pandemic could cost tens of thousands of lives, and set out the must-have \u201ccapability requirements\u201d to mitigate the risks to the country, as well as the potential damage of not doing so.</p> \n<p>It comes as the UK\u2019s hospital death toll from coronavirus heads towards 20,000. Less than a month ago, the medical director at NHS England, Prof Stephen Powis, said the country would \u201chave done very well\u201d to stay below this grim milestone.</p> \n<p>Marked \u201cofficial, sensitive\u201d, the 2019 National Security Risk Assessment (NSRA) was signed off by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, as well as a senior national security adviser to the prime minister whom the Guardian has been asked not to name.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"NSRA doc\"> \n <iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" title=\"Uknsra Selected Pages Redacted\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/457900683/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;access_key=key-99TDyoyNM3ontPRHXRxL\" data-auto-height=\"true\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.7068965517241379\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The recommendations within it included the need to stockpile PPE (personal protective equipment), organise advanced purchase agreements for other essential kit, establish procedures for disease surveillance and contact tracing, and draw up plans to manage a surge in excess deaths.</p> \n<p>Having plans for helping British nationals abroad and repatriating them to the UK was also flagged as a priority.</p> \n<p>All of these areas have come under relentless scrutiny since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, with the government accused of being too slow to react to the crisis. It is now under sustained pressure to provide answers about what was done nationally and locally to provide the support that planners have long called for, amid growing fears ministers were \u201ccaught out\u201d by the crisis and have been playing catchup ever since.</p> \n<p>The Cabinet Office document, which runs to more than 600 pages, not only analysed the risk of a viral flu pandemic but also specifically addressed the potential for a coronavirus outbreak (the earlier Sars and Mers were both coronaviruses), though it regarded this as potentially much less damaging. In reality, the UK is dealing with a hybrid of the two, raising further questions about whether ministers were quick enough to recognise the dangers and were able to rely on whatever preparations were already in place.</p> \n<p>Drawing on previous security assessments and health risk registers, the document implicitly warned ministers they could not afford to be complacent. \u201cA novel pandemic virus could be both highly transmissible and highly virulent,\u201d it said. \u201cTherefore, pandemics significantly more serious than the reasonable worst case \u2026 are possible.\u201d</p> \n<p>The government declined to provide specific details of the preparations that had been made prior to the pandemic, but said it would be unfair to say they were \u201cstarting from scratch\u201d, pointing to planning exercises carried out in recent years.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is an unprecedented global pandemic and we have taken the right steps at the right time to combat it, guided at all times by the best scientific advice,\u201d a government spokesman said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe government has been proactive in implementing lessons learned around pandemic preparedness. This includes being ready with legislative proposals that could rapidly be tailored to what became the Coronavirus Act, plans to strengthen excess death planning, planning for recruitment and deployment of retired staff and volunteers, and guidance for stakeholders and sectors across government.\u201d</p> \n<p>But one source with knowledge of the Cabinet Office document said the UK had not properly focused on the pandemic threat, and had been caught flat-footed.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe really frustrating thing is that there were plans. But over the last few years emergency planning has been focused on political drivers, like Brexit and flooding.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere was a national plan for dealing with a pandemic that should have been implemented. But who took control of that? And who was responsible for making sure that plans were being made at a local level? The truth is, I am not sure anyone was doing this.\u201d</p> \n<p>The source added: \u201cWe have been paying for a third-party fire and theft insurance for a pandemic, not a comprehensive one. We have been caught out.\u201d</p> \n<p>The shadow Cabinet Office minister, Rachel Reeves, said the revelations were \u201calarming \u2026 and raised serious questions about the government\u2019s planning and preparedness for a coronavirus-style pandemic\u201d.</p> \n<p>She demanded her opposite number, Michael Gove, give a statement to parliament on Monday to explain \u201cwhether this report was read and what actions were taken\u201d.</p> \n<p>The NSRA sets out a series of potential reasonable worst case scenarios (RWCS) for the spread of a flu-like viral pandemic, which emergency planning experts regard as the benchmark for its preparedness in the current crisis.</p> \n<p>It also included predictions that offer insights into how planners believe a crisis like this current emergency might evolve.</p> \n<p>The document said:</p> \n<p>\u2022 A pandemic would play out in up to \u201cthree waves\u201d, with each wave expected to last 15 weeks \u2026 \u201cwith the peak weeks occurring at weeks 6 and 7 in each wave\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u2022 50% of the population would be infected and experience symptoms of pandemic influenza during the one or more waves.

  "<p>Careful analysis of the National Security Risk Assessment document illustrates how the Covid-19 pandemic represents a hybrid of two of the major threats to the UK anticipated by the British government.</p> <p>The first, an influenza-type disease pandemic, predicts waves of a novel flu virus striking several months apart. This type of threat represents the basis of the UK government\u2019s blueprint for how it would respond to a pandemic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"NSRA document\">  <iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" title=\"Uknsra Selected Pages Redacted\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/457900683/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&access_key=key-99TDyoyNM3ontPRHXRxL\" data-auto-height=\"true\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.7068965517241379\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Britain\u2019s preparations for a flu pandemic include stockpiles of millions of doses of antivirals, including the drugs Tamiflu and Relenza, as well as a digital distribution system called the National Flu Pandemic Service that would be deployed to coordinate the distribution of antivirals to people who were symptomatic.</p> <p><a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/213717/dh_131040.pdf\">Plans published in 2011</a> detail stocks of pre-specific vaccine that could be administered to healthcare workers in parallel alongside antivirals, so as to maintain the UK\u2019s health workforce.</p> <p>However, these preparations are contingent on the pandemic being a variation of influenza. Covid-19 is a coronavirus, not a strain of influenza, making some of those preparations less useful.</p> <p>The document also contains a separate chapter anticipating non-flu-based \u201cemerging infectious diseases\u201d, even specifically citing the risk of a novel coronavirus arriving in the UK.</p> <p>The risk model assumes that such a disease would be comparable to Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) or Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome), outbreaks of which afflicted south-east Asia and the Middle East in recent years. Those viruses have case fatality rates of between 33% and 50%, making them far more lethal than Covid-19.</p> <p>In some respects, the UK\u2019s response necessarily has to begin from scratch because of the novel nature of the disease: treatments, vaccines and even the mode of transmission all have to be identified.</p> <p>But the building blocks of responding to a pandemic are roughly the same, a source said: \u201cWe are not moving from a standing start. We should be building out from what we know \u2013 PPE [personal protective equipment], community disruption, supply line difficulties and public anxiety.</p> <p>\u201cPandemic flu gives us the modelling to start from. It\u2019s about building on what you have. What we had at the beginning had been depleted over the years and no one challenged the changes because [the feeling was] something like this would never happen.\u201d</p> <p>Containing any novel disease outbreak in the UK would require intensive measures to detect and limit its spread, the document states. \u201cSustained human-to-human transmission in emerging airborne diseases is possible,\u201d it reads, \u201cwhich is why infection control procedures are critical to the mitigation of this risk.\u201d</p> <p>The impacts of an emerging infectious disease anticipated by the risk assessment are vastly less severe than the havoc Covid-19 has wrought. A reasonable worst case scenario included 200 fatalities and an economic cost of \u00a37.5bn, chiefly as a result of a drop in tourism.</p> <p>This is, again, largely because the prediction is modelled upon Sars and Mers, which never achieved the same level of community transmission as Covid-19 has.</p> <p>The coronavirus pandemic\u2019s damage has instead been much more comparable to what the document anticipates for a flu pandemic: potentially hundreds of thousands of fatalities, as well as a total economic cost of over \u00a32tn as a result of widespread and lasting disruption.</p> <p>Alarmingly, the document notes that, although unpredictable, \u201cthe emergence of new infectious diseases \u2026 appears to have become more frequent\u201d, possibly as a result of worsening global heating. \u201cClimate change may result in conditions that may make the UK more hospitable for establishment of insect vectors of diseases currently not endemic in the country,\u201d it warns.</p>",
  "<p>The 2019 National Security Risk Assessment (NSRA) is a comprehensive planning document that sets out the risks facing the UK \u2013 and what is needed to prepare for them.</p> <p>It was signed off by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser. Over 600 pages, it runs through dozens of potential threats \u2013 but an \u201cinfluenza-type pandemic\u201d is at the top of this worry list, as it has been for years. Here are some selected extracts\u2026</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"NSRA document\">  <iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" title=\"Uknsra Selected Pages Redacted\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/457900683/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&access_key=key-99TDyoyNM3ontPRHXRxL\" data-auto-height=\"true\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.7068965517241379\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Overview</h2> <p>Up to 50% of the UK population may fall ill, with up to 20% of people off work during the peak weeks, causing a significant impact on business continuity. Critical national infrastructure may also be affected during peak periods. There would be a huge surge in demand for health and social care services.</p> <p>Besides very severe levels of stress on the NHS, the level of excess deaths would stretch capacity within organisations involved in the management of deaths. This would be felt on a national scale, with local capacity likely to start to be overwhelmed during the peak of the pandemic. While not explicitly stated in every case, an influenza- type pandemic would probably compound the effects of the vast majority of risks in the NSRA, as all sectors would experience staffing pressures.</p> <h2>Response capability requirements</h2> <p>Procedures related to disease surveillance and early detection, plus any associated infrastructure, should be in place. Robust and tested arrangements for rapid scientific and clinical advice should similarly be set up.</p> <p>Local and national plans for management of excess deaths resulting from any mass casualty event should be present.</p> <p>Local and national plans to deal with a surge in demand for health and social care services need to be accounted for.</p> <p>There needs to be stockpiles of countermeasures and advanced purchase arrangements for those that cannot be acquired in advance.</p> <p>Communication plans to encourage social distancing and good hygiene should be active. Sector resilience plans, including planning for absence of key workers, need enforcing.</p> <h2>Multiple waves</h2> <p>It is predicted that an influenza pandemic would come in multiple waves.</p> <p>This means that recovery from one wave could be hampered by the arrival of a subsequent wave. Even after the end of a pandemic, it is likely that it would take months, or even years, for health and social care services to recover, although an exact timescale cannot be predicted. It is likely the economic impact would be felt for years.</p> <p>The reasonable worst case scenario (RWCS) assumes that the pandemic will come in multiple waves (up to three), each approximately 15 weeks long.</p> <p>For example, in the RWCS, 9,840,000 people would require assessment by health services (30% of those who are symptomatic), of which 1,312,000 people would require hospital treatment and 328,000 the highest level of critical care. Using the estimated UK population for 2016, this RWCS could result in 820,000 fatalities.</p> <p>Besides very severe levels of stress on the NHS, the level of excess deaths would stretch capacity within organisations involved in the management of deaths, including coroners and burial services. This would be felt on a national scale, with local capacity likely to be overwhelmed during the peak of the pandemic.</p> <p>\u2022 The pandemic would present in one or more waves. Each wave is expected to lasting 15 weeks, with the peak weeks occurring at weeks six and seven in each wave.</p> <p>\u2022 Ffity per cent of the population would be infected and experience symptoms of pandemic influenza during the one or more waves. The actual number of people infected would be higher than this, as there would be a number of asymptomatic cases.</p> <p>\u2022 A case fatality ratio of 2.5%, meaning 2.5% of those with symptoms could die as a result of the influenza virus. Four per cent of symptomatic patients would require hospital care, 25% of whom are expected to need the highest level of critical care (level three).</p> <p>\u2022 Peak illness rates of about 10-12% (measured in new clinical cases per week as a proportion of the population) are expected in each of the weeks in the peak fortnight (weeks six and seven).</p> <p>\u2022 Workplace absence rates for illness will be reaching 17-20% in the peak weeks.</p> <h2>On vaccines</h2> <p>There are no known markers that herald the start of a new pandemic. Based on most current vaccine technologies, it is likely to take at least four to six months after a novel virus has been identified and isolated for an effective pandemic influenza vaccine to become available from manufacturers in large quantity.</p> <p>This means that the first pandemic wave will not be vaccine-preventable; it will not be possible to contain a novel pandemic virus in its country of origin or on arrival in the UK.</p> <p>The expectation must be that the virus will spread rapidly to the UK (a major global transport hub) and that any local measures taken to disrupt or reduce the spread are likely to have very limited or partial success at national level and cannot be relied on as a way to \u201cbuy time\u201d.</p> <p>The UK has an advanced purchase agreement for pandemic vaccine, which can be triggered in response to a pandemic threat. Even after the end of the pandemic it is likely that it would take months, or even years, for the health and social care services to recover, although an exact timescale cannot be predicted<strong>.</strong></p> <h2>On deaths \u2013 moderate viral pandemic</h2> <p>This variation models a moderate pandemic, based on the 1957 and 1968 pandemics.</p> <p>The annual likelihood of a pandemic with the characteristics described below is 2%.</p> <p>The specific assumptions of this scenario are listed below.</p> <ul> <li><p>About 32% (21,320,000) of the population would be infected and experience symptoms of pandemic influenza.</p></li> <li><p>A case fatality ratio of 0.2%, resulting in 65,600 deaths.</p></li> <li><p>Of symptomatic patients, 0.55% (117,260) would require hospital care, 25% (29,315) of whom would be expected to require the highest level of critical care (level three).</p></li> <li><p>Peak illness rates of about 6.5-8% (measured in new clinical cases per week as a proportion of the population) would be expected in each of the weeks in the peak fortnight (weeks six and seven). This scenario would still have a significant impact on health and social care systems as well as death management systems.</p></li> </ul> <p>There would also be higher than usual absence from work.</p> <h2>On lockdown</h2> <p>Public health measures such as school closures and social distancing may be partially successful in delaying the peak of a pandemic wave by a few weeks at most, and might reduce the overall size of a pandemic wave.</p> <p>However these measures are disruptive, with known secondary consequences (eg closing schools would reduce the availability of healthcare workers), and the limited evidence available suggests that such measures have maximum effect when implemented early and simultaneously.</p> <p>For the RWCS, it is assumed that schools have not been closed. Global travel, particularly commercial airlines, will have an impact on the spread of the disease. Although the strain was mild, the pandemic in 2009 showed that a rapid global spread was possible. However, evidence suggests that border control measures would be largely ineffective, because the duration of most international passenger flights is considerably shorter than the incubation period of the illness.</p> <h2>On behavioural impact/public outrage</h2> <p>The public outrage would likely be determined by the preparations and response undertaken by the government. Poor government handling of the situation would exacerbate the level of outrage significantly. There would be significant and widespread public outrage directed at the authorities given the very high numbers of fatalities and casualties within vulnerable groups. There would also be significant anger if vaccines, antivirals or other countermeasures were not perceived to be effective, evenly distributed or available as soon as practically possible, including when compared with other countries. The performance of the health and care system is likely to contribute to the public outrage, especially if provision of the remaining services is seen as unevenly distributed.

I\u2019ve often thought that it\u2019s like why we\u2019re so obsessed with crime dramas. It\u2019s because we don\u2019t have guns. If you go round shooting everybody, you\u2019re easy to catch. Without guns, the elaboration of the crime mystery is a lot more engaging. It\u2019s all done with a candlestick in the library or getting shoved off a train.

  "<p>With coronavirus making going to the cinema, a gig or the theatre a distant memory, there is one area of culture that is more accessible than ever: television. Live viewing has soared by 17% since the lockdown began, with the BBC and Channel 4 reporting huge increases in ratings. In March, ITV recorded its highest ever numbers for an entertainment show, when 11 million tuned into Ant and Dec\u2019s first Saturday Night Takeaway without a studio audience.</p> <p>But while most people are tuning into more shows than ever, millions around the world are still struggling to access them \u2013 including those with visual impairments. This frustration is felt by many, not least blind viewers in Wales, who were reported in February to be <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-51481740\">feeling like \u201csecond-class citizens\u201d</a> over the lack of audio-described original programming in the country.</p> <p>Robert Kingett is a Chicago-based journalist who has been blind since childhood due to retinopathy of prematurity. As well as consuming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/19/apocalypse-thrillers-and-afrofuturistic-epics-2019s-best-dramatic-podcasts\">fiction podcasts</a> and audiobooks, he is an avid TV-watcher. However, the audio description he relies on to fully understand shows is often frustratingly irregular,<strong> </strong>depending on the channel or the streaming service. \u201cVery little gets reported on in terms of the state and history of these accessibility matters,\u201d he says, despite the fact that they could have benefits for sighted audiences, too. \u201cYou can listen to a movie while driving. You can listen to a movie at the gym or when you have eye fatigue, or if you don\u2019t like reading subtitles.\u201d</p> <p>Sonali Rai is the audio description manager<strong> </strong>at the Royal National Institute of Blind People. She outlines how awareness has improved over the past decade. \u201cAfter an RNIB campaign in 2010, BBC, Channel 4, Sky and ITV made a public commitment to broadcast a minimum of 20% of their programming with audio description, with the others still required to do at least 10%,\u201d she explains. \u201cHowever, if you look at the latest <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/research-and-data/multi-sector-research/accessibility-research/television-access-services-report-jan-jul-2019\">Ofcom access services report</a>, most broadcasters seem to be achieving more than the legal requirement.\u201d</p> <p>Despite this, she says that online catchup and streaming services need to make serious improvements. \u201cSome are performing really well, but most are still trying to find a way to standardise the delivery of the audio-description tracks on their apps across different platforms. We would like to see content providers consider accessibility when they start designing their services, so they are not trying to retrofit it later.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30704e2670e9b48967310ad8e0816c5c609d1e7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30704e2670e9b48967310ad8e0816c5c609d1e7e/0_0_1700_1020/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Channel 4\u2019s First Dates, which Craig Reekie has to get his girlfriend to relay to him.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Channel 4\u2019s First Dates, which Craig Reekie has to get his girlfriend to relay to him.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ryan Mcnamara/CHANNEL 4 PICTURE PUBLICITY</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Take Netflix, for example. The streaming giant offers more than 500 audio-described series and films \u2013 including original content such as House of Cards \u2013 although it can often seem that there is<strong> </strong>no consistency to its approach, as became clear when the fifth series of Black Mirror was released. \u201cWhen it dropped, there was no audio description,\u201d says Kingett. \u201cThere are no regulations that say streaming companies have to be accessible \u2013 there\u2019s no standard, so things are nowhere near as organised or even reliable.\u201d</p> <p>It is not just providing audio description that is the issue, however. Often the hardware itself can prove prohibitive. Despite devices such as the latest Sky remote control, which allows for full voice control, there are still limitations, such as unreadable electronic programme guides. One deep frustration is that the level of care and attention given to the technology varies wildly between streaming services.<strong> </strong>Kingett speaks highly of Microsoft and Apple\u2019s accessibility policies, but they are exceptions rather than the rule. \u201cApple made its entire Apple TV+ platform accessible \u2013 and no other company has audio description in multiple languages.\u201d</p> <p>Craig Reekie, 34, lives in Glasgow. He started to lose his sight a few years ago and finds voice remotes particularly beneficial. \u201cWith Amazon Prime Video [unlike many other services], you can adjust the subtitles so they\u2019re really large or in inverted colours,\u201d he says.</p> <p>For Reekie, there is a catalogue of seemingly small things that could be solved with even cursory attention. Audio description has improved, he says, but it is still laughably spotty. \u201cI have to ask my girlfriend what happened in the epilogue on First Dates, when there could be a voiceover.\u201d For many, it can also be an alienating experience, and means being excluded from the everyday cultural conversations that form the backdrop to our lives. \u201cI also think blind people are missing out on so many foreign films or TV shows that could easily be dubbed,\u201d he adds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e303e4e120d5798f2105066cc2860c8fd9cafdd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e303e4e120d5798f2105066cc2860c8fd9cafdd4/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marvel\u2019s Daredevil, which was originally released without audio description.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marvel\u2019s Daredevil, which was originally released without audio description.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Harbron/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The greatest irony Kingett has encountered was with Daredevil, the Netflix <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/apr/10/daredevil-tv-emo-superhero\">show about the blind Marvel superhero</a>, which was released without audio description. There was also some confusion around the first season of the CW\u2019s 2019 dramedy In the Dark, in which the blind lead character is played by the sighted actor Perry Mattfeld. The show\u2019s network is not mandated to provide audio description, which led to viewers taking to Twitter wondering if the show would be accessible at all, despite its visually impaired characters. In the end, it was, although some asked why accessibility measures had been slipped in almost as an afterthought.</p> <p>On-screen representation is one thing, but it is not just inadequate hardware or poor audio description that cause difficulties for the partially sighted viewer. The past few years have witnessed the rise of the silent episode. Shows as diverse as BoJack Horseman and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/mr-robot\">Mr Robot</a> have made use of silence as a means of pushing TV boundaries, even if it presents a new barrier for visually impaired viewers. Audio description is a more ambiguous benefit in this instance, even if it were to be attempted. Would audio description applied to these episodes render them more audiobook than TV? Are more inventive approaches needed when the content is more experimental?</p> <p>Perhaps one of the answers is for programme-makers to start considering visual accessibility as a question of form, as well as presentation. Kingett described Apple TV+\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/28/see-review-jason-momoa-a-lethal-sensual-saga-apple-tv\">recent extinction parable, See</a>, as that rarest of things \u2013 and hopefully a portent of a more accessible future \u2013 a show that gives the sighted a taste of what it feels like not to be the priority.</p> <p>This is unlike the less technically ambitious Daredevil or In the Dark, which, despite their blind protagonists, don\u2019t go as far as they might have. See takes it that bit further, with its use of blind actors and the hiring of a \u201cblind consultant\u201d, Joe Strechay, as well as the inclusion of a host of disabled actors and crew. The on-screen characters use braille and there is crystal-clear use of audio description<strong>. </strong>\u201cFor once, it\u2019s the sighted population who need the world-building so they can put things together, but we get the gist of things right away,\u201d says Kingett. \u201cI love how blind people just live, love, kill and thrive in this world without adapting to it.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Interesting developments in America\u2019s elect-your-id experiment, as the shining city upon a hill runs up against that age-old political question: <em><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quis_custodiet_ipsos_custodes%3F\">Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?</a> </em>Which is Latin for \u201cwho lung-bleaches the lung bleachers?\u201d</p> \n<p>The inquiry arises after Thursday\u2019s White House press conference, which saw Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/trump-coronavirus-treatment-disinfectant\">offer his latest symposium</a> on how to kill a country. \u201cI see the disinfectant where it knocks [the virus] out in a minute,\u201d he gibbered, live on national television. \u201cOne minute!

You\u2019re asking a man who got to the Oval Office by going viral to disavow a virus. It\u2019s not very surprising that Trump can\u2019t bring himself to. You have to think he recognises something of a kindred spirit in the disease, which is indifferent to all human suffering, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/23/britain-ignorant-health-inequalities-coronavirus-black-people-dying\">impacts disproportionately on ethnic minorities</a> and is horrifyingly resistant to therapy.</p> \n<p>In terms of behavioural science, then, perhaps the best way to encourage Trump to defeat the virus would be to make him professionally jealous of it. At present he just regards it as a supporting cast member, occupying the Apprentice boardroom-sidekick chair once held by that other disease particle, <a href=\"https://www.eonline.com/uk/news/922284/donald-trump-jr-s-conflicted-world-how-his-parents-divorce-drama-and-his-relationship-with-dad-shaped-his-life\">Don Jr</a>. Or as the president put it this week in reference to his nightly press conferences that should ideally be guiding Americans on how not to die: \u201cI\u2019ve had great \u2018ratings\u2019 my whole life, there\u2019s nothing unusual about that for me. The White House News Conference ratings are \u2018through the roof\u2019 (Monday Night Football, Bachelor Finale) \u2026\u201d Congratulations to the star, showrunner and executive producer for having the vision to deliver this thing. Then again, shows with high body counts have always rated highly on US TV.</p> \n<p>Back on our own shores, meanwhile, the one useful moment in the Trump press conference was the bit where he imparted some \u2013 any \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/24/boris-johnson-sounds-incredible-ready-to-go-says-donald-trump\">information about Boris Johnson</a>, who remains off games. As you may recall, Britain has not had a working prime minister for some weeks now, in a moment of maximum crisis. But there is a sense \u2013 fostered by some of the most obnoxious people on Earth \u2013 that it would somehow be uncouth to dwell on how or even if decisions are being made. Instead, we are led by a cabinet <a href=\"https://slate.com/human-interest/2014/04/the-rat-king-or-roi-de-rats-is-a-very-creepy-conjoined-creature.html\">rat king</a>, with Dominic Raab\u2019s tail entwined with those of Matt Hancock, Michael Gove and Rishi Sunak. Eventually one of them \u2013 probably Sunak \u2013 will manage to bite off their own appendage to set themselves free. For now, the factions nip at each other off the record \u2013 and sometimes, at Johnson. \u201cThe prime minister is in a funny place,\u201d ran <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11443302/boris-frightened-coronavirus-hit-hard/\">one kindly monstering</a> a few days ago. \u201cI think he\u2019s quite frightened.\u201d I bet you do.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/24/uk-coronavirus-live-warning-mass-vaccinations-covid-19-latest-updates\">UK coronavirus live: officials apologise after key workers denied tests on day one of Hancock scheme</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The one entity everyone wants you to think is in charge, though, is The Science.

The ministers do not, in fact, all work for \u201cThe Science\u201d, the most suspiciously shadowy overlord since <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/14/entertainment/usual-suspects-movie-keyser-soze-feat/index.html\">Keyser S\u00f6ze</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Science\u201d is not some monolithic stone tablet that gets handed to Raab to read out to the masses \u2013 and all scientists themselves know this.

But now, through suspicious overuse to the exclusion of all other considerations, it has become troubling. Whenever some politician standing next to him says it these days, my overactive imagination fancies it sees a flicker behind the eyes of Chris Whitty. Is he realising that they are fitting him up to be the guy who needs at least 36 changes of shirt for the inevitable public inquiry? This week, some scientists advising the government <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexwickham/coronavirus-uk-scientists-human-shields\">told Buzzfeed</a> they feared they will be used by ministers as \u201chuman shields\u201d at such an event.</p> \n<p>Will they? You certainly wouldn\u2019t rule out Dominic Cummings\u2019s Downing Street believing they\u2019ve alighted on the perfect way to insulate themselves from blame \u2013 using scientists as a prophylactic.

  "<p><strong>I have a fear of confrontation</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>Recently, this destroyed my relationship with my best friend,</strong> <strong>after I slept with her ex.</strong> <strong>I did not tell her for several months, and developed my own twisted logic that I was somehow</strong> <strong>protecting</strong> <strong>her from the painful truth. When I did tell her, she made me realise </strong><strong>my</strong> <strong>refusal to tell the truth had hurt her more than the action itself.</strong></p> <p><strong>It\u2019s been a year, and</strong> <strong>I haven\u2019t spoken to her or her ex (who was also my friend). My</strong> <strong>way of dealing with the situation was to suppress</strong> <strong>thinking about it for months and continue with my life. However, partly owing to my relationship with my new partner (who is highly emotionally intelligent), I have started to reflect</strong> <strong>on the situation.</strong> <strong>I know I have to recognise my responsibility to myself and others, and become an active, not passive, force in</strong> <strong>my relationships. I</strong> <strong>hate the idea of ruining </strong><strong>that with my new partner, which is one of the best relationships I have</strong> <strong>had.</strong></p> <p><strong>This brings me to my main issue</strong><strong>. I live with the fear that my best friend will want</strong> <strong>another confrontation as part of her</strong> <strong>way of</strong> <strong>moving on. I am scared of bumping into her in my home town, or having to respond if she messages me</strong><strong>. I am conflicted over the fact that</strong> <strong>perhaps I owe it to her to instigate</strong> <strong>a meeting</strong><strong>.</strong> <strong>But I am scared that I will talk too much about myself, not listen well enough,</strong> <strong>or fail to offer anything new</strong><strong>, making her feel</strong> <strong>disappointed</strong> <strong>for even bothering with me. What can I do?</strong></p> <p>There\u2019s a lot of living in your head going on. Your friend hasn\u2019t made contact with you, and if she did, you are imagining that she wants confrontation. Often when people fear confrontation, it can be traced back to something that happened earlier in life, but it may not be as simple as that, as psychotherapist Lucy Beresford (<a href=\"https://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/\" title=\"\">psychotherapy.org.uk</a>) helped me understand.</p> <p>\u201cI did wonder if your idea of not wanting to have another conversation was less about fear of confrontation and more a masking of a deeper desire to always be in control,\u201d Beresford explained. She went on to say that the way you conducted the affair with your friend\u2019s ex, and then didn\u2019t tell her, was also about \u201ccontrolling the situation\u201d. This can stem from a fear of angering others and wanting to be liked.</p> <p>This is really worth exploring: think about your interactions with people, and which of these you deem to be successful and which aren\u2019t, and what the difference between them is. What is it about your new partner that has allowed you to learn more about yourself? You may find that, actually, you can talk in a \u201cconfronting\u201d way with some people and not with others; the reason for this may be telling. It may be down to the combination of personalities rather than just yours.</p> <p>Talking generally about fear of confrontation, Beresford said it \u201coften goes back to childhood, and is a fear of powerlessness. The confrontation would have been between the parent [or other authoritative adult] and the child, and the child is invariably going to lose because they have limited resources, and may not be as verbally dexterous. Confrontations [between adult and child] in the beginning go only one way.\u201d Later in life, it can be reminiscent of \u201calways being on the losing side\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/03/how-can-i-shift-some-of-mental-load-of-family-life-on-to-my-husband\">How can I shift some of the mental load of family life on to my husband?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What to do? Beresford suggests sitting down with your partner and exploring exactly what you are afraid of. I know, you think you know, but I want you to really unpack it. Go through each imagined contact with your friend, talk about what it is you fear, what it brings up, and then get your partner to ask you: \u201cAnd then what?\u201d Being gently challenged to really think, and not come up with hackneyed answers, can throw up surprises.</p> <p>Your friend hasn\u2019t contacted you yet, and she might not. If you wanted to be less passive, you might consider writing her a letter, asking to meet. You can be in control of what you say, and you can even say you fear meeting and not listening, or talking about yourself, so you are writing this letter first. Then, when you do meet, allow both of you the luxury of not talking much and just listening.

  "<p>Will the current Covid-19 crisis be the deluge before the storm? Are people storing up other health problems for fear of overwhelming the NHS or catching the virus themselves?</p> <p>Some doctors have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/23/accident-and-emergency-department-coronavirus-hospital-serious-conditions\">expressed concern</a> that A&amp;E departments are almost too quiet and calm. And my GP surgery is somewhat similar: we\u2019re busy with calls, emails and video consultations but almost all of them are Covid-related. And therein lies a question: where is everything else?</p> <p>Normally, I see around 30 patients in a day. This will be a mix of acute infections (respiratory, throat, ear and urine), mental health problems (anxiety, depression, stress), chronic conditions (diabetes, asthma, high blood pressure, arthritis), skin rashes, lumps and bumps. There will also be people with worrying new symptoms such as weakness, dizziness or bleeding from one orifice or another.</p> <p>In primary care, most problems that we see will get better on their own without any input from a doctor other than an explanation and reassurance. In fact, they often get better quicker if we hold back on medical intervention \u2013 most non-Covid-19 viral infections, such as coughs and colds, fall into this category.</p> <p>A second group of conditions won\u2019t usually cause immediate danger but if left untreated, will cause harm. There are lots of bits of kit that can help with self- management: a <a href=\"http://www.bloodpressureuk.org/BloodPressureandyou/Homemonitoring/Choosingyourmonitor\">blood pressure monitor</a> for hypertension, blood glucose monitors available from surgeries and pharmacists (or online), <a href=\"https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/breathing-tests/tests-measure-oxygen-levels\">pulse oximeters</a> to check oxygen levels for people with lung diseases and <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/transcutaneous-electrical-nerve-stimulation-tens/\">Tens</a> machines for pain. Urine-testing strips are useful for identifying urine infections. If positive, your GP will be only too happy to prescribe an antibiotic without you having to take in a sample.</p> <p>A patient with <a href=\"https://www.diabetes.org.uk/professionals/resources/resources-to-improve-your-clinical-practice/diabetes-self-management-education\">diabetes</a> told me that the combination of lockdown and difficulty getting food deliveries has proved an ideal opportunity for him to monitor and control his carbohydrate intake, resulting in the best blood sugar levels he\u2019s had in years. A mum whose teenager has bad <a href=\"https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/manage-your-asthma/action-plan/\">asthma</a> said that having him captive has allowed her to check that he\u2019s using his inhalers correctly, with a significant improvement in his coughing and wheezing.</p> <p>No one would wish this situation on any of us, but it has allowed these individuals and others to develop a self sufficiency that is empowering. The key is for people to report to the doctor if they don\u2019t feel well.</p> <p>The third group of people that we see is the smallest in number, most urgent medically and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/coronavirus-crisis-is-stopping-vital-cancer-care-doctors-say\">most worryingly absent</a> in this crisis: the middle-aged woman with chest pain that she thinks is indigestion but turns out to be a heart attack; the elderly man who lives on his own and keeps falling over, and urgently needs a <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pacemaker-implantation/why-its-done/\">pacemaker</a>; the brief episode of slurred speech that could be a <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/transient-ischemic-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20355679\">mini stroke</a>; a heaviness in one breast that could be breast cancer; breathlessness and a cough that\u2019s getting worse and needs a chest X-ray to check for lung cancer; a swelling in one calf after a period of immobility that could be a blood clot; the mole that has grown, changed colour and started crusting.</p> <p>In a typical week, I would see at least a few people in this last category. Now I am worried that in the past three weeks, non-Covid-19 problems seem to have vanished. I am less concerned that there may be a backlog of work for the NHS when we get back to normal \u2013 although that is a possibility.</p> <p>Self-sufficiency and resilience are fine qualities but there is no heroism in surviving the virus \u2013 or trying not to overburden NHS staff, only to succumb to other illnesses. GP surgeries and many primary care services are up and running, albeit in a modified form. Don\u2019t simply stay away: if you have a health concern that you can\u2019t solve, get in touch.</p> <p>\u2022 Ann Robinson is a GP</p>",

  "<p>Every day, the statistics bring more grim headlines: \u201cItalian death toll passes 20,000\u201d, \u201cRecord UK daily death toll\u201d, \u201cEurope\u2019s fatalities pass 100,000\u201d. Across the world, people await national updates on the coronavirus \u2013 and compare their country with others.</p> \n<p>The comparison game has been especially marked in Belgium, which on paper has the unhappy title of highest number of Covid-19 deaths per capita in Europe. Belgium \u2013 population 11.5 million \u2013 has counted at least 6,675 deaths since the start of the outbreak, more than Germany, which is nearly eight times more populous.</p> \n<p>But such comparisons can be misleading. Unlike the UK, Italy or Spain, Belgium counts all coronavirus deaths outside hospitals in its daily statistics: deaths in care homes account for 53% of the total. Belgium\u2019s official toll also includes people suspected of having died of coronavirus, without a confirmed diagnosis. Nearly all deaths in care homes (94%) are suspected Covid-19 cases, rather than confirmed \u2013 an approach that has led some to complain Belgium is overestimating the number of fatalities.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Belgium\" data-alt=\"Belgium\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Belgium\">Belgium</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Marc Van Ranst, a Belgian virologist, told the Flemish national broadcaster that the official methodology was \u201cdumb\u201d, while some ministers have voiced concern in private. \u201cNobody would benefit from reporting people as Covid deaths if they are ordinary deaths from old age,\u201d a federal government source told Flemish daily De Tijd last week.</p> \n<p>Belgian officials have defended the approach, arguing it is more precise and saves lives, as information has prompted policy changes, such as mass testing in care homes. \u201cMore and more countries are beginning to copy the Belgian model,\u201d Prof Emmanuel Andr\u00e9, the federal government\u2019s Covid-19 crisis spokesman, told journalists this week.</p> \n<p>The Netherlands has recorded at least 4,050 deaths from coronavirus, 24 deaths per 100,000 people, compared with 55 per 100,000 in neighbouring Belgium. But a Dutch health ministry spokesman said the Netherlands figure was \u201can underestimation\u201d because it only included deaths where coronavirus had been confirmed. Between 6 and 12 April, 5,036 people died in the Netherlands, compared with an average of 2,857 in the same week in the three previous years, a number of excess deaths that helps give an idea of the scale of undercounting.</p> \n<p>The UK has reported that at least 18,738 people have died in hospitals after testing positive for coronavirus. This headline figure, which is given in the government\u2019s daily briefing, also does not tell the full story. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/coronavirus-deaths-in-care-homes-in-england-and-wales-more-than-quadruple-in-a-week\">Figures from the Office for National Statistics</a> show Covid-19 fatalities in care homes in England and Wales more than quadrupled in a week, rising to 1,043, while coronavirus deaths at home more than tripled in the same period to 466. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In France, the care home number is 7,896, which represents 40% of the country\u2019s overall coronavirus deaths. The figure is almost certainly higher. France\u2019s health authority has been giving care home death figures since 3 April, when they were only \u201cpartial\u201d. Now they are said to be more or less complete figures.</p> \n<p>France has more than 10,600 public and private care homes and they are a long ignored part of the health system. Covid-19 has revealed a lack of equipment and material, including masks and testing. But it has also shown the overwhelming dedication of carers, who are largely underpaid, and under recognised for their work.</p> \n<p>One of the worst cases is in Mougins, near Grasse on the French Riviera, where 37 of 109 residents of a private care home have died of Covid-19, and 14 of 50 staff tested positive when testing was finally done.</p> \n<p>In Spain, the official number of coronavirus deaths is about 20,000. But it could be much higher if deaths in care homes are taken into account, according to the regional governments of Madrid and Catalonia, the areas hardest hit by the pandemic. Collating data from care homes and funeral directors, they say that in the two regions respectively about 4,275 and 3,000 care home residents have died from the virus.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"67a18bde-9eac-4f4d-a63b-f326eb0a8707\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Cqg575cdICU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Spanish health ministry did not request care home data until 8 April and several of the country\u2019s 17 autonomous regions have yet to provide it. Last Friday the ministry said it would continue to base its statistics on deaths of people who had been tested for the virus, thus excluding until now most care home deaths.</p> \n<p>In most of central Europe, coronavirus numbers are still much lower than in countries further west, but there is concern here too that care homes are vulnerable and could quickly lead to rising numbers. Hungary\u2019s far-right government and the liberal mayor of Budapest have been locked in a blame game over one care home in the city which has recorded 223 residents and 19 workers as being infected, about 10% of the country\u2019s total coronavirus cases.</p> \n<p>Neighbouring Slovakia has some of the lowest numbers in Europe, and until last week, just two people had died from the virus. However, seven people have since died after an outbreak in a nursing home in the town of Pezinok, and the government has promised to embark on widespread testing in homes across the country.</p> \n<p>Variations in counting of Covid-19 deaths, different testing strategies and lockdown policies make international comparisons a minefield. \u201cA comparison between [EU] member states is difficult and should be done with extreme caution,\u201d said a spokesperson at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the EU agency to tackle infectious diseases.</p> \n<p>The agency is urging governments to count everyone who dies of coronavirus, irrespective of whether they die in hospital, a care home or private residence, as well as recording deaths where Covid-19 was \u201cthe main or contributing cause\u201d.</p> \n<p><em>Data for France, Spain and central Europe was collected on </em><em>21 </em><em>April; data for the Netherlands, the UK and ECDC statistics on </em><em>23 </em><em>April, and for Belgium on </em><em>24 </em><em>April.</em></p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 27 April 2020.

Not only because it\u2019s bit of a slippery slope \u2013 if one drink, then why not two? \u2013 but it\u2019s not the best start to the following day. Not to mention an extra source of calories on top of all the cake and home-baked bread which we are now enjoying.</p> <p>You could, of course, switch to lower-alcohol wines such as the charmingly elderflowery <strong>King Richard Dry White Wine 2018</strong> (from <a href=\"https://georgehill.co.uk/\">George Hill of Loughborough</a>) I tasted the other day, which is only 10.5%, though I suspect that possibly won\u2019t affect your inclination to finish the bottle (in fact, it might even encourage you to do so). So, nights off are the safest option, but what to drink instead?</p> <p>Since I last <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jan/10/non-alcoholic-drinks-wine-spirits-dry-january-fiona-beckett\">wrote about the subject in January</a>, I\u2019ve still not found an alcohol-free wine I like (the relatively decent Sangre de Toro range in Majestic \u2013 see panel below \u2013 comes closest to it), so it\u2019s all about whatever cocktails you can concoct from what you\u2019ve got available. The most obvious option being a G&amp;T equivalent, assuming you can get the tonic. I tried to make my own from cinchona bark when I was researching my latest book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/how-to-drink-without-drinking-9780857836151.html\">How to Drink without Drinking</a>, but it was pretty disgusting and also now scarce since it was (questionably) <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/no-cinchona-bark-is-not-a-cure-for-coronavirus-134947\">touted as a cure for coronavirus</a>) Where it was once mildly annoying that products such as <a href=\"https://seedlipdrinks.com/uk/\">Seedlip</a> were much the same price as regular gin, it\u2019s now a cause for quiet fury.

The answer, I find, is to dilute it with water or, better still, water kefir (plus a few drops of orange flower water, if you have some). Or use juices to make cocktails such as a sea breeze (pink grapefruit juice, cranberry juice and lime) or the summery \u201ccroquet\u201d I invented for the book: 50ml each of a light gin substitute such as Ceder\u2019s (see panel below) and cloudy apple juice and 100ml cucumber tonic water.

  "<p>Some talk of abrasions on their faces caused by having to pull masks too tight, others about having to roll up the sleeves of their fluid-repellent gowns. Some have been left barely able to see, while others have used micropore tape to seal gaps around their jawline. The thing they all have in common?

  "<p>I nearly wasn\u2019t a huge Spider-Man fan, mostly because the first few comics I ever read were from the Kraven\u2019s Last Hunt arc, where Spider-Man is \u2026 dead. This storyline, published in 1987, sees the villainous Kraven, the son of a Russian aristocrat, donning Spider-Man\u2019s suit to rescue victims of crimes while off his face on spider-venom. In order to truly defeat his greatest enemy, Kraven can\u2019t just be content with having killed Spider-Man \u2013 he must become him, and be better than him. So off he goes, after the foes Spider-Man was never able to take down \u2013 specifically Vermin, a rat-like mutant who is kidnapping people and holding them in the sewers.</p> <p>As a 10-year-old, reading the six-issue run (originally published as Fearful Symmetry, a sly reference to William Blake), my first question was: \u201cWhere the hell is Spider-Man? My second was: \u201cAnd why is this so terrifying?\u201d</p> <p>Written by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jul/30/comics\">JM DeMatteis</a> and drawn by Mike Zeck, this arc is considered one of the greatest Spider-Man stories of all time. But when I found them in Calamity Comics in Harrow, having just been to see Back to the Future Part III in the cinema a few doors down, I wanted to read about Spidey destroying the Green Goblin. Reading these comics that night, I had to put them down. Kraven seemed crazy, Spider-Man was dead (it is later revealed he is only tranquillised, and eventually digs himself out of his grave), and Vermin was something from the recesses of my nightmares.</p> <p>Reading them again as an adult, it seems an incredibly dark story. It deals with themes of mental health and depression, impostor syndrome and self-delusion. When I read it as a 10-year-old, I just wanted to see a teenage outsider duffing up powerful monsters. I didn\u2019t want big questions about life and death. It is also about self-worth \u2013 how we define ourselves through our successes, our weaknesses, our innate sense of the person we would like to be. Kraven, humiliated by his defeats at the hands of Spider-Man, feels he can only be defined by overcoming his greatest foe. Having bested Spider-Man (and let him go once he emerges from the grave), Kraven looks back on his life and considers his achievements. He still doesn\u2019t quite understand the man under the mask, having seen nothing of Peter Parker\u2019s personal life. But he\u2019s done what he set out to do. And, spoiler alert, he kills himself.</p> <p>This was pretty dark when I was 10 and still is now. In Kraven\u2019s eyes, this is an honourable death, at the hands of the only person who could defeat him \u2026 himself. The last hunt of the title.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t appreciate the arc at the time, and it\u2019s been years since I read it. Today, in times of pandemic as we all consider our mortality, it fills me with hope. Ultimately, it\u2019s a story about taking responsibility for that which you can control and allowing the universe to balance that which you cannot.</p>",
  "<p>A Kenyan police officer has appeared before a Nairobi court charged with the murder of 23-year-old Carilton Maina, a former Leeds University student, who was shot dead in December 2018.</p> \n<p>The charging of police constable Emmanuel Ambunya Oyombe marks a significant milestone in the Kenyan government\u2019s commitment to tackling its issue with questionable police shootings, and to speeding up its justice process in bringing those accused to trial.</p> \n<p>The Milimani high court hearing on Thursday was held outdoors, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, the first time this has happened in Kenya since the 1950s state of emergency.</p> \n<p>Oyombe, who remains a serving police office, pleaded not guilty to murder. A trial date has not yet been set.</p> \n<p>He was arrested last week, according to an announcement made on social media by Kenya\u2019s director of criminal investigations. The director said the officer would be charged with the murder of Maina, who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DCI_Kenya/status/1250489528596541440?s=20\">\u201csuccumbed to gunshot wounds inflicted on him by the said officer</a>\u201d.</p> \n<p>Irungu Houghton, Amnesty International\u2019s director in Kenya, who has been lobbying the government to do more to stop such incidents, said on Thursday he had taken a keen interest in the case and welcomed the investigation.</p> \n<p>Maina\u2019s mother, Josephine Wangare, was in court, supported by a legal team from Amnesty. She said seeing someone brought to court to face trial had restored her faith in justice.</p> \n<p>\u201cI am grateful,\u201d she said. \u201cThe death of my son Carilton has been very painful for us and his friends. He was greatly loved. After a year with no one prosecuted for his death I had begun to despair.\u201d</p> \n<p>Maina was raised in Kibera, Africa\u2019s largest slum. A straight-A student, he showed exceptional talent, which eventually earned him a scholarship to Leeds University in the UK. He had returned to Kibera over the Christmas holidays and was walking home on 22 December from watching a televised football match with friends when they met two police officers.</p> \n<p>It is said that there was an exchange of words and Maina ran from the officers. At Laini Saba, a short instance from the home where he lived with his grandmother, he was hit by four bullets to his body and head.</p> \n<p>Last year the Guardian interviewed Josephine Wangare about the killing, which had sparked outrage in the local community. Students took to the streets in protest with placards demanding \u201cJustice for Maina\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4bb91b59-0f05-4f8a-acad-86fa5a8c8082\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tRHCywILQP0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The court case comes against a background of Kenya\u2019s questionably high police-related deaths \u2013 referred to as \u201cextrajudicial killings\u201d by communities and local news reports \u2013 often shootings after street interventions or stops. </p> \n<p>In an attempt to bridge the gap between themselves and people in Kibera, the Kenyan police have been carrying out a community engagement programme aimed at building trust and rooting out those who prey on the vulnerable.

  "<p>The stakes could hardly be higher; the prize still tantalisingly out of reach. It is no exaggeration to say that the fate of many millions of people rests on the discovery of a vaccine for Covid-19 \u2013 the only sure escape route from the pandemic.</p> <p>Yet the optimism that accompanied the launch of Oxford University\u2019s human trials this week has to be put in context, and the hurdles facing the scientists need to be understood.</p> <p>The vaccine hunters are trying to outwit an invisible enemy so small that a million viral particles could fit inside a human cell, but whose biological ingenuity has brought everyday life to a standstill.</p> <p>So what is the path to success?</p> <h2><strong>How vaccines train our immune system</strong></h2> <p>Traditional vaccines work by creating a weakened version of a virus, similar enough to the original that the immune system will be forearmed if the person is exposed to a full infection in future, helping prevent actual illness.</p> <p>The approach has led to some of our best vaccines, but is also fundamentally risky because there is always a chance that a newly developed attenuated virus won\u2019t be as innocuous as hoped. Clinical trials have to be approached cautiously and slowly \u2013 especially when there are no effective treatments for a disease.</p> <p>A slow approach is not ideal in a pandemic.</p> <p>So it\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that only <em>two</em> of the 76 vaccine candidates that the World Health Organization <a href=\"https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/key-action/novel-coronavirus-landscape-ncov.pdf\">has on its radar</a> have opted for this traditional approach.</p> <p>The rest rely on the fast-track idea that the immune system doesn\u2019t need to see the entire virus to generate the ammunition to fight it off in the future. If the virus is the warship, the theory is that the immune system needs only to see the enemy flag to form an indelible immune memory. In the case of Covid-19, this flag takes the form of prominent protrusions, known as spike proteins, that form a halo or \u201ccorona\u201d around the virus.</p> <p>Advances in genetic engineering have given full flight to scientists\u2019 creativity in developing this defence.</p> <p>Teams around the world have moved at unprecedented pace, going from having the genetic sequence for the spike protein in January to vaccine candidates a matter of weeks later.</p> <p>But many of these technologies are unproven and the success of any trial is far from guaranteed, as this week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/high-hopes-drug-for-covid-19-treatment-failed-in-full-trial\">disappointing results for the drug remdesivir show</a>. Ethical questions need to be navigated to ensure the safety of volunteers.</p> <p>And then, potentially the most contentious question of all: if a vaccine is found, who gets it first?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb4796d83bcae0988f754cbedcae7fea5b48bb0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb4796d83bcae0988f754cbedcae7fea5b48bb0f/0_144_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scientist Xinhua Yan works in the lab at Moderna in Cambridge, MA.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scientist Xinhua Yan works in the lab at Moderna in Cambridge, MA.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Boston Globe/Boston Globe via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The frontrunners</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/first-participant-us-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-moderna-dose\">First into clinical trials</a>, just eight weeks after the genetic sequence for Covid-19 was published in January, was the US biotech company Moderna, with its RNA vaccine.</p> <p>RNA is a single-stranded messenger molecule that normally delivers genetic instructions from DNA, coiled up inside the nuclei of cells, to the cell\u2019s protein-making factories outside the nucleus.</p> <p>In this case, the RNA instructs the muscle cells to start churning out the harmless spike protein as a warning to the immune system. Imperial College London\u2019s team, this week backed by \u00a322.5m government funding, is also developing an RNA vaccine, but in a form that hasn\u2019t been tested before in people.</p> <p>\u201cSome groups have skipped animal studies because their technology has been used in human studies,\u201d said Prof Robin Shattock, who is leading the Imperial team. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that luxury. It\u2019s probably cost us one or two months, but it\u2019s much better to be cautious and be sure you\u2019ve got something that\u2019s really safe.\u201d</p> <p>Also testing their candidates in human trials are the Chinese vaccine company CanSino Biologics, and a team at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/19/uk-drive-develop-coronavirus-vaccine-science\">Oxford University</a> led by Prof Sarah Gilbert.</p> <p>Both are using harmless viruses that have been disabled so that they don\u2019t replicate once they get inside cells. These delivery vehicles are known as \u201cnon-replicating viral vectors\u201d.</p> <p>These teams had already tried and tested the approach for other diseases, such as Ebola, and had flasks of their vectors sitting in freezers, ready to go. </p> <p>A third approach is that of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/a-second-potential-covid-19-vaccine-backed-by-bill-and-melinda-gates-is-entering-human-testing/\">US biotech company</a><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/a-second-potential-covid-19-vaccine-backed-by-bill-and-melinda-gates-is-entering-human-testing/\"> Inovio</a>, a firm that has existed for four decades without developing an approved product, but whose stock soared after it started its trial earlier this month.</p> <p>Its vaccine uses DNA to carry instructions for making the spike protein into cells, which gets transcribed into messenger RNA, which then orders the protein factories to start pumping out the enemy spike protein.</p> <p>This might seem an unnecessarily elaborate cascade, but some think that getting the enemy flag inside cells and not just into the bloodstream could be important .</p> <p>\u201cClearly it is true that there are no approved RNA or DNA vaccines on the market today,\u201d said Joseph Kim, Inovio\u2019s CEO. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s just a matter of time.\u201d</p> <p>Finally, a fourth strategy simply manufactures massive supplies of the spike protein itself, and injects a dose directly into people.</p> <p>This is what the big pharma team-up of Sanofi and GSK are betting on. Sanofi is repurposing a vaccine candidate that was developed for Sars in the early 2000s, while GSK is providing an ingredient, known as an adjuvant, that boosts the immune response, which has also been tried and tested.</p> <p>It\u2019s too early to say which option looks the most promising, according to Richard Hatchett, chief executive officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), which is funding the development and testing of eight candidates.</p> <p>\u201cSome vaccines are going to be very fast to clinic, others have tremendous potential to scale up,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the challenge that we face is that there\u2019s going to be a great deal of urgency and pressure to roll out vaccines quickly for obvious reasons. You\u2019re talking about giving a medical product to someone who is well.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>What are the odds they\u2019ll work?</strong></h2> <p>A few candidates will be filtered out in toxicology testing in animals. Others might fail because phase one trials in people produce unexpected side effects.</p> <p>There is a chance none of them will work.</p> <p>For some illnesses, including other circulating coronaviruses, the immune system wages its battle, then a few months later forgets it ever happened. Others, like chicken pox or mumps, trigger lifelong immunity.</p> <p>The truth is we\u2019re not yet sure where on this spectrum Covid-19 lies.</p> <p>\u201cReasonable guesses are that there might be partial protection for close to a year,\u201d according to Marcus Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard, whose team recently predicted that, in the absence of a vaccine, social distancing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-distancing-continue-until-2022-lockdown-pandemic\">may need to continue until 2022</a>. \u201cOn the long end, it might be several years of good protection. It\u2019s really speculative at this point.\u201d</p> <p>On the positive side, Covid-19 appears quite stable genetically, meaning that the spike protein that vaccines are built around should still look the same next winter.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t the case for flu, which shuffles its genes around so rapidly that new vaccines are needed each year.</p> <p>There are also questions around the type of immunity required.</p> <p>The body overcomes illness through antibodies, which see off the virus itself, and killer T-cells, which eliminate cells already infected by the foreign invader. For some illnesses, antibodies do the heavy lifting, but the balance varies depending on pathogen and even across people.</p> <p>\u201cAn ideal vaccine should generate a response in both arms of the immune system - antibodies and T cells,\u201d said Kim. He predicts this could be a weakness of RNA and protein vaccines, which are delivered outside of cells, meaning that killer T-cells are not likely to be recruited.</p> <p>There is also a chance that some trials could grind to a halt, simply because the pandemic has been so well controlled by lockdowns and other measures. \u201cYou need a certain hit rate in the population you\u2019re vaccinating to get the statistics to show your vaccine is having protective ability,\u201d said Miles Carroll, head of research at Public Health England\u2019s National Infection Service at Porton Down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc99c90aad2dd10402feba15b556c9d85f4162fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc99c90aad2dd10402feba15b556c9d85f4162fc/0_172_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson visits a laboratory at the Public Health England National Infection Service in London in early March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson visits a laboratory at the Public Health England National Infection Service in early March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The possibility of \u201cchallenge trials\u201d, in which people are deliberately infected, have been considered, but there are obvious ethical issues with exposing volunteers to a potentially deadly disease. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest in this \u2026 because it would really accelerate vaccine development, but there are some major hurdles to ensure the safety of the volunteers in that setting,\u201d said Prof Andrew Pollard, chief investigator on the Oxford study.</p> <h2><strong>Scaling-up</strong></h2> <p>Vaccine manufacturers talk in terms of yield: how many doses of vaccine do you get out per litre of culture. And there could be significant differences in the ability of teams to produce the number of doses required to make a difference.</p> <p>Shattock believes this will be a strength of Imperial\u2019s RNA vaccine candidate, which has the unique feature of replicating itself thousands of times once inside the body.</p> <p>\u201cWe can make the equivalent of a million doses within a litre of material,\u201d said Shattock. \u201cMany other vaccines would need hundreds or thousands of litres for that. It\u2019s the scalability. Towards the end of the year we\u2019ll be hoping to make tens of millions of doses.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf our vaccine were shown to be successful, if everything goes well \u2013 and that\u2019s still a big if \u2013 we could deploy it in the UK this winter,\u201d said Shattock. \u201cAll these smaller approaches will hold the fort until a larger global solution comes.\u201d</p> <p>By September there could be a vaccine \u2013 maybe several \u2013 that appear broadly safe and effective.</p> <p>That\u2019s not enough to get a vaccine licensed, but governments are already talking about the potential for rolling out such candidates to high-risk groups, potentially including millions of health workers, under \u201cemergency use\u201d rules in the absence of this ultimate seal of approval.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>There are precedents for this \u2013 in the 2018 Ebola outbreak, more than 200,000 people in Democratic Republic of Congo received the Merck vaccine before it was licensed in 2019.</p> <p>\u201cThat might be enough if you are an intensive care nurse or living in an old people\u2019s home, to say that for you, because you have the most to gain from being vaccinated, the risk-benefit balance is favourable,\u201d said Sandy Douglas, an Oxford vaccine researcher.</p> <p>But very rare side-effects cannot be ruled out. And there have been vaccine calamities in the past \u2013 recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/10/boy-wins-120000-damages-narcolepsy-swine-flu-vaccine-glaxosmithkline\">the GSK vaccine Pandemrix</a>, given to millions during the swine flu pandemic of 2009, which was linked to narcolepsy in one in every 55,000 jabs.</p> <p>The principle of transparent informed consent will be critical, Douglas added. \u201cIn this case, that would include the fact that if you\u2019re being offered a vaccine in October that didn\u2019t exist in April, there will not yet be long-term safety follow-up experience, although we do have longer term experience with several similar vaccines.\u201d</p> <p>Individuals could be faced with tough choices \u2013 take an experimental vaccine or leave themselves at risk of infection.</p> <h2><strong>Global solution</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfb868265e8e7689732af72e9fa16782da3b1041\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfb868265e8e7689732af72e9fa16782da3b1041/0_224_3582_2149/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman in Tokyo wearing a mask to help stop the spread of the coronavirus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman in Tokyo wearing a mask to help stop the spread of the coronavirus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eugene Hoshiko/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the moment, many teams are trying all sorts of ways to develop a vaccine, but there is no coherent solution for the whole planet. Some are banking on big pharma swooping in with a blockbuster product. Sanofi and GSK, as a joint force, are unique in having the ability to manufacture hundreds of millions of doses without relying on external support.</p> <p>But multinationals are not built for speed and their reputations depend on absolute safety, so there is no prospect of this team making its vaccine widely available before mid to late-2021.</p> <p>Others urge a unified approach; governments, the UN, the World Bank and the WHO need to agree a way forward before a lead candidate emerges.</p> <p>National governments are already making advance purchase agreements and looking to secure their own supply chains.</p> <p>\u201cIf vaccine nationalism asserts itself, you could end up having a limitation of a vaccine to one specific population,\u201d said Hatchett. \u201cIt\u2019s an understandable response of a leader who is elected by a particular population to protect that population. [But] you can\u2019t protect your people and your economy until the global pandemic is brought under control. We really can\u2019t deal with this one country at a time.\u201d</p> <p>Hatchett and others are arguing for a global commitment of tens of billions of dollars to ensure that any successful vaccine is distributed globally and according to need. \u201cIn global health terms that\u2019s a very big number,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if your point of reference is the global impact that this pandemic is having on the economy, then that\u2019s a very small number. If you buy into the idea that the vaccine is the escape route from the pandemic then that\u2019s a really good investment.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 April 2020 to clarify that RNA delivers genetic instructions from DNA within the cell, rather than outside the cell as originally suggested in \u201cThe frontrunners\u201d section.</p>",

So why has there been such a divergence on this issue?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/11/can-a-face-mask-protect-me-from-coronavirus-covid-19-myths-busted\">Can a face mask protect me from coronavirus? Covid-19 myths busted</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most of us would probably ask how well a mask, especially a one made from cloth, may protect us from Covid-19. But the notion of \u201cpersonal protection\u201d misses the major reason why calls for increased use of masks and face-coverings have gained momentum around the world. From February, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5\">data was emerging</a> that, unlike Sars \u2013 where patients were most contagious several days after showing severe symptoms \u2013 people infected by Sars-Cov-2, the cause of Covid-19, were \u201cshedding\u201d most viruses (that could infect someone else)<strong> </strong>just before or at the time symptoms first appeared, often in very mild form. This had two implications: first, efforts to \u201ccontain\u201d coronavirus would be orders of magnitude more difficult than for Sars. Second, and as it has turned out more contentiously, the official World Health Organization and UK government advice that masks should only be worn by members of the public showing symptoms, and members of their immediate households, is probably wrong.</p> <p>In the field of infectious diseases, stopping a contagious patient infecting others is known as source control. For respiratory infections, source control would include wearing a mask when not under isolation. By advising symptomatic individuals to wear a mask, the government was advocating source control. But what if symptomatic individuals were only half the story? When people have been systematically tested for Covid-19, be it <a href=\"https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.10.2000180\">passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship</a> or <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2009316\">women about to give birth in New York</a>, the number of individuals who test positive but display no symptoms is about half the total number of those who test positive (the range is 20-90%, but most agree it\u2019s 40-60%).</p> <p>So can completely \u201cwell\u201d people transmit Covid-19? We know that even <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2007800\">normal speech can spread droplets</a>, and this is dramatically reduced by the use of cloth masks. And for symptomatic people infected with common-cold coronaviruses and <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/115/5/1081\">influenza</a>, normal breathing also results in shedding of virus, which again, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2\">is blocked</a> by wearing a mask. While we don\u2019t know for sure how contagious a truly asymptomatic Covid-19 patient might be, <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-16-testing\">evidence</a> <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/04/09/science.abb6936\">suggests</a> that around 40% of cases of transmission arise from people without symptoms.</p> <p>So what are the objections that have been raised against masks in public as policy? There have been repeated statements that the evidence in favour of masks is flimsy and ambiguous. For medics, the \u201cgold standard\u201d of evidence is the randomised controlled trial (some people take the medicine or undergo the intervention, and some don\u2019t, and we look to see if there were benefits or risks). There have been a few trials looking at masks for preventing influenza, and results were disappointing \u2013 although crucially, most of the group meant to wear masks actually didn\u2019t: it turns out we\u2019re just not that scared of catching the flu.</p> <p>But if one looks at the same level of evidence for the other measures strongly advocated by the government, for example hand-washing, studies have been similarly disappointing. And for other advice, such as the two-metre rule, or lockdowns, there have been no trials at all. So masks seem subject to a different standard of evidence than other measures. And while controlled trial data is not available, \u201cnatural experiments\u201d do suggest at least a correlation between mask-wearing and reduced Covid-19 transmission. The city of Jena in Germany introduced mandatory mask-wearing on 31 March and <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/17/no-new-infections-german-city-impose-facemasks/\">recorded no new infections for eight days</a>, while surrounding cities continued to see a rise.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/24/uk-coronavirus-live-warning-mass-vaccinations-covid-19-latest-updates\">UK coronavirus live: officials apologise after key workers denied tests on day one of Hancock scheme</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other objections include claims that wearing a mask increases other risky behaviours, such as a relaxed attitude to distancing (comparable to the idea that dangerous driving would increase when seatbelts became law), or that contaminated masks will increase rather than decrease infections. In Hong Kong, where mask uptake is an astonishing 98%, there have been no reports of harms associated with the practice, indeed, only four people have died from Covid-19 since the beginning of the outbreak.</p> <p>That perhaps leaves the final objection, which is that the public wearing masks will divert this scarce resource away from hospitals and care homes. In this sense, the government may simply be dragging its feet because of scarcity \u2013 which is a political and economic issue, not a scientific one. It might also explain the recent focus on cloth masks or face-coverings over masks: by advocating these,<strong> </strong>there is no competition with the NHS. And although less PR-worthy than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/21/we-made-right-choice-in-ventilator-race-says-uk-consortium-head\">collaborations with Rolls-Royce</a> to produce ventilators, other partnerships between government and industry could ensure high-quality cloth masks for everyone in the country.</p> <p>As the government equivocates, unlike our European neighbours, the British public may end up being the \u201ccontrol group\u201d for the face mask experiment the government has been demanding all along. But do we want to be?</p> <ul> <li><p>Babak Javid is a professor at the Tsinghua University School of Medicine in Beijing and a consultant in infectious diseases at Cambridge University hospitals<br></p></li> </ul>",

Every time a healthcare worker becomes hospitalised with Covid-19, it exacts an extraordinary toll on our friends, family and colleagues.</p> \n<p>\u201cTo sedate and ventilate your own colleague takes a mental toll on the entire workforce. The government owes an apology to these bereaved families, many of whom were unable to be with their loved ones in their dying moments.\u201d</p> \n<p>Joshi told the Guardian he hoped his challenge would not have to go to court. He welcomed the latest comments from the health secretary, Matt Hancock, as a first acknowledgment that \u201cthe guidelines are based on resources. There was a shortage [of PPE] and the government has not been transparent about why they engaged British manufacturers.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said he had been contacted by doctors from around the country \u201cwho have been trying to raise concerns [about the lack of PPE] because they feel intimidated by managers in their own NHS trusts.\u201d He said he had talked to an NHS cleaner who felt compelled to work even though she felt unprotected.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have lost count of the number of colleagues who have gone off sick through confirmed or suspected coronavirus. Some have become very unwell and some have ended up in hospital \u2026 Doctors don\u2019t want to go into hpspital [as patients]. There\u2019s an embarrassment of being treated colleagues and they don\u2019t to show [what hey think is] weakeness.\u201d</p> \n<p>Public Heath England said: \u201cThe safety of those working on the frontline in health and social care is our number one priority. The UK guidance, written with NHS leaders and agreed by all four chief medical officers, in consultation with royal and medical colleges, recommends the safest level of personal protective equipment .

Had they been, she would have received a medal, because she finished third.</p> <p>Once described by the athlete <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/mar/01/guardianobituaries\">Chris Brasher</a> as \u201cthe stuff of which empire is made\u201d, Sayer was one of the finest long-distance walkers ever produced by Britain, a GB international in two sports \u2013 rowing and walking \u2013 and undoubtedly one of its greatest female athletes. As the first woman in Britain to qualify, in 1977, as a <a href=\"http://www.centurions1911.org.uk/index.html\">Centurion</a> \u2013 someone who has walked 100 miles in under 24 hours \u2013 she was a pioneer in women\u2019s athletics and the record she set in 1980, for the fastest ever Land\u2019s End to John O\u2019Groats walk by a woman, is still unbroken. Her time \u2013 13 days, 17 hours and 42 minutes \u2013 was beaten by Sandra Brown in 1995, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/sep/17/theobserver.uknews3\">in 2006 Sharon Gayter completed the route</a> even faster, but both ran at least some of the way, and these are regarded as running records. Sayer walked every step of her 840-mile route.</p> <p>Six feet tall, with immensely long legs and flying blond curls, Sayer had a relentless, unremitting stride that earned her the nickname \u201cmetronome\u201d. In full flight she was a magnificent sight, Amazonian.</p> <p>The youngest of three children of Rose (nee Wilson) and Ernest Sayer, Ann was born in Whitstable, Kent, where her father was a tobacconist and watch repairer. Her sporting background was in rowing, which she took up at London University. After graduating with a degree in geology, she worked for the petroleum company BP and rowed in an eight for United Universities (which was later merged into the Thames Rowing Club): \u201cIt was nice to overtake men\u2019s crews when we were practising, though usually they had to be quite bad for that to happen.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ee8ba46f7b54b105339dd5a7dbf7aafce5185925\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee8ba46f7b54b105339dd5a7dbf7aafce5185925/255_69_2410_3879/621.jpg\" alt=\"Ann Sayer: her relentless stride earned her the nickname \u2018metronome\u2019\" width=\"621\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ann Sayer: her relentless stride earned her the nickname \u2018metronome\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: None</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Women\u2019s rowing was not admitted to the Olympic programme until the 1970s, but she was selected for Great Britain in the 1962 European Championships, in which they reached the final, finishing fifth. The crew were largely self-funding, buying their own boat and blades, and had to sew Great Britain on the backs of their tracksuits. \u201cSome of the sewing was rather uneven,\u201d Sayer said.</p> <p>She was in her late 30s when she took up race walking. At the time, the longest event for women was 5km and when, in October 1977, she became the first woman in Britain to break the barrier for completing 100 miles in under 24 hours, resignations were offered rather than allow her to join the elite all-male club of Centurions. She was nevertheless admitted, though two years later she was barred from competing at another Centurions event, when the organisers claimed the venue did not have the facilities for women.</p> <p>\u201cI was not aggressively women\u2019s lib,\u201d she said of her successful battle for acceptance in this male-dominated world. \u201cI was more bolshy than anything. If men were allowed to be daft and do 24-hour walks, why not us? Why shouldn\u2019t a woman do this?\u201d</p> <p>In person, Sayer was quiet, with a wry sense of humour and a reluctance to blow her own trumpet. She was very much a team player so it was ironic that she excelled in such a solitary pursuit as long-distance walking. When planning her attempt on the Land\u2019s End to John O\u2019Groats record , she was asked how many miles she thought she could accomplish in one day. She responded that she had walked the best part of 120 miles in 24 hours and found it rather exhausting, but that she should be able to manage 60 miles a day every day for just under a fortnight. On the final day she walked 76 miles. \u201cI was quite glad to get to the finish,\u201d she said.</p> <p>In 1994 she became the oldest woman to represent GB when she was selected for a 200km race in France. In 2005 she was appointed MBE for services to sport.

  "<p>Camden might seem like a strange place for a coronavirus outbreak. It\u2019s a small, historic city in central South Carolina \u2013 just over 7,500 people. It\u2019s neither densely packed like New York nor economically decimated like Detroit. One of its main industries is tourism, with people visiting to see Revolutionary War re-enactments and the annual horse race every spring.</p> <p>But on 6 March the first Covid-19 case was confirmed positive \u2013 an elderly woman whose family had visited her after traveling to Europe. Soon after that, Camden had the fastest-growing number of cases, and deaths, in the state. At one point it had the most coronavirus cases per capita in the country.</p> <p>While Camden\u2019s local officials worked relatively quickly to try to contain the virus, experts say it\u2019s not surprising that the city was caught unprepared. The South Carolina government has systematically dismantled public health infrastructure for over a decade \u2013 from reductions to the health budget to diluting a minority health program. The state\u2019s response to the pandemic was one of the slowest in the country.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s an interesting dynamic \u2013 it\u2019s state, local and federal,\u201d said state senator Vincent Sheheen, who represents Kershaw county, where Camden is the seat. \u201cI think that\u2019s where the problems come in: who is responsible for what? That has not been well defined, and it wasn\u2019t well defined before the crisis.\u201d</p> <p>This disconnect was clear starting with the first Covid-19 test. When health workers suspected the Camden woman of having the virus, the state refused to process a swab sample, Sheheen said, because she didn\u2019t meet the criteria. It was days after the patient was admitted to Kershaw Health, the county\u2019s only hospital, that the state\u2019s department of health and environmental control (DHEC) agreed.</p> <p>For a few days, as Camden city officials worked to formulate a plan and shut down public events, people still went out to restaurants and events. An Irish Fest, being held that weekend, took place. So did a funeral, which tracing later linked to <a href=\"https://www.thestate.com/news/coronavirus/article242028041.html?fbclid=IwAR2pt9DCcuf-istDtAUsHJuwx9c4dpGV3qhSlxpWewM6-O-lWMAz3x9aApg\">six deaths</a> in the city.</p> <p>\u201cNo one took it seriously,\u201d said Nyasha Green, a 30-year-old Camden native who now lives half an hour away from her parents in Columbia. \u201cThey should have quarantined people already.\u201d</p> <p>By the next week, however, the city had shut down public gatherings, and was working to close the area\u2019s many churches. Dozens of businesses closed their doors, and city council members urged people to stay home. By 14 March, Camden shut down schools, and some days later, enforced a 10pm curfew.</p> <p>\u201cWe started taking precautions before the state had a chance to lead,\u201d said Mel Pearson, the city manager. \u201cWe knew this was a risky virus.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fad52158360c20efba82f595e2a6d9fd2e07add3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fad52158360c20efba82f595e2a6d9fd2e07add3/0_0_6240_4160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An empty church stands in a rural and economically distressed part of Camden, South Carolina.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An empty church stands in a rural and economically distressed part of Camden, South Carolina. \u2018The standard of living is low.

By then, Camden had more than 170 positive coronavirus cases, and a handful of deaths. Neighboring counties, such as Richland, were now faring worse.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We see this combination of higher rates of chronic conditions combined with poor access in the state</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>South Carolina has been a consistently Republican state for decades. It has also become increasingly focused on shrinking the government \u2013 cutting the public sector in favor of privatization \u2013 a key characteristic of America\u2019s fiscally conservative politicians.</p> <p>Governor McMaster is <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/publications/white-paper/fiscal-policy-report-card-americas-governors-2018\">widely known</a> for curbing taxes and public benefits like pensions for government workers. But cuts to the state health department and infrastructure have left people in poor and rural areas with little access to care because of <a href=\"https://ifs-mpr.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=47c9824a5b9e41219bc3f542191ddf81\">physician shortages</a> and hospital closures. </p> <p>\u201cHaley and Sanford have been gutting our state health agency for over 10 years,\u201d Sheheen said of the two former Republican governors. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise doctors are left reusing their masks.\u201d</p> <p>The state\u2019s most recent three leaders, including Governor Nikki Haley, who later joined the Trump administration, chose not to expand the Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act, which would have extended public health insurance to thousands of working-class families.</p> <p>The result was that more people <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/the-coverage-gap-uninsured-poor-adults-in-states-that-do-not-expand-medicaid/\">remained uninsured</a>, and had less access to medical care. In Camden, about 10% of the population <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/camdencitysouthcarolina\">has no</a> health insurance, higher than the national average of <a href=\"https://khn.org/news/number-of-americans-without-insurance-rises-in-2018/\">about</a> 8%.</p> <p>A lack of insurance also means people have gone without treatment and are more likely to have underlying health conditions, said Samantha Artiga, a director of Medicaid and disparities teams at Kaiser Family Foundation, a not-for-profit research organization. South Carolina is <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/states/southcarolina/southcarolina.htm\">among</a> the US states with the highest rates of heart disease, respiratory issues and strokes.</p> <p>\u201cWe see this combination of higher rates of chronic conditions combined with poor access in the state,\u201d Artiga said. \u201cThat leaves a population at higher risk of experiencing complications if they have Covid.\u201d</p> <p>While the government has applauded the expansion of <a href=\"https://www.prismahealth.org/\">private health</a> companies like Prisma Health, at least six rural hospitals have <a href=\"https://www.shepscenter.unc.edu/programs-projects/rural-health/rural-hospital-closures/\">closed down</a> since 2010. And legislators have slashed millions from DHEC - including a $16 million cut in 2018 \u2013 and curbed funds for safety net clinics.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The workers that interface with elderly people, or who are caregivers are poor people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Cheryl Armstead, a psychology and public health professor at the University of South Carolina, said the state\u2019s ruthless approach to public health has had tangible consequences on its most vulnerable communities during the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cCamden is a small town, denoted by the haves and have-nots,\u201d she said. \u201cThe workers that interface with elderly people, or who are caregivers are poor people.\u201d About <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/camdencitysouthcarolina\">14%</a> of residents in the city live in poverty, according to the census, and a disproportionate number of poor people are black.</p> <p>Armstead said black communities are less likely to trust the government, an issue further tested during the Covid-19 crisis. In recent years, South Carolina also weakened a vaccine program previously under the office of minority health.</p> <p>Furthermore, the persistent trauma around the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/timeline.htm\">Tuskegee experiment</a>, a racist government project, and the Henrietta Lacks case, where a black woman\u2019s cells were used without consent, still inform people\u2019s decisions around healthcare in the south. Black church leaders have had to step in to relay public health information.</p> <p>\u201cI think a sense of fatalism has occurred,\u201d Armstead said of black people in South Carolina. \u201cThe feeling is that they won\u2019t get equal healthcare.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Who is responsible for what?

Pearson, the city manager, said people were still worried, but that local efforts had been largely successful. \u201cIt\u2019s trending down now, which is a good sign,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But the city is still carefully tracking the number of cases before making any plans to reopen. Pearson said he was hoping that eventually, Camden would be able to attract visitors again, drawing tourism to the historic town.</p> <p>Until then, Green said she is regularly checking on her family, including her parents, who are in their 60s.</p> <p>\u201cI try to make sure they have everything they need,\u201d she said. \u201cI drove down there and put toilet paper on their porch.\u201d</p>",

  "<h2>Monday</h2> <p>I\u2019ve never much liked the person I am. Anxiety and depression are still my default settings, even after decades of therapy, and I find it hard to hold on to any good feelings. It\u2019s like constantly watching joy slip through my fingers. But I like still less the person I have become during the coronavirus pandemic because now I view even friends as a possible source of disease and infection. I long to hug and be hugged but I have become overly protective of my personal space and get irritable if any runner gets within 5 metres of me. The only place I really feel safe now is my bedroom.</p> <p>Nor does it help that on a daily basis it becomes more evident that there is no clear plan for navigating our way through the crisis. Ministers are flying blind and the country has effectively been orphaned by the government. One of the less reported side-effects of the pandemic has been the way No 10 has sent out a string of no-mark ministers to do the morning media round, all of whose prime brief appears to have been to know as little as possible about anything. This week we\u2019ve had Oliver Dowden, Simon Clarke, Helen Whately and Brandon Lewis all failing to answerbasic questions. You\u2019d have thought that if you knew you were going to face the media, you\u2019d bother to learn some key facts, such as the number of NHS staff and care home workers who had died, but they couldn\u2019t even manage that. And it\u2019s not as if it was hard to find the answers, as they were all featured in many newspapers\u2019 double page spreads.</p> <p>Equally astonishing has been the rehabilitation of Piers Morgan. After several years of sucking up to Donald Trump, refusing to take anyone with mental health issues seriously and insisting that those who dared to criticise Brexit whining remoaners, he has become the nation\u2019s mouthpiece on Good Morning Britain by asking the tough questions and vocalising many people\u2019s anger at the government\u2019s failures. These really must be extraordinary times.</p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>The end of each season\u2019s University Challenge feels like a personal loss. I\u2019ve watched every episode without fail for decades now and am sad enough to keep a tally of my own score each week. I award myself one point for each correct answer \u2013 regardless whether it is a starter or bonus question \u2013 and disappear into a shame spiral if I score less than 10.</p> <p>This year\u2019s final promised to be a straight showdown between Imperial\u2019s Brandon and Corpus Christi\u2019s Wang, but in the end it was no contest, with Brandon cruising to victory. About 10 years ago I was able to fulfil a lifetime\u2019s ambition by appearing on one of the Christmas special series and learned the hard way that it\u2019s far more testing in real life than from the comfort of the sofa. It\u2019s not just knowing the answer but being quick enough on the buzzer.</p> <p>During my outing for Exeter against Glasgow, me and the rest of our team went into a blind panic when we realised we were trailing by about 110 points to 20 at the halfway stage. Not just because we didn\u2019t know all the answers but because we couldn\u2019t remember them quickly enough. There was one member of the Glasgow team who was beating us near-single-handedly because he was so much faster to react. So I made a decision that the only way to avoid total humiliation was to start pressing the buzzer even if I was only halfway sure of the answer because then at least we were in with a chance. It proved a mixed blessing as I got some answers embarrassingly wrong \u2013 my kids are gutted they haven\u2019t been able to find the episode on YouTube \u2013 but we did at least claw our way up to 120 and only lost by about 40. Never again.</p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>It was amazing how difficult parliament found it to adapt to new technology, given that most small businesses and family groups who had never heard of Zoom a month ago can now schedule meetings at will. After a dry run on Tuesday, the House of Commons finally returned to the new normal with an almost empty chamber for prime minister\u2019s questions and a ministerial statement from Matt Hancock.</p> <p>Weirdly the quiet of the chamber seemed to suit Keir Starmer, a QC who is totally at home in a courtroom drama, and he managed to make Dominic Raab look like a struggling pupil barrister. Even the technology by and large held up, though David Mundell couldn\u2019t log in and Peter Bone got cut off near the end. Straight afterwards there were a few conspiracy theories running that Bone had been cut off because he was questioning the conduct of the banks during the pandemic. I rather think the bosses of Barclay\u2019s, Lloyd\u2019s and HSBC have got better things to do than order their IT departments to silence the Bone. It\u2019s far more likely the Bone silenced himself by accidentally pressing the mute button.</p> <p>Much weirder was the presence of Jeremy Corbyn in the chamber, given that he is over 70 and therefore officially classed in the vulnerable category. His question to Matt Hancock could just as easily have been asked by Zoom. Even more bizarrely, Corbyn was later spotted by one of my more happy-go-lucky colleagues, who is still brave enough to go into work, pulling up a chair from a table that had been deliberately kept apart from neighbouring ones to sit and have lunch with a friend. It seems like the guidance on self-isolation hasn\u2019t yet filtered down to everyone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57425f2e942f32325d71d9bbbdfdc27ba27766b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57425f2e942f32325d71d9bbbdfdc27ba27766b7/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn in the House of Commons,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn: \u2018I still think I won the argument\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>There are some calls you don\u2019t want to get. I was sitting in the garden having lunch with my wife when my phone rang from a number I didn\u2019t recognise. But I took it anyway. \u201cAm I speaking to Mr Crace?\u201d asked the caller. Yes, she was. \u201cGood, then I was wondering, given your age whether you had given any thought to a full, pre-paid funeral plan.\u201d</p> <p>My first reaction was that this must be a wind-up from a friend and I asked her to repeat what she had just said to check I hadn\u2019t misheard. I hadn\u2019t. This woman was extremely anxious that I might die in the next few weeks and leave no money to pay for my funeral. At which point, I rather lost it. \u201cAre you seriously ringing me up in the middle of a coronavirus crisis to try and flog me a funeral insurance policy?\u201d I said. \u201cBecause right now that\u2019s the last thing I want to think about as I\u2019m rather hoping to survive.\u201d</p> <p>My wife snapped at me, saying I shouldn\u2019t be so rude and that the woman was only reading off a call centre script. If so, the script could do with some fine-tuning, because far from apologising for interrupting my lunch and adding to my morbid ruminations, she doubled down. \u201cThe reason I am calling you now is precisely because of coronavirus,\u201d she said. \u201cThere has never been a better time for people of your age to get their affairs in order. At which point I invited her to try upsetting someone else and hung up.</p> <p>Covid-19 might be most people\u2019s nightmare, but it\u2019s clearly a business opportunity for some others. In just a few weeks we\u2019ve moved on from ambulance chasers to hearse chasers. I can feel the cold breath of death on my shoulder.</p> <h2>Friday</h2> <p>The weekends used to be a highlight of the week; a time to relax and spend time with friends and family. Now I have come to rather dread them. I prefer the tempo of a working day when I try to keep track of the latest ministerial promises and disasters for the sketch. Saturdays and Sundays now just feel like days with no structure, 16 hours in which I know I have a few key tasks \u2013 going for a bike ride, doing a bit of housework, making lunch \u2013 to complete, but all of which feel like they could be done at any other time. As a result my anxiety is often worse at weekends as there is more down time into which my fear can expand.</p> <p>Still, I am still just about managing to keep the weekends a news-free zone. Though I do read the papers, I try to avoid bulletins on the radio and TV. Apart from anything else, they are bad for my blood pressure. How the government can even be contemplating sticking to its decision to end Brexit transition on 31 December when it has no idea of how bad the coronavirus epidemic will be or its effect on the economy is beyond me. Even a 12-year-old must be able to see it\u2019s dim-witted; unless of course you are hoping to blame some of the worst impacts of Brexit on the coronavirus.</p> <p>But I did promise to try and end with some upbeat thoughts. So here they are. I have been overwhelmed by the kindness of people emailing to ask me if I\u2019m OK and for the unexpected gifts given to me by friends both new and old. Humanity is back in fashion. I\u2019ve also been listening to YouTube clips of singers whose performances I will now miss.</p> <p>This week\u2019s recommendation is the exquisite Asmik Grigorian singing the Moon Song from Dvorak\u2019s Rusalka. She will both break your heart and mend it.</p> <p>Finally, a shout out to my banana plants. Normally they are still wrapped in their fleeces at this time of year; in the warm weather they have taken matters into their own hands and have grown so much, a few have discarded their fleeces by themselves. I need some more of the bananas\u2019 fighting spirit.</p> <p><strong>Digested week, digested:</strong> Capacity to test: 51,000. Actual tests: 23,000</p>",
  "<p>I\u2019d missed the joke about the three-legged chicken. It was causing a stir.</p> <p>\u201cThat one about the chicken with three legs you told yesterday,\u201d said a presenter on Ireland\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.midwestradio.ie/\">Midwest Radio</a>\u2019s afternoon show, \u201capparently Ronald Reagan told it first.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid he, now?\u201d the co-host replied.</p> <p>\u201cYes. You stole a joke from Ronald Reagan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJeez, I\u2019m going as red as a tomato here.\u201d</p> <p>The conjunction of tripedal fowl, the 40th president of the United States and two men in a studio in Ballyhaunis, County Mayo, will never make a list of great radio moments but it was enough to coax me from between my four walls, even if it was via the imagination.</p> <p>Radio has never been more popular: it\u2019s seen off challenges, from television to the internet, to become stronger than ever. In 2017, according to industry ratings body Rajar, nine out of 10 people in the UK listened to the radio every week. Perhaps it succeeds because we have to conjure up our own pictures of events and places beyond our immediate surroundings. As a bored, lonely boy growing up in an anonymous south-east London suburb, I\u2019d spend most evenings in my bedroom jamming a coathanger into the back of an old radio and scanning the airwaves, awestruck by the range of languages and music bursting out of the night through skirling static; each voice sending tantalising reassurance of a world beyond the dispiriting confines of my own.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2cdbd37831b8a4b71c19563b360ddcb4c33b16d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2cdbd37831b8a4b71c19563b360ddcb4c33b16d/0_194_3534_2122/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charlie Connelly travels the world, wirelessly.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlie Connelly travels the world, wirelessly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlie Connelly</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We\u2019re living through a different kind of isolation these days but radio is again a valuable form of escape. If we can\u2019t go to the world then it has to come to us and, thanks to its radio stations, is available at the touch of a screen. Streaming has made global radio local and I can eavesdrop on continents through their breakfast shows, travel bulletins and drive-time programmes on a range of devices. </p> <p>A good way to navigate the crowded airwaves is through the <a href=\"http://radio.garden/visit/bow/ighZQ5vt\">Radio Garden app</a>: a portal set up by Dutch national broadcaster NPO in which a tide of little green dots washes across the surface of the planet, each representing a different station.

  "<p>Native Americans are being left out of demographic data on the impact of the coronavirus across the US, raising fears of hidden health emergencies in one of the country\u2019s most vulnerable populations.</p> <p>A Guardian analysis found that about 80% of state health departments have released some racial demographic data, which has already revealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/its-a-racial-justice-issue-black-americans-are-dying-in-greater-numbers-from-covid-19\">stark disparities</a> in the impact of Covid-19 in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/us/coronavirus-race.html\">black</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/04/08/829726964/new-york-citys-latinx-residents-hit-hardest-by-coronavirus-deaths\">Latinx communities</a>.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Native Americans experience diabetes<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/aian-diabetes/index.html\"> three times more</a> than any other racial or ethnic group in the United States, and have the <a href=\"https://www.indianz.com/News/archive/000408.asp\">highest rates of asthma</a>.

The majority of Native Americans live in urban areas, with the highest populations in New York City and Los Angeles. But <a href=\"https://abc7.com/los-angeles-county-coronavirus-covid-19-in-the-black-community/6087896/\">neither</a> explicitly include Native Americans in <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/covid-19-deaths-race-ethnicity-04082020-1.pdf\">the breakdowns of their Covid</a><a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/covid-19-deaths-race-ethnicity-04082020-1.pdf\">-19 data</a>.</p> <p>The NYC department of health and mental hygiene did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment. The Los Angeles county department of public health said it was \u201clooking into getting more accurate information on the race/ethnicity field\u201d and hoped to provide \u201cmore meaningful reports on this in the future\u201d.</p> <p>Half of all American Indian and Alaskan Natives live in just 10 states, <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/history/pdf/c2010br-10.pdf\">according to the US Census Bureau</a>. As of 21 April, all 10 had published some racial demographic data, but four \u2013 Texas, Florida, New York and Michigan \u2013 had not included a breakdown for Native Americans. A spokesperson for the Texas department of state health services said that Native Americans were categorized as \u201cother\u201d because their case numbers were small compared with other groups.</p> <p>\u201cWe are a small population of people because of genocide. No other reason,\u201d said Echo-Hawk. \u201cIf you eliminate us in the data, we don\u2019t exist. We don\u2019t exist for the allocation of resources.\u201d</p> <p>Leaving Native Americans out of public health data is not new in the US. For example in January, the CDC released its most comprehensive study to date on race and maternal mortality rates, but American Indians and Alaskan Natives were not included. When the Urban Indian Health Institute did its own research, it found Native women living in cities were 4.5 times more likely to die during pregnancy and childbirth than white women.</p> <p>Health experts have also warned that local and state health departments that are including Native Americans in their demographic data are still likely to be undercounting Native Covid-19 patients and deaths due to racial misclassification.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f9d69d511796fe054cb9f549ce1820fa5f015597\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9d69d511796fe054cb9f549ce1820fa5f015597/0_0_2400_1614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"This week, the health authority for the Navajo Nation, which includes areas of Arizona, Utah and New Mexico, reported 1,197 positive coronavirus cases and 44 deaths.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This week, the health authority for the Navajo Nation, which includes areas of Arizona, Utah and New Mexico, reported 1,197 positive coronavirus cases and 44 deaths.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kristin Murphy/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to some studies, Native Americans have a 50% chance of being listed as the wrong race on medical records, as well as birth and death certificates. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4545338/\">A 2015 study of hospital discharge records in Oregon</a> found that over half of Native patients had been miscategorized on their file, the majority as white.

But IHS cannot track hospitalization or mortality data for most of its patients, because the majority of IHS facilities do not provide intensive care, and so critically ill patients are transferred to non-IHS hospitals.</p> <p>The \u201cIHS may not be notified of deaths\u201d wrote an agency spokesperson. Therefore \u201cto avoid underreporting\u201d, IHS is only publishing testing results, they said.</p> <p>But testing numbers are also incomplete. The IHS includes a network of facilities operated<strong> </strong> by the IHS, tribal health services,<strong> </strong>and urban providers. Only IHS direct service facilities are required to report their data , representing about 17% of the facilities in the system. For all others, data sharing is voluntary. According to an IHS spokesperson, about a third of tribally run and urban facilities have reported their numbers.</p> <p>IHS is also hampered by an electronic record system that was developed in the 1980s. An IHS spokesperson said \u201ca replacement is necessary\u201d but in the meantime, \u201cCovid-19 surveillance data is being collected manually\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHealth disparities are nice words for systematic racism \u2026 it\u2019s the residual effects of the founding of this country,\u201d social demographer Desi Rodriguez-Lonebear (Cheyenne) told the Guardian. </p> <p>But Rodriguez-Lonebear said it was not enough to just include Native Americans in demographic data; the data also needs to include tribal affiliation. For tribal governments, she said, \u201cbeing able to identify who your citizens are in these big data sets is so vital to being able to understand the impact of the virus on your tribe\u201d.</p> <p>Unlike states and counties, tribes cannot rely on healthcare systems to tell them when their citizens are sick or dying and must collect the data themselves. The Guardian asked 15 state and local health departments with high Native populations if they were collecting tribal affiliation. None reported doing so.</p> <p>\u201cWe wish we had the resources to drill down to the tribal affiliation; however, we are not able to at this point,\u201d a spokesperson for Maricopa county, which includes the city of Phoenix, said.</p> <p>The only public national coronavirus database reporting tribal affiliation is being run by the independent Native newspaper, Indian Country Today, whose team of 16 people has been adding the positive Covid-19 cases and deaths they can verify to a <a href=\"https://indiancountrytoday.com/news/indian-country-s-covid-19-syllabus-EiN-p5Q-XkW-smnaebJV6Q\">daily report on their website</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"632b89fefdb7a18f4ac0613dfe5b32a7974af277\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/632b89fefdb7a18f4ac0613dfe5b32a7974af277/0_0_2400_1578/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sophie Hunt gets a hug from her sister after Sophie\u2019s Covid-19 test in their grandparents\u2019 truck, outside of the Monument Valley Health Center in Oljato-Monument Valley in Utah.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"658\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sophie Hunt gets a hug from her sister after Sophie\u2019s Covid-19 test in their grandparents\u2019 truck, outside of the Monument Valley Health Center in Oljato-Monument Valley in Utah.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kristin Murphy/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOften researchers and legislators say there is no data\u201d on health issues affecting Indian country, said Jourdan Bennett-Begay (Navajo), ICT\u2019s Washington editor.

  "<p>Taylor Swift has disowned a new live album released under her name, calling it tasteless and \u201cshameless greed\u201d amid the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>The album, Live from Clear Channel Stripped 2008, was recorded when Swift was 18, around the release of her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/mar/06/taylor-swift-fearless-album-review\">Grammy-winning second album, Fearless</a>. The live album has been released by Big Machine, Swift\u2019s former label that was bought by music manager Scooter Braun from its founder, Scott Borchetta. Swift has frequently criticised Braun and Borchetta \u2013 leading Braun to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/22/scooter-braun-pleads-for-resolution-with-taylor-swift-following-death-threats\">allege death threats</a> from fans to his family \u2013 and is planning to rerecord and rerelease her six albums put out by Big Machine to regain some control over her back catalogue.</p> <p>In a post on Instagram, Swift said: \u201cThis release is not approved by me. It looks to me like Scooter Braun and his financial backers, 23 Capital, Alex Soros and the Soros family and the Carlyle Group have seen the latest balance sheets and realised that paying $330 MILLION wasn\u2019t exactly a wise choice and they need money.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cIn my opinion \u2026 Just another case of shameless greed in the time of coronavirus. So tasteless, but very transparent.\u201d</p> <p>Swift\u2019s criticism of Braun has a long history. After he bought Big Machine, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/30/taylor-swift-scooter-braun-tumblr-post\">Swift accused Braun</a> of \u201cincessant, manipulative\u201d bullying over the years via orchestrated feuds with his clients Kanye West and Justin Bieber, which Braun denied. She later claimed he was preventing her from performing her own music at US awards ceremony, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/15/taylor-swift-says-shes-being-banned-from-singing-her-old-hits-at-amas\">Braun also denied</a>.</p>",
  "<p>As I lingered, mask-free, by the pickles at Sainsbury\u2019s, it struck me that risking my life is now easier. Five weeks in, and I am weary of worrying. I am news-saturated, knackered and listless. I wanted, in that moment, to shop freely. \u201cMaybe I die, maybe I don\u2019t,\u201d I thought as I bought coleslaw raffishly. After five weeks in the house being obedient, a devil-may-careness has set in.<br><br>Perhaps I\u2019ll be one of those people who die doing something they love, I wondered, which until recently was an epitaph reserved only for vagabonds, Wall of Death stunt riders, wingsuiters and those folk who are hell-bent on keeping 20ft saltwater crocodiles as pets. \u201cWe all told her Colin wasn\u2019t her friend, but a 2,000lb opportunistic, hyper-carnivorous predator. But, hey, she died doing something she loved.\u201d<br><br>But risking your life, from now on, will be different. We\u2019re all going to have to get good and comfy with it; we cannot hide for ever. The findings on Covid-19 are hazy, and enough people already think: \u201cOh well, life must go on.\u201d Industry is itching to get going. The new world, as far as I can see, seems to come with the sort of disclaimer you see at a dodgy fun fair: \u201cAll amusement is at the patron\u2019s own risk.\u201d If you want to drink Pimm\u2019s in a sunny beer garden with friends, then off you should trot, if your nerve lets you. How about a beach picnic with \u2013 and I\u2019m being quite bold here \u2013 a reckless game of Swingball? You\u2019ll need a gang of fellow-minded nihilists and a strong sense of throwing caution to the wind. Summer fun will still be out there; there will be barbecues and maybe even the odd restaurant. But it will be followed by a new type of regret: the Covid-19 shame hangover. A tricky 10 days during which you\u2019ll wonder whether that cough is down to your choice to smoke an ill-advised Embassy Red, or your choice to share a karaoke mic with five other super-spreaders. Did your night out actually kill you? Will your final public words be: \u201cGuys, isn\u2019t that ball pit, um, a risk?\u201d<br><br>But I\u2019m jumping the gun. Right now, it feels risky, to me at least, to use one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/16/burger-king-kfc-and-pret-announce-limited-reopenings\">the 10 recently reopened branches of Pret A Manger</a>, even if they do strictly follow the guidelines and offer a brief taste of pre-Covid humdrum. Oh, Pret \u2026 A jambon beurre and a peach green tea. A crayfish salad, a Love Bar and a disappointing coffee. Pret was a thing I did almost subliminally, often mainly for a few minutes of downtime, sat quietly alone in the middle of dozens of strangers, sharing tiny tables, breathing each others\u2019 recycled air and scrolling mindlessly through our phones. I long to be mindless in public again.<br><br>But now Pret is back \u2013 very gently, sort of \u2013 as are some Nando\u2019s, and soon KFC, too, all very importantly now observing the guidelines. Except they\u2019re guidelines that no one important can really agree on. If you find the ones suggested on Sky News at midday too draconian, try the ones on the BBC at teatime, because they may be more affable. You can do this while making your own safety mask from an old T-shirt, the wearing of which in public is vitally important for safety, but also, apparently, futile and, if you think about it, might potentially increase your risk. Which is it? Who knows? No one, that\u2019s who. Now eat your Zinger Tower and shut up.<br><br>As the world throws up many more questions than answers, I\u2019ve found myself dreaming of Pizza Express dough balls. Not the food, as such, but all that it symbolises: friendship and silly, unplanned Fridays where everyone gets together at the last minute. I miss arriving at a busy table just as the first portion of dough balls is being delivered, getting slagged off (again) for being the one who is always late, and apologising (again) to Tom, who always gets there promptly. I miss bottles of warm red wine and four stories on the go at once as everyone fights to finish their opening anecdote, before giving up.</p> <p>I miss so much talking and no one finishing any story ever. I miss sloppy, occasionally sub-standard pizzas and endless laughing and saying we don\u2019t want pudding, then ordering some for sharing anyway. I miss standing outside in the street afterwards, tipsy, a little bit noisy, egging each other on to go to a pub, just for one, maybe more. And some people escaping, claiming they\u2019re tired, but then hugging and kissing and goodbyes and even more laughing. If I go home and die two weeks later, at least I\u2019ll have died doing something I loved.</p>",

This is Calla Wahlquist bringing you the main stories on Friday 24 April.</p> \n<h2>Aged care providers put on notice over restrictions</h2> \n<p>Scott Morrison has warned aged care providers to loosen restrictions or face stronger regulations that would prevent them from locking down residents without commonwealth approval. The prime minister said aged care providers had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/21/elective-surgery-restart-will-allow-government-to-wind-back-support-for-private-hospitals\">previously been told</a> not to restrict residents beyond the measures recommended by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, but despite that warning some homes were not allowing visitors and confining residents to their rooms even when no outbreak had taken place.'</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up to get this delivered as daily email newsletter</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Morrison said there were reasonable circumstances \u2013 such as the outbreak <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/some-australian-aged-care-homes-go-beyond-official-coronavirus-advice-with-lockdowns\">at Newmarch House aged care home in NSW, where five people have died</a> \u2013 in which to impose stronger restrictions to protect residents. \u201cBut more broadly, having people stuck in their rooms, not being able to be visited by their loved ones and carers and other support people, that\u2019s not OK,\u201d he said.</p> \n<h2>Testing expanded nationally</h2> \n<p>Every state and territory has now broadened its testing criteria, which is the first of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/the-exit-strategy-how-countries-around-the-world-are-preparing-for-life-after-covid-19\">three steps</a> that Morrison said needed to be in place before the national cabinet would consider lifting social distancing restrictions. The other two steps are improved contact tracing and a strengthened local response capability. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said arrangements for testing asymptomatic people in frontline occupations were well under way.</p> \n<p>It appears likely that restrictions on sport and recreation will be lifted first. The national cabinet on Friday began working on a set of national principles under which professional and community sporting clubs, and individual recreational pursuits, might be allowed to resume. The AFL has said it will announce its season return date next week, while the NRL is still aiming for 28 May.</p> \n<h2>Death toll rises to 79</h2> \n<p>Australia recorded just 13 new cases overnight, while the national death toll rose to 79. A 79-year-old woman, who was part of the cluster of cases in north-west Tasmania, died overnight; a passenger from the Artania cruise ship died in hospital in Western Australia; and a fifth resident at Sydney\u2019s Newmarch House aged care facility died on Friday. Health authorities in Victoria, where six new cases were recorded overnight, are investigating a new cluster at a private inpatient psychiatric facility in Melbourne. So far 14 people, including five patients, have tested positive to Covid-19 in relation to this outbreak.</p> \n<h2>Concerns about US access to tracking data</h2> \n<p>It will be illegal to access data collected by the proposed contact tracing app for the purpose of anything other than contact tracing, the federal government has said. The data will be housed in an Amazon Web Services server, located in Australia, raising concerns that the US government will be able to access the data because of laws allowing it to access data held by US companies.

  "<p>Donald Trump has stunned viewers by suggesting people could receive injections of disinfectant to cure the coronavirus, a notion one medical expert described as \u201cjaw-dropping\u201d.</p> \n<p>At Thursday\u2019s White House coronavirus taskforce briefing, the US president mused on new government research into how the virus reacts to different temperatures, climates and surfaces.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-31/\">Trump said</a>: \u201cAnd then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute! And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning. Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it would be interesting to check that. So, that, you\u2019re going to have to use medical doctors with. But it sounds interesting to me.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dr Deborah Birx, the taskforce response coordinator, remained silent. But social media erupted in outrage at the president, who has a record of defying science and also floated the idea of treating patients\u2019 bodies with ultraviolet (UV) light.</p> \n<p>Several doctors warned the public against injecting disinfectant or using UV light and a leading household cleaner manufacturer urged users not to inject it into their bodies.</p> \n<p>Reckitt Benckiser, the British-based maker of Dettol and Lysol, said in a <a href=\"https://link.axios.com/click/20120979.111210/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmIuY29tL21lZGlhL25ld3MvMjAyMC9hcHJpbC9pbXByb3Blci11c2Utb2YtZGlzaW5mZWN0YW50cy8_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXJfYXhpb3NhbSZzdHJlYW09dG9w/58c6e533a79328702e8b4bbfBa870d92f\">statement</a>: \u201cWe must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route).\u201d</p> \n<p>Political commentators joined the condemnation. Robert Reich, a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and a former labor secretary, tweeted: \u201cTrump\u2019s briefings are actively endangering the public\u2019s health. Boycott the propaganda. Listen to the experts. And please don\u2019t drink disinfectant.\u201d</p> \n<p>Walter Shaub, the former director of the Office of Government Ethics, added: \u201cIt is incomprehensible to me that a moron like this holds the highest office in the land and that there exist people stupid enough to think this is OK. I can\u2019t believe that in 2020 I have to caution anyone listening to the president that injecting disinfectant could kill you.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump was already facing a backlash over his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus-scientific-studies-research\">championing of hydroxychloroquine</a>, an anti-malaria drug, as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/hydroxychloroquine-trump-coronavirus-drug\">therapy for the coronavirus</a>, a quixotic effort amplified by the conservative network Fox News. Research has found no evidence that it is beneficial and a government vaccine expert has claimed he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/rick-bright-trump-hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus\">fired for limiting its use.</a></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/hydroxychloroquine-trump-coronavirus-drug\">Hydroxychloroquine: how an unproven drug became Trump\u2019s coronavirus 'miracle cure'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Undeterred, on Thursday Trump showcased an \u201cemerging result\u201d from Department of Homeland Security research that indicates coronavirus appears to weaken more quickly when exposed to sunlight, heat and humidity, raising hopes that it could become less contagious in summer months.</p> \n<p>Bill Bryan, the acting homeland security undersecretary for science and technology, said at the briefing: \u201cOur most striking observation to date is the powerful effect that solar light appears to have on killing the virus \u2013 both surfaces and in the air. We\u2019ve seen a similar effect with both temperature and humidity as well, where increasing the temperature and humidity or both is generally less favourable to the virus.\u201d</p> \n<p>Researchers found that the virus survives best indoors and in dry conditions, and loses potency when temperatures and humidity rise. Bryan said: \u201cThe virus dies the quickest in the presence of direct sunlight under these conditions.\u201d</p> \n<p>He showed a slide summarising the results of the experiment that were carried out at the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center. He also said tests had been carried out with disinfectants and isopropyl alcohol, specifically in saliva or in respiratory fluids.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd I can tell you that bleach will kill the virus in five minutes; isopropyl alcohol will kill the virus in 30 seconds, and that\u2019s with no manipulation, no rubbing \u2013 just spraying it on and letting it go. You rub it and it goes away even faster. We\u2019re also looking at other disinfectants, specifically looking at the Covid-19 virus in saliva.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fcba6d89643c2c0095044f7e6a6ce9a0d975e2af\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcba6d89643c2c0095044f7e6a6ce9a0d975e2af/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump prompted awkwardness when he asked if Dr Birx had heard of heat and light in relation to coronavirus. \u2018Not as a treatment,\u2019 she said.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump prompted awkwardness when he asked if Dr Birx had heard of heat and light in relation to coronavirus. \u2018Not as a treatment,\u2019 she said.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Trump seized on the findings to refer back to a claim he made on 14 February that warm weather might kill the virus, like common flu, noting that he had been criticised by the media. \u201cI think a lot of people are going to go outside, all of a sudden, people that didn\u2019t want to go outside,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>And he asked Bryan an extraordinary question: \u201cSo I asked Bill a question that probably some of you are thinking of, if you\u2019re totally into that world, which I find to be very interesting. So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous \u2013 whether it\u2019s ultraviolet or just very powerful light \u2013 and I think you said that that hasn\u2019t been checked, but you\u2019re going to test it.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd then I said, supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way, and I think you said you\u2019re going to test that too. It sounds interesting.\u201d</p> \n<p>Bryan responded: \u201cWe\u2019ll get to the right folks who could.\u201d</p> \n<p>UV rays are an invisible type of radiation that can penetrate and damage skin cells, and overexposure can cause skin cancer. How much sunlight would be needed to have an effect on the coronavirus is unknown. The virus has caused heavy death tolls in warm-weather areas such as Louisiana and Florida, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/singapore-million-migrant-workers-suffer-as-covid-19-surges-back\">Singapore has seen a recent surge in cases</a>.</p> \n<p>A Washington Post reporter asked if it was dangerous for Trump to make people think they would be safe by going outside in summer heat. The president turned to Bryan and said: \u201cI would like you to speak to the medical doctors to see if there\u2019s any way that you can apply light and heat to cure.</p> \n<p>\u201cMaybe you can, maybe you can\u2019t. Again, I say, maybe you can, maybe you can\u2019t. I\u2019m not a doctor.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a cringeworthy moment, he asked Birx if she had ever heard of heat and light in relation to the coronavirus. \u201cNot as a treatment,\u201d she said, explaining that the body responds to the virus with a fever.</p> \n<p>When the Post reporter pressed further, Trump retorted: \u201cI\u2019m the president and you\u2019re fake news \u2026 I\u2019m just here to present talent, I\u2019m here to present ideas.\u201d</p> \n<p>Experts questioned why the homeland security report had been promoted at the briefing. <a href=\"https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/ir2110\">Dr Irwin Redlener,</a> the director of the Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, told MSNBC: \u201cEverything that this scientist talked about from homeland security was basically incoherent, nonsensical, not really supported by evidence and really quite contrary to a lot of things that we do know about some of the things he was saying.</p> \n<p>\u201cFirst of all, people do get Covid, have been getting Covid in warm climates. Second of all, this issue with UV light is hypothetical, but also UV light can be very harmful and we did not hear anything resembling a balanced discussion of what the evidence is for and against UV light, but it\u2019s certainly not ready for prime time.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cThe very fact that the president actually asked somebody about what sounded like injecting disinfectants or isopropyl alcohol into the human body was kind of jaw-dropping.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>According to Deirdre Mask, \u201cmost households in the world don\u2019t have street addresses\u201d. That includes many parts of rural America. When Mask took a trip to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/west-virginia\">West Virginia</a> to find an acquaintance who doesn\u2019t have an address, she got lost: \u201cFor generations, people had navigated West Virginia in creative ways. Directions are delivered in paragraphs.\u201d The lack of an address can be a matter of life and death if you need an ambulance. Some drivers have resorted to asking people to listen out for the siren and to guide them by phone: \u201cGetting hotter? Getting closer?\u201d</p> <p>But giving people a street address is not simple. For a start, many don\u2019t want one. One farmer was outraged that his street was to be named after the banker who refused his grandfather a loan during the Great Depression. Workers setting up signs have been greeted by men with shotguns.</p> <p>Of course, addresses are not just there to help friends find you. They also allow the state to tax its citizens and the police to locate suspects. As Mask\u2019s book shows, the names and numbers of our streets are rooted in an Enlightenment project to control and quantify the state\u2019s subjects.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the US it took eight years for a street to be named after Martin Luther King Jr</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mexico City has at least 500 streets named after Emiliano Zapata, leader of their peasant revolution, and Russia more than 4,000 named after Lenin. In the US it took eight years for a street to be named after Martin Luther King Jr following his death. Mask, an African American lawyer and scholar, also describes the remarkable campaign by residents of Hollywood, Florida, to rename streets in their predominantly black community that were named after confederate generals, as are more than a thousand streets in the south. The new names were Liberty Street, Freedom Street and Hope Street.</p> <p>Mask\u2019s fascinating study is filled with insights into how addresses affect ordinary people around the world. She concludes the future may lie in GPS apps. In the end, despite the political associations and the effect on property values of street names (in Australia unusual names such as Wanke Road can knock 20% off values), Mask likes the controversies: \u201cArguments are what divide communities, but they are also what constitutes them <em>as</em> communities.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Address Book: What Street Addresses Reveal About Identity, Race, Wealth, and Power </em><em>is published by Profile.

  "<p>It must have seemed like a dream adventure: a two-week festival on a beach in Central America, camping out under the stars at night in what organisers called \u201cparadise on Earth\u201d.</p> <p>But because of the coronavirus outbreak, a group of 30 British workers and volunteers at the festival are stranded in a makeshift camp facing nonstop rain, a difficult relationship with the British embassy, and a sewage problem.</p> <p>The group were taking part in Tribal Gathering, a festival in Panama billed as \u201can amazing indigenous musical journey through time and space\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b04b92e57ab0a75daa415330a19efa381f78d292\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b04b92e57ab0a75daa415330a19efa381f78d292/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Local health workers check attendees of the Tribal Gathering festival rock in Cuango.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Local health workers check attendees of the Tribal Gathering festival rock in Cuango.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luis Acosta/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The festival was put in lockdown in mid-March after Panama declared a national emergency following its first coronavirus case. That meant many attendees missed their flights home. Some managed to leave the site and catch later flights, but others are still there.</p> <p>Peter Grant, from Somerset, who volunteered in the kitchens at the festival, praised the organisers\u2019 work to take care of them but said the Britons had received insufficient support from the British embassy and feared they could be stuck for months.</p> <p>\u201cWe were in limbo for about a week,\u201d Grant said. \u201cInitially the embassy offered buses to Panama City but we only had 12 hours to decide. We also had no guarantee of being able to get a flight. In the end some of those people got their flights cancelled while they were in the airport queue.\u201d</p> <p>He said people were not keen to leave the site without knowing what would happen to them next. \u201cAt the time the beach was the safer option for us, and we were never offered those buses again.\u201d</p> <p>At first, he said, the beach wasn\u2019t too bad. \u201cThe festival organisers were great. They were delivering food and provided us with big tents to shelter in. There was also running water.\u201d</p> <p>Then the weather changed. \u201cIt rained nonstop for a few days. There was no sewage system and disgusting water was pouring everywhere. Not only that, a few people have mental health issues and they started really struggling.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd037a356f00233391cb1bb9937845a261ad7962\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd037a356f00233391cb1bb9937845a261ad7962/0_288_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tents at the makeshift camp\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tents at the makeshift camp.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Hemmings</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said the group made repeated attempts to speak to the embassy. \u201cThey just kept giving us the same options every time, saying \u2018hold tight\u2019 or giving us expensive hotel options in Panama City with no means of getting there.

You need permits to move around and they don\u2019t really want Europeans going into the city.\u201d</p> <p>Hannah Bates, from Brighton, who was part of the production crew for the festival, was one of those who got on the buses sent by the embassy on 20 March. She is now staying in an Airbnb in Panama City and is quickly running out of money.</p> <p>\u201cThe embassy had written to the production manager saying they\u2019d send buses to collect British nationals to go to Panama City, and that this would be their last chance to get out of Panama,\u201d she said.</p> <p>In a video seen by the Guardian, a British embassy worker tells her and others on the bus: \u201cYou should be aware flights will be suspended internationally from Sunday [23 March].

This led me to create the #hairforhospitality challenge, which has raised about \u00a31,200 thus far for Hospitality Action\u2019s emergency relief fund by letting donors decide on how my look will change for the remainder of lockdown. The official reveal was Friday, and the new look speaks for itself. <em>Matthew Holy</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79d9fdd63db8acd16cae165d0d5784527d30a585\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79d9fdd63db8acd16cae165d0d5784527d30a585/0_403_3024_1771/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matthew Holy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"586\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matthew Holy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Holy/Guardian community</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018My wife decided to give me a mohawk\u2019</h2> <p>My wife decided to give me a mohawk as I have no jobs for the foreseeable future.

She was initially way too shy with the scissors, so I handed over my clippers, despite not having shaved my hair in 20 years! She went to town and I haven\u2019t felt this good-looking in months.

Likewise, the trick to cutting one\u2019s own hair is to stand in front of a mirror with your head upside down, let gravity splay out your hair, and then trim it like a bush so that it falls more evenly.

Short, buzz-cut hair is so freeing. I really recommend it. I\u2019m sure I was born with more hair than I have now.

One small problem was that the numbers on its scale do not correspond to those on a pro clipper. So the number four setting gave me a number two haircut.

Let them practise because they are in love with football\u201d.</p> <p>There has been regular contact since. They\u2019ve sent worksheets, encouraged the boys to look after their wellbeing and made a short film of all the fitness sessions that the boys designed and sent in via WhatsApp. And then there are those hour-long Friday morning Q&amp;A sessions, each watched by nearly 200 children. The first week they were able to question Michael Carrick; the second, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, whose Scando-Manc commitment to the academy sing-songed through each answer; then Giggs; and, on Friday, comes Marcus Rashford, a local boy who grew up on free school meals, and who in the past few weeks has helped to raise \u00a320m for FareShare, a charity aimed at relieving food poverty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89bfa4ff7f013203229c77e32433884e912f5bf3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89bfa4ff7f013203229c77e32433884e912f5bf3/195_595_3832_2299/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Academy head Nick Cox (left) with head of first-team development Nicky Butt.

Both have great youth setups but United is different. It is just so huge and has, in Cox\u2019s words, \u201can absolute commitment to youth which surpasses all others\u201d. Last December the club celebrated their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/13/manchester-united-academy-4000-squads-milestone-scott-mctominay\" title=\"\">4,000th consecutive game with an</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/13/manchester-united-academy-4000-squads-milestone-scott-mctominay\" title=\"\">academy player in their match-day squad</a>, a sequence going back 82 years.

It has nothing to do with the vats of cash swilling around at the top \u2013 though huge sums are ploughed into the academy \u2013 and everything to do with human relationships at ground level, supporting the boys and girls who are never happier than with a ball flicking, flicking, at their toes. Alongside United continuing to pay casual staff despite there being no games for them to steward, and City and United giving a joint donation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/21/united-and-city-donate-combined-100000-to-manchester-food-banks\" title=\"\">to Greater Manchester food banks</a>, it illustrates that nothing is simple; that Premier League football may be greedy and selfish, but it can also be life-enhancing and compassionate.</p> <p>It is quite possible, of course, that none of those boys hanging on to Giggs\u2019s every word as he advised young wingers, and admitted that Sir Alex Ferguson could be \u201ca scary man\u201d, will make it as a professional footballer.

  "<p>Black pools, long trenches and charred earth have become common sights in the fields of north-west Syria, signs of an informal oil economy that has developed during the war.</p> <p>Despite damaging both the environment and health, up to 5,000 backyard oil refineries, crucial to the livelihoods of besieged Syrians, have cropped up in recent years, identified through satellite imagery in <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/04/24/dying-to-keep-warm-oil-trade-and-makeshift-refining-in-north-west-syria/\">a report</a> by open source investigators Bellingcat.</p> <p>In and around the last remaining rebel-held areas, these refineries have provided fuel to a region where almost half the population has been displaced internally or from elsewhere in Syria.

Burning this fuel day in, day out raises a lot of concerns among locals,\u201d said Zwijnenburg.</p> <p>He said oil waste produced by these operations was increasingly turned into cooking coals, which heightens health risks because it involves scraping the waste from barrels used in the burning process.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very dirty job,\u201d said Syrian activist Wissam Zarqa. \u201c[A worker\u2019s] skin would become darkened all the time, not from lack of cleanness.

  "<p><strong>You began an 81-day confinement on 3 April 2011. What happened that day?<br></strong>That day, I woke up and prepared to go to the airport with my assistant Jennifer, who had begun working with me not long before. This was our first trip together and we were going to go to Taiwan to prepare for an exhibition opening later that autumn. Our flight was to Hong Kong where we would transfer to Taipei. <br> Many things happened in the days before the trip. I had been under surveillance and followed by secret police for years, but the days before the trip involved more frequent visits. There were all kinds of excuses: a fire safety check, residential registrations, many strange reasons that had not been used before. I could sense something was coming, but I could never have imagined what would happen.  They could have come to my home in Beijing to see me and take me away if they had wanted to. They could have come and questioned me at any time, but they never directly confronted me. When we approached the immigration checkpoint that day, I knew something was going to happen. A police officer took my passport and I saw the other police gathered in the hall begin moving toward me. Another police officer came and told me he had something to discuss. I followed him into another room. From there, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/apr/03/ai-weiwei-detained-chinese-police\">I was led to a car, a black hood was put over my head</a> and I was driven to an unknown area. That was the beginning of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/apr/17/ai-weiwei-protests-1001-chairs\">81 days of solitary confinement</a>.</p> <p><strong>How have you revisited the confinement in your own art?<br></strong>I created a few pieces related to the period of detention. There was <a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/article/ai-weiwei-13-works-to-know\">SACRED</a>, an installation consisting of six iron boxes with scale dioramas depicting my detention conditions. It showed in exact detail how I slept, walked, ate, was interrogated, washed and used the toilet. I also made <a href=\"https://aiweiwei.com/mixed-media/the-divine-comedy/index.html\">The Divine Comedy</a>, a heavy rock album that directly reflected this time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fa63426c6105bea8a4f61782832679aea4e44a01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa63426c6105bea8a4f61782832679aea4e44a01/0_0_4852_3235/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The scene inside one of six containers that comprise SACRED at the Royal Academy in London in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The scene inside one of six containers that comprise SACRED at the Royal Academy in London in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>With this play, your confinement became an artwork \u2013 how does that feel?<br></strong>When I heard of the play, I felt that it was created in the same spirit as my work at that time. I was trying to fight through all possible forms: artworks, online activities, interviews, happenings, photographs, videos. I would use whatever medium I could get. <br> What I have learned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/24/how-xi-jinping-became-networked-authoritarian-thanks-to-little-red-app\">living in this kind of authoritarian society</a> is that the struggle is often very difficult. Most of the time, your voice cannot be heard. There is no platform without censorship and tight police control. And even if you had a voice, very few people would be able to hear it. Those outside of China are too far away and nobody cares what they have to say. Those within China have the attention of a very small audience that shares the same feelings and can follow the argument. The arguments are not necessarily popular ones, either philosophically or aesthetically, and it takes some effort to follow along. <br> So when I heard at the time that a good theatre in London was putting on a play based on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/06/hanging-man-weiwei-martin-review\">book by Barnaby Martin</a>, who is someone I knew to be very alert and attentive to my situation, I was encouraged and felt like it became a part of my activity.</p> <p><strong>How did the confinement change you?<br></strong>This was a very harsh experience and it\u2019s difficult to grasp it, or even deal with it. It\u2019s not a common experience so it\u2019s hard to share with another. There is no existing vocabulary to illustrate a condition that requires a special kind of reality. Once it comes to a point when the authority cannot rationally communicate or have a clear exchange of ideas or when they cannot allow the argument, then the only thing they can do is to make you feel that rationality, moral judgment and the law no longer work. They must prove to you that nothing works except power itself. And that power is identified with incomprehensible treatment, which can be ridiculous and surreal, but you must follow every step and detail to get through it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ad0239ecca9b18f39450d1c79643b62a8f0dbe1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ad0239ecca9b18f39450d1c79643b62a8f0dbe1/0_0_4728_3148/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Benedict Wong as Ai Weiwei with David Lee-Jones, Richard Rees and Andrew Leung in #aiww: The Arrest of Ai WeiWei by Howard Brenton at Hampstead theatre in 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Benedict Wong as Ai Weiwei with David Lee-Jones, Richard Rees and Andrew Leung in #aiww: The Arrest of Ai WeiWei by Howard Brenton at Hampstead theatre in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The play\u2019s title includes the hashtag #aiww.

Without social media, \u201cAi Weiwei\u201d simply does not exist. I live by social media. In a religious sense, it\u2019s not unlike the biblical reference to \u201cthe way, the truth, and the life\u201d.</p> <p><strong>In the play, the interrogators accuse you of being a fraud and a conman. Did this happen \u2013 and does it reflect any kind of internal criticism you may have about your art and the marketplace?<br></strong>It\u2019s quite strange. The interrogators <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/mar/22/ai-weiwei-an-artist-must-be-an-activist\">never believed that what I did could be called art</a>. They could not believe that something I took could be called art, or that something I dropped could be called art, or an action on the internet or pointing my middle finger toward a monument could be called art. They thought I was famous because I was paid by western anti-China forces. I do not blame them. I don\u2019t care whether my work is called art or not. I am an artist because I have no other job; it is not that I like the title very much. It is the only title where you don\u2019t have to do very much and no one will question it because people don\u2019t understand art anyway. I enjoy the liberty of being someone who is doing nothing practical. At the same time, in the west, including the art world, they think my work isn\u2019t \u201cserious\u201d. I guess it is because I am not playing the game in the same way they are playing it, or my voice is different from their way of singing. This part I enjoy even more. If I have to call myself an artist, I would rather be different from the others.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"655fc0b351856f6cba8abd67c48c79fe7d52059d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/655fc0b351856f6cba8abd67c48c79fe7d52059d/0_299_2728_3097/881.jpg\" alt=\"Benedict Wong as Ai Weiwei in the play.\" width=\"881\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Benedict Wong as Ai Weiwei in the play.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Your father was imprisoned \u2013 did you find strength through his experience during these 81 days?<br></strong>At the beginning of my detention, I was so proud of myself. I matched my father\u2019s experience from 80 years ago when he was imprisoned by the Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) for political subversion. I was told my crime was subversion against the state. <br> Before I was detained, I was jealous of my father for having been imprisoned. Having grown up in this communist society, I was supposed to be a part of the second revolutionary generation. Having learned everything from Chairman Mao\u2019s education, there was no chance for me to be a criminal. That was true until I made arguments about the lawfulness of the existing party. I became the ultimate enemy of the established power, but still without a crime. They don\u2019t have to like me, but I did not think they would put me in jail. Once that was achieved, I kind of felt happy because it gave me an opportunity to argue my reasoning with them face to face.</p> <p>Before the arrest, confrontations were never direct because they did not want to have any argument. First, they don\u2019t think you are entitled to an argument and, second, they are incapable of making an argument. I had tried to initiate the argument for years on the internet. It became my own game. No one was answering me and therefore the argument couldn\u2019t go further. I was fighting against an invisible enemy, which is everywhere but nowhere at the same time. So when it did happen, I thought it was wonderful. We are sitting face to face, two metres across, looking at each other. You ask a question and I answer. I felt some sense of power and usefulness in being confronted directly.</p> <p><strong>What advice do you have for artists who are struggling financially and spiritually at this time of lockdown?<br></strong>Give up art. Do something which can bring home bread and soap. Rob a bank, but do not get caught.</p> <p><strong>There is a lengthy discussion in the play about how best to prepare Beijing noodles. What is your preferred method?<br></strong>You need to watch the noodles cook, not for too long or too short. It is really dependent on what kind of sauce you are cooking with.

  "<p>Most of us in Emilia-Romagna, in northern Italy, remember the weekend of 22 February very clearly. To begin with there were just rumours \u2013 phone calls and messages flying around between friends \u2013 but then it was confirmed: all schools in the region were going to close for a week.</p> <p>The decision was, in many ways, shocking. At that time, there had only been three deaths from Covid-19 in Italy, and only 152 reported infections. It seemed strange that education was the first social activity to be sacrificed. I guessed it was because it wasn\u2019t perceived to be economically productive. Nothing else was closing: football grounds, bars, shops and ski resorts were still open for business, and no schools in any other European country had closed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/15/italy-home-schooling-coronavirus-pandemic-podcast\">Italian lessons: what we've learned from two months of home schooling \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Still, to our three kids \u2013 Benny (15), Emma (13) and Leo (9) \u2013 the idea of a week off seemed like bliss. We had moved back to Parma from the UK three years earlier, and by comparison with the UK, education here seemed relentless. Many pupils go to school six days a week and there are no half-term holidays. But my wife, Francesca, who is Italian, and I were both worried. She works with Syrian refugees, which isn\u2019t a job you can suddenly drop, and I had just been offered a 9-to-5 job, after 21 years of being freelance. We, like all our friends, suddenly had an acute childcare crisis.</p> <p>The announcement had been so sudden that schools had few plans or resources in place to teach remotely. Italy spends a lot less on education than almost every other western country. <a href=\"https://data.oecd.org/eduresource/education-spending.htm\" title=\"\">Spending</a> per student (from primary school to university) equates to $8,966 per annum, compared to $11,028 in the UK and $11,502 in Sweden. The under-investment is so serious that in December 2019, the education minister, Lorenzo Fioramonti, resigned in protest.</p> <p>Nor did many Italian teachers seem to know how to approach this new world in which they found themselves. There is minimal teacher-training in Italy. University graduates are often thrown into a classroom without any knowledge of pedagogic theories or practical experience. Inspections are almost unheard of. The result is that Italian education is, at its worst, particularly conservative and condescending: the pupil is seen as an empty vessel to be filled with knowledge that is regurgitated in exams.</p> <p>Because of that lack of money, and because, <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/education/education-at-a-glance/EAG2019_CN_ITA.pdf\" title=\"\">according to the OECD</a>, Italy has the oldest teachers in the world \u2013 59% are over 50 \u2013 Italian schools are heavily analogue. Kids carry a dozen books to and from school every day in massive backpacks, like Obelix and his rock, which did not seem like a promising basis for remote learning.</p> <p>But if Italian schools weren\u2019t perfect, they were surely better than nothing. The idea that we now had to recreate formal education within the narrow walls of a city flat with no garden was daunting. We lacked the time, energy or even knowledge to replace their teachers. Nor, the kids made it clear, did they even want us to try.</p> <p>Parents and teachers across the country had to scramble to devise ways continue our children\u2019s learning. But slowly \u2013 over the course of two months \u2013 something rather unexpected happened. As we started to ponder how this experiment of home schooling could best be delivered, it began to feel as if it was us, the parents and teachers, as much as the pupils, who were being educated.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The first week off school was the lull before the storm. It genuinely felt like a holiday. Being pragmatic and slightly puritan, we don\u2019t let the kids watch TV, or ourselves drink alcohol, on weekdays. When it was announced that school was closed, we lifted the rules. On 1 March, another week of school closures was announced, so we went up to the mountains, half an hour outside the city, to plant trees and play cards. On 4 March, a new government decree announced that every school in Italy would be suspended the following day.</p> <p>In those early days it was all fun. I left the children spelling tests under their plates or pillows, and if they wanted to watch TV they had to learn elements of the periodic table or the bones of the human skeleton or how to tie knots. It felt as if we were, finally, the right side of that ancient Roman dichotomy of \u201c<em>otium-negotium</em>\u201d, an idea to which Italians occasionally refer. Otium was the time of creative repose when you were able to freewheel and follow your fancies \u2013 unlike negotium, which was all about business and the practical side of life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"44933dfd996e6d79fcbe92b6a7498173a58d3a29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44933dfd996e6d79fcbe92b6a7498173a58d3a29/0_1589_1984_2479/800.jpg\" alt=\"Tobias Jones and family at home in Parma\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tobias Jones and family at home in Parma.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tobias Jones</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We had a few advantages, I suppose. The ages of our kids mean that there are no tantrums at one end, and no alcohol or boyfriend issues at the other. We enjoy just hanging out together. I\u2019ve also spent much of my life teaching. I\u2019ve taught everywhere from primary schools to prisons and universities. For years, at home, we\u2019ve had mealtime quizzes. One Christmas, Benny even gifted the family three bells of the kind they have in hotel receptions so that we could truly have \u201cfingers on buzzers\u201d.</p> <p>The few educational theories I have come from the British psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott, who believed that play is the path to a child\u2019s wholeness and wellbeing. Games give children the chance to make decisions for themselves and provide an opportunity for spontaneity, fun, deceit and calculation. So for those first two weeks we played incessantly: <em>perudo</em> (\u201cliars\u2019 dice\u201d), blackjack, euchre, backgammon and epic table-tennis tournaments with various handicaps (playing left-handed or subtracting your age from your score). The kids weren\u2019t learning much, but at least poor old Leo was learning to be a good loser.</p> <p>Being the youngest, he needed some fun, and since at this point his class had as yet no lessons organised, I asked his teacher if we could make 10-minute English lessons for his classmates. The aim was as much to cheer them up as to learn English. We would wear wigs and teach his peers the English names for body parts by sawing them off and using lots of fake blood. We taught grammar through declining lavatorial verbs. Emma would edit the videos and we would send them to the class WhatsApp group, which had, until now, been a basic tool for school admin and parental gossip.</p> <p>Despite all those good intentions, it was hard not to feel inadequate, even anxious. Well-meaning messages were circulating among parents about which museums, theatres, aquariums and zoos had opened their virtual doors. Many were posting pictures of their well-behaved children clicking their way through the Guggenheim, while ours were watching House on Netflix. We quickly felt defeated by the sheer volume of offerings, and guilty that we weren\u2019t sharing these cultural delights with our children.</p> <p>The following weekend, on 8 March, the government announced that the whole of Emilia-Romagna (plus Lombardy and the Veneto) was to be placed in lockdown, and that schools would be closed for at least another month. Three days later, on 11 March, the entire country went into full lockdown.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>We were slowly realising how dark things were becoming. On 12 March, we passed 1,000 nationwide deaths, and only four days later passed 2,000. There was defiance and denial as we sang on balconies and people hung out bedsheets with the wrong-headed slogan \u201candr\u00e0 tutto bene\u201d (\u201cit\u2019ll all be fine\u201d), but the mood was turning as the death toll continued to rise.</p> <p>It was at this point that teachers dumped a load of homework on their pupils. Having had a fortnight to plan how to teach through the crisis, many decided that the best way was to send out entire chapters of books for children to learn, and hundreds of pages of exercises to complete. After a fortnight of freedom, pupils were now overloaded.</p> <p>The other thing that changed was that my new job started. For the first time this century, I had bosses and meetings and responsibilities. It brought to an abrupt end my educational clowning. Suddenly no one in the family had much spare time and nor, it seemed, such good cheer.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The closing of all Italy\u2019s schools meant teachers found themselves having to invent a new kind of classroom from scratch. There were no ministerial guidelines or approved websites. \u201cThe entirety of this new form of online teaching,\u201d said Daniele Martino, a middle-school teacher in Turin, \u201cwas created by us teachers at the last minute.\u201d</p> <p>At the beginning, it was chaotic. There was little coordination between different teachers within the same schools, let alone across different schools, and parents reported finding themselves boggled by a vast array of IT platforms: Meet, Classroom, Zoom, Jitsi, Edmodo. The problem wasn\u2019t only that sites and servers crashed as the country\u2019s almost 8 million students all logged on. Many kids couldn\u2019t connect at all.</p> <p>The Digital Economy and Society Index <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/scoreboard/italy\" title=\"\">rates Italy</a> 24 out of 28 European countries in its \u201cdigitalisation index\u201d, and last year Italy\u2019s national statistics agency, Istat, reported that 23.9% of Italian families have no access to the internet. As one teacher said to me: \u201cWe\u2019ve discovered how democratic pencil-and-paper is.\u201d The attempt by many teachers to get less-privileged students the necessary laptops and internet connections is one of the untold stories of this crisis. By 19 March, the ministry of education claimed to have distributed 46,152 tablets throughout the country. Since then, an emergency budget has created a \u20ac70m fund for providing computers to those without. Even if the necessary hardware is distributed, one special educational needs teacher told me that online classes just don\u2019t work for children who need bespoke lessons: \u201cThose who are already doing well at school are now doing even better, but those who were struggling are just falling further behind.\u201d</p> <p>At the start, I got the sense that no one really knew how to do what was becoming known as \u201cDAD\u201d \u2013 <em>didattica a distanza,</em> or long-distance learning. When teachers were struggling with IT, it was often their pupils who came to the rescue. \u201cI have an exceptional digital consultant\u201d, said Claudio Dionesalvi, a literature teacher in Calabria. \u201cHe\u2019s 11, and is one of my students. He\u2019s like a junior version of Mr Wolf in Pulp Fiction.\u201d</p> <p>The teacher-pupil balance also shifted. In an online classroom, if pupils aren\u2019t interested or motivated, they can hide far more easily. They can feign technological issues, freeze the camera, mute the microphone. Around this time, I did a few online lessons for various schools and saw the problem close up: when the pupils weren\u2019t engaged they would drift away and, not having them there in front of you, you couldn\u2019t bring them back into the circle.</p> <p>Teachers were having to learn new ways to draw their students out. \u201cI could no longer do the classic head-on, knowledge-passing lesson,\u201d said Betta Salvini, a history teacher in Parma. \u201cI now involve them all the time, I turn the lesson upside down so that they are the protagonists, so that I hear their voices.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"32cdcaa09ac37be869564b95a2191de70d286b07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32cdcaa09ac37be869564b95a2191de70d286b07/0_73_3072_1844/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two students doing schoolwork at home in Genova, Italy in March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two students doing schoolwork at home in Genova, Italy in March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luca Zennaro/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But school was also being reinvented because Italy\u2019s traditional educational stick had been removed. Usually pupils are given many tests each month and if, at the end of the year, their average score is insufficient, they\u2019re <em>bocciato</em> \u2013 failed \u2013 and have to repeat the year. Now, teachers quickly realised there was no way to stop students cheating in tests. When someone is in their bedroom, and all you can see is their face, you have no idea if they have the book open on their lap, or are messaging friends or Googling the answer.</p> <p>Traditionalist teachers were beside themselves. One parent in Umbria told me how a teacher stormed out of the virtual classroom when she discovered how many pupils were cheating. Then the new education minister, Lucia Azzolina, suggested that in the circumstances, no pupils would be sent back to repeat the year again. Between the cheating and the automatic promotion to the next school year, teachers who needed a big stick suddenly found themselves disarmed.</p> <p>\u201cMany of my colleagues are really struggling\u201d, said Riccardo Giannitrapani, a maths teacher in a secondary school in Udine. These two months, he told me, have been more about a re-education of teachers than of pupils. \u201cBefore, we used to discuss students in meetings by giving them numbers, even down to decimal points \u2013 5.4, 5.5.\u201d These marks, he said, became an end in themselves, creating acute anxiety among not only the children, but also their parents.</p> <p>There has always been a battle in Italy between hardliners and child-centred reformers such as Maria <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2017/jun/15/teachers-as-guides-inside-the-uks-first-montessori-secondary-school\" title=\"\">Montessori</a>. It now seemed as if progressives had the upper hand. Salvatore Giuliano, a headteacher in Brindisi and a former deputy education minister, told me: \u201cA child of 15 has far more creativity than we have. Every time you give them the freedom and tools to create something, they will astonish you.\u201d Giuliano described some memorable student-led presentations he has seen in recent weeks. His favourite was an extended family \u2013 parents, siblings and grandparents \u2013 all dressed up as the planets and moving around the room.</p> <p>Many teachers have had to soften their approach, to take into account what their pupils were going through. \u201cSome of them have lost a grandparent\u201d, said Paola Lante, a primary-school teacher in Milan. \u201cTheir parents are losing their jobs or are fighting at home. At the end of the day, a teacher has to be a steadying influence, a social worker and a psychologist.\u201d</p> <p>At the beginning of the lockdown, Giannitrapani, the maths teacher in Udine, published an open letter to his pupils saying that he shouldn\u2019t be the one overloading them, but vice versa \u2013 they should be bombarding him with their questions. Sara Scotellaro, in Naples, has 120 pupils in various classes: \u201cThey no longer have a timetable and you have to be constantly available\u201d, she said. \u201cThey have this need to be immediately reassured \u2013 that their work has been received, that it\u2019s OK, that you\u2019re happy with them.\u201d</p> <p>That fluidity of boundaries has had advantages and disadvantages. In video lessons some pupils have found it embarrassing to share their personal spaces \u2013 their bedrooms and, in the background, even their embarrassing parents. Many teachers describe seeing a new side to their students. \u201cThere\u2019s no longer the intimidation of the pack,\u201d said one teacher, \u201cand so they\u2019re bringing out what they really know. I\u2019ve got a 13-year-old, the son of two ex-offenders, who has produced some diaries of extraordinary depth.\u201d Lante told me about a very timid student who never speaks in class but who, it only now emerges, is exceptional at languages. \u201cIt makes you understand\u201d, said Lante, \u201cthat we need a very varied form of education\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>By the third week of March, after a month with no school, Francesca and I were also beginning to see our children in a new light. Like most kids, they\u2019re monosyllabic when describing their days at school \u2013 \u201cfine\u201d usually does it. Now, as lessons were literally taking place in the kitchen, we were unexpectedly in the classroom with them. We could see what was going on.</p> <p>It was both painful and funny. We realised that one of our children, exuberant and confident at home, often froze when asked a question in class. Another, usually conscientious and honest, was asked by her teacher to show her artwork. Because it hadn\u2019t turned out too well, she held up her drawing up against the window, and held the painting she was supposed to have copied behind it, so it showed through behind her own. That mini-deceit made her work look rather sophisticated.</p> <p>Another consequence of lessons taking place at home was that the greatest problem in schools \u2013 boisterous disturbances \u2013 suddenly subsided. One of our children has a class that is usually very noisy: the kids misbehave and the teacher yells, and soon everyone is shouting over each other. Now, with the children subdued by their parents\u2019 presence, and the teacher aware that parents could be listening, there was a new-found calm to the lessons and, we thought, a genuine warmth to the encounters.</p> <p>But there was no timetable to our children\u2019s lessons. There were odd hours here and there, sometimes in the early morning, sometimes mid-afternoon. Our elderly laptops and wifi were often inadequate, and so the only working devices were passed around. There wasn\u2019t a lot of rhythm or relaxation to our day. Francesca and I were still trying to take up a lot of slack, but as March turned into April, our initial energy had subsided.</p> <p>We had passed 10,000, then 15,000 deaths from Covid-19. Even though the kids had enough spare time to be habitually bored, they were no longer cleaning the house or doing their daily learning tasks. Spelling tests and fitness regimes were forgotten. They seemed to have become \u2013 if not agoraphobic \u2013 certainly \u201cagora-meh\u201d. They wouldn\u2019t even walk around the block. They were getting up later each day, and even when vertical, it became hard to persuade them to get out of pyjamas.</p> <p>As often happens when you stop doing something, you suddenly wonder why you were doing it in the first place. Benny, who has been obsessive about ballet all her life and attends a dance academy, entered a profound crisis. She said she wanted to stop dancing altogether. Even Leo, a football fanatic, barely mentioned or played with a football any more. It felt as if their passions had evaporated somehow.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard, as a parent, not to be frustrated, especially if \u2013 as a writer \u2013 you regret that they never read books. Every time I emerged from my office, I would see them all on their screens, headphones on. Lessons had become indistinguishable from down-time. For all the idealism about digital learning, it seemed extraordinarily passive to me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c38a342df3198dc259ecd7c06032ab24d98879b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c38a342df3198dc259ecd7c06032ab24d98879b6/0_0_7360_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Online teaching in Trieste in March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Online teaching in Trieste in March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NurPhoto via Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I tried to take things in hand. Mealtimes were raucous because they had so much pent-up energy, so I thought \u201cif they\u2019re not going to read, I\u2019ll read to them\u201d. I would bring a book to table, not realising that I was becoming just like one of the conservative teachers I had always scorned, force-feeding them my passions and using knowledge to sedate and subdue. They would snigger and scoff. \u201cI just don\u2019t get poetry,\u201d Emma grumbled.</p> <p>Fortunately they have a wiser mother. We have no garden, but four balconies, and as spring came on, Francesca was planting and weeding. The children were drawn to the gardening, perhaps because it was everything their schooling isn\u2019t \u2013 outdoors and manual. Emma propagated her succulents and so needed more shelf space, and went to the garage to do some carpentry. They began sewing, and cooking cappelletti, croissants and \u2013 their much-missed English snack \u2013 digestive biscuits.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to know how much it was more to do with psychology or spare time, but they all began rearranging their bedrooms, moving beds and desks. It was as if they were rearranging their internal and external furniture. Photographs, pictures and books were culled, others were added. They asked for new haircuts. Francesca and I watched it all and tried to work out ways to keep bringing them out of both their closed bedrooms and their private worlds.</p> <p>I changed my approach. I know that theatricality is sometimes helpful in teaching, so one evening, as I read a poem, I put a small shiny box on the table. They pretended to listen, but were all watching that box, wondering what the game was. I had chosen to read Seamus Heaney\u2019s Digging. It\u2019s a poem about how we look up to, and down on, our parents. It\u2019s about the difficulty of a writer feeling worthy of agricultural ancestors because the pen is nothing compared with the depth of a spade. But it\u2019s also about the need for children to go their own way and not, perhaps, feel unworthy. When I had finished, I just passed them the box. Inside I had cut up all the words of the poem. \u201cGo on then,\u201d I said, \u201cwrite it your way.\u201d</p> <p>Suddenly they were excited about poetry. They snatched words from each other, tried them out here and there. As they laughed, the slim pieces of paper flew around the table. With its farmyard diction \u2013 \u201csquelch\u201d, \u201cslap\u201d, \u201crump\u201d \u2013 the poem now seemed earthy rather than erudite. Instead of being told to admire a Grecian urn, they now had the clay in their hands.</p> <p>As they found their new hybrid role of being both pupils and teachers, we said they could award themselves marks both for content (a letter) and effort (a number). It was really, of course, just a way to show them that marks aren\u2019t about approval (external) but honesty (internal).</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The more you look at the educational conundrum in lockdown Italy, the more you see everyone\u2019s vulnerabilities. Students have always felt fretful because of their weekly tests and the stigma of being held back a year. But now many teachers feel insecure, too: not just because education seems like the last priority of government, but because they are scared of digitalised learning and fear being replaced by screens.</p> <p>Even those who relish the technology, like the Calabrian teacher Claudio Dionesalvi, are concerned: \u201cDistance-learning is a strange video game,\u201d he said, \u201cbut in the end it\u2019s a torture. A teacher can\u2019t be holed up in front of a screen. They risk becoming two-dimensional \u2013 an artificial TV personality.\u201d</p> <p>Many parents are anxious, not just because their children are losing out on formative months of learning, but also because \u2013 without those marks \u2013 they have no measure of their offspring\u2019s progress. Chiara Esposito, a middle-school teacher, told me \u201cparents are the most conservative element in the school ecosystem. They become paranoid if their child isn\u2019t \u2018an eight\u2019 or hasn\u2019t completed the set book. They\u2019re the ones we really need to educate.\u201d</p> <p>Surprisingly, even the education technology firms promoting digital learning platforms to schools feel apprehensive. Lorenzo Benussi is the chief innovation officer of the Fondazione per la Scuola della Compagnia di San Paolo, which promotes inclusivity and creativity in education, and a former technical adviser to the minister of education. He is concerned that teachers are using new tech to reproduce the same old teaching methods, instead of grasping this opportunity for a completely new kind of teaching. \u201cWhen all this talk about digital learning began back in March,\u201d he said, \u201cI was very, very worried, because it\u2019s not about technology. Technology is just a means. Its effectiveness depends entirely on your didactic approach.\u201d</p> <p>Edoardo Montenegro from Betwyll, which is launching a new social reading app with educational publisher Pearson for Italian schools in September, says something very similar: \u201cA WhatsApp video call or a Zoom meeting isn\u2019t digital learning. Those encounters can be just as frontal and rhetorical as an old-style professorial lesson.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/21/disney-plus-streaming-coronavirus-lockdown-feasting-on-fantasy\">\u2018Feasting on fantasy\u2019: my month of extreme immersion in Disney+</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No one knows when formal schooling will resume, and everyone feels uncertain of what their role will be when it does. But uncertainty is, according to the great educationalist Loris Malaguzzi, actually a vital ingredient for inclusive, collegiate learning. Only \u201ca willingness to question all your own abilities and knowledge\u201d, he said in 1992, two years before his death, leads to humility and listening. That, he said, \u201cis how we educate each other together.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s exactly two months since the schools closed in Emilia-Romagna. And to us, in our city apartment, it does feel as if, in the gentle argy-bargy of family life, we\u2019ve been educating each other. Maybe it would have happened anyway, but it\u2019s changed how we see ourselves. The girl destined to be a ballerina seems to be mourning the end of that dream. The perfectionist has glimpsed a goal that\u2019s deeper than marks out of 10. The boy who seemed riotous has been revealed as nervously studious. The teacher has become an accompanist and the gardener our guide.

  "<p>Lucinda Williams has been sleep-talking more than usual. One night last week, she dreamed that Mormons invaded her house, converted her friends and stole her possessions. That wasn\u2019t the issue: \u201cThey were all sitting next to each other, and I said: \u2018Don\u2019t you understand, you\u2019re supposed to be quarantined!\u2019\u201d Williams laughs, her laconic outlaw baritone spilling into a surprising giggle. Her husband and manager, Tom Overby, told her she had grown agitated in her sleep. She thinks it came from the nightly TV marathons that have become their new lockdown routine, staying up until 5am watching the Jewish drama <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81019069\">Unorthodox</a>, \u201conly in my dream they came out as Mormons\u201d.</p> <p>Wiggy dreams are a quarantine staple, but Williams has had a lot to process lately. She and Overby only recently moved to Nashville and don\u2019t yet have any furniture. No sooner had they arrived than a tornado hit the city, taking part of their roof with it. Then coronavirus killed two old friends: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/08/hal-willner-music-producer-and-snl-supervisor-dies-aged-64\">Hal Willner</a>, who produced Williams\u2019s 2007 album, West, and the country musician <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/08/john-prine-us-folk-and-country-songwriter-dies-aged-73\">John Prine</a>. She last saw Prine in November when she played his festival in the Dominican Republic. \u201cIt\u2019s been insane,\u201d she says in disbelief, calling from her home.</p> <p>Now aged 67, Williams has written often about death in her 40-year career: songs such as Pineola, Sweet Old World, Lake Charles and Drunken Angel have become alt-country classics, often depicting complex men who might otherwise easily be reduced to caricature. That familiarity doesn\u2019t soften the losses. \u201cI think that\u2019s why I write about death,\u201d she says, her gorgeous accent kneading every vowel, \u201cbecause it\u2019s so hard to deal with.\u201d The subject features less on her new album, <a href=\"https://www.allmusic.com/album/good-souls-better-angels-mw0003357520\">Good Souls Better Angels</a>, although you could say it deals with worse fates: shame, depression, the uncanny horror of watching despots crush the values you hold dear.</p> <p>Williams\u2019s career renaissance started with 2014\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/music/down-where-the-spirit-meets-the-bone/lucinda-williams\">Down Where the Spirit Meets the Bone</a>, yet Good Souls is yet another cut above: flinty garage blues that foregrounds the punk spirit Rough Trade recognised when the British label elevated her from relative obscurity with her 1988 self-titled third album. Now releasing her first collection of what she calls \u201ctopical\u201d songs, she has been baffled by critics asking why she wrote them (\u201cBecause I\u2019m frustrated and angry\u201d), or remarking on how \u201cprophetic\u201d Bad News Blues and Man Without a Soul (namely Trump) feel, mid-pandemic. Williams isn\u2019t psychic, just attuned to injustice: she keeps suitcases of unused lyrics dating back to the 1970s and weaves them through her writing. \u201cThere\u2019s always been something going on in this country to rebel against and be pissed off about,\u201d she says.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=272voTjeHy4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/272voTjeHy4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Still, Williams says Trump is \u201cdifferent than anything I\u2019ve ever experienced in my entire lifetime\u201d. She knew \u201call the racism and the intolerance and the bigotry\u201d that he represents was part of the American psyche, \u201cbut I thought it had been suppressed to some degree, or that we had some control over it\u201d. Trump gave people of that mindset \u201cpermission in a subliminal way to come on out of the closet,\u201d she says. \u201c\u2018You can hate, you can get your guns and your anger.\u2019\u201d She\u2019s reeling from discovering, via a fractious Facebook thread about Man Without a Soul, that she has fans who are Trump supporters. \u201cThat\u2019s just incongruous,\u201d she says. \u201cHow can those things go together?\u201d Their comments kept her awake one night, although she ultimately found them validating. \u201cIt feels good to rebel. To tell you the honest truth, I don\u2019t mind pushing people\u2019s buttons, y\u2019know? I like to get a reaction out of people.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m not trying to say: \u2018Poor Ryan, he was all misunderstood.\u2019 I\u2019m just taking the situation and turning it into a song</p> <footer> <cite>Lucinda Williams</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Williams is no cheap rabble-rouser: it is her insistence on compassion and complexity that is provocative. There is pity even in Man Without a Soul. On the new song Wakin\u2019 Up, she reflects on an abusive relationship she was in around 2003. \u201cPulled the kitchen chair out from under me / He pulled my hair and then he kicks me / Next thing I swear, he wants to kiss on me,\u201d she rasps over choppy guitar. \u201cI used to judge women who were in these abusive, horrible relationships,\u201d she admits. \u201cAnd now here I was in the same situation. You just kinda numb yourself. It\u2019s easy when you love the person.\u201d Drunk on whiskey, that boyfriend would fly into violent rages that he forgot the next day. Then he started shooting heroin and cocaine. \u201cIt just got worse and worse until one night, he actually said: \u2018You need to get out.\u2019 He snapped-to long enough to realise what he was doing. So I totally understand the whole battered-woman syndrome; it\u2019s not black and white.\u201d</p> <p>That perspective fuels Shadows &amp; Doubts, a song billed in publicity as confronting \u201cour quick-to-judge, social-media-led society\u201d. I ask Williams if she had a specific situation in mind. For the first time, she is hesitant, outlining a situation whereby a male celebrity that she knows was accused of sexual harassment, but insisting the song should be \u201cmore universal or open to interpretation\u201d. I am surprised that she\u2019s surprised when I guess correctly that it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/14/the-ryan-adams-allegations-are-the-tip-of-an-indie-music-iceberg\">Ryan Adams</a>: he played on her 2001 album Essence and she wrote about his troubles \u2013 well documented before last year\u2019s accusations of sexual harassment (which he denies) \u2013 on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HqOIri7o8Q\">Little Rock Star</a>, from 2008\u2019s Little Honey.</p> <p>\u201cLook, I know Ryan, and I know he\u2019s fucked up a lot of things,\u201d she says plainly. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those people who you can love but he can also piss you off. God knows he\u2019s made enough mistakes.\u201d She says the song is not about the sexual allegations. \u201cThis is looking at somebody who basically fucked things up and trying to deal with seeing that person in that place but still being concerned about them. I still love Ryan. Do I agree with what he did? No. I\u2019m not trying to say: \u2018Oh, poor Ryan, he was all misunderstood.\u2019 I\u2019m just taking the situation and turning it into a song, but I think you can apply it to different things. I don\u2019t want this to seem like I\u2019m completely defending his actions.\u201d</p> <p>She is aghast that I might name him when she didn\u2019t, but I explain that I don\u2019t think her position is unreasonable: justice requires rehabilitation, even for the likes of Harvey Weinstein. \u201cWell, I agree,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the other thing is, it\u2019s an illness. It\u2019s very taboo but it\u2019s another form of mental illness, and they need help.\u201d We talk about how the social urge to shame can be rooted in fear of our own worst instincts, prompting Williams to raise her love of Freud. \u201cWe all have the ability to go over the edge,\u201d she says. \u201cMy father used to describe it, like when a real close friend of the family committed suicide, as: we\u2019re all standing around the edge of this deep, dark well and some people jump or fall and others don\u2019t. We\u2019re all faced with the same temptations.\u201d</p> <p>Williams attributes her compassion to her childhood. Her mother, Lucille, experienced manic depression with paranoid schizophrenic tendencies. She was medicated with lithium in Williams\u2019s early years, leaving the three children mostly in the care of their father, the noted poet <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/miller-williams\">Miller Williams</a> (he read at Bill Clinton\u2019s 1997 inauguration). \u201cFrom the time I was very young, my father would take me aside and say: \u2018It\u2019s not your mother\u2019s fault, she\u2019s not well,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI learned at an early age not to expect her to be a mother in the way that a traditional mother was supposed to be. But, thank God, I had my father to bond with. I think that\u2019s what saved me from an early age.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8eb6ee8e2cfdae1fea52aeefa567a2d2fc767b6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8eb6ee8e2cfdae1fea52aeefa567a2d2fc767b6b/0_0_2464_3080/800.jpg\" alt=\"Lucinda Williams\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lucinda Williams onstage at last year\u2019s Cambridge folk festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Miller introduced his daughter to a world of writers; as a child, she chased <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/06/brief-survey-short-story-flanner-oconnor\">Flannery O\u2019Connor</a>\u2019s peacocks around her garden. That was what attracted her mother to him when they met at Louisiana State University. Miller\u2019s cultured background was the antithesis to her repressive, religious household (\u201cProbably somewhat abusive, too,\u201d says Williams). Lucille studied music, specifically piano, but largely dropped it when she married and had children. \u201cTo this day, I still don\u2019t know what my mother\u2019s dreams were,\u201d says Williams. \u201cIf she saw herself as a professional musician or not.\u201d</p> <p>After her parents split when she was 12, it was at Lucille\u2019s apartment in New Orleans that Williams heard <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/08/joan-baez-where-to-start-in-her-back-catalogue\">Joan Baez </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/may/06/leonard-cohen-10-of-the-best\">Leonard Cohen</a> for the first time. She started gigging age 18, moving frequently between southern cities (plus a stint in New York). There was sometimes a piano in the apartment when she visited her mother. \u201cWhen she would get into these states where she didn\u2019t feel good about herself \u2013 maybe she wasn\u2019t on her medication \u2013 she would get rid of her piano,\u201d says Williams. \u201cShe would say something like: \u2018I just couldn\u2019t be around it any more\u2019, almost as if the piano came to represent something that either caused great joy or complete anxiety. But then she would inevitably get another piano and then she would get happy again.\u201d Williams saw the cycle play out several times. \u201cBut she never really talked about it more than that. Did it remind her of what she didn\u2019t accomplish? What was it?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You have to go into this deep, dark well, bring it back up and write about it.

After her mother\u2019s death in 2004, Williams wasn\u2019t left with much: just her psychology paperbacks (\u201cShe could talk to you about that all day\u201d) and notebooks. \u201cI ran across something she had written in one of her darker moments,\u201d she recalls. \u201cShe would shift into this place where she would be angry and almost kinda paranoid. And I saw something she\u2019d written down. It said: \u2018I\u2019m tired of living in Miller and Cindy\u2019s shadow.\u2019 See, I was called Cindy when I was growing up. Imagine seeing that written by your mother.\u201d</p> <p>How did it make her feel? \u201cSad,\u201d she says plainly, \u201cjust sad.\u201d Her voice cracks, then she says, warmly: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m gonna cry!\u201d I apologise, but she says: \u201cNo, it\u2019s good!\u201d Williams takes antidepressants for depression and anxiety, although she has never felt alienated from her music. The opposite: she recalls a boy asking her, after a gig in the 90s, how she wrote songs. \u201cI said: you have to go down into this deep, dark well and bring it back up and write about it.\u201d He looked at her, dismayed. \u201cHe goes: \u2018I can\u2019t do that!\u2019 It was one of the saddest things I\u2019ve ever heard. He was aware enough to know that he wasn\u2019t able to deal with the demons.

  "<p>Websites using .org domain names fear they could lose their web addresses as intense backlash over the domain registry\u2019s proposed sale continues.</p> <p>The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers<em><strong> </strong></em>(Icann), the not-for-profit organization that coordinates the internet\u2019s domain name system, is deciding whether control of .org will be sold to a private equity firm about which little is known.</p> <p>The change of hands has raised concerns about censorship and how internet infrastructure affects free speech.</p> <p>Websites using .org can be registered by anybody, but over the past decade the suffix has become the go-to domain term for not-for-profits and charities. The transfer of control of .org domains has left many concerned that a new owner could raise the price of addresses on the .org registry, making it prohibitively expensive for not-for-profits that have come to rely on its name recognition.</p> <p>The not-for-profit Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), along with the Domain Name Rights Coalition, Access Now, and others, <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/document/eff-et-al-letter-icann-about-org\">wrote to Icann</a> last week urging it to stop the sale.</p> <p>\u201cEssentially it means selling censorship,\u201d Mitch Stoltz, a senior staff attorney at EFF focusing on free speech and trademark issues, said of the sale. \u201cIt could mean suspending domain names, causing websites to go dark when some other powerful interest wants them gone.\u201d</p> <p>These concerns were exacerbated when in 2019, Icann removed the cap on <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/07/icann-eliminates-org-domain-price-caps-despite-lopsided-opposition/\">the price</a> for a .org domain, having previously prohibited registrars from being charged more than $8.25.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/23/zoom-update-security-encryption-bombing\">Zoom releases security updates in response to 'Zoom-bombings'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Until now, .org has been managed by the not-for-profit Public Interest Registry (PIR) \u2013 created by the Internet Society exclusively for the purpose. Icann awarded control of .org to the Internet Society, another not-for-profit, in 2002.</p> <p>Icann is deciding if it will approve the sale of the domain registry to Ethos Capital, a private firm that emerged recently. Ethos has stated that it will keep prices low, but critics say because it is a for-profit company, it has no economic incentive to do so.</p> <h2>Attorneys general weigh in</h2> <p>Icann abruptly delayed its decision on Monday after receiving a scathing letter from the California attorney general, Xavier Becerra, on 15 April about the potential sale of .org.</p> <p>Becerra\u2019s letter came after not-for-profits and other internet freedom advocates said privatizing the domain registry would saddle it with more than $300m in debt.</p> <p>Because Icann is incorporated in California, Becerra is in charge of ensuring it is \u201cliving up to its commitments\u201d. It will provide an update on 4 May.</p> <p>\u201cThere is mounting concern that ICANN is no longer responsive to the needs of its stakeholders,\u201d Becerra wrote.</p> <p>The attorney general of Pennsylvania is also <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/04/eff-other-nonprofits-and-californias-ag-tell-icann-stop-private-equity-takeover\">reportedly investigating</a> the deal. Because PIR, the organization selling .org, is incorporated there, the state would have the power to stop it from happening.</p> <h2>The Internet Society defends itself</h2> <p>Andrew Sullivan, the CEO of the Internet Society, said those using the .org domain registry would be better served by Ethos, which would have more resources than a not-for-profit to fund them.</p> <p>He noted that the firm had been making changes responsive to criticism about the potential sale. Commitments include a cap on price increases for eight years from the start of the current contract and a \u201cstewardship council\u201d that will have a say over policies affecting .org sites.</p> <p>\u201cThis shows Ethos is trying very hard to be a good steward of this resource,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A spokesman from Ethos also said the company is taking seriously critiques of the .org sale, citing the commitments it has made to address concerns. The company made a legally-binding commitment to limit the price increases to no more than 10% per year.

Despite all the logistical headaches, the end result was, interestingly enough, one of the least surprising drafts that I can remember. Beyond the Packers\u2019 surprise pick of quarterback Jordan Love, there weren\u2019t many controversial selections and only two trades, both of them relatively minor.</p> <p>Under different circumstances, maybe there would be a reason to complain, but with everything else going on right now it\u2019s not like are particularly starved for drama. In any case, that will do it for our live coverage of the NFL draft for tonight. Thanks to everybody who followed along with us today, particularly those who contributed.

Thanks to the worldwide pandemic we\u2019re all dealing with, this year\u2019s NFL Draft is being held remotely. What has traditionally been a slick, made-for-television spectacle will now be something of a chaotic jumble. The players themselves will be responsible for providing their own camerawork which, as we learned from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/apr/12/nba-horse-tournament-espn-basketball-chris-paul-trae-young-live\" style=\"background-color: rgb(246, 246, 246);\">ESPN\u2019s Horse Tournament</a>, could give this whole affair a DIY feel.<br></p> <p>Considering the restrictions imposed upon them by the COVID-19 outbreak, the NFL should consider itself relieved that they have found a way to hold the draft at all.

In the meantime here\u2019s a look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/23/nfl-2020-mock-draft-joe-burrow-chase-young-football\">Graham Searles\u2019 projected picks</a> for tonight\u2019s first round.</p> <blockquote> <h2><strong>1) Cincinnati Bengals</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/joe-burrow?id=32194255-5267-9731-81c8-48673dcec5e2\">Joe Burrow, quarterback, LSU</a>.</strong> The Bengals have to take Burrow. He has the potential to lead them for the next 15 years and to finally get Cincinnati that playoff win Andy Dalton failed to provide. Burrow excelled in his final year at LSU leading the Tigers to an undefeated college championship. Burrow completed 76.3% of his passes for 5,671 yards, 60 touchdowns and six interceptions. Free agency showed a new era may be dawning in Cincinnati and Burrow is the man to make it concrete.</p> <h2><strong>2) Washington</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/chase-young?id=3219594f-5514-6550-d662-263c81d981b1\">Chase Young, edge rusher, Ohio State</a>.</strong> Washington have a no-brainer of their own in Young. Ron Rivera can build a strong defensive identity with a player following in the footsteps of premium Ohio State edge defenders, Joey and Nick Bosa. A 6ft 5in wrecking-ball whose tremendous speed off the line allowed him to rack up 16.5 sacks, 21.5 tackles for a loss and seven forced fumbles across 12 games in 2019. Tua Tagovailoa could be an upgrade on Dwayne Haskins but the inability to assess the quarterback\u2019s fitness up close makes Young the sensible pick.</p> <h2><strong>3) Detroit Lions</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jeffrey-okudah?id=32194f4b-5519-2813-7f59-b79efab52dd1\">Jeffrey Okudah, cornerback, Ohio State</a>.</strong> The Lions need a replacement for Darius Slay after trading him to Philadelphia. Okudah can slip straight into Slay\u2019s role as Detroit\u2019s leader in the backfield and make an impact as the best shutdown corner entering the league.</p> <h2><strong>4) New York Giants</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jedrick-wills?id=32195749-4c62-6320-8b63-20c37d057bf8\">Jedrick Wills, offensive tackle, Alabama</a>.</strong> Offensive line is a must-upgrade for the Giants. Wills, Mekhi Becton and Tristan Wirfs all would do exactly that for head coach, Joe Judge, but Wills makes sense as Judge was once Nick Saban\u2019s assistant in Alabama. Familiarity tips the scales in Wills\u2019s favour without the ability to meet with prospects this year owing to lockdown.</p> <h2><strong>5) Miami Dolphins</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/justin-herbert?id=32194845-5203-1169-a699-ce41d700202a\">Justin Herbert, quarterback, Oregon</a>.</strong> The Dolphins can pick from the best of the rest with Burrow off the board. Herbert gets the nod over Tagovailoa due to the latter\u2019s fitness problems. His 6ft 6in frame and huge arm pass the eye test. Three rushing touchdowns against Wisconsin in Oregon\u2019s Rose Bowl victory showed he can shift when needed too.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/23/nfl-2020-mock-draft-joe-burrow-chase-young-football\">NFL 2020 mock draft: Joe Burrow is No1 but who are the sleeper picks?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div>",

  "<p>Journalists at the Russian business newspaper Vedomosti have rebelled against their new management after the paper\u2019s editor was accused of banning criticism of constitutional amendments backed by Vladimir Putin and the use of data from an independent pollster.</p> <p>In a blistering opinion article <a href=\"https://www.vedomosti.ru/opinion/articles/2020/04/23/827133-novie-vedomosti\">published</a> on the newspaper\u2019s website on Thursday, the editorial staff said the new editor had undermined trust by massaging headlines about the Russian state energy company Rosneft and blocking a recent column critical of the same company and its boss, Igor Sechin.</p> <p>The editorial, titled \u201cThe New Vedomosti\u201d, was published without the editor\u2019s consent, a staff member confirmed, adding that it wasn\u2019t expected to stay online for long.</p> <p>\u201cHaving been deprived of its reputation, Vedomosti will become just another dependent and controlled media outlet whose task won\u2019t be fulfilling the needs of its readers with verified news and high-quality analysis, but fulfilling the interests and ambitions of its official and unnamed owners,\u201d the newspaper\u2019s staff wrote. They said they intended to \u201cdefend the values\u201d on which the newspaper was founded.</p> <p>The journalists called for the new editor, Andrey Shmarov, to be replaced. Shmarov has been approached for comment.</p> <p>In remarks to the state news agency RIA Novosti, Shmarov confirmed that he was changing the newspaper\u2019s editorial policies but had not introduced censorship. \u201cIf I had violated this ban [on censorship], they could take me to court,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd nobody has filed suit against me.\u201d</p> <p>Shmarov\u2019s remarks did not address concrete claims about the website content that he had edited. He added that the appearance of the opinion article \u201cbears witness to the freedom of expression in this publication\u201d.</p> <p>It is possible that some staff will resign in protest. \u201cMany [of us] are talking about quitting,\u201d one journalist at the paper told the Guardian.</p> <p>Vedomosti, founded in 1999 in a partnership that included the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal, is one of Russia\u2019s most storied business newspapers. The newspaper has changed hands several times since Russia imposed new laws in 2014 that limited foreign control of media. In March it was announced that Vedomosti had been sold again, to the owner of an investment firm and editor-in-chief of Argumenty i Fakty, a weekly newspaper owned by the Moscow government.</p> <p>The new owners installed Shmarov, who newspaper staff allege personally intervened to change the headline of an article about Sechin and remove a column by Konstantin Sonin, an economist, that criticised Sechin.</p> <p>In the opinion article, the newspaper staff said the alleged actions \u201ccontradicted the publicly stated values and principles of the publication\u201d.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Ksenia Boletskaya, the newspaper\u2019s media editor, wrote that Shmarov had banned the publication of polls by the independent pollster Levada because the Kremlin had opposed them, and that Shmarov had blocked reporters from criticising Putin\u2019s plans to use <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/vladimir-putin-amendment-power-russia-2024\">constitutional amendments to \u201czero out\u201d his presidential terms</a>, potentially allowing him to hold power until 2036. \u201cFor failing to follow the bans, you\u2019ll be fired,\u201d Boletskaya wrote.</p> <p>A number of independent outlets claim they have been censored by owners with pro-government views. In 2014, staff at the news website Lenta.ru complained of censorship and quit en masse after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/12/editor-russian-news-site-replaced-lenta\">the site\u2019s editor was dismissed</a>. </p> <p>In 2016, a newly installed manager of RBC, another business news site, which had written about controversial topics including Putin\u2019s children, told reporters there were \u201csolid double lines\u201d that the reporters had to be careful not to cross. Asked what those were, the manager replied: \u201cUnfortunately, nobody knows where the solid double line is.\u201d</p> <p>The Vedomosti journalist said reporters were shocked by the sudden sale and then tightening of control over stories. \u201cYou can\u2019t exaggerate the amount of damage done [to Vedomosti] in the last month,\u201d they said. \u201cThey\u2019re destroying it from the inside.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>This is not unprecedented.</p> <p>Not the presence of a new disease. Not the enforced social measures that fragment how we interact, and who with. Not the laying to waste of the environment. Not the strategies of triage, and stratified disposability of human lives.</p> <p>I think of this every time I get a communication from someone that starts with a sentence about our \u201cunprecedented\u201d or \u201cexceptional\u201d situation. I\u2019m not the only one to see it. Indigenous scholars globally \u2013 across epidemiology, economics, public health, critical race studies, and law \u2013 have noted it.

Well, in part because every piece published right now has to acknowledge the crisis happening around us as a foundational anxiety of its audience.</p> <p>But also because, in our enduring foundation of trauma as First Nations people, I feel compelled to remind readers that we have faced moments like this before \u2013 and have ensured our survival by meeting these moments with resilience, resistance and resurgence. Since colonisation, it is from those moments that First Nations poetry has sprung.</p> <p>Fire Front \u2013 a new anthology of First Nations poetry and essays \u2013 was published in March, rushed forward from May due to concerns about supply and distribution lines in our latest pandemic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"42c319299ad1d553acb4be23f6d2ba3381de031d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42c319299ad1d553acb4be23f6d2ba3381de031d/0_0_1522_2339/651.jpg\" alt=\"Fire Front cover\" width=\"651\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fire Front is a new anthology of First Nations poetry edited by Alison Whittaker</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UQP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Plenty of Indigenous poetry, including that featured in Fire Front, has been written in response to something \u2013 whether it\u2019s individual or collective trauma, major events in colonial history, political movements, moments of respite and joy, even other poems.<strong> </strong>Fire Front seeks to stand in as a kind of memory to them, with 53 works throughout the history of Indigenous published poetry, and five essays from key Blak thinkers reflecting on what those poems have meant to them, and to us.</p> <p>And what do these poems mean to us, right now \u2013 aside from offering a testament to our survival? They give us the dignity of bearing witness to each other, during a long era through which our testimonies have been discredited, and through which we have been isolated from one another.</p> <p>What does it mean to hold something like this in your hand, and be there together in a shared \u2013 if not always uniform \u2013 vision of ourselves as a people? Also, what does it mean to just read good poetry, and to read the essays of others who have been fully immersed in their heat? As these poems go out to First Nations readers, who may have read all or some of them individually, I hope we\u2019ll begin to see some of that collective power of care and comfort.</p> <p>The poems in Fire Front have been chosen because they represent the vital power of a renaissance in Blak verse. These poems know that poetry itself is not enough. These are not poems that observe our world for comfort; instead, they independently (and now together, in this book) clear a path for our imagination. They tell us to do something.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/26/alexis-wright-hey-ancestor\">Hey, Ancestor! by Alexis Wright</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lionel Fogarty calls us to be cautious of comfortable complicity, \u201ceven oiling the dramatist idea after death to the up coming\u201d.
