This \u201cexceptional\u201d crisis measure gave the government temporary constitutional powers to introduce restrictions during the pandemic. Now the government is planning legislation allowing it to lift the state of emergency while keeping certain measures to avoid a second wave of Covid-19.</p> \n  <p>The number of patients in intensive care units in hospitals with the virus has dropped to below 1,000, from a spike of more than 7,000 in April, and the number of deaths each day is falling.

These measures would last until November, but could be changed according to circumstances. The law would not give the French authorities the power to reimpose a lockdown; if the virus suddenly returns, the government will have to seek a decree authorising new restrictions over the whole or part of France, Matignon, the French equivalent of Number 10, said.</p> \n  <p>France\u2019s external borders are currently closed to all but essential workers and those with a \u201ccompelling\u201d reason to enter the country.

One in four tests conducted in the country come back positive, the WHO said, which indicates a high level of infection. </p> \n  <p>Here are the key developments from the last few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Brazil restored on Tuesday detailed Covid-19 data to the official national website,</strong> following a scandal about the removal of cumulative totals and a ruling by a Supreme Court justice that the full set of information be reinstated.<br>The detailed information, with cumulative totals and breakdowns by state, was restored to the website https://covid.saude.gov.br/, Reuters confirmed on Tuesday afternoon.</li> \n   <li><strong>The World Health Organization\u2019s Covid-19 technical lead backtracked on her comment that asymptomatic transmission of the virus was \u201cvery rare\u201d</strong>. \u201cI think that it\u2019s a misunderstanding to state the asymptomatic transmission globally is very rare,\u201d Dr Maria Van Kerkhove said, noting modelling suggesting 40% of infections could be transmitted by people without symptoms.</li> \n   <li><strong>A group of EU member states called for medical and equipment stockpiles to be increased.</strong> The leaders of Denmark, Spain and Germany, as well as France, Belgium and Poland, called for measures to boost the bloc\u2019s long-term resilience to public health crises and backed proposals for shared research and development of vaccines and treatment.</li> \n   <li><strong>The epidemic in Mexico is advancing toward its peak level of infections, the World Health Organization warned.</strong> Mexico, where total confirmed cases exceed 120,000 and the death toll stands at about 14,000, began a gradual re-opening of the economy at the start of June.</li> \n   <li><strong>Pakistan should implement intermittent lockdowns to counter a surge in infections, the World Health Organization advised</strong>. The increase has come as the country was loosening restrictions.</li> \n   <li><strong>Zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas will be allowed to reopen in England from 15 June. </strong>Boris Johnson will make the official announcement on Wednesday.</li> \n   <li><strong>There have been </strong><strong>sharp rises in reports of violence against women across Latin America</strong>, already a hotspot for gender-based violence, since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, the International Rescue Committee has said. Meghan Lopez, the IRC\u2019s regional director for Latin America, said some women and girls were stuck with perpetrators 24 hours a day.</li> \n   <li><strong>The world faces a food crisis worse than any seen for at least 50 years, the UN has warned</strong>. Social protections for poor people are urgently needed as the looming recession following the Covid-19 pandemic may put basic nutrition out of reach.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>A supreme court judge in Brazil has ordered Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s administration to resume publishing complete Covid-19 statistics</strong>. His government sparked outrage on Saturday by purging the health ministry website of data on to pandemic and announcing it would stop publishing the death toll or number of infections.</li> \n   <li><strong>Nearly one in five people in Iran may have been infected with coronavirus since the country\u2019s outbreak</strong>, a health official said. This meant the virus was \u201cmuch less lethal than we or the world had anticipated\u201d, said Ehsan Mostafavi, a member of the taskforce set up to combat Covid-19.</li> \n   <li><strong>Face masks will remain compulsory in all public spaces even after Spain\u2019s Covid-19 state of emergency ends on 22 June.</strong> \u201cThe message is one of prudence and caution,\u201d said the government spokeswoman, Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Montero. \u201cUntil there is a vaccine or a treatment, the virus remains a threat. We can\u2019t think that the danger has gone.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>Fifty-two Cuban medics who flew to Italy to help doctors treat Europe\u2019s first mass coronavirus outbreak returned home to a heroes\u2019 welcome</strong>. The medical brigade, comprising 36 doctors, 15 nurses and a logistics specialist, arrived in Milan on 22 March and were the first ever to be deployed to a European country.</li> \n   <li><strong>Up to 600 deaths in Kano, northern Nigeria, most within a single week in April, were caused by an undetected outbreak of Covid-19, officials said</strong>. Government investigations, which began after reports of hundreds of deaths caused alarm in Nigeria\u2019s second largest city, linked 50-60% of 979 \u201cmysterious\u201d deaths to the virus.</li> \n   <li><strong>Coronavirus may have been present and spreading in Wuhan as early as August last year</strong>, according to a study that analysed satellite imagery of car parks outside major hospitals and search engine data.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div>",

  "<p><strong>What&nbsp;was the situation like when the league was suspended on 13 March? </strong>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/07/crystal-palace-watford-premier-league-match-report\">1-0 victory against Watford</a> courtesy of Jordan Ayew\u2019s winner at Selhurst Park just before the enforced break was Palace\u2019s third in succession over clubs in the lower half of the table and has virtually assured survival for Roy Hodgson\u2019s side already.

They still have to travel to Liverpool, Leicester and Wolves, not to mention home fixtures against Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham on the final day which may put paid to their chances of surpassing 2014-15\u2019s 10th place \u2013 the club\u2019s highest Premier League finish. At least Hodgson will have a full squad to choose from as he attempts to navigate the choppy waters. Even Mamadou Sakho has been back in training having missed the majority of the season because of injury. The France defender is one of Palace\u2019s highest earners and has only a year left on his contract at Selhurst Park with the Lyon president, Jean-Michel Aulas, saying he \u201chas the right personality\u201d after being linked with a move to the Ligue 1 club a few weeks ago.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Recap\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <strong>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</strong>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><br><strong>What needs to be done to have a successful end to the season? </strong>Palace supporters have been starved of excitement in their home matches all season having seen their team score only 12 goals in 15 matches but with such a tricky run-in it is hard to see that tally increasing much. The superb form of Ayew has made up for Wilfried Zaha\u2019s least effective season for some time, although the Ivory Coast forward remains Palace\u2019s most potent attacking threat. Finding an effective combination with Christian Benteke remains the biggest challenge for their 72-year-old manager, who signed a new one-year contract the day before the win against Watford on 7 March. <br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Have players and staff behaved during lockdown? </strong>There were no indiscretions by any of Palace\u2019s squad with several players praising the club\u2019s efforts to keep them informed before they returned to training. Staff also made efforts to check on more than 1,000 supporters over the age of 70 to see if they could provide any assistance, including going shopping for some season ticket holders.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5a1ffa3f-6978-4219-b120-57b87ad96a02\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Any unsung/community heroes? </strong>Zaha and his business partner Obi Williams have provided free accommodation for 50 NHS workers during the pandemic through their company Zo Properties, while the entire squad contributed a significant donation to Age UK Croydon and Selhurst Park was used as a refreshment base for ambulance workers. Chefs made more 6,000 meals for NHS staff and vulnerable people, while the Palace for Life foundation took its mentoring initiatives for disadvantaged young people in south London online in an attempt to ease the mental health challenges of lockdown. Patrick van Aanholt, meanwhile, took on Twitter troll Katie Hopkins after she dismissed the Black Lives Matter movement and told the Dutchman to \u201ckneel and kiss her ring\u201d. \u201cAs for your ring you are welcome to come to Selhurst and kiss my big toe ... I\u2019ll wait,\u201d he responded.<br><br><strong>Key player in the run-in?</strong> Two years since he joined from Getafe on a free transfer, Vicente Guaita has firmly established himself as Palace\u2019s No 1 thanks to some brilliant performances this season. That the Spaniard\u2019s only big mistake in 28 matches so far came in the defeat to Sheffield United in February is testament to his ability, with boyhood club Valencia reported to be interested in bringing him home this summer. The 33-year-old looks equipped to play at the highest level and will certainly have plenty of opportunities to shine against some of the Premier League\u2019s best attacks over the next few weeks.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec0fcc37a9123bb4a1abba3102fda3d856f2c8b7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec0fcc37a9123bb4a1abba3102fda3d856f2c8b7/0_127_3273_1964/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crystal Palace\u2019s Spanish goalkeeper Vicente Guaita has been in fine form this season.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crystal Palace\u2019s Spanish goalkeeper Vicente Guaita has been in fine form this season.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>End-of-season-prediction </strong>12th.

  "<p>The coronavirus pandemic will hit Coronation Street on 24 July when newly filmed episodes featuring the impact of the health emergency and recorded under strict restrictions are broadcast, although the producers promise the long-running soap will not be turned into a medical drama.</p> <p>Producers say the most noticeable difference for viewers will be in how the show has been filmed. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/18/coronavirus-guidelines-agreed-to-get-the-television-cameras-rolling-again\">Shooting resumed on Monday under </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/18/coronavirus-guidelines-agreed-to-get-the-television-cameras-rolling-again\">physical distancing measures</a>, including no kissing and actors over the age of 70 barred, appearing in storylines via Zoom calls. The move has ensured that fans of the 59-year-old soap do not run out of fresh episodes to watch.</p> <p>ITV has been rationing broadcasts, cutting the weekly airings from six to three, to stretch a stockpile of episodes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/16/filming-of-bbc-peaky-blinders-and-line-of-duty-postponed-coronavirus\">accumulated before TV and film production halted nationwide in March.</a> Typically, broadcasters sit on a stock of several months of shows such as Coronation Street and EastEnders but the pandemic has severely depleted that buffer.</p> <p>Coronation Street\u2019s makers said that there will be a noticeable issue with continuity, moving from episodes made before the pandemic to new ones under physical distancing rules, that will be so obvious it will be like \u201csomeone has flicked a switch\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe episode on 24 July is the first one [filmed] after the pandemic hit,\u201d said Iain MacLeod, series producer on Coronation Street. \u201cIt will be like a day-night transition in our fictional universe.\u201d</p> <p>However, he added that with blanket media coverage of the health emergency producers were aware that fans probably did not want to see their favourite soap taken over by virus storylines.</p> <p>\u201cWe do it with quite a light touch actually,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t feel we wanted to do is that suddenly it was everywhere. I don\u2019t think people tune into Corrie wanting to see more people banging on about the pandemic. We didn\u2019t want to turn it into a medical drama or a soap version of Dustin Hoffman\u2019s Outbreak. The main difference will be the visual element of our world. The most notable symptom people will see will be social distancing measures.\u201d</p> <p>As in real life characters will be seen physically distancing and washing their hands, while cafes and restaurants will be operating as takeaways. MacLeod admitted that they have had to use some camera angle \u201ccheats\u201d in cases where characters who are couples cannot hold hands, kiss or sit together on a sofa, because the actors that play them have to social distance.</p> <p>The characters of actors over the age of 70, who are not allowed back on set yet, will be referred to as self-isolating upstairs or in other rooms. But they will also continue to appear in storylines using Zoom, FaceTime and Skype calls, just as is happening in the real world.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want Ken Barlow getting sick on my watch,\u201d ITV\u2019s director of television Kevin Lygo said recently, referring to the 88-year old character played by William Roache, who has been on the show since 1960.</p> <p>Props have been cut back to a minimum, so there is less handling and cleaning, and off-set location filming is out, as are \u201cHollywood spectacular\u201d elements of storyline planned to mark Coronation Street\u2019s 60th anniversary in December. In keeping with government guidelines, the Rovers Return pub will be open for takeaway coffee, tea and food but alcohol will not be consumed on the premises.</p> <p>\u201cI think the viewers will like it,\u201d said MacLeod. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like compromised Corrie, it feels like classic Corrie.\u201d&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f08f832c1b5660061cc487c3888648cbb0e329d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f08f832c1b5660061cc487c3888648cbb0e329d/0_216_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coronation Street Back filming after lockdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coronation Street Back filming after lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Life on set has also changed dramatically with kitchen facilities for cast and crew turned into additional hand washing facilities. The temperature of cast and crew is also being taken when they arrive for filming at the Coronation Street set in Trafford, Greater Manchester.&nbsp;Security guards carry poles to safely enforce physical distances for those who forget, and filming units operate in colour-coded groups.</p> <p>\u201cWe were going to use blue and red but there were too many tribal football loyalties relating to those colours,\u201d said John Whiston, ITV\u2019s managing director of continuing drama. \u201cSo on Corrie it is green, orange and pink to avoid that. All our social spaces are now anti-social spaces. Seats are taped off, people hang out in their cars or wherever they can find a quiet space. It feels very unnatural. But it is the way we are going to have to do it for now.\u201d</p> <p>A big question for fans is when they will come off their restricted diet of three episodes a week.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it will be before the autumn really,\u201d says Whiston. \u201cWe will start producing more to build a buffer but my biggest fear is a second lockdown or stoppage so we don\u2019t want to be too aggressive [returning to six episodes].\u201d</p> <p>The BBC plans to resume the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/14/bbc-to-resume-filming-eastenders-and-top-gear-by-end-of-june-coronavirus\">filming of East</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/14/bbc-to-resume-filming-eastenders-and-top-gear-by-end-of-june-coronavirus\">Enders and Top Gear by the end of the month</a>.</p>",

  "<p>It is not, overall, a great time to be an actor. Or a director, or a musician, or a writer for the stage or indeed almost anyone involved in the creative arts. The practical effects of the pandemic \u2013 and its gross mismanagement \u2013 on planned productions (postponed indefinitely), theatre finances (which depend on packed, not socially distanced, houses) and freedom to gather, rehearse, collaborate and generate ideas are already being felt, but their ramifications have hardly begun.</p> <p>Individual actors have found ways to continue to provide entertainment and add to the cultural conversation (Samuel West, for example, began a series of beautiful and restorative poetry readings requested by followers on his Twitter account, to which more and more actors have added their voices as the weeks have passed), but the brightest chink of light in the darkness so far, and reaching the widest audience, has been offered by the small screen.</p> <p>Documentaries have been produced by giving people cameras or having them film themselves on smartphones. Charity events have been hosted by presenters isolated in audience-free studios with contributions filmed from scattered talent. Dramas have emerged from scripts that work around and with the restrictions caused by lockdown. They are directed remotely, lit in their own homes by actors themselves (following the instructions of the people far away who actually know what they are doing) and edited in home studios, on laptops, doubtless with a fair bit of wailing and gnashing of teeth at every stage. But they have made it on to our screens and into our ever more desperate and welcoming homes</p> <p>Obviously they have their limitations, but there is at the same time an appeal and an intimacy that is all their own. It\u2019s impossible not to watch and know that you are witnessing the results of goodwill, Heath Robinsonesque ingenuity and artistic endeavours. There\u2019s an odd purity to it. Creators gonna create. Actors gonna act. And they\u2019re always gonna find their way to an audience.</p> <p>All of this is present in particular abundance with the latest lockdown offering \u2013&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08dnl67\">Staged</a> (BBC One), a comedy based on an original idea by Simon Evans (who also writes and directs) and Phin Glynn, and starring Michael Sheen and David Tennant. Or, David Tennant and Michael Sheen. Arguments over billing form a running gag (\u201cYou were first in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/31/good-omens-review-sheen-and-tennant-fight-the-devil-with-dill-sauce\">Good Omens</a>!\u201d), eventually leading to second and birth-not-Equity names being pressed into service to muddy the alphabetical waters. The episodes\u2019 credits change accordingly \u2013 just one of the many things to gladden the heart during the six quarter-hour episodes that comprise the series.</p> <p>It\u2019s all a bit meta, but that\u2019s the joy of it. It depends on you knowing that Tennant and Sheen are friends in real life, so that you can fully enjoy the (one presumes) unscripted banter between them, particularly before and after the credits but also dotted through the \u201creal\u201d story of director Simon attempting to persuade them to rehearse a play for the West End despite being furloughed.</p> <p>Towards the end of the first episode they riff (and if this too is scripted by Evans, my deepest apologies and unending admiration for so perfectly evoking the artlessness of old, witty friends\u2019 conversation) on Sheen going out to scream in the garden. \u201cThat\u2019s how we summon the haggis,\u201d says Tennant thoughtfully. \u201cIs that still happening in contemporary Scotland?\u201d asks Sheen politely. \u201cThe haggis don\u2019t come if you don\u2019t do it right,\u201d Tennant informs him. \u201cWe train for years.\u201d \u201cWell, if the haggis don\u2019t come, nobody\u2019s happy,\u201d says Sheen. \u201cThat\u2019s the Scottish Tourism Board slogan right there.\u201d Think Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon in The Trip, just without the vicious, gnawing ego and marauding emotional needs barely kept in check.</p> <p>The story itself is slight. Sheen doesn\u2019t really want to do the play \u2013 Pirandello\u2019s Six Characters in Search of an Author, chosen I presume for its resonant absurdism and metafictional premise \u2013 while another actor champs at the bit offscreen to take part (occasioning a lovely turn from Nina Sosanya as an agent whom pandemic conditions have done nothing to unweary).</p> <p>It\u2019s a light, charming offering. Only two episodes were available for review, but all six are to be released en masse through iPlayer. I shall try and ration them \u2013 15 minutes every now and again when I feel the bleakness start to encroach too much. And on we\u2019ll go. Art, eh? Useful stuff.</p>",

Therefore, as a precaution, we are in the process of contacting the 69 patients who were diagnosed with Covid-19 having tested positive on the fast track machine from 7 May when the machine came into use and the 27 May.</p> \n   <p>We understand that this issue may concern patients and families.

(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/10/uk-coronavirus-live-news-latest-updates-furlough-pmqs-covid-19-latest?page=with:block-5ee0f4a88f0860ca20fa9ab7#block-5ee0f4a88f0860ca20fa9ab7\">4.23pm.)</a> Ferguson used to be a member of Sage and his epidemiological modelling has been highly influential with government. Asked about his claim at the the press conference, Johnson said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Of course we are going to have to look back on all of this and learn lessons that we can. But, frankly, I think a lot of these questions are still premature. There are lots of things, lots of data, things that we still don\u2019t know.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Sir Patrick Vallance</strong>, the goverment\u2019s chief scientific adviser, and <strong>Prof Chris Whitty</strong>, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, also argued that now was not the time to make that assessment. But none of the three men said anything to suggest that the Ferguson assessment might be wrong. On Sunday, when another epidemiologist, <strong>Prof John Edmunds</strong>, made a very similar claim on the Andrew Marr show, <strong>Matt Hancock</strong>, the health secretary, was asked out right if he agreed <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/07062001.pdf\">and he said no. </a>Johnson may have decided that the claim is too plausible to dismiss outright. <strong>Whitty</strong> stressed that, at the time when decisions about the lockdown were being taken, they had \u201cvery limited information about this virus\u201d.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/support-bubble-plan-lets-single-parents-in-england-combine-households\">Johnson announced that around 11 million people living alone or as single parents will be allowed to combine with another household to form a \u201csupport bubble\u201d in England.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said the coronavirus pandemic had \u201ca long way to go\u201d.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There are lots of things, lots of data, things that we still don\u2019t know, and this epidemic has a long way to go, alas. Not just in this country, but around the world.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Whitty</strong> made a similar point. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>To be very clear, we are not at the end of this epidemic, not be a long shot.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is an awkward admission for the PM because tomorrow marks 12 weeks from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/boris-johnson-uk-can-turn-tide-of-coronavirus-in-12-weeks\">the day when he said the UK could turn the tide in the fight against coronavirus in 12 weeks.</a> He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think, looking at it all, that we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks and I\u2019m absolutely confident that we can send coronavirus packing in this country.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Vallance said it was wrong to see the instruction to remain two metres away from people as a firm scientific rule.</strong> He explained:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is not a rule, it is not a scientific rule - it is a risk-based assessment on when risk reduces. And the risks are associated with distance - so the risk falls after two metres - time, what mitigating factors you can put in place, which can include whether you are sitting side-by-side, back-to-back or face-to-face, whether you\u2019ve got face covering, whether there is ventilation and other measures ...</p> \n   <p>It is wrong to portray this as a scientific rule that says it is two metres or nothing - that is not what the advice has been and it is not what the advice is now.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Coming from Vallance, this sounded like the clearest indication that, in England at least, the two-metre rule will go.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Whitty said there was \u201ca reasonable chance\u201d of a second spike of infections happening in the winter. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We all think there is a reasonable chance that in the winter this virus will have some advantages it doesn\u2019t have at the rest of the year. It is something that transmits more easily indoors, for example, and therefore things that are working well in summer and autumn may cease to be working as well in winter.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Whitty said he would have liked the government to have been able to do more testing early on.</strong> Asked to name his biggest regret, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think there is a long list, actually, of things that we need to look at very seriously.</p> \n   <p>If I was to choose one, it would probably be looking at how we could ... speed up testing very early on in the epidemic.

But he went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The epidemic was doubling every three to four days before lockdown interventions were introduced. So had we introduced lockdown measures a week earlier, we would have reduced the final death toll by at least a half.</p> \n   <p>Whilst I think the measures, given what we knew about this virus then, in terms of its transmission and its lethality, were warranted, I\u2019m second guessing at this point, certainly had we introduced them earlier we would have seen many fewer deaths. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"69889190-90d6-40f1-a768-cffabc2d8ce4\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SKNpCBBuVws?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Ferguson said he also agreed with <strong>Prof John Edmunds</strong>, another epidemic modelling specialist, based at the London School of Hygiene and Tropic Medicine. Edmunds sits on the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (as Ferguson did, until he had to resign in May), and on Sunday Ferguson <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/07062003.pdf\">told the Marr Show: </a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We should have gone into lockdown earlier. I think it would have been hard to do it, and I think the data that we were dealing with in the early part of March, and our current situational awareness was really quite poor. And so I think it would have been very hard to pull the trigger at that point, but I wish we had. I wish we had gone into lockdown earlier. I think that has cost a lot of lives unfortunately.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>After Edmunds made this claim on Sunday ministers hit back hard, and it is not hard to see why. The UK government introduced a full lockdown after most other European countries (see the chart below, from <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/mrc-gida/2020-03-30-COVID19-Report-13.pdf\">this paper)</a> and it has been claimed that this was, at least in part, because Johnson had a strong, libertarian aversion to measures of this kind.

And then there are other days when it struggles hard to get much beyond the \u2018so what\u2019 territory. Today was closer to the latter category. Despite all talk of unease on the Tory benches (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/10/uk-coronavirus-live-news-latest-updates-furlough-pmqs-covid-19-latest?page=with:block-5ee0a35d8f0860ca20fa95f7#block-5ee0a35d8f0860ca20fa95f7\">10.17am)</a>, not a peep emerged. The Black Lives Matters protests did come up, but only in a relatively perfunctory manner. And the Boris Johnson/Keir Starmer exchanges - normally the highlight - were inconclusive. Neither was particularly good.</p> \n  <p>Starmer seems to view PMQs as a war of attrition; he shows no interest in flash, \u2018knockout blow\u2019 moments, preferring a steady stream that portray the opposition as measured and sensible, and Johnson as negligent. Mostly this has worked well, but it did not particularly today. He devoted his first two questions to asking why measures in reports weren\u2019t being implemented. But they are, claimed Johnson. This may be wishful thinking, but it was not contested by Starmer, and a viewer without prior knowledge may have been left wondering if Johnson had a point.</p> \n  <p>Starmer\u2019s best question was his third, about the death numbers. He was calm and factual, and his question - \u201cthere\u2019s no pride in these numbers, is there?\u201d - was unanswerable. Johnson\u2019s response was particularly poor. If No 10 really thinks it will be able to hold off addressing this issue for the rest of the year just by claiming it\u2019s too early to make international comparisons, it is likely to be disappointed.</p> \n  <p>Johnson\u2019s best moments came when Starmer asked about schools, and Johnson was able to accuse Labour of inconsistency - arguing for continued closures earlier, complaining about continued closures now. This is not wholly fair - Labour\u2019s argument is that a more consensual approach was needed to facilitate school opening - but defending a nuanced position is never straightforward, and by the standards of political sloganising rather than high-grade logic, Johnson\u2019s charge was true enough to stick. It was also interesting to see him use Starmer\u2019s profession against him. Generally commentators have taken the view the Starmer\u2019s lawyerly precision (we are not allowed call him \u201cforensic\u201d any more, the clich\u00e9 police have ruled) is a bonus, but Johnson now seems to running the line that, because Starmer is a barrister, he will just say whatever is convenient to his case.</p> \n  <p>Johnson actually had an announcement to make: a \u00a363m welfare programme for schools. But the way he raised it, it was hard to tell whether or not this was anything new. If this was supposed to give him good ammunition to use against Starmer, it did not work out.</p> \n  <p>The best question of the day was probably Kirsty Blackman\u2019s. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/10/uk-coronavirus-live-news-latest-updates-furlough-pmqs-covid-19-latest?page=with:block-5ee0c3858f08758335229663#block-5ee0c3858f08758335229663\"> 12.28pm.) </a>But even that did not generate a memorable answer.

But he is using the same phrase as the former Ofsted chief <strong>Sir Michael Wilshaw</strong>, who said the Department for Education had made a mess of things when he described pupils missing school this morning as an \u201cabsolute tragedy\u201d.

  "<p>Now it gets serious for HSBC. It\u2019s one thing to be accused, rightly, by pundits and even the odd shareholder, of \u201ckowtowing to China\u201d by supporting publicly the security crackdown law for Hong Kong<strong>. </strong>The stakes become higher when the US secretary of state, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/10/mike-pompeo-criticises-hsbc-for-corporate-kowtow-to-china-hong-kong\">Mike Pompeo, makes the same accusation</a> and, for good measure, mocks HSBC\u2019s failure to win respect in Beijing with its \u201cshow of fealty\u201d.</p> <p>Having tried to avoid making political statements for decades (apart from on the Scottish independence referendum, oddly), HSBC is now firmly on the geopolitical stage. Its board knows that, of course, and chairman Mark Tucker seems to have set the course: if push comes to shove, the bank will opt for China.</p> <p>The whole \u201cpivot to Asia\u201d strategy under former chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, leads that way. So does the hard commercial fact the HSBC never really was the \u201cworld\u2019s local bank\u201d, as the old slogan had it \u2013 55% of profits come from Hong Kong and about 90% from Asia. Tucker, say insiders, imagines HSBC\u2019s long-term future as a sort of JP Morgan of Asia.</p> <p>Thus nobody should be surprised that Peter Wong, HSBC\u2019s top executive in Asia, signed a petition supporting China\u2019s proposed new powers for Hong Kong. For HSBC to post a picture of him with pen in hand was provocative in the extreme, but one assumes Beijing liked, or expected, the flourish.</p> <p>Yet, Tucker and the chief executive, Noel Quinn, can also be under no illusions about Washington\u2019s ability to wreck a chunk of HSBC\u2019s business should it wish. The ability to clear dollars is crucial for an international bank. The ultimate sanction \u2013 withdrawal of a US banking licence \u2013 may be many steps away but it exists and represents a very large stick.</p> <p>Indeed, we\u2019ve had one mini-rehearsal already. HSBC was hit with a $1.9bn fine in the US in 2012 for allowing terrorists and Mexican and Colombian drug cartels to launder millions of dollars. The episode could have been worse if the US justice department had pursued a criminal prosecution. A conviction would have led to an automatic review of the bank\u2019s charter to operate in the US.</p> <p>There was more than a whiff of politics about the decision not to prosecute. A US congressional report published letters from George Osborne, the UK chancellor at the time, and UK regulators warning of a \u201cfinancial calamity\u201d if HSBC were put in the dock. The calamity was avoided but HSBC never had much goodwill in Washington even before Trump. The UK\u2019s ability to plead on HSBC\u2019s behalf is surely also lesser these days.</p> <p>The Huawei connection adds another layer of complexity. To Beijing\u2019s fury, HSBC handed over documents that led to arrest in Canada in 2018 of the Chinese technology company\u2019s chief financial officer. Meanwhile, the response of ordinary Hongkongers to HSBC\u2019s backing of Beijing is anyone\u2019s guess. The bank enjoys a status unlike anything in the west, with share certificates handed down through generations; a serious customer backlash could hurt.</p> <p>For now, Tucker &amp; co seem to be trying to muddle through. It\u2019ll hope US-China tensions die down and presumably will keep further inflammatory stances to a minimum. One could call the strategy logical given the commercial bind but there is absolutely no guarantee it will work. HSBC is in a deep political hole with no reliable friends.</p> <h2><strong>Ocado raises the stakes</strong></h2> <p>Another day, another fundraising for Ocado, wonder-stock of the FTSE 100 index. It was only last December that the online grocery retailer, or supplier to other grocers of robot-filled warehouses, raised \u00a3500m via issuing convertible bonds. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/jun/10/ocado-plans-to-raise-1bn-as-online-deliveries-boom-in-the-uk\">Now it\u2019s back for another bite</a>: \u00a3350m in convertibles, plus \u00a3657m of equity.</p> <p>Both offers, one suspects, will be snapped up. Founder and chief executive, Tim Steiner, tells a compelling tale about how the pandemic is accelerating growth of online shopping by years. Overseas partners are banging on the door, wanting bigger warehouses sooner, creating the need for Ocado to invest harder.</p> <p>The size of these upfront investments is colossal, and sceptics might ask why Ocado can\u2019t shove more of the upfront spend on to the partners. The market, though, seems minded to worry about cash outflows another day. Ocado expects to get its bonds away with an interest rate of 0.5%-1.0%. If you raise money that cheaply, you would.</p>",
  "<p>Wednesday is Boris Johnson\u2019s take your inner child to work day. The day when he falls out of bed, puts on a suit, uses a brush to turn his hair into a total state and rides out of his Downing Street flat to first face <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/10/keir-starmer-tells-pm-to-take-responsibility-for-his-failures-on-schools\">prime minister\u2019s questions</a> in the Commons before doing his weekly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/support-bubble-plan-lets-single-parents-in-england-combine-households\">coronavirus press briefing</a> at 5pm.</p> <p>Quite what he does in the intervening six days, almost no one has a clue as he is rarely spotted in the wild and there is no visible evidence of any action. Though many of us \u2013 including a large number of Tory MPs who are beginning to think they might have backed the wrong man as his approval and competency ratings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/30/tory-poll-lead-collapses-as-voters-say-cummings-should-go\">plummet</a> \u2013 would dearly love to know. Perhaps he has been taking time out to catch up with the third series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/21/ozark-is-brilliant-sprawling-and-intense-gemma-whelans-lockdown-tv\">Ozark</a>.</p> <p>Fair to say that until now Boris has taken a hammering from Keir Starmer at PMQs. Exposed for the petulant narcissist he so clearly is. Yet on Wednesday he escaped with his pride more or less intact. Not because he was any better at responding to the questions \u2013 Boris has yet to answer any question directly or truthfully \u2013 but more because the Labour leader seemed vaguely distracted and not at the top of his game. Perhaps it had all got too easy for Starmer and he had come to believe that all he needed to do was turn up, do his surgical QC schtick and wipe the floor with the prime minister.</p> <p>After an unsatisfactory opening skirmish on racism in the UK \u2013 surely now would have been the time for Starmer to ask if Boris regretted his own use of the terms \u201cpicaninnies\u201d \u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d and \u201cletterboxes\u201d and whether that might have normalised racist attitudes to people from BAME communities \u2013 in which Boris was allowed to suggest he had already implemented the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/sep/08/racial-bias-uk-criminal-justice-david-lammy\">Lammy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/19/windrush-report-condemns-home-office-ignorance-and-thoughtlessness\">Windrush</a> reports in full, the Labour leader did land a telling blow on the coronavirus death rate. Which bit of the excess 63,000 deaths was the PM proud of?</p> <p>Boris\u2019s reply that it was too early to make international comparisons fell hopelessly flat. How many people does he need to die \u2013 100,000? 200,000? \u2013 before he admits the UK response to the pandemic has been far worse than almost every other country in the world? If we had the mortality rates of South Korea or Germany, Boris would be the first person to sing his own praises. World-beating only cuts one way for Johnson.</p> <p>You could tell that Boris sensed he was getting away with it as Starmer moved on to the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/10/keir-starmer-tells-pm-to-take-responsibility-for-his-failures-on-schools\">failure to plan for children returning to school</a>. The familiar entitled confidence and swagger began to shine through. Out came the long words (\u201ctergiversation\u201d was reminiscent of a wannabe Will Self, only without the smack) as first he accused Starmer of being a rent-a-gob lawyer \u2013 a bit rich coming from someone who has been sacked from several jobs for lying \u2013 and then brazenly insisting it was basically Labour\u2019s fault that most children would not go back to school before September at the earliest.</p> <p>By now Starmer had run out of questions, so he had to just suck it up as Johnson began to ad lib like some bloated Mr Toad. The two-metre rule was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/englands-2-metre-distancing-rule-still-under-review\">under review</a> \u2013 as in would be dispensed with ASAP regardless of what the scientific advice happened to be \u2013 and the world would be returning to some kind of order. What was the point of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/uk-zoos-and-safari-parks-to-reopen-from-15-june\">reopening zoos</a> and theme parks if kids were stuck in schools unable to enjoy them?</p> <p>The Labour leader shook his head. He had missed a trick, but wouldn\u2019t be making the mistake of underestimating his opponent again. In the end it was the SNP\u2019s Kirsty Blackman who landed the most telling blow by asking the prime minister to condemn Donald Trump\u2019s response to the death of George Floyd. Boris couldn\u2019t even bring himself to equivocate, instead calling the US \u201ca bastion of peace and freedom\u201d. A response that confirmed what many people think he really believes: that when push comes to shove, Black Lives Don\u2019t Really Matter.</p> <p>After a couple of hours\u2019 shut-eye, Johnson was back on view \u2013 he\u2019d make a good exhibit in the sloth enclosure for next Monday\u2019s zoo reopenings \u2013 for the Downing Street press briefing. Here, once he had waffled his way through his big announcement that single people were now free to resume their affairs \u2013 who could he have had in mind? \u2013 things got noticeably more tricky for Boris than they had been at PMQs.</p> <p>Why had he been so disorganised in getting children back to school? \u201cUm ...\u201d said Boris. He\u2019d have liked to get children back sooner but that would have meant a level of planning and preparation of which his government was completely incapable. Besides, it had been impossible to predict you could only get 15 kids in a classroom even though everyone had been saying just that for months. In any case, the UK wasn\u2019t doing noticeably worse on schools than any other countries. Here was one international comparison he was happy to make.</p> <p>Boris initially dodged the more telling question raised by Prof Neil Ferguson earlier in the afternoon that the UK could have halved its death rate by introducing lockdown a week earlier, instead letting Patrick Vallance and Chris Whitty take the flak. Both advisers are now showing worrying signs of having gone over to the dark side. Vallance merely played for time by talking of a range of different scenarios while Whitty initially answered a completely different question to the one asked, before his integrity kicked in. Eventually, though, after repeated questioning on the same subject, Boris was backed into a corner by Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby, who asked if there was something he regretted. Anything he might have done differently. The prime minister merely hummed and hawed.</p> <p>\u201cBut you take the decisions,\u201d Rigby insisted. This seemed to come as news to Boris. He hadn\u2019t realised that was part of the job description and scuttled out of the room as soon as was indecently possible. Not to be seen again for another week.</p>",

  "<p>In the aftermath of the removal of the statue of 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, the future of other sculptures, buildings and street names across the country is the subject of increasingly heated debate.</p> <p>On Tuesday, a statue of slave trader Robert Milligan was removed at West India Quay in London by landowners the Canal and River Trust. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/sadiq-khan-orders-review-of-all-london-statues-for-slavery-links\">announced a review</a> of all statues in London, while Labour councils across the country <a href=\"https://labourlist.org/2020/06/labour-councils-pledge-to-review-all-statues-and-commemorations-in-their-areas/\">committed to similar studies in their areas</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec05c2aa6cf838ebdf0b8ff9d8c7a4e630ae6f66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec05c2aa6cf838ebdf0b8ff9d8c7a4e630ae6f66/0_44_1606_963/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A statue of Scottish slaveholder Robert Milligan being removed from West India Quay, east London on Wednesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A statue of Scottish slaveholder Robert Milligan being removed from West India Quay, east London on Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tower Hamlets council/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/protesters-rally-in-oxford-for-removal-of-cecil-rhodes-statue\">1,000 protesters in Oxford renewed a prominent 2016 campaign</a> for the removal of a statue of Cecil Rhodes, a 19th-century businessman and politician who supported apartheid-style measures in southern Africa, from Oriel College \u2013 and drew the support of the local council leader.</p> <p>With petitions and social media campaigns proliferating, activists put together a website, <a href=\"https://www.toppletheracists.org/\">Topple the Racists</a>, compiling more than 60 of the proposed removals. They range from acknowledged slave traders such as Elihu Yale to more controversial inclusions such as Robert Peel, viewed as the founder of modern policing in Britain.</p> <p>Dr Philip Ward-Jackson, a historian of public sculpture and former Conway librarian at the Courtauld Institute, said that he was not aware of a previous period where the UK\u2019s statuary had been under such scrutiny. \u201cIn Britain we have kept everything regardless of whether we approve of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThings have come down occasionally, but by and large unless it was because they were in such awful condition they have tended to remain.\u201d</p> <p>The list below details some of the historical figures commemorated through statues, street names and public buildings now under debate.</p> <h2><strong>Cecil Rhodes</strong></h2> <p>The Rhodes Must Fall campaign \u2013 which launched the debate over memorialising figures with links to racism in 2016 \u2013 was reignited in <strong>Oxford </strong>this week when activists again demanded the removal of a statue at the university\u2019s Oriel College. Rhodes, a leading colonial businessman and politician, was responsible for apartheid policies in southern Africa. He was also co-founder of the De Beers mining company and firmly believed in the superiority of the English over other nations. His defenders have pointed to the establishment in his will of the Rhodes scholarships \u2013 whose alumni include the former US president Bill Clinton and former Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull \u2013 at Oxford.</p> <p>The Oxford campaign now has the backing of the local council, while Oriel College says that it \u201ccontinues to debate and discuss the issues\u201d. A campaign group has also formed in <strong>Bishop\u2019s Stortford,</strong> gaining thousands of signatures for petitions calling for the Rhodes Art Complex and Rhodes Avenue to be renamed.</p> <h2>Sir Francis Drake</h2> <p>Drake, the famed Elizabethan explorer, and a vice-admiral in the fleet that defeated the Spanish Armada, was also a slave trader, making three voyages&nbsp;to Guinea and Sierra Leone that enslaved between 1,200 and 1,400 Africans between 1562 and 1567 \u2013 a figure that probably meant the deaths of around three times as many, according to contemporary estimates.</p> <p>A petition calling for the removal of statues in his honour in <strong>Tavistock </strong>and<strong> Plymouth</strong>, and demanding that schools better reflect his role in the slave trade, has gained more than 1,400 signatures. The local councils have stopped short of agreeing that the statues should be removed but both issued statements acknowledging \u201cthe great wrongs of the past\u201d. Plymouth\u2019s council leader, Tudor Evans, promised to ensure the monument was accompanied by information about Drake\u2019s role in the slave trade.</p> <h2><strong>Robert Clive</strong></h2> <p>Described by the historian William Dalrymple as an \u201cunstable sociopath\u201d, Clive of India was the first British governor of Bengal. Widely viewed as one of the key figures in Britain\u2019s exertion of control over India, his tenure in Bengal was tainted by corruption, and critics say his policies led to mass famine \u2013 killing around 10 million \u2013 even as he extracted huge taxes that made him a fortune.</p> <p>He is memorialised with statues in <strong>Shrewsbury</strong> and <strong>London</strong>. A petition calling for the removal of the Shrewsbury statue has attracted more than 7,000 signatures, prompting the council to say it will discuss the issue. The London monument will fall under the terms of a review of the city\u2019s statuary ordered by the mayor.</p> <h2><strong>Robert Peel</strong></h2> <p>Widely regarded as the founding father of modern policing, Robert Peel is memorialised in statues all over the UK, including in <strong>Manchester</strong>, <strong>Birmingham</strong>, <strong>Leeds, Bradford, Tamworth, Preston, Bury </strong>and<strong> Glasgow</strong>. Some campaigners have called for the removal of statues on that basis, with the Topple the Racists site arguing that he \u201ccreated the modern concept of policing, which has disproportionately targeted the poor and ethnic minorities worldwide for centuries\u201d \u2013 even as others say that his \u201cpolicing by consent\u201d model should not be linked to current anger at police.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdab9f93e48c71e9de4148bd9ec1d232eda37b19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdab9f93e48c71e9de4148bd9ec1d232eda37b19/102_142_2967_1781/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A statue of Sir Robert Peel in Bury, Greater Manchester\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A statue of Sir Robert Peel in Bury, Greater Manchester, which is on a list of statues that could be removed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other demands have confused Peel with his father of the same name, who opposed the abolition of the slave trade. Some councils have promised to review the issue while others have pointed to that confusion and suggested that no change is needed.</p> <h2>Redvers Buller</h2> <p>Buller was memorialised in a 1905 statue in <strong>Exeter</strong> because of stunning successes as a military leader during the second Boer war. But he also suffered stinging defeats, leading to the nickname \u201cReverse Buller\u201d and prompting one caustic verdict: \u201cAn admirable captain, an adequate major, a barely satisfactory colonel and a disastrous general.\u201d Disputed allegations that he played a part in the use of concentration camps have led to his statue being vandalised, with the local council leader now backing a review.</p> <h2>Sir Thomas Picton</h2> <p>Picton, a 19th-century slave owner, was remembered in the UK for his military successes before his death at the Battle of Waterloo. But he was branded \u201cthe Tyrant of Trinidad\u201d because of his brutal policies as governor of the island, where he made vast sums from the slave trade. He also admitted to ordering the torture of a 14-year-old girl, but his conviction was overturned.</p> <p>His statue now looks likely to be removed from City Hall in <strong>Cardiff</strong> after the council leader agreed with the lord mayor\u2019s request to remove it as it was an \u201caffront\u201d to black people. Another monument in <strong>Carmarthen</strong> is the subject of a petition with more than 1,000 names. The council leader, Emlyn Dole, has promised a council debate and subsequent decision.</p> <h2>Henry Dundas</h2> <p>Dundas, the first Viscount Melville, is memorialised at the 45-metre (150ft) Melville monument in <strong>Edinburgh</strong>, as well as in street names and public buildings in the city. He was a prominent Scottish politician, holding roles including home secretary and war secretary. But even at the time of its creation in 1821, the statue was described in the Scotsman as a \u201cmonument to servility\u201d. And it is now widely accepted that as home secretary Dundas played a key role in delaying the abolition of slavery by around 15 years \u2013 keeping 630,000 people in servitude.</p> <p>Campaigners have painted graffiti on the monument and signage on Dundas Street, while a statue of his son Robert Dundas was also defaced. The council has already agreed to put a plaque on the base of the Melville monument noting his role in the slave trade. But more than 6,000 people view that step as inadequate and have called for the statue to be removed as well as streets named in his honour and the former RBS headquarters Dundas House to be renamed (though the latter belonged to another family member, Lawrence Dundas).</p> <h2><strong>Thomas Guy</strong></h2> <p>A founder of Guy\u2019s hospital in south <strong>London</strong>, he made his fortune through owning a large number of shares in the South Sea Company, whose main purpose was to sell slaves to the Spanish colonies.</p> <p>A statue to Guy stands by the hospital and is owned by the hospital\u2019s charitable arm. Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS trust ruled out any renaming but said it would discuss the sculpture\u2019s future as part of Khan\u2019s review, adding: \u201cWe recognise and understand the anger felt by the black community, and are fully committed to playing our part in ending racism, discrimination and inequality.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 12 June 2020 to clarify the original ownership of Dundas House in Edinburgh. </p>",

  "<p>Starting in July, the new Israeli government has said that it intends to illegally annex large swathes of Palestinian land in the West Bank, which was militarily occupied in 1967. This would be the culmination of years of appropriation of land through the forced displacement of Palestinians and the illegal settlement of the West Bank and annexation of East Jerusalem. By annexing the West Bank, Israel would be taking over occupied Palestinian territory and making it an integral part of the Israeli state.<br>&nbsp;<br>Palestinian civil society has made a global call for \u201ceffective measures\u201d to be taken to stop this annexation happening. For the UK, this means we should by now, at the very least, be adhering to an ethical policy on all trade with Israel, with a particular focus on applying international law on settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories.

86 should be protected.</p> <p>BHP said ministerial consent for its section 18 application covered approximately 40 heritage sites.</p> <p>\u201cWe speak regularly with the Banjima community and have

And there\u2019s more radical reform, such as the popular call to \u201cdefund the police\u201d, meaning to divert funding poured into police departments to other community resources such as mental health services, social services and education.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cRight now, because those other services have been under-funded for years, all of that eventually falls to the police,\u201d Colbert explained. \u201cAnd that\u2019s way too many things for them to be doing. It\u2019s like in the Middle Ages: it wasn\u2019t a good idea that your barber was also your dentist and your surgeon. And saying \u2018defund the barber\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean no one\u2019s getting haircuts \u2014\u2013 although admittedly right now, no one\u2019s getting haircuts.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/09/trevor-noah-protests-black-lives-matter-late-night\">Trevor Noah on those doubting the protests: 'They\u2019re going to be eating their words'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating has dropped to 38%, according to the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/08/politics/cnn-poll-trump-biden-chaotic-week/index.html\">latest CNN poll</a>, and the president is \u201cdesperate to turn things around\u201d, to the point where he\u2019s reportedly considered delivering a speech to the nation on race and unity. \u201cYes, they\u2019re <em>considering</em> it \u2013 a heroic <em>contemplation</em> of the <em>possibility </em>of leadership,\u201d said Colbert. \u201cIt reminds me of Dr King\u2019s immortal words: \u2018I\u2019m thinking about having a dream.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>While Trump contemplated, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden spoke up, delivering a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UK1Sskf7EE\">moving virtual eulogy for George Floyd</a> at a memorial service in Houston on Tuesday. \u201cYou see, President Trump? It\u2019s possible to bring people to tears at church without having to release pepper spray,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cAnd the Vice-President did the one thing that the President fears the most: Biden didn\u2019t mention the name Donald Trump once. Let\u2019s hope very soon, we can all do the same.\u201d</p> <h2>Trevor Noah</h2> <p>On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah parsed the differences between the response by congressional Democrats and Republicans to the Black Lives Matter protests across the nation. Earlier this week, Democrats led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi kneeled in honor of George Floyd wearing kente cloths, an indigenous Ghanaian fabric. \u201cI understand the symbolic gesture of kneeling to remember George Floyd. What I don\u2019t understand is needing to dress like extras from Coming to America 2,\u201d said Noah, adding the gesture \u201cfelt like they were trying too hard\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1270545450156908547\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today in No, Not Like That: Team Trump brags about getting 8% of the Black vote while the Democrats dress like extras from Coming to America 2. <a href=\"https://t.co/OQqYGOk4zA\">pic.twitter.com/OQqYGOk4zA</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1270545450156908547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 10, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>\u201cNow, to be fair, the Democrats weren\u2019t just kneeling and wearing kente cloth,\u201d he said. \u201cThey also unveiled police reform legislation that would make some pretty big changes,\u201d such as banning no-knock warrants in drug cases, which allowed police to enter into the home and kill Breonna Taylor in Louisville in April, and make chokeholds a civil rights violation. And it would make it easier to prosecute police who use excessive force, which is virtually impossible now. \u201cLike now, you need to catch them on video, then have a [District Attorney] that\u2019s willing to prosecute them, then have a jury that actually wants to hold cops accountable,\u201d Noah explained. \u201cThen, after all that, you still need to find the cops Horcrux and destroy it, otherwise they just get to go right back out on the force.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Trump doubled down on his backing of police, telling reporters: \u201cI say 99.9, but let\u2019s go with 99% of [cops] are great, great people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, 99% of all police are great people. And I guess it\u2019s just unlucky that protesters happen to keep meeting with the bad 1% over, and over, and over again,\u201d said Noah over recent images of police brutality against protesters.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that all cops are bad. But the problems with the police are much more widespread than Trump is acknowledging,\u201d he continued. \u201cBecause every single time \u2013 every single time \u2013 a police department gets audited, or investigated, the results that come back time and time again show deep rot and systemic issues often from the top. It\u2019s like turning on a black light in a hotel room \u2013 there\u2019s no way you\u2019re only going to find one stain.\u201d</p> <h2>Jimmy Kimmel</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg7ASRLdsB0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tg7ASRLdsB0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel responded to reports that Trump has dismissed polls placing him behind Biden as false. \u201cIf you think he won\u2019t contest the election if he loses \u2013 he won\u2019t even accept the meaningless poll he\u2019s losing,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to drag him out of that White House by his heels.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt makes sense that Trump doesn\u2019t get it. He\u2019s like a lot of soft-brained 73-year-old men who watch nothing but Fox News,\u201d Kimmel continued, cutting to Tucker Carlson arguing on Fox News that America is not a racist country. \u201cRight, but didn\u2019t you want to build a wall to keep those immigrants out of \u2026 oh, nevermind. He\u2019s right! America\u2019s fine, we have no problems at all,\u201d Kimmel deadpanned. \u201cThose people marching in the streets? They\u2019re just getting exercise.\u201d</p> <p>Kimmel also touched on Trump\u2019s propagation of a conspiracy theory that Martin Gugino, the 75-year-old man in serious condition with a skull fracture after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/buffalo-officers-filmed-shoving-75-year-old-protester-charged-with-assault\">Buffalo police shoved him to the ground</a> during a protest last week, is an Antifa covert agent. \u201cJust to recap, the theory here is that a 75-year-old man was using his cell phone to scan police communication equipment in order to black it out,\u201d Kimmel explained. \u201cI think anyone who\u2019s tried to Zoom with their grandparents knows there\u2019s no possible way that\u2019s true.

  "<h2><strong>10. </strong>Titanic Memorial, Belfast</h2> <p>The ship, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1912/apr/16/leadersandreply.mainsection\">which sank in 1912</a> with more than 1,500 souls drowned, has become a symbol of the precariousness of existence. It is commemorated by this marble monument in the city where the doomed ocean liner was built. A female mythological figure of Fate looms over a drowning sailor held in a mermaid\u2019s embrace. Created by sculptor Thomas Brock and erected in 1920, it\u2019s a passionate exception to the often tight-lipped statuary of imperial Britain.</p> <h2><strong>9. </strong>Robert Burns, Edinburgh</h2> <p>A contemporary of William Blake and the rustic bard himself, John Flaxman is a forgotten genius of British sculpture. His statue of Scotland\u2019s national poet was commissioned in 1824 for a rotunda on Edinburgh\u2019s Calton Hill. Today this intense Romantic homage to the poet as hero is kept in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, but it is worth climbing the hill to appreciate its original lofty location. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67e426ca9e8e34fbd9c3c9719398f276b70a8fdd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67e426ca9e8e34fbd9c3c9719398f276b70a8fdd/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clockwise from top left: Belfast\u2019s Titanic Memorial, Robert Burns, Winston Churchill, the River God,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clockwise from top left: Belfast\u2019s Titanic Memorial, Robert Burns, Winston Churchill, the River God,</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Getty Images, Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>8. </strong>Winston Churchill, London</h2> <p>Maybe one reason why this statue has become a magnet for graffiti is that it is such a striking presence in Parliament Square. A duller statue would attract less attention. For some, Churchill is a racist responsible for the 1943 Bengal famine; for others, he\u2019s the war hero who saved Britain and defeated Hitler and his murderous doctrine of racial hate. However Churchill is seen, this statue won\u2019t let us forget him. It is a truly characterful work of art. Not for him the proud, upright stance, full of strength and absent of doubt, so common in lesser statues. This is a much more complex, much less celebratory monument, capturing the aged politician hunched over \u2013 weighed down by events, perhaps even by his own conscience and his regrets \u2013 but still strong, still standing. There is more than a touch of Rodin\u2019s expressiveness about it. Ivor Roberts-Jones gave his brooding masterpiece a scale and mass that holds its own among the spires of Westminster, the seat of British power once wielded by this man. It is a statue that magnificently expresses the colossal place of Churchill in British history, and the many sides of the man \u2013 a shielding or oppressive work, depending on your perception of Britain\u2019s most famous war leader.</p> <h2><strong>7. </strong>Hodge the Cat, London</h2> <p>This statue by&nbsp;sculptor Jon Bickley pays homage to a very privileged cat. Hodge belonged to the ebullient dictionary writer and 18th-century wit Samuel Johnson, who fed his pet solely on oysters. He didn\u2019t want his servants to resent looking after a cat so he himself went to get fresh oysters from street-sellers every day. Hodge is included in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.talkingstatueslondon.co.uk/statues/hodge/\">the Talking Statues project</a>, so you can hear him tell his own fat-cat story.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>6. </strong>River God, Stourhead</h2> <p>This fantastical marble statue of a classical deity drips watery encrustations and emanates the mysterious power of nature. You\u2019ll find it in the dark and dreamlike Grotto at Stourhead, Wiltshire. The 18th-century gardens are the setting of an ambitious array of public sculpture intended to educate the nation. Inspired by the art of Renaissance Italy, this garden god takes you out of the ordinary into the sublime. </p> <h2><strong>5. </strong>Millicent Fawcett, London</h2> <p>Famous for her photographs of people in the street holding up signs saying what they\u2019re thinking, Gillian Wearing brings an unpretentious&nbsp;touch to this suffragette memorial in Parliament Square. Fawcett isn\u2019t portrayed in some florid monumental way but as someone just like us, who happened to do something brave. She even has one of Wearing\u2019s signs to share her message. </p> <h2><strong>4. </strong>Another Place, Merseyside</h2> <p>They are neither heroes nor antiheroes. We don\u2019t know what they may have done or are capable of doing. Innocent or evil, oppressed or oppressors, the figures placed on a Merseyside beach by sculptor Antony Gormley are none of these things. They are just human beings. Returning to prehistory for inspiration, Gormley creates universal, open images of our common nature. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"792b227ca4965650a3223c5e423a203777ed137d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/792b227ca4965650a3223c5e423a203777ed137d/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clockwise from top left: Millicent Fawcett , Antony Gormley\u2019s figures on Crosby Beach, the Marquess of Anglesey\u2019s Column, Rodin\u2019s Burghers of Calais.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clockwise from top left: Millicent Fawcett , Antony Gormley\u2019s figures on Crosby Beach, the Marquess of Anglesey\u2019s Column, Rodin\u2019s Burghers of Calais.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Getty Images, Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>3. </strong>Marquess of Anglesey\u2019s Column, Anglesey</h2> <p>You can barely see the statue of Henry William Paget, Marquess of Anglesey, on top of his tall column, but this monument \u2013 soaring over leafy trees and green water \u2013 is still one of Britain\u2019s most memorable. It shows Anglesey leaning on a stick, a reference to the fact that when this commander in the Napoleonic wars was chatting to the Duke of Wellington at Waterloo, a cannonball tore off his leg.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>2. </strong>Rodin\u2019s Burghers of Calais, London</h2> <p>This compassionate masterpiece asks us to feel for the oppressed. The six citizens of Calais who offered their lives for their town in the Hundred Years War become universal figures of human suffering in Rodin\u2019s expressive hands. As they gesture their supplication in poses that embody a powerful range of moods, from silent dignity to tragic eloquence, they bear witness to history\u2019s crimes and speak for all victims.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>1. </strong>Verity, Ilfracombe</h2> <p>There\u2019s no danger of Damien Hirst\u2019s colossal bronze bisected woman ever fading into the background as so many statues do. She towers over Ilfracombe harbour in Devon, raising a sword skyward for even more height. Hirst explores his obsessive theme of our secret inner anatomy with echoes of Leonardo da Vinci and no regard for anyone\u2019s idea of good taste. This stupefying statue doesn\u2019t commemorate some famous person. Instead, it looks inside us all.&nbsp;<br></p>",
  "<p>The medley of jubilant black, brown and white faces cheering the destruction of Edward Colston\u2019s statue has had many rethinking. Discussing even. Britain, a nation not keen on making much of a fuss, is having to talk about slavery. For too long we would rather have dunked our digestives into mugs of tea and not bothered with dredging up our past. But what if we had all learned at school that <a href=\"https://www.futurity.org/tea-british-empire-1536862-2/\">the history of our great British brew</a> is inseparable from our history of empire? While Brits have been embracing lockdown baking, how many will know our national sweet tooth is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/oct/13/lifeandhealth.britishidentity\">the direct result of slave labour on Caribbean sugar cane fields</a>?</p> <p>At this moment, remaining ignorant about such history looks increasingly indefensible. Overnight, it has become a moral imperative to learn both the good and bad of British history. Meanwhile support for organisations that have long been working on \u201cdecolonising the curriculum\u201d has skyrocketed since the killing of George Floyd.</p> <p><a href=\"http://decolonisethecurriculum.com/\">Pran Patel</a>, a consultant on decolonising the curriculum for schools in the UK and beyond, says that over the past two weeks the interest in his work from headteachers has been \u201ccrazy\u201d. For Patel, decolonising the curriculum means exposing kids to the richness of knowledge from what he calls the \u2018\u201cglobal curriculum\u201d. Denying children a wider range of subjects and perspectives does them a disservice. So too does a lack of consideration for how material is taught and who is teaching it.</p> <p>\u201cOur curriculum leaves&nbsp;some of us feeling inferior and others, through no fault of their own, superior,\u201d says Patel. \u201cNobody wins in that scenario. When we teach literature, we should be teaching Dickens but we should also be talking about Tagore. When we teach poetry, we should absolutely be teaching Shakespeare and his sonnets but also Rumi.\u201d</p> <p>Signs declaring \u201cWhite silence is violence\u201d on our streets and social media feeds have forced thousands to act. According to Penny Rabiger, an ex-teacher and member of the <a href=\"http://www.bameednetwork.com/about-us/\">Black and Minority Ethnic Educators Network</a>, this \u201chuge collective white guilt\u201d has led to an enormous volume of traffic to the network\u2019s website. A lot of white educators are logging on and asking how they can bring more diversity into their classrooms. How, too, they want to know, do they start having conversations about race and racial inequality with young people?&nbsp;Rabiger hits a cautious note, though, when she says: \u201cWhite guilt is dangerous. It\u2019s a start but it\u2019s not going to \u2018fix\u2019 racism\u2019.\u201d White educators must, she says, continually ask themselves how racial inequality comes to exist and in what ways they perpetuate it.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We saw the same euphoria after the Mark Duggan shooting but once the anger dies down, the energy to participate dies too</p> <footer> <cite>Brother Nia Imara</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When I first speak to Lavinya Stennett, the founder of <a href=\"https://www.theblackcurriculum.com/\">The Black Curriculum</a>, it is lunchtime but she has only minutes to spare. She is in back-to-back meetings till 6pm. Has she noticed an increase of support over the past two weeks? She gives a tired laugh. In the week before Floyd\u2019s death, her website, which details the implicit racial bias of the curriculum, received nearly 1,500 visits. Last week, the figure jumped to 133,000. On Monday, the social enterprise had 1,500 Twitter followers; three days later, that number had ballooned to 80,000.&nbsp;</p> <p>Thousands of teachers and parents are logging on to download its teaching resources. England\u2019s national curriculum, drastically redesigned by Michael Gove and Dominic Cummings during the former\u2019s tenure as secretary for education, controversially celebrated the achievements of the empire while<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/black-history-month-colonialism-history-teacher-whitewashing-selective-past-a8025741.html\"> downplaying the sordid details of how it was run</a>. This is why, in its latest report, The Black Curriculum is demanding that the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, makes black histories mandatory in the national curriculum. Those deluging them with requests clearly agree.</p> <p>For Stennet, the increased exposure is \u201cbittersweet\u201d. She is grateful for the support but is also exhausted. She wants to know that the outpouring of goodwill will last beyond the next weeks and months.&nbsp;</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nabss.org.uk/\">National Association of Black Supplementary Schools</a> (NABSS) was set up in 2007 by Brother Nia Imara, who says he wanted to challenge a media narrative of black children\u2019s underachievement.

  "<p>The director of public prosecutions, Max Hill, is being threatened with legal action over the failure to investigate Dominic Cummings for alleged breaches of the lockdown rules.</p> <p>A legal team, headed by the barrister Michael Mansfield, has twice written to Hill, expressing concern that no action has yet been taken against Cummings after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/22/dominic-cummings-durham-trip-coronavirus-lockdown\">Guardian and Daily Mirror investigation</a> revealed the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser travelled with his family to Durham and Barnard Castle during the lockdown.</p> <p>The letters were sent on 3 and 8 June on behalf of Martin Redston, a 70-year-old London engineer who is concerned that the lockdown laws should apply to everyone irrespective of their position in government.</p> <p>Replying to Redston\u2019s second letter, Hill\u2019s office confirmed his complaint had been passed to a special crime division of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and a full response would follow in \u201cdue course\u201d. But it stopped short of saying the matter was being actively considered, as requested by Redston\u2019s legal team, which also includes the firm Hackett &amp; Dabbs.</p> <p>In a new letter to Hill sent on Tuesday, Redston\u2019s lawyers claim the failure to provide a substantive response were grounds for a judicial review. And it threatened to begin proceedings if no action is taken by Hill by 4pm on Thursday 11 June.</p> <p>The letter said the demand for urgency was \u201cproportionate\u201d given \u201ca very serious loss of public confidence in the due process of the rule of law\u201d at a time of a continued public health emergency that requires public compliance. It also warned any delay risked losing evidence such as CCTV footage and credit card records relating to Cummings\u2019 movements in the north-east.</p> <p>The letter also pointed out that in his statement from the rose garden of Downing Street, Cummings admitted returning to work at No 10 on 27 March after tending to his wife who was displaying symptoms of coronavirus. He then admitted travelling to Durham with his wife to seek childcare for their four-year-old son, the letter pointed out.</p> <p>A spokesman for Hill and the CPS said: \u201cWe have responded to the letter today referring those involved to the relevant police force as investigating alleged offences is a matter for the police not the CPS.\u201d</p> <p>Redston\u2019s lawyers point out that under the CPS\u2019s own policy it may receive an allegation of an offence from a member of the public and can refer such cases to the police.</p> <p>Redston, whose complaint is being funded by donations to Crowd Justice, said: \u201cThe prime minister was absolutely unequivocal when he said people needed to \u2018Stay at home, Protect the NHS and Save Lives\u2019. The rules were entirely clear and should apply to everyone.\u201d</p> <p>He said he was prevented from attending a friend\u2019s funeral due to the lockdown restrictions. And he has also been unable to see his grandchildren since the start of the outbreak.</p> <p>After recovering from coronavirus, Cummings admitted travelling to Barnard Castle with his family on 12 April to test his eyesight.</p> <p>An initial three-day investigation by Durham police into Cummings\u2019 travels found that he might have breached health protection regulations when he took a 52-mile round trip to the town.</p> <p>But it said Cummings\u2019 516-mile round trip from London to Durham and back had not broken health protection regulations. The force decided to take no further action after making no finding in relation to \u201cstay at home\u201d government guidance.</p> <p>On Sunday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/07/dominic-cummings-call-for-new-investigation-into-durham-trip\">a separate campaign for a new investigation into Cummings</a> over alleged breaches was launched, by lawyers with the backing of health workers and some families of coronavirus victims.</p> <p>\u2022 The headline of this article was amended on 11 June 2020 because an earlier version referred to the director of public prosecutions as the \u201cUK\u2019s top prosecutor\u201d.

  "<p>When the slave trader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">Edward Colston\u2019s statue</a> was sent tumbling into the harbour in Bristol on Sunday, it was easy to anticipate that the event would be folded into Britain\u2019s febrile culture war surrounding colonialism and empire, and easier still to foresee the kinds of commentary it would arouse on the right.</p> <p>A broad spectrum of reasons this was a Bad Thing was immediately brought to bear, from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/08/keir-starmer-edward-colston-bristol-statue-wrong\">relatively sensible</a> (it would have been better to bring the statue down through democratic process, as indeed campaigners had been trying to do for years); to the equivocatory (Colston should be left on his plinth as testament to the complexity of history, his trade in human lives having been balanced out somewhat by his civic philanthropy); to the historically illiterate (Colston, being a man of his time, should not be judged for trading in human lives).</p> <p>As the campaign against statues has widened, the right\u2019s response has been to cast it as a totalitarian campaign against history itself: hence the&nbsp;Mail\u2019s borderline demented headline of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-the-papers-52988233\">Toppling the past</a>\u201d, and its comparison of Black Lives Matter to Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution. But what has begun to emerge most worryingly from the comment pages and talking heads is an implicit narrative that has been creeping ever more insistently into the debate about history, memory and education in this country: the spectre of racial replacement.</p> <p>\u201cThe great replacement\u201d owes its current name to the French far-right writer and activist Renaud Camus, who formulated it in his 2011 book&nbsp;Le Grand Remplacement. Camus\u2019s main argument was that the \u201cindigenous\u201d white population of France was being replaced by North African and Muslim migration at the behest of \u201creplacist elites\u201d in government and international institutions such as the EU, and their intellectual handmaidens.</p> <p>As a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Replacement\">conspiracy theory</a>, however, it has a long pedigree and a wide variety of forms. Its basic contours are this: \u201cindigenous\u201d white populations, and their cultures, societies and institutions, are being replaced by a tide of racial others \u2013 Black people, Africans and Muslims. Moreover, this is happening not because of any natural demographic trend, but because enemies within have willed it, not only through weakness but through a suicidal, self-hating malice towards the civilisation of which they are a part. </p> <p>Although no mainstream British figure is yet to commit explicitly to the great replacement as a conspiracy theory, its essential features haunt the language of the right\u2019s culture wars. Broadcaster <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/were-giving-in-to-the-race-revolutionaries-csx59n7g8\">Melanie Phillips\u2019 piece </a>on the Colston statue in Monday\u2019s&nbsp;Times&nbsp;is as good an example as any.&nbsp;Headlined \u201cWe\u2019re giving in to the race revolutionaries\u201d, Phillips\u2019 piece took aim at the \u201cspineless reaction\u201d of the authorities to protesters\u2019 attacks on statues and memorials \u2013 not simply because lawbreaking should be punished but because, she argued, the protesters\u2019 aims and motivations were inherently antithetical to our society itself.</p> <p>\u201cThey are accusing the police and white society of being fundamentally evil,\u201d she wrote; \u201cthese demonstrations have been a form of insurrection against western society and its institutions\u201d. Let\u2019s pass over, for moment, that easy slippage from \u201cwhite society\u201d to \u201cwestern society\u201d, and move on to the next bit: \u201cOn both sides of the Atlantic, this mayhem is the result of decades of appeasing those determined to bring down western culture \u2026 Deeming western culture to be racist and colonialist, the education establishment set out to teach instead that black people were the inescapable victims of white society.\u201d</p> <p>This is a familiar refrain, especially when it comes to education: Toby Young, for example, has written that British universities have become \u201c<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-6075017/TOBY-YOUNG-no-wonder-degrees-going-fashion.html\">leftwing madrassas</a>\u201d. </p> <p>When in 2017 Lola Olufemi, the then women\u2019s officer at Cambridge University Students\u2019 Union, wrote to the university\u2019s English faculty recommending that the curriculum be broadened to include more non-white authors, the Daily Telegraph put a picture of her on its front cover beneath the heading \u201c<a href=\"https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/telegraph-corrects-story-saying-cambridge-university-would-drop-white-authors-from-reading-lists/\">Student forces Cambridge to drop white authors</a>\u201d \u2013 an inaccuracy, as the Telegraph was forced to admit.</p> <p>But the passage from putting non-white authors on reading lists to replacing white ones was an easy one to make, and a potent way of stirring up a sense that white culture is being not simply eroded but replaced, intentionally, and with the aim of destroying it. As Phillips has <a href=\"https://standpointmag.co.uk/issues/march-2018/features-march-2018-melanie-phillips-judaism-the-onslaught-against-moral-codes/\">written elsewhere</a>, \u201cWar is being waged against western culture from within\u201d. This is not a difficult sentiment to find replicated on a daily basis, either in the fever-swamps of the online right or the comment pages of respectable newspapers.</p> <p>The narrative goes that decadent liberals \u2013 \u201cthe education establishment\u201d [sic] for Phillips, rootless \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/39a0867a-0974-11e7-ac5a-903b21361b43\">anywheres</a>\u201d according to journalist David Goodhart, or \u201ccultural Marxists\u201d in the words of attorney general Suella Braverman and various rightwing commentators \u2013 are a fifth column intent on pulling down the whole fa\u00e7ade of western civilisation and letting the barbarian hordes in. In many variants, this enemy within is Jewish: this is what the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/12/nazi-white-nationalist-rallies-virginia-protests\">Unite the Right</a> protesters at Charlottesville meant, in 2017, as they marched against the removal of a statue of the confederate general Robert E Lee, chanting \u201cJews will not replace us\u201d. It\u2019s also what lies behind much of the rhetoric on the far right, popularised in Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Hungary and consistently flirted with by senior Tories, casting the Jewish financier George Soros as a dedicated enemy of European national cultures.</p> <p>That these kinds of narratives inspire violence is no surprise: after all, if the fight is existential, what means are off the table? One recent adherent of replacement theory is thought to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/27/pittsburgh-shooting-suspect-antisemitism\">Robert </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/27/pittsburgh-shooting-suspect-antisemitism\">Bowers</a>, the suspect in the killing of 11 people at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018. <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/why-the-tree-of-life-shooter-was-fixated-on-the-hebrew-immigrant-aid-society\">Bowers </a>is said to have written that the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, a Jewish refugee charity, \u201clikes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can\u2019t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I\u2019m going in.\u201d</p> <p>Another is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/07/anders-behring-breivik-indicted-norway\">Anders Behring Breivik</a>, whose fantasies about \u201cEuropean genocide\u201d led him to murder 77 people, mostly youth members of the Norwegian labour party attending a summer camp, in 2011. Breivik quoted Melanie Phillips in his manifesto: challenged on this, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/39a0867a-0974-11e7-ac5a-903b21361b43\">Phillips responded</a> that the revelation had \u201cthe left in general wetting itself in delirium at this apparently heaven-sent opportunity to take down those who fight for life, liberty and western civilisation against those who would destroy it\u201d \u2013 reproducing, of course, Breivik\u2019s concerns almost exactly.</p> <p>What this kind of rhetoric is supposed to accomplish is open to question, but its effects are plain to see. Before Sunday was out, an association of football fans in Plymouth had posted a chilling photo of themselves standing on the steps of a war memorial to \u201cdefend\u201d it from BLM protesters; Stephen Yaxley-Lennon (AKA Tommy Robinson) and the <a href=\"https://www.hopenothate.org.uk/2020/06/08/football-hooligans-and-far-right-plan-london-demonstration/\">Democratic Football Lads\u2019 Alliance</a> have announced their intention to come to London en masse this weekend to make sure that the monuments of our national heritage are defended from \u2013 well, by now you know who from.

  "<h2><strong>REMEMBERING UPWARDLY MOBILE DAVID MOYES ... AND MR ROY!</strong></h2> \n<p>It\u2019s nearly 10 years since Everton beat Liverpool. Tim Cahill and Mikel Arteta were the matchwinners at Goodison Park back in October 2010, as Mr Roy stood on the touchline, stroking his chin in the intellectual style, trying extremely hard to look like he was mentally processing complex tactical data and was not in any way whatsoever being slowly consumed by doubt followed by a thundering professional breakdown. By contrast, over in the other dugout, David Moyes cut a dash. Here was a manager going places, a highly regarded talent in total control, right at the top of his game. Yes sir, he really looked like he knew what he was doing.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/10/merseyside-derby-given-go-ahead-to-be-staged-at-goodison\">Merseyside derby given go-ahead to be staged at Goodison Park</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Different times, different times. \u201cWe didn\u2019t score goals and Everton did, but I refuse to accept that we were in any way inferior,\u201d Mr Roy insisted after the chasing. \u201cThe second half was as good as I saw a Liverpool team play under my management that is for sure!\u201d Given that his team were joint bottom of the Premier League, nobody bothered to respond to a setup that didn\u2019t require a punchline. Watching on in the stands were members of New England Sports Ventures, who had bought Liverpool the previous day. \u201cWe have got our work cut out,\u201d principal investor John Henry sighed. \u201cThis is not going to be easy.\u201d Oh Mr Roy! How could you?!</p> \n<p>But just as a week is a long time in politics, 10 years is a long time in time. And who on that sunny Saturday lunchtime would have seriously thought that now, in 2020, Everton would still be a garden-variety mid-table non-event, or that Moyes would be on his fifth post-Goodison job, broken, with the haunted eyes of a man trying extremely hard to look like he was mentally processing complex tactical data and was not in any way whatsoever being slowly consumed by doubt followed by a thundering professional breakdown? Well, OK, but you\u2019d have got good odds on Liverpool being 25 points clear at the top with nine games left to play, you\u2019ve got to give us that at least.</p> \n<p>And now, at the end of a long narrative arc that we\u2019ve pulled from our nether regions, with some discomfort it has to be said, Liverpool could potentially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/10/merseyside-derby-given-go-ahead-to-be-staged-at-goodison\">wrap up the title at Goodison on 21 June</a>. That\u2019d require second-placed Manchester City to lay a large egg at home against Arsenal four days earlier, and The Fiver hasn\u2019t forgotten what the Gunners are all about, so it\u2019s fairly unlikely. But it is theoretically possible, especially now the fixture has been given the go-ahead to be staged at Everton\u2019s famous old pile. There you go, the top line hidden away at the end of the fourth paragraph. A new Fiver record!</p> \n<p>Everton fans won\u2019t relish the prospect. But if it does present itself, at least they won\u2019t have to go through the rigmarole of boycotting the match and flogging their tickets on Stubhub, something many fans were preparing to do before football was suspended. If it doesn\u2019t, Liverpool\u2019s next chance to wrap up the title could come along at home to Crystal Palace, who are of course managed by ... no, The Fiver can\u2019t begin to think about the myriad comedic possibilities of that one quite yet.</p> \n<h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> \n<p>\u201cPeople have spoken brilliantly over the last week \u2013 people like Troy Townsend,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/07/britains-sporting-apartheid-must-end-says-sport-englands-chris-grant\" title=\"\">Chris Grant</a>&nbsp;and David Olusoga.

It is now closed to all but permanent citizens and residents, all of whom have to quarantine in a hotel under supervision upon arrival. New Zealand attempted self-quarantine but it was flouted.</p> \n<p>The UK has not enforced quarantine until now and has kept its border open to arrivals throughout the pandemic.

She saw herself as a poet and a painter. Between shifts at the New York bookstore where she worked, Smith would perform readings of her verse at small clubs alongside Lenny Kaye, who provided blasts of feedback on guitar. Smith and Pearlman became friends anyway; four years later, she finally his took advice and made the landmark punk album Horses. REM\u2019s Michael Stipe later said it \u201ctore my limbs off and put them back on in a whole new order\u201d.</p> <p>Punk is rarely noted for its literary qualities, though Smith was unapologetic in her love of the French poets Genet, Baudelaire and Rimbaud. Her songwriting on Horses revelled in intricate phrasing and imagery, and deliberately blurred the lines between punk and poetry. It also stuck two fingers up at punk\u2019s self-imposed two-minute rule \u2013&nbsp;a response to prog\u2019s perceived self-indulgence \u2013 with some tracks exceeding nine minutes.</p> <p>Gloria (In Excelsis Deo), a re-working of a Them song, with its immortal first line \u201cJesus died for somebody\u2019s sins but not mine\u201d, remains the perfect encapsulation of Smith\u2019s spirit: transgressive, hypnotic, determinedly true to herself and her art. At a time when women musicians were expected to trade on their femininity, there was nothing pretty about her delivery. It was urgent, often incantatory, given to stretching vowels (\u201cpeople say \u2018bewaaaaaaare\u2019, but I don\u2019t caaaaaaare\u201d) and turning them into sneers. Elsewhere, there are tales of suicide (Redondo Beach), an alien visitation (Birdland), a lightning storm (Kimberly) and a boy who breaks out of his skin and flies away (Break it Up), many of them incendiary and intense, and anchored by the spiky garage rock of the era.</p> <p>Similarly arresting was the famous cover photograph, taken by her then-partner <a href=\"Robert%20Mapplethorpe\">Robert Mapplethorpe</a>, depicting an androgynous Smith in a white shirt, her jacket slung Sinatra-style over her shoulder and looking insolently into the camera. When Smith\u2019s label Arista asked that she airbrush out the hair on her upper lip, they might just as well have asked her to put on a spangly dress and a wig. She declined.</p> <h2>The three to check out next</h2> <p><strong>Easter (1978)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_BcivBprM0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c_BcivBprM0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Patti Smith: Because the Night \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>If Horses gave the impression that Smith\u2019s path would be unyieldingly left-field, her third LP set us straight. Produced by Jimmy Iovine, who would go on to work with U2 and Dire Straits, Easter was, by comparison, polished and accessible, and yielded a bona fide hit in Because the Night, a joyful, air-punching ode to hedonism and love \u2013 more Pat Benatar than Baudelaire. The song, partly written by Bruce Springsteen who happened to be recording down the corridor from Smith, irked some fans who accused her of selling out, but she didn\u2019t care. \u201cI liked hearing myself on the radio,\u201d she told New York Magazine. \u201cTo me, those people didn\u2019t understand punk rock at all. Punk rock is just another word for freedom.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Gone Again (1996)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYnneOm1YfE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gYnneOm1YfE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Patti Smith: Gone Again \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Smith took much of the 80s and 90s out to raise her two children, a decision she has said came easily given her reluctance as a rock star. But then a series of deaths brought her back to songwriting, including that of her friend and former partner Robert Mapplethorpe in 1989, and her husband, the MC5 guitarist Fred \u201cSonic\u201d Smith, her brother Todd, and her friend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kurt-cobain\">Kurt Cobain</a>, who all died in 1994. Unusually confessional, and more subtle and folksy than her previous works, Gone Again is a stunning elegy to those she lost as well as a document of her path to healing.</p> <p><strong>Banga (2012)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpyRxGrDrPE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PpyRxGrDrPE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Patti Smith: Banga \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>As you move through her career, Smith\u2019s albums become increasingly hit and miss, though even the misses have their moments, each bearing testament to her dedication to profundity and poeticism. Banga, her 11th album, has no duds. The pleasingly in-your-face title track comes from the Russian novelist Mikhail Bulgakov\u2019s The Master and Margarita and features dogs barking in the background, while Constantine\u2019s Dream is inspired by Piero della Francesca\u2019s fresco sequence The History of the True Cross. Loosely themed around the concept of exploration, the album brims with poetic rapture, and is interspersed with tender songs such as April Fool, in which lovers \u201crace through alleyways in tattered coats\u201d and This Is the Girl, a sweet tribute to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/amywinehouse\">Amy Winehouse</a>.</p> <h2>One for the heads</h2> <p><strong>Piss Factory (1974)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxJRLwbotFI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rxJRLwbotFI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Patti Smith: Piss Factory \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/19/patti-smtih-reading-mark-twain-gave-me-anxiety\">Patti Smith: \u2018Reading Mark Twain gave me such anxiety I threw up\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The infamous B-side to Smith\u2019s first single was her first fully-fledged \u201crock\u2019n\u2019roll poem\u201d.

Piss Factory is mostly spoken rather than sung, the words delivered against improvised, often frenzied piano. It tells of the futility of the job, the foul conditions and the workers who \u201cgot no teeth or gum or cranium\u201d. Smith didn\u2019t see eye to eye with her colleagues, who were incensed by the copy of Rimbaud\u2019s Illuminations in her pocket and instructed her to leave it at home.

Liverpool\u2019s mayor, Joe Anderson, thanked both clubs for making it clear to supporters that their presence at or near the ground would not be welcome.</p> <p>Councillor Wendy Simon, the deputy mayor of Liverpool and chair of the council\u2019s safety advisory group, said: \u201cWe are satisfied that the considerable evidence provided by the government, Everton and Liverpool football clubs, public health colleagues and Merseyside police will ensure that the outstanding fixtures for the Premier League season can be safely and securely played at both Goodison Park and Anfield.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of factors have been taken into consideration, especially the safety of the players, match officials and staff. We are confident the measures in place will allow the matches to be held behind closed doors without detrimental impact. We would advise that everyone, wherever they may be watching these fixtures, strongly adhere to the guidance on social distancing.\u201d<br><br>With regard to the derby, which will be broadcast free to air, the Merseyside assistant chief constable, Rob Carden, said: \u201cWorking together with both teams, we want to ensure everyone enjoys the game from the safety of their own home. In relation to crime and disorder we have no objections to any of the home fixtures being played at their respective grounds, the main concern was always public health.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not the role of the police to make operational decisions on the basis of public health, we have been guided by experts and the government. We are still in unprecedented times and there are strong concerns in Merseyside and the wider north-west due to the fact the R-rate here is still higher than in the rest of the country. For that reason we would urge supporters to do the right thing \u2013 stay at home and keep your family, friends and neighbours safe.\u201d</p> <p>The supporters\u2019 groups Blue Union and Spirit of Shankly were represented at the safety group meeting and welcomed the decision. A statement said: \u201cBuilding on the magnificent community work both sets of fans have done throughout this pandemic, we are confident supporters will respect safety advice and avoid visiting stadia. We fully understand the importance of lockdown as a measure to control Covid-19 and would encourage fans to stay away.\u201d</p> <p>Everton have confirmed that Theo Walcott will miss the restart after undergoing abdominal surgery.

  "<p>Swedish authorities have closed their 34-year investigation into the unsolved murder of prime minister Olof Palme, naming a graphic designer at an insurance company as the probable killer but saying he could not be prosecuted because he was now dead.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t get around one person as the perpetrator: he is Stig Engstr\u00f6m,\u201d the chief prosecutor, Krister Petersson, who took over one of the world\u2019s most infamous cold cases in 2017, told a new conference in Stockholm on Wednesday.</p> <p>Palme, 59,&nbsp;was shot in the back, at close range, at 11.21 pm on 28 February 1986 as he was walking home from a cinema in central Stockholm with his wife Lisbet. The assailant disappeared into a side street, prompting a huge but abortive manhunt and an investigation that has gripped Sweden for three decades.</p> <p>Known to Swedish media as \u201cthe Skandia man\u201d because he was working late in the company\u2019s building near the crime scene on the night of the murder, Engstr\u00f6m was questioned several times by police at the time, but ruled out as a suspect.</p> <p>\u201cEngstr\u00f6m is deceased,\u201d Petersson said. \u201cTherefore I am not able to start proceedings or even interview him. That is why I decided to discontinue the investigation.\u201d He said, however, he was \u201csure\u201d of his conclusion.</p> <p>Palme\u2019s son, Marten, told Swedish Radio he believed prosecutors had made the right call. \u201cI think Engstr\u00f6m is guilty. Given the current situation, I think it is reasonable to close the investigation,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The killing, described by the Swedish prime minister, Stefan L\u00f6fven, as an \u201copen wound\u201d, has left a deep scar on a country that still prides itself on being peaceful and safe, prompting many to say Sweden \u201clost its innocence\u201d that day. L\u00f6fven said on Wednesday he hoped the decision \u201cwould allow this wound to heal\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/may/16/olof-palme-sweden-prime-minister-unsolved-murder-new-evidence\">Who killed the prime minister? The unsolved murder that still haunts Sweden</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A petty criminal was convicted of the murder in July 1989 but acquitted on appeal, clearing the field for a multitude of conspiracy theories involving shadowy forces ranging from the South African security services to rogue Swedish police with far-right sympathies, the Kurdish separatists of the PKK and the CIA.</p> <p>Hans Melander, the chief investigator, said that over the years the case had generated more than 22,000 leads and files occupying 250 metres of shelves. More than 10,000 people had been questioned since 1986, he said, and 134 had claimed responsibility for the murder.</p> <p>The murder weapon was never recovered despite police testing 788 revolvers over the years, Melander said, adding that the marks on the two 357 Magnum bullets found at the scene \u2013 one that killed Palme, and a second that injured his wife, who died in 2018 \u2013 were so faint \u201cwe can\u2019t even prove they were fired by the same gun\u201d.</p> <p>But with no possibility of any conclusive new forensic evidence, he said, a new team of investigators appointed in 2016 began an exhaustive review of the circumstantial evidence, including witness statements, and found \u201cone person stood out\u201d.</p> <p>Engstr\u00f6m, whose death in 2000 was reported as a possible suicide and who was 52 at the time of the murder, had a military background, experienced alcohol and money problems, and was a member of a shooting club, Petersson said. \u201cHe was also part of a circle that was very strongly critical of Olof Palme and his politics,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Several witnesses gave descriptions that matched Engstr\u00f6m, Petersson said, stating his rough height and noting variously that the fleeing killer was dressed in a long jacket or coat, wearing a cap and glasses, and carrying a small bag.</p> <p>Engstr\u00f6m, whose family repeatedly dismissed accusations he was the murderer, called police and media the day after the assassination, saying he was one of the first to arrive on the scene but had left before police arrived.</p> <p>He claimed he had spoken to Lisbet Palme and tried to resuscitate the victim, adding that he ran off in an effort to give police vital information that the prime minister\u2019s wife had given him about the assailant\u2019s appearance.</p> <p>Petersson said there were clear inconsistencies in the story. \u201cWhat was strange, when we went through the material, was that none of the other witnesses, including Lisbet Palme, identified him as being present at the crime scene,\u201d he said. Yet he \u201ctold investigators quite a bit about how he acted at the crime scene\u201d.</p> <p>Other evidence, including time stamps from Engstr\u00f6m\u2019s office, threw up further questions. One key witness, Yvonne Nieminen, told police a man she saw hurrying from the scene, who matched Engstr\u00f6m\u2019s description, seemed to be \u201ctrying to close his bag while still running, rather than stopping to do so\u201d.</p> <p>Petersson said Engstr\u00f6m subsequently \u201cchanged his story many times\u201d, but was inexplicably dismissed by police as a serious suspect as early as May 1987. \u201cHad the current investigating team been in place 34 years ago, I think he would have been detained,\u201d Petersson said.</p> <p>\u201cIn my view, there was sufficient evidence for him to be remanded in custody. That would have given us a reasonable chance to search his office and home, examine his clothing, maybe find the weapon. Unfortunately, we cannot now do that because he is deceased.\u201d</p> <p>The prosecutor said investigators believed Engstr\u00f6m acted alone, but could not rule out the possibility of a broader plot. He also said there was \u201cno clear information placing a weapon in Engstr\u00f6m\u2019s hands\u201d but he \u201cmust have had one that night.\u201d</p> <p>Palme, who&nbsp;was prime minister between 1969 and 1976 and again from 1982 until his death, was a controversial, sometimes divisive figure both at home and abroad.</p> <p>A Social Democrat and passionate orator, he was vocal in his opposition to the US war in Vietnam, publicly supported left-wing governments in Cuba and Nicaragua and was fiercely critical of the apartheid regime in South Africa.</p> <p>He is viewed by his supporters as one of the architects of Sweden\u2019s modern welfare state, but was often at loggerheads with big business and the military, and frequently spoke out against nuclear power.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 12 June 2020 to clarify the nature of the governments in Cuba and Nicaragua supported by Palme.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/spikelee\">Spike Lee</a> has shown up with an insurgent filmic uproar to match the uproar in the world. Da 5 Bloods is a paintball gun loaded with real bullets: a blast of satire and emotional agony about race and the American empire, the evergreen wound of Vietnam, African-American sacrifices on the field of battle, and the fact that black deaths matter.</p> <p>It\u2019s an outrageous action painting of a film, splattering moods, genres, ideas and archive clips all over the screen \u2013&nbsp;with many a Brechtian-vaudeville alienation. It feels sometimes like an old-style war movie such as The Dirty Dozen but maybe Godard\u2019s Le Petit Soldat, with playful riffs on Hollywood Vietnam standards and even John Huston\u2019s The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. The movie tricks you into thinking that it\u2019s going to be a gentle, bittersweet picture about middle-aged guys with giant guts and prostates sadly coming to terms with their past, and the importance of letting go \u2026 and then it detonates a shock of fear and greed, which itself is always verging on action-movie melodrama and farce. It\u2019s all so inventively bizarre that you could treat it simply as a black comedy, but in the final 15 minutes there is an amazing crescendo of emotion.</p> <p>The bloods of the title are Paul (Delroy Lindo), Otis (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/15/clarke-peters-my-family-values\">Clarke Peters</a>), Melvin (Isiah Whitlock Jr) and Eddie (Norm Lewis), four ageing Vietnam veterans who have returned to south-east Asia on what appears to be a luxury vacation trip down memory lane. All four are haunted by the memory of their squad leader Norman (Chadwick Boseman), who died in action before their eyes and whose memory they have romanticised.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5RDTPfsLAI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/D5RDTPfsLAI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Lee creates flashback combat sequences for the five men, but without Irishman-type youthification for the four survivors. They appear in the past the way they are now, as sweaty, out-of-condition and very scared old guys in the jungle, surreally led by the impossibly handsome young Boseman who has grown not old as those that are left grew old. He was and is their leader; Lee shows us that he now looks like their son. And this is especially powerful when they hear about Martin Luther King\u2019s assassination from the communist Radio Hanoi announcer (Van Veronica Ngo), and Norman angrily tells his men to ignore her recommendation to mutiny because they owe their racist commanders nothing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/03/delroy-lindo-george-floyd-protests-da-5-bloods-spike-lee-british-racism-america\">Delroy Lindo: 'British racism is as violent and virulent as America's'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet the four guys\u2019 reappearance in Vietnam now is even more complicated: they are convinced they can recover a secret cache of US gold bullion intended to pay South Vietnamese troops, which they found in a burnt-out plane and had to abandon. And Paul, a recent Trump convert in a Maga cap, finds nothing therapeutic in their journey into the past. He gets more and more disturbed.</p> <p>Lee has taken the battle-scarred old movie trope of Vietnam and found something relevant and intersectionally complex: black people, because they largely didn\u2019t have the contacts or resources to avoid the draft, or to finesse the avoidance of dangerous frontline duty, found themselves engaging the enemy and being a major though under-reported part of the Vietnam story. Paradoxically, it meant taking on oppressed people with whom they had no quarrel \u2013 that is, those people that Mohammed Ali famously said had never tainted him with the N-word \u2013 but also feeling ambiguous and conflicted about warfare, patriotism and America itself. They had fought, sacrificed and felt proud.</p> <p>All of these ideas and feelings swirl around in Da 5 Bloods, knockabout rhetoric mixed in with grandstanding sentimentality and action, right up to the old-school \u201ccurtain-call\u201d credits, like something from The Great Escape. There are some uproarious war-movie-type flourishes, including a graphic shot of what happens to a snake when you shoot at it hysterically with your M-16 assault rifle. Lee mixes up the tone and mood, and, with the knowing cinematic references and consciously contrived scenarios, it\u2019s possible to feel detached or amused or bemused. But all that paves the way for the final 10 minutes, in which Lee brings in an outpouring of sadness and grief and determination that is almost overwhelming. For all its craziness, Da 5 Bloods finds an operatic anguish and yearning.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 Da 5 Bloods is on Netflix from 12 June.</p>",
  "<p>The killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd by a white police officer</a> took place thousands of miles from the UK. But the 46-year-old\u2019s cry in Minnesota that he could not breathe has sparked widespread protest in Britain. In the past two weeks, there have been demonstrations across UK cities. The protesters, the vast majority of whom were under 25, chanted: \u201cNo justice, no peace, no racist police\u201d and \u201cthe UK is not innocent\u201d. The demonstrations were largely organised through word of mouth and social media rather than established anti-racism groups.</p> <p>Protesters carried handmade placards with the names of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/05/mark-duggan-shooting-report-challenged-by-human-rights-groups\">Mark Duggan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/01/sean-rigg-five-officers-cleared-of-misconduct-over-death-in-custody\">Sean Rigg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/22/julian-cole-police-officers-face-dismissal-over-incident-in-which-student-was-paralysed\">Julian Cole</a> and others killed or left disabled by British police. They chanted for the Windrush generation, the victims of the Grenfell tower fire, and decried the high <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/covid-19-death-rate-in-england-higher-among-bame-people\">Covid-19 death rate among members of the BAME</a> community. </p> <p>The Guardian asked the two women who organised the protest as well as other organisers and demonstrators what has driven them to this momentous time in the UK\u2019s history of race relations about the moment that made them want to protest. Black lives matter in the streets and in police custody \u2013 but also, they said, in schools, hospitals and workplaces. Six of the protesters in London explained why they were there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4abcf47e75eefb93c7e53721c6fe86338829af1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4abcf47e75eefb93c7e53721c6fe86338829af1/0_58_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"John, 24, mechanic\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>John, 24 </strong></h2> <h2>Car mechanic</h2> <p>I became politicised at a really young age, probably when I was four. I was leaving a shop and security stopped me and my mum. The woman pulled out a scanner and started scanning me from head to toe. My mum gave her an earful, but that\u2019s when I realised that I looked different, that I was a target. They automatically assumed that I\u2019d stolen something when I hadn\u2019t.</p> <p>It was an important point in my life. It\u2019s the same issue trying to get a job. Even with mechanic shops all around London, it\u2019s harder for black people to get picked for a job in some of these places. The mechanic would rather take the white boy and not give me a shot. Enough is enough. My children aren\u2019t going to go through similar racist experiences. If I\u2019ve got to be out here every single day, I will be. </p> <p>Police brutality is a strong issue here in the UK too. During the coronavirus pandemic, police started coming round my area and black boys like me were getting stopped. Their excuses are we look like we\u2019re trying to steal something. They are stopping me in front of the building I live in, putting me in cuffs, embarrassing me in front of everyone. You\u2019re putting your hands on my parts for what? Just to feel power that you can abuse? These things need to stop. There are so many young black people here, outside the American embassy, because we all feel it. </p> <p>There has never been a time when I\u2019ve felt I can call the police: they\u2019re more likely to suspect me than actually help.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36d22907cfa0bb3e60f0b1ad1eab2f1c12c5d3da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36d22907cfa0bb3e60f0b1ad1eab2f1c12c5d3da/0_1034_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Chioma Atuanya, 22\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Chioma Atuanya, 22</strong></h2> <h2>Former recruitment consultant</h2> <p>I realised there was institutional racism in the UK when I was 15. My dad lives in Nigeria and he said he knew someone who had died of Ebola. Everyone at school was making jokes, whereas I was worried for my father\u2019s safety. I told people that it wasn\u2019t cool and that they had to stop because what if I made a joke about cancer? </p> <p>Everyone started kicking off. Someone made a racist comment towards me and my mum got called into school. Not because of what they said, but because of what I said. They said I needed to stop talking about controversial subjects at school or I would be excluded. It was probably the first time I had a proper conversation about racism with my mum. I thought the teachers would be more understanding, but nothing happened.</p> <p>Since then, I realised it\u2019s a lot bigger than I first thought. George Floyd isn\u2019t the first man to die at the hands of racism, but there is such a hype right now, we need to jump on it. These are innocent people who are not sick and they are dying anyway. People are just taking lives here. </p> <p>The presence of social media has blown up the issue. There is a large black community online sharing everything, and it has brought it to everyone\u2019s attention. There is no shadow of a doubt what\u2019s happening and now everyone is wising up to previous things when excuses were made. Everyone is seeing it\u2019s all just smoke.</p> <h2><strong>Aima, 18</strong></h2> <h2>Student and co-organiser of the London Black Lives Matter group LDN BLM</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f0b9ffa430a12df92fc1572f9a05a38bb1b542f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f0b9ffa430a12df92fc1572f9a05a38bb1b542f/0_560_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Aima\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve grown up with so many videos of police brutality; videos from the US, UK and all over the world.

It\u2019s been 10 years of watching people die online that has driven me to being so angry and wanting my voice to be heard.</p> <p>When I moved to the UK from Nigeria in 2012, I saw so much that I have never seen before. Seeing and hearing my friends talk about stop and searches has really affected me. There was a lot of racism in school; other students calling me the N-word, calling me a monkey. I\u2019m here today because I stand in solidarity with all my US brothers and sisters. Enough is enough; black people cannot keep suffering.</p> <p>Racism doesn\u2019t just happen in the US; it also happens here and that\u2019s why we\u2019re fighting. We need to realise that so many people have been harassed and assaulted by the British police. I\u2019m tired because systematic racism within the police system has been going on for years. Just because it\u2019s not talked about much doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not happening. We want people to be educated and to hear us. That is the main thing \u2013 hear our voices. I think marching has made a huge difference because everyone is speaking about the issue.</p> <h2><strong>Natasha, 21</strong> </h2> <h2>Student, co-organiser of LDN BLM</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11d27b43b669ed9fa479b12b676273862c930ecd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11d27b43b669ed9fa479b12b676273862c930ecd/0_1120_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Natasha\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>George Floyd\u2019s death was the catalyst for everything.

We aren\u2019t all that dissimilar to America. It\u2019s ignorant to think there isn\u2019t racism in the UK. There is racism here, there is racism practically everywhere, even in Africa, where nearly everyone is black. You have to educate yourself; look around you and look online.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure there are plenty of places that can tell you just how racist the system is. For me, racism in the UK was people in school making fun of your accent, people in restaurants wondering why you\u2019re not speaking English, people telling me they can\u2019t pronounce my name and asking whether I\u2019d prefer to be called John or Jack. It\u2019s wondering why they can\u2019t spell my last name, yet they can easily pronounce names like Schwarzenegger.</p> <h2><strong>Ruth Ngombo, 24</strong></h2> <h2>Student nurse</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af8e1d4a749dadb9da7b574227632ee9e51efbb8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af8e1d4a749dadb9da7b574227632ee9e51efbb8/0_1120_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ruth Ngombo\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It started when I was in secondary school. I came in for my first day, feeling great. My mum did my hair in little bobbles and plaits. The head of year seven, who was a white woman, shouted at me within moments of me entering the school. She said that my hair was not acceptable. She told me to remove it all. I was 11. I went to the toilet and cried. I wondered what I was supposed to do. The teacher would rather I looked like a fool and had my hair out than how it was. I just didn\u2019t agree with that. </p> <p>From that moment, it kind of shifted everything else for me. White teachers would say things like, \u201cYou\u2019re acting a bit ghetto,\u201d and I would think how is this allowed? I\u2019m here today for black women. We hear about what happens to black men in cases of police brutality, but it\u2019s black women that we don\u2019t really hear that much about. And, unfortunately, with black women who have been killed due to racism, nothing really happens.</p> <p>I felt like I needed to say something because it could be me. It could be any black woman and nobody would know our names. Black men, it\u2019s also your job to help take care and protect our black women. We are the ones who are going to provide the future.</p>",
  "<p>French police are hunting the killer of a brown bear in the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es after the government said it would bring legal action against the culprit.</p> <p>\u00c9lisabeth Borne, the ecology minister, described the shooting of the animal, a protected species, as \u201cillegal and deeply regrettable\u201d.

France adopted a 10-year \u201cbear plan\u201d in 2018 to reintroduce more of the animals, but environmentalists claim the government suspended the measure after lobbying from farmers; last year, locals said bears killed 1,173 sheep and destroyed 36 bee hives.</p> <p>To encourage \u201ccoexistence\u201d between farmers and bears, the French government offers funding for training guard dogs, installing fences to protect herds and the hiring of extra shepherds to keep an eye on flocks. Farmers say the mountain terrain means the measures are ineffective because the sheep spread out over a wide area, making them difficult to follow and vulnerable to attack.

  "<p>The killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back, with protests around the world capturing the anger at the death of yet another black person at the hands of the police, as well as the racial inequalities it exposed. After seeing the traumatic footage of Floyd\u2019s final moments, many people are asking what they can do to bring about change. With racism so deeply rooted in our social order, there can be no quick fixes \u2013 but here are 20 steps you can take.</p> <h2>Organise&nbsp;</h2> <p>When&nbsp;the civil rights leader Kwame Ture (formerly Stokely Carmichael) visited Birmingham in 1983, his message was clear: \u201cIf you are not in an organisation, then you are against your people.\u201d In other words, racism can only be addressed collectively; we can\u2019t afford to stand on the sidelines making excuses.</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Join one of the many organisations campaigning to change the system or to improve the conditions faced by minorities. There are always reasons to be sceptical: the people in them; the funding; the time commitment. But rather than criticise, if you agree with the organisation\u2019s goals, get involved and make it work.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://uffcampaign.org/\">United Families &amp; Friends</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.4frontproject.org/\">4Front</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ubele.org/\">Ubele</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.blackunity.org.uk/\">Organisation of Black Unity</a>&nbsp;are some suggestions; there&nbsp;are <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/black-lives-matter-charity-donate-uk-stephen-lawrence-stop-hate-a9544786.html\">many more</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>2</strong> If you are not able to join an organisation, create one. Start small, with a reading group, a community library or a campaign about a local issue.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Organise globally. This is not an American or British problem. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/brazil-black-lives-police-teenager\">The police killing of 14-year-old&nbsp;Jo\u00e3o Pedro Matos Pinto&nbsp;in Brazil</a> is a reminder of the global stakes. If we want real change, we have to make international connections.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a7c696e33e88ab07a18ba9ad4eb789034be33e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a7c696e33e88ab07a18ba9ad4eb789034be33e4/0_162_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Friends and family mourn the death of Jo\u00e3o Pedro Matos Pinto\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Friends and family mourn the death of Jo\u00e3o Pedro Matos Pinto, who was killed by police in Sao Goncalo, Brazil in May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ant\u00f3nio Lacerda/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>4</strong> Design campaigns that disrupt. History teaches us that it is only when those in power have something to lose that change occurs. Strikes work because they cost your employer; boycotts because they deprive companies of revenue; and civil disobedience because it shuts down institutions. Urban rebellions were key in securing civil rights in the US in the 60s and the limited police reforms in the UK in the 80s. Clear demands coupled with disruptive campaigns converge the interests of those in power with the interests of the oppressed.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Support an organisation financially. Organising is not for everyone and certain struggles are black-led by design. But all groups need financial support. Remember that freedom is not free \u2013 if we want change, we have to put our money where our mouths are.</p> <h2>Make your vote count&nbsp;</h2> <p>Malcolm X warned that the \u201cfox\u201d who poses as your friend as he oppresses you is just as deadly&nbsp;as the \u201cwolf\u201d who is more open about his violent racism. Trump is wolf-in-chief in the White House, but watch out for those foxes.</p> <p><strong>6</strong> Think about who you vote for. Maya Angelou said: \u201cWhen someone shows you who they are, believe them.\u201d Look at the records of the party you want to vote for: how have they treated immigrants; what laws have they passed around equal rights and race relations?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3470aa3aaed002d9aabf753b62fc9903517584ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3470aa3aaed002d9aabf753b62fc9903517584ad/0_42_4500_2699/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A vigil in remembrance of black women and girls killed by US police, New York, 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It\u2019s not just about the men: a vigil in remembrance of black women and girls killed by US police, New York, 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Knox/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>7</strong> Write to your MP. You can write to your elected representative even if you did not vote for them. You could start by supporting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2020/may/16/pm-faces-calls-for-independent-inquiry-into-bame-covid-19-deaths\">an&nbsp;independent inquiry into minority deaths&nbsp;from Covid-19</a> or an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/stop-the-maangamizi-we-charge-genocide-ecocide\">all-party inquiry into reparations</a>. But feel free to write about any issue, whether action on police brutality, education equality or any other area of racial injustice.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Make work fairer</h2> <p>We have all seen businesses and institutions issue statements of horror at recent events. But expressing outrage is one thing; dealing with a lack of diversity or a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/07/bias-in-britain-what-can-employers-the-government-and-you-do-about-it\">bias in the workplace</a> is quite another. Employment is key to a fairer world, because lack of access to jobs and career progression compounds economic inequalities.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>8</strong> Call out unjust hiring practices. If you work in, or use the services of, an organisation that seems only to hire white people, say something. Next time you are in a team meeting and it is entirely white, remember that this is a problem you can be part of solving. Promotions are also important. The NHS, for example, has a diverse workforce, but, as a report on its <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/edc7-0514.pdf\">\u201csnowy white peaks\u201d</a>&nbsp;noted, representation declines the higher up the organisation you go.&nbsp;Universities are so white that there are no black vice-chancellors in the UK and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/feb/27/fewer-than-1-of-uk-university-professors-are-black-figures-show\">only 140 black professors out of 21,000</a>.</p> <p><strong>9</strong> Find out your workplace\u2019s policies for dealing with racial harassment. If you have no idea how to report racism in your workplace, you are not alone. People often feel intimidated about raising complaints and unsupported in doing so. You can challenge this by writing to companies and institutions to provide clarity or explain the lack of any such policies.</p> <p><strong>10</strong> Drop the term BAME. There are a multitude of&nbsp;experiences of racism, making the catch-all term black, Asian and minority ethnic unhelpful when dealing with racism. Instead try to understand how racism towards different minority groups is expressed and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/09/black-people-racism-anti-blackness-discrimination-minorities\">the distinctive features of anti-black racism</a> that are so central to understanding what is happening today. It is also true that anti-black racism is not perpetrated only by white people.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b67bd3a1dd678a1096d5911e027c2a21e49db04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b67bd3a1dd678a1096d5911e027c2a21e49db04/0_276_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chelsea Kwakye and Ore Ogunbiyi, authors of Taking Up Space: A Black Girl\u2019s Manifesto for Change\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chelsea Kwakye and Ore Ogunbiyi, authors of the book Taking Up Space: A Black Girl\u2019s Manifesto for Change.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Improve education</h2> <p>A society can only be as equal as the knowledge on which it is built, so rethinking education is essential.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>11</strong> Read. There is a wealth of knowledge produced by those who experience and understand racism. It may not be on the curriculum, but the books are out there. An abundance of voices from black Britain can help us to understand this moment, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/afuahirsch\">Afua Hirsch</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/akala\">Akala</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nelson-abbey\">Nels</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nelson-abbey\"> Abbey</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/15/chelsea-kwakye-and-ore-ogunbiyi-taking-up-space-merky-books-interview\">Chelsea Kwakye and Ore Ogunbiyi</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/06/jeff-sessions-white-rage-book-carol-anderson\">White Rage by Carol Anderson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/12/4/20953282/racism-housing-discrimination-keeanga-yamahtta-taylor\">Race for Profit</a> by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/keeanga-yamahtta-taylor\">Keeanga-Yahmatta Taylor</a> are hugely important to understanding the US. This is just the tip of the iceberg; dive into <a href=\"https://theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/02/top-10-books-about-black-radicalism\">an alternative&nbsp;radical vision of&nbsp;history</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>12</strong> Think intersectionally. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/30/sayhername-why-kimberle-crenshaw-is-fighting-for-forgotten-women\">Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw</a> coined the term as a way to truly understand how different parts of our identities can overlap and compound discrimination. For instance, the killing of George Floyd has sparked protests in a way that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/breonna-taylor-louisville-protest-george-floyd\">the death of Breonna Taylor</a> in March did not. We have gendered how we understand police killings, which is why the campaign to highlight police brutality and anti-black violence against women,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aapf.org/shn-campaign\">#SayHerName</a>, was so important. One of the reasons we focus on violence against men is that it is so public. Taylor was killed in her home; the oppression of women often happens in private.</p> <p><strong>13</strong> Write to your local school about its curriculum. If you are a parent, you have the responsibility and power to challenge your school on what it is teaching the children. Make sure black history goes beyond the token display in October.&nbsp;Support campaigns to transform the school curriculum, such as <a href=\"https://www.theblackcurriculum.com/action\">the Black Curriculum</a>.</p> <p><strong>14</strong> If you are a student, demand reforms at your university. Universities produce the knowledge dispensed in schools. It is student movements that have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jan/30/students-want-their-curriculums-decolonised-are-universities-listening\">pushed the sector into trying to \u201cdecolonise\u201d the curriculum</a>. As a consumer, you can demand a different curriculum and new hiring practices. Also, consider a course that challenges the Eurocentric curriculum: for example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bcu.ac.uk/courses/black-studies-ba-hons-2020-21\">black </a><a href=\"https://www.bcu.ac.uk/courses/black-studies-ba-hons-2020-21\">studies</a> at Birmingham City and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gold.ac.uk/pg/ma-black-british-history/\">black British </a><a href=\"https://www.gold.ac.uk/pg/ma-black-british-history/\">history</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gold.ac.uk/pg/ma-black-british-writing/\">black British writing</a> at Goldsmiths, University of London.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>15 </strong>Build alternatives. We do not have to accept the confines of the school system. In the UK, there is a 60-year history of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nabss.org.uk/\">black supplementary schools</a>, where people volunteered to teach what the schools would not. This point goes hand in hand with organisation and ensuring that, if we believe something is important, we do it regardless.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"386b8ceee081fb73bff233b83fc310fd442ca8c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/386b8ceee081fb73bff233b83fc310fd442ca8c5/129_894_4176_2506/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters in Louisville, Kentucky\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Question privilege: protesters in Louisville, Kentucky.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darron Cummings/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Personal</h2> <p>No individual can solve the deeply embedded issue of racism. But personal change must be part of beginning to address it, particularly because the daily paper cuts of casual racism are so painful for those who experience them.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>16</strong> Listen. If you know black people, they will likely have told you lot of times about their experiences \u2013 but did you really listen? We are not playing the race card, nor do we have chips on our shoulders. It should not take a video of a man being killed and thousands of people in the street for you to pay attention.</p> <p><strong>17</strong> Take responsibility for tackling racism where you see it. This could be in personal interactions, the workplace or on the bus. People tend to act in ways they can get away with. Calling out racist behaviour can make life more bearable for others.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>18</strong> It is better to stay out of it than to dip your toe in. Shallow, tokenistic commitment is worse than silence. If you are interested in racism only when it is trending, keep your solidarity to yourself.</p> <p><strong>19</strong> Check your privilege. Recognising white privilege has become a major focus in building a fairer society, but we also need to recognise the privilege of living in the west. We can watch the killing of George Floyd only because of smartphones, which are so cheap only because they are made using resources stolen from Africa. Racism can be deadly in the west, but it is a daily matter of life and death in developing world, where <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22935692\">a child dies every 10 seconds because of poverty</a>. We cannot limit our imagination to solving the problems of inclusion into a system that oppresses worldwide.</p> <p><strong>20</strong> Stay positive. We have been conditioned into believing that there is no alternative, that we have reached the end of history. That is white supremacist PR that cannot see beyond its own experience. It is time to radically rethink society to make it value black life. History tells us that the oppressed won\u2019t wait for ever. It is time to get on the bus or get out of the way.&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p>Before the coronavirus crisis, Britain already had a longstanding challenge on social mobility. Ours is a country where background and circumstance shape a person\u2019s life instead of talent, hard work and potential. For too long Britain has functioned on connections over competence.</p> <p>But coronavirus and its economic impact is now making that opportunity gap significantly wider. <a href=\"https://www.socialmobilitypledge.org/news-and-blog/study-reveals-areas-facing-double-hit-in-opportunities-after-covid-19?rq=Corby\">Research</a> by the Social Mobility Pledge has identified emerging opportunity gaps in communities across the country where people are being left behind. The analysis shows places such as Corby, Wellingborough and Norwich are all facing an economic double hit from existing poor social mobility made worse by the impact of the economic crisis of coronavirus.</p> <p>It\u2019s now urgent that ministers set out their strategy for \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/05/the-guardian-view-on-levelling-up-easy-to-say-hard-to-do\">levelling up</a>\u201d our country, in the government\u2019s own words, including helping these communities hit hardest by the economic impact of coronavirus.&nbsp;Boris Johnson\u2019s government risks presiding over a levelled-down Britain.</p> <p>The prime minister was right to make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/05/levelling-up-let-tories-off-hook-conservative-policies\">levelling up</a> a key objective for his government. Yet nearly a year after coming into office last July, ministers have still not set out a comprehensive strategy on how the government proposes to achieve it \u2013 even as it becomes more crucial. Levelling up must be a strategy that cuts across government and is the foundation stone that all other policy must sit on. Weak social mobility is a systemic problem for Britain, so every department will need to set out its own part of this strategy. Unless action is joined up across government, it will fail, and it needs the sort of ambition that has not been seen previously. Levelling up is about far more thana roads and rail programme and a pothole fund.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/05/the-guardian-view-on-levelling-up-easy-to-say-hard-to-do\">The Guardian view on levelling up: easy to say, hard to do | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the meantime, the risk of going backwards is obvious. There is a lack of any overarching longer-term plan beyond the summer to deal with the economic fallout of coronavirus \u2013 whether in education and careers for young people, or retraining for those who will lose their jobs.&nbsp;</p> <p>It\u2019s also clear that some communities facing the worst job losses will need more targeted action to support them over the coming months and years. Again, there is little sign of this from ministers.</p> <p>There are lessons to be learnt from other recessions too. In the 1980s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/07/britain-recessions-history\">recession</a>, my father lost his job in the steel industry but was offered retraining as a welder \u2013 even as welders were also being made redundant. Poor advice and poor retraining meant he was unemployed for over a year. We should not repeat those mistakes but, as things stand today, there is no plan of the breadth and scale that will be needed to help newly unemployed people transition into new green jobs such as those in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-capture-and-storage\">carbon capture and storage</a>.</p> <p>The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said he would do \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/17/rishi-sunak-pledges-350bn-to-tackle-coronavirus-impact\">whatever it takes</a>\u201d to help businesses and households get through the coronavirus health crisis. Now he must do whatever it takes to support these children, young people and communities to level up.</p> <p>Yet the reports of road building, VAT or stamp duty relief and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/nov/25/gdp-contracting-slower-than-thought-recession\">cash for clunkers</a>\u201d car schemes are just the same old Treasury proposals that were made to the incoming Treasury team I was part of in 2010. I know, I saw them come across my desk. A decade on, new ideas and solutions are needed. It\u2019s as if Treasury officials have just searched back in old files and then presented them to a new set of ministers.</p> <p>A budget initially mooted for mid-July has now been downgraded to some announcements on spending. If a full budget is now not planned until the autumn, that could be too late for millions of people affected by the economic fallout of coronavirus.&nbsp;</p> <p>Boris Johnson must bring some more immediate vision to where he takes our country as we emerge from the health crisis \u2013 now could be the moment for him to set out how we reskill Britain to deliver a green economy. It could be the opportunity for the government to support a wholesale shift on homeworking to allow unwanted office space to convert to the extra housing that many families and young people so badly need. Much smaller class sizes, with the right teaching and investment, could be the chance for our hard-pressed education system to finally fulfil its promise of being the great leveller for less advantaged children. But without decisive action and ambition, this moment will pass him by.</p> <p>The public don\u2019t want piecemeal initiatives and empty rhetoric from ministers. Instead they need clear-cut, long-term plans.</p> <p>Last summer, I urged Johnson\u2019s incoming government to set an emergency budget for social mobility and levelling up. I believed it was vital \u2013 but that opportunity was missed.&nbsp;Nearly a year later, as the weeks pass by, and with coronavirus still in our midst, for young people and left-behind communities, it\u2019s more important than ever.

When the world constantly displays a complete disregard for black men, this song year after year reminds them of how far they have come and empowers them to do more. As music journalist <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/j5xmz7/bashy-black-boys-british-positive-ten-years-on\">Aniefiok Ekpoudom writes</a>: \u201cFor someone like myself, who had a different accent and first language to my parents, but shared the same surname, Black Boys was an important moment in finding an identity of my own.\u201d</p> <h2>Dua Saleh \u2013&nbsp;Body Cast</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpYjTTbLzu8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QpYjTTbLzu8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Minneapolis native Dua Saleh gives a haunting and empowering take on police brutality in their sombre song Body Cast, released last week. It opens and closes with a woman fiercely defending her rights: \u201cThere is nothing going on here and you are violating my rights!\u201d she scolds as a baby calls in the background. The video sees Saleh walking through empty train tracks folding and rolling with their own words; images of burning buildings, speeding police cars and police with batons litter it, and add to the ominous and rebellious feel of the song.</p> <h2>Kendrick Lamar - Alright&nbsp;</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-48u_uWMHY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z-48u_uWMHY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>When the signature Pharrell-produced vocal harmonies start up this track, it is impossible to not feel goosebumps. This song will be a protest anthem for black movements until justice is served, and then it will be used for a celebration. When Lamar performed it at the 2016 Grammys, he shuffled on stage in a line of black men with chains around their ankles and delivered the most powerful performance of the evening. By that point it had already been used as a chant for students protesting police brutality on campuses, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eminemsrib/status/1270262803383934983?s=20\">today, at protests</a> around the world, it still flows through the streets and lights a fire in demonstrators. This song typifies both the reason why we are protesting and have the strength to carry on. \u201cAnd we hate po-po / Wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga / I\u2019m at the preacher\u2019s door / My knees gettin\u2019 weak and my gun might blow\u201d \u2013 a desperate series of images, until he lays a hand on our shoulders: \u201cBut we gon\u2019 be alright.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Like most big-idea books, this one begins by absurdly overstating the novelty of its argument. The author promises to reveal \u201ca radical idea\u201d that has been \u201cerased from the annals of world history\u201d. It is, even, \u201ca new view of humankind\u201d. Some measure of bathos is presumably intended when we learn that this radical new view is that \u201cmost people, deep down, are pretty decent\u201d. But there appears to be no authorial shame over the laughably bogus claim that this idea has been \u201cerased\u201d from history, presumably by a dark centuries-long conspiracy of secretive misanthropes, to some bafflingly obscure end.</p> <p>Not yet erased from the annals of history, for example, is the 18th-century philosopher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2014/jan/20/rousseau-compassionate-intense-relevant-philosopher\">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>, on whom the author regularly calls for his view that humans are naturally nice, and it is the institutions of civilisation that have corrupted us. Bregman contrasts this with what he calls, following the biologist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/frans-de-waal\">Frans </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/frans-de-waal\">de Waal</a>, \u201cveneer theory\u201d: the view (attributed to Hobbes among others) that civilisation is a thin skin of decency barely concealing the savage ape underneath.</p> <p>You might suspect that there is something to both these views simultaneously, but <em>Humankind</em> is a polemic in the high Gladwellian style and so aims to be a simple lesson overturning our allegedly preconceived ideas, with the help of carefully selected study citations and pseudo-novelistic scenes from the blitz and other teachable stories. The \u201cveneer\u201d theory, Bregman insists, is totally wrong.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"76347827b7dcb7821db1dca9bccc721b793499ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76347827b7dcb7821db1dca9bccc721b793499ce/1649_349_2202_2753/800.jpg\" alt=\"Rutger Bregman\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rutger Bregman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maartje ter Horst</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What is his evidence? Infants and toddlers, studies suggest, have an innate bias towards fairness and cooperation. When some Tongan children were shipwrecked on a Pacific island for over a year, they cooperated generously rather than re-enacting<em> Lord of the Flies</em>. In the first world war, German and British soldiers played football on Christmas Day. (Rather courageously, the author chooses this overfamiliar fable as his sentimental endpiece.)</p> <p>Such anecdotes are heartwarming, but perhaps you want more evolutionary meat. Why, for example, did early humans survive while our cousins the Neanderthals did not? Veneer theorists suspect grimly that we simply killed them all. \u201cThe more plausible theory,\u201d Bregman writes, \u201cis that we humans were better able to cope with the last ice age because we\u2019d developed the ability to work together.\u201d That sounds nice, but apparently the author has forgotten how, just a few pages earlier, he observed that Neanderthals \u201cbuilt fires and cooked food. They made clothing, musical instruments, jewellery and cave paintings\u201d. In other words, they worked together too. So his explanation makes little sense.</p> <p>Such inconsistencies bedevil the book, particularly in its argument (again following Rousseau) that the great tragedy of human history was the invention of agriculture and cities around 10,000 years ago. That brought the drudgery of work and the rise of political leaders and war. Until then we were all happy peacenik hunter-gatherers. \u201cAny time we crossed paths with a stranger,\u201d Bregman writes confidently of this prehistoric idyll, \u201cwe could stop to chat and that person was a stranger no more.\u201d But here, unless he owns a time machine, he is simply making things up. And cherry-picking his evidence again: at least one modern hunter-gatherer society, the !Kung people, were found to be very violent, particularly towards strangers. At length, Bregman\u2019s wilfully Edenic view of prehistoric society prompts the reader to wonder why, if he loves the hunter-gatherer lifestyle so much, he doesn\u2019t go and live there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"db98cdc25346956f4b0a66af511bfd69a8ee91d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db98cdc25346956f4b0a66af511bfd69a8ee91d7/328_0_2353_2352/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Signs of savagery \u2026 the 1963 film adaptation of Lord of the Flies.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Signs of savagery \u2026 the 1963 film adaptation of Lord of the Flies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since Bregman is a priori sure that all nasty stories about human nature must be \u201cmyths\u201d, he tries to puncture several. The chapter on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/09/philip-zimbardo-boys-are-a-mess\">Philip Zimbardo</a>\u2019s notorious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/oct/16/medicalscience.realitytv\">Stanford prison experiment</a> ably collects the recent discoveries that the whole thing was a hoax, with the guards being coached in their cruelty to the prisoners. On the other hand, a bizarre chapter about Easter Island attempts to disprove, on the basis of some inconclusive fragments of evidence, the accepted story of how deforestation led to civil war, cannibalism and population collapse. This never happened, concludes Bregman blithely, even though the Easter Islanders themselves say it did: a vivid example of his gift for dismissing inconvenient evidence.</p> <p>That approach, however, won\u2019t wash with Stanley Milgram\u2019s \u201cobedience\u201d experiments, in which subjects were instructed by experimenters to give (fake) electric shocks to people in another room, and continued to do so even when the \u201cvictims\u201d seemed to be in terrible pain. Disarmingly, Bregman admits that he originally wanted to bring this story crashing down, but he can\u2019t: the findings have been robustly repeated. Instead he reframes the subjects\u2019 \u201cobedience\u201d as \u201cconformity\u201d, which might sound to you like a distinction without much of a difference. Our social instinct to conform, along with the well-known camaraderie between soldiers, is what Bregman finally offers as an explanation for the Holocaust, in place of some story about fundamental human evil. Which even if plausible, notably fails to explain the actions of the Nazi leaders themselves.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Any claim that complex human beings are essentially wicked or lovely, one single thing or another, is a fairytale</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So far, so less radical than originally sold to the reader. But Bregman also wants to reshape human society in the light of his not-very-new news. This would involve, for example, widespread hyper-local participatory democracy, in which many more people go to endless town-hall meetings, though politics nerds who champion such arrangements might be overestimating the general public\u2019s appetite for political participation. (The grand bargain of modern liberal democracy is that citizens pay a professional political class so that, most of the time, they don\u2019t have to think about politics.) Bregman also points at how nice Norwegian prisons are, and visits a hippyish school where there are no set lessons or curriculum. If we believed in human decency, he suggests, this is how things could be everywhere.</p> <p>But plainly the attempt to replace a story about humans\u2019 essential wickedness with a contrasting story about humans\u2019 essential loveliness has already run aground \u2013 as it was bound to, since any claim that complex human beings are essentially one single thing or another is a fairytale. \u201cI\u2019ve argued that humans have evolved to be fundamentally sociable creatures,\u201d Bregman writes \u2013 as though this is a brave thing to argue, though absolutely no one in the world disagrees with it \u2013 \u201cbut sometimes our sociability is the problem.\u201d Well, sure. Gun-toting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/michigan-protests-coronavirus-lockdown-armed-capitol\">anti-lockdown protesters</a> in the US are being sociable; so are criminal gangs and far-right activists. On the other hand, because things are more complicated than such books allow, sometimes being <em>anti</em>-social is the problem.</p> <p>Bregman unwittingly provides a perfect illustration of this when he goes to meet the director of the hippy school. \u201cDrummen is one of those people who never lost his knack for play, and who has always had an aversion to rules and authority,\u201d Bregman writes admiringly. \u201cWhen he comes to pick me up from the railway station, he leaves his car parked flagrantly across the bike path.\u201d So this maverick pedagogical hero, who loves freedom from rules, is actually a dysfunctional egotist who unthinkingly restricts the freedom of others. Any cyclist who had to navigate around this buffoon\u2019s vehicle that day would have been just that little bit less inclined to agree that people are fundamentally good-hearted.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Humankind: A Hopeful History is published by Bloomsbury (RRP \u00a320).

  "<p><strong>What was the situation like when the league was suspended on 13 March? </strong>Frank Lampard had bristled when January passed without any arrivals at Stamford Bridge, warning that hopes of finishing in the top four were under threat. His concerns looked justified when his inconsistent side were beaten at home by Manchester United on 17 February. The most inexperienced manager in the league had seen frailties in attack and defence and although victory against Tottenham followed, Chelsea\u2019s shortage of quality was hammered home when Bayern ran riot in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/20/olivier-giroud-signs-contract-extension-to-stay-at-chelsea-next-season\">Olivier Giroud signs contract extension to stay at Chelsea next season</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet there were positive signs. Kepa Arrizabalaga regained his spot in goal, while Olivier Giroud and Pedro started to fire in attack after injuries led to them being brought in from the cold. Then there was the impact of Billy Gilmour, who got his chance because of a selection crisis in midfield. The 18-year-old made a stunning impact in the victory against Liverpool in the FA Cup and his poise on the ball stood out when Chelsea, showing rare conviction in attack, tightened their grip on fourth place with a 4-0 thrashing of Everton on 8 March.</p> <p><strong>What about now? </strong>The break stalled Chelsea\u2019s momentum but it has allowed injured players to return. Mateo Kovacic has shaken off a minor knock, Christian Pulisic is back from the adductor problem that has kept him out since 1 January and Ruben Loftus-Cheek will hopefully be ready to compete after recovering from an achilles injury. However it remains to be seen if N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 will be available after expressing health fears about coronavirus. Giroud and Willy Caballero have signed one-year contract extensions but Willian and Pedro could yet leave on free transfers on 30 June. Lampard will not want to lose them before the campaign is over \u2013 after all Chelsea will not have the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/05/timo-werner-transfer-u-turn-chelsea-liverpool-rb-leipzig\">RB Leipzig forward Timo Werner</a> at their disposal until next season.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Recap\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p><br><strong>What needs to be done to have a successful end to the season? </strong>With Werner close to joining for \u00a353m, Hakim Ziyech due to arrive from Ajax and Lampard keen to sign Leicester\u2019s Ben Chilwell, Chelsea cannot afford to miss out on Champions League qualification. The job is far from done, with Lampard\u2019s side three points above fifth-placed Manchester United and five clear of Wolves and Sheffield United. Chelsea have often struggled to kill off teams, especially at home, and have shipped too many soft goals. They need to be more calm, more focused in defence and have greater precision in attack. For Lampard, the challenge is demonstrating he has used the time off to devise a more coherent tactical plan. Chelsea, who are also in the FA Cup quarter-finals, have let too many games spiral out of control.</p> <p><strong>Have players and staff behaved during lockdown? </strong>Callum Hudson-Odoi was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/18/chelsea-callum-hudson-odoi-arrested-after-police-called-to-his-home-reports\">reportedly arrested on the morning of 18 May</a> and later released and bailed until mid-June. Mason Mount had to be reminded of his responsibilities after the midfielder was pictured having a kickabout with West Ham\u2019s Declan Rice on 15 March.</p> <p><strong>Any unsung/community heroes? </strong>Chelsea&nbsp;have played an active role in the community since the coronavirus outbreak. They&nbsp;opened up the Millennium Hotel&nbsp;on their Stamford Bridge stadium site to NHS staff &nbsp;and teamed up with the domestic abuse charity Refuge to help provide support for people forced to self-isolate in vulnerable situations. The players also donated money to enable the Chelsea Foundation to help those in need during the crisis.</p> <p><strong>Key player in the run-in? </strong>Lampard will hope the deal for Werner will fire up Tammy Abraham, Chelsea\u2019s top scorer. Abraham, who has struggled with an ankle injury this year, can link play and is smart inside the box. Chelsea need him to settle tight games.</p> <p><strong>End-of-season prediction </strong>Chelsea should have enough to qualify for the Champions League, especially if Manchester City\u2019s ban means fifth place is enough, while their knockout prowess makes them a threat in the FA Cup. However they are unlikely to pull off a dramatic comeback when they play the second leg against Bayern in the Champions League.</p> <p><strong>Remaining fixtures (all times BST):&nbsp;Sun 21 June

  "<p>As traumatised&nbsp;US&nbsp;farmers continue to cull their animals in response to the slaughterhouse crisis, an Iowan&nbsp;pig producer&nbsp;has developed an on-farm method which he believes is quicker and more humane than other available options.</p> <p>The coronavirus crisis has hit US meat plants particularly hard. As a result there is a lack of slaughter capacity, and farmers are being forced to cull or \u201cdepopulate\u201d their animals on-farm.&nbsp;</p> <p>Approved methods include gassing with CO2, but the practice is controversial. \u201cDying this&nbsp;way is not a peaceful experience\u201d, even under normal circumstances, let alone in&nbsp;makeshift sheds or trailers, said&nbsp;president of welfare group,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mercyforanimals.org/\">Mercy for Animals</a>,&nbsp;Leah Garc\u00e9s.</p> <p>Gassing the animals is currently thought to be one of the fastest and most humane methods,&nbsp;leaving&nbsp;animals unconscious within two minutes and dead within 10. The carcasses are incinerated, composted or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nara.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rendering_ingredients_pigs.pdf\">rendered</a>&nbsp;for fat, fertiliser and pet food.</p> <p>But for Dwight Mogler of Iowa\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pighillfarms.com/about\">Pig Hill Farms</a>,&nbsp;that is too long.&nbsp;Mogler is a sixth-generation pig farmer with firsthand experience of gassing newborn pigs. \u201cI have talked to people who have been on site for a CO2 depopulation and we have used it for neonatal [new-born] pigs.&nbsp;It can take up to a minute,\u201d&nbsp;he said.</p> <p>Mogler, who produces about 150,000 pigs a year, says he is fairly confident the gassing is not painful for&nbsp;newborns, but it is disturbing. \u201cThere are muscle spasms and the limbs flail, but no vocalising,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Another depopulation option is overheating, or hyperthermia, commonly known as ventilator shutdown (VSD). A recent undercover video of an alleged VSD pig cull at a different Iowa producer contained disturbing scenes and sounds.</p> <p>Asked about the video,&nbsp;Mogler said it would have involved turning off the ventilation, turning up the temperature and then the introduction of steam. \u201cIt would take less than one hour and any remaining pigs would be shot with bolt guns. It might only take 10 minutes in fact for the pigs to die. But for us that is too long.\u201d</p> <p>Having rejected CO2 and&nbsp;VSD,&nbsp;Mogler decided to build his own cull&nbsp;facility. It&nbsp;will replicate a slaughterhouse death time of less than two seconds.&nbsp;Ready to undergo testing,&nbsp;Mogler\u2019s system consists of a mobile unit with a V-restrainer, an electrical stunning point and a captive-bolt gun. </p> <p>Mogler aims to slaughter about 170 pigs every 45 minutes, using a rotating slaughter crew to avoid mental or physical fatigue. \u201cOur capacity would be about 1,500 to 2,000 pigs a day,\u201d he said, and no pig caretakers will be involved in the slaughter.</p> <p>As well as developing his own cull technique, Mogler donated two pigs to a Missouri&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.farmaste.org/\">sanctuary</a>.&nbsp;Initially reluctant, because the goals of a sanctuary are so at odds with those of a farmer, Mogler changed his mind after talking to a rescue coordinator.&nbsp;\u201c I found we had so much more in common [than expected]\u201d, he said.</p> <p>Donating pigs to food programmes is another option for farmers, particularly with so many Americans facing increased financial and food insecurity, but slaughtering remains&nbsp;a challenge. For a few there is still space at local lockers, as Iowa\u2019s smaller, state-inspected butchers are known. Most, however, are already overwhelmed,&nbsp;with some fully booked into 2021.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/28/animal-feedlots-are-a-likely-threat-to-drinking-water-in-minnesota-says-report\">Animal feedlots are a likely threat to drinking water in Minnesota, says report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite donation difficulties, psychologist and Iowan farmer Dr Michael Rosmann thinks it\u2019s worth the effort. \u201cIt helps the farmers a bit, to know they have tried to find a solution for at least some of their pigs,\u201d Rosmann said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably only going to help with about 1% of their animals.&nbsp;These are farmers with anywhere from 3,000 to 10,000 pigs.&nbsp;It\u2019s a very complex situation and it is not going to end soon.\u201d</p> <p>Farmers are extremely distressed by the possibility of having to depopulate their animals, said Rosmann, who has talked to several in the past few weeks. \u201cOne of them was in tears. He could not bring himself to kill his pigs and he was asking for advice,\u201d Rosmann said. \u201cMy suggestion was to find food programmes or local butchers, or people who are able to butcher the animals themselves \u2013&nbsp;that\u2019s allowed by law, if you kill it and eat it yourself.\u201d Sadly, he said, many of those able to slaughter their own animals might be illegal migrants and afraid to come forward.</p> <p>At industry level, <a href=\"https://www.iowapork.org/producer-resources/resources-and-information/covid-19/\">Iowa&nbsp;Pork Producers Association</a> spokesperson, Dal Grooms, said its newly&nbsp;created food-bank donation programme, Pass the Pork, has seen 48,404lb of pork, about 456 pigs, enter the food chain via local lockers.&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p>China has been accused by Brussels of running disinformation campaigns inside the European Union, as the bloc set out a plan to tackle a \u201chuge wave\u201d of false facts about the coronavirus pandemic.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The European commission said Russia and China were running \u201ctargeted influence operations and disinformation campaigns in the EU, its neighbourhood, and globally\u201d. While the charge against Russia has been levelled on many occasions, this is the first time the EU executive has publicly named China as a source of disinformation.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>French politicians were furious when a Chinese embassy website claimed in mid-April, at the height of Europe\u2019s pandemic, that care workers had abandoned their jobs leaving residents to die. The unnamed Chinese diplomat also claimed falsely that 80 French lawmakers had used a racist slur against the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.</p> \n<p>\u201cI believe if we have evidence we should not shy away from naming and shaming,\u201d V\u0115ra Jourov\u00e1, a European commission vice-president, told reporters.&nbsp;\u201cWhat we also witnessed is a surge in narratives undermining our democracies and in effect our response to the crisis, for example the claim there are secret US biological laboratories on former Soviet republics has been spread by both pro-Kremlin outlets, as well as Chinese officials and state media.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cI strongly believe that a geopolitically strong EU can only materialise if we are assertive,\u201d Jourov\u00e1 said, alluding to the aim of the European commission\u2019s president, Ursula von der Leyen, for the body to have more clout on the world stage.</p> \n<p>The more assertive stance marks a change in tone from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/russian-media-spreading-covid-19-disinformation\">a </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/russian-media-spreading-covid-19-disinformation\">report in March</a> which merely described Chinese media narratives, while focusing the spotlight on disinformation from Kremlin-backed sources. It comes after lawmakers in the European parliament <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/eu-watered-down-report-on-chinese-disinformation-about-covid-19\">accused the commission of watering down an earlier report on disinformation under pressure from China </a>\u2013 charges EU officials <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/eu-foreign-policy-chief-denies-changes-to-report-on-china-coronavirus-disinformation\">strongly denied</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/deaths-comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>EU member states are grappling with how to deal with China on a range of fronts, from foreign policy and security, to the economy. The commission described China as <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/communication-eu-china-a-strategic-outlook.pdf\">a \u201csystemic rival\u201d in a 2019 report</a> that was seen by many member states as marking a watershed in how the EU deals with an increasingly aggressive government in Beijing.</p> \n<p>The EU commission also issued an implicit rebuke to Donald Trump, as it noted the harmful effects of his bizarre suggestions about injecting bleach to treat coronavirus. Without naming the US president, a commission document stated that such false claims can be \u201cvery harmful\u201d, noting that Belgium\u2019s Poison Control Centre has recorded an increase of 15% in the number of bleach-related incidents.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Jourov\u00e1 repeated her praise of Twitter for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/donald-trump-twitter-love-hate-relationship\">putting a factchecking tag&nbsp;on two of Trump\u2019s recent tweets</a>, while saying she would like to see a similar approach taken by social media companies on other false information.&nbsp;\u201cBe it the president, be the diplomats, be it me\u2026. when we [politicians] say something we have to be accountable and we should be able to stand that somebody goes and checks the facts.\u201d</p> \n<p>The commission has encouraged social media companies to sign a voluntary code of practice on disinformation, while threatening regulation if they fail to act. The latest report steps up demands on platforms to be more transparent in sharing data with researchers and intensify work with independent fact checkers.&nbsp;\u201cI would not like the platforms themselves to be the arbiters of truth,\u201d Jourov\u00e1 said.</p> \n<p>The Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok has become the latest company to sign the code of practice, the commission said, joining the likes of Facebook, Google, Twitter and Mozilla.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s Scottish golf courses are expected to get a tax rebate of nearly \u00a31m as part of a government bailout for tourism businesses hit by the coronavirus crisis, the Guardian can reveal.</p> <p>The Trump Organization\u2019s golf resorts in Aberdeenshire and Turnberry will benefit from emergency funding from the Scottish government worth \u00a32.3bn, which includes waiving the property taxes paid by hospitality, leisure and retail businesses this year.</p> <p>Before the coronavirus crisis, Trump Turnberry had been due to pay \u00a3850,766 in property tax this year and Trump Aberdeenshire \u00a3121,170. The&nbsp;Trump Turnberry\u2019s&nbsp;tax bill was recently reduced to \u00a3770,845, upon appeal.</p> <p>This week South Ayrshire, the local council which includes Turnberry, and Aberdeenshire council are expected to tell both businesses they no longer have to pay any of that tax, known as business rates, because they qualify for 100% relief.</p> <p>Both resorts have been able to avoid paying corporation tax, the main business tax in the UK, because they consistently report heavy losses due to their debts to Trump himself, cumulatively put at \u00a3155m in 2018.</p> <p>The revelation comes as some Democrats in the US Congress raise questions about whether it is lawful for Trump\u2019s companies to accept any benefits from a foreign country, including bailout funds from the UK and Scottish governments.&nbsp;</p> <p>The House oversight committee asked the Trump Organization to supply it with all documents related to the company\u2019s applications for loans or other funds by 21 May. There is no evidence that the company has complied with the request.</p> <p>One ethics expert in Washington stopped short of saying the property tax benefit represented an illegal gift under the emoluments clause of the US constitution \u2013 which was designed to block federal officials from receiving foreign payments \u2013 but said the tax rebate was nevertheless problematic.</p> <p>The US Congress has passed legislation prohibiting US taxpayer funds from being used to benefit companies in which&nbsp;Trump&nbsp;holds a stake.</p> <p>\u201cIt is troubling that he is getting essentially a benefit from the Scottish government, regardless whether it is an emolument. You shouldn\u2019t have a president who is in this kind of position who can say: \u2018I like what the UK did and I benefitted,\u2019\u201d said Noah Bookbinder, the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Scotland, the Aberdeenshire councillor Martin Ford said he did not object to Trump\u2019s businesses using a furlough scheme that allowed staff to continue to be paid, but criticised the business rates relief. \u201cTaxpayer assistance for a business owned by someone who boasts he is a multi-billionaire is quite another matter,\u201d Ford said.</p> <p>\u201cUnlike many people, Mr Trump won\u2019t be suffering any financial hardship. He doesn\u2019t need help. Mr Trump was given every assistance to set up in Scotland and the Scottish government repeated his ridiculous claims of an enormous economic and jobs boost for the region. Now, after years of losses, Mr Trump\u2019s Aberdeenshire business is actually getting taxpayer support, perhaps a final irony in a very sorry saga.\u201d</p> <p>The ownership of the Trump Organization was shifted to a trust when Trump became president, but the businessman and former reality TV star has remained the majority owner of the trust and is expected to retain his position in the company once his term in the White House ends.&nbsp;\u201cA benefit to the Trump Organization is in large part a benefit to Donald Trump,\u201d Bookbinder said.</p> <p>The Scottish and UK governments\u2019 emergency funds include funding the furlough of any staff not able to work because their businesses have closed down and a \u00a3120m emergency fund for \u201cpivotal enterprises\u201d. Trump Turnberry said in 2018 it employed about 477 people a month; the Aberdeenshire course said it employed 77 employees on average across that year.</p> <p>The pivotal enterprise resilience fund gives out tailored grants to firms seen as \u201cvital to the local or national economic foundations of Scotland\u201d, but companies have to pursue that funding and prove why they need it.</p> <p>A Trump Organization executive in Scotland, Sarah Malone, confirmed they had used coronavirus emergency funding schemes but refused to provide details on how much they had claimed or how many staff they had furloughed. Malone did not deny, however, that the two golf resorts were due to receive the property tax relief.</p> <p>\u201cIt is well known across the world that the tourism and hospitality industry has been dramatically affected by Covid-19. Almost all businesses within this sector have been unable to trade,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cOur priority throughout the mandatory closures has been the welfare of our staff and their families. The government schemes are designed to protect jobs and businesses affected by this worldwide crisis and to provide financial support to individuals unable to work. Most businesses across the UK, including those which have been able to continue to trade, have accessed the aid provided by the government.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Trump Aberdeenshire announced on 24 March it had delayed reopening for the 2020 season because of the UK-wide coronavirus lockdown.

And it\u2019s and there\u2019s a continuing pattern.</p> <p>There\u2019s a systemic pattern here which I appeal to the government, and this new system that the ministers believe is going to find the answers to it, this federation reform council, that this group of people actually look at the systemic approaches that take place where First Nations people are likely to come to the attention of police.</p> <p>We know that First Nations people who come to the attention of the police are likely to be arrested and charged. </p> <p>We know that First Nations people who come to the attention of the police will be charged but will also be sent to court. And when they go to court, what happens, they\u2019ll be sent to jail. Now this is a pattern. This is a paradigm, that systematic, it\u2019s systemic, it\u2019s institutionalised. </p> <p>And if you look at this, from a First Nations point of view, this is about the subjugation of the First Nations people. </p> <p>This is not about enlightened policy. This is about subjugating the First Nations people, you correlate that to the number of people who are being taken away, the number of kids, there will be 30,000 kids in their home care. </p> <p>And you\u2019ll come up with a \u2018it\u2019s going to take time. It\u2019s complicated. And you know, it\u2019s really difficult.\u2019</p> <p>Well, it\u2019s not. Address the underlying issues \u2013 health, housing, education, employment \u2013 and work with First Nations peoples through the Coag system, or through the new system of the reform council, whatever it is, to actually set some targets as senator Wong has said, around the scenes for incarceration rates, and for the diminishment of removing kids from custody, or being removed from their homes and put into custody of another family, which ultimately will lead to the adoption out of these kids. </p> <p>And I\u2019ll remind the government that the Bring Them Home report re-analyse the policies and practices that pertain to that, practices as heinous practices, bordered on genocide, bordered on genocide. </p> <p>So I agree, I asked you sincerely to make this a priority, a top priority for too long \u2013 nice words, good intentions, but the lack of action and commitment has not seen a reduction of deaths in custody. </p> <p>It\u2019s seen an escalation in the social indicators that diminish First Nations people and diminish us as a nation because we are incapable of dealing with it. </p> <p>So I ask the government to sincerely put the best intentions into its commitments, and enter in a real working commitment with the First Nations peoples, and get real agreements with the states, and stop pussyfooting around with the states, say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s the state\u2019s responsibility\u2019. </p> <p>Well, we know this.

As I said before, racism has no place in Australia, and we condemn it and call it out wherever we can.</p> <p>And the type of division that we\u2019ve seen in the US has been distressing and the fact that you have circumstances where black communities feel that they cannot live in an environment of safety \u2013 the fact that equally you now have circumstances where police, most of whom in the United States would still be good, law-abiding citizens, feel that they are being vilified, is creating a terrible circumstance there and I hope the US can find a way to come together and more successfully address these issues, and I don\u2019t want to see that sort of division brought at all into the Australian political debate.</p> <p>... Well, look, as I say, I\u2019m not surprised, but I am saddened and disappointed. I wouldn\u2019t engage in that type of vilification. His record can speak for itself, but equally, more importantly now, as we look to the future, the acts surrounding his death, I think, speak to an injustice that needs to be addressed in terms of that incident by the US legal system, but more broadly, an injustice that, as we\u2019ve seen, tragically in the US, the rates of deaths around Covid-19 have been disproportionately borne in communities \u2013 often black American communities. </p> <p>Thankfully in Australia, we have a much fairer system, a universal healthcare system, we are able to tackle many of these issues \u2013 not to the point of perfection. The job is never done in terms of stamping out racism, or driving towards creating the best environment for equality and opportunity for individuals. </p> <p>We have to be ever-vigilant and keep working there. But I think we have been saying that our system, in all of those areas, holds up amongst the best in the world, and much better than some of the challenging circumstances we\u2019ve seen in the US.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-10T06:49:47.451Z\">at 7.49am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ee07ea38f08beee219d88db\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/daniel-hurst\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-10T06:33:32.208Z\">7.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Australian year 12 students will receive their final results in the second half of December.</p> <p>A meeting of education ministers from across the country has decided the release of individual Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (Atar) results, for students completing year 12 in 2020, would occur \u201cwithin a nationally consistent window of 15 December to 31 December 2020\u201d.</p> <p>In a statement issued this afternoon, the group \u2013 known as the Education Council \u2013 said it recognised the challenges being year 12 students and their families were experiencing as the pandemic had disrupted their final year of schooling.</p> <p>It also \u201cacknowledged the seriousness of these concerns and agreed that year 12 students and their families must be supported and have reliable information to pursue their post-school pathways\u201d.</p> <p>A working group \u2013 which includes Universities Australia, the Australasian Curriculum, Assessment and Certification Authorities, and the Australasian Conference of Tertiary Admissions Centres \u2013 had advised students who wish to enter university in 2021 to \u201cwork hard and complete the Senior Secondary Certificate of Education\u201d.</p> <p>The Education Council also decided on a nationally consistent set of messages for all year 12 students to avoid any misunderstandings or confusion about the admissions processes for 2021. </p> <p>These key messages include:</p> <ul> <li>Current year 12 students will be able to complete a Senior Secondary Certificate of Education (SSCE) this year.

The member for Rankin in phrasing that question in that way has demonstrated, I think, a great deal of immaturity.</p> <p>The introduction of the jobkeeper program, the single largest form of social support this country has ever seen, in the most uncertain economic environment anyone could possibly imagine of our generation ... and Mr Speaker ... and rolled out in considerably rapid time and as we have achieved a level of economic outcome well in advance of what we had expected to achieve by this time. </p> <p>And having announced the fact that we would look carefully at the implementation when we announced the jobkeeper program before announcing any revisions that might be necessary, Mr Speaker. These are not things that can be done, Mr Speaker, in a rushed or ill-considered manner.</p> <p>The review is being undertaken in June. The review will make recommendations, I would imagine, to the government, as would be its purpose, and then the government would consider those recommendations. It would consider the fiscal implications of those recommendations and, Mr Speaker, it would take advice on that as cabinet\u2019s work. </p> <p>Now, I appreciate the member who asked the question has never served in a cabinet, Mr Speaker, let alone an expenditure review committee or had any sort of ministerial responsibility for working through such decisions of great importance.</p> <p>But he might be educated on this point. That when you make decisions of this gravity and this seriousness, Mr Speaker, in a situation like this, you are very careful about it.</p> <p>So as the government announced, we will make the decisions on the basis of the view that\u2019s been submitted by Treasury and that will be done in the third week or thereabouts of July, as is our anticipated timeframe, to provide that further economic statement that will take into account the review that is being done of the jobkeeper program. </p> <p>Now, that is the proper, responsible way to manage important financial decisions.

As a kid struggling with my burgeoning queerness I grabbed on to Madonna as a drowning person would a rubber ring. Here was one of the biggest stars in the world speaking about, and directly to, a queer audience. It was an alternative education of sorts (<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102370/\">Truth or Dare</a> was the first time I ever saw men kissing) and it wouldn\u2019t be hyperbole to say it saved my life. Like a Prayer pushed all the right buttons, with its blasphemous blend of the sacred and sex. Years later, in a Catholic secondary school, I handed in an essay about how the song and the furore around it (it saw Madonna\u2019s music banned from my school entirely) helped me work through feelings of guilt and confusion around my sexuality and my religion. The teacher who read it asked if I was sure I hadn\u2019t been \u201cbrainwashed\u201d. I was sure. It is also, of course, an absolutely incredible pop song and despite having heard it thousands of times now, it still gets my heart pumping. I have so many moments of joy associated with it and it still inspires mass singalongs in the east London bars I frequent these days. <strong>Philip Matusavage</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Oo8QzDHimQ\">Alice Cooper</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Oo8QzDHimQ\">: School\u2019s Out</a></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Oo8QzDHimQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2Oo8QzDHimQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In the summer of 1972 I was almost 14, seething with hormones and unfocused rebelliousness. Music was very important to me, and I adored the glam rock scene with all its outrageousness, its glitter and its tat. I was a huge fan of Marc Bolan and waited hungrily for the follow-up album to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/apr/10/marc-bolan-t-rex-interview\">Electric Warrior</a>. But when it came, as with many eagerly awaited events, The Slider was a huge disappointment and I was young enough to believe it was the end of the world. Suffering the deep disillusionment that only a 14-year-old can feel, I sought another hero. And suddenly there he was, on Top of the Pops \u2013 a tall, skinny guy with ratty black hair, a black leotard open to the navel, a sword and a lot of black makeup. Sometimes, in the grip of some intense of emotion, it\u2019s impossible to articulate the feeling even to ourselves. Sometimes, one can chance upon a song or a poem that expresses how we feel so powerfully it becomes the personification of that emotion x 100. That\u2019s what School\u2019s Out was to me, with its barrage of drums and dirty guitar riffs and the rasping vocals of Alice himself: an embodiment of joy, anger and rebellion. \u201cWe got no class / And we got no principles / We can\u2019t even think of a word that rhymes \u2026\u201d 1972 was a long time ago; so was that girl who was mesmerised by Alice. But at various angst-filled times in my life, I\u2019ve belted out School\u2019s Out in order to vent my feelings. And I still get a glimmer of that 14-year-old. <strong>Anon</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxtfdH3-TQ4\">Desmond Dekker and the Aces</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxtfdH3-TQ4\">: Israelites</a></h2> <p>Sometimes there would be a potential situation at teenage parties when both hippies and skinheads turned up.

The standout solo artist from this period was, of course, Cliff Richard; the standout instrumental band was certainly the Shadows (and not the Tornados); and the standout act was beyond all doubt Cliff Richard and the Shadows, working in collaboration and performing together. Cliff Richard and the Shadows were featured in the films Expresso Bongo and The Young Ones, which are hugely important defining film statements about the emerging of the new pop culture that would explode with creativity during the height of the 1960s. They were followed by Summer Holiday, a film musical that is full of wonderful songs and dance routines, and that gives expression to the spirit of the innocent last days of an era that would come to an end with the establishing of the Beatles hegemony at the end of 1963. Those are days that I find myself recalling more and more as the years pass; and it is good for me to do honour to an iconic UK No 1 hit single that celebrates summer, and the sunny exuberance of youth, now that I have entered the autumn of my life! <strong>Thinkandleap1234</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLZtqLrzbfs\">Culture Club</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLZtqLrzbfs\">: Do You Really Want to Hurt Me</a></h2> <p>A torch song in reggae style?

There\u2019s a desperation in her voice, a willingness to accept any compromise to get the relationship back. But there\u2019s also a strength there, that makes you feel her despair will burn itself out and she\u2019ll get through this, and come out the other side better than ever. In any other singer\u2019s hands, the repeated \u201cbelieve me\u201d at the end would sound pathetic, but somehow Dusty makes them sound positive. She might be begging for the past to return on the surface, but underneath she\u2019s facing the future with her head held high. <strong>David Absalom</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWA997xM9MI\">Lonnie Donegan</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWA997xM9MI\">: Cumberland Gap</a></h2> <p>I\u2019m a child in the 1980s and we\u2019re on a long car journey to visit my grandparents. The music, chosen by my parents, is heavily biased to the 50s and 60s, Buddy Holly and the Beatles and Johnny Cash (who I really believed had <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDktBZzQIiU\">shot a man in Reno</a>) interspersed with Tom Lehrer, Flanders and Swann and socialist Geordie folk satirist Alex Glasgow. Quite a mix. But best of all, we\u2019d listen to Lonnie Donegan. Lonnie was my dad\u2019s musical hero, and he talked about hearing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI4nRD-DRpk\">Rock Island Line</a> on the radio for the first time as a true life-changing experience, the first time pop music spoke directly to him and his generation. That particular track didn\u2019t make No 1, but Lonnie did hit the top spot for the first time with Cumberland Gap. It\u2019s simple, stripped-down music, with a propulsive rhythm and a performance of total conviction. And yet, of course, like all great pop music it\u2019s totally fake \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/nov/05/guardianobituaries.arts\">Lonnie</a> adopted the name in homage to the great Lonnie Johnson and sang songs of the American south despite coming from east London via Glasgow. He was a serious professional jazz musician, playing with Chris Barber, but inspired tens of thousands of kids to grab a battered guitar and a washboard and form a skiffle combo. It\u2019s the punk DIY aesthetic 25 years earlier, showing that anyone can form a band and make some noise with a guitar. Some of these skiffle bands were awful, a few were brilliant, and many musicians who came to prominence later on first learned to play in such a combo. Cumberland Gap remains an astonishing two minutes of fast and exciting pop music, but also has a place in history as skiffle morphed into the later British rock\u2019n\u2019roll. <strong>Nicholas Jones</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAXnqjUfal4\">Blur</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAXnqjUfal4\">: Beetlebum</a></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAXnqjUfal4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WAXnqjUfal4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Although it\u2019s mostly ridiculed now, at the time Britpop meant a lot to a huge number of teenagers looking to find their identity in the post-Thatcher landscape. However, by the end of 1996, the bottom had fallen out of it. When Pulp got to No 2 with Common People, it felt like a subversion of the mainstream, but when Oasis headlined Knebworth just over a year later, it felt like the opposite. As a 15-year-old at the time, I eagerly awaited the release of new Blur music, with a realisation that it was either going to lead me to turn my back on the genre altogether, or take me on a new voyage of discovery. I remember listening to the first Radio 1 play with my blank cassette ready so I could listen to it again immediately and decide whether or not I liked it. The first thing that was obvious was how different it was \u2013 how unlike a hit single it sounded with its discordant guitar and sleepy vocals. The lyrics were pretty impenetrable too (apparently about heroin?) but it soon grew on me, and as I\u2019d hoped, led me to discover a whole manner of new music from Pavement and Sonic Youth to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/from-the-archive-blog/2018/nov/09/beatles-white-album-review-november-1968\">White Album</a>. (It seems improbable now, but in the 90s, if your parents didn\u2019t own these classic albums, you had no access to them.) I still love the song. I think it\u2019s the perfect summation of what Blur are all about \u2013 a bit arty and obtuse but with an undeniable melodic core and, especially apparent in the outro, one of the best guitarists in pop music history. It changed the musical landscape too and, along with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/jun/24/pulp-10-of-the-best\">This is Hardcore</a>, demonstrated how empty so much of Britpop was, and meaning that by the following year, music had again moved on. <strong>Jamie Taylor</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ddz-rRI16k\">Wizzard</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ddz-rRI16k\">: Angel Fingers</a></h2> <p>You know that Goldwyn saying about a film starting with an earthquake and building up to a climax?

There\u2019s a lot of anodyne traditional pop in those early days, a lot of which is completely forgettable. This one, released in 1955 and first on top in January 1956, was the second one to really wow me (after the wonderful Rock Around the Clock) and is a departure from most No 1s at the time. It\u2019s quite dark, chronicling the monotony and futility of a coal miner as he trudges through each day. Merle Travis\u2019s lyrics have a timeless quality and still seem relevant in some professions today, with the unforgettable chorus \u201cYou load 16 tons and what do you get? / Another day older and deeper in debt\u201d. Ford\u2019s tenor voice underscores the miner\u2019s plight with a real grittiness and, honestly, sounds very cool. Perhaps not the same kind of cool as Bill Haley\u2019s Comets, but a sort of weary, wise cool. It\u2019s also worth talking about the instrumentation here \u2013&nbsp;while it\u2019s mostly minimal, with a catchy bassline underscored with finger clicks, there\u2019s also a flourish here and there from trumpets, trombone and clarinet to punctuate the mood, with the latter beginning and ending the song nicely. And to think the top-selling single of that year was Pat Boone\u2019s tepid I\u2019ll Be Home. Ugh. <strong>Will</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8OipmKFDeM\">Oasis</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8OipmKFDeM\">: Don\u2019t Look Back in Anger</a></h2> <p>I was 14 when (What\u2019s the Story) Morning Glory? came out. [I was] impressionable, naive, just getting into music, and it sounded incredible. The lyrics meant nothing, but with a drink inside you and an arm round your mate, they meant everything. Like so many of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/05/noel-gallagher-i-liked-my-mum-until-she-gave-birth-to-liam\">Noel Gallagher</a>\u2019s songs, it\u2019s not one you think about. You feel it. When those big stolen piano chords start and lead into that descending melody, melancholic, celebratory, somehow defiant, universal \u2013 who can say they\u2019ve not been told by their mum \u201cTake that look from off your face\u201d? \u2013 you feel it in your stomach. This is a great song. It\u2019s a song that\u2019s meant the world to me throughout the years, the start of relationships and the end of them, but it got a new meaning in 2017. I was a journalist at Granada Reports, ITV\u2019s news programme for the north-west, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/manchester-arena-explosion\">22 people were killed</a> at Manchester Arena. I was news editor the day after the bomb, when students from Chetham\u2019s School of Music, mere yards from the arena, sang the song outside their school, with their arms round each other. Defiant. I produced the main news programme on the Thursday. That was the day <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/may/25/dont-look-back-in-anger-becomes-symbol-of-manchester-spirit\">Lydia Bernsmeier-Rullow broke into Don\u2019t Look Back </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/may/25/dont-look-back-in-anger-becomes-symbol-of-manchester-spirit\">in Anger</a> in the middle of St Ann\u2019s Square, surrounded by hundreds of people silently paying their respects. Slowly, they joined in. A bloke shouted, \u201cCome on, sing up\u201d, and the crowd swelled as one: \u201cShe knows it\u2019s too late, as she\u2019s walking on by / Her soul slides away / But don\u2019t look back in anger / Don\u2019t look back in anger / I heard you say\u201d. Goosebumps then, now and forever. </p> <p>At the We Are Manchester charity gig Noel said some words that only seem to get more relevant as the world unravels around us: \u201cEvery time you sing, we win.\u201d This, for me, is the greatest No 1 ever. <strong>Paul Duckworth</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFacWGBJ_cs\">Joe Dolce</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFacWGBJ_cs\">: Shaddap You Face</a></h2> <p>My all-time favourite UK number one is Shaddap You Face by Joe Dolce. Hear me out with this. Even though I was brought up on the likes of Talking Heads, the Clash, Bowie, the Smiths and all the other post-punk, new wave and indie bands that it is achingly trendy to namedrop, I always had a soft spot for Shaddap You Face. I don\u2019t mean this in an ironic, \u201clook at me\u201d kind of way. I really like it. Yes, it\u2019s a novelty song. Yes, it is terrible. Probably. But is that such a bad thing? For me, I can\u2019t think of many other songs that can put a smile on your face as much as this one. My love for it was cemented when I moved to Italy a few years ago for work, and found the Italian people to be a mirror of the song \u2013 playful, friendly, upbeat, good fun. I have played it to many Italian people I have met, and they love it! One of them would even say to me \u201cWhatsa matter you?\u201d every time he greeted me after listening to it. Is it better than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/27/the-100-greatest-uk-no-1s\">Ghost Town, Wuthering Heights, West End Girls</a>, etc? No. Does it make you smile more than those songs? Absolutely. And sometimes that is what pop music is all about. Just good, simple fun. And anything that keeps Vienna by Ultravox off the top spot for three weeks must be doing something right, right? <strong>Anon</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tJYN-eG1zk\">Queen</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tJYN-eG1zk\">: We Will Rock You</a></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tJYN-eG1zk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-tJYN-eG1zk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>After a very traumatic period it reminded me that I could still rock and should not go quietly into a long goodnight.

Like Marcel Duchamp\u2019s Fountain (a signed urinal placed in an art gallery), this may not be classic Art, but works as a piece of conceptual, situationist art. Yes, it\u2019s a mash-up, relying entirely on a cacophonous mix of samples (Dr Who theme, the Sweet\u2019s Block Buster!, Gary Glitter\u2019s Rock and Roll Part 2 \u2013 even Daleks voicing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/aug/31/harry-enfield-and-paul-whitehouse-a-double-act-that-gets-better-with-age\">Harry Enfield\u2019s \u201cbosh bosh bosh loadsamoney</a>\u201d). Yes Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty were taking the proverbial, but at the same time the song is a catchy, bizarre and joyful riot of noise. Variety is the spice of life and so it is with No 1s. You wouldn\u2019t want something like Doctorin\u2019 the Tardis to be No 1 every week, but it deserves its place. To be No 1, you have to sell more records (back in the day) than any other artist that week. The KLF (I mean, the Timelords) did it that week. They made \u201cloadsamoney\u201d, but later burned \u00a31m of it, which goes to show I don\u2019t quite know what, except that they were in it for something other than money. A No 1 pop single must be catchy and tap into the mood of the moment, but (like most things) it is also something quite disposable. <strong>Simon Briggs</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n327ncoU_ZU\">Johnny Kidd &amp; the Pirates</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n327ncoU_ZU\">: Shakin\u2019 All Over</a></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n327ncoU_ZU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/n327ncoU_ZU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Fifties chart music by British artists was either polite pop or anodyne Elvis impersonators. In August 1960, before the Beatles and the Stones, the most original rock\u2018n\u2019roll record ever produced in this country topped the charts for one week only. It was intended as a B-side and hastily written in the cramped basement of a London coffee shop among crates of Coca-Cola the night before recording, and nothing like this had been heard before by national listeners. What makes Shakin\u2019 All Over a worthy inclusion on your list? That opening electric glissando riff, drenched in echo and aided by a cigarette lighter sliding up and down the fretboard. The white-coated EMI technicians said such a sound wasn\u2019t possible as it wasn\u2019t in their manual. The loud prowling bass and vocals first proved that rock\u2018n\u2019roll singing didn\u2019t have to parrot an American. Exciting, heavy, raunchy and seedy, it\u2019s a much covered song that still occupies a special place in the core repertoire of rock\u2018n\u2019roll. Not bad for a tune apparently recorded in six minutes, less time than it took to set up the equipment. <strong>Gareth Miles</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oofSnsGkops\">James Blunt</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oofSnsGkops\">: You\u2019re Beautiful</a></h2> <p>2020 is such an abomination that it\u2019s almost criminal to not include the one song that would make everyone completely lose their shit and allow them to forget killer viruses and killer cops for just one pure, beautiful moment. <strong>Nathan Green</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwZNL7QVJjE\">Ben E King</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwZNL7QVJjE\">: Stand By Me</a></h2> <p>It does what the best pop always does.

What an effortless soaring melody. That bass line. It\u2019s so easy to sing along to. And everybody does, \u2018cos it gives everybody a heart and a soul, even if they didn\u2019t have either when it kicked in. You feel like you\u2019re Ben E King when you sing it, even if you sound like King Kong. Lyrically it remains universally poignant, potent and forever pertinent.

The new millennium hadn\u2019t started well. The alleged \u201cend of history\u201d had quickly been replaced by new horrible history-making: world-traumatising acts of terrorism, dubiously justified and grottily fought wars, torture (and torture porn), a seemingly worst ever (to that point) administration in the White House, apocalyptic fears of global pandemics, of stop-at-no-cost immigrants ... Crazy was the wholly logical response; the only sane way of coping. CeeLo Green sounds frantic, his voice trying to escape the gravity of the song\u2019s melancholy while the naggingly addictive spaghetti western sample reels us back in like a whirlpool with him. That their Top of the Pops appearances included an even more stately slowed down version made this event TV, an emotional affirmation of the hysteria we were all feeling and confirmation that we weren\u2019t alone in feeling it.

There was definitely something in the air: yes, a lot of that was due to certain chemicals but it seemed to go much deeper. Football hooliganism started to go down. I remember in a club one night, accidentally knocking into someone and their drink spilling. In the past, this might have led to aggro, but, during this period, no problem and no fighting on the dancefloor. Different music cultures seemed to blend together. No one seemed to get that blend better than Soul II Soul. And this was happening when the cold war was ending. The good vibrations were spreading out into the world, peace was going to break out and the future was going to be so much better. When I think back to that time, and see how the world is now, I almost want to cry. Also to me at least, it seemed to be when UK soul music created its own identity, separate from the US. That is the cultural background. But it is also such a hypnotic swaying blissful piece of music.

The song is a poetic description of [Hendrix\u2019s] own dynamic and visceral playing, his guitar is indeed chopping down mountains and then picking up grains of sand. There are huge dynamics in every move he makes. He is too quick to be bombastic; the music veers between solo, chords and glissandi in an epic tour de force. While his guitar could do plenty of talking, his vocal prowess matches it. The casual belief in his own boasting is delivered with complete authority and an infectious enthusiasm. Whispering asides, even apologies, are made before he ascends into the next world, screaming with dramatic urgency: \u201cDon\u2019t be late.\u201d The lyrics, while suggesting he has god-like powers, also contain genuine concern, with lines from a love song worried that he will \u201ctake up all your sweet time\u201d. Still, before long he is an alien again, there is another world out there, the counterculture, and out there God knows he\u2019s a voodoo child. Just listen: his guitar tells you all you need to know. <strong>Douglas Cape</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOnYY9Mw2Fg\">The Righteous Brothers</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOnYY9Mw2Fg\">: You\u2019ve Lost That Lovin\u2019 Feeling</a></h2> <p>You\u2019ve chosen the wrong male duo for your No 1 \u2013 the Brothers not the Boys would have made more sense. For such a seminal masterpiece not even to be in the Top 100 at all is such a blinding blatant omission it beggars belief \u2013&nbsp;akin to neglecting to include Citizen Kane in a list of the hundred greatest films of all time. It means a great deal to me because at the time it was the subject of a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/entertainment-arts-25024587/the-righteous-brothers-1965-chart-battle-with-cilla-black\">battle between this American original and the British cover version</a>. They were neck and neck for the prized chart top slot and this fight was reflected in my school playground, where I gained the battle scars in my defence of this great record by these unknown artists, but it was worth it when my side won and it reached No 1. I loved this blue-eyed soul classic so much because as a young teenager it was the first time a record enveloped me in its own sound and atmosphere and moved me emotionally. Now, all these decades later it still impacts on me the same way and it stands the test of time as a perfect pop record and work of art. <strong>Gordon Roome</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNIPqafd4As\">C</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNIPqafd4As\">\u00e9line Dion</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNIPqafd4As\">: My Heart Will Go On</a></h2> <p>The reason I love it is not because I love the song above all others, far from it. But because it embodies best how music can provide Proustian flashbacks and emotions you may have long forgotten. So firstly, it reminds me of attending my first teen birthday party bash, in which it was played every 10 minutes in order to aid these ritualistic snogging fests. Under the critical gaze of more experienced 13-year-olds I nervously danced with Zoe, who told everyone I was shaking (I was not). This was then followed by an excruciatingly awkward hands-holding waltz with Katie, my first crush who \u2013 unbeknownst to me \u2013 already had a boyfriend and as it transpired was merely pawning me into some kind of mind-game jealousy between the two of them. But now when I hear that song I can look back and appreciate how ludicrous we all were and how thankful I am to have grown a more thicker, existential skin when it comes to public humility and failed desires. The song never contained an innocence or romance for me like it was perhaps intended. But it provided a valuable benchmark for me on what romance isn\u2019t. <strong>J</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"86d7a5aeccc305c722d047314cc003b76bad69d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86d7a5aeccc305c722d047314cc003b76bad69d0/0_0_1524_2368/644.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Ant in 1981\" width=\"644\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Ant in 1981.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Young/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p__WmyAE3g\">Adam and the Ants</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p__WmyAE3g\">: Prince Charming</a></h2> <p>My first crush.

So much beauty and style, the overblown video (Diana Dors, for heaven\u2019s sake!), the ridiculous dance \u2013 it was amazing and thrilling and utterly alien to everything that had gone before. It was impenetrable to grown-ups, which only increased its appeal. I didn\u2019t have a record player and my parents only listened to Radio 2. I lived for the brief snippets I could catch on Saturday morning TV or at a friend\u2019s house. Adam Ant encapsulated the glamour and excitement of the city and this record was Peak Ant.

There is no wonder it had such a tear-jerking sung response from the crowd at the 2005 Live 8 concert. Despite being around six at the time, I can genuinely remember realising the unparalleled ecstasy and feeling of togetherness that only live music can bring when watching this, albeit televised, performance. And yet, both lyrically and musically, this song has layers. It is anthemic but intimate; soothing and, at the same time, raging. The band\u2019s project is big, as they list off a never-ending list of social ills that they sentimentally believe can be solved with love \u2013 perhaps this is why it speaks so much to a childish impulse. But not only does it criticise the blatant racism and division in society, it also acknowledges the part played by those who do not \u201cpractise what they preach\u201d. To me, this sentiment feels more relevant than ever. For a generation of young people who sing this blissfully at the top of their lungs, it is not only a nostalgic reminder of childhood but a reminder of how to act now. <strong>Will Owen</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isAXzsQFthQ\">Chef</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isAXzsQFthQ\">: Chocolate Salty Balls</a></h2> <p>Puerile, offensive and perhaps Isaac Hayes\u2019s biggest hit!

It held off <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMYg_Ra4cr8\">David Bowie\u2019s The Jean Genie</a> from the top spot, a song with which it shares an almost identical riff, though both parties claimed this was coincidental. Nor do the mysteries end there, for Block Buster has inspired all manner of theories. In its opening seconds a blaring police alarm merges with the kind of scuzzy licks that REM would later channel for Monster. Brian Connolly\u2019s anxious vocal warns us about the perils of having long black hair, while in the second verse Buster\u2019s \u201ccrimes\u201d extend to womanising, or far worse. Quite why the law is in such flux over this man isn\u2019t explained, but the tension is palpable with pounding kettle drums and a mad-eyed finale like the baying of some lynch mob. Were those bellicose sirens and drums a reference to Blockbuster bombs used by the RAF in World War II? Or does the \u201cevil\u201d Buster, a predator and master of disguise, signify our fears of sexual abuse? Steve Priest\u2019s puzzled cry \u201cWe just haven\u2019t got a clue what to do\u201d soon descends into an incoherent babble, such is the chaos left by Buster. Whatever the elusive Buster did wrong, this song\u2019s message was that everyone wanted him gone, never to be heard from again. It left my 10-year-old self exhilarated by the sheer drama of its deadlocked chase. But who was I siding with back then? The perspiring cops, or this villain who offered me a window into some illicit adult world? <strong>Gareth Thompson</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiaY2GQuuzA\">JJ Barrie</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiaY2GQuuzA\">: No Charge</a></h2> <p>In the hot, hazy summer of 1976, when the tar literally melted on the roads, a kind of collective madness overtook Britain. Suddenly, bafflingly, a seemingly insatiable public appetite for mawkish country songs saw a succession of novelty one-hit wonders shoot up the charts, inevitably to be quickly followed by a dismal parody by Billy Connolly. It was into this febrile atmosphere that JJ Barrie launched this rhinestone encrusted grenade, and that June the peerlessly terrible No Charge was No 1 for one single glorious week.</p> <p>If, like me, you love a song with a story, strap yourself in. A little boy unsuspectingly approaches his parents with a list of chores he\u2019s undertaken \u2013 made his bed, taken out the rubbish, that kind of thing \u2013 and suggests that they reward him for his endeavours. True, he does seem to be pushing his luck a little (25 cents for \u201cplaying with his little brother\u201d) but this being America you might have expected them to praise his nascent entrepreneurialism. Not a bit of it. Instead, they embark on an epic musical guilt trip, outlining the expense, pain and just plain inconvenience their son has wreaked on his mother\u2019s life. Mom croons plaintively in the background while dad delivers her wounded response in a \u201cnot angry, just disappointed\u201d voice: \u201cFor the nine months I carried you, growin\u2019 inside me \u2013 no charge.\u201d \u201cFor the toys, food and clothes and even for wipin\u2019 your nose \u2013 there\u2019s no charge, son.\u201d Well, maybe not yet. But the cost of years in therapy after your parents go to the lengths of recording and releasing a novelty passive aggressive country song detailing your extreme ingratitude? Exorbitant. <strong>Sam Turner</strong></p>",

Her recent book, American Resistance, tracked the impact of the 2017 Women\u2019s March held the day after Trump\u2019s inauguration.</p> <p>Studying the data, she found that much of the energy released on that day \u2013 the largest day of protest in American history \u2013 was channeled back into local communities and their congressional races.

Fisher thinks there is.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it will be unpopular to say this, but I think there is a need for some professionalized organizational ecosystem to support this movement. There is a void forming, and we need to fill it.\u201d</p> <p>Noam Chomsky also sees a need for greater strategic direction. He wonders whether popular movements will emerge \u201cthat seek to deal with the brutal legacy of 400 years of vicious racism, that extends far beyond police violence\u201d.</p> <p>Nelini Stamp is resolutely optimistic. She reminds us that Black Lives Matter was founded in 2013, took off the following year during the Ferguson, Missouri, protests over the police killing of Michael Brown, and has been beavering away at effecting change ever since.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been a movement for black lives over the past six years that has never stopped.

They will be the first to assess the look and feel of the world of commercialised leisure time in which many of us used to spend our weekends.</p> <p>With warehouses of unsold summer stock to shift, retailers are at pains to do everything they can to make customers feel safe. Some of the basics will be universal. In-store numbers will be strictly limited, so expect queues outside. Stores with more than one door may operate separate entrances and exits to avoid face-to-face contact at these points. Masks will be worn by staff, and shoppers will be encouraged to follow suit. Contactless payment will be encouraged (expect a push on Apple Pay and other mobile payment services, which are not usually subject to the \u00a345 limit)<strong> </strong>and sanitiser pumps stationed by each cash desk. Only household members can shop together, and lift occupancy will be limited to one person or those from one household.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Order several pieces at once \u2013 if you only order one, you might convince yourself you like it to avoid returning it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lots of things will vary between stores, however. In the first wave, many will open only those branches whose customer base can travel by foot, bike or car. John Lewis will keep changing rooms closed for now, but Reiss and Gap will open some, with rigorous sanitising between customers.</p> <p>Jewellery and watches will be particularly challenging to try on, as the virus can live on metal for much longer than on fabric. Most stores have extended their returns policy to encourage shoppers to try clothes on at home; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/27/john-lewis-announces-first-wave-of-store-reopenings-coronavirus\">John Lewis is considering installing \u201cdrop boxes\u201d</a> at store entry points, so that returns need not add to in-store footfall. Some shops will open for shorter hours so that staff don\u2019t need to travel at rush hour, others will open for longer to spread out footfall. Selfridges is considering reducing the amount of stock on the shop floor so that shoppers can give each other more space. <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8396107/Harrods-open-outlet-pop-store-West-London-shopping-centre.html\">Harrods will open an outlet at the west London Westfield</a> shopping centre in July where the traditional tightly packed sales rails can have more room. Most stores will keep cafes closed, but 49 Marks &amp; Spencer stores will sell takeout coffees. Some stores will have toilets open \u2013 but as one PR told me off the record, those that will aren\u2019t keen to broadcast the fact and become de facto public toilets while few alternatives are available.</p> <p>Even the greatest cheerleader for the embattled retail industry would struggle to frame this as an enticing day out. Vigilance over meticulous hygiene may reassure customers that they are safe, but that is not the same as making them feel relaxed, happy and in the mood to spend. After all, until three months ago, bricks-and-mortar retail relied on delivering a fun experience to tempt shoppers offline \u2013 and \u201csterile\u201d was one of the most damning verdicts you could deliver.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5bb6a30e6e3a2ac890f64a10b4816182fb2d982a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bb6a30e6e3a2ac890f64a10b4816182fb2d982a/0_270_4859_2915/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Expect queues \u2026 waiting to get into a reopened clothes shop in Switzerland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Expect queues \u2026 waiting to get into a reopened clothes shop in Switzerland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurent Gilli\u00e9ron/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But there are already signs that a new genre of IRL shopping trip could begin to emerge. The lost art of window shopping, for instance, is enjoying a renaissance. During the pandemic, Mixology, a teenage fashion store on the Upper East Side of New York, resisted boarding up its windows and instead installed new outfits in the windows with a sign reading: \u201cSee something you like in the window? Feel free to text or call,\u201d with the shopkeepers\u2019 phone numbers listed. Where fashion stores have reopened in other city centres, retailers have repurposed their windows from abstract, artsy cubes to showcases for key looks available in store, encouraging shoppers to do their initial browse of the selection in the open air and without touching any stock.</p> <p>\u201cYou need a plan,\u201d says Helen Seamons, the Guardian\u2019s menswear fashion editor and a gold-standard shopper, when I ask for her tips for a successful physically distanced shopping trip. \u201cThe age of the aimless browse is over for now. And the etiquette of flicking through rails seems doubtful. So do an online recce and save screenshots to your phone of pieces you like. That way you can ask staff where they are, and reduce your wandering-about time.\u201d Some small neighbourhood boutiques that will have capacity for only one or two shoppers at a time plan to offer short bookable appointments rather than having customers lined up outside.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aff92bb8550d0a96278d45b5e601ce8124dd7d39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aff92bb8550d0a96278d45b5e601ce8124dd7d39/0_47_3206_1923/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A shop in Moscow preparing to reopen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A shop in Moscow preparing to reopen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mikhail Tereshchenko/TASS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alternatively, this could be the time to pivot to online clothes shopping. The best place to start is with a brand you already wear, so that you have a good sense of what size you take and a realistic expectation of what the fabric and finish will be, these being tricky to assess online. Melanie Wilkinson, the Guardian\u2019s styling editor, suggests: \u201cThis probably isn\u2019t the best time to buy a new pair of jeans \u2013 historically, the one item that requires hours of trying on. Continue to embrace the smart jogging-bottom trend of lockdown instead. You can wear these with silk blouses and relaxed shirts, which are easier to shop for online.\u201d Order several pieces at once and expect to send most of them back \u2013 if you only order one item, you might be tempted to convince yourself you like it to save the bother of returning it. But whether you are shopping in store or online, you won\u2019t be taking anyone with you into a changing room for a while.</p> <p>To recreate shopping with friends, consider setting up a WhatsApp group for honest advice so that each of you can try on new purchases in front of the mirror and send selfies for feedback. (Consider carefully who you want to include in this group. Does their taste match with yours? How much brutal honesty is too much? Will it annoy you if they copy what you buy?)</p> <p>Things will get better. Swifter sanitising systems, some using ozone-based technology and others ultraviolet light, are being worked on, with a view to reducing the quarantine time for clothes that customers have been handled to an hour or less. <a href=\"https://www.zara.com/uk/en/help/sizes-h11.html\">Zara already has an online fit tool</a> that uses your height, weight and body shape to recommend which size you buy \u2013 so far, this has always worked out for me, although the hit rate is inconsistent between different body shapes and sizes. Amazon is developing an app that will <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6637217/Amazon-develops-virtual-fitting-room-dress-version-built-social-media.html\">\u201cdata mine\u201d photos from your phone to create a bespoke virtual mannequin</a> that accurately represents your body shape, which can then \u201ctry on\u201d clothes. The new normal is a strange place. Anyone for retail therapy?</p>",

  "<p><strong>I\u2019m an NHS worker who was inspired to buy a Brompton bike after using one through its Wheels for Heroes campaign during lockdown. I purchased it online through Cycle Republic, which is owned by Halfords. Within the first week the connecting chain to the gear hub fell off while I was cycling to work. I contacted Cycle Republic which did not respond. I contacted Brompton directly and it promptly arranged for a local dealer to replace the part. Within three weeks, the gear shifter broke and the bolts fell off the rear mudguard.</strong></p> <p><strong>I have spent every day since talking with Cycle Republic, Halfords and Brompton.&nbsp;Cycle Republic stores were closed in April by Halfords and its customer service team stopped replying after a single response. Halfords tells me the bike is not its responsibility as it was purchased from Cycle Republic, despite the fact that all the packaging and paperwork bears the Halfords name.</strong></p> <p><strong>Brompton tells me it is not responsible as it was purchased from Cycle Republic.&nbsp;It has offered to arrange for a local dealer to look at the bike but at my expense, although there is a manufacturer\u2019s warranty.</strong></p> <p><strong>I spent \u00a31,200 on an unusable bike that I need for my job working with vulnerable patients in the community.<br></strong><em><strong>DB, London</strong></em></p> <p>Your email arrived three weeks after another distress call from a Cycle Republic customer whose \u00a3345 bike did not materialise. <em><strong>EM</strong></em> of <em><strong>Farnham, Surrey</strong></em> reported that the company was uncontactable, while continuing to trade online.</p> <p>Halfords closed all of its Cycle Republic shops in March after announcing it was divesting itself of its performance cycling business and seeking buyers for the outlets. \u201cIt is unclear who is the current owner and therefore responsible for its operations right now,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt is unclear whether there are any staff still working for the company and unclear what customers should do once they have essentially handed over their money with no idea if Cycle Republic will honour the contract they have entered into.\u201d</p> <p>When I contacted Halfords, it confirmed that Cycle Republic was still open for business and cancelled and refunded <em><strong>EM</strong></em>\u2019s order. Unprecedented demand for bicycles during lockdown had overwhelmed its helplines, it explains, and it had recruited more staff to contact frustrated customers.</p> <p>Not much appears to have changed, however. Almost all the reviews on Trustpilot since lockdown report lack of delivery, response or redress for faulty items.

These protests were initially prompted by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/09/george-floyd-killing-triggers-wave-of-activism-around-the-world\">killing of George Floyd in the US</a> and systemic racism everywhere, but they may finally force us into a thorough examination of the British empire and its role in slavery.<br><br>Born in Bristol in 1636, Colston was the preeminent slave trader of his day, and during the time of his involvement with the Royal African Company \u2013 between 1680 to 1692 \u2013 it is estimated that the company transported some 84,000 Africans to the Caribbean and the Americas, of whom 19,000 died on the way.</p> <p>In the decades that followed Colston\u2019s death in 1721, another slave merchant rose to notoriety in Bristol: Samuel Span. Span headed the influential Society of Merchant Venturers, which had once petitioned parliament to lift the monopoly granted to the Royal African Company over the slave trade so that it could join it.</p> <p>Span resonates on a personal level, because not only did he own the Caribbean island to which my African forebears were brought to work as slaves, he himself was also my ancestor.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/09/protests-british-history\">These anti-racism protests show it's time for Britain to grapple with its difficult history | Olivette Otele</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those clamouring for change must also make demands on behalf of those \u2013 in the Caribbean and beyond \u2013 who have been hard-hit by men like Colston and Span. They must begin to speak of reparations.</p> <p>In 1763, at the conclusion of the seven years\u2019 war, France ceded to Britain the islands of St Vincent and the Grenadines, which included tiny Union Island, where my family have lived for generations. Span, then a naval chief, was rewarded with the island, giving him absolute control over its slaves. He set about transporting more Africans on Bristol-crewed vessels to work on the island\u2019s cotton plantations. The island\u2019s slave population reached a peak of 635 in 1822. Span named the island\u2019s two main settlements after <a href=\"https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/story-the-clifton-ashton-remarkable-3970925\">places in Bristol</a>: Clifton and Ashton. Today, my late grandmother\u2019s home faces the sea in Ashton, Union Island.<br><br>When <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/2146645485\">Span</a><a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/2146645485\"> died</a> in 1796, his vast fortune \u2013 which includes Union Island, and ran into the millions of pounds in today\u2019s money \u2013 was left to his English children. Other descendants who worked to create the family\u2019s wealth would not see a single penny.</p> <p>In the early 2000s I moved to Clifton, Bristol, for my undergraduate degree at the University of Bristol, which was founded with money <a href=\"https://www.bristol.ac.uk/university/history/past-matters/\">derived</a> from the sale of tobacco produced on plantations in the American south that once held slaves.<br><br>That the university had failed to address the racism and elitism upon which it was founded seemed glaringly obvious. There were only a handful of black students. And over the three years I spent there, I did not see a single black academic. Last year the student union called on the university to commission an independent review into <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-50788321\">\u201cinstitutionalised racism\u201d</a> after a slew of incidents.<br><br>Racism still appears to loom large in Bristol\u2019s recent history, too. It is worth remembering that the city\u2019s African-Caribbean community, inspired by Rosa Parks\u2019s refusal to give up her seat on a bus in Alabama, <a href=\"https://www.blackhistorymonth.org.uk/article/section/bhm-heroes/the-bristol-bus-boycott-of-1963/\">led a boycott</a> of the local bus service in 1963, protesting against widespread racial discrimination in employment and housing.<br><br>The boycott is considered to have been an influence on the passing of the landmark Race Relations Acts of 1965 and 1968, which outlawed racial discrimination in employment and housing \u2013 a reminder that direct action has brought about change. Failure to tackle poor housing and the over-policing of black communities were among the factors that led to <a href=\"https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/st-pauls-riots-37-years-17634\">riots in April 1980</a> in St Paul\u2019s, an inner-city neighbourhood with historic importance for the African-Caribbean community (now the area is undergoing rapid gentrification). <br><br>Today, Colston\u2019s toppling and subsequent drowning in the waters of Bristol\u2019s harbour, where his slave ships once docked, should force the city \u2013 and the country as a whole \u2013 into a wider reckoning about racism and empire.<br><br>In fact, the process has already begun: last year the University of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/oct/30/olivette-otele-uk-first-black-female-history-professor-to-research-bristol-slavery-links\">Bristol appointed</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/oct/30/olivette-otele-uk-first-black-female-history-professor-to-research-bristol-slavery-links\"> Olivette Otele</a> as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/09/protests-british-history\">professor of the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/09/protests-british-history\">history of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/09/protests-british-history\">slavery</a>, with a mandate to investigate the institution\u2019s and the city\u2019s links to the trade.</p> <p>But what about Union Island?</p> <p>Unionites continued to live in poverty long after slaves were freed in 1838. The island had to wait until the mid-1970s to gain access to electricity, just before St Vincent and the Grenadines won its independence from Britain. Labelled the Tahiti of the Caribbean, because of its lush volcanic silhouette set in sparkling coral-laden seas, Union attracts an international cast of wealthy jetsetters \u2013 even though its 3,000 or so permanent residents find themselves grinding through a third year of recession. Unemployment and poverty are rife. <br><br>Statues in tribute to the likes of Colston and Span in British cities rightly seem abhorrent to many. But the material damage they wrought was felt far beyond these shores \u2013 it is high time that the damage is fully accounted for.</p> <p>We in the UK need to begin a national debate on reparations for slavery, a crime which heralded the age of capitalism and provided the basis for racism that continues to endanger black life globally. It will follow a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/13/reparations-slavery-congress-hearing-ta-nehisi-coates-danny-glover\">landmark US Congress</a> hearing on the topic last year.</p> <p>Protesters making demands of British institutions and examining the individuals who profited from slavery, must also follow the money trail to places such as Union Island. Our vision for change must be global because Britain, after all, was a vast empire.</p> <p>\u2022 Amandla Thomas-Johnson is a freelance foreign correspondent based in Dakar, Senegal</p>",

Many will deny that they supported him and some will even believe that. Shame drives out awkward memories and scrubs consciences clean.</p> <p>That is trickier for those who put their enthusiasm on the record. None outdid Michael Gove, comparing Trump to George Washington. The first president had also been misunderstood by Britain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/15/michael-gove-uk-interview-tory-times\">Gove wrote</a> in an unctuous interview with the 45th. He cast Trump as a \u201cforce of nature\u201d who did not merit the \u201cscorn and condescension\u201d of his UK critics.&nbsp;To compensate for his countrymen\u2019s discourtesy, Gove posed with his subject, grinning and giving the thumbs-up.</p> <p>In the gallery of cringing subservience that image can hang alongside Theresa May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/jan/27/trump-may-hold-hands-white-house-video\">holding the president\u2019s hand</a> during her first visit to the White House. Later that day, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/28/trump-immigration-ban-syria-muslims-reaction-lawsuits\">issued executive order 13769</a> \u2013 the entry ban on nationals from predominantly Muslim countries. May did not condemn it.</p> <p>Some said there was a better man behind the mask, but there was no mask. The racist snarl, the bully\u2019s sneer and the infantile pout were all his. The face of the campaign was true to the character of the candidate. The only way to see a nobler Trump was to mould one from delusion, cowardice and self-interest \u2013 plentiful resources in a government embarking on Brexit.</p> <p>Those who found Trump\u2019s appeals to white nationalism a little vulgar retreated to arguments based on realpolitik. The transatlantic relationship is bigger than personalities, they said. We honour the office of president, regardless of who sits there. That diplomatic rationale led Britain to roll out what Jacob Rees-Mogg boasted should be \u201c<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/donald-trump-uk-visit-jacob-reesmogg-address-parliament-a8337946.html\">the reddest of red carpets</a>\u201d for a state visit.</p> <p>The problem is that Trump is a malignancy eating away at the authority of his office. He has no concept of alliances based on mutual interest. Like any despot, he demands submission, then despises as weaklings those who submit. Britain\u2019s loyalty should be to the institutions of liberal democracy in the US and around the world that Trump attacks.</p> <p>Angela Merkel got the tone right. The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/11/09/angela-merkel-congratulates-donald-trump-kind-of/\">German </a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/11/09/angela-merkel-congratulates-donald-trump-kind-of/\">chancellor\u2019s message</a> marking Trump\u2019s victory was more&nbsp;rebuke&nbsp;than congratulation. She itemised the ethical foundations of partnership between democracies, \u201cthe rule of law and the dignity of each and every person, regardless of their origin, skin colour, creed, gender, sexual orientation, or political views\u201d. She offered cooperation \u201cbased on these values\u201d.</p> <p>Back in Westminster, giddy Brexiteers scoffed at Merkel\u2019s piety, which they took as a symptom of strategic decline. New power alignments were coming into focus, the old order was unravelling and Berlin was disadvantaged by its lack of a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the US. Forget Brussels, London had Washington on its side.</p> <p>The chancellor\u2019s critics underestimated her own capacity for hard-headed realpolitik. She identifies Germany\u2019s interests with the European Union as part of the broad apparatus of international rules-based cooperation. When Trump hurls aggressive rhetoric at those structures, when he calls the EU a \u201cfoe\u201d, when he lavishes praise on authoritarian rulers, Merkel listens. She does not gamble on apologist interpretations of what he really meant to say.<br><br>There is a certain type of squeamish Trump fellow-traveller who, embarrassed by displays of actual fascism, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/31/peter-thiel-defends-donald-trump-muslim-ban-mexico-wall\">draws a distinction</a> between taking the president&nbsp;<em>literally</em>&nbsp;and taking him&nbsp;<em>seriously</em>. It is a clever formula, usually attributed to the libertarian tech billionaire Peter Thiel, but probably not coined by him. This rhetorical device is used to exonerate people who rally to hateful language on the grounds that they are responding to some deeper meaning. The thuggish misogyny and racist provocations are just short-cuts, like icons on a desktop leading to a more sophisticated program. By a feat of moral gymnastics, the nastiness could then be justified as empathic rage, expressing the legitimate concerns of humble Americans, traduced by metropolitan globalists.<br><br>But Trump despises the people who elected him. His economic policy transfers their money into the pockets of his family and friends. He befouled American public administration, leaving the country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/01/donald-trump-coronavirus-boris-johnson-failures-president\">defenceless</a> against Covid-19. It is the stuff of banal kleptocracy, but a vanguard of ideologues and broadsheet media outriders dressed it up to seem complex, profound and somehow historically inevitable.<br><br>The narrative of popular grievance seeded the liberal calamity with guilt \u2013 a burden of self-criticism placed on the losers for neglecting the terrain where Trumpism flourished. A necessary stage, perhaps, to understand electoral forces in play, but then what? The ultimate task was still resisting a tyrant.<br><br>And what did the Tory party do, meanwhile, but jostle among the sycophants and courtiers seeking favours, kidding themselves that they had influence. They shredded European alliances to make confetti for a venal egomaniac\u2019s parade, cheered by the world\u2019s autocrats who knew the grotesque carnival route led away from law and order.&nbsp;</p> <p>And what is the reward for Britain? If Trump is defeated in November, the last four years are nothing but a stain on transatlantic relations. If Trump stays, the only global role for Boris Johnson is dishevelled sidekick to a rogue superpower. Either way there is a price to pay for collusion. History will record that Britain was no mere bystander at America\u2019s tragedy, nor was it innocent.</p> <p>\u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>In 2000, after a decade of caring for his ailing mother in her large flat in Rome, Gianni Di Gregorio wrote a comedy about a bloke called Gianni who looks after his 93-year-old mother in a large flat in Rome. No one was interested in the story, in which the unemployed bachelor ends up running around after a cohort of old ladies whose spirit and vigour remain undimmed despite various ailments. Everyone thought he was crazy: who would be interested in a funny film about four old women and a middle-aged bloke?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jul/28/gianni-di-gregorio-salt-of-life\">Gianni Di Gregorio: The incidental director</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then, after a life working in the theatre and as an assistant director, Di Gregorio co-wrote the celebrated mafia drama, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/10/crime\">Gomorrah</a>, with Matteo Garrone, and his fortune changed. Garrone encouraged him to resurrect his earlier film idea and offered to produce while Di Gregorio starred and directed. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/aug/13/mid-august-lunch-review\">Mid-August Lunch</a> \u2013 a gorgeous, unsentimental comedy in which the collective naughtiness of the old ladies entertains more with each viewing \u2013 went on to win the debut director prize at the Venice film festival in 2008 and became an Italian arthouse hit.&nbsp;</p> <p>Two more films starring \u201cGianni\u201d followed: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/feb/14/the-salt-of-life-review\">The Salt of Life</a>, the celebrated sequel to Mid-August Lunch, in which Gianni\u2019s 96-year-old on-screen mother plays poker with her friends while her son laments his increasing invisibility to women (without, thank God, ever being lascivious) and the lesser known Good for Nothing, in which Gianni is a put-upon civil servant who has to learn to say no. And now there is Citizens of the World, a tender comedy in which yet another version of Gianni \u2013 this time a retired Latin professor \u2013 plots with two other pensioners to move to a country where their state pensions will go further. Until, that is, a young African migrant makes them rethink their plans.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05760bd3199c8504a9eacea0c7905f92c53efb8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05760bd3199c8504a9eacea0c7905f92c53efb8b/0_831_5886_3532/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gorgeous, unsentimental comedy \u2026 Mid-August Lunch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gorgeous, unsentimental comedy \u2026 Mid-August Lunch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I first met Di Gregorio in 2011, he took me on a tour of Rome in his 40-year-old Fiat 500, rolling cigarettes as the car bumped over the cobbles around the Colosseum and laughing about the fact that Mid-August Lunch could never have been made with old men because \u201cthey would have spent the entire film crying and being hypochondriacs! The men you see sitting in the bar in The Salt of Life won\u2019t even go to the cinema to see the film they\u2019re in, whereas the women in Mid-August Lunch were planning trips to Venice.\u201d</p> <p>And yet, during the decade that followed The Salt of Life, he changed his mind and made Citizens of the World. Why? Di Gregorio, now 71, is talking on the phone from the large flat in Rome in which he has lived with his wife and two daughters since his mother\u2019s death; I am immediately reminded of his warmth, humility and throaty laugh. \u201cI will tell you why! Matteo Garrone called me and said, \u2018<em>You</em> are the specialist when it comes to making films about old guys. <em>You</em> have to make a film about a group of male pensioners with very small pensions.\u2019 It was such a simple but brilliant idea. There aren\u2019t enough portrayals of adventurous pensioners on screen, nor explorations of friendship between men.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>The various versions of Gianni that Di Gregorio plays in his films allow the director to explore different stages of his life and, as he ages, he is finding himself more like the women planning trips to Venice than the lazy men in the bar. \u201cThe older I get, the fewer fears I have. Nowadays 70 is young! There is still so much to do, so much to explore.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27f6b44968c586c80308632c785cb0d441dbef68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27f6b44968c586c80308632c785cb0d441dbef68/0_30_1476_886/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Celebrated sequel \u2026 The Salt of Life\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Celebrated sequel \u2026 The Salt of Life</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image from film company</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2011, Di Gregorio told me that he searches for the comedy in life because he is melancholic by nature; he is also very good at using irony to explore ageing, in a similar way to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/larry-david\">Larry David</a>. Might he even be the Italian Larry David? He laughs. \u201cGrazie! Grazie! I am truly flattered by that comparison. Seeing yourself with irony is particularly important when you\u2019re in your 70s.\u201d&nbsp;<br><br>Like David\u2019s Curb Your Enthusiasm, Di Gregorio\u2019s work is about nothing and everything. There is always the portrayal of the everyday in Italy \u2013 a glass of white on the pavement outside a bar, a thin slice of pizza <em>a taglio</em> \u2013 but, in Citizens of the World, there is also open criticism of the Italian government\u2019s shameful handling of migrants. \u201cWhile I was writing about the escapades of three pensioners, there were stories on the news every day of migrants arriving in Italy on dinghies or of boats overturning and migrants drowning. I got the idea of a young African guy, Abu, hanging around with the three pensioners because I wanted to explore the notions of acceptance, of tolerance, of <em>welcoming</em> people to our country.\u201d</p> <p>He sighs. \u201cThe Italian government has imposed some very harsh laws against migrants and no one seems to know what to do. It also becomes clear in the film that Abu is the one who needs to travel the most, not the three old Romans. Something incredible happened after we finished the film: Salih Saadin Khalid, who plays Abu, is a real migrant and he used the money we paid him to leave Italy and join his family in Canada! It gave us so much joy.\u201d</p> <p>Italy is slowly easing out of lockdown and, after an initial period of \u201cblackout\u201d during which he couldn\u2019t read, write or even watch a movie, Di Gregorio is now desperate to start shooting his next film and to enjoy a glass of wine at his local bar. \u201cFood and wine are in our DNA. Italians always manage to eat well during a crisis, even if they don\u2019t have much money. It\u2019s a consolation.\u201d</p> <p>And, once the pandemic is over, might Di Gregorio consider escaping from Italy like his on-screen alter ego? He laughs, both thrilled and appalled at the idea. \u201cI haven\u2019t managed to yet! I still live in the apartment that my mother once lived in. I don\u2019t have to travel far to make my films. I am completely rooted here in Rome, like an ancient tree.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 Citizens of the World is available on <a href=\"https://www.curzonhomecinema.com/film/watch-citizens-of-the-world\">Curzon Home Cinema</a> from 12 June.<br></p>",

  "<p>Chokeholds, or \u201clateral vascular neck restraints\u201d, have been banned by many American police departments since the 1990s. This is sometimes hard to remember because there have been so many deaths since then, using precisely this technique. Chokeholds look like a kind of judo manoeuvre: an arm thrown around the neck followed by a slow squeezing pressure applied to the carotid artery. It can quickly disable an adversary, although more than a few seconds of applied pressure can kill.&nbsp;As in judo, a knee to the neck accomplishes much the same end.</p> <p>The police chokehold is a sensitive issue among African Americans. The history of black death by suffocation evokes an ugly history that is not limited to lynching with nooses. Many do not remember that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/22/rodney-king-riots-25-year-anniversary-los-angeles\">Rodney King</a> was not only beaten with batons, but that one officer, Theodore Briseno, put his foot on King\u2019s neck to hold him down.&nbsp;Perhaps because King did not die, that small fact is lost in today\u2019s discussions.&nbsp;</p> <p>But this week has been all about the dead. Eric Garner died in 2014 and his name usually begins the litany.&nbsp;He was arrested for selling \u201cloosies\u201d, or unwrapped single cigarettes. Officers threw him to the ground, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/01/eric-garner-nypd-chokehold-homicide\">applied a chokehold</a> and held him down until he died. We know this incident well because angry crowds gathered, begging officers to let him go as Garner cried out 11 times: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d We know this because bystanders took lots of pictures.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/america-george-floyd-protests-trump\">A week that shook a nation: anger burns as power of protests leaves Trump exposed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Garner\u2019s name is chanted like a mantra in the long, sad sequence of more recent deaths of black Americans, deaths by many means. Breonna Taylor, Philando Castile, Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown. That sequence now culminates with the name of George Floyd.&nbsp;Arrested on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 bill, Floyd was thrown to the ground where he succumbed after nearly nine minutes, with the full weight of police officer Derek Chauvin\u2019s knee held on his neck.&nbsp;Again crowds gathered.&nbsp;Warnings were shouted as Floyd\u2019s life slipped away.&nbsp;Clear pictures were taken.&nbsp;</p> <p>The world has exploded since then. Floyd\u2019s death has been a lightning rod for demonstrations around the planet. While much attention has centred on the behaviour of the four police officers at the scene \u2014 and particularly upon Chauvin\u2019s carelessly cavalier demeanour throughout \u2014 the harm should not be thought of as limited to these officers\u2019 behaviour, nor ought it be confined to the question of police reform. Here, for example, is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/05/30/someone-who-didnt-know-better-might-think-death-by-underlying-health-conditions-was-murder/\">the initial charging document for&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/05/30/someone-who-didnt-know-better-might-think-death-by-underlying-health-conditions-was-murder/\">Floyd\u2019s death</a>, issued by the Minneapolis medical examiner:&nbsp;\u201cThe autopsy revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.&nbsp;Mr Floyd had underlying health conditions including coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease. The combined effects of Mr Floyd being restrained by the police, his underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>This is an astonishing description, a shameful circumlocution.&nbsp;</p> <p>But of course Floyd did die by asphyxiation.&nbsp;That much is so obvious that the medical examiner\u2019s report reads like systemic bureaucratic corruption, indicating more than simply the lethal indifference of a single \u201crogue\u201d officer.&nbsp;Blaming Floyd\u2019s death on \u201cunderlying health conditions\u201d is a remarkably determined deflection of Chauvin\u2019s agency.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the end, Floyd\u2019s family hired an independent coroner who confirmed lethal asphyxiation.&nbsp;And quickly thereafter, a final report was issued by Minnesota\u2019s coroner, who logged the official cause of death as strangulation.</p> <p>The linguistic effacement of agency often directs gaze in powerful ways, tells us where to look and where not to.&nbsp;For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/21/police-release-video-of-kajieme-powell-shooting-in-st-louis\">Kajieme Powell</a> was a black man with mental health problems.&nbsp;In 2014, he took snacks from a convenience store and tossed them on the street,&nbsp;allegedly brandishing a&nbsp;steak&nbsp;knife. He called out to the police: \u201cShoot me, shoot me, shoot me, shoot me now.\u201d They obliged him, 12 times over.&nbsp;</p> <p>The police\u2019s actions were explained with what has since become a fairly common appellation,&nbsp;\u201csuicide by cop\u201d, or police-assisted suicide.&nbsp;It is an interesting deployment of the passive. It eliminates official responsibility by recasting a trigger-happy officer as the extended will of the deranged, self-sacrificing Powell.&nbsp;He did it to himself.&nbsp;No one\u2019s fault but his own.</p> <p>This is a feature of the trope of black bodies killing themselves.&nbsp;It echoes the degree to which higher rates of Covid-19 infections among African Americans are often blamed on biological difference <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/04/genetics-bame-people-die-coronavirus-structural-racism\">rather than the circumstances of their lives</a> \u2013 the toll too frequently referenced as solely the product of \u201cco-morbidities\u201d such as obesity, asthma, bad choices, genetic \u201cpropensity\u201d.&nbsp;But poverty creates petri dishes for the virus: black, poor and older people die at higher rates in America because their social circumstances have ghettoised them into tight, poisoned geographies, like bugs placed in a jar, with the cap screwed on tightly.&nbsp;</p> <p>As we watch, two great tragedies unfold and intertwine: the toll of coronavirus, and the toll of extrajudicial deaths at the hands of state actors. One maps on to the other in a double helix of grief and despair. Americans are yearning to resolve the incoherence of this moment.&nbsp;This emotional tinderbox must be read against the backdrop of other events.&nbsp;We respond not merely to the misuse of police power but also to the bewildering federal mismanagement of life-sustaining resources amid a global pandemic:&nbsp;we watch the mishandling&nbsp;in every possible way, of food distribution, of subsidies and financial assistance, of medical equipment.&nbsp;</p> <p>This perfect storm of collective smothering \u2013 a foot on all our necks \u2013&nbsp;has made the image of Floyd\u2019s death even more exceptionally powerful. It is legible to such a broad political spectrum because the resonance of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d makes us cringe with sorrow, induces frightening political constrictions, yet doubles also as coronavirus\u2019s power to make its victims literally gasp for breath.&nbsp;</p> <p>It is such a fragile moment.&nbsp;Perhaps we sit on the razor\u2019s edge of real reform. Or perhaps we will never find our way out of the linguistic maze that keeps turning the dead into deadly agents of their own demise.</p> <p>\u2022 Patricia Williams is a professor of law at Columbia University and a regular columnist for the Nation</p>",
  "<p>As the UK resigned itself to life under lockdown, Alyson Gibbons felt her world was falling apart.

The group includes a high proportion of older men with an African-Caribbean background from London boroughs that have been heavily hit by Covid-19. Since the lockdown began the group has met over Zoom. \u201cI was pleasantly surprised with how many were already familiar with the technology, given that the group\u2019s average age is probably mid-60s. We\u2019ve also taught others who were not so familiar how to use it, so that no one is left out,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Being cooped up and unable to see loved ones has made the body blow of cancer harder for many. Vicki Day, 58,<strong> </strong>from Lytham St Annes in Lancashire, learned that she had throat cancer in late January and had her radiotherapy mask made and fitted with her father and daughter beside her<strong> </strong>just before lockdown.<strong> </strong>A week later she began her hospital treatment alone. \u201cUnder normal circumstances my father would have spent every day eating cake and reading magazines in the coffee shop and my daughter would have been with me,\u201d she says. \u201cSitting in the wheelchair and being sick and desperately needing someone was just crushing ... it would have made a huge difference having my daughter ask questions at the weekly reviews. My mind went blank and I just wanted my bed.\u201d</p> <p>Some cancer charities say they are worried that lockdown will exacerbate anxiety. The Teenage Cancer Trust (TCT), which has <a href=\"https://www.teenagecancertrust.org/about-us/what-we-do/cancer-units\">28 dedicated units</a> in primary treatment centres for cancer, says that large numbers of young people have told the charity that they\u2019ve found it really tough not being able to see friends and family or continue to work. Although the charity provides digital support and activities, it has had to suspend face-to-face activities. These \u201cprovide important psychological support, and we\u2019re worried about the toll this [lack of in-person meetings] will take on young people\u2019s mental health longer-term,\u201d says Kate Collins, TCT\u2019s chief executive.</p> <p>For others, coronavirus has halted their tentative steps back to a normal life.<strong> </strong>Anna Robertson, 38, was on a phased return to work following breast cancer treatment when the pandemic sent her plans into reverse.

Colette Cowan, head of service delivery at Wessex, says: \u201cWe have seen an increase in demand for our services, both from existing and new clients. We\u2019ve seen an increase in clients wanting connection with others. Cancer diagnoses haven\u2019t stopped during Covid-19 and those people have been seeking support through our telephone and remote services. We\u2019ve also had a huge increase in the number of family members seeking support on behalf of a loved one who has been isolated and struggling.\u201d</p> <p>And demand for support is likely to rise still further after the pandemic. Analysis by Cancer Research UK suggests that as Covid-19 deaths increased, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jun/01/millions-in-uk-miss-cancer-screenings-tests-and-treatments-due-to-covid-19\">millions of people have not been screened and 24,000 cases have gone undiagnosed</a>.

Caroline Hoffman is the clinical and research director at <a href=\"https://www.breastcancerhaven.org.uk/\">Breast Cancer Haven</a>, which has compressed five regional centres into one virtual operation, yet has seen participation in its support groups rise by a third after switching to Zoom. She says, of coming out of lockdown, \u201cI\u2019d like to think that we can develop our live online services to expand to a wider area, but also keep some face-to-face presence.\u201d</p> <p>Maggie\u2019s has already reopened for one-to-one appointments and plans to restart work in small groups, as soon as it is safe to do so. Others are more cautious. Chris Curtis, chief executive of The Swallows, a head and neck cancer support group, says: \u201cWe can\u2019t look to restart face-to-face meetings until the new year, due to the current lockdown restrictions and because the people we support are highly vulnerable.\u201d</p> <p>Back in Chandler\u2019s Ford<strong>,</strong> Gibbons is clear that even after lockdown, her life has changed. \u201cWhen coronavirus goes, life isn\u2019t going to be all rosy, and we\u2019re back to normal,\u201d she says. Although she looks forward to her virtual catch-ups and counselling, she dislikes the \u201cwhispery\u201d necessity of checking that her children are out of earshot.

  "<p>To this day, the notoriety that precedes Heaven\u2019s Gate is as outsized as the film\u2019s 216-minute runtime: as the largest critical and commercial flop of its era, its disastrous reception was a major factor in the shuttering of its studio, United Artists, as well as a convenient scapegoat for the death of the New Hollywood revolution that preceded it.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet, 40 years after its initial release, Michael Cimino\u2019s magnum opus has undergone a remarkable critical reappraisal. Once the posterchild for auteurist hubris, it slowly built a cult following before eventually being welcomed into the arthouse canon proper. While some continue to hold it up as one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/mar/21/1\">the worst movies ever made</a> (a preposterous claim even when accounting for all its collateral damage), it is now generally regarded an unjustly maligned \u2013 if flawed \u2013 classic.</p> <p>This heady mix of infamy and acclaim, of which I\u2019ve been cognisant since my teens thanks to the film\u2019s prominence in the cinema docs A Decade Under the Influence, Easy Riders, Raging Bulls and Z-Channel: A Magnificent Obsession, combined with the aforementioned lengthy runtime, always made the prospect of actually watching the film rather intimidating. For years, I\u2019ve put it off by using the convenient excuse that I was waiting for a theatrical screening in order to \u201csee it the way it was meant to be seen\u201d. Since that\u2019s not on the cards at the moment, I figured it was finally time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"015c9ece1b96ff5a838f461366f7a3620b6f8eed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/015c9ece1b96ff5a838f461366f7a3620b6f8eed/0_150_1825_1095/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christopher Walken in Heaven\u2019s Gate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christopher Walken as conscience stricken gun-thug Nate Champion in Heaven\u2019s Gate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Intimidated though I was, I was also excited, since I have a deep and abiding love of all things New Hollywood, as well as westerns and Lean/Leone-sized epics. I might have popped my Cimino cherry with The Deer Hunter and still scratched two out of three of those itches, but I believe the best entrance to a formidable artist\u2019s body of work is through their most challenging efforts: my first Fellini was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/15/fellinis-eight-and-a-half-masterpiece-cinemas-dreamer\">8\u00bd</a>, my first Tarkovsky was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/apr/08/andrei-tarkovsky-stalker-japan-fukushima-nuclear\">Stalker</a>, my first Lynch was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jun/20/david-lynch-films-five-best-moments-mulholland-drive-elephant-eraserhead\">Lost Highway</a>. Therefore, I reasoned, my first Cimino should be Heaven\u2019s Gate.</p> <p>My theory proved correct.</p> <p>Heaven\u2019s Gate opens with a long graduation ceremony at Harvard University in the year 1869. We\u2019re introduced to Jim Averill (Kris Kristofferson), a rakish young upstart who clearly comes from wealth (his spirited optimism and lust for life make it very obvious that, despite being of fighting age, he managed to avoid the recently concluded civil war). There\u2019s also his loquacious boozehound buddy, Billy Irvine (John Hurt), and angelic girlfriend and soon-to-be wife, a silent and nameless cipher whose haunting presence bookends the film while bringing its grand theme \u2013 that we\u2019re each of us victims of the our class \u2013 into sharp and troubling relief.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d01b67d61b91d3e79829f45da988683039cbdb4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d01b67d61b91d3e79829f45da988683039cbdb4f/0_245_2230_1338/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heaven\u2019s Gate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wild Wyoming \u2026 Heaven\u2019s Gate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Following this prologue, we are shuttled 20 years into the future and deposited in Wyoming. There we find a much-changed Averill serving as sheriff of Johnson County, a fertile farmland where a bloody range war is being waged between poor and starving immigrant farmers \u2013 most of them newly arrived from Europe \u2013 and the Wyoming Stock Growers Association, a cooperative made up of the state\u2019s richest cattle barons (including a reluctant, but concessive Billy). On his return to Johnson County, Averill learns that the association has drawn up a death list of 125 names (almost every immigrant in the county) and arranged to bring in an army of mercenaries to carry out executions.&nbsp;</p> <p>Despite his own privileged background, Averill \u2013 who has found himself entangled in a tense love triangle with the beautiful French-Canadian madam Ella Watson (Isabelle Huppert) and his former friend Nate Champion (Christopher Walken), a local farm boy turned conscience stricken gun-thug \u2013 vows to protect his adopted community against the association\u2019s murderous machinations. Given that this is a typically cynical and despairing 70s movie (one based on a real-life atrocity), it\u2019s not much of a spoiler to reveal his efforts are all for naught, the ratcheting violence of this war of attrition eventually leading to a full-scale massacre \u2013 one of many on which this nation was built. Suffice to say, Heaven\u2019s Gate made for appropriate, if untraditional, Memorial Day viewing.</p> <p>For all that I expected Heaven\u2019s Gate to be a sprawling epic in the vein of One-Eyed Jack and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, it proved remarkably straightforward in its plot and focus. While the most memorable scenes are drawn-out set pieces \u2013 the opening graduation ceremony, a rollicking wheel-skate dance derby, the climactic battle \u2013 its sense of sprawl comes mostly through prolonged moments of quiet intimacy between a handful of characters. These scenes go a long way towards imbuing the film with its funereal feel, although they also come at the expense of some dearly needed character backstory and narrative connective tissue.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"31b37d7f182d81a6c91642d462c5b2a3a55ea571\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31b37d7f182d81a6c91642d462c5b2a3a55ea571/0_33_1407_1759/800.jpg\" alt=\"The Ayatollah \u2026 aka Michael Cimino in 1979.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Ayatollah \u2026 AKA Michael Cimino in 1979.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edwin Reichert/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Say what you will about Cimino\u2019s storied megalomaniacal obsessiveness and authoritarian tendencies (his on-set nickname was The Ayatollah), he truly left it all up there on screen. Aesthetically speaking, Heaven\u2019s Gate is unimpeachable, from the lived-in period detail of the costumes and set design, to the stunning cinematography \u2013 by turns ethereal and earthen \u2013 courtesy of the legendary Vilmos Zsigmond, to the soulful work of its leads (particularly Kristofferson, who never gets the credit he deserves as one of his era\u2019s greatest movie stars). There is also a ridiculously stacked supporting cast (including Jeff Bridges, Sam Waterston, Brad Dourif, Mickey Rourke, Terry O\u2019Quinn, Geoffrey Lewis, Tom Noonan, Robin Bartlett, Joseph Cotten and an uncredited, blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-him Willem Dafoe).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/01/heavens-gate-review\">Heaven's Gate \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The film maintains a clear moral vision without seeming reductive \u2013 a charge that was levelled at Cimino\u2019s Vietnam epic, The Deer Hunter. Particularly effective is the way in which Heaven\u2019s Gate unequivocally sides with its immigrant underclass without reducing them to paragons of noble victimhood. All that said, the film lacks the full cathartic power and thematic complexity of successive works that it seemingly inspired, such as John Sayles\u2019 sterling coal war drama Matewan and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/02/how-deadwood-went-from-eye-popping-tv-to-a-parade-of-old-hams\">HBO\u2019s radical revisionist western Deadwood</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>That my biggest criticism of the film is that it\u2019s not quite as good as those two utter masterpieces should make it clear that I am now a full-on pro-Heaven\u2019s Gate partisan.&nbsp;</p> <p>As such, I was tempted to argue that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/01/heavens-gate-review\">Heaven\u2019s Gate</a> should now be considered purely on its merits as a film, rather than its cultural baggage. But the more I think about it, the more I realise said baggage adds to its overall power. It\u2019s entirely fitting \u2013 poetic even \u2013 that the cinematic revolution of the 1970s should kick off with a handful of small films about scrappy rebels traversing a rugged landscape in search of the American dream, only for it to buckle and collapse under the weight of this towering ode to defeat and the destructive folly of manifest destiny and westward expansion.</p>",

Some Titirangi residents have said on social media that the chickens bring a quaint and charming character to the village. Others say they\u2019re \u201clike something out of a Stephen King movie\u201d.</p> <p>Presland, who said \u201cabout 15\u201d of the birds have taken up residence 50 metres from his house, said the problem began in 2008 when a resident had released two domesticated chickens in the village and they had \u201cgone rogue.\u201d</p> <p>The flock\u2019s numbers swelled in the years since, peaking at as many as 250 in 2019.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cA combination of being sleep deprived and seeing the neighbourhood wrecked made some people really hate them,\u201d said Presland, adding that the chickens had also harmed the roots of kauri trees, an endangered New Zealand native.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the last straw came when the suburb was \u201cterrorised\u201d by a pestilence of rats \u201cthe size of cats\u201d, he said, which were attracted by food left out for the birds. Residents were finally united: the chickens had to go.&nbsp;</p> <p>Council contractors set up large nets in different parts of the village, rounding up about 230 of the birds.</p> <p>\u201cIt was an extremely difficult technique because residents wanted to get rid of them but not to harm them,\u201d Presland said. A vet was even on standby to check the chickens and ensure they were well cared-for.</p> <p>\u201cThen we would send them off to this farm to live happily ever after,\u201d he added.</p> <p>After the chicken capture operation, fewer than 10 remained, with eight more rounded up before the country was locked down to curb the spread of Covid-19 in late March. That left about two especially wily birds, which proved resistant to capture, at large.&nbsp;</p> <p>Attempts to track them down were suspended during the lockdown, and when the residents of Titirangi emerged from the shutdown, the chickens were back in force.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a very kind-hearted local who feeds them and has kept feeding them so the numbers have started to spike up again,\u201d Presland said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re convinced that there\u2019s been at least two dumping episodes, where someone\u2019s got their chickens and just dumped them in the village.\u201d</p> <p>Efforts to capture the birds will now redouble, although some exasperated locals had suggested they instead be sent to a local frozen chicken company.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe thought\u2019s actually starting to appeal,\u201d Presland said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Eradication of the birds from Titirangi \u201cwould be ideal\u201d he said.

But the markets, driven by Wall Street as usual, seem to think that the worst is over.</p> <h2>So what happened?</h2> <p>By the second week of March the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, had seen enough. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/12/us-and-european-markets-plunge-further-after-trump-travel-ban\">It decided to pump $1.5tn dollars into the financial system</a>, consisting of buying up government bonds that no one else wanted to buy, direct loans worth billions to struggling companies and also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/23/the-fed-is-running-out-of-options-to-stave-off-a-coronavirus-depression\">circumventing legislation to hoover up the debt of risky companies as well</a>. The policy driven through by Fed chairman Jerome Powell paved the way for massive intervention from other central banks across the world, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/emergency-stimulus-explained-what-the-rba-and-government-are-doing-to-boost-australias-economy\">such as in Australia</a>, where the Reserve Bank embarked on quantitative easing \u2013 or money printing \u2013 for the first time. These measures have basically saved the day, along with huge fiscal stimulus from governments including state-funded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/may/12/how-the-uk-furlough-scheme-compares-with-other-countries\">wages schemes for furloughed workers, </a>such as in the UK.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/johnauthers/status/1268410500276195329\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There&#39;s an old lesson in this stock market rally: Follow the money.

The post-Lehman intervention was massive and paved the way for a decade-long boom but it continued the cycle of reliance on debt and we never really weaned ourselves off it. This current market intervention is even bigger and risks extending what many experts saw as an unsustainable cycle. It has essentially underwritten risk in the markets and investors have seen this as a sign that governments will do whatever it takes to prevent large falls in the stock markets \u2013 a kind of proto-nationalisation of the global economy. Hence money has poured back into stocks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-crisis-could-lead-to-new-credit-crunch-as-companies-struggle-with-debt\">despite many companies being on their knees</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/global-report-asian-markets-at-three-month-high-on-hope-of-covid-19-recovery\">Global report: Asian markets at three-month high on hope of Covid-19 recovery</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Angus Coote of Jamieson Coote Bonds in Melbourne said metrics used by analysts such as the earnings per share of companies showed that money had flowed into indebted companies, indicating that the current wave of investment was especially risky. He warned that the mistakes of the post-2008 response were being repeated and that ordinary working people would end up bearing the costs. \u201cIt\u2019s quite sickening to see Mr Powell bail out Wall Street types at the expense of the man on the street,\u201d he said. \u201cSocialise the losses, privatise the gains. It\u2019s not capitalism.\u201d </p> <h2>So we are in danger of inflating another bubble here?</h2> <p>That is a possibility because so much new money has been created \u2013 only last week the eurozone <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/jun/04/covid-19-uk-car-sales-aston-martin-lookers-ecb-christine-lagarde-interest-rate-sterling-dollar-euro-business-live?page=with:block-5ed8e1118f082107f453aa6e#block-5ed8e1118f082107f453aa6e\">doubled its support measures </a>to \u20ac1.35tn \u2013 and it has to go somewhere. The feeling among experts is that if it is put to productive use, such as in infrastructure spending, or channelled into the pockets of people on low incomes who will spend the money in shops and on services, then the real economy might be rebooted on a more sustainable footing. But if it is simply passed to investors to inflate the prices of assets such as shares and property, knowing that the Fed will support the market if it turns sour, then we have simply doubled down on the problem.</p> <p>Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser of the insurance giant Allianz, says massive Fed support was not just propping up unproductive \u201czombie companies\u201d but risks creating \u201czombie markets\u201d which are so distorted that capital is not used properly. \u201cIt also adds to the disconnect between Main Street and Wall Street [and] worsens wealth inequality,\u201d he says. Damien Klassen of Nucleus Wealth in Melbourne says the feeling that investors could not lose is stacked with risk and moral hazard. \u201cIt\u2019s OK if the money created by central banks goes into productive things like infrastructure but it has no value if it goes into bidding up asset prices. That\u2019s where the moral hazard comes in and that is where we risk inflating another bubble.\u201d</p> <h2>But what about the recession we\u2019ve heard so much about?</h2> <p>Good point. Just about every major economy is already in recession or is heading that way at a rate of knots. The World Bank said on Tuesday that its baseline forecast envisions that the world economy will shrink by 5.2% this year, the deepest global recession in decades. The current quarter is expected to be the worst but we won\u2019t know how bad until later in the year, by which time unemployment will be peaking at well over 10% in many countries. On top of that, we don\u2019t know what will happen when governments start to phase out the wage furlough schemes and people are left potentially without incomes.</p> <h2>So it might get worse again?</h2> <p>That\u2019s a strong possibility because the current action on stock markets appears to be totally disconnected from the real world economy. \u201cAt the moment traders are thinking that this is as bad as it gets and it will get better,\u201d says Klassen. \u201cBut they might have to start looking at the fundamentals at some point. They think it looks OK now but it doesn\u2019t take into account the demand destruction or supply chain disruption that we\u2019ve seen and that has to be rebuilt. Small and medium-sized business losses and job losses might become so great that the market can\u2019t ignore it.\u201d</p>",

Coercion, both threats and actual punishment, will be an enduring feature of Australia\u2019s relationship with China. Even if the threats are not necessarily planned, or the costs ultimately minimal, the relationship between Australia and China has declined to the point that&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theasanforum.org/chinese-economic-coercion-during-the-thaad-dispute/\">any shift is interpreted through a negative lens</a>: there is so much smoke, everything looks like it is on fire.&nbsp;</p> <p>China has been telegraphing its geostrategic goals for decades, and now has increased capacity and confidence in acting on those ambitions. China today \u2013 more authoritarian and ideological under president Xi Jinping \u2013 is increasingly willing to force international compliance through the use of coercive statecraft. The logic of Xi\u2019s China, coupled with growing internal pressure and expanding interests abroad, can only mean more conflicts will arise with more countries.&nbsp;</p> <p>Australian interests and values regularly clash with China\u2019s foreign and domestic behaviour, as they have in the past. Australia is not unique in this respect: France, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and the Czech Republic are just some of the countries that have been embroiled&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/france-summons-chinese-envoy-after-coronavirus-slur\">in conflict with Chinese diplomats</a>&nbsp;in recent weeks.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>China today is increasingly willing to force international compliance through the use of coercive statecraft</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A renewed focus on the factors within Australia\u2019s control is warranted. Calls for trade diversification will not change China\u2019s position as our largest trading partner in the medium-term. There can be adjustments around the edges \u2013 and this might be prudent in some sectors \u2013 but Australia and China\u2019s economic relationship was built on complementarity, not charity.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s mindset needs to adjust to this new reality. At present, we have fallen into a predictable and stagnant cycle, where Beijing demands Australia \u201cfix things\u201d \u2013 code for conceding to the Chinese Communist party\u2019s demands \u2013 and Canberra is then criticised for mismanaging the relationship. More often than not, China may not expect the decision to be reversed, but intends to deter Australia \u2013 or any other government \u2013 from crossing it in the future.&nbsp;</p> <p>Instead, it would be to our benefit if political leaders, bureaucrats and business leaders alike had a level of sangfroid about threats from China as they become regular fixtures in Australia\u2019s future. This will be understandably harder for business facing real losses than for politicians, but taking account of political risks is not new. Government agencies can support China-focused businesses to prepare for these risks and mitigate the fallout. Better coordination will be needed between federal and state governments.&nbsp;</p> <p>Understanding China\u2019s willingness and reasons for using economic coercion in the past and against other countries provides a useful baseline to raise awareness and put the consequences in context.&nbsp;</p> <p>First, Australia is not alone \u2013 recent history is replete with examples: South Korea in 2017, the Philippines and Japan in 2012 and Norway from 2010 to 2017. Some industries were hard hit but in no case was an economy brought to its knees. The logic of markets eventually saw the resumption of more normal commercial ties.</p> <p>Second, we should expect Beijing to lash out more and more often. China is a rising power with expanding interests. These will increasingly clash with others, and growing internal pressures are placing the Communist party leadership under greater strain. More disputes will arise with more countries.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/09/chinese-china-investment-in-australia-plunges-almost-60-to-lowest-level-since-2007\">Chinese investment in Australia plunges almost 60% to lowest level since 2007</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fostering resilience is more than a level of trade diversification. Partly it involves resisting the Chinese party-state\u2019s behaviour on our territory, such as protecting Australian institutions from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/29/sweeping-foreign-interference-and-spying-laws-pass-senate\">undue influence</a>.

It also matters for our prosperity: the calls for Australia to diversify and decouple will only become louder. At a certain point, these calls become a self-fulfilling prophecy. In the annual&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lowyinstitutepoll.lowyinstitute.org/charts/china-attitudes-towards-china\">Lowy Institute poll</a>, three-quarters of Australians say we are too economically dependent on China. The same number say Australia does not pressure China enough to improve human rights. Trust in China has reached&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lowyinstitutepoll.lowyinstitute.org/themes/china/\">record lows</a>.</p> <p>Arguing to prioritise domestic resilience is not to hit pause on diplomacy. Australia can and should remind China of the importance of preserving freedoms in Hong Kong. While encouraging better treatment and release of Australian citizens in China, we should condemn human rights violations in Xinjiang and elsewhere because our morals and our public demand it.&nbsp;</p> <p>Resilience is also a mindset. We may be punished for staying true to our values, and we should be prepared \u2013 psychologically, as well as pragmatically. It goes without saying we should not compromise on our fundamental beliefs. But more attention is needed on the factors that are wholly within our control. Beijing may be immune to our condemnation of its coercive tactics, but the resilience of Australia\u2019s liberal democratic institutions and expert industries is in our hands.</p> <p>\u2022&nbsp;Natasha Kassam is a research fellow at the Lowy Institute.

Ordinarily, his family would have had 30 days to claim his body and confirm funeral arrangements. But on 13 March, Sala introduced a measure reducing the timeframe to five days, owing to the escalation in deaths, overburdened morgues and requirement to bury victims of infectious disease quickly.&nbsp;</p> <p>Domeniconi\u2019s wife and two children were told about his death, and had left their contact details with the hospital\u2019s mortuary. All three then became ill with the virus. It wasn\u2019t until 20 March, when they called Milan\u2019s civic morgue, where Domeniconi\u2019s body had been moved, to make arrangements for his cremation and ashes to be taken to the family chapel in another Lombardy town, that they discovered he was about to be buried in Campo 87.</p> <p>\u201cThey called several public offices to try and stop it but were told it was not possible as the process was already advanced,\u201d said Marini. \u201cI\u2019ve written several emails to Milan\u2019s council to at least try to resolve the two-year situation, but was denied an appointment.\u201d</p> <p>Three other families are so far known to be in a similar situation, according to an investigation by <em><a href=\"https://milano.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/20_maggio_22/gianni-fossati-manager-milanese-dirigente-sepolto-campo-87-cimitero-maggiore-salme-senza-famiglia-9b6a8308-9c5e-11ea-aab2-c1d41bfb67c5.shtml\">Corriere della Sera</a></em>. Gianni Fossati, a well-known businessman, died in hospital on 24 March and was buried at Campo 87 despite leaving a wife, who was recovering from the virus in the same hospital at the time of his death, and a brother, Vando, who also lives in Milan.</p> <p>Vando learned of his brother\u2019s death through acquaintances, and like many other families who lost loved ones amid the chaos of the emergency, he had to go in search of his brother\u2019s body. With the help of a Milan councillor, Lorenzo Lipparini, also a family friend, he eventually discovered that Fossati had been buried in Campo 87 on 4 April.</p> <p>\u201cI can only imagine what was happening at the time in the hospitals. They were overwhelmed, with insufficient staff, and may have only done a cursory search for family,\u201d said Lipparini. \u201cThe council did the burials based on information that the bodies were unclaimed.\u201d</p> <p>A combination of the pressure in hospitals and relatives either falling ill or in lockdown outside Milan contributed to the erroneous burials.</p> <p>\u201cHospitals did try to trace relatives, but maybe staff didn\u2019t have time to make 100 calls,\u201d said Roberta Cocco, Milan\u2019s councillor for civic services. \u201cIn many cases, the five-day rule was surpassed to give more time for families to come forward.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44f6b2ccef69fb81084d3671184916bbec2824f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44f6b2ccef69fb81084d3671184916bbec2824f8/0_92_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Local police at the Campo 87 section\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Local police at the Campo 87 section.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paolo Salmoirago/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The cost of the burials at Campo 87, which has enough space for 680 graves, was paid for by Milan authorities and, in the event of an exhumation, Cocco said the council would also pay the bill.</p> <p>An office has been set up to help deal with families with relatives at Campo 87, but the possibility of retrieving the remains before two years is slim.</p> <p>\u201cIt is very difficult and we don\u2019t have a magic wand,\u201d said Cocco. \u201cThe law says that in the situation of an epidemic exhumations can\u2019t be done as there is the possibility of infection. All we can do is be close to families and guarantee their relatives a dignified burial.\u201d</p> <p>The council plans for the area to eventually be covered with grass and for each grave to have a marble tombstone.</p> <p>\u201cWe are thinking about how this space could become a memorial site for this terrible tragedy,\u201d said Cocco. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a graveyard for the abandoned \u2013 it is a graveyard for those who in that moment didn\u2019t have family or close people who could take care of the burial.\u201d</p> <p>But the tribute is unlikely to bring comfort to grieving families wanting to give their loved ones a funeral.</p> <p>\u201cMy clients do not want to make a lawsuit against the council \u2013 that is not the point \u2013 they just want to be able to retrieve the body.

Community safety does not come from cops \u2013 strong institutions ensure communities can thrive.</em></li> \n    <li><em>Support organizations led by, serving and in service to Black people. Support those who organize, agitate, resist, disrupt, demonstrate and advocate to ensure that Black lives are not expendable. The people have the power \u2013 fund organized action.</em></li> \n    <li><em>Interrogate what being an ally truly means. Use your voice. Be bold and take a stand: equivocation fuels inequity. If you have privilege, use it, leverage it. There is nothing revolutionary about recognizing your power and doing nothing with it to advance social change and end systemic racism.</em></li> \n    <li><em>You are either for Black lives or you are not. Systemic racism permeates every system \u2013 law enforcement, education, health, transportation, housing, the economy, the environment and even philanthropy, the system in which I work. Are you hiring Black people? Are they tokenized or in leadership positions? It\u2019s not complicated. Oppression is operational. Disassemble it and undo the status quo.</em></li> \n    <li><em>Stop tiptoeing around race, slavery, racial injustice, racial bias, systemic racism, white supremacy, nationalism, anti-Blackness or racial equity. It\u2019s real. We\u2019ve studied and debated it long enough. Act. End of discussion.</em></li> \n    <li><em>Vote for an agenda at the local, state and federal levels that prioritizes Black lives and demolishes the insidious pillars of white supremacy in every form. For those whose electoral existence is predicated upon the domination of Black lives, we must dominate the ballot box. If you are registered to vote and someone you know is not, help them register.
