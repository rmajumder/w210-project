Welby also said the UK government must not make the mistake of focusing its efforts to mitigate the outbreak\u2019s economic effects on the UK\u2019s big cities at the expense of smaller communities.</p> <h2>UK to double military response force</h2> <p>The British army <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-live-news-updates-outbreak-us-states-uk-australia-europe-eu-self-isolation-lockdown-latest-update?page=with:block-5e72a4798f085e564ad86c27#block-5e72a4798f085e564ad86c27\">will significantly increase</a> the number of personnel available to help deal with the outbreak.

Morrison said he would hold further discussions with the independent and Catholic sectors.</p> <p>After those discussions, the Association of Independent Schools NSW chief executive Geoff Newcombe wrote to schools reiterating that it \u201csupports his position and that of the chief medical officer, that schools remain open for the present\u201d.</p> <p>Newcombe noted that attendance is down by as much as 30% in some schools and that Morrison had acknowledged \u201cour schools are independent\u201d.</p> <p>But he said the prime minister had \u201cinsisted that all non-government schools keep campuses open to accommodate those students who wish to engage in at-school learning\u201d.</p> <p>On Wednesday the National Catholic Education Commission also strongly backed Morrison\u2019s position that schools should remain open, <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/catholic-schools-break-ranks-with-advice-and-call-for-closures-20200317-p54b20.html\">shutting down suggestions from parts of the NSW Catholic system</a> that closures should be introduced as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>The NCEC executive director, Jacinta Collins, said: \u201cWhile there is significant concern and debate regarding school closures in Australia to minimise the spread of Covid-19 \u2026 it is our view that the government and public health authorities are in the best position to determine whether schools should remain open and we will adhere to this advice.</p> <p>\u201cI appreciate that, despite this advice some parents have chosen to keep their children at home, or have special circumstances to consider,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, Catholic schools will remain open and operational until we have been advised otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>Although the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/why-australia-is-not-shutting-schools-to-help-control-the-spread-of-coronavirus\">recommended that schools remain open</a>, Labor is concerned that the government appears to be keeping them open, in part, to ensure essential service workers like doctors and nurses can continue to go to work.</p> <p>The shadow health minister, Chris Bowen, said the government should explain \u201cwhat the trigger point might be for school closures\u201d and \u201cprepare now for health workers\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s not use the fact that health workers who have their kids in school as a reason not to close schools if that becomes the right decision,\u201d he told reporters in Sydney.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s plan now to provide the support for health workers.</p> <p>\u201cIn Norway, the schools are closed but there is a skeleton teaching staff left in the schools for health workers, the kids of health workers so they can still go to work.\u201d</p> <p>In her letter, Plibersek called for \u201csupport for parents who are unable to attend work in the event of extended closures\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIn particular, ensuring arrangements are in place so that health and other essential services workers don\u2019t have to leave work and grandparents and other older relatives aren\u2019t put at risk providing child care.\u201d</p> <p>Plibersek also made a range of demands including:</p> <ul> <li><p>Ensuring all schools have access to adequate sanitation facilities.</p></li> <li><p>Making sure online learning options are available.</p></li> <li><p>Support for at-risk children and families.</p></li> <li><p>Extra measures to ensure the health and safety of teachers and other school staff.</p></li> <li><p>Special consideration arrangements to make sure school closures don\u2019t unfairly affect a student\u2019s marks, especially in Year 12.</p></li> </ul> <p>\u201cI have been contacted by a number of parents concerned that lack of soap or spring-loaded taps in bathrooms at their children\u2019s school undermines good hygiene.\u201d</p> <p>On Wednesday the Australian Medical

  "<p>Private tenants will not be evicted from their homes for at least three months even if struggling with their rent under emergency coronavirus legislation announced by the housing secretary.</p> \n<p>Robert Jenrick said new laws would ban landlords in England and Wales from evicting tenants, following days of pressure by campaigners and tenants\u2019 unions who had warned that tens of thousands of households could be made homeless because they could not afford rent.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cEmergency legislation will be taken forward as an urgent priority so that landlords will not be able to start proceedings to evict tenants for at least a three-month period.\u201d<br><br>If that legislation goes through soon, renters will be able to rest easy until the middle of June, but the reprieve may only defer difficulties with landlords and evictions.

Otherwise the end of the coronavirus crisis could mean the beginning of an evictions crisis.\u201d</p> \n<p>The moves followed confirmation from social landlords that they would not evict tenants who were struggling with payments. Kate Henderson, chief executive of the National Housing Federation, said: \u201cNo one should be evicted because of the coronavirus.

We have called on industry to rapidly develop this test,\u201d said the DHSC statement.</p> <p>Europe, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/13/who-director-general-europe-centre-coronavirus-pandemic-video\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/13/who-director-general-europe-centre-coronavirus-pandemic-video\">Covid-19 pandemic is growing fastest</a>, is generally not attempting to hunt down the virus by embracing tests and contact tracing in the way that China, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan have done, to the concern of the WHO.</p> <p>Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO\u2019s director general, has again called on every country to adopt its recommended strategy.</p> <p>The only way to slow the pandemic sufficiently to give time for treatments and a vaccine to become available is to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/who-urges-countries-to-track-and-trace-every-covid-19-case\">test everyone who has symptoms and track and isolate their contacts</a>, he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Social distancing measures help, \u201cbut to suppress the epidemic, countries must isolate, test, treat and trace,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t, transmission chains can continue at a lower level and then resurge once physical distancing [is] lifted.\u201d</p> <p>Testing, contact tracing and isolating those people with the virus or suspected of having it \u201cmust be the backbone of the response in every country. This is the best hope of preventing widespread country transmission,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Countries where the epidemic is taking off should not give up on testing and contact tracing. He cited South Korea, which was reporting 800 cases a day and is now down to 90. \u201cA few months ago the Republic of Korea was faced with accelerating community transmission, but it didn\u2019t surrender,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Since the outbreak began, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/covid-19-south-koreans-keep-calm-and-carry-on-testing\">South Korea has tested more than 250,000 people</a>, and has the capacity to test 15,000 people a day. It has conducted 3,692 tests per million people, compared with five per million in the US.</p> <p>South Korea has also pioneered drive-through tests, which allow people to be tested without leaving their vehicles \u2013 a system that also means health workers do not have to disinfect the premises after each test.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/covid-19-south-koreans-keep-calm-and-carry-on-testing\">Covid-19: South Koreans keep calm and carry on testing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Smartphone alerts are sent out, informing people of an infected person\u2019s previous movements, which allows everyone to work out whether they might have been in contact and to get a test. That has sparked concerns about personal privacy, however, with the South Korean human rights commission advising health authorities to withhold personal information unless it is essential to containing the virus.</p> <p>Germany has the lowest mortality rate of the 10 countries with the most severe epidemics, at 0.3% compared to Italy\u2019s 7.9%. Christian Drosten, a virologist at Berlin\u2019s Charit\u00e9 hospital who advises the government, said one of the reasons may have to do with Germany\u2019s relatively high number of tests compared with other countries in Europe. Catching even mild cases of the Covid-19 infection in the overall figures would push down the rate of lethal cases.</p> <p>While Germany has not tested its citizens at the same high rate as South Korea, guidelines have been in place for over a month for people to be tested if they show the usual symptoms and have either had contact with an infected person or recently visited a \u201chigh-risk area\u201d such as Lombardy or Wuhan.</p> <p>According to Germany\u2019s National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians, the country has the capacity to conduct about 12,000 Covid-19 tests per day.</p> <p>\u201cOur laboratories are technically very well equipped,\u201d said Drosten, \u201cour regulations for the introduction of new test procedures are very flexible and our statutory health insurance association already introduced a code for these tests in January, which means that [insurers] are financially supported.\u201d</p> <p>Italy, which reported its highest daily coronavirus death toll of 475 on Wednesday, has zero cases in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/scientists-say-mass-tests-in-italian-town-have-halted-covid-19\">the small town of Vo\u2019 in the Veneto region</a>, which tested the entire population after it suffered the first coronavirus death in Italy. Medical experts and governors and mayors around the country have been pushing to carry out mass tests, including people who are asymptomatic.</p> <p>\u201cA test does no harm to anyone,\u201d said Luca Zaia, the governor of Veneto, who is now taking action to test every single inhabitant of the region, \u201cno matter how much it will cost\u201d.</p> <p>Vo\u2019 is now \u201cthe healthiest place in Italy\u201d, he said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is proof that the testing system works. Here there were the first two cases. We tested everyone, even if the \u2018experts\u2019 told us this was a mistake: 3,000 tests. We found 66 positives, who we isolated for 14 days, and after that six of them were still positive. And that is how we ended it.\u201d</p> <p>Not everyone believes the experience of a small town will work on a large scale. Massimo Galli, director of infectious diseases at the Luigi Sacco hospital in Milan, told the Guardian that carrying out mass tests on the asymptomatic population could prove to be useless.</p> <p>\u201cThe contagions are unfortunately constantly evolving,\u201d Galli said. \u201cA man who tests negative today could contract the disease tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>France has the capacity to do just 2,500 tests a day and is prioritising healthcare professionals, those who are severely ill, the vulnerable and people in care homes. In the US, public health experts have been raising serious concerns about the unavailability of testing. In a four-day period from 8 March to the morning of 11 March, only 77 people in the country were tested.</p> <p>Within the last few days, the US testing capacity has slowly started to increase. Earlier this month, the Centers for Disease Control said labs were conducting about 2,500 tests per day. On 16 March, the number rose to 8,200.</p>",

It\u2019s not <strong><em>just </em></strong>because the dollar is in massive demand. </p> <p>He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Sterling has completed one of its steepest declines in memory by hitting its weakest level since 1985, excluding if you will the brief dive of the Oct 2016 \u2018flash crash\u2019. </p> <p>This is the worst sustained period of sterling selling that I can recall, and it points to a severe dollar liquidity crunch that central banks have yet to get a grip on. There is a synchronised rush for dollars that has caught most companies, governments and traders on the hop. Dollar funding issues have been far more serious than estimated prior to this crisis.<br></p> <p>However sterling is also sharply weaker against the euro in recent days, with EURGBP above 0.92, so whilst the main reason for the pound\u2019s decline, there are clearly other factors at work. The UK government\u2019s massive fiscal package undoubtedly means more borrowing for the UK economy - how do we pay for all this? And in a rather bizarre turn of events - if you have been schooled in the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis a few years back - the euro has developed certain safe haven characteristics. Sterling is, on the other hand, a bit of a proxy for risk.<br></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6d9a6f877ef1ce814607886fb201720f53ac5e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6d9a6f877ef1ce814607886fb201720f53ac5e7/0_0_580_342/500.jpg\" alt=\"The pound vs the US dollar this year\" width=\"500\" height=\"295\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The pound vs the US dollar this year</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Refinitiv</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e720dd28f085c6327bc2310\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T12:04:18.508Z\">12.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A growing number of European carmakers are downing tools, my colleague Rob Davies reports:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>BMW and Toyota have joined a rapidly lengthening list of carmakers shutting down European operations, affecting UK plants in Oxfordshire and Derbyshire, as the coronavirus brings the automotive industry grinding to a virtual halt.</p> <p>More than 10,000 car workers have been laid off across the industry as Nissan, the Mercedes-Benz parent, Daimler, Volkswagen, Ford, Fiat and Peugeot have already announced suspensions of their European output.

In a four-day period from 8 March to the morning of 11 March, only 77 people in the country were tested.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-drive-through-testing-new-york-station-opening\">Coronavirus drive-through testing station to open in New York</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Within the last few days, however, the US testing capacity has slowly started to increase. Earlier this month, the CDC said labs were conducting about 2,500 tests <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/15/trump-administration-says-it-will-launch-mobile-coronavirus-test-system-this-week/\">per day</a>. On 16 March, the number <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/03/17/coronavirus-testing-us/\">rose</a> to 8,200. To put things into perspective, South Korea \u2013 which has been hailed for its rapid testing of its population that is about one-sixth of the US\u2019s \u2013 tests about 20,000 people a day.</p> <p>The uptick can be attributed to the ability of more labs to process tests and the rollout of equipment that makes processing quicker. Though the US is starting to see more tests being processed, Deborah Birx, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-dr-deborah-birx-hiv-aids\">top official</a> in the US team responding to coronavirus, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-2/\">warned</a> hospitals and labs on Sunday that there would be a \u201cpent-up demand\u201d for testing and advised that they stock up on their equipment.</p> <p>With this demand, it will probably be a while until testing is available for all those who are showing symptoms.</p> <h2><strong>Who is getting tested in the US?</strong></h2> <p>Decisions about who is getting tested are being made at the county and state level.</p> <p>Broadly, CDC guidelines to healthcare professionals say that those tested must be showing symptoms, and priority is given to those who are in hospital, are at risk for the virus\u2019s most deadly effects (elderly people and those with chronic medical conditions or weakened immune systems) or had known contact with a person who tested positive as priorities for testing. The CDC also says those who have a history of travel from \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/after-travel-precautions.html\">affected geographic areas</a>\u201d \u2013 China, Iran, South Korea and parts of Europe \u2013 should be prioritized.</p> <p>But there appears to be no guarantee of a test. Over the past few weeks, there has been a flood of stories of people who are symptomatic and should be prioritized by testing, but were not: for example, the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-17/wife-cpr-died-coronavirus-test\">elderly husband </a>of a coronavirus patient who died from the illness, <a href=\"https://khn.org/news/surging-health-care-worker-quarantines-raise-concerns-as-coronavirus-spreads/\">healthcare workers </a>who may have been exposed to the virus and countless numbers of symptomatic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/16/trump-coronavirus-test-covad-19-new-york\">travelers</a> to countries with known outbreaks. </p> <p>Those who have been tested have often described <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/nyregion/coronavirus-testing-positive.html\">frustrating</a> <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/03/who-gets-tested-coronavirus/607999/\">experiences</a> of being sent from one place to another seeking a test.</p> <p>Fueling the frustration are stories of high-profile figures who have managed to get tested. The NBA got 58 tests <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2020/03/13/how-utah-jazz-got-coronavirus-tests-during-national-shortage/5046539002/\">within six hours</a> for players of the Utah Jazz, though it is unclear how many players were actually showing symptoms. A fashion influencer who had body aches and a fever was <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemcneal/something-navy-influencer-arielle-charnas-coronavirus\">tested</a> with the help of a friend, after other doctors she spoke with told her she did not qualify for testing in New York state.</p> <h2><strong>Where are people being tested?</strong></h2> <p>The CDC <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/testing.html\">says</a> public health labs in all US states and most territories are currently processing tests.</p> <p>People who have been able to get a test have mostly been tested in hospitals and urgent care centers, but many places are now moving to mobile testing sites with the goal of making sure symptomatic people do not further spread the illness. Dozens of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/drive-through-coronavirus-tests-states-2020-3\">drive-through testing sites</a> have begun popping up across the country, though many require an appointment to be tested.</p> <p>The mobile sites are meant to be places where people can get samples taken \u2013 essentially a <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/03/16/coronavirus-what-expect-when-you-get-tested-covid-19/5061120002/\">swab</a> up the nose \u2013 and then their samples are taken to a lab for processing.</p> <h2><strong>What should a person do if they are showing symptoms?</strong></h2> <p>Broad recommendations from the CDC and local health department <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/testing.html\">recommend</a> calling a primary healthcare provider or the local health department if experiencing symptoms associated with the virus, such as fever and coughing. Those who experience severe symptoms such as chest pain and shortness of breath are advised to seek medical attention immediately.</p>",

On Monday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/16/boris-johnson-press-conference-coronavirus-live-firms-could-soon-be-allowed-to-run-reduced-services-because-of-coronavirus-shapps-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-5e6fb2518f085e564ad852d1#block-5e6fb2518f085e564ad852d1\">he told everyone to avoid all non-essential contact with other people. </a>On Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/17/boris-johnson-coronavirus-press-conference-rishi-sunak-cabinet-as-rishi-sunak-set-to-announcing-coronavirus-financial-rescue-package-politics-live?page=with:block-5e710eb58f088d757559530b#block-5e710eb58f088d757559530b\">he and his chancellor announced a \u00a3350bn rescue plan for business</a>. And today he said that schools in England were closing, for most pupils, for the foreseeable future.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said that schools in England would close for most pupils from Friday.</strong> And he refused to say how long the closures could last. (Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has said schools in Scotland might not reopen before the summer holidays.) He said there would be exceptions for the children of \u201ccritical workers\u201d and for vulnerable children, but he gave very little detail of who will qualify. He also said that pupils who missed out on this summer\u2019s GCSEs and A levels (also cancelled) would get the qualifications they needed for university, but he was not able to say how this would happen. Here is his opening statement on this.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can announce today and Gavin Williamson making statement now in House of Commons that after schools shut their gates from Friday afternoon, they will remain closed for most pupils \u2013 for the vast majority of pupils- until further notice. I will explain what I mean by the vast majority of pupils.</p> \n   <p>The objective is to slow the spread of the virus and we judge it is the right moment to do that.</p> \n   <p>But of course, as I\u2019ve always said, we also need to keep the NHS going and to treat the number of rising cases. So we need health workers who are also parents to continue to go to work. And we need other critical workers with children to keep doing their jobs too \u2013 from police officers who are keeping us safe to the supermarket delivery drivers, social care workers who look after the elderly and who are so vital. We will be setting out more details shortly about who we mean in these groups.</p> \n   <p>So we therefore need schools to make provision for the children of these key workers who would otherwise be forced to stay home. And they will also need to look after the most vulnerable children.</p> \n   <p>This will mean there will of course be are far fewer children in schools and that will help us to slow the spread of the disease. And these measures are crucial to make sure the critical parts of the economy keep functioning and public services keep functioning.</p> \n   <p>So we are simultaneously asking nurseries and private schools to do the same, and we are providing financial support where it is needed. We are making provisions to supply meals and vouchers for children eligible for free school meals. And where some schools are already doing this, I want to make it clear we will reimburse the cost. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson refused to rule out introducing tighter self-isolation rules for London</strong>. There have been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e8c98d1c-6926-11ea-a3c9-1fe6fedcca75\">reports claiming a virtual lock-down in the capital is planned for the weekend.</a>Johnson did nothing to play down these suggestions, and instead he repeatedly stressed his willingness to go \u201cfurther and faster\u201d. In response to one question on this, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019ve always said that we are going to do the right measures at the right time.</p> \n   <p>Actually I think a lot of people are taking a real heroic effort to comply with the advice we\u2019ve given but as I\u2019ve said tonight, and in the past few days, we keep everything under continuous review and we will not hesitate in bringing forward further and faster measures where we think that is necessary.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He implied that people ignoring the government advice given on Monday to limit social contact were putting lives at risk.</strong> He declined an invitation to call these people immoral. But, in response to the question, he used probably his strongest language to date on this theme. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Of course people must make their own decisions, I\u2019m a believer as I say in freedom. </p> \n   <p>But let\u2019s be absolutely in no doubt that these are very, very important choices that we are now making in our daily lives and the more closely and the more strictly, more ruthlessly, we can enforce upon ourselves, our families the advice we are getting, then the better we will be able to protect our NHS, the fewer deaths we will have and the less suffering there will be in the UK population. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said he had \u201cno intention\u201d of changing the law that rules out an extension of the Brexit transition. </strong>(See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough?page=with:block-5e725dda8f085c6327bc279b#block-5e725dda8f085c6327bc279b\"> 5.47pm.) </a>That is not the same as saying an extension will never happen, and his language will not dispel the widespread suspicions that an extension will now be inevitable.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He hinted that the government is planning bail-outs for struggling companies.</strong> (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough?page=with:block-5e725d268f088d7575595e99#block-5e725d268f088d7575595e99\"> 5.42pm.)</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"001b6fe86ac874f20cc292009a667699928178aa\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/001b6fe86ac874f20cc292009a667699928178aa/0_22_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson gestures during a news conference regarding the coronavirus, in Downing Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson gestures during a news conference regarding the coronavirus, in Downing Street.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eddie Mulholland/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7267018f085c6327bc2821\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T18:23:50.698Z\">6.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The government will introduce emergency legislation to ban evictions for three months to help protect renters, Sky News reports.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNewsBreak/status/1240339227646328833\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick says the Government will introduce emergency legislation to suspend new evictions from social or private rented accommodation \"during this national emergency\" amid the COVID-19 outbreak</p>\u2014 Sky News Breaking (@SkyNewsBreak) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNewsBreak/status/1240339227646328833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 18, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7261318f088d7575595edc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/richardadams\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T18:01:06.318Z\">6.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Education secretary <strong>Gavin Williamson</strong> told the Commons: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>After schools shut their gates on Friday afternoon they will remain closed until further notice this will be for all children, except to those of key workers and where children who are most vulnerable.</p> \n   <p>The scientific advice shows that the settings are safe for this small number of children to continue attending.

On Wednesday, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, told parliament: \u201cWe will be bringing forward legislation to protect private renters from eviction.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Shelter said that it has been contacted by one renter who works at an NHS hospital who said their landlord wanted to evict them and the other tenants in the property, some of whom also work at the hospital, because he fears contracting the virus from them. The landlord reportedly added that unless a cure in found in the next few weeks, they will have to leave.</p> \n  <p>Another renter was illegally evicted while on holiday in <strong>Italy</strong> without notice after the landlord said they were worried they would catch the virus. The tenant offered to self-isolate for 14 days elsewhere before returning to the property, but the landlord still refused, Shelter said. The cases emerged from the charity\u2019s online help service and could not be verified by the Guardian.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Tens of thousands of renters face being turfed out of their home in the next six months if the government fails to act quickly,\u201d said Polly Neate, chief executive at Shelter. \u201cWe need a wholesale and complete halt to all evictions while the coronavirus crisis unfolds. The government has stepped to in to support mortgagees and it must now act decisively to help renters survive the current storm. It must legislate immediately to halt all eviction proceedings during this period of social disruption.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Renters\u2019 organisation Generation Rent said almost two-thirds of renters have no savings, at least 2 million live in houses of multiple occupation putting them at higher risk of contracting the virus, and there are 1.1m self-employed heads of households who rent their homes, who are at a high risk of losing work as a result of coronavirus. </p> \n  <p>Caitlin Wilkinson, policy manager at the campaign group, said: <br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We know that many landlords will take action to evict tenants, leaving them homeless in the midst of a pandemic.

The tone was always going to serious and sombre given the nature of the crisis facing the country. (Every single question was about coronavirus, by my count.) But the effect of holding it in a near-empty chamber also made a difference because there was no cheering or barracking. Boris Johnson had no noise cushion to help him through. It meant that what he said mattered more.</p> \n  <p>Johnson was pressed repeatedly, especially by Jeremy Corbyn, by Ian Blackford and most effectively of all by Chris Byrant, on what he was doing to help workers who will lose out from coronavirus and he was on slightly shaky ground. Ministers insist they will announce a package of employment support measures very soon, and Johnson repeatedly insisted that people should not lose out for doing the right thing (ie, for staying at home, even if they feel well) and he repeatedly said that he was willing to do whatever it took. To some extent, that still sounded more like a slogan than a strategy.</p> \n  <p>But PMQs should also been an opportunity for the prime minister to listen, as well as to communicate, and one would imagine than Johnson would have left the chamber more persuaded than ever about the need for some mass government intervention to protect workers. If Felicity Buchan, a Kensington Tory with a background in banking, is saying that the government does not need to worry about borrowing any more (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough?page=with:block-5e7213bc8f085e564ad865ee#block-5e7213bc8f085e564ad865ee\">12.29pm</a>), then it is hard to see what is restraining No 10.</p> \n  <p>Johnson has a proper announcement to make during the session. In response to a question from Corbyn, he confirmed that the government would legislate to protect renters from eviction during the coronavirus crisis. He told MPs:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can indeed confirm that we will be bringing forward legislation to protect private renters from eviction, that is one thing we will do, but it is also important as we legislate that we do not simply pass on the problem, so we\u2019ll also be taking steps to protect other actors in the economy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson also announced that coronavirus testing was being ramped up to 25,000 tests a day. And, although he did not reveal what the government\u2019s employment support measures would involve, his answers on this were intriguing. He did not dismiss out of hand the temporary universal basis income idea floated by Blackford, or Bryant\u2019s call for a handout in the form of a summer version of the winter fuel payment.</p> \n  <p>Johnson was also interesting on the subject of schools. He told MPs:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The house should expect further decisions to be taken imminently on schools and how to make sure we square the circle both of making sure we stop the spread of the disease but also making sure we relieve, as much as we can, pressure on our NHS.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>That sounded very much like a hint that the government will announce a partial closure of schools, with some provision being kept open - perhaps for children of key workers, or perhaps with schools in childminding rather than education mode? - to minimise the impact on the NHS.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T13:26:14.986Z\">at 1.26pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7216cc8f088d7575595abd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/harrietsherwood\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T13:22:01.644Z\">1.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <strong>Catholic church</strong> in <strong>England</strong> and <strong>Wales</strong> is suspending services from Friday until further notice. </p> \n  <p>A letter from Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the archbishop of Westminster, says: \u201cIn response to the coronavirus pandemic, so many aspects of our lives must change.

Alex Marshall, chair of the IWGB Couriers and Logistics branch, said: <br><br>\u201cDeliveroo and other so-called gig economy employers have to stop blocking their workers\u2019 access to these funds and immediately introduce full contractual sick pay, without pre-conditions. <br><br>\u201cIncreasingly, these workers are being expected to play a huge role in feeding people during this time of crisis, so it is time for their employers and the government to give them the basic rights we expect in any decent and just society.\u201d<br><br>The Guardian has contacted Deliveroo for comment. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e721a298f085c6327bc23ea\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T13:02:04.610Z\">1.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In these unusual times, with social distancing, working from home and self-isolation taking effect the world over, sales of sex toys appear to have seen an uplift. </p> \n  <p>Stats suggest <strong>UK</strong> sales are up 13%, whilst in <strong>Canada</strong> they have soared by 135% and by 71% in <strong>Italy</strong>.</p> \n  <p>Perhaps our G2 commissioning editor puts it best:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisPJGodfrey/status/1240244055730278401\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Just read a press release claiming that Covid-19 has seen sex toy sales shoot up by 135% in Canada and 71% in Italy.

A handful of large stores with pharmacies have continued to stay open. </p> \n  <p>The changes have been introduced so quickly that the retailer is still updating the information online. A Tesco spokesperson said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are changing these store hours to ensure we can serve customers better at this time.

Like the CBI, it thinks the chancellor needs to go further. This is from <strong>Paul Johnson,</strong> the IFS\u2019s director.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The support through business rates holidays and payments is targeted directly at the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors many of which will be suffering a lot, especially in light of yesterday\u2019s new announcements discouraging people from patronising such businesses. This is a substantial level of support. However, it is probably not well targeted at saving jobs in those industries. It will remain as expensive to pay people and if demand is down then jobs are likely to go. Supporting employment might require a targeted package which included targeted cuts to employer national insurance contributions, a delay in increases to the national living wage, and increased support for individuals through universal credit. Government might also want to facilitate people being able to move into jobs where there is now much greater demand \u2013 delivery drivers and warehouse workers for example \u2013 in a way which allows them to return easily to their original jobs once the crisis is over.</p> \n   <p>Firms outside the leisure and hospitality sector have not been targeted with this additional direct support.

As Heather Stewart reports <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/17/rishi-sunak-pledges-350bn-to-tackle-coronavirus-impact\">in the Guardian\u2019s overnight splash, </a>Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, yesterday announced a \u00a3350bn package of loans and grants (\u00a3330bn in loan guarantees, \u00a320bn in grants and other handouts) to help businesses struggling as the economy grinds to a halt. Judging by today\u2019s front pages, national newspaper coverage is generally positive, but this morning the CBI, the country\u2019s biggest business organisation, joined the Labour party in saying this did not go far enough.</p> \n  <p>In an interview with the Today programme <strong>Carolyn Fairbairn</strong>, the CBI director general, said Sunak had announced a \u201cserious and massive package of measures\u201d, but she said firms needed help now to allow them to keep people in work. She said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The absolute top priority right now is for businesses to be able to keep their people in jobs, in employment, and we think there needs to be more on that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Fairbairn said the CBI wanted the government to use the national insurance system to pump money into companies. Instead of paying national insurance, they would get a cheque for \u201creverse national insurance\u201d from the government. She explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This is about using existing systems, it\u2019s all about speed. So the thought that we have put to the chancellor is to reverse national insurance contributions - not just defer or cancel them, but actually get the flow working in the other direction.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Fairbairn said a similar system was operating in Germany.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have a very well functioning national insurance system; reverse it, to enable businesses to make that judgment about whether to keep people or not keep them. This will be a very quick measures to introduce.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>She also suggested that VAT bills should be deferred.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There are some very large tax bills hitting companies in the next few weeks. We have a \u00a335bn VAT bill. This is an immediate impact; it doesn\u2019t require businesses to apply for anything. So looking at the tax bills, and seeing if they can be cancelled or deferred.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This will not come as a surprise to Sunak, who said yesterday that he would be announcing employment support measures and that he was still working on the details with employers and unions. This morning <strong>Alok Sharma</strong>, the business secretary, said this would be ready \u201cvery soon\u201d.</p> \n  <p>From today Politics Live will be a bit different because we will be covering all UK coronavirus developments here, and not just Westminster politics.

  "<p>The Vermont senator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders\">Bernie Sanders</a> got <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/17/2020-four-states-primaries-coronavirus-election\">thumped</a> in the latest round of Democratic presidential primary contests and, once again, Sanders and his team are reassessing their path forward.</p> <p>It\u2019s becoming a familiar cycle: former vice-president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> beats Sanders, the darling of progressive grassroots voters;<strong> </strong>the Sanders campaign concedes the situation isn\u2019t ideal, and spends some time reassessing. That\u2019s what happened earlier this month after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/mar/18/joe-biden-wins-democratic-primaries-bernie-sanders-donald-trump-coronavirus-live-updates\">Super Tuesday</a> contests on 3 March, and this Tuesday night and Wednesday morning.</p> <p>On Wednesday Sanders, the campaign said, would first vote on coronavirus legislation in the Senate and then later in the day he would fly with his wife Jane back to Vermont where he would have conversations with supporters.</p> <p>\u201cThe next primary contest is at least three weeks away. Senator Sanders is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign,\u201d Sanders\u2019 campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said in a statement. \u201cIn the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2020/mar/18/democratic-primary-delegate-count-latest\">Democratic primary delegate count - latest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Sanders campaign also sent out an email to supporters with a similarly gloomy tone.</p> <p>\u201cNo sugarcoating it, last night did not go the way we wanted,\u201d Shakir wrote in that email. \u201cAnd while our campaign has won the battle of ideas, we are losing the battle over electability to Joe Biden.\u201d</p> <p>The email did not include a usual link to make a donation to the campaign. Instead it linked to Sanders\u2019 response on how the federal government should be responding to the coronavirus pandemic, a signal that the campaign is at least slightly inching away from a relentless campaign mode.</p> <p>There were three contests on Tuesday night and Biden beat Sanders in all of them. More ominous for Sanders, Biden beat him by double digits in all three states. Biden won decisively by about 14 points in Illinois.</p> <p>In 2016, Sanders narrowly lost to former secretary of state Hillary Clinton there by less than three percentage points. In Florida, Biden beat Sanders by almost 40 percentage points. In Arizona, Sanders lost to Biden by about the same margin he lost to Clinton in 2016.</p> <p>The prospect of Sanders dropping out is so strong that for a few moments on Wednesday a report about Sanders suspending campaign ads on Facebook was misread as Sanders suspending his campaign.</p> <p>The next set of contests are in states that were more favorable to Sanders in 2016 \u2013Hawaii and Alaska, in particular. But the larger problem for the Vermont senator is the delegate math. As of Wednesday Biden led Sanders by 1,153 pledged delegates to 874. Even before Tuesday, Sanders would have to have won the lion\u2019s share of delegates in coming contests.</p> <p>The Biden campaign has been hesitant to declare victory outright but has argued publicly and behind the scenes that Biden\u2019s delegate advantage is unassailable.</p> <p>In a conference call with donors ahead of the Tuesday\u2019s primary results, Greg Schultz, a top adviser for the campaign, said the Biden team felt they had a \u201cvery clear delegate trajectory that would require Sanders to so overwhelmingly out-perform\u201d in the next few primary contests, according to audio obtained by the Guardian.</p> <p>On Wednesday morning, Unite the Country, a Super Pac supporting Biden, released a memo going even further.</p> <p>\u201cLast night\u2019s overwhelming victories in Arizona, Illinois and Florida are likely to add at least 150 delegates to Joe Biden\u2019s already commanding delegate lead. Even without <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/17/dnc-memo-primary-delays-could-result-delegate-reduction\">Ohio voting</a>, Joe Biden effectively ended the race last night,\u201d the memo said.</p> <p>\u201cHe will be the Democratic nominee, and for Unite the Country, the focus now turns to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">November</a>. The turnout generated by the vice-president continues to surprise everyone. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/17/us-elections-voters-coronavirus\">Despite the virus</a>, total turnout in Arizona and Florida exceeded 2016 numbers, and just like in previous states this primary season, there was particularly robust turnout in the types of suburban communities where we need to show strength this fall.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d40ee9b857eda90c3c895169619554b440585287\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d40ee9b857eda90c3c895169619554b440585287/0_200_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders greet each other with their elbows at the last Democratic presidential debate, in Washington.

Because of the pandemic, Sanders\u2019 campaign cannot hold the energetic rallies that are a pillar of the campaign, Democratic strategist Julian Mulvey, who advised Sanders in 2016, said.</p> <p>\u201cPart of the difficult challenge now is they can\u2019t hold rallies. The rallies have always been, in one sense, the central part of the campaign,\u201d Mulvey said. \u201cIt\u2019s direct connection with Bernie and the grassroots and people. It\u2019s him getting on the ground, delivering his 90-minute stump speech \u2013 delivering his giant stump speech. I think it\u2019s very important for the energy on the ground, it\u2019s very important for Bernie.\u201d</p> <p>But Sanders allies and strategists from the progressive wing of the party still see value in the Vermont senator continuing the campaign.</p> <p>\u201cIn this moment of national crisis, Bernie\u2019s platform is more salient than ever: Republicans and centrist Democrats alike are suddenly echoing his calls for free healthcare, expanded paid sick leave, and unemployment insurance,\u201d progressive Democratic strategist Monica Klein said in an email to the Guardian on Wednesday.</p> <p>She added: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen from exit polls that Bernie\u2019s economic and healthcare platforms are widely supported by Democratic voters \u2013 so whoever we end up with as our nominee, the Democratic ticket needs to embrace the bold economic solutions that Bernie has championed since day one.\u201d</p>",

We have no information on these people. We don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve been infected. They risk jeopardising our combined efforts because they don\u2019t understand that their personal health depends on the health of everyone else.

  "<p>As multiple cities go into lockdown across the US, services such as<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/grocery-delivery-apps-see-record-downloads-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/\"> </a>Instacart, Uber Eats, Seamless and DoorDash <a href=\"https://www.fox19.com/2020/03/17/food-delivery-drivers-expecting-surge-orders-following-restaurant-shutdown/\">are expecting huge surges</a> in delivery orders. Amazon is <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-delivery-jobs-hiring-drivers-2019-5\">hiring hundreds of extra workers</a> to keep up with the demand. This raises an ethical dilemma: is it morally acceptable to ask others \u2013 normally in less secure jobs with worse pay \u2013 to take on a risk that you don\u2019t want to? </p> <h2><strong>Are couriers more at risk of catching Covid-19?</strong></h2> <p><em>Dr</em><em> Thomas Tsai, infectious diseases expert: </em>The Covid-19 virus is borne by droplets transmitted through, for example, coughing and sneezing. There is a unique challenge for food delivery couriers who are potentially traveling between multiple sites: from restaurants and from house to house. Especially if they are making deliveries to families who are in quarantine because they\u2019ve tested positive for the infection. Given the number of people they see daily, the deliverers are probably among those at greatest risk of exposure, so they do need to be careful. If we can minimize unnecessary food delivery, we should.</p> <h2><strong>Are there ways to reduce the risk to both customers and couriers?</strong></h2> <p><em>Dr</em><em> Stephen Morse, epidemiologist</em>: It\u2019s impersonal, and perhaps seems extreme, but a food delivery could be left in front of the door (and a tip left similarly for the delivery person), much as we do with other packages, so there\u2019s no need for face-to-face contact. There may be transmission through inanimate objects, which we can try to minimize with good hand hygiene. </p> <p>If the no-contact approach makes for too impersonal an interaction, keeping some distance (3-6ft, arm\u2019s length if both delivery person and recipient extend their arms?) is an alternative to consider. Delivery people should be washing their hands or using a suitable hand sanitizer after making deliveries. Along with healthcare and law enforcement/fire personnel, that may be a good group for more intensive testing.</p> <h2><strong>Is coronavirus transmissible via food or food containers?</strong></h2> <p><em>Tsai: </em>The early evidence suggests that the virus is inactivated by heat. So I think cooked foods minimize the risk of any transmission from the food itself. </p> <p>I don\u2019t have any data to be able to say yes or no regarding food containers. But again, I think it\u2019s a good idea until we get more information to still maintain some vigilance. So it\u2019s not a bad idea to wash your hands before you look through containers and potentially to wipe down some of the exterior surfaces. That\u2019s erring on the side of caution. But I think in this time of uncertainty, it\u2019s the prudent thing to do.</p> <h2><strong>Is it ethical to order food online?</strong></h2> <p><em>Carissa V\u00e9liz, ethicist: </em>Society always relies on a minority of people to carry out risky or unpleasant jobs that not everyone is willing to do. To be ethical, ideally, those people should be paid more than others who have more comfortable jobs. </p> <p>Try to do your best. If you order, treat couriers kindly and convey your ethical concerns to companies. Ask if workers\u2019 jobs are being made as safe as possible, and whether they can take sick leave. If you boycott, make sure companies know why you\u2019re doing it, otherwise it won\u2019t have the desired effect.</p> <p>And suppose you order from a family business where they are careful towards their workers and so on, then it\u2019s not clear to me that that it\u2019s unethical at all. On the contrary, one concern is that small businesses will go under during this time, and that will be terrible for the economy as a whole and for families too. So we have to balance it.</p> <p><em>Morse</em>: I think the real ethical questions are in the personnel policies. These delivery people do not get any paid sick leave and in fact, may not have any income if they\u2019re not working. If they\u2019re sick, or test positive, can they stay home until they\u2019re recovered and no longer infectious?</p> <h2><strong>What do couriers want people who are ordering in to know?</strong></h2> <p><em>Lauren Casey, gig workers organizer: </em>In general, consumers aren\u2019t aware that many, if not most, of the fees they are paying don\u2019t actually make it back to the worker, when they interact with the gig economy. So be careful making any assumptions about what fee the worker is being paid.</p> <p>These workers need good compensation especially because they don\u2019t have access or good access to benefits like paid time off or unemployment insurance. So it doesn\u2019t automatically make you bad if you order in.</p> <p><em>Wilfred Chan, courier: </em>Whether or not you order won\u2019t change the calculus for workers who have no choice but to do it either way. So the best you can do is be considerate. Here\u2019s how:</p> <ol> <li><p>Tip \u2013 that makes a huge difference. In New York, $2 is really the bare minimum, $5 is OK, but in this situation I really think $10-$15 would be fair considering the danger of every single trip.</p></li> <li><p>Social distancing \u2013 delivery apps now provide the option to ask for a no-contact drop-off.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Beneath a photo circulating on social media showing what was said to be a waiting room at a distribution centre in Nottingham, one driver wrote of his experience after delivering hundreds of thousands of tablets.</p> \n<p>\u201cI asked if as a driver I still had to sit in this so-called drivers\u2019 rest room \u2026 surrounded by other drivers coughing and spluttering \u2026 and was told yes you do \u2026 you cannot sit in the cab due to health and safety regulations.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another photo at a different hub showed a printed notice stating: \u201cDrivers. Given the current concerns over the coronavirus we must refuse you using the toilet due to the welfare of our employees. Thank you for your cooperation. The management.\u201d</p> \n<p>A Health Service Executive spokesperson said: \u201cWe are concerned about these reports. Any prevention of a driver to access welfare facilities is a breach of law, but more importantly is not the decent thing to do.\u201d</p> \n<p>The controversy comes as workers in other sectors also expressed concern at conditions. They included staff at the pub chain Wetherspoon, who told the Guardian of fears about having to continue working in busy pub environments without masks, hand gel or other protective equipment.</p> \n<p>They spoke out as the company announced that its pubs would remain open \u2013 but customers will pay by card, avoid standing at the bar and sit at alternate tables.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re effectively going to become Petri dishes,\u201d said one worker who said that he and others should be provided with hand gel, gloves and face masks.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe come into contact all day with the general public, we handle money, dirty plates, glasses, sometimes bodily fluids, and the fact we can\u2019t wear a mask/gloves front of house is making people feel on edge. We of course are washing our hands as often as possible but it\u2019s just bizarre we aren\u2019t allowed to protect ourselves.\u201d</p> \n<p>He and others also called for the government to issue an order shutting down the pub trade, adding the \u00a395-a-week statutory sick pay which employees would receive would barely go towards meeting rental and other costs.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, a trade union representing so-called gig economy workers called on Deliveroo to immediately reform its Covid-19 hardship fund. The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) said it had been set up in a way which made it impossible for many riders that are genuinely sick or self-isolating to claim the payments.</p> \n<p>One Deliveroo driver in Sheffield said he felt torn over whether he should go back to work seven days after he came down with flu-like symptoms and was denied access the company\u2019s Covid-19 fund.</p> \n<p>The driver, a father-of-three who preferred not to be named, said he had been left struggling to pay his rent and bills and to buy food for his family after losing a week\u2019s worth of pay from his delivery work.</p> \n<p>He says the automated NHS 111 would not supply him with a sick note and, although he was able to get through to his local family practice, a GP told him there was no capacity for them to do so either.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>He said: \u201dNow I\u2019m thinking, is it really worth it?

He said: \u201cAbsolutely we do not rule out \u2026 because it would be quite wrong to do so \u2026 we do not rule out taking further and faster measures in due course.\u201d</p> \n<p>His remarks came as Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, suggested the government was considering a far tougher strategy to deal with the coronavirus.</p> \n<p>She attends the government\u2019s regular emergency Cobra meetings and said she expected the UK government to announce \u201cmore stringent measures\u201d for the capital, where the disease is spreading at a faster rate than the rest of the country.</p> \n<p>Asked if he would introduce legislation to specifically reduce people\u2019s movements, Johnson said it was not a natural choice for a government that valued liberty, but he ruled nothing out when the pandemic reached its peak.</p> \n<p>One source with close knowledge of the capital\u2019s response to the outbreak said any plans were not imminent and had not been discussed with key organisations who would have to be involved, such as the Metropolitan police, City Hall and those handling London\u2019s response.</p> \n<p>London has the highest level of infection and that rate is being monitored daily. The government is also getting daily figures on transport use in the capital. The Guardian understands the latest figures show a sharp drop, since the government urged people to stay home on Monday, with use of the tube network down almost 50% on its normal level and bus use down almost 40%. </p> \n<p>In some European countries including Italy and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/france-at-war-how-parisians-are-coping-with-life-under-lockdown\">France</a>, people have been restricted to their houses and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/italy-charges-more-than-40000-people-violating-lockdown-coronavirus\">face a fine if they leave</a> for any reason other than to buy food, visit the pharmacy or go to their job if they cannot work from home.</p> \n<p>The British government has come under criticism for its failure to bring in mandatory social distancing measures to slow the spread of the virus, with Johnson saying on Monday only that people should avoid \u201cnon-essential contact\u201d.</p> \n<p>One source at City Hall said there had been no word of immediate action from No 10 on moving to far more strict measures on people\u2019s movement.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve not been told anything at all about this yet, which would indicate there\u2019s nothing due immediately. But we are ready to take what action is needed to protect the health of Londoners,\u201d the source said.</p> \n<p>Other sources said that with London confirmed as being more advanced than the rest of the UK in the spread of the disease, the general expectation was that new containment measures would be rolled out in the capital first.</p> \n<p>Asked about the possibility of a lockdown for London, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said the measures to protect people from coronavirus would be guided by scientific advice.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e8a5d369-ef41-4b4a-adf8-f34313e47e32\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you've started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;<b>stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.<br></p>\n    <p>If you live with other people,&nbsp;<b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p>After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine.

  "<p>Nicola Sturgeon took part in a meeting with a complainant and one of Alex Salmond\u2019s former aides, a witness has told the high court in Edinburgh at the former first minister\u2019s sexual assault trial.</p> <p>Geoff Aberdein, formerly Salmond\u2019s chief of staff, told the jury he met the complainant and the current first minister in Sturgeon\u2019s office in the Scottish parliament on 29 March 2018.</p> <p>Salmond, Sturgeon\u2019s predecessor as first minister and Scottish National party leader, is on trial facing 13 charges including one of attempted rape, one of intent to rape, nine charges of sexual assault and two of indecent assault.</p> <p>Salmond, who denies all the charges, was formally acquitted of a 10th sexual assault allegation on Monday after the charge was withdrawn by the prosecution.</p> <p>Salmond told the court on Tuesday that the charges were fabrications and exaggerations. He said allegations from at least five complainants were orchestrated or exaggerated.</p> <p>Giving evidence on the second day of Salmond\u2019s defence case, Aberdein told the court he had two meetings with a complainant in early March. He said that at the second meeting, she told him there had been two retrospective complaints about Salmond.</p> <p>Questioned by Gordon Jackson QC, Salmond\u2019s lawyer, Aberdein said: \u201cI think she was seeking to make me aware but also to see if Alex Salmond was aware of this, but I didn\u2019t know and I hadn\u2019t spoken to Alex Salmond for some time.\u201d</p> <p>Jackson asked: \u201cWas there ever at any time from her the slightest hint that she was making a complaint about Alex Salmond\u2019s behaviour?\u201d Jackson asked him. Aberdein replied: \u201cNever.\u201d</p> <p>As Jackson appeared to finish his questioning and walked towards his seat, Salmond leaned across in the dock and spoke to him quietly. Jackson returned to the lectern and asked Aberdein: \u201cI\u2019m reminded; tell me if I\u2019m wrong. There was a meeting between you, [a complainant] and Nicola Sturgeon?\u201d</p> <p>Aberdein confirmed a meeting had taken place in Sturgeon\u2019s office. Asked if that complainant had given \u201cany hint of any personal involvement\u201d in issues around the misconduct at a further meeting, Aberdein said \u201cnever\u201d.</p> <p>The court heard earlier on Wednesday from Samantha Barber, a company executive, that another complainant, H, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was not present at a dinner with a celebrity at Bute House, the first minister\u2019s official residence in Edinburgh, in June 2014.</p> <p>Salmond was charged with attempting to rape H after that dinner in an upstairs bedroom, after physically preventing her from leaving. She alleges Salmond was drunk, and stripped off his and her clothing before becoming aroused, and lying on her naked body. She also alleges Salmond sexually assaulted her at Bute House in May 2014.</p> <p>Salmond denied her allegations on Tuesday and claimed instead they had a \u201cconsensual sexual encounter\u201d in August 2013, which H initiated after both of them had been drinking.</p> <p>The celebrity told the court via a video recording last week that H had been at the dinner on the night alleged, where they had shared a bottle of wine. Barber was asked by Jackson whether there were only three people at the dinner: herself, Salmond and the public figure. She replied: \u201cThat\u2019s my recollection, yes.\u201d</p> <p>Jackson asked Barber if she remembered seeing H at any time that evening in Bute House. She replied: \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Alex Prentice QC, for the prosecution, asked Barber several times why she had delayed talking to Police Scotland detectives who were investigating complaints against Salmond in late 2019 and earlier this year.</p> <p>Prentice told the court she had told police she wanted to get advice from the law firm Levy McRae. Barber said she did not necessarily mean advice from lawyers. \u201cI wanted to take advice because I didn\u2019t understand the judicial process. [I] needed to understand the responsibility I had to the judicial process.\u201d</p> <p>The court also heard from defence witnesses who said they did not see alleged assaults at Stirling castle or during campaigning in Glasgow in 2008, despite being present at the time.</p> <p>Another witness, Tasmina Ahmed Sheikh, a former SNP MP, told the court that H had also been very angry Salmond did not support her in a career move.</p> <p>The hearing continues.</p>",

Obviously if you have caring responsibilities, some things are going to be out of your control, but you\u2019re going to be freshest in the morning. There\u2019ll also be less distraction from email and your group chat sending you the latest scary news from the pandemic.</p> <p>Once you\u2019ve got the tasks that require the deepest thought out of the way, you can switch to bitsier, more reactive work. You\u2019ll probably find you get more work done in less time, so if you\u2019ve got the kind of job that requires you to be online <em>just in case</em> work comes in, you can spend the rest of the day doing things you enjoy like reading or baking while you wait for your inbox to ping.</p> <h2><strong>Have a routine and stick to it</strong></h2> <p>You\u2019ll need to lock in a routine fairly quickly and stick to it if you want to be productive working from home.</p> <p>Writers in full throttle will have a schedule that wouldn\u2019t look out of place in the military.

And now it appears Tom Brady will spend the final years of his professional career <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/17/tom-brady-tampa-bay-bucs-nfl-free-agency\">playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a>.</p> <p>I repeat: Tom Brady, he of six Super Bowls, New England Patriots fame, is departing the most successful team in modern NFL history and is all but certain to move his operation to Tampa, Florida, in order to join a team with the NFL\u2019s third-worst record over the past decade. The Patriots went 125-35 between 2010 and 2019, winning three Super Bowls: The Buccaneers: 59-101, with zero playoff appearances.</p> <p>Brady leaving the Patriots to join the Bucs is as much about lifestyle as anything else. Tampa\u2019s coach, Bruce Arians, is famed for his laidback, there\u2019s-more-to-life-than-football style. He drinks beers in the parking lots with the players and their families after games. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/bruce-arians-fire-bucs-coaches-missing-kids-events-2019-8?r=US&amp;IR=T\">He threatens to fire coaches</a> if they miss a dance recital or ballgame or a family member\u2019s birthday. \u201cThose years don\u2019t come back,\u201d Arians famously said.</p> <p>Arians certainly does not reflect the ruthless, win at all costs Patriot Way. For Brady, a man soon-to-be in his mid-40s, the family stuff starts to matter a whole lot more.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/18/new-england-patriots-tom-brady-leaves-nfl-football-boston\">Hated by Them, loved by Us. With Tom Brady's exit the Patriots dynasty is over</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are football reasons for the switch, too. The Bucs have one of the best two-man receiving tandems in the sport: Mike Evans and Chris Godwin. There is also a chance Antonio Brown joins the group. He and Brady have remained in close contact, and Brown worked under Arians back in his Pittsburgh days. And you can chuck into that mix tight end OJ Howard, who is as physically gifted as any at his position in the sport, though he fell victim to Arians\u2019 scheme \u2013 which almost vehemently opposes the use of tight-ends as pass-catchers \u2013 in the coach\u2019s first season in Tampa.</p> <p>The Bucs were impressive on both sides of the ball last season, despite Jameis Winston tossing 30 interceptions. In fact, it\u2019s likely that Brady surveyed the landscape and sought out the best possible defense rather than offense when making his decision. The Bucs defense <a href=\"https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/nfl/team-defense/2019\">finished fifth in DVOA</a> last season. The other two Brady suitors? The Raiders, 31st; the Chargers, 21st.</p> <p>The fit between coach and quarterback remains iffy. Arians is known as a fun-n-gun coach, someone who wants his quarterbacks to make long throws. When his offenses have been at their best \u2013 first in Pittsburgh and then in Arizona \u2013 it\u2019s been when he\u2019s had a strong-armed quarterback who could throw the ball deep down the field outside the numbers, often supplemented with a sound running game.</p> <p>That\u2019s not Brady. He is a rhythm player: hit the back foot, get the ball out. Everything he does is about precision and timing. In New England, Brady was also the master of pre-snap manipulation. He controlled everything and the Patriots ran everything: two-back sets, spread-sets, motions, shifts, fullbacks, h-backs. The Patriots align players anywhere and everywhere. Players\u2019 roles shift on a week-to-week, concept-to-concept basis. Wide receivers become ball-carriers, and they shift between inside and perimeter positions. Running backs are used as a deep threat in the passing game. It was a complex, all-encompassing system.</p> <p>And it all flowed through Brady. He digested each morsel of information and made sure the team used the best play possible against whichever look a defense presented. Indeed, the Patriots system was always at its best when Brady was able to jump into the no-huddle, marshaling things alone at the line of scrimmage.</p> <p>None of that fits the Arians philosophy. The coach is more rigid, more reliant on a core set of plays, with far less pre-snap motion, which typically helps a quarterback identify what a defense is trying to do. Over the past decade, Brady\u2019s Patriots have hovered around the 20% motion mark. The Bucs under Arians: 6%.</p> <p>Adjustments flow both ways. Will Arians let Brady bring the New England blueprint with him? Will Brady welcome a shift away from a system that puts so much focus on his decision-making and timing rather than letting him just go out there and rip it?</p> <p>Remember: Brady will be 43 by the time the new season starts. His arm remains as strong as it\u2019s been since the early 2010s, but, barring a wild 2007 run, throwing the ball vertically has never been his biggest strength. Will Arians be happy running a system reliant on precise, underneath routes? If it works, you would think so.</p> <p>But it remains an essential question the pair must figure out together. Taking deep dropbacks would be a recipe for disaster. Tampa Bay\u2019s offensive-line ranks anywhere from solid to good by most metrics. They finished 22<sup>nd</sup> in adjusted sack rate and 16<sup>th</sup> in pressure rate. But even those numbers were slightly inflated by Winston\u2019s, umm, ability to go off-script, break a play, and avoid sacks.</p> <p>Tampa\u2019s group has talent, most notably inside. But they\u2019re a group built for an Arians offense, not a Brady one. They maul people in the run-game then set deep in the passing game.</p> <p>The shift to Brady couldn\u2019t be more radical. Brady isn\u2019t utterly immobile, but he\u2019s not exactly mobile either. He\u2019s a pocket shuffler. Others bob and weave like a boxer, keeping a play alive until they scamper away or find an open teammate. Brady likes to adjust the radar of a pass-rusher by a fraction. At high speed, it feels like a world of difference. They can see still him. It looks like he\u2019s in the same spot, but for some reason, he\u2019s now out of range. It is exceptionally effective, but only to a point. Brady has noticeably become gun-shy in the past two seasons, chucking the ball into the dirt or throwing it away in order to avoid big hits. There were times last season where he was inching closer to the fossil most quarterbacks become at the very end.</p> <p>But Brady is still good. That\u2019s important to note. Is he the Brady of old? No. But he still ranks as a league-average starter, one with a rolodex of football information stored in his brain. Wriggle his way into the post-season, and with the weapons, he has on the perimeter and a frisky Bucs defense, he would have a shot. That, along with a new challenge and a less pressurized environment, was probably what he was looking for.</p> <p>None of his other options were great. In Jon Gruden and the Las Vegas Raiders, he would have found a better schematic fit and someone who shares his football psychopathy. It wouldn\u2019t have been all that much fun, though. The Los Angeles Chargers, meanwhile, are a rotating morass of mediocrity and the little brother in a city that\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/07/away-fans-nfl-los-angeles-rams-chargers-home-crowds\">yet to prove it has an appetite for professional football</a>. In Tampa, Brady has found the best of some not-great situations. Arians is smart enough to step back or push, depending on what is needed.</p> <p>This move was about ego and joy. About respect. About credit, and how we, as a collective, apportion it between Brady and Belichick. Now, they will both go it alone, albeit at the back-end of their careers. Maybe Brady won\u2019t win a Lombardi, but as a steady hand on a team with a bunch of young talent, he will surely have some fun.</p>",
  "<p>Daryl Davis is a musician \u2013 a pianist to be exact. He has jammed with the likes of Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, BB King and even Bill Clinton. Loyal to music but not to genre, he plays jazz, blues, rock\u2019n\u2019roll, country, boogie-woogie, swing, big band and beyond. No matter the musical style, Davis will play it, because he believes that music in all its variations is a great equalizer. So when he entered the Silver Dollar Lounge in Frederick, Maryland, for a country gig one fateful night in 1983, being the only black man present did not perturb him at all.</p> <p>While this was not his first country gig at the Silver Dollar Lounge, it was his most significant. After he and his band finished their set, Davis was approached by a patron who was around 15 years his senior. Not an unusual occurrence for a working musician. However, while praising Davis on his performance, the patron candidly noted that he had never seen a black man who could play like Jerry Lee Lewis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/18/african-americans-techno-music-los-angeles-clubs-whitewashing\">'Make techno black again': a social experiment subverts whitewashing in clubs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More curious than offended, Davis used this encounter as an opportunity for friendly discourse rather than outrage. \u201cI explained to this older white guy that Jerry Lee Lewis was influenced by the same black boogie-woogie and blues piano players as I was,\u201d Davis says with a chuckle. \u201cHe didn\u2019t believe me. Then I told him that Jerry Lewis is a good friend of mine and well, he didn\u2019t believe that either, but he was fascinated.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo he asks me to join him for a drink,\u201d he continues. \u201cI don\u2019t drink so I had a glass of cranberry juice and then he took his glass and cheered me. Then he said, \u2018You know, this is the first time I ever sat down and had a drink with a black person.\u2019 I was instantly curious and thought, \u2018What\u2019s going on here?\u2019 So I asked him why. He didn\u2019t answer at first but eventually admitted that he was a member of the Ku Klux Klan.\u201d</p> <p>This is a story Davis shares on lecture stages and in classrooms \u2013 both nationally and globally. It is an important anecdote as it marks a catalytic moment in which Davis\u2019s trajectory pivoted from working musician to race relations crusader.</p> <p>What began as a hobby gradually transformed into a calling. As his music career continued to flourish, Davis also became enmeshed in quite arguably the world\u2019s strangest side hustle \u2013 meeting with KKK members of various ranks and attending so-called cross lighting rallies. Some of these Klansmen became close friends of Davis\u2019s \u2013 the aforementioned Silver Dollar patron included \u2013 their long conversations untangling a knot of hate that had coiled for decades. In many cases, these civil dialogues led them to quitting the organization because they no longer believed in its tenets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cb37d4aa759494b50a29aed84768443f96c38f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cb37d4aa759494b50a29aed84768443f96c38f7/0_0_1209_907/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daryl Davis and a KKK member.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daryl Davis and a KKK member.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Daryl Davis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While some say Davis converted these men, he prefers to say that they converted themselves, and that he merely provided the impetus for them to do so. Over the past 30 years, Davis has become well-versed in the organization\u2019s ethos and hierarchy which led to him to becoming the first black man to write a book about the KKK entitled Klan-destine Relationships: A Black Man\u2019s Odyssey in the Ku Klux Klan<em>, </em>which was published in 1998.</p> <p>The Ku Klux Klan was formed in 1865 by a group of Confederate soldiers at the end of the American civil war in an attempt to keep newly emancipated slaves suppressed. Having seen several iterations, what remains consistent across all chapters of the group is its hate toward people of color, sometimes resulting in assault and murder. In 2018, 153 years later, a record high of more than 1,000 hate groups \u2013 including the KKK \u2013 were documented as active in the United States by the <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/news/2019/02/19/hate-groups-reach-record-high\">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> civil rights group. \u201cOur ideology needs to catch up to our technology,\u201d Davis said recently as a guest on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGTQ0Wj6yIg\">Joe Rogan Experience podcast.</a></p> <p>So why would a successful musician like Davis willingly meet with high-ranking KKK members in his spare time? The journey to that answer begins long before his Silver Dollar Klan encounter in 1983.</p> <p>\u201cIn 1968, when I was the age of 10, I had a racist incident,\u201d Davis recalls with conviction, his voice sonorous and unwavering. \u201cI was in the Cub Scouts and we were in a parade when people started throwing rocks and things at me. I didn\u2019t understand why people would do that and I formed a question: \u2018How can you hate me when you don\u2019t even know me?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe answer was always, \u2018there\u2019s some people who are just like that,\u2019\u201d Davis adds. \u201cWell, that wasn\u2019t good enough for me. What does \u2018just like that\u2019 mean? Where does that come from? You\u2019re not born \u2018just like that. I was curious about racism ever since, but even still, nobody can seem to answer the question.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORp3q1Oaezw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ORp3q1Oaezw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>One of Davis\u2019s first and most fabled encounters was with Grand Dragon Robert Kelly, who eventually became the Imperial Wizard of Maryland. After having his secretary set up a meeting with Kelly under the pretense of including him in a book about the KKK, Davis knew he was entering new territory. Kelly was unaware that Davis was black, so the grand reveal was a shock. After a few tense hours of conversation, the two parted ways, but their relationship did not end there.</p> <p>Eventually, Kelly began inviting Davis to his home and then to Klan rallies in which ritualistic chants were intoned, giant crosses were burned, and beer and hot dogs were served. Kelly shared everything with him, including the deeply racial stereotypes that help form the foundation of the Klan\u2019s hatred. All the while, Davis listened, asked questions, took notes, and through his actions, slowly dispelled each stereotype one by one. With each conversation, the gap between them narrowed and they were able to become friends.</p> <p>Finally, Kelly quit the Klan, shut down his entire chapter and, as a trophy of sorts, gave his robe to Davis. That was not the last Ku Klux Klan robe that Davis would be gifted nor was it the last Klansman he would befriend.</p> <p>\u201cI still perform sometimes and though I would much rather be on stage playing happy music all the time and seeing people dance than be talking about the KKK and neo-Nazis,\u201d Davis says with a laugh, \u201cI have found that lecturing and talking and educating people is far more important and necessary today.\u201d</p> <p>Davis has lived through several eras of hate \u2013 from the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr in 1968 to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/02/christopher-hasson-coast-guard-neo-nazi-far-right\">the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally</a> in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. Though he has convinced hundreds of white supremacists to deradicalize and join the land of the loving, he does not deny that some are beyond saving. However, that acknowledgment does not deter his mission as he continues to focus on those who are open to conversation, open to civil discourse, open to friendship, and ultimately, open to change.</p> <p>Most recently, Davis partnered with Minds.com, an open source social networking platform that uses blockchain to reward the community with ERC20 tokens. Davis hopes to utilize this platform, founded by Bill Ottman and John Ottman, to educate people on how to conduct civil discourse. Beyond the world of white supremacy, the idea is to help individuals navigate through opposing perspectives \u2013 be it at a political protest, in a classroom, on social media, or at the dinner table.</p> <p>\u201cPeople must stop focusing on the symptoms of hate, that\u2019s like putting a Band-Aid on cancer,\u201d Davis says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to treat it down to the bone, which is ignorance. The cure for ignorance is education. You fix the ignorance, there\u2019s nothing to fear. If there\u2019s nothing to fear, there\u2019s nothing to hate. If there\u2019s nothing to hate, there\u2019s nothing or no one to destroy.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The development geographer Sylvia Chant, who has died aged 60 of pancreatic cancer, challenged the idea that households headed by women were automatically more likely to live in poverty than those headed by men.</p> <p>When she began her research in the 1980s, much other research and policymaking portrayed households headed by women in the developing world as poverty-ridden. Sylvia argued that it was not necessarily poverty in itself that disadvantaged women in cities of the global south, but rather their multiple household responsibilities and obligations in relation to men.</p> <p>Her fieldwork in Mexico, Costa Rica, the Philippines and the Gambia showed that measuring the incidence of poverty through measuring the number of households headed by women was inaccurate.</p> <p>In her books <a href=\"https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9780230378049\" title=\"\">Women-headed Households</a> (1997) and <a href=\"https://www.e-elgar.com/shop/gbp/gender-generation-and-poverty-9781843769927.html\" title=\"\">Gender, Generation and Poverty</a> (2007) she demonstrated that such households were more numerous than is usually assumed, but also could provide women with autonomy and freedom. She recounted numerous stories of how women who headed households and their daughters were much more likely to go out to work as they were free from the control of husbands and fathers who often forbade women from entering the labour market.</p> <p>Even though these women were able to make their own decisions, she also highlighted the dangerous tendency for them to take on multiple responsibilities inside and outside the home, balancing domestic and paid work.</p> <p>Sylvia really engaged with the women \u2013 and to a lesser extent, men \u2013 whom she interviewed and kept in touch with many of them years after her first encounters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"396a4d08801520b5ba0033ad6d5f4277b2459f67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/396a4d08801520b5ba0033ad6d5f4277b2459f67/0_0_968_1219/794.jpg\" alt=\"Sylvia Chant at the Dropping of the Knife campaign in Wassu, the Gambia, in 2013\" width=\"794\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sylvia Chant at the Dropping of the Knife campaign in Wassu, the Gambia, in 2013</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: none</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Keen to work with other researchers, she co-authored and edited 11 of her 18 books, including four that we wrote together, of which the most recent was <a href=\"https://www.environmentandurbanization.org/cities-slums-and-gender-global-south-towards-feminised-urban-future\" title=\"\">Cities, Slums and Gender in the Global South</a> (2016).

For example, she co-authored the UN-Habitat report <a href=\"http://www.zaragoza.es/contenidos/medioambiente/onu/994-eng.pdf\" title=\"\">State of Women in Cities 2012-13</a>, arguing for acknowledgment that cities everywhere had large numbers of female-headed households and that gender issues must be taken into account in urban planning if cities are to prosper in the future.</p> <p>Her work with the <a href=\"http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/57870/\" title=\"\">Gambia Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children</a> contributed to the country\u2019s final outlawing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/female-genital-mutilation\" title=\"\">female genital mutilation</a> in 2015.</p> <p>Born in Dundee, Sylvia was the daughter of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/jun/16/stuart-chant-obituary\">Stuart Chant</a>, a microbiologist, and his wife, June (nee McCartney), a legal secretary. She grew up in London and attended Lady Margaret school in Parsons Green and, for the sixth form, Kingston College. She gained a geography degree (1981) at <a href=\"https://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">King\u2019s College, Cambridge</a>, where she developed her feminist approach to her life and work.</p> <p>This led to her PhD at University College London in 1984, supervised by Peter Ward and <a href=\"https://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/people/emeritus/alan-gilbert\" title=\"\">Alan Gilbert</a>, studying <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272929299_Family_Formation_and_Female_Roles_in_Queretaro_Mexico\" title=\"\">the role of women in the construction of housing in Quer\u00e9taro, Mexico</a>. This was among the first studies that recognised women as key actors in self-build housing in poor urban communities in countries of the global south.</p> <p>Following a postdoctoral position at UCL, and a year at the University of Liverpool, in 1988 Sylvia moved to the LSE. She worked in its department of geography and the environment and in conjunction with its gender institute (now department) for the rest of her career.</p> <p>Her first book, Women in the Third World (1989, with <a href=\"https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/dasa/brydon-lynne.aspx\" title=\"\">Lynne Brydon</a>), argued for the importance of analysing women\u2019s roles in rural and urban areas of the global south, drawing on voices and interpretations from the grassroots rather than crude statistical analyses. <a href=\"https://www.developmentbookshelf.com/doi/book/10.3362/9780855987916\" title=\"\">Mainstreaming Men into Gender and Development</a> (2000, with <a href=\"https://watson.brown.edu/people/faculty-fellows/gutmann\" title=\"\">Matthew Gutmann</a>) argued for the importance of including men in gender and development debates and projects, suggesting that genuine feminist transformation would not be possible without such engagements, while ensuring that women were not re-excluded.</p> <p>Sylvia\u2019s research also shed light on countries such as Costa Rica and the Gambia, where limited research on gender issues had previously been undertaken. In Costa Rica, she worked in the province of Guanacaste, traditionally associated with cattle ranching and tourism, to show that women\u2019s lives in small towns were dominated by short-term out-migration of men to work in seasonal agriculture and that it was women who were the bastions of households and communities.</p> <p>In the Gambia, in contrast to much research that focuses on sex tourism, she worked not only on FGM but also on gender and youth and how school enrolments alone did little to ensure that young women were able to develop personal freedom and decent employment in later life; this would only be possible with educational policies that integrated gender equity into curriculum development.</p> <p>After a first marriage that ended in divorce, in 2002 Sylvia married Chris Mogridge; he survives her, along with her mother, June, and two sisters, Adrienne and Yvonne.</p> <p>\u2022 Sylvia Hamilton Chant, development geographer, born 24 December 1958; died 18 December 2019</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Powis Castle Gardens</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/powis-castle-and-garden\" title=\"\">Powis</a> is a pocket battleship among great Welsh houses. Its red stone walls rise like a medieval apparition on a hill overlooking the upper Severn. It was the citadel of the Welsh Marches, five miles from the English border. Its princes were a devious bunch, never knowing on whose side they stood between England and Wales. Today their fortress, normally open to the public, stands guard over the valleys leading into once-impenetrable Wales. Round it over the centuries, successive Herberts have laid out the most extraordinary terraced gardens in Britain. Clipped yews tumble down the hillside, apparently gone berserk, spilling over walls and balustrades. Between them are buried rich herbaceous borders. It is like Kew Gardens tilted 45 degrees. To one side a formal Edwardian parterre tries to pretend Powis has been tamed. Mercifully it has not. Views from the terraces are spectacular, looking out over the lush hills and meadows of the Severn valley. But behind still lurk the dark forests of Wales. The castle, cafe and shop are closed but the gardens will remain open from 10am-4pm.

One of my favourite views in Cornwall can be found at Loe Bar, the improbably narrow shingle bank that separates the Loe from the sea. Standing between the two you look into two separate, and wholly beautiful, worlds. On one side, heavy Atlantic seas pound the sand and on the other, the dense woodland around the pool is calm and sheltered, an oasis in turbulent times. I can lose whole days wandering along the miles of isolated, winding pathways around the Loe through marshes, woodland and lakeside, which has a rare, unspoiled feel to it, as no water sports are allowed at any time.

Wilkie Collins raved about the Loe in his 1861 travel book, <a href=\"https://www.wilkie-collins.info/books_rambles.htm\">Rambles Beyond Railways</a>, in which he wrote: \u2018No fairy vision of Nature that was ever imagined is more fantastic, or more lovely than this glorious reality.\u2019 And, more recently, the estate inspired Xan Brooks\u2019 altogether grittier novella, <a href=\"https://shop.nationaltrust.org.uk/savage-lovely-cornish-homes.html\">Savage Lovely Cornish Homes</a>, which was published by National Trust Books last year, and which may provide an alternative dip into the Loe for those unable to make it to Cornwall. I will be heading out for walks here with my children in the coming weeks where, if we\u2019re lucky (and quiet), we\u2019ll see herons, otters and deer. In the event we don\u2019t (we\u2019re rarely that quiet), we will retell stories inspired by this beautiful place, of King Arthur throwing Excalibur into the lake, and the giant Jan Tregeagle of Cornish mythology, who created Loe Bar when he dropped his bag of sand while being chased by the devil.<br><strong>Wyl Menmuir</strong></p> <h2><strong>Studley Royal, North Yorkshire</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24347e096c03955eff4b30bd2d3def21f2351664\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24347e096c03955eff4b30bd2d3def21f2351664/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Footbridge ove the River Skell in the grounds of Studley Royal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When I want to see big trees in wide open spaces, which is quite often these days, I head for <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/fountains-abbey-and-studley-royal-water-garden\" title=\"\">Studley</a>.

  "<p>Pandemics don\u2019t just affect our health \u2013 they rip through our economies, too. For many people affected by the coronavirus, including those who don\u2019t fall sick, economic survival will be a primary concern. When businesses close and workers no longer get paid, the bills for unpaid rents, mortgages and consumer loans quickly accumulate. Cities have already shut down swaths of their transport services, shops, cafes and cinemas. Mass lay-offs are on the horizon. Unemployment insurance will cover some, at least for a time. But self-employed and temporary workers, and households that live pay-cheque to pay-cheque, don\u2019t have such buffers.</p> <p>If you have some savings and only a little debt, the situation is tricky enough. But since the debt-fuelled financial crisis in 2008, household debt has grown. In the UK, total household debt stood at \u00a31.28 trillion for the period from April 2016 to March 2018 according to the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/householddebtingreatbritain/april2016tomarch2018\">Office of National Statistics</a> (ONS).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/governments-crisis-coronavirus-business\">This crisis calls for massive government intervention: here's how to do it | Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>UK households now owe a record average of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/07/average-uk-household-debt-now-stands-at-record-15400\">\u00a315,385 to credit card companies, banks and other lenders</a>.<strong> </strong>Significantly, the UK\u2019s total household debt was three times larger than the total wealth held by <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/householddebtingreatbritain/april2016tomarch2018\">its </a><em><a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/householddebtingreatbritain/april2016tomarch2018\">lowest</a></em><a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/householddebtingreatbritain/april2016tomarch2018\"> wealth decile</a>. Similarly, the <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc.html\">US Federal Reserve</a> reports that household debt had reached a new high by the end of 2019: aggregate household debt stands at $14.15 trillion, $1.5 trillion higher in nominal terms than in 2008.</p> <p>The 2008 crisis should have been a reminder that debt is not a substitute for income. Likewise, ensuring households can afford the basics of everyday life by broadening access to loans and credit cards is no replacement for effective social policy. But instead of heeding these lessons, governments focused on fixing the financial sector, bailing out the banks to ensure they would lend again.</p> <p>Low interest rates made it seem as if the debt that households and firms accumulated would be manageable. Yet according to the ONS, households in the UK that rented rather than owned their property or had an unemployed primary earner were already <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/householddebtingreatbritain/april2016tomarch2018\">experiencing debt problems</a> prior to the 2008 crisis. To make matters worse, the management of excessive debt was <a href=\"http://private-law-theory.org/?p=18546\">privatised after the crash;</a> <a href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/debt-and-money/debt-solutions/individual-voluntary-arrangements/\">Individual Voluntary Arrangements </a>(IVAs) replaced personal bankruptcy, often at great expense to borrowers.</p> <p>As a result, we are now watching two overlapping crises unfold: the coronavirus pandemic, and the economic threat it poses to our debt-fuelled economy. We urgently need debt relief \u2013 especially for households at the lower end of the income and wealth spectrum. Most interventions that governments have taken so far have targeted<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/17/rishi-sunak-pledges-350bn-to-tackle-coronavirus-impact\"> financial markets and businesses</a>. Unless governments also implement measures aimed at indebted households and renters, such measures are unlikely to prevent a meltdown driven by rapidly falling demand for goods and services.</p> <p>The economists Gabriel Zucman and Emmanuel Saez have called for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/governments-crisis-coronavirus-business\">social insurance scheme</a> to tackle the economic shock wrought by coronavirus. This would broaden the government\u2019s role, making it not just a lender but a buyer of last resort. The scheme would compensate for the demand that has evaporated from the economy. With the airline industry, for example, if demand for flights drops by 80%, the government would buy 80% of plane tickets. Small and medium-size businesses, which are the least insulated against economic shocks, are most likely to benefit from this intervention. Still, on its own, this wouldn\u2019t alleviate the stress of many deeply indebted households.</p> <p>As the crisis deepens, policy makers will inevitably focus on trying to rescue the financial institutions that are central to our economic system from collapse. This is how most crises unfold. Households are usually treated as peripheral to the system. The failure of many households does not put the system at risk, and can therefore be treated as an afterthought. Crises begin at the periphery, in the absence of wealth cushions or other safety valves, and eventually ripple back towards the centre. Early interventions to stabilise the periphery can therefore help mitigate stress at the centre of the system. Even more importantly, such measures help instil trust and legitimacy in government interventions aimed at stabilising financial institutions.</p> <p>Debt relief programmes have a long history. In the US, for example, debt moratoria were fairly common in the 19th century. An agricultural economy that relied heavily on debt was highly vulnerable to exogenous shocks, such as the collapse of global commodity markets. Many state legislatures temporarily suspended debt enforcement, or mandated government powers over foreclosures and asset sales. More recently, India implemented a debt relief programme in the midst of the 2008 crisis to support the agricultural sector, where a rising tide of suicides signalled the deep distress of many farmers. <a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/701902?mobileUi=0&amp;\">Empirical studies</a> have shown that these interventions significantly lowered the rate of subsequent default among indebted households.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/boris-johnson-covid-19-response\">Johnson says this is war. But his response to Covid-19 is laughably inadequate | Aditya Chakrabortty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To be sure, it is not easy to tailor debt relief to only truly distressed households. There will always be free riders who will take advantage of debt relief packages without needing to do so. But this shouldn\u2019t prevent governments from intervening now. There is no better example of an exogenous shock than coronavirus. The overriding concern today shouldn\u2019t be moral hazards, but massive default rates that will leave millions of people destitute.</p> <p>To treat the economic fallout of coronavirus, governments should directly assume the debt of high-risk households. Trying to incentivise financial intermediaries to modify the terms of existing loans, as the US government did with the Home Affordable Modification Program after the 2008 crisis, will be too slow to meet the current challenge.</p> <p>It\u2019s often said that the public health of the majority is determined by the most vulnerable in society. The same logic applies to a healthy political and economic system: its stability depends on how it treats its weakest members. Hedging our bets on an economic system that has neglected these truths and instead prioritised wealth creation at the top has put us all at risk. There is still a small window to rectify these past wrongs, by urgently granting debt relief to the households worst affected by coronavirus.</p> <p>\u2022 Katharina Pistor is the author of <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691178974/the-code-of-capital\">Code of Capital: How the Law Creates Wealth and Inequality</a><br><br></p>",
  "<p>Nicholas Stern, one of the most prominent global experts on the climate crisis, has urged Boris Johnson to resist calls to postpone vital UN climate talks this year, despite the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/02/vital-cop26-climate-talks-could-be-derailed-by-coronavirus\">coronavirus</a> outbreak.</p> <p>Ministers and officials have privately discussed the possibility of postponing the Cop26 talks scheduled for Glasgow this November, but no decision has yet been taken. Travel bans and the shutdown imposed in many countries because of the virus have resulted in cancelled meetings and officials working remotely.</p> <p>Lord Stern believes any move to postpone the talks would put paid to any hope of making real progress. \u201cAt the moment we must just get on with the preparation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is such an urgent challenge and there is so much to do, and so much valuable work that is being done, that we can\u2019t afford to lose the momentum.\u201d</p> <p>At Cop26 \u2013 the 26th conference of the parties \u2013 countries are supposed to come up with more stringent plans to curb greenhouse gas emissions, because current plans under the Paris agreement are inadequate. The UK was hoping to bring many countries to the table <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/03/saving-the-planet-uk-role-vital-if-cop-26-climate-talks-to-succeed\">with pledges to hit net zero carbon by 2050</a>, a target that the UK has already enshrined in law.</p> <p>Stern said work had become more difficult because of the virus, but not impossible. Postponing the summit now would effectively put the brakes on at a time when acceleration is needed, he said, and if needs be then a postponement could be discussed after the summer, depending on the situation then.</p> <p>Stern is backed by other former high-ranking diplomats. Yvo de Boer, a former chief of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), who led talks in Copenhagen in 2009 that ended in acrimony, said it was vital to keep working towards a November Cop26. \u201cIf it is going to be cancelled, that should only be done at the last possible minute \u2013 in October,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\ufeffOne former high-ranking official who helped put together the Paris agreement said: \u201cCancelling now might look like the UK was grasping too soon for a way out of an important meeting.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"89ffbc03a5b6a575d35aefa320a1aaff97813470\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89ffbc03a5b6a575d35aefa320a1aaff97813470/0_202_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicholas Stern\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicholas Stern: \u2018We can\u2019t afford to lose the momentum.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Nicholson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some NGOs and developing country experts also view talk of postponement as counterproductive. Mohamed Adow, the director of <a href=\"https://powershiftafrica.org/\">Power Shift Africa</a> and a close observer of the talks for many years, said: \u201cWe would rather not see it cancelled until we know more about the spread of the virus. Cancelling it immediately might mean action on climate change gets ignored this year and people on the frontlines in poorer countries can\u2019t afford that.\u201d</p> <p>Janine Felson, the deputy chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, said: \u201cWe cannot afford to lose any momentum. We should all focus our energies on ensuring that we can support each other through this trying time and continue to push for ambition.\u201d</p> <p>But some experts contacted by the Guardian believe postponing the talks would provide more time for diplomacy. John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, has written to Alok Sharma, the business secretary and president of Cop26, urging him to delay.</p> <p>He said: \u201cPostponement is very different to cancellation. It would be the same president, the same venue, the same two countries co-hosting, so all you are doing is having a slight delay. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/07/mary-robinson-attacks-unhelpful-uk-over-cop-26-climate-talks\">The UK got off to a slow start</a> [in launching its strategy for hosting Cop26] so postponement would give more time for the work that is needed.\u201d </p> <p>One key issue is that the US presidential election is due to take place a week before Cop26 begins. Donald Trump is strongly opposed to the Paris agreement and his withdrawal from it will take effect the day after the election. A new president, if there is one, could be more amenable to climate action but would not take office until January, so a postponement could allow the US to participate.</p> <p>Paul Bledsoe, a strategic adviser at the Progressive Policy Institute in the US, said: \u201cOne distinct advantage of delay until spring 2021 is the growing prospect that US voters will turn Trump\u2019s climate nihilism out of office in favour of Joe Biden\u2019s robust climate ambition, infusing global negotiations with far greater importance and momentum.\u201d</p> <p>Some pre-Cop meetings are already in doubt. The UNFCCC has cancelled all meetings for the next month but a decision will have to be taken soon on an intermediate meeting set for Bonn in June. Italy is due to co-host Cop26 with the UK but its plans have been thrown into disarray by the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>The UK government has said there are no plans for a change. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe continue to work towards hosting the event in Glasgow in November, which is eight months away. Given this is an evolving situation we are keeping the situation under careful review.\u201d</p> <p>The UNFCCC also said there was no immediate move to postpone the talks. Any decision would have to be taken by the <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/process/bodies/supreme-bodies/bureau-of-the-cop-cmp-and-cma\">Cop Bureau</a>, made up of elected representatives from various countries, and would also involve the Chilean government, which technically will preside over the process until the UK officially takes on the presidency in November. </p>",
  "<p>It is one of life\u2019s great injustices that America claims to be the birthplace of crosswords. Yes, the first \u201cWord-Cross puzzle\u201d ran in 1913 in the New York World\u2019s Fun supplement, instructing readers to \u201cfill in the small squares with words which agree with the following definitions\u201d, but the man responsible, Arthur Wynn, was born in Liverpool. What\u2019s more, his idea wasn\u2019t original but based on similar word puzzles he\u2019d enjoyed in children\u2019s newspapers before emigrating.</p> <p>More grievous is that Americans don\u2019t even do proper crosswords, making do with the type this newspaper deems \u201cQuick\u201d. By \u201cproper\u201d I mean cryptic, the kind that separates true cruciverbalists from mere dabblers, invented in the UK in 1925. To me, the true crossword is the cryptic, its concise cousin an aberration. I have my own family to thank for my stringent criteria: my great-grandfather, Prebendary AF Ritchie, set them weekly for the Listener magazine. I still remember his own puzzle collection, published under the pseudonym Afrit, being brandished by my grandpa, who seemed to think I would be a natural successor to Afrit\u2019s talents. Alas no.</p> <p>But then I read <em>Thinking Inside the Box</em> and realised the richness of the American relationship to crosswords. Adrienne Raphel, an aficionado, mixes history with reportage from the crossword frontlines. She journeys to Stamford, Connecticut, for the annual American Crossword Puzzle Tournament, and takes a crossword-themed cruise to mark 75 years of New York Times\u2019s puzzles. Her writing is packed with the sort of beautifully observed details you\u2019d expect from a New Yorker contributor. \u201cAt the ACPT, the reigning aesthetic was orthotics meets checkerboard.\u201d A snippet about competitive puzzlers preferring a lower case \u201ce\u201d because it\u2019s quicker to scrawl than an \u201cE\u201d conveys the competitors\u2019 dedication.</p> <p>She has a stab at submitting her own puzzle to the NYT\u2019s crossword editor, Will Shortz. The chapter on her own compilation doubles as a useful social history. \u201cIn the middle of the 20th century, the New York Times crossword became America\u2019s version of BBC English. Being able to complete the crossword signalled that you\u2019d arrived in a certain echelon of education, and no matter your background, you could manoeuvre in a specific aspirational cultural milieu.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5f5c45ce7e80e15d28dead8167a3a862b772eef3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f5c45ce7e80e15d28dead8167a3a862b772eef3/8_105_955_573/500.jpg\" alt=\"Adrienne Raphel \u2026 a true puzzle aficionado\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adrienne Raphel \u2026 a true puzzle aficionado</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Raphel describes how the composer Stephen Sondheim tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to convince Americans to up their crossword game. \u201cThere are crossword puzzles and crossword puzzles,\u201d she quotes him saying in a 1968 New York magazine article. \u201c\u2018To call the composer of [an American] crossword an author may seem to be dignifying a gnat,\u2019 he quipped, but cryptics were different,\u201d Raphel writes. Sondheim wrote several cryptics but the genre remained niche.</p> <p>Although the book comes billed as equally suitable for crossword virgins as superfans, Raphel waits until chapter nine to confess she is \u201caverage\u201d at best. \u201cI\u2019m a hunt-and-peck solver \u2026 I admire cryptic crosswords from afar, like bonsai.\u201d She broadens her focus from American puzzle fans, dipping into the crossword\u2019s literary roots. Vladimir Nabokov \u201cthought in crosswords\u201d, publishing the first Russian puzzle in 1924 from Berlin \u2013 while in France, Georges Perec created complex <em>mots crois\u00e9s</em>. In Kirchstetten, Austria, WH Auden filled in conversational lulls by filling in puzzles. Back in the UK, Arthur Conan Doyle, Dorothy Sayers and PG Wodehouse all liberally deployed crosswords as plot devices.</p> <p>Raphel\u2019s preoccupation with the American form and US crossword personalities means that she misses the opportunity to delve deeper into how Edward Powys Mathers invented the world\u2019s toughest puzzle challenge for the Saturday Westminster Gazette. (He also established the tradition that cryptic setters use a pseudonym: his was Torquemada, the first Spanish grand inquisitor.) And she omits Afrit, my great-grandfather, and his golden rule of cryptic clueing - \u201cI need not mean what I say, but I must say what I mean\u201d \u2013 from his 1949 book, <em>Armchair Crosswords</em>. (This newspaper\u2019s own crossword editor, Hugh Stephenson, has said Afrit was one of the forces centrally involved in codifying the \u201crules\u201d of the modern cryptic clue.) Raphel mentions only Ximenes \u2013 Derrick Somerset Macnutt \u2013 Torquemada\u2019s successor at the Observer. Yet Ximenes himself said he learned more from Afrit than Torquemada.

  "<p>While the government often seems to show callous indifference to Britain\u2019s rough sleepers, on Tuesday it was announced that a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/3-2-million-emergency-support-for-rough-sleepers-during-coronavirus-outbreak\">pot of money </a>would be provided to help our homeless people avoid coronavirus.</p> <p>It is good the government has acted \u2013 but now for the bad news: rather than a policy or strategy, this feels little more than a contemptuous wad of cash chucked into the collective begging bowl of Britain\u2019s most vulnerable people.</p> <p>Meanwhile, there is a simple solution staring the government in the face \u2013 pass emergency legislation to commandeer some of Britain\u2019s now near-empty hotels and house homeless people in them.</p> <p>A grand total of \u00a33.2m is to be distributed to Britain\u2019s councils to do as they see fit with rough sleepers. To call it a pittance is insulting to pittances. Official government figures suggested there were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/18/rough-sleeping-figures-cannot-be-trusted-says-statistics-chief\">4,677 people</a> sleeping rough in 2018 (the most recent figures). This is thought to be a huge underestimate. Last month it was revealed that council data showed almost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/26/uks-official-rough-sleeping-numbers-far-lower-than-reality\">25,000 people</a> slept rough in 2019. So if we go by official figures this would amount to \u00a3684 to take each rough sleeper off the streets and keep them safe. Take the more disturbing estimate of 25,000 homeless people and you\u2019re down to \u00a3128 per head. Keeping homeless people safe is an expensive business, and this isn\u2019t the best of times.</p> <p>So despite the comforting words from the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, that he is providing money for society\u2019s most vulnerable to self-isolate, the reality is it looks as if the government is prepared to let thousands of rough sleepers die under bridges, in shop doors and outside train stations. Perhaps the only time the prime minister will truly address the problem is when it becomes a threat to his leadership \u2013 that is, when the public get physically and morally repulsed by walking over dead bodies. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Perhaps the only time the prime minister will truly address the problem is when the public get physically and morally repulsed by walking over dead bodies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Most homeless people on the street have hugely compromised immune systems \u2013 a result of sleeping rough itself and, all too often, drug and alcohol addiction \u2013 and therefore are at a heightened risk of contracting coronavirus. In the most recent figures from the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsofhomelesspeopleinenglandandwales/2018\">Office of National Statistics</a> the mean average age of death for rough sleepers was 45 for males, 43 for females, and two in five deaths of homeless people was related to drug poisoning. The total estimated number of rough sleeper deaths was 726, a 22% year-on-year rise. It doesn\u2019t bear thinking what these figures will look like for 2020 if the government doesn\u2019t act now.</p> <p>Last week the campaigning group <a href=\"https://museumofhomelessness.org/#\">Museum of Homelessness</a>, alongside a coalition of homelessness organisations, called on the government to house our rough sleepers in hotels. But clearly the government\u2019s \u00a33.2m offer wouldn\u2019t be anywhere near enough to do this \u2013 the Museum of Homelessness <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MuseumofHomelessness/posts/1070980529922469?__xts__[0]=68.ARAidLhvDhZNlZSHjWcfEg6J9x7YFVHPpqChvWQaY7r49fxis_mPIYmRHP0vu_EfulJRlSO1GWNulI-AkqlmRPjcG0HrBh1CkyTLl7ed6PublSRiQbPjUiY5qGwqhUYtdhAd95QJqrAWnkzLO2363RYW9a7Isytt5JzuNBLdtPm_U6zDhqw2L9xatx84sX0zSLE8XFt6kZvrYjXtZwayLT_T6msf2SQ2jV3kIw1SXGx_DNzA-QLuMewdmlypIHNonPIeA6gW1VwXtj2n-Rn1N95C48q4JJ2HoQN45GteovL1s12AvEhkPb2uz0j4OzZ21f0bktf7NrVK2q4n1MCCGg&amp;__tn__=-R\">stated</a> that the government\u2019s \u00a3500m hardship fund for local authorities, and more if necessary, \u201cshould be used to block-book hotel rooms with a bathroom so people can isolate\u201d.</p> <p>It may sounds like a pipe dream, but it isn\u2019t \u2013 and shouldn\u2019t be. This solution makes sound economic sense for a prime minister desperate to keep the economy churning. Not only would it save lives if homeless people self-isolated in hotels, it would boost the economy and keep some people desperate for work in employment. What makes government intervention even more urgent is that the country\u2019s winter night shelters are due to close in the first week of April. Hotel bedrooms would provide a relatively safe environment for medics to treat people with coronavirus, for addiction and mental health agencies to provide support, and for the public to drop off donations.</p> <p>It won\u2019t work perfectly for all homeless people (some may refuse to go indoors and some may refuse to isolate because of the need to feed addictions) but it would work for many.</p> <p>Are there enough hotel bedrooms? You bet there are. In 2016 there were an estimated <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/613883/number-of-hotel-bedrooms-uk/\">874,300 bedrooms</a> in hotels and similar accommodation in the UK. So to accommodate the larger council estimate of the UK\u2019s rough sleepers would take up 2.9% of the nation\u2019s hotel bedrooms (while the official estimate would account for 0.5% of the rooms).</p> <p>Meanwhile the public is asking what it can do to help homeless people in the pandemic. The rules are pretty much the same as ever \u2013 be kind, chat to homeless people, ask if they want food/drink, give money if you fancy, act responsibly, and don\u2019t take risks for their sake and yours (sitting on filthy pavements with people, which we might do in normal times, is obviously unhygienic.) Donate useful things to individuals and charities. Many charities are running low on toilet roll, long-life milk and hand-sanitiser. So if you have bought few extra bottles, cartons or rolls, salve your conscience by donating some to those in need.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-exposed-extent-uk-social-crisis\">Coronavirus has exposed the extent of the UK's social crisis | Owen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But our individual acts are small fry.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/07/saudi-arabia-womens-rights-jail\">Loujain al-Hathloul</a> first realised that speaking up could make a difference when she was five years old. Her father, a navy veteran who wanted his children to be strong swimmers, took her to the local pool where other visitors chastised him for bringing a girl in a pair of swimming trunks to the male-only area.</p> <p>\u201cHe told them that if they were uncomfortable with what a five-year-old girl was wearing then that was their problem,\u201d said Loujain\u2019s sister, Lina. \u201cAfter that, lots of fathers started taking their little girls along to swim.\u201d</p> <p>As an adult, Hathloul has been arrested and detained several times for defying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/saudiarabia\">Saudi Arabia</a>\u2019s ban on women driving and for campaigning for an end to the kingdom\u2019s male guardianship system. In May 2018 she was arrested along with other prominent activists. They were tortured, spent months in solitary confinement and were eventually charged with destabilising national security and working with foreign entities against the state.</p> <p>Almost two years since her kidnap and arrest and after multiple delays in the trial, Hathloul\u2019s family are again urging the kingdom to free her and end the crackdown on critics of the crown prince, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/mohammed-bin-salman\">Mohammed bin Salman</a>.</p> <p>A hearing scheduled for 10 March was cancelled without explanation and rescheduled for Wednesday following demands from Hathloul\u2019s parents, who are acting as her legal representatives. That hearing has now also been cancelled, and all court dates in the country will probably be postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cLoujain is very strong and knows that she isn\u2019t forgotten about, even though the whole legal and prison system is designed to wear her down,\u201d said Lina, who lives in Brussels.</p> <p>\u201cThe government is trying to sell a narrative of reform and show that the kingdom is \u2026 becoming more liberal. The best way to do that would be to admit that the activists who are being detained are not criminals and to let them go.\u201d</p> <p>When Prince Mohammed ousted his uncle to become the appointed heir to his father King Salman\u2019s throne in 2017, he promised social and economic reform in the conservative absolute monarchy.</p> <p>While some changes have been made \u2013 women can now drive, the religious police have been reined in, and women can now travel without the permission of a male guardian \u2013 the reforms have been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent and any perceived threats to the crown prince\u2019s power.</p> <p>Loujain campaigned for the right for women to drive and was imprisoned just before the law was changed. The message, Lina said, was to show that change in Saudi Arabia only comes from the top down.</p> <p>\u201cThere is currently an atmosphere of fear in Saudi Arabia,\u201d she said. \u201cWe used to live under a harsh system but we knew what the red lines were. Now, we don\u2019t know what will cause trouble and what won\u2019t. They invite western musicians to come and give concerts, but Saudi women who attend get arrested for dancing.\u201d</p> <p>Loujain\u2019s time in prison, marked by torture and ill-treatment, is a stark warning. When her parents were allowed to visit her in December 2018, she showed them black scars on her thighs from electric shocks. She says she has also been whipped, beaten, waterboarded and sexually assaulted by interrogators who tried to take off her clothes and watched her while she slept.</p> <p>In desperation, the family went public with Loujain\u2019s ordeal. The Saudi government denies Hathloul was arrested unlawfully or that any form of torture has taken place.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not allowed to talk to Loujain directly for both of our safety, but from what I understand the physical torture has stopped but she is still suffering mentally,\u201d Lina said. \u201cAfter so long in solitary confinement, even the slightest noise really disturbs her now.\u201d</p> <p>One of the Hathloul family\u2019s other major concerns is that the charges against Loujain don\u2019t make sense: being in contact with foreign journalists and applying for a job at the UN are among the offences listed by the public prosecution.</p> <p>The kingdom\u2019s stated reasons for arresting Hathloul have changed over the last two years. In October 2018, Prince Mohammed said the detained women\u2019s rights activists were spies working to destabilise the kingdom, and that the security services had recordings to prove it. A year later, the crown prince said in an interview with US media that the Saudi judiciary was independent and he had nothing to do with the activists\u2019 cases.</p> <p>Faced with a legal system that was recently found by Amnesty International to still rely heavily on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/06/saudi-arabia-using-secret-court-to-silence-dissent-amnesty-finds\">confessions obtained under torture</a>, the family had to keep speaking out about Loujain\u2019s case, Lina said.</p> <p>\u201cMy sister refused to give up on making life better for women in Saudi Arabia,\u201d she said. \u201cWe won\u2019t stop either until Loujain is free.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A secretive Scotland Yard intelligence unit shredded a large number of documents after a public inquiry was set up into the undercover infiltration of political groups, a watchdog has found.</p> <p>The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) <a href=\"https://policeconduct.gov.uk/investigations/allegations-and-complaints-against-national-domestic-extremism-and-disorder\">announced</a> on Wednesday that it had found that documents had been destroyed despite an instruction that they had to be preserved.</p> <p>The watchdog found that an unnamed officer would have faced a disciplinary hearing on a charge of gross misconduct if they had not already retired from the Metropolitan police. Any officer found guilty of gross misconduct would be <a href=\"https://www.college.police.uk/What-we-do/Ethics/Documents/Guidance_on_outcomes_in_police_misconduct_proceedings.pdf\">likely to be sacked</a>.</p> <p>The watchdog said it was \u201cextremely unfortunate\u201d that a number of former managers had refused to cooperate with its inquiry.

The documents were shredded by the national domestic extremism and disorder intelligence unit (NDEDIU), a little-known squad that monitored political activists between May 2013 and November 2015.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/15/undercover-police-spies-infiltrated-uk-leftwing-groups-for-decades\">Police spies infiltrated UK leftwing groups for decades</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One officer said he <a href=\"https://policeconduct.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Op_Hibiscus_Final_report_for_publication.pdf\">saw a colleague standing next to a shredder</a> with a \u201csubstantial quantity\u201d of documents. The colleague told the IOPC that the documents related to undercover operations to infiltrate political groups dating from the 1990s and 2000s and more recently.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Sarah Green, an IOPC regional director, said: \u201cThis investigation has uncovered serious failings in the national domestic extremism and disorder intelligence unit and how it handled materials relevant to the undercover policing inquiry.</p> <p>\u201cManagers of NDEDIU should have done more to be clear about what material should be retained and ensure they had an auditable process for destroying any material believed to be duplicates or not relevant to the inquiry.\u201d</p> <p>She added that the officer, who worked outside the unit, would have faced a disciplinary hearing for allegedly failing to take action when the shredding allegation was first reported.</p> <p>The Met was alerted to the shredding allegations by a member of its staff in December 2014. However, the force did not draw the allegations to the attention of the watchdog until May 2016.</p> <p>Jules Carey, a lawyer from the Bindmans law firm who represents victims of the surveillance, said the watchdog\u2019s report underlined how the covert operations to infiltrate activists were out of control.</p> <p>He said the public inquiry, led by the retired judge Sir John Mitting, needed to compel officers to explain why the documents had been destroyed.</p> <p>The public inquiry had been due to start hearing evidence in public on 1 June. On Tuesday Mitting said the scheduled hearings had been postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>After the inquiry was set up, the police submitted a large number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/21/police-request-secrecy-undercover-officers-inquiry\">legal applications</a> to keep secret the identities of individual undercover officers. The inquiry had to decide whether each application was justified. This is a key reason why the inquiry has not started hearing evidence earlier. Victims of the surveillance have criticised the police and the inquiry for the delays.</p> <p>The Met accepted that the former officer who would have faced a disciplinary hearing should have done more to investigate the shredding allegation. \u201cAllegations of this nature undermine the Met\u2019s commitment to transparency and accountability \u2026 We are not complacent in making sure staff and officers know what they should do with material which may be useful for an inquiry.\u201d</p> <p>The IOPC said it had not found evidence to support two other allegations concerning the intelligence unit. </p> <p>In one, officers were alleged to have improperly destroyed files they had compiled on the Green party peer Jenny Jones. The IOPC found that the unit had <a href=\"https://policeconduct.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Baroness_Jenny_Jones_Final_report_for_publication.pdf\">recorded information about Jones\u2019s political activities</a> but decided that these were only passing references to her. </p> <p>It said there was no deliberate intention to destroy the records held on her. A whistleblower had alleged that the unit got rid of the records to prevent her from discovering the extent of the police\u2019s monitoring of her political work.</p> <p>In the second, officers were alleged to have used hackers to illegally access the private <a href=\"https://policeconduct.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Op_Gilbert_Final_report_for_publication.pdf\">emails of hundreds of political campaigners</a> and journalists.

The economy-boosting package they have trumpeted this week is in reality <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/17/chancellors-330bn-coronavirus-package-is-big-but-not-big-enough\">too puny a tool</a>, aimed at the wrong target. While other governments of every political hue attack their many-headed enemy with a range of formidable weapons, ours charges ahead with just one, merely promising that reinforcements will arrive at some unspecified date. Just as in dealing with the pandemic itself, we are lagging far behind our European neighbours.</p> <p>That is not how it has been treated by many newspapers. The front pages this morning hail Dishy Rishi and his \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/1240044721000644610?s=20\">kiss of life</a>\u201d, yet only last Wednesday those same publications swooned over his definitive corona-budget. A few days later, neither the measures nor their rapturous reception look quite so well-judged. At the time, I wrote on these pages that the emergency package \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/11/johnsonism-first-budget-hype-spending\">simply does not look large enough</a>\u201d. So it has proved.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s team are masters of the three-word slogan. Take Back Control; Get Brexit Done, and today: Whatever It Takes. All are grand-sounding promises that never quite come good because they simplify too far.</p> <p>The essence of our economic problem is easily summed up: to contain this disease, the economy must grind to a halt. Whether for entertainment or for business, over the next few months people can no longer gather together. The restaurant that did a roaring trade in February must now by Whitehall edict be shut down. However sound the business, no firm can keep going in such circumstances, which is why shops and museums across the country are already pulling down their shutters. Airlines and hotels everywhere face bankruptcy, while millions of employees around the world could lose their jobs.</p> <p>In speed and scale, this has all the makings of a depression \u2013 unless governments go big and fast. That is not what Sunak is doing. Last week, he extended sick pay for those struck down by the virus, when already the economic problem has metastasised to healthy workers getting laid off from becalmed businesses. He talked yesterday of a mortgage holiday \u2013 which big lenders are already offering \u2013 while saying nothing about renters. For firms he is putting up \u00a3330bn of loans and grants. Loans help to spread the burden of outgoings, which is why we take them to buy houses and cars, but for your local cafe owner who has just seen her revenues vanish, for God knows how long, they are utterly inadequate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9143d217c9beb39fa01d20adaaa8abe0308900fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9143d217c9beb39fa01d20adaaa8abe0308900fe/0_117_6107_3667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Closed shops in a market in Cardiff.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Closed shops in a market in Cardiff.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Horwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The government\u2019s supporters promise all will come in good time, but global pandemics do not work to the timetables of newbie chancellors. Meanwhile, Italy has suspended mortgages and rents, France has suspended utility bills and rent for small businesses and Denmark has agreed to pay as much as 75% of the wages of some private-sector employees rather than see them laid off. In each case, the rationale is the same: to lose a home, a company, a job does lasting damage to individuals, households, an entire economy. Better in this squall to tide people over than to let them drown.<br><br>These governments are following the same dictum as our Treasury officials, introducing \u201ctimely, targeted and temporary\u201d measures. But as Johnson\u2019s former economic adviser Gerard Lyons observes, they have added another T: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrGerardLyons/status/1239905382744707072?s=20\">titanic</a>. As in exceptional scale, not sinking ships. While no socialist, he calls on the British government to follow suit.</p> <p>A real bailout for the economy must have two main principles. First, it should put money in people\u2019s pockets right now, targeting the poorest. Successive prime ministers from Margaret Thatcher to Tony Blair to David Cameron have made our welfare system as punitive and mean as possible, supposedly to drive people into work. In this crisis we need it to serve an entirely opposite purpose: to encourage workers to stay at home. The last thing you want is a care worker shrugging off her cough and temperature because she needs to put food on the family\u2019s table.<br><br>That means raising sick pay alongside universal credit and other benefits, and lifting conditions and sanctions. If schools are to close, child benefit should rise and the nasty <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/31/government-urged-to-scrap-nasty-two-child-limit-on-benefits\">two-child limit</a> must be scrapped. All essential costs to keep a roof over one\u2019s head or one\u2019s business going should be suspended, which includes tax collection. The UK should follow the Nordic countries in being prepared to subsidise wages. Whatever money the government has promised the NHS, our hospitals clearly don\u2019t have enough resources right now, which is why A&amp;E doctors are wearing paper masks. Local authorities are having to respond to this crisis after years of being stripped of money by the Conservatives: that must be reversed. Given the likely hit to our GDP, the government cannot spend enough right now, especially with interest rates at zero. If Johnson is serious about leading a \u201cwartime government\u201d he should remember that during the second world war the UK ran a budget deficit of 20% of national income every year for five years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/national-emergencies-britain-government-health-covid-19-1940s-and-50s\">When it comes to national emergencies, Britain has a tradition of cold calculation | David Edgerton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just over 10 years ago, the banking crisis was resolved with vast amounts of public cash. The public was repaid for its support by seeing its social contract with the state and with employers ripped up. We got lower pay, fewer rights and the slashing of our public realm. That cannot happen again. This crisis has revealed the flaws in our political-economic system: insecure work, a cruel welfare system, businesses that expect the public to keep them afloat while doing little for the public good (look in the mirror, Richard Branson), and a government that will only drop its laissez-faire laconicism when confronted with the prospect of hundreds of thousands of deaths.</p> <p>And this is where we get to the second principle for saving the economy. Any bailout for airlines, say, can\u2019t involve taxpayers handing billions to Branson and others; there must be public stakes for public financial support. More widely, there needs to be a new contract with businesses that recognises they are social institutions reliant on society, and compelling them to play their proper role in it, from pay to how they run their supply chains.</p> <p>Wars often serve as the catalyst for such change. Income tax was a short-term measure to beat Napoleon. When coalition minister Ernest Bevin launched his crusade for full employment in the Commons, he recalled visiting a port with Winston Churchill before soldiers set sail for the D-Day landings in Normandy. One soldier asked: \u201cErnie, when we have done this job for you, are we going back to the dole?\u201d Bevin told MPs that he and Churchill answered almost as one: \u201cNo, you are not.\u201d</p> <p>This time we are asking frontline staff in hospitals and schools and town halls to risk illness and worse on our behalf. This follows years of their pay being held down and their institutions being cut to the bone, and after decades of seeing top earners march off with outsize returns. The least we can do is promise there will be no return to those days.</p> <p>\u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>Joe Biden swept three key primaries in Florida, Illinois and Arizona on Tuesday night, dominating a third consecutive week of elections as he built a nearly indomitable lead in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination under the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n<p>His resounding victories all but eliminated a path for his rival, Bernie Sanders, whose campaign is at a crossroads as he contemplates whether to stay in a fight for the liberal agenda he has championed for decades, or to exit and help Democrats unify the party behind his opponent as the country faces a public health crisis.</p> \n<p>After the win, Biden made an overture to Sanders\u2019 supporters, as he seeks to add to his lead. Biden said he and Sanders shared common goals, regarding healthcare, inequality and the climate crisis.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo let me say especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Senator Sanders, I hear you. I know what\u2019s at stake,\u201d Biden said, in a a livestream video posted after the Florida and Illinois results were declared.</p> \n<p>\u201cI know what we have to do. Our goal as a campaign, and my goal as a candidate for president is to unify this party, and then to unify the nation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sanders has far more support than Biden among young voters, who are more likely to be skeptical of Biden\u2019s incremental approach.<strong> </strong></p> \n<p>Biden\u2019s victories came as Donald Trump formally sealed the Republican presidential nomination, surpassing the necessary delegate threshold after facing no significant opposition.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/16/joe-biden-woman-vice-president-abrams-harris-klobuchar-warren\">Joe Biden's pledge to name a woman as running mate fires speculation</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Tuesday\u2019s elections underscored the uncertainty surrounding the Democratic presidential primary amid a global outbreak that has closed borders, roiled the economy and touched nearly every corner of public life. Ohio, which was also due to vote on Tuesday, postponed its elections, defying a court order and closing polls, even as Florida, Illinois and Arizona moved forward despite pressure to delay their contests.</p> \n<p>Before polls closed on Tuesday, Sanders delivered an address responding to the public health and economic crisis caused by the coronavirus outbreak. He predicted the US government would ultimately spend $2tn \u201cto prevent deaths, job losses and to avoid an economic catastrophe\u201d and called for every American household to receive monthly payments of $2,000 during the crisis.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur country and our world are facing an unprecedented series of crises,\u201d he said in remarks that made no reference to the election.</p> \n<p>More than 6,300 Americans have tested positive for the virus, despite limited testing, with 108 deaths <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">as of Tuesday evening</a>. The message from officials is that the outbreak will worsen dramatically.</p> \n<p>On Monday, Trump advised Americans not to gather in groups of more than 10, further restricting guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which recommended that no gatherings with 50 people or more be held for the next eight weeks.</p> \n<p>Against that backdrop, Mike DeWine, the Republican governor of Ohio, announced on Monday afternoon that he would seek to postpone the election until 2 June. Hours later an Ohio county judge rejected the request, saying it would set a \u201cterrible\u201d precedent.</p> \n<p>DeWine instructed the state\u2019s director of health to declare a public health emergency. He argued that holding the election would place voters and poll workers in potential danger.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe should not force people to make this choice, a choice between their health and their constitutional rights and their duties as American citizens,\u201d DeWine said at a press conference, adding: \u201cI think when we look back on this, we are going to be glad we did this.\u201d</p> \n<p>Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, assailed the move for causing \u201cmore chaos and confusion\u201d and sought to discourage other states from following suit.</p> \n<p>But it may be too late. Louisiana and Georgia were the first states to announce they would delay their primaries in response to the outbreak. Kentucky joined Ohio on Monday, choosing to delay its primary from 19 May to 23 June. And on Tuesday, Maryland became the fifth state to postpone its presidential primary election, moving it from 28 April to 2 June.</p> \n<p>Officials in Florida, Arizona and Illinois took additional precautions to ensure the safety of voters and poll workers, including sanitizing voting machines and offering curbside voting. But there were reports of poll worker shortages and confusion over polling locations.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9cd86439-9730-4d31-9420-04159eb9e36f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QbhWz5QD6R8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The virus has reshaped the 2020 election campaign in other ways.

On the eve of the latest primaries, Sanders participated in a digital rally from his hometown of Burlington, while Biden held a \u201ctele-town hall\u201d.</p> \n<p>The election delays have added another layer of unpredictability to a primary that has seen months of twists and surprises. Simon Rosenberg, a veteran consultant and the president of the New Democrat Network and the New Policy Institute, said coronavirus presented an \u201cunprecedented\u201d challenge for the party.</p> \n<p>\u201cDemocrats now must to find a way to complete this primary given the uncertainty of when each state is going to vote and whether we\u2019re even going to be able to have a convention in July,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Padding his delegate lead further, Biden was also finally declared the winner of last week\u2019s primary in Washington, a state Sanders hoped to win.</p> \n<p>In his remarks on Tuesday night, Biden made an explicit appeal to Sanders\u2019 loyal supporters.</p> \n<p>\u201cI hear you.

  "<p>Boarding school stories for children make up an entire genre, and have their lifelong devotees \u2013 but as in, say, the work of PG Wodehouse, the environment of these books is largely consequence-free.

The plot hinges on the theft of an exam paper and subsequent death of the boy who told on the perpetrators. Officials at Leoncio Prado were so outraged by its portrayal in the novel that they held a book-burning ceremony, proving that Britain doesn\u2019t have a monopoly on the association of residential education with deranged nationalistic fervour.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/26/bookerprize2005.bookerprize\">Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro</a><br></strong>One of Ishiguro\u2019s great gifts is to take a very specific context, loaded with constraints, and extract from it a voice and a story that become powerfully universal. Here, the backdrop is Hailsham, a boarding school in the English countryside, where, it emerges, the pupils are clones created for the purpose of having their organs harvested. As the novel progresses, its surface calmness and simplicity are increasingly at odds with a mounting and devastating sense of loss as the novel evolves into a meditation on life\u2019s compromises and squandered opportunities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"826473c0694c3908a8a4198fd05982eb450822a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/826473c0694c3908a8a4198fd05982eb450822a3/0_112_3508_2105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keira Knightley in the 2010 film of Never Let Me Go.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A meditation on life\u2019s compromises ...

Girls as young as 11 are told here that they must \u201clive constantly in the spiritual presence of death\u201d, so they \u201cmortify\u201d themselves by putting salt on their pudding instead of sugar, and affixing burrs to the inside of their uniforms. Even when Nanda\u2019s behaviour is exemplary, she is still admonished for lacking \u201cnormal, healthy, natural naughtiness\u201d. It\u2019s a booby-trapped environment of Exemptions and Permissions, where you can burn in hell for ever just for eating a found sweet on your way to communion.</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1928/oct/12/classics\">Decline and Fall by Evelyn Waugh</a><br></strong>Sent down from Scone College, Oxford for indecent behaviour after his trousers are stolen by a drunken member of the Bollinger Club, Paul Pennyfeather is exiled to teach at a purgatorial boarding school in Wales. On sports day, the hurdles have been burned for firewood and are replaced by five-foot-high spiked railings, and the starting pistol is Philbrick the butler\u2019s service revolver, which ends up being discharged into the heel of Lady Circumference\u2019s son, Lord Tangent. Among its many delights is the novel\u2019s acknowledgement of the fact that teachers at boarding school often seem as perplexed as the pupils as to how they came to be in such a place.</p> <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jan/24/featuresreviews.guardianreview19\">Old School by Tobias Wolff</a><br></strong>The novel opens in November 1960 after John F Kennedy has beaten Richard Nixon to the US presidency. The boys at the elite school where this novel is set all favour JFK, partly because \u201che had his clothes under control\u201d and \u201chis wife was a fox\u201d \u2013 but mainly because he \u201cread and wrote books\u201d. The highlight of every term is a visit from a Great Writer, and in our unnamed protagonist\u2019s final year, the visiting writers are Robert Frost, Ayn Rand and Ernest Hemingway, the last of whom will judge a creative writing competition. This sends the pupils into a competitive frenzy and tests the school\u2019s hardwired codes of honour to breaking point.</p> <p><strong>6. The Ruined Boys by Roy Fuller<br></strong>Gerald Bracher arrives at boarding school from South Africa after his parents\u2019 divorce. He is desperate to conform and awash with guilt at his own perceived role in their split, attaching himself worshipfully to the headmaster as a replacement father figure. The novel chronicles Gerald\u2019s transformation from eager admirer to rebellious cynic as the school\u2019s (and, by extension, society\u2019s) shortcomings become apparent. The novel is insightful and funny about boarding-school philosophy, as in the scene where Gerald is nervous about the fact that a boxing match is to be held and declares his fear that people might be murdered. \u201cPossibly,\u201d replies his interlocutor. \u201cBut they\u2019ll be murdered in a fair way.\u201d</p> <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/06/skippy-dies-paul-murray\">Skippy Dies by Paul Murray</a><br></strong>The title isn\u2019t a spoiler: Daniel \u201cSkippy\u201d Juster expires within the first few pages of this novel, in the middle of a doughnut-eating race against his friend Ruprecht Van Doren. Skippy\u2019s final act is to burst a doughnut in his fist and paint the words TELL LORI on the floor in jam. This is the jumping-off point for a riotous and digressive tale, both comic and tragic, that relates the experiences of Ruprecht and Skippy at Dublin\u2019s Seabrook College for Boys.</p> <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/sep/11/fiction.features\">Prep by Curtis Sittenfeld</a><br></strong>At 14, Lee Fiora becomes fascinated with boarding schools while researching the subject at her local public library.

Remove any dirt or barnacles that are still attached to the shells, and pull out any fibrous little beards by giving them a sharp tug towards the hinge end of the mussel.</p> <h2><strong>3 Prep the other ingredients and start cooking</strong></h2> <p>Peel and finely chop the shallots and pick the leaves from the thyme sprigs. Put these and the bay leaf in a large pan that\u2019s large enough to hold all the mussels and that you have some way of covering (if you don\u2019t have a bespoke lid, a slightly smaller pan or baking tray will do).

So far this the only confirmed case on the island.</p> <p>There is an increasing sense of urgency in Moria about hygiene and handwashing. In the absence of support from the Greek authorities, residents are taking matters into their own hands.</p> <p>\u201cThe conditions were out of control and so we knew that we needed to do something by ourselves,\u201d said Deen Mohammad Alizadah, 30, originally from Afghanistan.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/18/ngos-raise-alarm-as-coronavirus-strips-support-from-eu-refugees\">NGOs raise alarm as coronavirus strips support from EU refugees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alizadah is one of the residents who have come together to create an awareness team. \u201cThe only thing that can control the virus here is the management of people and making them aware,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The members of the team are a snapshot of the diverse population of Moria, heralding from countries such as Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea and the Congo region, each dispensing advice to their own communities. The team has already swelled to 50 people, with more joining by the day. Megaphones are being distributed to help spread the word about the importance of hygiene and washing.</p> <p>Due to high demand, face masks are currently in short supply in pharmacies in the local town of Mytilene, and since there is no current mass distribution of masks to the camp, industrious Moria residents have come up with their own solution. </p> <p>In a small building around a kilometre from Moria, a group of four Afghan women have volunteered their time to sew face masks for the camp\u2019s population. Stand By Me Lesvos, a Greek NGO, realised that they could make use of the sewing machines from a previous project. </p> <p>\u201cIt was set up within six hours on Friday,\u201d said Mixalis Avialotis from Stand By Me Lesvos. \u201cOne of the Afghan women used to be a tailor in Kabul and said she\u2019d have no problem managing the operation.\u201d </p> <p>The women are working at a rapid rate and in their first day made approximately 500 masks, which are fashioned from cotton fabric bought from local shops. The masks are then packaged into plastic wrappers purchased from the local Lidl supermarket and boxed to be brought to the camp. The masks, which will be given out for free, will initially only be distributed to camp residents who start to feel unwell or exhibit symptoms of the virus, such as a cough.</p> <p>Once worn, the masks will then be boiled and sterilised so that, if necessary, they can be reused.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d9749e779934de9a20d0241a5e1357f7a6e53e4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9749e779934de9a20d0241a5e1357f7a6e53e4c/0_0_960_1280/750.jpg\" alt=\"Posters made by children in the overcrowded Vathy refugee camp on Samos.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Posters made by children in the Vathy refugee camp on Samos are part of an effort to combat overcrowded and unhygienic conditions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Still I Rise NGO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Avialotis estimates that they have now made around 1,500 masks and said that social distancing and other Covid-19-mitigating measures have also been implemented inside the factory.\u201c</p> <p>On the island of Samos where the refugee camp hosts nearly 7,500 people in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/13/greek-refugee-camp-for-640-people-found-housing-3745-eu\">space designed for 648</a>, conditions are similarly cramped. Huddled on a hill above the town of Samos, the island\u2019s capital, washing facilities are scarce. Around 400 of the thousands of people living here are unaccompanied minors, some of whom have already have skin conditions such as chronic scabies due to poor sanitary conditions.</p> <p>Guilia Cicoli, co-founder of Still I Rise NGO, which runs a youth centre for children living in Vathy camp, told the Guardian that they had spent a lot of time speaking to the children about Covid-19. The children have also produced posters about hand washing and hygiene in class.</p> <p>\u201cMost of us are Italians so we took it very seriously and started awareness raising before Greece even had any confirmed cases,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore we had to close last week we had already replaced handshakes with elbow or feet bumps.\u201d</p> <p>Movement on the Ground, a Dutch NGO, started taping dispensers of hand sanitiser to olive trees in Samos last week to encourage residents to regularly wash their hands in the dusty and dirty conditions.</p> <p>The impending threat of the virus has pushed some camp residents from Moria to seek refuge on the mainland. The Guardian knows of a number of them, some with sick family members, who decided that they could not wait for a UNHCR-organised ferry to the mainland and made their own way Athens last week after the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in Lesbos.</p> <p>This decision has left them without access to accommodation and any state provision. Yet for the families, leaving the camps seems like the safer option as many see a Covid-19 outbreak there as inevitable.</p>",
  "<p>New Zealand has passed a landmark bill to decriminalise abortion after decades of campaigning.</p> <p>Andrew Little, the justice minister, said it was long overdue that the procedure would become classified as a health matter and not a criminal one.</p> <p>The issue was scheduled to be put to a public referendum, but the government scrapped that option late on Wednesday.</p> <p>\u201cFor over 40 years, abortion has been the only medical procedure considered a crime in New Zealand. But from now abortions will be rightly treated as a health issue,\u201d Little said in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cThe previous law required a women seeking an abortion to go through many hoops. That resulted in delays to access a procedure, and that was less safe. The changes agreed to by parliament will better ensure women get advice and treatment in a more timely way.\u201d</p> <p>Key elements of the bill that passed through parliament included removing abortion from the Crimes Act, allowing women to choose abortion up to 20 weeks after consultation with a GP, and promoting counselling options for women choosing an abortion.</p> <p>Terry Bellamak, the director of Alranz Abortion Rights Aotearoa, celebrated the move, saying it heralded a progressive step forward for New Zealand.</p> <p>\u201cFinally the New Zealand parliament has brought abortion legislation into the 21st century \u2013 it only took 44 years,\u201d Bellamak said. \u201cFinally after 44 years, New Zealand parliament has recognised that women have bodily autonomy \u2013 and that is huge. Being able to control one\u2019s fertility is key to one\u2019s life \u2013 it is hard to see how we could achieve equality without that.\u201d</p> <p>Previously under New Zealand law, abortion was allowed only in cases of incest, \u201cmental subnormality\u201d or foetal abnormality, or where the physical or mental health of the mother was at serious risk. Other factors that were taken into consideration but were not grounds in themselves included \u201csexual violation\u201d and \u201cextremes of age\u201d. </p> <p>Jail terms of up to 14 years for those who procured a termination were possible under the Crimes Act, but the law was never enforced and women who underwent abortions were not liable for prosecution. But Little said the change was nevertheless needed. </p>",
  "<p>Vietnam\u2019s prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, has asked the country\u2019s agriculture ministry to draft a directive to stop illegal trading and consumption of wildlife over fears it spreads disease.</p> <p>The directive, seen as a victory for animal rights organisations, will lead to a clamping down on street-side markets dotted across the country, increase prosecutions of online traders and ideally put pressure on thousands of farms with known links to illegal wildlife trading.</p> <p>Vitenam\u2019s move to ban the wildlife trade follows similar moves by the Chinese government, after the new coronavirus pandemic appeared to have emerged from a wet market in Wuhan.</p> <p>Both illegal and \u201clegal\u201d wildlife trading <a href=\"https://env4wildlife.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/WCB-2019-No.2-Nov-18-2019.pdf\">flourishes in Vietnam</a>, where the trade has grown into a billion-dollar industry. There are thousands of markets around the country, many of which include stalls selling animals for food or as pets. Anyone walking around some of the street-side stalls of the Mekong delta can see fish tanks stuffed with sea turtles or skinned-alive frogs.</p> <p>There is also a thriving online trade in animals. Many sellers advertise on Facebook, uploading photos of leopard cats caught in mesh nets, dead pangolins stored in a freezer, slaughtered macaque monkeys, frozen tiger cubs, butchered bats or even freshly barbecued wildlife. They are bought as status symbols, pets, food, or to be used in traditional medicines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f432efb33cc794b7693f5ee45edaa25958a0015f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f432efb33cc794b7693f5ee45edaa25958a0015f/0_0_3264_2230/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pangolins smuggled from Laos and found in a bus in Vietnam\u2019s Ha Tinh province.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"683\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pangolins smuggled from Laos and found in a bus in Vietnam\u2019s Ha Tinh province.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet the largest issue in terms of Vietnam\u2019s wildlife trade is the nation\u2019s \u201clegal\u201d commercial farms, where you can see maltreated civets in metal cages or an array of rare reptiles. Across Vietnam, bears are still trapped in tiny cages on bear bile farms, while Nghe An province in central Vietnam is known for tiger farms.</p> <p>\u201cOpportunistic farmers can legally acquire licences for a plethora of species. Some of these species are incredibly difficult to raise in captivity while others are not economically viable to raise and sell profitably, but it has not been a common practice to involve third parties in the process of licensing farms, so the authorities are issuing permits to trade native species that can only be sourced from the wild,\u201d Douglas Hendrie, director of enforcement for local environment NGO <a href=\"https://env4wildlife.org/\">Education for Nature Vietnam</a> (ENV) told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cAdditionally, in some cases farmers can get away with trading completely protected species which are not even allowed to be farmed due to authorities lacking education on species protection. With such a poorly regulated and enforced commercial wildlife farming industry few fear prosecution.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/18/tip-of-the-iceberg-is-our-destruction-of-nature-responsible-for-covid-19-aoe\">'Tip of the iceberg': is our destruction of nature responsible for Covid-19?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAnimals from these farms and \u2018conservation\u2019 facilities are then sold via a huge \u2018legal\u2019 industry to businessmen, restaurants, traditional medicine shops and even across the border into China,\u201d Hendrie added.</p> <p>On 20 November, Vietnamese authorities investigated a wildlife farm and temporarily seized 57 animals from 19 different species, the Guardian has learned. In this case, the owner was caught in possession of more than 10 species protected by law \u2013 a criminal offence punishable by up to 15 years in prison. It is this diversity of species \u2013 as seen in Wuhan\u2019s wet market \u2013 that can lead to the spread of disease.</p> <p>According to Hendrie, online trading has grown in appeal as sellers can hide their identity while reaching more buyers. Entire Facebook pages are dedicated to ivory, rhino horns and bear claws or posting photos of animals being caught or slaughtered. Last year ENV recorded more than 2,400 advertisements in violation of wildlife protection laws on Facebook, YouTube, Zalo and other online platforms, along with more than 600 people caught illegally possessing wildlife.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f714c26cabddd56c126f218c097bcc1c3737135c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f714c26cabddd56c126f218c097bcc1c3737135c/0_175_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"There is a thriving online trade in animals such as macaque monkeys (pictured), tiger cubs, bats or even freshly barbecued wildlife.

  "<p>Beijing has defended its decision to expel journalists from three major US publications, saying it was responding to \u201cunreasonable oppression\u201d of Chinese journalists in the US, as a diplomatic row escalates between the two countries.</p> <p>Speaking at a regular press briefing, the foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Beijing had been \u201ccompelled\u201d to take countermeasures after Washington imposed restrictions on staff at Chinese state media outlets in the US.</p> <p>\u201cWe urge the US to take off its ideological prejudice, abandon cold war mentality,\u201d Geng said. \u201cChina is not one to start trouble, but it will not blink if trouble comes. We urge the US side to immediately stop suppressing Chinese media, otherwise the US side will lose even more.\u201d</p> <p>At least 13 journalists will be expelled in what is an unprecedented retaliation against foreign media working in the country. An announcement made just after midnight said all US journalists working for the New York Times, Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal whose credentials were up for renewal this year would have 10 days to turn in their press cards, a measure that effectively bans them from reporting in the country.</p> <p>China has said it is responding to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/18/us-chinese-media-propaganda-state-department\">US move last month</a> to classify Chinese state media organisations as foreign missions and tighten controls on them.

As China struggles to return to normal in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, which killed more than 3,000 people in mainland China, it has pushed the idea that the virus may have originated in the US. Donald Trump has continued to call Covid-19 the \u201cChinese virus\u201d.</p> <p>Analysts said the expulsion of foreign correspondents, many of whom have exposed issues such as re-education camps in Xinjiang or authorities\u2019 mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, is indicative of an emboldened Beijing.

It can have a chilling effect on the journalists that remain,\u201d she said<strong>.</strong></p> <p>According to a statement from the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club of China (FCCC), more journalists may be affected, depending on how broadly China enforces the ban. \u201cJournalists illuminate the world we live in. China, through this action, is dimming itself,\u201d it said in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cBy expelling journalists and keeping others in a state of visa uncertainty, China is overtly using its powers in an attempt to influence overseas news coverage, by punishing those who publish information authorities see as unfavourable and wish to keep quiet.\u201d</p> <p>Dean Baquet, the executive editor of the New York Times, said China had made a \u201cgrave mistake\u201d and urged the two governments to resolve the dispute quickly. \u201cWe strongly condemn the decision of the Chinese authorities to expel American journalists, an action that is especially irresponsible at a time when the world needs the free and open flow of credible information about the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Matt Murray, the Wall Street Journal editor-in-chief, called it an \u201cunprecedented attack on freedom of the press\u201d at a time of crisis. \u201cTrusted news reporting from and about China has never been more important. We oppose government interference with a free press anywhere in the world. Our commitment to reporting fully and deeply on China is unchanged.\u201d</p> <p>The Washington Post\u2019s executive editor, Marty Baron, said: \u201cWe unequivocally condemn any action by China to expel US reporters. The Chinese government\u2019s decision is particularly regrettable because it comes in the midst of an unprecedented global crisis, when clear and reliable information about the international response to Covid-19 is essential. Severely limiting the flow of that information, which China now seeks to do, only aggravates the situation.\u201d</p> <p>The New York Times newspaper\u2019s board said in an editorial that China\u2019s crackdown was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/opinion/china-journalists-coronavirus.html\">an unfortunate echo of the cold war</a>, and it couldn\u2019t come at a worse time.

  "<h2>\u2018Will our league survive?\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019m a member of a League of Ireland football club. We are one of the better known clubs in the country and have a fair few season tickets. That is not the case for other clubs. Some are trying to stay afloat, especially in the country\u2019s second tier. Matchdays are obviously big earners, whether that be tickets, food or drink. Some clubs can only budget day-to-day, with these influxes every fortnight keeping their heads above water. What happens when clubs have to go without this for a month \u2013 or even a whole season? How can they afford to play players without taking money in the gate?</p> <p>What has happened in the FAI, our national football association, has been well documented. The situation before the outbreak of Covid-19 was one of uncertainty. With everything already up in the air, can our league \u2013 especially smaller clubs, who are already teetering on the brink \u2013 survive a season with no fans, no football, and no funding?</p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m disappointed with how Chelsea dealt with this\u2019</h2> <p>I booked to go to Munich for Chelsea\u2019s game in the Champions League this week.

They immediately took the five loyalty points away and will refund the \u00a353 ticket (let\u2019s see if the booking fee is included) in 10 days. Ten days! United said they would do it in three. I was planning to go home to see my mum in Leicester for Mother\u2019s Day and take her to Chelsea\u2019s game there in the FA Cup. Now I\u2019ll be stuck with family and no football.

I hope mine is not one of those, but I would be amazed if there are not at least a few clubs for whom this could be the end. <em><strong>Michael</strong></em></p> <h2>\u2018We were having an incredible season\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019m living in northern Italy at the moment in the town of Riva del Garda. I play for the local rugby team, Rugby Benacense, and we were having an incredible season. So far, we are unbeaten and have two more games left of the regular season before the playoffs. Unfortunately, the league has been suspended indefinitely and no training has taken place since 25 February. It\u2019s a shame that the season has just came to a halt, but I support the measures to try to reduce the risk of the virus spreading. <em><strong>Harjan</strong></em></p> <h2>\u2018I have to accept it is a part of life\u2019</h2> <p>I started training for the Manchester marathon at the beginning of December and it has now been cancelled. After training for the last 15 weeks, with just three weeks left to go, I\u2019m now thinking about what can I do instead. Do I run my own marathon at my goal pace so not to waste my training? How do I go about keeping my fitness up without needing to repeat the 18-week training plan for when it is rescheduled? Will I be able to attend the new date? Then there is the potential for monetary loss from travel tickets, accommodation and entry fee. There is nothing I can do and I have to accept it is a part of life that unfortunate events disrupt even the best laid plans, but you cannot help but feel frustrated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"188d0bf99f55c555a6f38c7c49bb5713481c1777\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/188d0bf99f55c555a6f38c7c49bb5713481c1777/0_0_3500_2290/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mo Farah running in Manchester.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"654\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mo Farah competing in Manchester.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018We are in national lockdown\u2019</h2> <p>I coach rugby in Italy and work with grassroots clubs, helping them develop their business, especially with regards to sponsors and community connections. Rugby has come to a stop here, with all activities suspended and clubs closed. Clubs are now in lockdown, which is having an enormous impact on their finances. We\u2019re waiting to hear the future for this year\u2019s Top 12 championship \u2013 will it be be cancelled, postponed or will there be some other creative solution?</p> <p>On a bright side, lots of coaches are being very creative and giving kids rugby homework such as stories to write, pictures to draw, problems to solve, quizzes and opportunities to explore rugby\u2019s core values. Anything to keep them busy and thinking about rugby. We\u2019re in national lockdown and housebound except in order to shop for food and medicine. Very strange times!</p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m worried we won\u2019t be able to see the game or even visit Liverpool\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019m a lifelong Liverpool fan. I\u2019ve been waiting for a season like this all my life. I\u2019ve never had the chance to see them play at Anfield. At the start of the season, me and a bunch of friends got tickets for Liverpool\u2019s last game at Anfield against Chelsea. We have booked a hotel and flights. Right now I\u2019m very worried that it will all be for nothing and we won\u2019t be able to see the game or even visit Liverpool. I think I might have some dust in my eyes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/17/football-brazil-coronavirus-pandemic-continues\">'Will we have to strike?' Football in Brazil continues despite coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>\u2018It would be my first time in Italy\u2019</h2> <p>Just a couple days before the outbreak arrived in Europe, I made plans with a friend to go to Italy on a football-themed weekend. It would be my first time in the country and I was going to attend two matches in a day: Atalanta v Lazio and Inter v Brescia. I could not have chosen a worst region. <em><strong>Leonardo</strong></em></p> <h2>\u2018Suddenly it dawns on you\u2019</h2> <p>I am the chairman of a small rugby club in London. At first you go about your business thinking this does not require any response from you or the club and suddenly it dawns on you. Simple things like, how do we ensure we have enough soap and hand sanitiser when all the shops seem empty of them? Our small budget cannot stand too many deep cleans.</p> <p>We are in our regional vase final in the middle of April. There will be three matches so approaching 200 players and officials sharing changing rooms, plus potentially hundreds of supporters in the bar. Will that go ahead? What about our end-of-season tour? We are not a wealthy club. We cannot afford to hire a coach and then have that postponed.</p> <p>How do we monitor our own players \u2013 let alone the opposition? How do we know if someone has been in contact with someone who has been affected by the virus? Our players are young, fit and healthy (though looking at some of our front rows you might wonder) but quite a few work at the nearby airport where there is a higher risk of contact.</p> <p>Suddenly, retiring and giving your time to help out at a community club becomes a little more serious than just doing a shift behind the bar. It becomes about doing your best, with little professional advice, to protect the bunch of people who rely on their club as part of what they do.</p> <h2>\u2018It could be a long time before I am back in a stadium\u2019</h2> <p>I have a season ticket at Arsenal and was told on 3 March that I should not go to crowded places until the number of cases in England starts to fall. I\u2019m 34 and I have cystic fibrosis. Catching coronavirus at a match (or anywhere) would be an absolute disaster for me because my lungs are already compromised due to low lung function.</p> <p>I have no choice but to following the medical advice. The bigger picture isn\u2019t great either. With no coronavirus vaccine on the horizon for another 12 months or more, I\u2019m starting to accept that it could be a really long time before I am back in a stadium again. The risks will remain high until there\u2019s a vaccine.</p> <h2>\u2018Health is bigger than any sporting event\u2019</h2> <p>I live in Michigan and follow European football very closely. Seeing all these leagues being postponed and held behind closed doors is insane. I don\u2019t think anyone has ever really lived through something like this, so the precaution is necessary. As much as I love this sport, unfortunately this is the right call. The coronavirus has shown us all that health is bigger than any sporting event and that taking precautions early can help stop the virus from spreading rapidly.</p> <p>I will miss spending my weekend mornings watching football. All anyone can hope for is the wellbeing of the people affected, that authorities control the spread and find a possible vaccine. Until then football will be missed by millions. Hopefully leagues will be able to finish their seasons in the near future. <em><strong>Diana</strong></em></p> <h2>\u2018I have been planning a month-long trip to Italy\u2019</h2> <p>I have been planning a month-long trip to Italy during April and May to watch Inter, Bologna, Fiorentina and Napoli play. Given everything that is happening, I suspect my trip might be a non-starter. I have tickets a train to Turin and three games, but have no idea if I\u2019ll be able to get my money back. <em><strong>Ben</strong></em></p> <h2>\u2018Having the chance to see us away in Europe again was exciting\u2019</h2> <p>I had planned to go and see Rangers in Germany against Leverkusen. I have had an extremely tough year as I had a liver transplant last August. For the majority of this season I have followed Rangers from the couch as I have been recovering, but having the chance to see us away in Europe again was exciting! I am devastated. I will just have to hope Rangers can get into the next round.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7c466dace8da67fe957ce274a99e4df300bf223\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7c466dace8da67fe957ce274a99e4df300bf223/0_62_3876_2475/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rangers are in the last 16 in the Europa League.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"639\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rangers are in the last 16 in the Europa League.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Octavio Passos/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018My dad decided to go abroad for the first time in his life\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019m from Poland and have been planning a trip to London with my son and my dad, who made the decision to go abroad for the first time in his entire life. As he\u2019s football fan I decided to take him to the Millwall v Swansea game to experience some old school British football atmosphere. Due to the Covid-19 outbreak we have been forced to cancel the whole trip. We\u2019ve lost money on plane tickets and accommodation, so I hope to get refund on game tickets at least. <em><strong>Konrad</strong></em></p> <h2>\u2018My fantasy Six Nations league has been completely upended\u2019</h2> <p>It\u2019s not as high stakes as a lot of other sports fans I\u2019m sure, but my fantasy Six Nations league has been completely upended as a result of coronavirus. We had organised a fairly big prize at the end and now none of us can decide how we can resolve it.</p>",
  "<p>It is the fate of Lazio supporters, according to the Italian voice actor Pino Insegno, to \u201csuffer even in those moments when we were not supposed to\u201d. The Biancocelesti were enjoying one of their finest seasons prior to the coronavirus outbreak, sitting one point off the top of Serie A at the moment when games were suspended. They are undefeated in the league since September, and beat the leaders, Juventus, twice in December.</p> \n<p>Football, as Insegno was quick to remind listeners to the Roman station Radiosei last week, is of secondary importance at a time when Italy is on lockdown. \u201cWe need to stay home, and that\u2019s it,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe have not lived through a moment like this since the war.\u201d Still, it is a curious quirk of fate that Lazio \u2013 champions of Italy just twice in their history \u2013 were denied a shot at a title on the only previous occasion when football was suspended mid-season on the peninsula.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/14/angelo-ogbonna-accuses-premier-league-ignoring-coronavirus-risk\">Angelo Ogbonna accuses Premier League of \u2018ignoring\u2019 coronavirus risk</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It was war that thwarted them in 1915. No single top division existed back then, but rather a series of regional tournaments. The season was supposed to culminate in a grand final between the champions of the north and the best of the rest. Those plans were shelved after Italy entered the first world war in May, prompting the national football federation (FIGC) to suspend play.</p> \n<p>Lazio had already progressed through a regional sub-section and then won a mini-league between the top four teams from central Italy. All that separated them from the grand final was a knock-out tie against the champions of the south. But that match never took place. </p> \n<p>Instead, the Scudetto lay vacant for four years before, according to Gazzetta dello Sport, the FIGC issued a resolution awarding it to Genoa in 1919. The Rossoblu had been <a href=\"https://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Serie-A/Genoa/21-02-2020/scudetto-ipotecato-genoa-99-anni-lazio-reclama-3601130199715.shtml\">top of the northern section</a> at the time when the leagues were suspended, with one game still to play.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c9b20c45-fe7e-40fc-bc93-679d828e8f24\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A nation in post-war recovery barely noticed. Another two years would pass before Gazzetta \u2013 acting as an official mouthpiece for the federation \u2013 arranged a small dinner ceremony to present Genoa with their title. Almost a century later, that act is still under dispute. </p> \n<p>This February, a lawyer named Gian Luca Mignogna presented fresh documents to the FIGC, asserting that their own regulations from the era should have prohibited the title from being awarded in such a manner. He has argued for it to be shared between Genoa and Lazio instead. A petition supporting him <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/spettabile-federazione-italiana-gioco-calcio-lazio-1914-15-campione-d-italia-ex-aequo\">on change.org</a> has drawn more than 35,000 signatures.</p> \n<p>In truth, Lazio were not the only ones with a right to feel aggrieved. Genoa\u2019s remaining game in the northern section would have been against Torino, who lay within overtaking distance and had beaten them 6-1 in their previous head-to-head. Inter, in third, were not mathematically out of the running either.</p> \n<p>The picture was less clear in the southern section, with a deciding game between Naples and Internazionale Napoli reportedly annulled due to an irregularity with player registrations. In theory, Lazio still needed to overcome the winner of that tie to qualify for the grand final.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78b373dd4e65baf05fc8133ae030e0e0e13ece1f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78b373dd4e65baf05fc8133ae030e0e0e13ece1f/0_347_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Lazio president, Claudio Lotito, leaves an emergency FIGC meeting in Rome.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Lazio president, Claudio Lotito, leaves an emergency FIGC meeting in Rome.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alberto Lingria/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Northern teams were manifestly dominant in this period. Lazio had reached the previous two finals only to get thumped on both occasions: losing 6-0 to Pro Vercelli at a neutral venue in 1913, then 9-1 to Casale over two legs a year later. After the war, teams representing the north went on to win every Scudetto until the formation of a single national top division in 1926.</p> \n<p>Such outcomes were no accident. In an era before professionalism, teams from wealthier cities were often able to recruit more effectively with the help of friendly local businesses that lured players with the promise of comfortable employment. Some had more direct means. Two Genoa players were banned for life in 1913 after being caught trying to pay in substantial cheques signed by their club\u2019s president, though those suspensions were eventually overturned.</p> \n<p>Much has changed over the course of a century, yet the fact that the FIGC are still dealing with the fallout from 1915 might be a salutary lesson for football\u2019s governing bodies as they consider how to proceed today. The federation\u2019s president, Gabriele Gravina, last week outlined four options for Serie A to proceed once quarantine restrictions are lifted.</p> \n<p>The first, preferred solution, would see all the games being completed on a delayed schedule (perhaps even, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/16/italy-considers-splitting-2019-20-serie-a-campaign-over-two-seasons\">he suggested on Monday</a>, by splitting the games across two seasons). If that is not possible, then the league will either need to declare this season vacant, set the current standings as final or hold some form of play-off for the top positions and relegation.</p> \n<p>None of those options would be universally popular, and tensions between clubs with competing interests are rising. Lazio\u2019s president, Claudio Lotito, is reported to have argued with his Juventus counterpart, Andrea Agnelli, during a conference call on Friday over the prospect of players returning to training before the country\u2019s lockdown is lifted.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/16/the-doors-have-closed-on-la-liga-just-like-front-doors-all-over-spain\">The doors have closed on La Liga, just like front doors all over Spain</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In the midst of a pandemic with a rising death toll, the hope must be that all parties can find a common ground that places public health as the greatest priority. But it is clear that for some people, at least, the scars of 1915 are yet to heal.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe fear is that the current season will come to the same end as the one interrupted by the Great War, and, just like back then, the interruption will become an occasion to deny Lazio the recognition of a Scudetto won on the pitch,\u201d wrote Lazio\u2019s head of communications, Arturo Diaconale, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/arturo.diaconale/photos/a.292228430951889/1472447532929967/?type=3&amp;theater\">in a long Facebook post</a> on 9 March, shortly before Serie A was suspended.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis syndrome of the denied title from 1915 is spreading almost as much as the epidemic from China. Because it releases that old fear that, in a situation of maximum uncertainty provoked by a health emergency paralysing our country, the interests of the big clubs can be turned to the damage of the Biancocelesti.\u201d</p> \n<p>His crass (and, bluntly, incorrect) framing drew condemnation even from many of his own followers. Diaconale <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/arturo.diaconale/posts/1474209332753787?__xts__[0]=68.ARCXkRB0IEwsWOl2yZjoSpDTv1Jx4vvnjhdKzUtx3GutWIa8td8AqZk-1NDIfdmxX0814TYmiZV_U6Q91KXtScerxdhu4yhlYldyvhH1kcpaTtDAJfcgH5tuyPPHKku8YOk04b4_6JrWZ3-WGuPEkpgO0syQ3AlYgX4SiCnuGHDcvb9W8Zo0x6r7DGHoTOHV7kGqyS5izjllzlXD1zpn5PnI1VhRkGVF7ciKk7pydeo02_JzLR_RE4TY3pct7co0m01jcj-GH97ZXSeyi9uW5IleMC3vLHrdWBC5XLlbHREfdZLJ_0hiSNFe16Ja3dzGDskTnS39vzR7R3MpstINQg&amp;__tn__=-R\">followed up with a clarification</a> two days later that his social media posts represented only his own views rather than those of the club or Lotito.</p> \n<p>There are plenty of Lazio supporters, though, who share at least some part of his sentiment. Their team has played brilliantly this season, mounting its most compelling title challenge since 2001. No conspiracy theories are required to understand why a fanbase might feel frustration at the prospect of seeing a great season end without resolution for the second time in their history, due to events beyond anyone\u2019s control.</p>",

its release: </p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>In these unprecedented and challenging times, BaptistCare have taken precautions to prioritise the safety and health of our residents, families and staff.</p> \n   <p>Older Australians are especially vulnerable to this virus, and it is vital we take additional measures to protect our residents and staff as the transmission of COVID-19 continues to escalate in the community.</p> \n   <p><strong>This is a preventative measure only and there is currently no other case of COVID-19 at any other BaptistCare home.</strong></p> \n   <p> The preventative closure to all visitors means:</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <ul> \n    <li>BaptistCare residential aged care homes <strong>will not be allowing casual and non-essential access </strong>(including families, friends, school groups).</li> \n    <li>Visits from essential services such as GPs and allied health providers will continue as per normal. </li> \n    <li>Residents will be requested to remain in our homes, with any residents who need to leave being required to isolate in their rooms on return for 7 days.</li> \n    <li>All recreational and lifestyle programs as well as chapel services at each Home will continue as long as the Home remains free of COVID-19, with social distancing measures in place as further prevention.</li> \n   </ul> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p> We are assessing this developing situation in an ongoing way, and we will advise residents and families as soon as anything changes.</p> \n   <p> We understand how difficult this will be for many of our families, and even for our residents who look forward to visits from their loved ones, however we appreciate all cooperation at this time as we do all we can to protect our residents and staff.</p> \n   <p> While we do not know exactly what is to come with this pandemic situation, we do know that the safety and health of our residents, staff and the wider community, are our ongoing

day.<br></p> \n  <p>Anyone who has been overseas in the past two weeks, been in contact with someone who has coronavirus or respiratory infection symptoms will be barred completely.<br></p> \n  <p>The

non-essential indoor gatherings of more than 100 people.</p> \n  <p>An email from Estia chief executive <strong>Ian Thornley</strong> to family and friends of residents said its facilities would close to visitors from 5pm on Wednesday.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe understand that this decision will have significant impact on our residents and their close contacts and sincerely apologise for this,\u201d he

That includes its mosques in Cabramatta, Young and Lakemba, one of Australia\u2019s largest mosques that hosts thousands of people every week. It is encouraging prayer at home. Additional activities and the night prayer during Ramadan will also be suspended. Religious counselling and other services will be offered online and over the phone.</li> \n   <li>The Anglican archbishop of Sydney, Glenn Davies, says the Anglican church in Sydney will suspend all church gatherings until further notice. He is encouraging churches to provide their services and sermons online or via other communication methods. Easter services will not take place and he will record a video of a Good Friday and Easter Sunday sermon.</li> \n   <li>Sydney synagogues have also suspended services after a recommendation from the Sydney Beth Din. In a statement, issued on Tuesday, a day before the government\u2019s announcement of the new restrictions, the authority said there was no time to waste and recommended gatherings including weddings and funerals also be limited to immediate family.</li> \n   <li>The Permanent Committee of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference was meeting today to determine its response.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T06:38:19.172Z\">at 6.38am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e71c07c8f085c6327bc209f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T06:33:29.346Z\">6.33am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Saudi Arabia has called an online G20 summit for next week, to help G20 nations build a \u201ccoordinated response\u201d to the hit to the global economy.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T06:34:55.505Z\">at 6.34am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e71c00e8f088d757559577c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T06:31:05.419Z\">6.31am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Some good news (hopefully) for those working from home:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>To support productivity and connectivity in response to COVID-19 social distancing measures, NBN Co has cleared the way for RSPs to meet the changing needs of their customers.

  "<p>Naima Said stands back and studies her handiwork. \u201cNot quite,\u201d the self-taught beauty therapist mumbles, her forehead furrowed in frustration. Then she delicately dabs her client\u2019s eyelid with a squishy makeup sponge. She\u2019s not finished yet.</p> <p>Several years ago Said, 31, used YouTube videos to train herself in everything from dying hair to pedicures. Now she runs the Beauty Corner \u2013 a small but perfectly formed parlour in Mombasa on the Kenyan coast. Every weekday at 8am, she lays out her equipment and waits for women to walk through the door. Like Said, those who seek out her services are addicted to heroin, or in recovery.</p> <p>Housed in the Reachout Centre Trust, a Kenyan organisation that helps Mombasa residents to fight drug addiction, the parlour opened last year with the aim of attracting more female users to its services, which include HIV testing, counselling, methadone treatment and cervical cancer screening.</p> <p>Said was a heroin user for 10 years. After her father ran out of money to pay for private school, she was at a loose end, she says. Aged 17, she started smoking marijuana with her friends. By 21, she was a \u201cfull=blown\u201d heroin addict.</p> <p>\u201cI was half-dead, half-alive,\u201d she says. \u201cI started selling sex to pay for my next hit. On the streets, you need to look beautiful but I looked dirty. I was a junkie. People would see me and get scared.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2ed126241fcd83a2ea76cb26629905818549fdf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2ed126241fcd83a2ea76cb26629905818549fdf/0_0_3589_2691/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth Yieko, a former addict\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elizabeth Yieko, 34, a former addict, gets her hair done.

Since 2010, however, heroin use has increased faster across the continent than anywhere else in the world, according to the 2017 <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/wdr2017/field/Booklet_3_Plantbased_drugs.pdf\">report</a> of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).</p> <p> There are two reasons. First, despite the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/09/how-the-heroin-trade-explains-the-us-uk-failure-in-afghanistan\">billions of pounds</a> spent by the US and its allies to curb the production of opium poppies in Afghanistan, the amount grown has seen an \u201calmost continuous rise\u201d, says Simone Haysom of the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organised Crime (GIATO).</p> <p>In 2017, opium cultivation reached a record high (jumping <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2017/11/636182-afghanistan-opium-production-jumps-87-cent-record-level-un-survey\">87%</a> in one year). It has since fallen by 20% but Afghanistan still produces 82% of the world\u2019s heroin.</p> <p>Second, Africa has become an attractive drug transit route. Historically, most of the heroin trafficked to the west from Afghanistan came overland via the \u201cBalkan route\u201d. But after conflict and increased security made this path trickier to navigate, according to a <a href=\"https://enact-africa.s3.amazonaws.com/site/uploads/2018-07-02-tackling-heroin-trafficking-policy-brief.pdf\">report</a> by the GIATO, smugglers took to the seas.</p> <p>Since 2010 the \u201csouthern route\u201d \u2013 also known as the \u201csmack track\u201d \u2013 has grown in popularity; heroin is trafficked from Afghanistan via the Indian Ocean into east and South Africa. From there it makes its way to Europe, Asia and North America. As more heroin has washed into east Africa, more people have become hooked.</p> <p>\u201cInstead of the drug just moving through the region, the region itself is now a destination,\u201d says Haysom.</p> <p>In 2017, the UNODC <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/wdr2017/field/Booklet_3_Plantbased_drugs.pdf\"> said</a> heroin addiction appeared to be on the rise in Kenya, particularly along the coast. As east Africa\u2019s largest port, Mombasa has borne the brunt of this increase, but usage has spread to other areas, including Nairobi and Kiambu county. Data is patchy, but it is estimated that between<a href=\"http://www.aidsinfoonline.org/kpatlas/document/KEN/KEN_2012_PSE_Report_FSW_MSM_PWID.pdf\"> 18,000</a> and <a href=\"https://enact-africa.s3.amazonaws.com/site/uploads/2018-07-02-tackling-heroin-trafficking-policy-brief.pdf\">55,000</a> Kenyans use heroin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aea02ebfb246e54c8e71aed5a9428a62d665ca50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aea02ebfb246e54c8e71aed5a9428a62d665ca50/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heroin users prepare their fix  in Lamu, Kenya\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heroin users prepare their fix in Lamu, Kenya.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Goran Toma\u0161evi\u0107/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While help is available at more than 50 registered treatment and rehabilitation centres across the country, rehabilitation is rarely free. Women are falling through the cracks.</p> <p>\u201cFemale drug users have very specific needs,\u201d says Faiza Hamid, Reachout\u2019s programme manager, \u201cand their needs aren\u2019t being met.\u201d</p> <p>A key problem is stigma: <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/women-using-heroin-in-kenya-why-its-important-to-intervene-early-in-life-122470\">many</a> participate in sex work to fund their drug habit (a single heroin dose costs between 150-200 Kenyan shillings, roughly \u00a31.50) and this prevents them from accessing treatment. Concerns about childcare, hard-to-reach treatment centres and <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/documents/wdr2015/World_Drug_Report_2015.pdf\">relationship issues</a> \u2013 the women often live with a partner with their own substance problem \u2013 also stop many coming forward for help.</p> <p>If women do seek out treatment, they are likely to drop out faster, and experience higher risks of <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/documents/wdr2015/World_Drug_Report_2015.pdf\">HIV infection</a>. Women constitute the minority of users, but experts say that the numbers on female drug use are underreported and likely to be much higher.</p> <p>At the same time, there is a clear lack of services tailored to women\u2019s needs and the majority of rehabilitation centres are aimed at men. While research on female drug addicts in Kenya is limited, <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/documents/wdr2015/World_Drug_Report_2015.pdf\">studies</a> have indicated that women enrolled in gender-specific treatment programmes have better outcomes and improvement than those who are not, according to the UNODC.</p> <p>That is where the Beauty Corner comes in. \u201cI talk to these girls,\u201d says Said, Reachout\u2019s first female methadone patient, who was chosen by the clinic\u2019s director to manage the parlour after attending counselling sessions.

  "<p>An old man and a dog sit on the moss-covered roof of a log cabin in the Canadian wilderness. It is a warm summer\u2019s night \u2013 a river gurgles nearby. The man, named Thornton, and the dog, named Buck, have been on a long journey to reach this bucolic splendor, a journey that is now coming to an end. Buck has met a pack of wolves in the forest and is overcome by a primal urge to rejoin his ancestors. Thornton is despondent at the prospect of losing his friend. So, in one final act of submission, Buck nestles into Thornton\u2019s lap, before he turns his back on domestication and returns to his own kind.</p> <p>This is a scene in the recent cinematic remake of Jack London\u2019s 1903 novel The Call of the Wild, which tracks the journey of Buck, a highborn St Bernard collie cross. There have been several attempts at reimagining this tale in film: in 1935, a hulking St Bernard starred alongside Clark Gable in the first movie version of the novel. In 1972, Charlton Heston shared the screen with Buck the leonberger.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/gallery/2020/feb/02/hollywood-hounds-canine-film-stars-in-pictures\">Hollywood hounds: canine film stars \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the most recent iteration of The Call of the Wild, directed by Chris Sanders, Harrison Ford takes the role of Thornton \u2013 but no dog appears on the film credits. In fact, if you were on set during shooting for the scene at the log cabin, you would see Ford, looking forlorn and rugged, and there, nestling in his lap, a fully grown man named Terry wearing a mo-cap suit.</p> <p>This is because the role of Buck has been outsourced to CGI. Of course, this animation technique has been used in Hollywood for a long time to animate, with striking realism, creatures that otherwise belong only in fiction. The dinosaurs of Jurassic Park. The super intelligent primates in the Planet of the Apes.</p> <p>In this movie, however, computer graphics are used to replace a figure that has played an outsized, though often unacknowledged, role in film history \u2013 the dog actor. At what cost?</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>The history of dogs in cinema is as old as cinema itself. In the Lumi\u00e8re brothers\u2019 pioneering 1895 film Workers Leaving the Lumi\u00e8re Factory in Lyon<em>,</em> a joyful mastiff bounds into frame 20 seconds through the 46-second-long reel, completely oblivious to having become part of movie history. This unexpected performance signals the uncontrolled, chaotic conditions under which directors first produced films, which is again demonstrated in the Lumi\u00e8re brothers\u2019 1897 Le Faux cul-de-jatte, in which a stray dog wonders on to the set, lifts his leg and urinates at the film\u2019s pinnacle moment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"12538be8bf146f803714b9b46a82acdcbb6a2bed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12538be8bf146f803714b9b46a82acdcbb6a2bed/22_0_1450_2048/708.jpg\" alt=\"Owner Lee Duncan holding Rin Tin Tin.\" width=\"708\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Owner Lee Duncan holding Rin Tin Tin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bill Bridges/The Life Images Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the movie industry was consolidated in Hollywood studios in the first decades of 20th century, dogs continued to appear in film, no longer as unplanned distractions, but as actors with headlining roles. Throughout the 1920s, in fact, one of the most famous actors in America was a German shepherd named Rin Tin Tin. He starred in 23 films that were so profitable they saved Warner Bros from bankruptcy more than once.</p> <p>Part of what made Rin Tin Tin successful is that he was working during the silent film era and critics were taken by his physical prowess. In a review for the Chicago Daily News, the poet Carl Sandberg wrote: \u201cHe has the power of expression in his every move that makes him one the leading pantomimists of the screen.\u201d</p> <p>As with other celebrities, the public was also fascinated with Rin Tin Tin\u2019s private life. During the first world war, he was rescued from a bombed-out trench by Lee Duncan, an American soldier who then dedicated his life to training the dog. In Los Angeles, Duncan would sometimes bring Rinty, as he was known, out on stage after the movie credits to demonstrate the range of his skills.</p> <p>While no other dog actor has since ascended Rinty\u2019s heights, they have continued to play major roles in cinema. It was Toto, after all, who unveiled the Wizard of Oz. And Doc Brown\u2019s pet sheepdog, Einstein, was the very first creature to be blasted forward in time in the DeLorean.</p> <p>But if the dog\u2019s presence onscreen delights, it also introduces an element of unpredictability in production. Dog training is a complex, time-consuming art. Not only does the dog actor have to learn bespoke behaviors for scenes, they have to bond with their fellow human actors and feel comfortable on set. And even then, the best-trained dog on the most professional set will occasionally give into some primal desire. Rin Tin Tin, for instance, once attacked a porcupine while shooting in the High Sierras, delaying production until the pock marks in his face healed.</p> <p>Since the 1940s, there have also been strict guidelines setting out appropriate behavior for animals on set, which is now codified in the American Humane Association\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.americanhumane.org/app/uploads/2016/08/Guidelines2015-WEB-Revised-110315-1.pdf\">127-page long</a> Guidelines for the Safe Use of Animals in Film Media. Animals rights groups like Peta closely monitor the industry to make sure producers comply, amplifying any hint of mistreatment to the public.

Sanders, who co-directed Lilo and Stitch and How to Train Your Dragon, designed Buck based off scanned images of a St Bernard collie cross that he and his wife adopted from a shelter in Kansas. The dog\u2019s on-screen movements were then performed by a renowned \u201ccreature actor\u201d named Terry Notary, who has been the invisible agent behind a number of CGI animals, including a murderous primate in Planet of the Apes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/17/the-call-of-the-wild-review-harrison-ford-jack-london-disney\">The Call of the Wild review \u2013 old-fashioned shaggy-dog story with bite</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the set of The Call of the Wild, Notary donned a mo-cap suit and acted out Buck\u2019s role, mimicking dog-like movements. The graphics team then replaced his form with a computer-generated version of the dog during the editing stage. The output is a beautifully rendered though somewhat disorienting figure on screen.</p> <p>In scenes where Buck is shot from a distance \u2013 chasing rabbits through fields or hauling a sled through over the Alaskan tundra \u2013 he looks like a convincing, if intensely oversized, dog. But then, in more intimate moments when Buck is interacting with Thornton, his expressions and behaviors are bizarrely anthropomorphized. For example, the dog somehow understands that Thornton has a drinking problem and gazes at him disapprovingly as he sips his evening whiskey.</p> <p>One of the joys of London\u2019s original novel is that it offers a dog\u2019s-eye view of the world, a story where the action was motivated by animal desire. No doubt, Buck\u2019s overdramatically humanlike expressions were an attempt to translate this into film. But for me it had the opposite effect. CGI Buck sits in an uncanny valley between dog-like human and human-like dog. He is visually compelling, but I felt no emotional draw to him as a character, as I have in the past with dogs on screen. (The Adventures of Milo and Otis is the very first movie I cried in.)</p> <p>Watching the film, I was reminded of Martin Scorsese\u2019s recent critique of the CGI-laden Marvel franchise. They are theme parks, he said, not movies. They provide \u201caudio visual entertainment\u201d with no friction, no mystery, no emotional resonance. This, he went on, signifies a larger trend in the movie industry, where films are optimized to distract, entertain and generate maximum revenue, leaving little room for movies that \u201cconfront the unexpected on the screen\u201d, which, for Scorsese, is the function of cinema.</p> <p>Since it first bounded on to the screen in the 19th century, the dog actor has been a medium for precisely this unexpected aesthetic experience. They perform unselfconsciously, with a heightened sense of immediacy. CGI Buck, a strange cyborg composite whose animal instincts are contrived by humans, fails to preserve this legacy. Indeed, he appears to represent precisely what Scorsese laments: the technological domestication of cinema.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 March 2020 because an earlier version incorrectly referred to \u201cDocTaylor\u2019s pet sheepdog, Einstein\u201d.

  "<p>It felt strange when Boris Johnson emerged from the first Covid-19 Cobra meeting on 2 March and told us to wash our hands while singing Happy Birthday.

However, the first recorded discovery of handwashing\u2019s life-saving power came 50 years earlier, in 1848, as a huge, unwelcome shock.</p> <p>\u201cIf there had to be a father of handwashing it would be Ignaz Semmelweis,\u201d says Miryam Wahrman, a professor of biology at William Paterson University in New Jersey and author of The Hand Book: Surviving in a Germ-Filled World. While working at Vienna General hospital, the Hungarian doctor was at the forefront of a more scientific approach to medicine. Faced with a doctor-led maternity ward in which maternal deaths from the dreaded childbed fever were significantly higher than in the midwife-run clinic there, he racked his brain for clues as to why.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5258315d7b7357a006cf9505243557ed0523f3d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5258315d7b7357a006cf9505243557ed0523f3d3/0_23_1998_1199/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joseph Lister and his assistants.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joseph Lister and his assistants.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Germs were yet to be discovered, and it was still believed in the 1840s that disease was spread by miasma \u2013 bad smells in the air \u2013 emanating from rotting corpses, sewage or vegetation. Victorians kept their windows firmly shut against such malevolent forces. So it didn\u2019t seem a problem that trainee doctors at Vienna General would hang out in the morgue dissecting corpses to figure out what had rendered them dead and then pop up to the maternity ward to deliver a baby without washing their hands.</p> <p>One of them then accidentally got cut by a scalpel during a dissection and died, seemingly of the same childbed fever the mothers had been getting. Semmelweis hypothesised that cadaverous particles from the morgue were to blame, and that such particles on the hands of doctors were making their way into women\u2019s bodies during childbirth.</p> <p>To test his theory, he ordered doctors to wash their hands and instruments in a chlorine solution, a substance he hoped would dispatch the deadly smell of cadaverous particles. Before the experiment, says Wahrman, \u201cthe mortality rate for new mothers was as high as 18%. After Semmelweis implemented hand hygiene between the morgue and the delivery room, the rate of mortality for new mothers dropped to about 1%.\u201d</p> <p>Despite his success, his idea faced great resistance, and met a tragic end. He lost his job, and is thought to have had a breakdown. He died in a psychiatric institution, \u201ca very despondent person at the untimely age of 47\u201d, says Wahrman.</p> <p>Part of the problem, says Tomes, was that people, \u201cdidn\u2019t have that conception of themselves as sort of walking petri dishes\u201d. And doctors were offended by the suggestion that they could be causing infections. \u201cThe majority of doctors in Vienna at this time were from middle- or upper-class families, and they thought of themselves as very clean people compared with the working-class poor. He was insulting them when he said their hands could be dirty.\u201d</p> <p>Over the next 40 years, an understanding of germs developed, and attitudes to hygiene gradually shifted. In 1857, while Semmelweis\u2019s mental health declined, Louis Pasteur, of pasteurisation fame, raised awareness of pathogens, and how to kill them with heat. In 1876, the German scientist Robert Koch discovered the anthrax bacillus, kicking off the new research field of medical bacteriology. Cholera, tuberculosis, diphtheria and typhoid bacilli were subsequently identified.</p> <p>Surgeons started handwashing in earnest. Tomes says: \u201cIf you\u2019re cutting open someone\u2019s skin \u2013 that protective layer \u2013 you need to take extraordinary precautions.\u201d The British surgeon Joseph Lister pioneered antiseptic surgery, which included handwashing, \u201cand by the 1890s and into the early 1900s,\u201d adds Tomes, \u201chandwashing moved from being something doctors did to something everybody had been told to do\u201d.</p> <p>Florence Nightingale helped. Despite still labouring under miasma theory, she intuitively improved hygiene in military hospitals during the Crimean war in the 1850s and, after returning to the UK, set about revolutionising nursing. \u201cNightingale influenced a new interest in household cleanliness as a goal that a good wife and mother needs to instil in her family,\u201d says Tomes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We thought this hygiene stuff was bourgeois nonsense. Being a\u00a0hippy involved embracing your microbial\u00a0self</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The turn of the century saw the first popular public health campaigns being launched around tuberculosis, says Tomes. \u201cKoch had shown that tuberculosis was not something you inherited from your grandmother, but that your grandmother coughed on you, and that\u2019s why you got it.\u201d The anti-tuberculosis movement was aimed at both adults and schoolchildren. \u201cYou really were getting little kids taught these rules about being clean and washing your hands.\u201d</p> <p>Tomes adds: \u201cPeople got totally phobic about shaking hands or kissing each other when they understood that their mouth, their skin and their hair had all these germs on them.\u201d It\u2019s one reason, she says, why young men started eschewing beards at the turn of the century. And why foods started being sold individually wrapped, because of \u201cthis fear of germs and hands touching things\u201d. But this hygiene-centric era was short-lived.</p> <p>The combination of public health messaging and the development of vaccines and antibiotics in the early 20th century saw death rates from bacterial diseases plummet. \u201cThe hyperattention to this kind of cleanliness became less important,\u201d says Tomes. \u201cA laxity crept in, I think, in healthcare and in everyday life after the second world war.\u201d</p> <p>Tomes herself is a product of the countercultural baby boomer generation, which rebelled against the rules imposed by their parents\u2019 and grandparents\u2019 generations. \u201cWe thought all this [hygiene] stuff was bourgeois nonsense,\u201d she says. \u201cBeing a hippy involved embracing the wonders of your microbial self.\u201d</p> <p>Sexually transmitted diseases started increasing again in the 1970s. \u201cPeople started to realise, well, these things can come back if we get careless,\u201d says Tomes. \u201cBut it was really with HIV coming in the 1980s \u2013 a novel, deadly, sneaky kind of virus \u2013 that everyone started to get hyper again about personal cleanliness.\u201d Even though, of course, HIV is transmitted by blood, semen, vaginal fluids and breast milk, so hand hygiene isn\u2019t a significant factor in prevention, Tomes says we have been operating with a more aware mindset in general since then. Hospital superbugs became a problem, \u201cand now we have these novel viruses coming pretty regularly, but we\u2019re also getting the re-emergence of bacterial diseases because of antibiotic resistance\u201d.</p> <p>Actual handwashing compliance, pre-coronavirus, was still worryingly low, however, in the public realm and in medical care. In her book, Wahrman cites research undertaken with university students in 2009, published in the American Journal of Infection Control. \u201cAfter urinating, 69% of women washed their hands, and only 43% of men,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter defecation, 84% of women and 78% of men washed their hands. And before eating \u2013 a critical time to wash your hands \u2013 10% of men and 7% of women washed their hands.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb869854a9f4f0ab2a935ff16d9633c9aee5bfb8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb869854a9f4f0ab2a935ff16d9633c9aee5bfb8/0_109_3192_1915/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018At the start of a pandemic, this is pretty much all you\u2019ve got.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018At the start of a pandemic, this is pretty much all you\u2019ve got.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EyeEm/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wahrman\u2019s mother died from a hospital-acquired infection, so writing the book, she says, \u201cwas personal\u201d. A study conducted in a teaching hospital at East Tennessee State University in 2007 found that staff handwashing between attending patients in all intensive care units (ICUs) had an overall compliance rate of just 54%. Staff in the paediatric ICU were much more conscientious, with 90% compliance, compared with just 35% in the adult ICU. After intervention and training, however, the compliance rate in the adult ICU was raised to 81%. We can only hope that the memes of the Covid-19 pandemic will see similar or even better rises among the public.</p> <p>How effective is handwashing? Petra Klepac, an assistant professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, looked into this question in 2018 while predicting how a flu pandemic would spread in the UK, for the documentary <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p059y0p1\" title=\"\">Contagion! The BBC Four Pandemic</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe were looking for systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and pooling the results from these studies,\u201d she says. <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436516300858\" title=\"\">One review</a>, published in 2017, found significant effects from handwashing, compared with nonsignificant effects from face-mask use. When Klepac and colleagues drilled down into the highest quality data, gathered from a clinical setting, with clinical diagnosis and a control group (who didn\u2019t increase hand hygiene) they discovered that if you washed your hands five to 10 times more than usual, \u201cthat would reduce your risk by a quarter\u201d.</p> <p>At the start of a pandemic, this is pretty much all you\u2019ve got. \u201cYou don\u2019t have pharmaceutical interventions,\u201d says Klepac. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a vaccine. This is why we\u2019re looking at nonpharmaceutical measures that are easily implemented.\u201d</p> <p>To Wahrman, this knowledge feels empowering. \u201cYou can say to people: \u2018Here\u2019s one thing you can do to lower your risk.\u2019 It\u2019s simple. It\u2019s right there and doesn\u2019t cost anything. Wash your hands with soap before you touch your mouth, your nose or your eyes.

Dozens more are scheduled for transplants in the next 30 days.</p> <p>In many cases, the patients have already begun a grueling treatment of high-dose chemotherapy and radiation to prepare for their transplants, and will need stem cells from donors to arrive on time.</p> <p>The process of delivering the stem cells has been severely complicated by global travel bans, border closings and quarantine rules that force couriers into isolation for 14 days after they have returned from a high-risk area.</p> <p>DKMS scored a major victory last weekend when its US partner, the National Marrow Donor Program, helped secure a travel waiver from the Centers for Disease Control that will allow couriers who are non-US citizens and non-residents to travel to the US to deliver stem cells collected from European donors.</p> <p>But the group is still beset by other logistical issues and concerns, including questions about whether future planned donations will be hampered by flight cancellations and staffing issues in hospitals overwhelmed by Covid-19 patients.</p> <p>Closed borders within Europe are also creating havoc, with DKMS pointing to one difficult recent case in which stem cells were collected from a donor in Poland, brought to Frankfurt, Germany, and then sent to the US. Travel bans in India and Israel are also a big problem.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the problems we have right now is that there are less and less couriers and normal passenger flights will be reduced in the days and weeks,\u201d said Elke Neujahr, the global chief executive of DKMS, who said the group is trying to recruit new couriers. \u201cWe think we will run out of regular commercial flights soon.\u201d</p> <p>One possible solution \u2013 which Neujahr said will probably be necessary beginning two weeks from now \u2013 will be for cargo plane pilots to personally carry the stem cells on their flights so that they can be delivered to medical professionals at airports, and then brought to hospitals.</p> <p>Asked if she believed cargo pilots will be willing to help, since stem cells must be carried in-person, Neujahr said: \u201cI think they will do it, because if they know they can save a life, their willingness will be very, very high.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-map-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">Coronavirus map of the US: latest cases state by state</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The problems facing DKMS and similar organizations show how the pandemic is affecting every aspect of medical care, including for the most vulnerable cancer patients.</p> <p>While many hospitals are delaying non-emergency treatments and surgeries in the face of the pandemic, the aggressive nature of many blood cancers means that transplants cannot be delayed.</p> <p>Marcel van den Brink, head of the hematological malignancies division at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York and international chairman of DKMS, described several big challenges he faced last weekend, from tracking the movements of staff who have come into contact with patients who are positive for Covid-19, to planning for a possible drastic reduction in available doctors and other staff due to illness, which could require pulling doctors from other services to help treat Covid-19 patients.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no doubt that cancer care is going to be compromised and Sophie\u2019s Choice-like choices will have to be made.

  "<p>The past week has seen drastic changes all over the world, in particular, Italy. This began last week with a lockdown in northern Italy, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/04/italy-orders-closure-of-schools-and-universities-due-to-coronavirus\">closure of schools and universities</a> across the country, and now a complete lockdown across the whole nation. My life as a primary school teacher here in Tuscany has changed radically. I have been working at a private international school for two years, and what once involved me walking to school, interacting with colleagues and teaching in the classroom has now become an online, virtual experience. There have been many conversations online about whether coronavirus will usher in a new age of home working and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/online-learning\">e-learning</a>. And while at first the kids have loved it, problems are cropping up, not least because the model favours the children of families with access to technology, space and time.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some of my colleagues have expressed concerns about their pupils\u2019 wellbeing, saying they\u2019re struggling to keep up morale</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My school has looked to pioneers in e-learning in Asia, where teachers have already found their way through school closures and quarantines. We use a mixture of software to communicate between staff and with the students, including Google Hangouts, Zoom, FaceTime, Microsoft Teams and an e-learning app called Seesaw.</p> <p>By day, my 40 sq ft apartment becomes a classroom. Where I used to relax and watch TV is now my very own recording studio where I film myself explaining tasks and demonstrating activities. Where I used to prepare meals together with my housemate and reflect on the day has become an area to produce props for these lessons. I found myself, the other day, sticking together two toilet rolls to make a model of a cow\u2019s femur, on which I etched little drawings of jars and loaves of bread to show the children how people in Mesopotamia used to mark animal bones as a rudimentary form of payment.</p> <p>My private life and work life are no longer separate \u2013 something that\u2019s been made all the more noticeable by the closing of shops, cafes and all but a few supermarkets, which are now one-in, one-out, with staff wearing full protective clothing. We\u2019re questioned by police if we go outside. Thankfully I live with a colleague, so we have each other to keep company. I know a lot of our friends who live alone are finding it really isolating. It\u2019s quite an anxious time and will be taking a toll on people\u2019s mental health.</p> <p>I try to set all my activities the day before. Through Seesaw, we can schedule them to sync with what\u2019s on the children\u2019s timetable. As I want children to be responsible for their own learning, I try to set activities that are engaging and independent. Then, using FaceTime, I call eight of the children in my class, and work through a problem with them, before calling another eight. It\u2019s been interesting to see the role the children\u2019s families play \u2013 engaging the children, helping them out and congratulating them when they\u2019ve done well. I heard one child\u2019s parent cheer the other day as she had never heard him speak English before.</p> <p>However, the model is heavily skewed to those with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/18/almost-50-of-the-world-is-online-what-about-the-other-50\">access to resources</a>. I\u2019m very aware that I\u2019m working at a private school, where all our children have iPads. My friends at local state schools say they have been printing out stacks of papers containing all of the children\u2019s exercises for the week, which their parents then collect for them on Monday mornings. They\u2019re left to their own devices as to whether they complete these exercises or not.</p> <p>The role of parents has been crucial to this e-learning experiment working, and again we teachers are very fortunate in this regard. Now the whole country is in lockdown, children have their parents around to help them with their schoolwork. I wonder whether, if a child\u2019s parent or parents have to go out to work, that child will be at a disadvantage in terms of their learning? We have also noticed that, despite their best efforts, children are doing less work overall. Their parents are not teachers so cannot help them in the ways we are trained to do. And of course it is a major burden on the parents to have to take on this role in the background while they are trying to live their own lives and get on with their jobs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/italy-europe-covid-economy-ecb-coronavirus\">Italy will be Europe's canary in the coalmine for the post-Covid economy | Marchel Alexandrovich</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My main concern though is for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/feb/03/english-schools-buying-in-mental-health-support-has-almost-doubled-in-three-years\">children\u2019s wellbeing</a>, rather than their education. Children have boundless energy that needs space to flow. They\u2019re cooped up indoors all day, and don\u2019t get the chance to socialise. Our PE teachers are even running their classes by getting the pupils to send videos of themselves completing certain actions such as throwing a ball. Kids who have gardens are served a lot better. Some of my colleagues have expressed concerns about their pupils\u2019 wellbeing, saying they\u2019re slumped in front of their iPads, struggling a little to keep up morale. I try to get all of my kids to end each lesson with a silly face or a funny noise in a bid to keep the mood a lighter.</p> <p>I really hope that come 3 April, when the government has said all of this will end, it does end. This time has provided a strange glimpse into the possible future of learning \u2013 and it\u2019s one that has both its ups and downs. While it is an exciting step forward in upskilling students in digital literacy, does it come at the cost of deskilling their social, emotional and psychological selves? It also does not make for a system that provides equal outcomes.

  "<p>The dissident father of the Manchester Arena bomber, who was arrested in Libya the day after the blast alongside his other terrorist son, was quietly released without charge and has vanished.</p> <p>Ramadan Abedi, 54, fought against the Gaddafi regime in Libya with a militant group that was designated a terrorist organisation by the US. After his arrest, he and his son Hashem were held by the Rada Special Deterrence Force, the most powerful of Tripoli\u2019s militias, at its base at Mitiga airport with dozens of other terrorist suspects and fighters.</p> <p>As the jail was repeatedly attacked by rival militias trying to free members held there, the British focused on bringing Hashem Abedi, 22, back to the UK to face charges in relation to the bombing. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/17/hashem-abedi-brother-of-manchester-arena-bomber-being-extradited-to-uk\">was eventually extradited last year</a>, but Ramadan was released without charge and disappeared.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know [where he is], nobody is speaking about it,\u201d said Abdel al-Fattah, the director of the foreign media office of Libya\u2019s UN-backed government. \u201cEven the local media don\u2019t speak about him.\u201d</p> <p>There is no mention of him on Libyan social media and a British diplomatic source said the UK had no contact with the dual Libyan-British national.</p> <p>When the Guardian contacted Kerea Tabbal, Ramadan\u2019s mother-in-law and the brothers\u2019 maternal grandmother at her home in Libya, she refused to confirm any details about his location. She responded angrily to being called, saying: \u201cI am an old woman, don\u2019t you have any shame?\u201d</p> <p>Former editor of the English-language Libya Herald newspaper Michel Cousins said Ramadan Abedi had no public profile in Libya prior to the Manchester bombing and his vanishing from sight after release excited no curiosity: \u201cHe\u2019s not important as far as Libyans are concerned, they don\u2019t want to know about it (the trial), its embarrassing. There are only two issues in Libya, the conflict east against west, and coronavirus.\u201d</p> <p>Hashem Abedi was transferred to Britain in July 2019 after both militia and government agreed to the UK request, but there was no news of Ramadan, with a British source saying only that he was no longer being held in jail.</p> <p>The veteran of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), an Islamist guerrilla organisation that battled Gaddafi\u2019s forces in the 1990s, first arrived in Britain in 1994. When the LIFG was defeated, many veterans fled to Afghanistan and Iraq, several becoming prominent members of al-Qaida.</p> <p>Initially Ramadan went to Saudi Arabia, but it is understood the Saudis persuaded Britain to take him in during a period when the two countries were negotiating the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/07/bae15\">Al-Yamamah arms deal</a>.</p> <p>In Manchester, Ramadan, a security officer, was popular among some Libyan exiles, being assigned the role of muezzin at Didsbury mosque and calling out prayer five times a day.</p> <p>He and his wife, Samia, lived in south Manchester for more than a decade. All of their children were enrolled in schools and the family were said to be settled.</p> <p>However, some Manchester Libyans began to object to his radical style. \u201cWe call them the Abus, because they all adopt these kunyas, these nicknames, its like \u2018comrade\u2019, an alias,\u201d said one British-Libyan resident. \u201cThere is tension, a lot of Libyans in Manchester, they don\u2019t want to be associated with them.\u201d</p> <p>In 2011, Ramadan decided to travel back to his north African homeland to fight in the civil war, also referred to as the Libyan revolution, once again with the LIFG. The US state department says elements of the LIFG were aligned with Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida and it designated the group a foreign terrorist organisation in 2004. The armed conflict between forces loyal to Gaddafi and those seeking to oust his government lasted for eight months, but Ramadan was never to make the UK his home again.</p> <p>Fellow LIFG fighter Akram Ramadan, 49, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/may/24/bombers-father-fought-against-gaddafi-regime-with-terrorist-group\">previously told the Guardian</a> that Ramadan was passionate about overthrowing a regime that had \u201cdisplaced thousands of his brethren \u2026 It was something we all felt we had to do. Some were more radical than others but we all shared a common cause.</p> <p>\u201cI saw Ramadan in the mountains and later in Tripoli. We were all soldiers \u2013 we all bore arms. It was a war zone. Many of the people who fought in the conflict weren\u2019t actually born in Libya, but they had this common cause of their families being persecuted or being kicked out of the country by the regime.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I met Ramadan it was always at the forefront of his mind about how we were going to gain control of our country again. He was very passionate about the common cause and common good for Libya.\u201d</p> <p>He said the LIFG fought again Gaddafi in the mid-90s in the eastern side of Libya and was defeated in 1996. \u201cIt was a group that wanted to overthrow Gaddafi but they also possibly had some guys who were affiliated with al-Qaida. Did some of these guys carry the torch of al-Qaida? Possibly.\u201d</p> <p>In 2013, Ramadan resurfaced online and wrote a supportive post of another Libyan radical, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/oct/11/afghanistan.september111\">Anas Al-Libi</a>, who was given asylum in Manchester despite his involvement in a failed plot to assassinate Egypt\u2019s then-president Hosni Mubarak. Libi was later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/07/son-al-qaida-suspect-libya\">captured in Tripoli</a> by US special forces and charged with bombing US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.</p> <p>British support for Libyan dissidents changed abruptly after Tony Blair\u2019s rapprochement with Gaddafi, sealed with the famous \u201cmeeting in the desert\u201d in 2004.</p> <p>Under Blair\u2019s pro-Gaddafi policy, MI6 agents arranged the kidnapping of the LIFG leader, Abdul Hakim Bilhaj, and his deputy, Sami Saadi, from exile in Asia. Both were flown to Libya to be jailed and tortured, and they later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/10/britain-apologises-for-appalling-treatment-of-abdel-hakim-belhaj\">successfully sued</a> the British government.</p> <p>During the 2011 Arab spring, British policy switched yet again, back to supporting Libyan dissidents, encouraging exiles, such as Ramadan, to return to Libya to fight Gaddafi, and contributing RAF warplanes to a Nato-led bombing campaign. Ramadan joined the revolution and afterwards settled in Tripoli.</p> <p>In 2012, he posted a picture on social media of Hashem, then 15, holding a Kalashnikov with the caption: \u201cHashem the lion \u2026 training.\u201d</p> <p>In an interview in 2017, shortly before he and Hashem were seized by Tripoli militia, Ramadan proclaimed his innocence, saying: \u201cWe condemn these terrorist acts on civilians. We do not believe in killing innocent people.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Goths are perhaps the most maligned of all subcultures. Over the decades, they have been <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-apr-22-mn-29941-story.html\" title=\"\">unfairly blamed</a> for high-school shootings, <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(15)00164-9/fulltext\" title=\"\">depression in teenagers</a> and antisocial behaviour. In reality, goths are a collective of people bound by a shared love of fashion, music and art.</p> <p>Goth emerged out of the punk scene in the north of England in the 1980s. Its adherents are immediately recognisable by their black clothing and jewellery, their passion for artists such as Siouxsie and the Banshees, Bauhaus, Nick Cave and the Sisters of Mercy, and their fondness for imagery and lyrics referencing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2019/mar/19/why-goths-will-always-defend-their-right-to-shock\">macabre, darkness and death</a>. And the eyeliner, of course.</p> <p>Years of unfavourable press attention have bound goths together more tightly than other subcultures. \u201cThe scene has been partly defined by how it\u2019s been viewed negatively,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/paul-hodkinson\" title=\"\">Dr Paul Hodkinson</a>, a sociologist at the University of Surrey and an expert in goth culture. \u201cThat negative attention can give its participants an extra commitment to the scene, and strengthens their identity in the face of a perceived mainstream society that misunderstands or mistreats them.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Unlike other subcultures, says Hodkinson, goth culture tends to be close-knit as a result of this shared experience of victimisation. Many goths stay active in the scene throughout their lives. We spoke to some of Britain\u2019s long-standing goths about the scene, fashion and music, and whether they ever see themselves wearing colour in their future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"737a31778f92c3c5bae17d9dd0220426e19f50e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/737a31778f92c3c5bae17d9dd0220426e19f50e9/116_0_2905_3632/800.jpg\" alt=\"Lee Edward Armstrong.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee Edward Armstrong.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Pope/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Lee Edward Armstrong </strong><br><strong>45, runs a manufacturing company in Peterborough</strong></h2> <p>I have been a goth since university. There was a girl \u2013 she was interesting and cool and she dragged me to a goth club. Nothing ever happened with her, but the goth thing stuck.</p> <p>I was living in Wolverhampton at the time, and there wasn\u2019t much goth stuff going on. I heard about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2017/oct/30/whitby-goth-weekend-in-pictures\">the first</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2017/oct/30/whitby-goth-weekend-in-pictures\"> Whitby Goth festival</a>, in 1994, through forums on the internet. There were 212 of us there. It completely exploded my mind.</p> <p>My dress sense has varied a lot over the years. I\u2019m not as young as I once was. I don\u2019t have a full mohican any more \u2013 I got rid of it around 2000, when I started going thin on top. Since then, I\u2019ve developed a love of hats. I\u2019ve got a massive wardrobe. I wouldn\u2019t call it a wardrobe \u2013 it\u2019s probably about three rooms.</p> <p>I always make a big effort on Halloween. One year, I was a white wolf. I had lace-up white boots, a white gothic jacket and a wolf head. I crept up behind my friend and growled at her. She ended up having a panic attack. I guess that outfit was a little too successful.</p> <p>Being goth is not something I\u2019m going to grow out of. I\u2019ve got masses of friends from the alternative scene. There\u2019s this misconception that all goths are miserable. Yes, there\u2019s a sense of macabre, but there\u2019s an amazing camaraderie and sense of community.</p> <p>I think because of my size, I get less abuse than other goths. I\u2019m quite good at de-escalating hostile situations. I can normally sort things out without fighting. There\u2019s always the odd drive-by shouting, but you get used to that. A few years ago, I was in Camden, north London, with a girlfriend \u2014 we were all dressed up to go to a ball. People in the street started whistling The Addams Family theme tune. But we were quite proud of it. At one of the earliest Whitbys, a few idiots came up from Scarborough and decided they would try and intimidate us by blaring 80s music from a Vauxhall Corsa. But the police moved them on pretty fast.</p> <p>Lots of goths tend to avoid customer-facing roles, because they get asked to tone down their outfits by their bosses. I\u2019ve only been asked to do that once, when I was working for a traffic company years ago. I had grabbed a T-shirt out of a drawer without looking at it and it had quite an offensive slogan on it, so that was fair enough. It\u2019s not such an issue for me, because I quite like wearing suits. I look good in them \u2013 as long as they are tailored.</p> <p>I have a theory that lots of goths were bullied growing up. Society turned its back on us, so we all went off and did our own thing. The clothes and the makeup are just a way to differentiate who is worth getting to know. Some people look at the clothes and are put off. But the people who take the time to look beneath it are the ones worth getting to know.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1ff73c9fa0c08210b047ed96efd8ae4337636053\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ff73c9fa0c08210b047ed96efd8ae4337636053/0_232_3840_4800/800.jpg\" alt=\"Cinzia Bacilieri.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cinzia Bacilieri.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Cinzia Bacilieri </strong><br><strong>Lecturer </strong><strong>at the University of York</strong></h2> <p>I have been a goth since I was 13. It\u2019s just my taste \u2013 I\u2019m drawn to darkness. Growing up in Italy, I was really into music and art. I loved Caravaggio, because he was so dark. I discovered the band Paradise Lost when I was 18 \u2013 they were the first band I heard that blended metal with goth. For me, that was the perfect mix. I read an interview with them where they talked about being from Yorkshire, and I thought: where is Yorkshire? When I moved to York, it was bizarre, knowing I was in the place where goth metal was basically invented.</p> <p>I dress goth every day. I haven\u2019t worn colour since I was 14. Normally, I wear pale foundation, black eyeliner and blue, black or dark red lipstick. I can\u2019t see myself ever wearing colour. I briefly worked as a theatre steward in Cambridge when I was younger. The uniform was yellow \u2013 it wasn\u2019t like it was burning my skin or anything, but now that I don\u2019t have to wear a uniform, I only ever wear black. I think if I ever went into work wearing coloured clothes, my colleagues would have a heart attack! We joke that I should wear a floral dress on Halloween.</p> <p>My house is entirely black and white. I have too many skulls to count. I\u2019m really proud of the downstairs toilet \u2013 I call it my little catacomb. It\u2019s painted black, even the ceiling, and I have a customised loo-roll holder in the shape of a coffin. I\u2019m currently waiting for a customised four-poster bed with a built-in spiderweb to arrive.</p> <p>I\u2019m more into goth music than the aesthetic. I don\u2019t like how the goth scene is split in two. There are the people who are there because they love the music, and then the people who just like to go to Whitby and dress up. Why would you pretend to be goth just for a day? It makes a mockery of goth culture.</p> <p>People assume that you\u2019re depressed if you\u2019re a goth, but it\u2019s just the way I am. I think it\u2019s a positive thing to think about death. You think about the end to remind yourself to make the most of life each day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4bd2c51d81e0dfbe6b6b3e2bf3fee9e8973d9dc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bd2c51d81e0dfbe6b6b3e2bf3fee9e8973d9dc4/0_0_2654_4000/664.jpg\" alt=\"Joel Heyes.\" width=\"664\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joel Heyes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Quarmby</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Joel Heyes </strong><br><strong>42, civil servant from Leeds</strong></h2> <p>I have been a goth, on and off, for 20 years. I got into it as a teenager \u2013 I would listen to bands such as Sisters of Mercy, the Mission and New Model Army. It helped that I grew up in West Yorkshire, which is where lots of goth culture was based. Growing up in a small town, people weren\u2019t used to alternative subcultures; they were quite vocal about it. You had to be careful about how you would present yourself in public, to avoid getting into trouble.</p> <p>I can still remember my first proper goth night out. It was a club called the Phono, this old-school alternative goth club in Leeds. I\u2019d go there all the time. It was so exciting. It was this world of dreadlocks, big hair, PVC and Dr Martens.</p> <p>For a long time, the goth scene was in decline, but things are probably as good now as they have ever been. I run a festival called Goth City and in addition to that there are maybe a dozen goth festivals in the UK, and 100 gigging goth bands.</p> <p>If I\u2019ve got meetings at work, I wear a suit. Otherwise, I wear black jeans, a black blazer, pointed boots and a black frock coat. I always find myself returning to that hammy Victorian style \u2013 I like the tailcoat and white shirt and big hair aesthetic. David Vanian of the Damned is probably my biggest style influence. And if I\u2019m going out, I like to make my long black hair as big as possible with hairspray.</p> <p>I would like to be able to express myself as I want more often. Work isn\u2019t such an issue \u2013 you can rock a strong goth look and still be extremely smart. I think goths tend to look more professional than non-goths. But it\u2019s harder to find the time and spaces to dress goth as you get older. It becomes less practical, as you are in goth spaces less often. That said, I definitely don\u2019t ever go out in tracksuits or blue jeans. I do own a single pair of jeans. I wear them maybe once a year, in summer.</p> <p>There can be a bit of street heckling that goes on. It\u2019s never particularly intelligent: people will shout \u201cDracula\u201d, or whatever horror movie they can think of. It\u2019s only ever if I find myself in a town centre on a Friday or Saturday night, when people have been drinking. That\u2019s when you want to be careful. But I would never go out in that environment anyway, because you\u2019re looking for conflict. I tend to avoid town centres on a weekend. I don\u2019t want to attract attention. It\u2019s not really an issue for me \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t want to go out there anyway. Nothing brings me into town.</p> <p>I see myself as an old-school goth. Not in an elitist way, but more in the sense of being true to the original counter-culture tradition of goth, as it came out of Leeds. We have an agenda that is liberal and progressive and an affinity to a darker, romantic view of the world. We\u2019re not all unhappy. There are a lot of extremely chipper goths out there. The idea that all goths are morbid and depressed definitely isn\u2019t the case.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bbf89a02ab286cd2d88276e010713cc313b92935\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbf89a02ab286cd2d88276e010713cc313b92935/0_480_3840_4800/800.jpg\" alt=\"Mel Butler.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mel Butler.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Mel Butler </strong><br><strong>47, a sales assistant from Teesside</strong></h2> <p>I got into goth music when I was 13. When you\u2019re a teenager, you feel like you need your own identity. Post-punk alternative goth music appealed to me, so I went from there. My father absolutely hated it. He couldn\u2019t understand why I was dressed all in black. The more he disliked it, the more I rebelled.</p> <p>Between 13 and 16, I couldn\u2019t go to pubs or nightclubs and meet other goths, so I stayed in my bedroom and listened to goth music and read Melody Maker and NME. When I left my bedroom, I would wear black leggings, pointy boots, a Sisters of Mercy T-shirt and have my hair all black and crimped. I did get a lot of stick for how I looked \u2013 I was the only goth in my sleepy market town.</p> <p>As soon as I turned 18, I moved to Leeds because that was the epicentre of goth culture. It was great: amazing nightlife, really nice people. But the scene died overnight in 93, 94. I\u2019d go down to the Phono nightclub and it had completely changed. All the people I knew there had stopped going. They all moved on with their lives. But I thought: \u201cI\u2019m not ready to grow out of this.\u201d So it developed into more of a lifestyle than a phase. There isn\u2019t another Mel who isn\u2019t a goth.</p> <p>My house is all goth: black flock wallpaper, black settees, black gloss furniture, baroque-style ornaments. I never get bored of wearing black. It\u2019s a godsend, because you never have to separate your clothes when you\u2019re wearing them. I married a goth. We had the wedding in a castle, and I wore a purple corset, with a big flouncy skirt to go with it, and purple and black hair extensions.</p> <p>Any time something bad happens, like a shooting spree, people say: \u201cHe was dressed in a trench coat and listening to Marilyn Manson.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t define goth. It goes a lot deeper.</p>",
  "<p>A decision about whether Missouri\u2019s last abortion clinic can remain open is \u201cimminent\u201d, advocates involved in the case have said.</p> <p>Last summer Republican state officials refused to relicense the state\u2019s last clinic, a Planned Parenthood in St Louis. If it shuts, Missouri will be the first state in the US to have no abortion clinic since abortion was legalized in 1973 in the Roe v Wade supreme court decision.</p> <p>Advocates have argued that the state\u2019s decision not to relicense the clinic is a political move to end abortion in a state long hostile to reproductive rights. The same year the clinic\u2019s license was denied, the state passed a restrictive eight-week abortion ban.</p> <p>Efforts to close the clinic in Missouri come in the context of a nationwide effort to restrict abortion. Last year, state lawmakers across the south and midwest passed \u201cheartbeat bills\u201d, which restrict abortion at six weeks.</p> <p>A judge\u2019s ruling on the Missouri case is expected soon as Monday was the last day for attorneys representing the state and Planned Parenthood to file legal briefs.</p> <p>Already, state statistics have shown women are leaving Missouri to obtain abortions. \u201cAbortion access is so difficult in Missouri that the majority of people choose to cross state lines instead of accessing care in their home state,\u201d said Yamelsie Rodr\u00edguez, CEO of the St Louis Planned Parenthood clinic.</p> <p>Only three women obtained abortions at the St Louis clinic in February, according to state data records <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/12/814768754/as-missouri-clinic-awaits-its-legal-fate-abortions-in-state-have-virtually-halte\">analyzed by NPR</a>. That is down from 174 the year before. More than 300 Missouri women crossed state lines into Illinois to obtain abortions. Rodr\u00edguez cited 72-hour waiting periods for an abortion, state-mandated counseling and, at one point, medically unnecessary pelvic exams as driving women to other states.</p> <p>In addition, court hearings revealed state officials had tracked women\u2019s menstrual cycles in an effort to find incomplete abortions at the clinic, and that the abortion clinic is the state\u2019s only outpatient facility inspected annually and that inspectors did not find an unsafe environment. State officials have claimed they revoked the license for alleged safety violations.</p> <p>Even more extreme measures have been introduced, though not passed, in other statehouses across the US. A group of Ohio lawmakers introduced a bill to make \u201cabortion murder\u201d a crime and requiring doctor to try to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/29/ohio-extreme-abortion-bill-reimplant-ectopic-pregnancy\">\u201creimplant\u201d ectopic pregnancies</a>, an impossible feat. One Missouri lawmaker introduced a bill to try to give due process rights to fetuses, and to then have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/06/missouri-abortion-police-bill-mike-moon\">local law enforcement</a> to stop women from having abortions.</p> <p>The case also comes in the context of the most high-profile reproductive rights case to come before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/04/us-supreme-court-abortion-case-louisiana-arguments\">supreme court</a> in decades. The court heard oral arguments this month on whether Louisiana could legally restrict abortion access. If upheld, the case could have severe nationwide implications.</p> <p>\u201cNo one should be forced out of their home state just to access healthcare,\u201d said Planned Parenthood\u2019s CEO, Alexis McGill Johnson, about statistics showing more women were seeking abortions in Illinois. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in Missouri could soon be the reality for many more states and millions of other people. It is no coincidence that just over a week ago, we were rallying in front of the supreme court \u2013 the right to control your body, life, and future is on the line.\u201d</p>",
  "<h2>Top story: Queen and Philip batten down in Windsor</h2> \n<p>Hello \u2013 Warren Murray, keeping you close to the news in this time of social distancing.</p> \n<p>Travellers across the world are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-travellers-race-home-amid-worldwide-border-closures-and-flight-warnings\">scrambling to find flights home</a> as the number of coronavirus cases nears 200,000 globally, prompting governments to urge citizens to return and some nations to announce the imminent closure of airports and borders. The Australian government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/17/coalitions-second-multibillion-dollar-coronavirus-stimulus-expected-to-target-businesses-and-low-income-earners\">has advised citizens to return home</a> as soon as possible by commercial means, warning that overseas travel is becoming \u201cmore complex and difficult\u201d. Canada, New Zealand, Indonesia and the UAE have issued similar blanket advice. In the UK, the foreign office is warning against all but essential travel to many countries. It is withdrawing some staff from its embassy in Myanmar and has told British citizens to leave the country if able to do so due to \u201cpotential pressures on medical facilities\u201d and the risk of flights shutting down.

Every business in the retail, leisure and hospitality sector will have a year-long holiday from business rates with smaller companies eligible for a cash grant of up to \u00a325,000. The chancellor also announced cash grants of \u00a310,000 for the UK\u2019s 700,000 smallest companies and a three-month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/mar/17/uk-banks-set-out-details-of-covid-19-mortgage-holidays\">moratorium on mortgage payments</a> for home owners having difficulty because of the virus. Sunak said measures would be announced in coming days to help those renting. The Guardian\u2019s financial editor, Nils Pratley, writes that in terms of the scale of the intervention \u201cthe UK has never seen anything like it\u201d but to avert mass layoffs the government may need to go further and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/17/chancellors-330bn-coronavirus-package-is-big-but-not-big-enough\">underwrite British companies\u2019 payroll costs</a> as some other countries are doing. Keir Starmer, one of the Labour leadership finalists, writes that as well as those renting, areas like the social care sector need more money, as do local authorities and public services, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/the-chancellors-stimulus-package-doesnt-go-nearly-far-enough\">but they received none</a>: \u201cThe extra fiscal stimulus announced by the chancellor is overdue, but we have to be honest that it is does not go far enough.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Queen is to decamp early to Windsor Castle before Easter, while cancelling her traditional garden parties and postponing investitures.

In terms of everyday practicalities for the rest of us: Sainsbury\u2019s is closing its cafes and meat, fish and pizza service counters so staff can work on providing the essentials. It says supplies are still flowing in but shoppers will be restricted to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/17/four-items-per-shopper-restrictions-at-uk-supermarkets-as-demand-soars\">maximum of three items of any grocery product</a> and two packets of popular items such as toilet paper, soap and UHT milk.

  "<p>An old Russian friend teases me when I complain about British politics. He finds my tales of Westminster negligence and dysfunction touchingly insipid. When I described pro-European trauma on the morning after the Brexit referendum, he shot back: \u201cAt least you all went to bed not knowing what the result was going to be.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/government-response-to-coronavirus-led-by-science-grant-shapps\">UK government response to coronavirus 'led by science' \u2013 Grant Shapps</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The morning after Russia\u2019s most recent presidential election in 2018, no one woke up surprised that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/19/vladimir-putin-secures-record-win-in-russian-presidential-election\">Vladimir Putin had won</a>. The result did raise a question of how the incumbent would get around constitutional term limits that should exclude his candidacy in 2024. The solution was revealed last week in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/power-bid-could-leave-vladimir-putin-in-charge-till-2036\">proposal to rewrite the rules</a>. The clock will be reset so Putin can run again and again. The arrangements will be ratified in a referendum, on the eve of which no Russian will go to bed unsure about the result.</p> <p>To oppose Putin in a polling booth is futile, and less secluded action is potentially dangerous. There is a great Russian tradition of defying authoritarian rule, but it proceeds by the slow-burn propulsion of endurance and martyrdom. If the regime has brittleness I am not qualified to measure it. That was hard enough when I lived in Moscow and I know better than to tackle Kremlin enigmas with an out-of-date code book.</p> <p>My Russian is a bit rusty, too. But I have not forgotten the feeling of a society submerged in mistrust of politics. Communist rule laid deep foundations of cynicism. The Party failed to provide people with the goods and rights they craved, so instead penalised the craving itself as decadent and seditious. Post-Soviet transition swapped the caprice of ideological bullies for lawless gangsterism. The idea of democracy was discredited by the chaos. Justice felt no less arbitrary than before, with the added indignity of losing the USSR\u2019s superpower status.</p> <p>Putin exploited that trauma, casting himself as the guarantor of stability and macho incarnation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/12/macho-election-russia-usa-putin-trump-negotiations\">national self-confidence</a>. On that ticket he could still have been competitive in elections without all the intimidation and state propaganda but he didn\u2019t take any chances.</p> <p>That political evolution has bred contempt for the idea of public service through elected office. It promotes a jaundiced view of motive, seeing the darkest intent behind any official deed, presuming that the truest analysis is the one that unearths the most malicious plan via the most convoluted conspiracy. And because democracy did not flourish in Russia it must be ridiculed abroad. To suggest that western politicians ever try to do the right thing, or that bad outcomes can be accidental, invites derision.</p> <p>The taste of that embitterment is not easily forgotten. I recognised it as it seeped into Britain \u2013 a familiar credulous cynicism that will believe fairytales if they are shared in a paranoid whisper, branded as secrets that shadowy powers do not want you to know. The BBC covers up the truth; Brussels funds the opposition; Zionists pull the strings. This stuff is acrid and endemic online, stirred up by international troll battalions and extremist provocateurs. It corrodes the base of common facts, churning up the level ground on which liberal, pluralist institutions can build consent for government.</p> <p>That mechanism has been weaponised by the Kremlin. It works by persuading citizens in functioning democracies that their own governments are no better than authoritarian ones, and just as worthy of contempt. It is depressing to see it working, when British citizens <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/27/trust-becoming-principal-casualty-of-britains-raging-political-war\">denigrate their institutions</a> the way Russians dismiss theirs, complaining as if our own elections are hardly less fraudulent than the ones that keep Putin in office.</p> <p>It is hardest to praise democracy when its output is unwelcome. Noisy pro-European campaigners hated the referendum result so much they rejected claims that political trust would be undermined by aborting Brexit, although many quieter former remain voters felt the job had to be seen through. Fans of Jeremy Corbyn want to believe that the rightwing media hypnotised the working class out of affection for socialism, although the Labour leader needed no help repelling voters. There is much to repair in Britain\u2019s electoral machinery, from the voting system to the poor invigilation of campaign finance. Its hinges creak with anachronism, but it is not a sham.</p> <p>To affirm that faith invites charges of naivety or complacency. History counsels vigilance and the imagination can always plot a curve from ministerial misadventure towards dictatorship. Any slope away from ideal practice can be made to look slippery.<strong> </strong>The coming months dealing with Covid-19 will test our liberal political culture in unfamiliar ways. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/self-isolating-tory-mp-criticises-parliament-response-to-covid-19-coronavirus\">Parliament will struggle</a> to function; emergency powers will resemble the draconian expedients of war. It is the closest most of us will come to living under martial law. The pausing of freedoms we have long taken for granted can be tolerable only if we believe they can survive hibernation.</p> <p>The government response has not always radiated competence.<strong> </strong>We do not know how the economy or our institutions will cope. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/school-pupils-could-be-sent-elsewhere-under-uk-coronavirus-plans\">Emergency laws</a> expose tensions between liberty and security and it is essential to guard against casual disposal of fundamental rights. It is also important to resist the excesses of anti-political mania common to fire-breathing radicals on the left and right alike, who point at democracy\u2019s imperfections and call them tyranny.</p> <p>Boris Johnson is deeply flawed, dishonest and cavalier, but not a thief or a murderer. His unserious style doesn\u2019t suit the gravity of the moment, but he is a creature of British political tradition and not a despot. Those who hate seeing him in Downing Street can be consoled by the knowledge that he is not our prime minister for life. Despair at election results is tempered by the belief that other outcomes were genuinely possible. There is democratic privilege hidden in political disappointment, so long as it comes with an element of surprise.</p> <p>In authoritarian regimes there is no consensual management of freedoms. They are bestowed or withdrawn from on high. Putin adorns his power with the symbols of democracy \u2013 elections and court rulings \u2013 but he does it out of contempt for the real thing. The Kremlin-issued facsimile cannot replicate the intricacy and delicacy of a truly democratic system, entrenched in culture, assembled from millions of interlocking parts. Laws and parliaments are the scaffolding that support countless civic acts, each one affirming the faith that ours is a political system that exists for the benefit of the people, not a conspiracy against them. Anyone who has lived under both types of government can easily tell the difference.</p> <p>\u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist</p>",

He describes attending college among mainly black people and then stepping into a white world when he took up a degree in architecture. These experiences he says, helped \u201cinform a world view\u201d.</p> <p>He first conceived the idea in 2018 after his project to develop a studio for the local creative community in Peckham High Street stalled because of difficulties with the council and others over the building. Williams turned his frustration into positive action by launching a campaign to help black men change their own narrative.</p> <p>The portraits were a powerful way to attract attention and start a conversation. He chose 56 because this was how many <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/black-murder-victims-and-suspects-london-v-uk-11443656\" title=\"\">black men </a><a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/black-murder-victims-and-suspects-london-v-uk-11443656\" title=\"\">were murder</a><a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/black-murder-victims-and-suspects-london-v-uk-11443656\" title=\"\">ed in London in 2018</a>. </p> <p>\u201cThe premise really is for black men and boys to see ourselves amplified in a positive light for once,\u201d he says. He adds that 56 Black Men has become a \u201cmovement\u201d. Williams, who gives talks on issues around diversity and inclusion to FTSE 100 companies, says: \u201cThere are so many other positive black men out there doing stuff like this who don\u2019t get seen, who don\u2019t get the support they need. Instead of their efforts being highlighted, we\u2019re always talking about the negative portrayal of black men.\u201d With this in mind, Williams has big ambitions as the project enters its second year. He wants to raise funds to bring black men to the stage to tell their stories through \u201c56 Black Men Live\u201d events. An initial show held at Theatre Peckham in October, he says, was a success, but he hopes shows will be run at high-profile venues such as the National Theatre in the long run.</p> <p>Williams says: \u201c56 Black Men wants to bring storytelling to the stage, part of the reason being that we want black men to be in control of their own narrative.\u201d </p> <p>Williams is also planning a campaign against racism in football in the form of another portrait series featuring black men connected by their love for the sport. At the same time, he is working with City companies to create an \u201cexperience exchange\u201d to give black men direct access to business leaders in the City and other industries. It will help address the problem of black men feeling as if they do not necessarily fit the mould to work in these industries and also change stereotypical perceptions among chief executives and other decision-makers.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people live on one side of the river and these black boys live on the other side of the river \u2013 and they never get to have a real conversation.

  "<p>Mayibout 2 is not a healthy place. The 150 or so people who live in the village, which sits on the south bank of the Ivindo River, deep in the great Minkebe Forest in northern Gabon, are used to occasional bouts of diseases such as malaria, dengue, yellow fever and sleeping sickness. Mostly they shrug them off.</p> <p>But in January 1996, Ebola, a deadly virus then barely known to humans, unexpectedly <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/group/virus/filo/eboz.html\">spilled out of the forest</a> in a wave of small epidemics. The disease killed 21 of 37 villagers who were reported to have been infected, including a number who had carried, skinned, chopped or eaten a chimpanzee from the nearby forest.</p> <p>I travelled to Mayibout 2 in 2004 to investigate why deadly diseases new to humans were emerging from biodiversity \u201chotspots\u201d such as tropical rainforests and bushmeat markets in African and Asian cities.</p> <p>It took a day by canoe and then many hours along degraded forest logging roads, passing Baka villages and a small goldmine, to reach the village. There, I found traumatised people still fearful that the deadly virus, <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ebola-virus-disease\">which kills up to 90% of the people it infects</a>, would return.</p> <p>Villagers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/jun/17/research.highereducation\">told me</a> how children had gone into the forest with dogs that had killed the chimp. They said that everyone who cooked or ate it got a terrible fever within a few hours. Some died immediately, while others were taken down the river to hospital. A few, like Nesto Bematsick, recovered. \u201cWe used to love the forest, now we fear it,\u201d he told me. Many of Bematsick\u2019s family members died.</p> <p>Only a decade or two ago it was widely thought that tropical forests and intact natural environments teeming with exotic wildlife threatened humans by harbouring the viruses and pathogens that lead to new diseases in humans such as Ebola, HIV and dengue.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"534439589013db887e7fa1406abf8578b274a1ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/534439589013db887e7fa1406abf8578b274a1ba/0_0_1157_868/1000.jpg\" alt=\"3D print of a spike protein and a Covid-19 virus particle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A 3D print of a spike protein and a Covid-19 virus particle.

In fact, a new discipline, planetary health, is emerging that focuses on the increasingly visible connections between the wellbeing of humans, other living things and entire ecosystems.</p> <p>Is it possible, then, that it was human activity, such as road building, mining, hunting and logging, that triggered the Ebola epidemics in Mayibout 2 and elsewhere in the 1990s and that is unleashing new terrors today?</p> <p>\u201cWe invade tropical forests and other wild landscapes, which harbour so many species of animals and plants \u2013 and within those creatures, so many unknown viruses,\u201d David Quammen, author of Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Pandemic, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/opinion/coronavirus-china.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytopinion\">recently wrote</a> in the New York Times. \u201cWe cut the trees; we kill the animals or cage them and send them to markets.

The disruption of pristine forests driven by logging, mining, <a href=\"https://ensia.com/voices/if-our-planet-had-a-say-heres-where-future-roads-would-go/\">road building through remote places</a>, rapid urbanisation and population growth is bringing people into closer contact with animal species they may never have been near before, she says.</p> <p>The resulting transmission of disease from wildlife to humans, she says, is now \u201ca hidden cost of human economic development. There are just so many more of us, in every environment. We are going into largely undisturbed places and being exposed more and more. We are creating habitats where viruses are transmitted more easily, and then we are surprised that we have new ones.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3211500b6543b8895ad19f09465e0c743057e0c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3211500b6543b8895ad19f09465e0c743057e0c9/0_0_2224_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Jones\" width=\"1000\" height=\"899\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate Jones warns of \u2018a very significant threat to global health, security and economies\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Kate Jones</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jones studies how changes in land use contribute to the risk. \u201cWe are researching how species in degraded habitats are likely to carry more viruses which can infect humans,\u201d she says. \u201cSimpler systems get an amplification effect. Destroy landscapes, and the species you are left with are the ones humans get the diseases from.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are countless pathogens out there continuing to evolve which at some point could pose a threat to humans,\u201d says Eric Fevre, chair of veterinary infectious diseases at the University of Liverpool\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.liv.ac.uk/infection-and-global-health/\">Institute of Infection and Global Health</a>. \u201cThe risk [of pathogens jumping from animals to humans] has always been there.\u201d</p> <p>The difference between now and a few decades ago, Fevre says, is that diseases are likely to spring up in both urban and natural environments. \u201cWe have created densely packed populations where alongside us are bats and rodents and birds, pets and other living things. That creates intense interaction and opportunities for things to move from species to species,\u201d he says.<br></p> <h2><strong>Tip of the iceberg</strong></h2> <p>\u201cPathogens do not respect species boundaries,\u201d says disease ecologist Thomas Gillespie, an associate professor in Emory University\u2019s <a href=\"http://envs.emory.edu/home/index.html\"> department of </a><a href=\"http://envs.emory.edu/home/index.html\"> environmental </a><a href=\"http://envs.emory.edu/home/index.html\"> sciences</a>, who studies how shrinking natural habitats and changing behaviour add to the risk of diseases spilling over from animals to humans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"792b34357582632dc1d898ebd5ea4f3008eca057\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/792b34357582632dc1d898ebd5ea4f3008eca057/0_0_3129_2693/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomas Gillespie with primatologist Jane Goodall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"861\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Disease ecologist Thomas Gillespie with primatologist Jane Goodall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Thomas Gillespie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI am not at all surprised about the coronavirus outbreak,\u201d he says. \u201cThe majority of pathogens are still to be discovered. We are at the very tip of the iceberg.\u201d</p> <p>Humans, says Gillespie, are creating the conditions for the spread of diseases by reducing the natural barriers between host animals \u2013 in which the virus is naturally circulating \u2013 and themselves. \u201cWe fully expect the arrival of pandemic influenza; we can expect large-scale human mortalities; we can expect other pathogens with other impacts. A disease like Ebola is not easily spread. But something with a mortality rate of Ebola spread by something like measles would be catastrophic,\u201d Gillespie says.</p> <p>Wildlife everywhere is being put under more stress, he says. \u201cMajor landscape changes are causing animals to lose habitats, which means species become crowded together and also come into greater contact with humans. Species that survive change are now moving and mixing with different animals and with humans.\u201d</p> <p>Gillespie sees this in the US, where suburbs fragment forests and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/19/lyme-disease-pentagon-tick-bite-climate-crisis\">raise the risk of humans contracting Lyme disease</a>. \u201cAltering the ecosystem affects the complex cycle of the Lyme pathogen.

He and others are developing the emerging discipline of planetary health, which looks at the links between human and ecosystem health.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s misapprehension among scientists and the public that natural ecosystems are the source of threats to ourselves. It\u2019s a mistake. Nature poses threats, it is true, but it\u2019s human activities that do the real damage. The health risks in a natural environment can be made much worse when we interfere with it,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Ostfeld points to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/rodents/diseases/direct.html\">rats</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/transmission/index.html\">bats</a>, which are strongly linked with the direct and indirect spread of zoonotic diseases. \u201cRodents and some bats thrive when we disrupt natural habitats. They are the most likely to promote transmissions [of pathogens]. The more we disturb the forests and habitats the more danger we are in,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Felicia Keesing, professor of biology at Bard College, New York, studies how environmental changes influence the probability that humans will be exposed to infectious diseases. \u201cWhen we erode biodiversity, we see a proliferation of the species most likely to transmit <em>new</em> diseases to us, but there\u2019s also good evidence that those same species are the best hosts for <em>existing</em> diseases,\u201d she wrote in an email to Ensia, the nonprofit media outlet that reports on our changing planet.</p> <h2><strong>The market connection</strong></h2> <p>Disease ecologists argue that viruses and other pathogens are also likely to move from animals to humans in the many informal markets that have sprung up to provide fresh meat to fast-growing urban populations around the world. Here, animals are slaughtered, cut up and sold on the spot.</p> <p>The \u201cwet market\u201d (one that sells fresh produce and meat) in Wuhan, thought by the Chinese government to be the starting point of the current Covid-19 pandemic, was known to sell <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/24/calls-for-global-ban-wild-animal-markets-amid-coronavirus-outbreak\">numerous wild animals</a>, including live wolf pups, salamanders, crocodiles, scorpions, rats, squirrels, foxes, civets and turtles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7924ef86a71e43dd45752f7fa40fa9296b49a674\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7924ef86a71e43dd45752f7fa40fa9296b49a674/0_0_4134_2751/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dead pangolins seized in North Sumatra\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dead pangolins seized by authorities in North Sumatra.

But bans on live animals being sold in urban areas or informal markets are not the answer, say some scientists.</p> <p>\u201cThe wet market in Lagos is notorious. It\u2019s like a nuclear bomb waiting to happen. But it\u2019s not fair to demonise places which do not have fridges. These traditional markets provide much of the food for Africa and Asia,\u201d says Jones.</p> <p>\u201cThese markets are essential sources of food for hundreds of millions of poor people, and getting rid of them is impossible,\u201d says Delia Grace, a senior epidemiologist and veterinarian with the International Livestock Research Institute, which is based in Nairobi, Kenya. She argues that bans force traders underground, where they may pay less attention to hygiene.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4ee8bc908e56cfcb2ed9f02d9882e8d64ce21c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4ee8bc908e56cfcb2ed9f02d9882e8d64ce21c7/0_0_4527_2939/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bushmeat stall in Equatorial Guinea\" width=\"1000\" height=\"649\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bushmeat stall with pangolins, bush rats and tiger cats for sale on the roadside outside Bata in Equatorial Guinea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl de Souza/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fevre and colleague Cecilia Tacoli, principal researcher in the human settlements research group at the International Institute of Environment and Development (IIED), <a href=\"https://www.iied.org/coronavirus-threat-looms-large-for-low-income-cities\">argue in a blog post</a> that rather than pointing the finger at wet markets, we should look at the burgeoning trade in wild animals.</p> <p>\u201cIt is wild animals rather than farmed animals that are the natural hosts of many viruses,\u201d they write. \u201cWet markets are considered part of the informal food trade that is often blamed for contributing to spreading disease. But \u2026 evidence shows the link between informal markets and disease <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956247819866124\">is not always so clear cut</a>.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Changing behaviour</strong></h2> <p>So what, if anything, can we do about all of this?</p> <p>Jones says that change must come from both rich and poor societies. Demand for wood, minerals and resources from the global north leads to the degraded landscapes and ecological disruption that drives disease, she says. \u201cWe must think about global biosecurity, find the weak points and bolster the provision of health care in developing countries. Otherwise we can expect more of the same,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>\u201cThe risks are greater now. They were always present and have been there for generations. It is our interactions with that risk which must be changed,\u201d says Brian Bird, a research virologist at the University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine One Health Institute, where he leads Ebola-related surveillance activities in Sierra Leone and elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cWe are in an era now of chronic emergency,\u201d Bird says. \u201cDiseases are more likely to travel further and faster than before, which means we must be faster in our responses. It needs investments, change in human behaviour, and it means we must listen to people at community levels.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2f9e56c9f23da7cc5b01497fd7cc87838b5374b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f9e56c9f23da7cc5b01497fd7cc87838b5374b1/0_331_5000_3002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A poster in Beijing promoting wildlife as friends instead of food\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A poster in Beijing promoting wildlife as friends instead of food, after a crackdown on wild animal markets following the coronavirus outbreak.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Wong/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Getting the message about pathogens and disease to hunters, loggers, market traders and consumers is key, Bird says. \u201cThese spillovers start with one or two people. The solutions start with education and awareness. We must make people aware things are different now. I have learned from working in Sierra Leone with Ebola-affected people that local communities have the hunger and desire to have information,\u201d he says. \u201cThey want to know what to do.

The results from today\u2019s election would never be considered legitimate under normal circumstances with poll locations closing with no notification, poll workers not showing up for fear of their lives, and other locations being consolidated which all but ensures that voters in those locations will be gathered in groups larger than the 50 maximum limit suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p> <p>But here we are, with a party that is so desperate to put the progressive movement down that it would risk the lives of their voters to go to the polls during a national emergency. There will be a rush to \u201cvalidate\u201d this election, but any reasonable observer engaging in good faith would confess that not postponing the primaries or, at a minimum, extending the primaries and allowing the voter to continue voting by mail constitutes voter suppression.</p> <ul> <li><p>Benjamin Dixon is the host of the Benjamin Dixon podcast</p></li> </ul> <h2>Jessa Crispin: \u2018Welcome to voting in time of social distancing\u2019</h2> <p>All day, there were reports of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/madeleinedupre/status/1239898696227094528\">primary</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rachel_joyy/status/1239963191972511746\">voting</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sebaasilv/status/1239983086668046337\">mishaps</a>. Polling places were not open, workers and volunteers did not show up, and there did not seem to be safety precautions in place in several locations to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Talking heads were saying how important it was to continue the primary process, but meanwhile, newspapers and politicians implored the citizenry to <a href=\"https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/gov-pritzker-reiterates-plea-for-people-to-stay-home-due-to-coronavirus/2237275/\">STAY HOME</a>. Kind of getting some mixed messages here, guys. I don\u2019t know if Chicago should have forced everyone who showed up to the St Patrick\u2019s Day pub crawls to man the polls, but probably we should have had some sort of Plan B procedure for voting during a national state of emergency.</p> <p>So basically, why are we doing this? And why are we pretending the results today are real and full?</p> <p>But even before the pandemic, we saw terrible voting conditions for months. States like Texas <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/02/texas-polling-sites-closures-voting\">closed hundreds of polling stations</a>, making voters wait for hours in line. We saw <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2020/03/08/large-texas-county-seeks-super-tuesday-recount-after-discovery-of-uncounted-ballots_partner/\">ballots go uncounted</a>. And that\u2019s bad enough without talking about mass disenfranchisement and the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/12/20/790319853/are-states-purging-or-cleaning-voter-registration-rolls\">purging of voter registration rolls</a>.</p> <p>As I watched CNN for the primary results, I saw more outrage about roller-bladers in San Francisco breaking the call for social distancing \u2013 I really thought Jake Tapper might break down weeping when a kid walking around what should have been empty streets gave a thumbs up to the camera \u2013 than I saw about the difficulties people have had voting today. Then Biden gave some victory speech with all the vim and vigor of a man shuffling to the refrigerator in the middle of the night to see if there\u2019s any pudding left, and I really felt, you know, the healing of the nation or whatever.</p> <p>I\u2019m worried Sanders supporters will use these voting difficulties only to question the legitimacy of the results. What it should do instead is invigorate the left vote to organize around massive voting reform.

Indeed, the Delaware Democrat captured the votes of white people without college degrees, a prize that eluded Clinton and a bloc Donald Trump calls his own. A global pandemic and a market crash will sorely test the president\u2019s hold.</p> <p>As for Sanders, his quest has morphed into the quixotic, an exercise in rule or ruin, or all of the above.

While Biden performed well in Illinois, turnout was down on 2016, probably due to coronavirus fears. The postponement of the</p> <p>Ohio primary means we have been denied another opportunity to assess Biden\u2019s strength in the Midwest.</p> <p>Extensive early voting and vote-by-mail options allowed turnout in Florida to actually rise on 2016, which seems to bode well for Democratic enthusiasm in the general election \u2013 especially if we assume that turnout would have been even higher without coronavirus fears.</p> <p>Had the Democratic primary still been competitive going into Tuesday\u2019s contests, serious questions could be raised about the impact of the virus on the results \u2013 and given that the answers to these questions rest on such intangibles as why turnout was down, they would be very difficult to answer.</p> <p>It is vital that the integrity and legitimacy of the November election be maintained even if the coronavirus pandemic is ongoing. Extensive preparations should be made, starting now, to ensure that alternatives to in-person voting exist. A lot rests on what happens on that single day in November \u2013 it is imperative that America gets it right.</p> <ul> <li><p>Andrew Gawthorpe is a historian of the United State at Leiden University</p></li> </ul>",

How are you all doing? Today was my kid\u2019s seventh birthday. We were supposed to have a party but that became a dinner at a restaurant which became a dinner at home with a single friend which, in the end, became TOTAL LOCKDOWN when we made the call to isolate completely at home for the next week without friends or playdates. Each time we cancelled the birthday plan and replaced it with something more restrictive and lonely, he fell apart. But then, each time, he collected himself and moved on. He\u2019s a ray of light and fortitude. I\u2019m so lucky to be his mom. I hope all you other Americans are staying home this week as much as you possibly can. By all accounts, this moment is critical. If we\u2019re going to flatten that curve, we need to do it this week and we need to do it by staying away from each other. Please, please, stay home if you have the privilege to do it. Some of us have to go to work. Some of us have to help those in need. But a lot of us can stay in and deprive this virus of more human fodder and it\u2019s our duty to do it. Meanwhile, I\u2019m thinking of ways that we can stay connected here through art. I\u2019ll keep posting drawing prompts on Tuesdays but I\u2019d like to post art assignments more often than that because we\u2019re all going to be more isolated than usual. Many of us just became unwitting homeschool teachers to our kids. Many of us will be home all alone for a while. Let\u2019s keep busy. I\u2019ll try to post assignments every day this week that you can do on your own or with your family. Let me know if you have drawing exercises you love and I\u2019ll share them. Okay! Watch this spot for the first assignment on Monday and stay safe. Check in with your neighbors and wash your hands. \u2764\ufe0f</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/carsonellis/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Carson</a> (@carsonellis) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-03-15T05:58:40+00:00\">Mar 14, 2020 at 10:58pm PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking of ways that we can stay connected here through art,\u201d she wrote <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B9vk-NwJSDS/\">in a post on Monday</a>. \u201cWe\u2019re all going to be more isolated than usual.

The agreement allows EU countries to band together to use their combined purchasing power to get a good deal on vaccines and other medical supplies.</p> \n  <p>The EU executive is organising joint procurement of protective clothing for medics, including masks, as well as ventilators. The commission spokesperson said \u201ca very big majority of member states [were] interested\u201d in taking part in the joint procurement on ventilators. The British government has not revealed whether it intends to take part in any of the procurement schemes.</p> \n  <p>On Monday, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/16/vauxhall-owner-psa-car-shuts-european-plants-amid-coronavirus-fears\">urged British industry to step forward and build 20,000 ventilators \u201cat speed\u201d</a>. The NHS has 5,900 ventilators, but might need more than three times as many in the worst-case scenario for the spread of Covid-19.</p> \n  <p>The UK will be expected to apply EU-wide restrictions on the export of medical goods outside the bloc, passed in emergency legislation on Sunday. For a period of six weeks, EU countries and the UK will have to seek approval to export critical medical supplies outside the bloc.</p> \n  <p>Later on Tuesday, EU leaders are expected to adopt a 30-day travel ban on non-EU citizens entering the union, but the commission has said restrictions will not apply to the UK. There are exemptions for residents, diplomats, healthcare workers and researchers, and people delivering goods.</p> \n  <p>The UK and <strong>Ireland</strong>, neither in the EU\u2019s Schengen passport-free travel zone, are being \u201cencouraged\u201d to enforce the travel ban.</p> \n  <p> A UK spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK can choose whether to opt in to this proposal if it is agreed.

Our first priority is non-negotiable: to save lives,\u201d he told Greeks in a televised speech from his Maximos office. \u201cThat is why, much earlier than other European countries, we enforced measures that are unprecedented in peacetime. And we are continuing in that direction.\u201d </p> \n  <p>So far, Greek health authorities have announced 387 confirmed cases of coronavirus, revealing this afternoon that a fifth person had fallen victim to Covid-19. There were 35 new cases in the last 24 hours, the health ministry spokesman and infectious disease expert professor Sotiris Tsiodras told reporters. Of the total number, 11 were in intensive care, he said. </p> \n  <p>Fearing the fate of Italy, the centre-right government has threatened to be merciless with those who flout tough restrictions that as of Wednesday will also include all shops being closed across Greece, with the exception of supermarkets.

Trials of the drug, which are necessarily thorough, including checking its efficacy and potential side effects, mean that even if approved, it is not likely to be available until next spring.</p> \n  <p>It spent the first 15 minutes, though, attempting to quash the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/trump-offers-large-sums-for-exclusive-access-to-coronavirus-vaccine\">reports</a> in recent days according to which the company had been approached by the US government with an offer to exclusively buy up the vaccine it is working on, for one billion dollars. </p> \n  <p>First, to those rumours, the companies managers said they were just that. They categorically denied there was any truth in them, explaining that company bosses had been invited at extremely short notice to visit the White House last week, and speak to US government officials, along with representatives of other international companies working on coronavirus vaccines. This is despite the fact that the German interior minister, foreign minister, even the chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the owner of CureVac, Dietmar Hopp, had commented on the reports as if they had been true, saying that \u201cGermany is not for sale\u201d. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThis technology (to make the vaccine) can be applicable for anyone and there have not been requests for us to do it exclusively for the US,\u201d CureVac\u2019s deputy CEO Franz-Werner Haas told journalists. \u201cWe did not talk to Maas (the foreign minister) or Seehofer (the interior minister) so we cannot comment on that.\u201d</p> \n  <p>CureVac is a 20 year old company which develops therapies based on the molecule messenger RNA (mRNA) and has specialised in developing vaccines for infectious diseases as well as on drugs to treat cancer. Mariola Fotin-Mletczek, PhD, chief technology officer, explained the vaccine technology she is currently working on. \u201cNature has very good mechanisms for fighting against pathogens - viruses and bacteria - and with our technology we mimic nature\u2019s approach,\u201d she said. \u201cThe way we formulate this messenger molecule means it mimics this virus situation. </p> \n  <p>This means that we induce the immune response which is very similar to the natural immune response. With our approach, messenger RNA encodes one specific protein from the virus, the critical one, which is sufficient to mobilise the immune system. We do this in such a way that we use this natural mechanism which really helps to induce and to produce huge amounts of potent anti-bodies which neutralise the virus. </p> \n  <p>And that is exactly what we saw in the trial with our latest vaccine based on exactly the same technology. Also here we see that two doses of one microgram are sufficient to mobilise the immune system in the right way and to induce production of protective antibodies above the defined threshold, which means protection.\u201dShe said that laboratory trials on the vaccine would start in April and clinical trials would begin in the early summer.</p> \n  <p>The company has received an 80 million Euro grant from the European Commission in the last few days, which will enable it to \u201caccelerate the upscaling of a manufacturing unit which would produce the vaccine which is already being built,\u201d according to Florian von der M\u00fclbe, chief production officer and co-founder of CureVac. </p> \n  <p>This means once it got the go-ahead, the company could potentially produce high quantities of the drug so that it could be made available worldwide. The production facilities could be replicated easily elsewhere, increasing the efficiency and speed with which it could be made available, he added.</p> \n  <p>Lothar Wieler, president of the Robert Koch Institute, the main public health body in Germany, said earlier today, the concept was based on tumour therapy, with the vaccine \u201creacting to the protein in the virus and receiving an answer from it\u201d. It is a technology already used to fight cancers, he said. \u201cIf it works, it would be amazing,\u201d he said, calling the technology \u201cfast, cheap and efficient\u201d. But based on current information, and he would not expect a vaccine to be ready until next spring.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e70ee018f085e564ad85d05\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/benquinn\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-17T15:39:53.572Z\">3.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/coronavirus-france-on-war-footing-as-europe-locks-down-macron\">\u2022 The EU is set to endorse the strictest travel ban in its history as France joined Italy and Spain in full lockdown and Donald Trump told Americans to change their behaviour, acknowledging for the first time that beating the coronavirus could take months.</a><br>EU leaders are expected on Tuesday to suspend all travel into the passport-free Schengen zone by non-EU nationals for at least 30 days in a bid to instil uniformity across the bloc after some member states, including Austria, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland, unilaterally began imposing border checks.<br></p> \n  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/trump-calls-covid-19-the-chinese-virus-as-rift-with-coronavirus-beijing-escalates\">\u2022 Donald Trump has referred to the coronavirus as \u201cthe Chinese virus\u201d, escalating a deepening US-China diplomatic spat over the outbreak.</a></strong><br>After giving an address on Monday warning of a possible recession, the US president posted on Twitter: \u201cThe United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus.

Sorry to say that I, today, have tested positive for COVID19, Corona virus. My familiy and I are self-isolating at home for as long as it takes. We are in good health - I only have mild symptoms of a cold. There are people at higher risk for who this virus might be a devastating diagnosis, so I urge all of you to be extremely careful; wash your hands, keep 1,5 meters distance from others, go in quarantine; just do everything you can to stop the virus from spreading. Together we can fight this virus and avert a crisis at our hospitals. Please take care of each other, keep your distance, and stay healthy! Please visit your country&amp;#39;s Center for Disease Control&amp;#39;s website, and follow the regulations for staying safe and protecting not just yourselves, but our entire community, and especially those at risk like the elderly and people with pre-existing conditions. @grymolvaerhivju #fightcorona #solidarity #takecare #folkehelseinstituttet Thanks to @panoramaagency</a></p> <p style=&quot;

The question is: How? </p> \n  <p>Here is a summary of the latest developments:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The head of the World Health Organizaion, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, implored governments to test more suspected cases, </strong>warning that they cannot fight the pandemic blindfolded.<strong> </strong>In a strongly-worded attack on governments which have neglected or held back testing, he said: \u201cWe have not seen an urgent enough escalation in testing, isolation and contact tracing, which is the backbone of the response.\u201d<br></li> \n   <li><strong>The White House recommended isolation.</strong> US President Donald Trump told Americans to avoid any gatherings of more than 10 people over the next 15 days and advising all states with evidence of community transmission to close down bars, restaurants, gyms and other facilities.</li> \n   <li><strong>The death toll in Italy from Covid-19 increased to 2,158, with the announcement of another 349 victims in Europe\u2019s worst his country.</strong> Spain confirmed 9,191 cases and 309 deaths, making it the second hardest-hit country in Europe after Italy.</li> \n   <li><strong>The death toll in the UK increased to 55 people, including the first death in Wales</strong>. The latest victims included a 56-year-old, believed to be the youngest in the UK so far.</li> \n   <li><strong>Britons were told to avoid pubs, bars and restaurants and to self-isolate if anyone in their family fell ill.</strong> The new government advice, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/pm-tells-britons-to-avoid-non-essential-contact-with-others\">something of a U-turn</a>, came during the prime minister\u2019s first daily press conference. Boris Johnson unveiled a series of stringent new restrictions, including a 14-day isolation for all households with symptoms, a warning against \u201cnon-essential\u201d contact, and an end to all mass gatherings. </li> \n   <li><strong> </strong><strong>The G7 nations stressed the importance of international cooperation.</strong> A statement released by Downing Street sought to highlight the significance of national governments not looking solely to their own interests \u2013 acknowledging that coronavirus is a global pandemic.</li> \n   <li><strong> </strong><strong>Germany closed places of worship, bars, restaurants, museums and cinemas. </strong>Announcing the plan, Chancellor Angela Merkel said: \u201cThe more individuals stick to these rules, the quicker we will get through this phase.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>The actor Idris Elba has become the latest celebrity to contract the virus</strong>.

Infections have been reported in 156 countries.</li> \n   <li><strong>In the UK, an NHS document leaked to the media suggested that the coronavirus emergency could last up to a year </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/uk-coronavirus-crisis-to-last-until-spring-2021-and-could-see-79m-hospitalised\">and put 8m people in hospital</a>.

Any prosecution would require the consent of the attorney general before it could proceed.</p> <p>The latest Ministry of Defence initiative follows intense political debates over long-running investigations into former soldiers.

The proposals are nonetheless likely to be scrutinised carefully by human rights groups.</p> <p>The MoD says military operations in Iraq resulted in nearly 1,000 compensation claims against the department for unlawful detention, personal injury and death. There were also approximately 1,400 judicial review claims against the MoD seeking investigations and compensation for a variety of alleged human rights violations.</p> <p>The new law will also require a court to consider the operational context when deciding whether to extend the normal time limits for bringing civil claims for personal injury or death and for bringing claims under the Human Rights Act in connection with military operations overseas.</p> <p>An \u201cabsolute maximum of six years\u201d time limit would also be imposed for bringing civil claims in connection with overseas operations.</p> <p>Future governments will also be \u201ccompelled to consider derogating from the European convention on human rights in relation to significant overseas military operations\u201d \u2013 a proposal that has been raised before.</p>"
