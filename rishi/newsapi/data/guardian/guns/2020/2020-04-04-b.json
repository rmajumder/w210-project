  "<p>Whatever plans Simon Bridges had to convince New Zealanders that he should be their next prime minister are \u2013 nominally at least \u2013 on hold. Bridges, the leader of the parliamentary opposition and of the centre-right National party, suspended campaigning for September\u2019s poll last month as lawmakers across the political spectrum united to endorse a four-week shutdown over the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>But despite the cross-party display of support for measures to combat the virus\u2019 spread, politics for Bridges is never far away. A post on his Facebook page is soliciting support for his call to quarantine everyone entering New Zealand \u2013 currently, the government is allowing some to self-isolate at home \u2013 and urges the public to message him directly with their problems or complaints during the lockdown.</p> <p>And Bridges, 43, has jumped at the opportunity, in his new position as leader of a parliamentary committee scrutinising the government\u2019s decisions on Covid-19, to grill those in power.</p> <p>\u201cI think actually the scrutiny and the sunlight\u2019s working,\u201d he told a radio interviewer on Friday, referring to the committee\u2019s daily sittings, held on a publicly livestreamed video call. \u201cWe\u2019re dragging out more openness and transparency behind the press conferences.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/27/new-zealand-national-party-elects-maori-leader-jacindamania\">New Zealand: National party elects Maori leader and deputy to take on Jacindamania</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jacinda Ardern, the country\u2019s prime minister \u2013 an adroit and empathetic communicator \u2013 is in her element in a crisis, and one of the world\u2019s most popular leaders. But if an election is held in September as scheduled, Bridges told the Guardian in a February interview that he was not worried about his rival\u2019s global profile.</p> <p>\u201cI see when I go overseas, our prime minister \u2013 and therefore the government \u2013 has this strong reputation and that\u2019s amazing,\u201d he says,upbeat but underscored by his trademark bluntness, on a couch in his office at New Zealand\u2019s parliament. \u201cBut of course for New Zealanders at home, that international work is only so good as your domestic record and that is, I clearly think, lacking.\u201d</p> <h2>Pitching economic clout</h2> <p>Like Ardern, Bridges has a young family at home. His three children \u2013 aged seven, five and two \u2013 and wife Natalie live in the port city of Tauranga in the Bay of Plenty in the North Island. He has brought to Wellington the relaxed, casual demeanour of the beachfront city, though he admits he has no life beyond politics, his family, and a little Netflix, and has never learned to surf.</p> <p>But where Ardern has built a reputation for exhorting a politics of kindness, Bridges is painted by his detractors as too negative, not likeable enough, maladroit in sensitive situations. The former prosecutor \u2013 who almost burned out in the job because, he tells the Guardian, he obsessed over each case he presented before a court \u2013 says that depiction of him is wrong.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone has a monopoly on compassion,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it\u2019s always what people say that defines that. I think it is one\u2019s acts in government that show that.\u201d</p> <p>While polling data has not been published since Ardern shut down the country last Wednesday \u2013 a move that was widely supported to combat Covid-19, but is expected to deepen a recession forecast for the country \u2013 a <a href=\"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12308451\">1News Colmar Brunton poll in February</a> suggested it would be Bridges\u2019 National that would form the government after a vote in September, with a razor-thin, two-seat majority over the left-wing coalition led by Labour.</p> <p>But that was when the threat of Covid-19 still felt far from New Zealand\u2019s shores; now, the vote is likely to come down to whether people believe Ardern\u2019s party or Bridges\u2019 can better steer New Zealand\u2019s ship through an economic shock expected to be worse than the 2008 global financial crisis.</p> <p>Bridges is making the pitch that it\u2019s him. An economic speech touted as the centrepiece of his election-year pitch in February promised lower taxes, more jobs, boosts to GDP and debt reduction. As the impact of the pandemic became apparent in the past month, Bridges told the Guardian those pledges remained \u2013 and that Covid-19 \u201ccalls for more boldness in our actions\u201d on the economy.</p> <p>While New Zealanders are often uncomfortable with displays of naked ambition, he says Ardern\u2019s wish for the country \u2013 that everyone might have the basics for life covered \u2013 is \u201cnot remotely ambitious and aspirational enough\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI want my three children to be world beaters,\u201d he says. \u201cI know with an English wife that they have options and I don\u2019t want them to spend their adult years in the UK. I want this to be a world beating economy and country where they can \u2026 not just exist happily but thrive.\u201d</p> <p>Bridges and his party are not centre-right in the way some comparable countries understand the term; the lawmaker is a full-throated supporter of New Zealand\u2019s free healthcare and schooling systems, and says he would consider climate change in his economic proposals were he prime minister. But in other ways he is an inveterate conservative: he believes New Zealanders will vote for lower taxes, would not use the term \u201cclimate emergency\u201d and disagrees with what he calls \u201cpreaching\u201d on the topic in schools.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/13/new-zealand-schools-to-teach-students-about-climate-crisis-activism-and-eco-anxiety\">New Zealand schools to teach students about climate crisis, activism and 'eco anxiety'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He recalls a former parliamentary colleague telling visiting Americans that \u201cin New Zealand, the Labour party\u2019s like the Democrats and the National party\u2019s like the Democrats\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t overly caricature it, but New Zealanders, I think, are a caring, compassionate society \u2013 dare I say it, and maybe I\u2019ll regret saying this, but I think a bit more so than [Australia].\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018I also have a moral obligation to ask hard questions\u2019</h2> <p>When the Guardian met Bridges in February, he expected the election to be close, but was buoyant about his chances. He is relaxed and familiar in conversation, with a tendency to warn that he is about to be candid, or to say something he \u201cmight later regret,\u201d before voicing an entirely uncontroversial opinion in line with his political views. It is \u201ccandid\u201d, for example, for him to suggest that people might vote for Labour come September because Ardern, in her first term as leader, is \u201ca nice person\u201d with good intentions and deserves another chance, even if they don\u2019t feel the government has delivered on its promises, particularly on the country\u2019s housing crisis.</p> <p>September\u2019s poll will be Bridges\u2019 first as National and opposition leader; he won the role after Bill English stepped down in 2018.</p> <p>Seen as a bright, young talent during National\u2019s time in power, Bridges entered parliament as a 32-year-old lawmaker who was Oxford-educated \u2013 but the son of a clergyman and a school teacher \u2013 telegenic and with a politically enviable background prosecuting criminals. He was awarded frequent promotions and hefty portfolios, becoming minister for transport and economic development.</p> <p>New Zealand\u2019s politicians, when interviewed \u2013 perhaps cautious of the public\u2019s preference for humility in leaders \u2013 often protest that they dislike parliament; it\u2019s a necessary evil, not something they would ever choose. Bridges enjoys it.</p> <p>\u201cI think once you understand that it\u2019s a place of theatre, it\u2019s symbolically very important that arguments in parliament are good,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He is less sanguine about brickbats from \u201cthe left and the Twitterati\u201d that he says frequently misconstrue his positions. In contrast to Ardern \u2013 who frequently receives glowing media attention for her party\u2019s social media posts, and has called all New Zealand\u2019s leaders to commit to factual and transparent campaigning, which Bridges says he supports \u2013 his party, he says, is nitpicked unfairly.</p> <p>\u201cThey seek to hold National to a higher standard of these things and are on the lookout for it every second of the day,\u201d he says. He is sometimes accused by his critics of inappropriately politicising situations; where Ardern plays politics, but subtly, his speeches are often battering rams.</p> <p>\u201cI think they are unfair,\u201d he says of reproaches that he should not have criticised the government over its initial Covid-19 response. \u201cI have often been constructive but I also have a moral obligation to ask hard questions and push the government along for the good of New Zealand.\u201d</p> <p>Bridges laughs off questions of whether he is likeable enough to lead National to victory; he has previously said it is <a href=\"https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/likeability-doesnt-make-good-pm-bridges-says-while-shrugging-off-negative-approval-rating\">not an essential trait in a prime minister</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ee0253c4f8c48933d4835e90a7122d96cca24be2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee0253c4f8c48933d4835e90a7122d96cca24be2/0_18_3960_2376/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Bridges, Winston Peters and Jacinda Ardern attend Waitangi Day celebrations\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Bridges (far left), Winston Peters and Jacinda Ardern attend Waitangi Day celebrations on 4 February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fiona Goodall/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m more worried sometimes that I\u2019m not overly hardened to valid criticism and that I have some sensitivity there,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t get worked up about what Mrs Jones says to me in an email or what I read on Twitter but I do want to be sensitive enough that where they\u2019re saying you\u2019ve got that wrong, and you can improve in this way, I seek to do that.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s an example?</p> <p>\u201cI wear better-fitting suits these days,\u201d he says.</p> <p>When Bridges meets aspiring political candidates, he tries to dissuade them from running for office if they are already doing well in their careers. But he does not regret his move to leave the courtroom behind.</p> <p>\u201cYou think you really enjoy something and certainly I found it satisfying, but the day I resigned to be the Tauranga candidate for the National party, a weight lifted off my shoulders,\u201d Bridges says.</p> <p>\u201cI used to find sleeping quite hard when I was in cases, I\u2019d always have my cross examination and my closing arguments rolling over my head, because I wanted to get it perfect for the jury and the victim.</p> <p>\u201cAs my wife would attest, now in politics I sleep like a baby.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump has directly urged Americans worried about Covid-19 to take a little-studied anti-malaria drug for the disease, despite potentially serious side effects and a lack of data on safety and efficacy in treatment of the pandemic virus.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/04/trump-coronavirus-science-analysis\">How science finally caught up with Trump's playbook \u2013 with millions of lives at stake</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>At a lengthy, rambling and combative briefing on Saturday afternoon, the president also sought to discredit media reports of his administration\u2019s failures and called some outlets in the White House press corps \u201cfake news\u201d.</p> \n<p>Media reports about shortages of ventilators and personal protective equipment, he claimed, relied on state governors asking for more supplies than they needed.</p> \n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/04/coronavirus-map-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">researchers at Johns Hopkins University</a> in Maryland, by Saturday evening more than 305,000 cases of Covid-19 had been confirmed in the US, resulting in more than 8,000 deaths.

On Saturday, Trump tried to claim credit for the 1,000 ventilators sent to New York by China and said, \u201ctwo very good friends of mine brought him those ventilators\u201d.</p> \n<p>In his morning press conference, Cuomo said New York had 113,704 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and a death toll of 3,565. Most deaths were in New York City, with nearly 1,000 in other parts of the state.</p> \n<p>Current projections put the peak of the pandemic in New York between four and 14 days away. Officials hope physical distancing will slow the spread of the disease and forestall the possibility of running out of ventilators and hospital beds.</p> \n<p>Cuomo admitted he hoped to see the apex soon, so the experience would soon end. The pandemic, \u201cstresses this country, this state, in a way nothing else has frankly in my lifetime\u201d, he said.</p> \n<p>Cuomo\u2019s briefing from the New York state capital, Albany, offered another contrast in leadership with the president in Washington. While Cuomo\u2019s briefings convey alarming statistics, his frank descriptions of shortages and personal struggles have been praised.</p> \n<p>On Saturday, Cuomo said the state had a signed contract for 17,000 ventilators, a deal he was later told could not be done because many had already been bought by China.</p> \n<p>As Cuomo spoke, Trump retweeted articles about hydroxychloroquine, from rightwing sources.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/04/andrew-cuomo-profile-coronavirus-new-york\">Unloved by progressives, New York's Andrew Cuomo has the spotlight now</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The US federal government\u2019s response to the outbreak has been defined by bungled testing, poor coordination, low stockpiles and planning failures.

That was higher than the average the state was registering earlier in the week, but exactly how many of those were older results wasn\u2019t clear.</p> <p>The number of new deaths reported Saturday was lower than on Friday \u2013 39 as opposed to 60 \u2013 but higher than Thursday\u2019s toll of 37.</p> <p>On the contrary, the number of Covid-19 patients in the hospital and on life-saving ventilator machines was higher than Friday: 1,726 and 571, respectively. Those will not alleviate the state\u2019s concerns about a looming shortage in hospital bed space and ventilators, though officials announced Saturday that Louisiana would receive an additional 200 ventilators from the national stockpile.</p> <p>Keeping bed space in New Orleans area hospitals as ample as possible is where the makeshift hospital at the convention center comes in.</p> <p>The pop up facility \u2013 which is costing more than $90 million to build, equip and staff, largely through a contractor \u2013 is meant to treat COVID-19 patients who no longer need acute treatment at a hospital but still require care they can\u2019t get at home, said Dr. Meghan Maslanka, the site\u2019s medical operations manager.</p> <p>Such patients \u2013 who need a hospital referral to be admitted \u2013 will be treated and observed in tent rooms that are about the size of backyard sheds.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T22:44:27.018Z\">at 11.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e8905828f08c35a1d11a1cb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T22:09:16.021Z\">11.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In concluding the daily briefing, Trump says we are approaching a \u201chorrendous\u201d time in the outbreak across the United States.</p> <p>\u201cWe are getting to that time where the numbers are going to peak and it is not going to be a good-looking situation,\u201d the president says. \u201cI really believe we\u2019ve probably have never seen anything like these kind of numbers.

An additional 708 people died.</p> \n<p>\u2022 It emerged that 212 patients in the Midlands have died after testing positive for coronavirus in the last 24 hours \u2013 more than London, which has been hit hardest so far, which had 127 deaths.</p> \n<p>\u2022 There were signs of a slight drop in public confidence in the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic. An Opinium poll for the <em>Observer</em> found that approval of the government\u2019s handling dropped from a net approval of +42% last week to +23% this week.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Michael Gove, the cabinet office minister, warned that there was evidence that the young were less compliant with social distancing orders, as he pleaded with the public to show \u201cself-restraint\u201d and follow the lockdown measures.</p> \n<p>\u2022 It was announced that the Queen will praise the nation for its \u201cself-discipline\u201d and \u201cresolve\u201d during the coronavirus pandemic in a rare televised address broadcast on Sunday.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The Cambridge University statistician, Sir David Speigelhalter, said the drop in the number of new cases gave grounds for optimism. \u201cI am relieved.

If that changes, it could change quickly.\u201d</p> \n<p>There was also a warning from a leading pandemic expert that failings \u201cranging from lack of preparedness to complacency\u201d meant that there was now no alternative to building immunity in the population, either through gradual infection or vaccination \u2013 which could be more than a year away.</p> \n<p>Francois Balloux, professor of computational systems biology and the director of the University College London genetics institute, said: \u201cI personally, cannot see any viable alternative to ensuring immunity builds up in the population, through infection or vaccination. What is critical is to minimise hospital overload, to ensure mortality is kept as low as possible. There was a window of opportunity earlier in the Covid-19 pandemic, where it could have been controlled. We missed it, for various reasons, ranging from lack of preparedness to complacency.

These have involved very large-scale testing and as much contact tracing as possible, to identify people with the virus. \u201cThis strategy was difficult to achieve at the beginning of the outbreak, because of logistic problems in testing at such a large scale and our lack of experience at large scale contact tracing,\u201d Hibberd added. \u201cHowever, we should now be able to overcome these problems.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mark Woolhouse at Edinburgh University highlighted three key strategies for dealing with the epidemic. \u201cOnce lockdown has driven down the virus to low enough levels in the community we can go back to chasing down individual cases. At the same time we build more ICU capacity in the NHS so we can relax the lockdown without the health service being overwhelmed. And thirdly, we place new emphasis in shielding the vulnerable.\u201d</p> \n<p>By contrast, John Edmunds, also of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, argued that the only way to proceed was to continue with the lockdown policy for many months. \u201cTesting on its own will not stop this epidemic,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want the NHS to cope then you will have to take extreme measures for a long time. There is no way out. We will have social distance for many months or hospitals will be overwhelmed.

  "<p>You can see how <em>The English Game</em> must have sounded in conception. It\u2019s the birth of football. It\u2019s toffs against proles, the rivalry of one of the great aristocrats of the early game, Lord Arthur Kinnaird, and the Glaswegian stonemason who was the first great professional, Fergus Suter. It\u2019s about an idea going out into the world and being profoundly changed when it is taken up by the masses.</p> <p>But Netflix\u2019s new series comes nowhere near what it might have been, and is little more than a mishmash of <em>Downton Abbey</em> stereotypes and trouble-at-mill cliches. The toffs are habitually awful, the banks are always foreclosing, and the proles, salt-of-the-earth brawlers and charmers that they are, can\u2019t help themselves but get everybody unhelpfully pregnant.</p> <p>And the football? From the moment a minute in when Craig Parkinson, as the self-made mill-owner Walsh, tells Suter: \u201cI\u2019ve seen \u2019ow you play in Scotland. Your passing game is the future of football,\u201d you know that subtlety, or characters who actually speak like real humans, isn\u2019t what this is about. Still, for those who last saw Parkinson as the AC-12 officer Cottan in <em>Line of Duty</em>, where the plot revolved around the quest for the kingpin H and the implausible possibility that as he took his final breath he tapped out the letter in morse code, it\u2019s something of a relief that here he eschews Hs altogether.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/20/the-english-game-review-julian-fellowes-football-drama-is-an-own-goal\">The English Game review \u2013 Julian Fellowes football drama is an own goal</a> </p> </aside>  <p><em>The English Game</em> does improve slightly after a truly dire opening episode, but the interest really lies in themes that are glimpsed almost out of the corner of the eye, shoved to the margins by the heavy-handed central narrative. Suter, for instance, is offered a huge lump sum plus improved wages to leave Darwen and join Blackburn Rovers, which he accepts because he needs the money to rescue his mother and sister from his abusive father. Quite aside from the issue of whether it\u2019s legitimate, without any evidence, to portray an actual person, albeit one who died more than a century ago, as a wife-beater, there\u2019s a more universal question. Why shouldn\u2019t Suter take the better offer? Darwen had paid to lure him from Partick and then they themselves were outbid: once professionalism has been accepted, why should there be a perceived need to give Suter an excuse for moving?</p> <p>Other than giving one of the principal characters a troubled backstory, what is gained by blurring the central dilemma of professionalism, that without adequate checks money will dominate \u2013 something all too apparent in the super-club era \u2013 and that the transformation of the game into a job, while beneficial and necessary in opening it up to all, also inevitably erodes to an extent the camaraderie and athletic purity that are so central to the notion of sport as somehow spiritually improving?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14767f932073aa83e273d2d4e39ffaadb6f0514e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14767f932073aa83e273d2d4e39ffaadb6f0514e/536_1057_5005_3003/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Edward Holcroft as Arthur Kinnaird in playing action during The English Game\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edward Holcroft as Arthur Kinnaird, later Lord Kinnaird, who played for Wanderers and Old Etonians and later became FA president.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oliver Upton/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a thought that occurs now in discussions about a putative super-league. It\u2019s easy to rail against it, to anticipate the potential tedium of the same super-clubs endlessly grappling with each other, to think of the social damage done to the non-super-clubs cast into permanent semi-irrelevance by exclusion from the main competition, to rage against the victory of capital over community, but there\u2019s always also a thought of how history will view the debate. After 10 or 20 years of a super-league, and the brilliant football it would probably yield, would those arguments come to seem as irrelevant as those that once doubted the European club competitions, or British involvement in the World Cup, or, yes, professionalism and the formation of a league?</p> <p>In <em>The English Game</em>, the toffs object to the working-class northern teams largely for reasons of status. And perhaps that\u2019s how it was: after all, even leaving overt snobbism aside, it\u2019s understandable that the university-educated teams who had codified the game not two decades earlier (in January 1864, the Football Association comprised eight south-eastern clubs plus Sheffield) would be resistant to an entirely different group of people taking over their game, particularly when they interpreted it in a very different way.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2020/mar/31/david-squires-on-the-english-premier-league-game-julian-fellowes-netflix\">David Squires on \u2026 The English Premier League Game</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The tactical exposition in <em>The English Game</em> is clunkingly preposterous, but it\u2019s not without substance: the passing game the northern teams came to favour (in part because they were smaller than their better-fed public school counterparts and so would have been seriously disadvantaged if they had no way of manoeuvring the ball away from physical clashes) was very different to the head-on charging practised by the game\u2019s progenitors.</p> <p>Although the point is not made explicitly in the series, the reason Darwen had to travel to London for their FA Cup quarter-final replay against Old Etonians in 1879 is that it was stipulated that all games from the quarter-finals onwards had to be played in London (the first match was not, as depicted in <em>The English Game</em>, played at Eton, but at Kennington Oval) \u2013 a not unreasonable requirement when most of the teams were based in the south-east. It\u2019s notable that by the following season the regulation had been lifted, suggesting at least some flexibility on the part of the FA and a recognition that the geographic make-up of the game was changing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and thebiggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>And it would go on to change, spreading across the world. The English game became the Austrian game, the Hungarian game, the Argentinian game and, particularly, the Uruguayan game. It became everybody\u2019s game, interpreted differently by every culture that embraced it. And that in turn created difficulties \u2013 as demonstrated in the tours made by British clubs to South America in the first half of the 20th century, which often became fractious with mutual misunderstanding, laying the ideological foundations for the controversy that would, for instance, overwhelm the 1966 World Cup quarter-final between England and Argentina. One of the fascinations of football is that it is simultaneously intensely local and utterly globalised, with all the tensions that brings.</p> <p>But don\u2019t expect to see any of that on Netflix, where the toffs drink claret and the proles drink beer (or whisky if they\u2019re Scottish and having a bad time), the bank is forever foreclosing and an implausible number of goals are scored in the few seconds after kick-off. It\u2019s a tremendous opportunity missed.</p>",

But he has been accused of refusing to cooperate with US authorities investigating Epstein, who in 2008 pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution.</p> <p>\u201cContrary to Prince Andrew\u2019s very public offer to cooperate with our investigation into Epstein\u2019s co-conspirators, an offer that was conveyed via press release, Prince Andrew has now completely shut the door on voluntary cooperation and our office is considering its options,\u201d Manhattan US attorney Geoffrey Berman told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/09/prince-andrew-will-not-voluntarily-cooperate-epstein-investigation-lawyer-says\">reporters </a>in March, revisiting a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/27/prince-andrew-jeffrey-epstein-us-prosecutors-fbi-seek-interview\">claim</a> made in January.</p> <p>Buckingham Palace said then it would not comment and said \u201cthe issue is being dealt with by the Duke of York\u2019s legal team\u201d.</p> <p>Sources previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/29/prince-andrew-angry-claims-not-cooperating-jeffrey-epstein-inquiry\">told</a> the Guardian Andrew was \u201ccommitted to the legal process\u201d.</p> <p>A source was quoted as saying: \u201cHe is angry about the way this is being portrayed and bewildered as to why this was said in New York.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>With all the serious issues surrounding coronavirus, it feels surreal and distasteful to be encouraged to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/03/matt-hancock-deflecting-blame-on-to-footballers-andros-townsend-crystal-palace-premier-league-pay-cuts\">focus our ire</a> on the stereotype of, so it goes, greedy, selfish, over-paid footballers.</p> <p>Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said: \u201cGiven the sacrifices that many people are making, including some of my colleagues in the NHS who have made the ultimate sacrifice... I think the first thing that Premier League footballers can do is make a contribution, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/52142267\">take a pay cut</a> and play their part.\u201d Shame on you, Mr Hancock: coronavirus should not be used as an excuse for a crass, inappropriate stand-off between footballers and tragically dead NHS workers.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say that top-flight football has been above criticism during the pandemic. Clubs such as Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United have been rightly censured for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/02/pay-cuts-furlough-or-deferrals-what-are-the-premier-league-clubs-doing\">taking advantage</a> of the government\u2019s furloughing scheme, allowing taxpayers to pick up the bill for cleaners, security, shop workers and catering staff, leading to accusations of a \u201cmoral vacuum\u201d.</p> <p>The Premier League has now asked players, via the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association, to take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/03/premier-league-clubs-will-ask-players-to-take-30-per-cent-wage-drop-cuts-deferrals\">a 30% drop in pay</a>, in terms of cuts and wage referrals, while the 20 top clubs will <a href=\"https://www.sportinglife.com/football/news/pl-in-pound125m-advance-for-efl-clubs/178891?aff=1197317997&amp;dcmp=SL_TWITTER_PREMIERLEAGUE\">donate \u00a3125m</a> to the English Football League and National League and \u00a320m to support the NHS, communities and vulnerable groups.</p> <p>I sincerely hope that even more good is done and more selflessness displayed. However, it was still unfair to frame this as footballers needing to be morally shamed into action because players don\u2019t control how wages are paid. Such framing pitted \u201cordinary\u201d people against not just football \u2013 in terms of big business \u2013 but individual players.</p> <p>And, you think: why are footballers \u2013 young, self-made sportsmen - in particular getting stick and not, say, far <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8183763/Sell-one-yachts-Outrage-billionaire-Sir-Philip-Green-asks-taxpayer-help.html\">wealthier global businessman</a>, several of whom have held their hands out for government assistance?</p> <p>To me, this reeks of deep-rooted class prejudice. Overwhelmingly, footballers tend to come from poorer backgrounds, often extremely poor in the case of overseas players. This means that, as much as the players are idolised, they also find themselves routinely attacked for being greedy, arrogant and \u201cjumped up\u201d.</p> <p>Of course Premier League players are overpaid, but people forget that, in days gone by, clubs took much of the money and footballers were lucky to end up with a pub and a drink problem when their careers were over. But an archaic resentment towards players persists and while, generally, it\u2019s lighthearted (\u201cHe\u2019s paid <em>how much</em> and he misses a penalty?\u201d), at other times, like now, it has a real danger of turning rancid.</p> <p>This is what Hancock seemed to be doing with his comment \u2013 taking an easy shot at \u201crich\u201d, \u201cspoilt\u201d footballers, perhaps to deflect attention from the government\u2019s own failings. What an insult to those brave NHS workers who made the ultimate sacrifice.</p> <h2>Modern romance was ruined long before coronavirus</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e38ecaf6816818d0a9b6c77cb66d790cbdf370c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e38ecaf6816818d0a9b6c77cb66d790cbdf370c9/0_153_4578_2747/1000..jpg\" alt=\"the tinder app logo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018For too many women, this has turned out to be the romance model that never <em>starts</em> giving.

More seriously, as tricky and awful as the situation is, don\u2019t many people find online dating difficult and unfulfilling at the best of times \u2013 if somebody wants a relationship and not just a hook-up?</p> <p>Sexual emancipation is a wonderful thing, but both parties must agree. Since the online dating boom, too often it has seemed that women in particular have been dealing with dating on uber-sexualised male terms \u2013 where sex is the main objective, and relationships have become rare and disposable.</p> <p>For too many women, this has turned out to be the romance model that never <em>starts</em> giving. Swiping left or right. Netflix and chilling. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/27/tell-us-what-are-your-experiences-of-ghosting\">Ghosting</a>...<a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/27/tell-us-what-are-your-experiences-of-ghosting\"> </a>All this is about no-strings sex and keeping options firmly open. Put bluntly, it\u2019s about facilitating commitment phobia. For some, this works well and good luck to them. For others, it leads to misery and the tedium of dealing with weaponised time-wasters.</p> <p>Has online dating played fair with people who ultimately want relationships? Obviously, there are safety issues in meeting strangers. Away from that, while casual sex has its place, I sympathise with anyone who dislikes the modern romantic-sexual landscape, but gets labelled prudish if they complain. So, sure, modern romance is tricky in the time of coronavirus, but some might argue that online love is also a nightmare.</p> <h2>So Harry can\u2019t pop over to granny\u2019s.

President Trump said he wouldn\u2019t pay for their security, which came as a shock to them, as they\u2019d never asked him to.

Though I suppose, for some, Meghan has become the ultimate Disney villain.</p> <p>Seriously, who cares? This is a wealthy couple who (hopefully) will have little trouble keeping themselves and their child safe and well. If they can\u2019t visit their extended families at the moment, so what \u2013 nobody can. Above all, get a grip. Just as it feels silly to obsess about celebrities right now \u2013 either to worship or bash them \u2013 the same applies to royals.

  "<p>If the familiar list of the most influential fashion figures is beginning to sound predictable \u2013 sorry Anna, sorry Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 meet someone who wields no less influence but is not (yet) a household name: Elizabeth von der Goltz.</p> <p>As the global buying director for <a href=\"https://www.net-a-porter.com/gb/en/\" title=\"\">Net-a-Porter</a>, the world\u2019s largest multibrand luxury retailer, von der Goltz is to fashion what a conductor is to the orchestra: everyone looks to her to see what\u2019s coming next. Her role is to scout, source and nurture brands and designers (from established to emerging, in everything from lingerie to sportswear); cut deals in order sell their designs; and to do everything she can to support the brand and its sales. That\u2019s the basic outline. In reality, her job is a task of titanic proportions.</p> <p>Von der Goltz\u2019s much-coveted position demands a nose for new talent and a finely honed instinct for trends \u2013 clothes as well as concepts \u2013 years before they materialise. And she must do that with the conviction of someone unfazed by the multi-million-pound budgets she is responsible for, and the confidence of someone who understands the cultural differences between the 170 countries that Net-a-Porter serves. </p> <p>She is fashion\u2019s formidable silent force, yet on every occasion I\u2019ve encountered her \u2013 whether navigating an army of street-style photographers fighting to get her picture in the rain, or being delayed for two hours on board a London-Milan flight and missing countless appointments \u2013 she is never anything but calm, cool and approachable, with a mega-watt smile.</p> <p>Little wonder she is a part of a wave of retail directors attracting attention. Whereas in the past these roles remained relatively under the radar outside of the fashion industry, they are now basking in widespread recognition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfff9484821802a27b2bd1c355b45b6dd7058907\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfff9484821802a27b2bd1c355b45b6dd7058907/0_154_3296_1976/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth von der Goltz with Alexa Chung\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Brands \u2013 even big designers \u2013 come to me for advice\u201d: Elizabeth von der Goltz, pictured with Alexa Chung.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt really has changed. I don\u2019t know if any of us anticipated it. I didn\u2019t,\u201d laughs von der Goltz, 46, who has nearly 25 years\u2019 experience. \u201cI think people didn\u2019t understand before. Even when I was in school, I didn\u2019t think about how fashion gets into the store. Now people are thinking: \u2018Who\u2019s behind it? Who are these people?\u2019 And it\u2019s not just fashion. People are so much more interested in what happens behind the scenes.\u201d</p> <p>Von der Goltz\u2019s recent appearance on the Netflix hit <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/29/next-in-fashion-review-alexa-chung-and-tan-frances-outrageously-ott-reality-tv\" title=\"\">Next in Fashion</a></em>, which saw 10 fledgling designers battle it out to win a $250,000 prize and sell their collections on Net-a-Porter, is one of the many ways the veil is being lifted. As a guest judge on the series finale, von der Goltz was arguably the most important person on the panel. The cash prize might sound impressive, but becoming a success on her product pages affords a designer the widespread recognition necessary to make them several times the prize money and validates everything they\u2019ve worked for. On the flipside, if a designer isn\u2019t ready, it could spell catastrophe.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a huge consideration,\u201d says von der Goltz, her chirpy American accent placing the emphasis on huge. \u201cAt Net-a-Porter we have three warehouses we ship to around the world \u2013 London, New York and Hong Kong \u2013 so even when we\u2019re buying a small buy, it\u2019s actually huge! We can make or break a brand and so we have a responsibility to help them develop and evolve, because we almost change the structure of their company just by asking them to complete our order.\u201d She compares it to a marriage: \u201cYou have to believe that they\u2019re ready to build a business, because then we\u2019re in it for a long time.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It takes instinct, taste and creativity to set the trends</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Von der Goltz has form for placing her bets wisely. By her own humble admission she has been \u201cextremely influential\u201d for years. Before taking the top job at the London-based juggernaut in 2017, von der Goltz was the designer buyer for 16 years at Fifth Avenue landmark store Bergdorf Goodman, where, she says, \u201cbrands \u2013 even big designers \u2013 would come to me for advice\u201d.</p> <p>Far from just selling fashion, she is responsible for the existence of fashion houses. The founders of <a href=\"https://monse.com/index.php/\" title=\"\">Monse</a>, who are also creative directors at Oscar de la Renta, first came to von der Goltz with sketches \u2013 now it\u2019s one of New York fashion week\u2019s highlights. She persuaded Valentino to start producing the pre-fall and cruise collections. \u201cI told them, work with me, we need this delivery. If it works, I\u2019m totally happy for you to sell it to the rest of the world,\u201d she says. \u201cNow it\u2019s huge business!\u201d</p> <p>What von der Goltz gives out in support, she gets back tenfold. Vincent Ho, co-founder of the avant-garde New York collective <a href=\"https://peterdo.net/\" title=\"\">Peter Do</a>, which started on Instagram, calls her a fairy godmother. \u201cShe works for Net-a-Porter, but she\u2019s really helpful to our brand \u2013 telling us what to look out for,\u201d Ho says. \u201cShe\u2019s always accessible \u2013 whether it\u2019s through an Instagram DM, an email, or a text, she\u2019s willing to help us at any given moment. And she\u2019s so personable,\u201d Ho says with a hint of mischief. \u201cShe responds to stories; she talks about food \u2013 she\u2019s one of us.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Von der Goltz has</strong></em> had a front row seat not just to every fashion show but at every major fashion evolution for the best part of the last two decades \u2013 and right now is no different. Her arrival at Net-a-Porter also coincided with one of the most polarising eras in fashion, with the spotlight on sustainability highlighting the unmanageable volume of clothing in the world.</p> <p>Federico Marchetti, CEO of Net-a-Porter, told <em><a href=\"https://wwd.com/\" title=\"\">Women\u2019s Wear Daily </a></em>in December that its 10 distribution centres worldwide total \u201calmost 100 soccer fields in eight countries\u201d. While a buyer plays a key role in an industry that has been heavily criticised for creating and selling too much stuff, von der Goltz is characteristically articulate and informed. \u201cThe customer doesn\u2019t need to choose between style or sustainability any longer \u2013 they can now have both,\u201d she tells me over email after our call. \u201cThe product we buy \u2013 and therefore what our customers buy \u2013 is particularly important as the production of fashion and textiles has a significant impact on the welfare of people and ecosystems.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96a3f429d5ce2878033b6bda1b9b32d3f9dde79a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96a3f429d5ce2878033b6bda1b9b32d3f9dde79a/267_444_2846_4400/647.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth von der Goltz crossing a road in New York wearing multi-coloured plaid trousers and a white T-shirt\" width=\"647\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Street style: in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Vierig/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On her watch, Net-a-Porter has launched two things she is passionate about: the Vanguard programme, which gives new designers access to the entire company, including legal, marketing and business development teams; and Net Sustain, which platforms community, craft and locally sourced products. Putting sustainability at the top of the agenda is integral to any buyer\u2019s reputation right now: \u201cOur aim is to give a voice to the brands on site, big or small, that are truly making positive changes by providing them with a platform to highlight their best practice.\u201d She points to \u201cthe advancement of data, AI and VR capabilities\u201d increasingly aiding the buyer\u2019s role in the future.</p> <p>Von der Goltz is good at adapting. Born in New York, her family were globetrotters \u2013 her father was in private equity, her mother an art gallerist. Tokyo, London and then Hong Kong called, where she grew up with her older brother and went to the German-Swiss school. An art history degree in Washington DC followed, including an internship at Christie\u2019s in London. A career in art was not for her, she discovered, but the formative years and inherited talents for business and creativity proved invaluable.</p> <p>\u201cYou really have to have two sides of the brain to be a buyer, because so much of the work is financial and analytical. We have to grow our business double digits year on year. But the other side takes a lot of instinct, taste and creativity, because you\u2019re the one setting the trends of what people are buying.\u201d Note that this is always at least six months in advance, so there\u2019s no temperature- taking from the style on the street.</p> <p>After Hong Kong, on the advice of a friend who worked at the legendary fashion boutique <a href=\"https://www.joyce.com/\" title=\"\">Joyce</a>, von der Goltz relocated to New York to pursue her love of fashion. After landing a temping position at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/22/barneys-new-york-closing-luxury-industry\" title=\"\">Barneys</a> (\u201cIt was my Mecca!\u201d) she put her head down and eventually became an assistant buyer in the \u201cprivate label\u201d area of the store, which at the time was designed by Dutch designer Ronald Van Der Kemp. It was 1997 \u2013 and the break she needed.</p> <p>\u201cIn that role, you didn\u2019t just buy, you started from complete scratch; everything from ordering the sample fabric to the finish of a garment. It was a great place to start, because I learned so much about fabrication, how much fabric it takes to make a jacket, production in Italy, all of that. I feel fabrics now and designers say, \u2018This is expensive because it comes from this mill\u2019, and I\u2019m like: \u2018I know exactly what you\u2019re talking about!\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d931e0ac4c4d74217d9200da1b1ca34edfb36382\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d931e0ac4c4d74217d9200da1b1ca34edfb36382/631_274_2573_4726/544.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth von der Goltz wearing a light blue long dress, white boots, neon green bag and blue vinyl coat, in Paris\" width=\"544\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Big mac: at Paris fashion week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claudio Lavenia/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After working her way up through Barneys, a brief spell at the now closed New York institution Henri Bendel, and her nearly two decades at Bergdorf\u2019s, von der Goltz was already an industry authority \u2013 especially when it came to what makes a good buyer.</p> <p>Being an excellent negotiator is mandatory: \u201cWe negotiate down to the core with each of our brands \u2013 it\u2019s all about margin and probability, so you have to have that leadership voice in the industry.\u201d</p> <p>You also need to have a great world view. \u201cI love people with a liberal arts background who read fiction, watch movies, travel, love art and architecture, because so much of what we\u2019re doing is influenced by the culture around us. The customer is global, so you have to understand who she is, what\u2019s she doing every day; when she\u2019s travelling; what she\u2019s seeing, what her hobbies are.\u201d</p> <p>When in London, where she is based full-time now with her husband Andreas, she practises what she preaches. In between managing a team of 50, relentless schedules of back-to-back meetings and round-the-world attendances at London, Milan, Paris, Shanghai, Copenhagen, Seoul, Sydney and Tbilisi fashion weeks, she keeps her finger on the pulse.</p> <p><em><strong>As for what</strong></em> the woman who presents women with what to wear wears, von der Goltz looks forward to getting dressed every day and brushes off any suggestion of pressure \u2013 even if she is becoming one of fashion\u2019s most photographed people. \u201cI innately love fashion!\u201d she enthuses. \u201cI love clothes \u2013 even when I\u2019m doing Pilates or I\u2019m in the mountains, I have an idea of how I want to look in my head.\u201d Favourites include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/feb/12/gabriela-hearst-war-on-waste-upends-the-fashion-process\" title=\"\">Gabrie</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/feb/12/gabriela-hearst-war-on-waste-upends-the-fashion-process\" title=\"\">la Hearst</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2011/nov/15/joseph-altuzarra\" title=\"\">Altuzarra</a>, <a href=\"https://www.net-a-porter.com/gb/en/Shop/Designers/Citizens_of_Humanity?cm_mmc=GoogleUK--c-_-NAP_EN_UK_London-_-NAP+-+INTL+-+London+-+Designer_Citizens+of+Humanity+-+BT--Citizens+of+Humanity+-+Alone+-+Exact-_-citizens%20of%20humanity_e_kwd-147101016_INTL&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw3-bzBRBhEiwAgnnLCr31kmHdvqvC1foBPvLtjSiaSZpdYuHsFVSVuwudvKyUrv3R46YfehoCLTAQAvD_BwE&amp;pn=1&amp;npp=60&amp;image_view=product&amp;dScroll=0\" title=\"\">Citizens of Humanity</a> and, of course, Peter Do, which give her what she calls a mix of high and low. She adds: \u201cComfort and confidence are always most important.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps another reason why von der Goltz has enjoyed such a long and successful career is that she\u2019s not afraid to say the things that, 10 years ago, would have been considered sacrilege in the fashion buyer\u2019s rulebook. First up: money doesn\u2019t necessarily buy you style. \u201cThere is not a defined way of saying someone has style or not \u2013 if you have the money, you have access, but there are so many people out there with the most amazing style wearing clothes from the high street.\u201d Second, there are no rules. \u201cThe world has changed so much that\u2019s it\u2019s not about trends dictating any more, so you can express yourself,\u201d she says. But maybe look for her cue, too.</p>",
  "<p>More people are staying indoors to avoid contact with people potentially infected by Covid-19. But in light of a recent <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e3.htm?s_cid=mm6912e3_w\">report</a> from the US\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that said RNA from the virus that causes Covid-19 was found in the Diamond Princess ship 17 days after its passengers had left, what are the risks of handling packages, groceries and what scientists call \u201chigh-touch\u201d surfaces?</p> \n<h2><strong>Does the cruise ship report imply that viruses survive up to 17 days on surfaces?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Dr Julia Marcus: </strong>A CDC investigation of the cruise ship found evidence of viral RNA in cabins that hadn\u2019t yet been cleaned. But to be clear, that just means the virus was detectable \u2013 not that it was viable or that contact with those services would have been able to infect someone. <em>(Editor\u2019s note: RNA, or ribonucleic acid, carries the virus\u2019s genetic information.)</em></p> \n<p><strong>Dr Akiko Iwasaki: </strong>It just means that there are parts of the virus that still remain. The virus needs many other components to be intact. If you have bits and pieces of RNA, that\u2019s not going to make a virus, you need an entire intact genome. Just because you had a little piece of RNA doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s an infection.</p> \n<h2><strong>How long can the virus survive on surfaces?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Marcus: </strong>The New England Journal of Medicine just <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2004973?query=featured_home\">published a study</a> that tested how long the virus can remain stable on different kinds of surfaces within a controlled laboratory setting. They found that it was still detectable on copper for up to four hours, on cardboard for up to 24 hours, and on plastic and steel for up to 72 hours.</p> \n<p>But it\u2019s important to note that the amount of virus decreased rapidly over time on each of those surfaces. And so the risk of infection from touching them would probably decrease over time as well.</p> \n<h2><strong>Could you become infected from just a single particle of coronavirus?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Iwasaki: </strong>There\u2019s a certain amount of viral particle that you need to be exposed to become infected. If you just had one viral particle on your finger, it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019re going to be infected. Some viruses are very potent, you only need like 10 particles to get infected, while others you [may] need millions. The fewer viral particles you\u2019re exposed to, the less likely you\u2019re going to get infected. That\u2019s why the amount of virus on a surface is important.</p> \n<h2><strong>How many people are being contaminated via surfaces as opposed to airborne particles or direct contact with an infected person?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Marcus: </strong>As far as we know right now, people are much more likely to be infected by close contact with an infected person than by touching a contaminated surface. That said, it\u2019s still important to be conscious of what we\u2019re touching, especially high-touch surfaces, and be careful about cleaning our hands after touching things. For example, public transit or grocery stores and places where there tend to be a lot of people.</p> \n<p><strong>Iwasaki: </strong>The virus is pretty stable on [materials] like plastic and steel \u2013 they can persist for a few days. So it\u2019s very possible that someone who\u2019s sick will deposit the virus on to the surface and then somebody else will touch it and touch their face.</p> \n<h2><strong>Is there a risk of being infected by groceries and packages that we have delivered?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Marcus: </strong>It\u2019s a low risk, but it\u2019s possible that if someone is delivering a package to your house and they are sick, that may be a route for transmission. I would recommend that any time something new comes into your household, be conscious of washing your hands after handling it.</p> \n<p><strong>Iwasaki: </strong>The [virus\u2019s] stability is pretty good on the cardboard. Once you get those packages, open them, quickly throw away the cardboard, wash your hands, and try to avoid touching your face. Take any measures that you can to minimize contact from the surface of the package to your face.</p> \n<h2><strong>Is it possible the contents of a package could have been contaminated by whoever packed it?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Iwasaki: </strong>There\u2019s definitely a possibility of contamination, but it\u2019s much more likely that the outer cardboard itself will come into contact with a lot more people than what\u2019s inside. And if it takes days to get to your home, whatever virus that was inside will be deactivated already.</p> \n<h2><strong>Do you have any tips for cleaning surfaces?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Marcus: </strong>It\u2019s good to routinely clean any high-touch surfaces, like door handles and toilets. Regular household cleaners are effective, including bleach solutions and alcohol solutions of at least 70% alcohol. If somebody in your household has been diagnosed with Covid-19, then cleaning and disinfection becomes much more important and should be done more frequently.</p> \n<p><strong>Iwasaki: </strong>The [Food and Drug Administration] has a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/cleaning-disinfection.html\">list of home cleaning products</a> that are known to kill Covid-19. This virus is an <a href=\"https://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/covid-19/select-effective-disinfectants-use-against-coronavirus-causes-covid-19\">enveloped virus</a> so it doesn\u2019t survive well in soap and alcohol.</p> \n<p><strong>Experts:</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Dr Akiko Iwasaki, professor of immunology at Yale University</p></li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Dr Julia Marcus, infectious disease epidemiologist and professor in the Department of Population Medicine at Harvard Medical School</p><p><em>Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.

  "<p>If you have been slapping down terrifying news stories like you\u2019re playing a frantic game of Whack-a-Mole, then you might have found solace in the engrossing Netflix documentary <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/20/tiger-king-joe-exotic-netflix-series\">Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness</a></em>.</p> <p>The series has been such a success that it inspired my mother to send me a meme for the first time, one featuring its star, Joe Exotic. Little wonder that a documentary about a gay, gun-toting, polyamorous, imprisoned tiger breeder with a sideline in country music and running for political office has captured our attention. An audience on lockdown, with no access to their usual entertainment, without sport, without live music, festivals cancelled, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/20/tiger-king-joe-exotic-netflix-series\">Wimbledon</a> cancelled, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/01/edinburghs-five-festivals-cancelled-due-to-coronavirus\">Edinburgh fringe</a> cancelled, at a time when watching the evening news requires a run-up of Greg Rutherford proportions, has gobbled it up. I can\u2019t think why.</p> <p>The rivalry between Joe Exotic, the private zookeeper of the title, and Carole Baskin, who runs a big cat rescue sanctuary, is so extravagant and multifaceted that even though the directors have called it \u201cShakespearean\u201d, you get the impression Shakespeare would have thought, nah, I\u2019ll leave it thanks. Every episode piles on the intrigue with such disregard for any sense of proportion that it is hard to watch without one\u2019s jaw lolling open.</p> <p>Whether it is a true and honest representation of the story is about as clear as your conscience if you\u2019ve ever paid to pose with a tiger cub. Baskin has called the series \u201csalacious and sensational\u201d, which, given that it airs a theory that she fed her ex-husband to her rescue tigers, seems like a reasonable complaint. Rebecca Chaiklin, who co-directed the series, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2020-03-26/joe-exotic-tiger-king-netflix-burning-questions\">has responded</a>, saying they were \u201ccompletely forthright with the characters. With any project that goes on for five years, things evolve and change and we followed it as any good storyteller does.\u201d This post-release saga was surely inevitable, given how litigious the participants in the series are <em>in the series</em> and could prove to be almost as gripping as the show.</p> <p>It has been bleak to realise that some viewers are treating Exotic as a hero; I dread to think how he would perform if he were allowed to run for office again. But the utter madness of <em>Tiger King</em> has been a distraction for when distraction has been needed and everyone has to to switch off, if just for a moment.</p> <h2>Greta Gerwig, keeping actors hydrated at all times</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89599a7a457840a9dbdc34e1031438f1a5d6d42b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89599a7a457840a9dbdc34e1031438f1a5d6d42b/992_302_1936_1161/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Greta Gerwig, writer and director of Little Women.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greta Gerwig, writer and director of Little Women.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marion Curtis/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Remember when a news day could be dominated by the story of a disposable coffee container appearing in the background of a blockbuster fantasy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/10/game-of-thrones-star-denies-responsibility-for-coffee-cup-blunder\">TV show</a> set in medieval-ish times, when mead was supposed to be glugged from pewter cups, rather than macchiatos sipped out of paper ones?</p> <p><em>Game of Thrones</em> should be grateful to Greta Gerwig for proving that making a gaffe like that is easier than you would think.

  "<p>The controversial practice of setting heather-covered moorland on fire \u2013 often carried out by gamekeepers to create more attractive habitats for grouse \u2013 is now banned on more than 30 major tracts of land in northern England. Three large landowners have confirmed that their tenants are no longer allowed to burn heather routinely.</p> <p>The ban is a blow to grouse shoots, which burn older heather to make way for younger, more nutritious plants for grouse to feed on, but environmental groups say the practice harms the environment. <a href=\"https://water.leeds.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/36/2017/06/EMBER_full-report.pdf\">Research by the University of Leeds</a> has found that burning grouse moors degrades peatland habitat, releases climate-altering gases, reduces biodiversity and increases flood risk.</p> <p>Last year, the <em>Observer </em>reported that Yorkshire Water was<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/22/grouse-shooting-yorkshire-water\"> reviewing each of its grouse-shooting leases</a> amid concerns about the practice of routine burning. The company says has written into its lease a presumption against burning as a land management technique.</p> <p>United Utilities is also altering its leases to shorter terms, with a similar review to Yorkshire Water\u2019s expected. Last month, it confirmed to the campaign group Ban Bloodsports on Yorkshire\u2019s Moors (BBYM) that it now prohibits routine burning on its land.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Yorkshire Water, United Utilities and the National Trust are to be commended for ending routine burning of moorland</p> <footer> <cite>Luke Steele, campaigner</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And three estates overseen by the National Trust \u2013 Marsden, Braithwaite Hall and Dark Peak \u2013 also told the group that tenants were no longer allowed to conduct routine burning. Braithwaite Hall said tenants required written consent to do so, and that it had taken legal action against one. Dark Peak said it retained complete control of burning practices on its land. Marsden said tenants could not carry out any burning.</p> <p>A National Trust spokeswoman said: \u201cWe don\u2019t allow burning on deep peat and over recent years have moved away from using controlled grouse-moor burning as a matter of course. There are a diminishing number of historic agreements where burning may occasionally be used but we are working with these tenants to introduce more sustainable land-management practice.\u201d</p> <p>Routine burning is now no longer allowed on 34 sections of moorland spanning Yorkshire, Lancashire and Derbyshire, according to BBYM. \u201cYorkshire Water, United Utilities and the National Trust are to be commended for ending routine burning of moorland,\u201d said Luke Steele of BBYM.</p> <p>Steele said there had been 550 incidents of grouse-moor burning recorded across Yorkshire since the burning season began in October. </p> <p>The environment minister, Zac Goldsmith, has promised to stop the practice. And the committee on climate change has recommended that a grouse-moor burning ban be introduced within the year. But owners of large grouse moors have threatened legal action if such a ban is introduced.</p> <p>The issue has been thrown into sharp relief by the coronavirus outbreak. Yorkshire Water and United Utilities have said that all burning on their land must now cease until further notice.

  "<p>Scholarships have been threatened. LinkedIn and Facebook profiles have been removed. Death threats have been sent in their hundreds, if not thousands. And governments spurred into action. Since mid-March \u2013 when the government first recommended self-isolation measures as a way to tackle the spread of the world-altering respiratory disease Covid-19 \u2013 a public shaming frenzy has spread across social media. Thousands of people are blaming, naming, and shaming others for their improper pandemic practices; those targeted include <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/19/coronavirus-spring-break-party/\">drunk spring breakers</a>, coughing commuters, flower markets, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/17/pop-stars-criticise-fans-over-coronavirus-inaction-billie-eilish-taylor-swift-ariana-grande-camila-cabello\">Stereophonics fans</a>, and romcom screenwriter Richard Curtis\u2019s daughter.</p> \n<p>When it comes to the crime of not taking a global pandemic seriously, perhaps online shaming is the perfect punishment. After all, if you go to a packed public place or hoard paracetamol, you\u2019re endangering other people\u2019s lives. Yet is pointing the finger actually a productive way to change others\u2019 behaviour? Are we simply spreading discord at an already distressing time? At worst, are we blaming individuals for the inconsistent and confused measures implemented by the government?</p> \n<p>The term \u201c<a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Covidiot\">covidiot</a>\u201d was first uploaded to the online slang decoder Urban Dictionary on 16 March and was defined as: \u201cSomeone who ignores the warnings regarding public health or safety.\u201d On Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/covidiot\">#covidiot</a> skyrocketed on the evening of 22 March; overnight, <a href=\"https://keyhole.co/hashtag-tracking/dashboard/3LmEQ9/covidiot?realtimePreview=true\">nearly 3,000 tweets</a> used it to call out poor practices. That same day, Hilda \u2013 a 49-year-old who runs the Facebook and Twitter accounts for Columbia Road flower market in east London \u2013 received an influx of notifications.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The worst was someone saying, \u2018I hope you and your family stay healthy and alive but sadly I doubt all of them will\u2019</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m still feeling slightly traumatised by it,\u201d says Hilda, whose name has been changed on her request, after a BBC journalist tweeted a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dinosofos/status/1241697657690734593\">picture of the market</a>, which appeared heavily crowded despite social distancing rules. The picture was \u201cliked\u201d nearly 4,000 times, with commenters bemoaning the \u201cstupidity\u201d of those in attendance. Hilda began to receive angry comments, tweets, emails, and phone calls complaining that the market should be shut down. To make matters worse, the social media accounts she runs are for market shopkeepers, and she had no control over whether the market as a whole opened (that decision lay with the local council).</p> \n<p>\u201cThe worst thing I had to open and read was someone saying, \u2018I hope you and your family stay healthy and alive but sadly I doubt all of them will,\u2019\u201d Hilda says. \u201cThey were very vitriolic \u2026 The world feels really dark and horrible.\u201d A day later, after newspapers splashed pictures from Columbia Road and other markets, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, branded those who visited crowded places \u201cvery selfish\u201d \u2013 that evening, new lockdown measures were put in place by the government. Yet Hilda argues that, at the time, people hadn\u2019t broken any rules. \u201cThe government advice was if you\u2019re healthy, go outside and exercise\u2026 that\u2019s what people were doing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hilda is far from the only person to be \u201cpandemic-shamed\u201d. On 16 March, activist Scarlett Curtis uploaded an Instagram video of herself washing her hands for nearly 30 seconds, and commenters complained she used an improper technique. \u201cPlease can we not shame anyone during this hard time,\u201d she countered. \u201cNow is the time for community not judgment.\u201d</p> \n<p>Perhaps the most egregious shaming came on 18 March, when CBS News tweeted a video of American spring breakers partying in Miami. In the video, drunk students flagrantly disregard social distancing recommendations, one declaring: \u201cIf I get corona, I get corona.\u201d The video was subtitled with the full names of every student interviewed.</p> \n<p>The clip was \u201cliked\u201d more than 96,000 times and was flooded with comments berating the students\u2019 appearances and intelligence. People began tweeting the students\u2019 names and linking to their social media profiles, writing: \u201cI have a feeling the following people will have a hard time finding a job upon graduation\u201d (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/kate_m_mcg/status/1240465770569662465\">288 likes</a>) and \u201cHospitals take note of these names. Do not give these selfish dumbfucks beds and/or respirators\u201d (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/aldentanaka/status/1240410951045623808\">84 likes</a>). Some went further and contacted the students\u2019 schools, with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macndemocracy/status/1240477462779195392\">one tweeter</a> asking for a student\u2019s scholarship to be rescinded (the same student later deleted their Facebook page).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"65a9450f-4bec-4555-bdb0-c829a2782b42\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What do the restrictions involve?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible</li>\n     <li>One form of exercise a day \u2013 for example a run, walk, or cycle \u2013 alone or with members of your household</li>\n     <li>Any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person</li>\n     <li>Travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.

And just three days earlier, internet shaming arguably had a productive outcome. After a Tennessee man received a barrage of angry comments for stockpiling 17,700 bottles of hand sanitiser to sell for inflated prices, he expressed remorse and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/technology/matt-colvin-hand-sanitizer-donation.html\">donated his stock to a local church.</a></p> \n<p>Shaming has also been used effectively to improve employees\u2019 lives during the pandemic: after Waterstones\u2019 chief executive, James Daunt, announced its stores would be staying open, an online backlash prompted him to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/waterstones-staff-say-their-health-is-at-risk-as-stores-stay-open\">reverse the decision</a> within a day. The same happened to Sports Direct, while Wetherspoon\u2019s was shamed online and off (with branches graffitied) after its chairman, Tim Martin, claimed that he couldn\u2019t afford to pay staff. A tweet calling Martin a \u201ctwat\u201d gained more than 30,000 likes, and the pay decision was reversed after he met with hospitality experts.</p> \n<p>Yet pandemic shaming can also have dire consequences. On 18 March, the Polish press reported that a professor infected with coronavirus, Wojciech Rokita, died after being flooded with hateful <a href=\"https://kielce.wyborcza.pl/kielce/7,47262,25805201,kolejny-raz-zszedl-ze-sceny-niepokonany.html?disableRedirects=true\">online comments</a>. Rumours had spread \u2013 both online and in local media \u2013 that 54-year-old Rokita had not complied with his quarantine and had <a href=\"https://www.polsatnews.pl/wiadomosc/2020-03-18/nie-zyje-lekarz-zakazony-koronawirusem-mial-mierzyc-sie-z-nieprawdopodobnym-hejtem/\">visited a car showroom</a> after being diagnosed with coronavirus. On 19 March, a lawyer representing Rokita\u2019s family claimed the professor had not violated his quarantine, and had taken his own life as a result of the \u201cwave of hate\u201d he faced online.</p> \n<p>The story of the remorseful Tennessee hoarder is also less uplifting on second glance. The <em>New York Times</em> reported that the man received hate mail and death threats, with one stranger banging on his door late at night. \u201cYour behaviour is probably going to end up with someone killing you and your wife and your children,\u201d read one email. The man has also lost his livelihood \u2013 he is now banned from selling on eBay and Amazon, previously his sole form of income.</p> \n<p>It is hardly surprising that online shaming can have tragic consequences, but when it comes to coronavirus, you could argue that shamers endanger one person in order to save many more. Yet do the shamed actually change their minds as a result of hateful comments? Is shaming actually productive?</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat they were saying was absolutely outrageous,\u201d says Laura, a 17-year-old who received online hate after attending a Stereophonics gig in Manchester on 13 March (her name has been changed on her request). Laura emphasises that when she attended the concert, mass gatherings hadn\u2019t been banned by the government (although some artists had cancelled their gigs). \u201cI had people telling me I was going to kill people, someone private messaged me saying, \u2018I hope you feel great about yourself when you\u2019re the one who\u2019s killed your whole family,\u2019\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t change my mind, they didn\u2019t make me regret that I went,\u201d Laura goes on. She received the comments on a tweet she posted after the gig, and therefore notes: \u201cWhat they were saying was irrelevant because what had happened had already been and gone, so they couldn\u2019t have stopped me from going.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6397723a-89fe-4de7-80bc-982c5aa7f79f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JbvWniXcNhA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Three days earlier, 24-year-old Jardin May from Texas received a flood of comments after tweeting, \u201cCoronavirus is everywhere. BOOK THAT FLIGHT. Take that trip. You probably won\u2019t die from it, but even if you do \u2026 You wanna die with the Eiffel Tower in the background \u2026\u201d</p> \n<p>May says some commenters educated her about coronavirus \u2013 those who were calm and polite taught her that she shouldn\u2019t be concerned about herself, but rather the elderly and vulnerable people she might infect. \u201cA lot of the stuff I know about coronavirus I didn\u2019t learn till the calmer people in the comments were like, \u2018Hey, just be careful\u2019,\u201d May says. \u201cBut Twitter took it and ran with it.\u201d</p> \n<p>A fortnight later, May is still receiving notifications from the tweet, and she is continually being branded \u201cfucking stupid and selfish\u201d, a \u201cbitch\u201d, \u201cmurderer\u201d, and a \u201cmoron\u201d. \u201cThey were extremely aggressive, they were like, \u2018Oh I hope your family dies\u2019; \u2018I hope you get sick and you die from it,\u2019\u201d May says of the initial messages she received. \u201cI did feel like a lot of people were wasting their breath, because if you\u2019re doing angry tweeting and cursing and threats, I\u2019m not gonna read it.\u201d</p> \n<p>The venom generated hasn\u2019t prevented the state from adopting online shaming during the coronavirus crisis. While individuals use it to police behaviour, now the actual police are using it to denounce members of the public. On 27 March, Derbyshire police released drone footage which labelled anonymous dog walkers and exercisers on the Peaks as indulging in outlawed \u201cnot essential\u201d travel. The former justice secretary, David Gauke, described the shaming as \u201cbadly misjudged\u201d.</p> \n<p>And last Sunday (29 March) after tweeting a photo of his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/29/stephen-kinnock-targeted-by-police-for-visiting-father-neil\">physically distanced birthday visit</a> to his father Neil, Labour MP Stephen Kinnock was criticised by the South Wales police Twitter account \u2013 \u201cA lovely thing to do, however this is not essential travel.\u201d When Kinnock replied pointing out he had been delivering \u201cnecessary supplies\u201d, the force thanked him for the \u201cclarification\u201d. The Twittersphere was divided over whether this was a good use of police time.</p> \n<p>Dr June Tangney, a psychology professor at George Mason University, and author of <em><a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-00509-000\">Shame and Guilt</a></em>, doubts shaming will prevent poor pandemic behaviour. \u201cBy shaming people, we\u2019re actually encouraging the opposite,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen people feel shamed, they tend to get very defensive, they tend to blame other people, they\u2019re disinclined to take responsibility, and they\u2019re not any more likely to change their behaviour.\u201d</p> \n<p>So why are we really shaming others during a pandemic? Dr Lydia Woodyatt is a social sciences professor at Flinders University whose research has shown that schadenfreude motivates online shaming. \u201cThe same things that drive hostility and collective action offline can drive shaming behaviour online: anger, identification with others in the cause, schadenfreude, belief that our actions together will make a difference,\u201d she explains. She points to recent research by PhD students at her university which found that when an online leader emphasises the nobility of the \u201cgoal\u201d of their shaming, people are more likely to shame.</p> \n<p>You\u2019d struggle to find a more noble goal than saving lives, so it makes sense that there\u2019s been an increase in shaming in recent weeks. Yet Woodyatt also points to a simpler explanation \u2013 with social isolation increasingly common, more and more people are online for longer stretches of time, and this is an issue that encompasses the entire world. \u201cThe sense of loss of control can mean that people try and take control of what they feel they can control,\u201d she adds.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Shame is one of our most primitive feelings ... if it happens on a grand scale it can be psychologically traumatic</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Dr Aaron Balick</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Schadenfreude and a bit of boredom might explain the reaction to a tweet posted by nightclub owner Fraser Carruthers on 16 March. Responding to Boris Johnson\u2019s recommendation that the public stop visiting pubs, Carruthers tweeted: \u201cI am a nightclub owner in Kensington and Chelsea. You can\u2019t tell the nation to avoid \u2018pubs and clubs\u2019 and not officially \u2018close us\u2019 so that we can claim our insurance.\u201d When online sleuths discovered that he had previously tweeted \u201cAnyone but Corbyn\u201d, they mocked the 37-year-old as deserving of his fate.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was a mind-blowing response,\u201d says Carruthers, who says he had \u201chundreds and hundreds\u201d of messages for \u201cthree days non-stop\u201d. He was particularly alarmed by commenters who wished he and his family would end up on the street. \u201cIt really makes you think there are some horrible people in this world.\u201d Carruthers believes the response was so strong because of the \u201cstigma\u201d of Kensington and Chelsea, but notes he didn\u2019t actually vote Conservative in the 2019 election \u2013 he voted for the Animal Welfare party.</p> \n<p>Of course, in the middle of a global pandemic, nightclub owners aren\u2019t the people we should feel sorriest for. Yet the vitriol Carruthers received demonstrates that online shaming isn\u2019t always altruistic. <a href=\"https://www.freud.org.uk/2013/10/23/psychodynamics-social-networking/\">Dr Aaron Balick</a>, a psychotherapist from London and author of <em>The Psychodynamics of Social Networking</em>, argues that online shamers are \u201chardly doing it for the safety of society. They\u2019re doing it because they get to be right and someone else gets to be wrong.\u201d</p> \n<p>Balick says pandemic shaming may be caused by fear, as \u201cpeople tend to regress when they\u2019re frightened\u201d. Yet like Tangney, he believes shaming is counterproductive and potentially dangerous. \u201cShame is one of our most primitive feelings. It does hurt, very, very deeply, and if it happens on a grand scale, like on Twitter, it can be psychologically traumatic,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>Arguably, the repercussions of online shaming aren\u2019t as severe as they were five years ago, when journalist Jon Ronson wrote his book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/15/publicly-shamed-jon-ronson-is-shame-necessary-jennifer-jacquet-review-think-before-you-tweet\">So You\u2019ve Been Publicly Shamed</a>,</em> chronicling the trauma, job losses, and damaged lives of the internet-shamed. Nowadays, trending topics move so quickly that it is difficult for one individual to capture the entire internet\u2019s attention for long. Even actor Vanessa Hudgens, who employed her best vocal fry to say, \u201cLike yeah, people are going to die, which is terrible \u2026 but inevitable?\u201d on Instagram on 16 March, got away relatively unscathed. Though Hudgens was flooded with hate and forced to issue an apology, model <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen/status/1240123787993133058\">Chrissy Teigen came to her defence</a> and gained 75,000 likes for tweeting that when people make misjudged comments, \u201cu don\u2019t have [to] ruin their lives\u201d.</p> \n<p>And indeed, if we now know the consequences of online shaming, we should also know the consequences of what we post online. May, the tweeter who encouraged people to book cheap flights, says she doesn\u2019t think the backlash was unfair because she was aware that \u201cthis is the internet\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s open for everyone to leave their opinion\u201d.</p> \n<p>It is also possible that while shaming doesn\u2019t change the behaviour of the shamed, it can adjust cultural norms. An anonymous 27-year-old says that seeing others hectored online changed his own habits. \u201cIn general it just made me take it way more seriously,\u201d he says, explaining that he had initially still planned to go on holiday and had a \u201ccavalier\u201d attitude to the dangers. \u201cOnline hectoring [of others] did force me to see that behaviour as selfish and individualistic \u2026 perhaps more than straight up relaying that information in a calm and dispassionate way would have done.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yet overall, the experts do not believe in the power of public shame. \u201cBy increasing hostility in an otherwise volatile environment we are just promoting the norm of hostility and aggression as a means of coping,\u201d Woodyatt says. \u201cI think we should all agree that is not a good idea. Humans can communicate social norms in calm and non-aggressive ways. We are all in this together.\u201d </p> \n<p>Jon Ronson, too, is not a fan of pandemic shaming (though he notes that we can and should criticise public figures who are putting people in danger). \u201cAs we\u2019re forced to isolate,\u201d he says, \u201cwe need to be able to connect with other people. It can make the difference between being happy and stoical and being depressed. The very best thing Twitter could be right now is a nice place for people to visit and find connection.\u201d</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 and the domestic violence helpline is 0808 2000 247.

  "<p>Ministers must recruit an army of \u201ccontact tracing\u201d volunteers to warn people who mayhave been infected by a Covid-19 sufferer, say public health experts.</p> <p>More than 50 leading scientists say health secretary Matt Hancock\u2019s plans to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/matt-hancock-sets-target-of-100000-coronavirus-tests-a-day\"> introduce 100,000 tests a day</a> by the end of April will only solve part of the problem of establishing how far the virus has spread.</p> <p>The scientists have come together to form the UK Covid-19 Group of Experts, and say contact tracing \u2013 identifying then alerting people who have been within infection range of a person confirmed to have the virus \u2013 will be a vital addition to testing when the lockdown begins to ease.</p> <p>Professor Allyson Pollock, a consultant in public health and director of the Newcastle University Centre for Excellence in Regulatory Science, said: \u201cThe government needs to recognise that this isn\u2019t just one big epidemic.

Schools stayed open for another eight days and it was 11 days before Boris Johnson announced the lockdown, on 23 March.</p> <p>In the face of growing criticism over the lack of testing for frontline health professionals and those with mild symptoms, Hancock announced a \u201cfive-pillar\u201d plan last Thursday. He pledged to increase lab testing dramatically, introduce new antibody tests for people who may have had the virus, and conduct \u201csurveillance testing\u201d \u2013 checking samples of the population to model the extent of the virus\u2019s spread.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve lost nearly two months in getting on top of this epidemic,\u201d Pollock said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what the scandal is really.\u201d She said there would be a second wave of infections, and planning needed to start now.</p> <p>\u201cClearly we don\u2019t have the capacity to do contact tracing, but we can just call for volunteers, train them up to do it and combine that with mobile phone apps as in Singapore and South Korea and China.\u201d</p> <p>Contact tracing was used in Wuhan, where 1,800 teams of five people went house to house, and Ireland last week said it would recruit 1,400 contact tracers. <a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/transcripts/who-audio-emergencies-coronavirus-press-conference-full-27mar2020.pdf?sfvrsn=4b72eab2_2\">On 27 March</a> the World Health Organisation director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, reiterated the need for \u201cearly detection and isolation of confirmed cases [and the] identification, follow-up and quarantine of contacts\u201d.</p> <p>Some UK public health professionals, however, believe it is too late for contact tracing because the virus has spread too far. And the example set by Singapore appears increasingly questionable: the country is to close most workplaces and all schools this week following the prime minister\u2019s admission that \u201cdespite our good contact tracing\u201d the authorities have been unable to ascertain the origin of nearly half its new cases.</p> <p>One senior director of public health, responsible for local health teams including contact tracing, dismissed the experts group as \u201carmchair commentators\u201d. \u201cContact tracing would be a waste of time right now,\u201d said the director, who asked not to be named. \u201cWe should have done better on testing, but that\u2019s being resolved. Contact tracing would tell you nothing because it\u2019s so widespread. We have to focus on increasing testing, and most virologists I\u2019ve spoken to would agree.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"43d297ec6552704588c8440ac296f63065b2cdbd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43d297ec6552704588c8440ac296f63065b2cdbd/0_0_4992_3328/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Professor Allyson Pollock\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Professor Allyson Pollock: \u2018We\u2019ve lost nearly two months in getting on top of this epidemic and that\u2019s what the scandal is really.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI suspect there will come a time for contract tracing again, but not now. It\u2019s when you start getting outbreaks in care homes and prisons and hospitals, or possibly when we\u2019re through the first or second peak and the numbers are bumping along the bottom.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the calls for contact tracing to resume appear to be gathering steam. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has repeatedly called for testing and contact tracing.At the beginnng of last week, Pollock and three others <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m1284\">published a paper </a>in the British Medical Journal questioning why the government was not following WHO advice. Then last Wednesday, 24 public health experts, led by David McCoy, professor of global public health at Barts Medical School, signed an open letter urging the government \u201cto expand community testing and individual case detection, contact tracing and appropriate isolation as a core disease control measure\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTesting and quarantine are not enough on their own,\u201d McCoy said, \u201cespecially if we want to avoid some of the serious harms that would be caused by prolonged lockdown. It is not clear why the government is resisting the evidence from elsewhere, as well as the views of the majority of public health opinion.\u201d</p> <p>The group has since expanded to include more than 50 public health experts, Pollock said.</p> <p>AnneliesWilder-Smith, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: \u201cTo anyone who tells me that contact tracing is too expensive or not do-able, I just say, rubbish. We are now basically quarantining 68 million people. That is so much more expensive. But at the moment, we cannot do contract tracing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76d32753395dca930f395b55bc2fcafc254001e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76d32753395dca930f395b55bc2fcafc254001e6/0_0_3610_2407/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A woman in singapore looks at a smartphone with the contact-tracing app on it.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Singapore government introduced a smartphone app to trace people who had come into contact with a Covid-19 sufferer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Catherine Lai/AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She said with the epidemic \u201cout of hand\u201d, the lockdown needs time to interrupt the virus\u2019s transmission.</p> <p>\u201cThen we can go back to the basics of dealing with this outbreak. You test, test, test, test. You find a case, you isolate the case; you find their contacts and you isolate their contacts.\u201d</p> <p>The Department for Health and Social Care did not respond to requests for comment, but some academics believe smartphone apps might provide automatic contact tracing.</p> <p>NHSX, a division of the NHS responsible for digital innovation, is working on an app that would monitor other phones\u2019 Bluetooth signals, keeping a record of those most at risk \u2013 possibly anyone who stayed within two metres for 15 minutes, the <em>FT </em>reported. If a user tested positive, they could upload a notification, which would warn people they needed to self-isolate.</p> <p>Yet the tracking technology would raise privacy concerns, and the system would not work efficiently unless tens of millions of people downloaded the app.</p> <p>\u201cMobile technology may be a useful adjunct, but contact tracing and the behaviour change we subsequently want to engender needs an active human element,\u201d McCoy said.</p>",

  "<p>The most glamorous and madcap of all literary honeymoons began this weekend 100 years ago as newlyweds Zelda and F Scott Fitzgerald, future stars of the Jazz Age, prepared to check into the Biltmore Hotel in New York, shortly before cartwheeling through the lobby.</p> <p>To mark the moment, and to celebrate the publication that same month of Fitzgerald\u2019s first novel, <em>This Side of Paradise</em>, fans of the great American writer across the world have joined together for online events, including a mass reading of the text.</p> <p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t just a book when it came out \u2013 it was a cultural event,\u201d said Dr Kirk Curnutt, director of the <a href=\"https://fscottfitzgeraldsociety.org/\">F Scott Fitzgerald Society</a>. \u201cWe have had to get creative [because of Covid-19 restrictions] and so we set up a Facebook reading.\u201d</p> <p>The infamous marriage, solemnised at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in New York, did not run smoothly, but it did kick off in style.</p> <p>After enjoying midnight room service snacks of champagne and \u2013 intriguingly \u2013 fresh spinach, the couple decamped to the neighbouring Commodore Hotel where, legend has it, they spun in the revolving doors for half an hour.</p> <p>Zelda had agreed to marry the 23-year-old Princeton graduate once he was a published author, and her gamble was soon to pay off.</p> <p>\u201cHe had been an advertising copywriter, and socialite Zelda Sayre wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with him. He had to convince her he was going somewhere,\u201d said Curnutt, an English professor at Troy University in Montgomery, Alabama, Zelda\u2019s home town.</p> <p>A local Montgomery bookshop, Read Herring, will be marking the occasion by giving its first drive-through customers copies of a new collection, published by NewSouth Books, of three short stories by Fitzgerald set in a fictionalised version of the town.</p> <p>By the end of April 1920 the author\u2019s debut novel had made his name. </p> <p>\u201c<em>This Side of Paradise</em> is a bold, almost cocky novel, and it came from nowhere,\u201d Philip McGowan, editor of a new Oxford World Classics print of the book, published next month, told the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>\u201cThe novel is important because it is his first one and not because it is especially well-crafted,\u201d McGowan added. \u201cIt sold better than <em>The Beautiful and Damned</em>, [<em>The Great</em>] <em>Gatsby</em> or <em>Tender is the Night</em>. </p> <p>\u201cSet in an America about to go into prohibition, it blasts a hole through 19th-century morality. It is really about teenagers having sex, and that was a bit of a shocker. All his later novels were measured against it, because it had broken the mould.\u201d </p> <p>A version of Zelda is a key character in <em>This Side of Paradise</em>, and she went on to inspire female characters throughout his fiction.</p> <p>\u201cHe wanted the book to secure Zelda and had promised the earth. This book tipped the scales for her, so they got married a few days later,\u201d said McGowan.</p> <p>Competing views of the marriage suggest that either he was a genius and she was \u201ca pain\u201d, said McGowan, or that he was \u201ccontrolling\u201d and she was undervalued. \u201cBoth are partly true, I think.\u201d </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 April 2020 to replace the photograph with one correctly showing Zelda and F Scott Fitzgerald. </p>",
  "<p><strong>Zsa Zsa Gabor, David Bowie </strong>and TV evangelists were obsessions of mine when I was eight years old. I was a weird, off-the-wall kid with a strange sense of humour, but I was surrounded by enough people who loved me and knew how to nurture me.</p> <p><strong>Growing up </strong>on a tiny island in northwest Washington was gorgeous. I lived by the water, raised a fawn, watched whales. My parents were quite conservative, but a lot of hippies lived in the area, so a real counterculture existed. </p> <p><strong>When I started learning </strong>how to use the bathroom I wasn\u2019t tall enough, so I had to rest my willy on the edge of the toilet bowl and, once, the lid came down and slammed it. The doctor at the emergency room said that if I\u2019d had a bone in it, I would have broken it.</p> <p><strong>My sleep life is very </strong>active. I snore, get sleep paralysis and have vivid dreams that I\u2019m able to control and then recall once I wake up. Sometimes it gets exhausting, so I have to turn them off slowly, like a tap.</p> <p><strong>Coming out at 15 </strong>in the early 1990s \u2013 the only gay kid in a giant public high school \u2013 was intense. I think I jumped the gun, opened the floodgates a little too wide. If I could go back, I would take stock of my surroundings and wait another year. Luckily, I was able to move through it without any real trauma.</p> <p><strong>Ten years ago</strong> I was adamant we needed more LGBTQ people in the public eye to be out. Now I think everyone\u2019s lives are on such display that keeping a semblance of privacy is almost more valuable. Most of it is no one\u2019s business.</p> <p><strong>Social media makes</strong> it easy to pass your insecurities on to other people. You might feel good about yourself, but someone else could pay the price. I\u2019m very conscious of that and use it a little, but mostly I keep away.</p> <p><strong>The United States has</strong> an administration that delights in sowing chaos and it\u2019s been tough on everyone. Most of my family are Republicans and some of them think homosexuality is a sin, but I truly don\u2019t care \u2013 we love each other very much. Bringing people together and spending quality time with them is more important. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to change minds.</p> <p><strong>God knows</strong>, I still love to party, but it\u2019s changed some. My 30s were wild and I wasn\u2019t necessarily on a great path, then I broke up with a partner and had to run away. I left LA and felt called to New Orleans. I love the culture \u2013 and the people are incredible. I didn\u2019t know a soul and had to rebuild my life, but I got to know myself again. </p> <p><strong>I\u2019ve always written</strong> stories and I studied fiction-writing before forming Scissor Sisters, so my next goal is getting the novel out. I can\u2019t imagine doing anything else except performing and writing. I was a charming but terrible waiter.</p> <p><strong>Wearing a full unicorn costume</strong> in the Masked Singer was one of the funnest but hardest things I\u2019ve ever done.

But, for some Republicans, it\u2019s also a political opportunity: anti-abortion activists are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/ohio-texas-abortion-us-coronavirus-outbreak\">ruthlessly using the pandemic</a> as an excuse to crack down on reproductive rights. Six conservative states \u2013 Indiana, Iowa, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas \u2013 have categorized abortions as non-essential, except in very limited cases, effectively banning access to the procedure during the pandemic.</p> <p>Federal judges have <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-04-02/red-states-block-abortion-coronavirus-outbreak\">stopped the bans from going into effect</a> in most of these states. However, on Tuesday an <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/emaoconnor/texas-abortion-ban-coronavirus-upheld-court\">appeals court ruled</a> that Texas could reinstate its abortion ban. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2020/04/01/texas-governor-says-attending-church-is-essential-but-abortions-can-wait-indefinitely/#4bbf89318ab3\">On the same day</a> women were told that their reproductive rights were considered dispensable, Texas\u2019s Governor Greg Abbott declared that religious services were \u201cessential\u201d and in-person gatherings could continue during the pandemic. This is despite the fact that there have been multiple cases of coronavirus spreading in <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2020/04/02/texas-churches-coronavirus-stay-open/\">places of worship</a>, with people dying as a result.</p> <p>Getting an abortion in Texas wasn\u2019t exactly easy before Covid-19; the state has <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-abortion-patients-20-times-longer-care/\">21 clinics for </a><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-abortion-patients-20-times-longer-care/\">6 million women of reproductive age</a>. But now desperate women are going to be forced to put themselves in danger by traveling long distances to get care in neighboring states. According to the <a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2020/04/covid-19-abortion-bans-would-greatly-increase-driving-distances-those-seeking-care\">Guttmacher Institute</a> the Texas ban has increased one-way distances to an abortion clinic from 12 miles to 243 miles; that\u2019s an increase of almost 2,000%. As is the case with all restrictions on abortion, the burden will fall disproportionately on low-income women without the resources to travel.</p> <p>It is also likely that the Texas abortion ban will result in more women attempting dangerous DIY procedures. According to a recent study women in Texas are already <a href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/DIY-abortion-attempts-three-times-as-prevalent-in-14962685.php\">three times more likely</a> to try to end their pregnancy on their own than women in other states.</p> <p>There is nothing pro-life about exploiting an emergency to further a political agenda. There\u2019s nothing pro-life about forcing women to give birth during a pandemic. There\u2019s nothing pro-life about women having to put themselves in danger to get the help they need, and the services the constitution is supposed to protect. But, as has always been clear, anti-abortion fanatics don\u2019t care about \u201clife\u201d, they care about control.</p> <p>The Texas abortion ban is supposed to be temporary. But our civil liberties are most fragile during times of fear and crisis; rights that are lost are not easily won back. It\u2019s not just our physical health that we need to worry about during this pandemic; it\u2019s the health of our democracy.

  "<p>The last time I was in the Lord\u2019s museum I spotted a letter of 1981 with the familiar Somerset CCC logo at the top in one of the display cabinets. It had been sent to Viv Richards and was the confirmation of his salary for the forthcoming season. At the bottom was Viv\u2019s signature. The sum agreed was just under \u00a39,000 for a six\u2011month contract. That equates to a salary of \u00a331,000 today.</p> <p>At the time Richards was the best batsman in the world, just as Brian Lara \u2013 arguably \u2013 was in 1994 when Warwickshire paid him \u00a340,000 for a season, which now equates to about \u00a368,000.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/03/englands-cricketers-to-hand-back-500000-and-donate-to-charities\">England's cricketers to hand back \u00a3500,000 and donate to charities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The point is simple. English cricketers are much better paid, both at international and domestic level, than they ever have been before. The figures may be pocket money for the top footballers in this country but England\u2019s Test cricketers earn between \u00a3300,000 and \u00a3500k per year, the white-ball cricketers between \u00a3200k and \u00a3300k and that does not include any income they might accrue from the various T20 leagues or endorsements/sponsorships.</p> <p>Even so, one can only applaud that they are willing to make a donation equivalent to 20% of their income over the next three months. Their contracts with the England and Wales Cricket Board were so watertight that they did not have to do this. But they did. It is worth noting, too, that this \u00a3500,000 is described as an \u201cinitial\u201d donation. So there is the assumption that there may be more to come.</p> <p>England\u2019s players via the Professional Cricketers\u2019 Association moved quickly, which is one of the advantages of being a small, tight-knit group. At the beginning of last week Joe Root was talking of looking into this \u201cover the next few weeks\u201d. However, with Premier League footballers being called out by government ministers last week they have accelerated.</p> <p>The outcome is not exactly what the ECB\u2019s chief executive, Tom Harrison, had sought in his letter to the PCA, which was a voluntary 20% reduction in their salary. Instead they are making a donation, which means they have more control over the destination of that \u00a3500,000, some of which will go to charities of their choice.</p> <p>Among the players and the PCA, confidence in how the ECB might use the extra cash may not be absolute. By contrast England Women have agreed to a more straightforward pay cut while their captain, Heather Knight, has offered herself as a NHS volunteer \u2013 so we should bang our pots and pans in her direction.</p> <p>Last summer the PCA was able to wring a very good deal from the ECB in return for its support for the Hundred. It was confirmed that \u00a38m would go to the players via the Hundred; the salary collar \u2013 the minimum spend on county squads \u2013 was doubled to \u00a31.5m and the new minimum wage for full-time professionals set at \u00a327,500. Understandably the PCA will be eager to retain all these commitments.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/21/cricket-enforced-pause-coronavirus-ecb-england-t20-blast-the-hundred\">Cricket could use its enforced pause to find a way forward | Vic Marks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As ever the greatest concerns lie beyond the international cricketers. Most of the counties are gratefully utilising the government\u2019s furlough scheme, but it is inevitable that they will have to reconsider their costs in the future. In short, the Covid-19 crisis will leave some professional cricketers vulnerable. Despite the salary collar, priorities may change and staffs may diminish. Hence the PCA, the clubs, the players and their agents have a difficult balancing act ahead of them. Demand too much and there will be fewer professional cricketers out there.</p> <p>In particular the decreasing band of red-ball specialists in county cricket, who are unlikely to be needed on a regular basis in the Blast \u2013 or the Hundred \u2013 may become less valued; some may become superfluous.</p> <p>The budding 18-year-old, whose recruitment represents a gamble, may no longer be offered that exploratory contract. The stalwart senior player, who is on a hefty contract, is also likely to be discarded \u2013 or asked to accept a reduced salary \u2013 far more frequently. It is estimated that 130 county cricketers will be out of contract at the end of the 2020 season and the PCA is eager that there should be some way to protect them come September.</p> <p>From every corner of the game there will have to be some give and take but at least our leading cricketers have shown a willingness to give this week.</p>",

When millions of us stepped out onto our doorsteps to applaud the carers visibly moved there was hope of a better future. In times like this, we need good government, a government that saves lives and protects our country.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019s a huge responsibility and whether we voted for this government or not, we all rely on it to get this right. That\u2019s why in the national interest the Labour Party will play its full part.</p> \n   <p>Under my leadership we will engage constructively with the government, not opposition for opposition\u2019s sake. Not scoring party political points or making impossible demands. But with the courage to support where that\u2019s the right thing to do.</p> \n   <p>But we will test the arguments that are put forward. We will shine a torch on critical issues and where we see mistakes or faltering government or things not happening as quickly as they should we\u2019ll challenge that and call that out.</p> \n   <p>Our purpose when we do that is the same as the government\u2019s, to save lives and to protect our country, a shared purpose.</p> \n   <p>But that is not the only task for the Labour party. The weeks ahead are going to be really difficult. I fear there are going to be some awful moments for many of us.</p> \n   <p>But we will get through this. The curve will flatten, the wards will empty, the immediate threat will subside. And we have scientists working on vaccines.</p> \n   <p>But when we do get through this we cannot go back to business as usual. This virus has exposed the fragility of our society. It\u2019s lifted a curtain.</p> \n   <p>Too many will have given too much. Some of us will have lost too much. We know in our hearts, things are going to have to change.</p> \n   <p>We can see so clearly now who the key workers really are.<br></p> \n   <p>When we get through this it\u2019ll be because of our NHS staff, our care workers, our ambulance drivers, our emergency services, our cleaners, our porters.</p> \n   <p>It will be because of the hard work and bravery of every key worker a they took on this virus and kept our country going.</p> \n   <p>For too long they\u2019ve been taken for granted and poorly paid. They were last and now they should be first.</p> \n   <p>In their courage and their sacrifice and their bravery, we can see a better future. This crisis has brought out the resilience and human spirit in all of us.</p> \n   <p>We must go forward with a vision of a better society built on that resilience and built on that human spirit. That will require bravery and change in our party as well.</p> \n   <p>I want to thank Rebecca and Lisa for running such passionate and powerful campaigns and for their friendship and support along the way.</p> \n   <p>I want to thank our Labour party staff who worked really hard and my own amazing campaign team, full of positivity, with that unifying spirit.</p> \n   <p>I want to pay tribute to Jeremy Corbyn, who led our party through some really difficult times, who energised our movement and who\u2019s a friend as well as a colleague.</p> \n   <p>And to all of our members, supporters and affiliates I say this: whether you voted for me or not I will represent you, I will listen to you and I will bring our party together.</p> \n   <p>But we have to face the future with honesty.</p> \n   <p>Antisemitism has been a stain on our party. I have seen the grief that it\u2019s brought to so many Jewish communities.</p> \n   <p>On behalf of the Labour party, I am sorry.</p> \n   <p>And I will tear out this poison by its roots and judge success by the return of Jewish members and those who felt that they could no longer support us.</p> \n   <p>The Labour party is an incredible and powerful force for good.</p> \n   <p>Together with those that went before us we\u2019ve changed the lives of millions of people for the better.</p> \n   <p>We created the NHS. We created the welfare state. We passed equalities legislation, the Race Relations Act, we set up the Open University. We built hospitals and schools, established Sure Start and played our part in bringing about peace in Northern Ireland.</p> \n   <p>But we\u2019ve just lost four elections in a row. We\u2019re failing in our historic purpose.</p> \n   <p>Be in no doubt I understand the scale of the task, the gravity of the position that we\u2019re in.</p> \n   <p>We\u2019ve got a mountain to climb.</p> \n   <p>But we will climb it, and I will do my utmost to reconnect us across the country, to re-engage with our communities and voters, to establish a coalition across our towns and our cities and our regions with all creeds and communities to speak for the whole of the country.</p> \n   <p>Where that requires change, we will change. Where that requires us to rethink, we will rethink.</p> \n   <p>Our mission has to be to restore trust in our party as a force for good and a force for change.</p> \n   <p>This is my pledge to the British people. I will do my utmost to guide us through these difficult times, to serve all of our communities and to strive for the good of our country.</p> \n   <p>I will lead this great party into a new era, with confidence and with hope.</p> \n   <p>So that when the time comes, we can serve our country again in government.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8859a18f080bdb9f534169\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T09:56:30.131Z\">10.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Angela Rayner elected Labour deputy leader</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And Angela Rayner is the new deputy leader, the Press Association has confirmed.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8859638f08c35a1d119e1c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T09:54:57.466Z\">10.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Labour has confirmed the result.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/UKLabour/status/1246375178684239874\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Congratulations to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Keir_Starmer?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Keir_Starmer</a>, the new Leader of the Labour Party!<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LabourLeadership?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LabourLeadership</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/i2PjxXaWMf\">pic.twitter.com/i2PjxXaWMf</a></p>\u2014 The Labour Party (@UKLabour) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UKLabour/status/1246375178684239874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 4, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8858ff8f080bdb9f534165\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T09:53:28.188Z\">10.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Keir Starmer elected Labour leader</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Sir Keir Starmer</strong> has won, the Press Association is reporting.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8858888f080bdb9f53415d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T09:51:23.097Z\">10.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.labour.org.uk/leadership2020\">The page on the Labour website</a>, where the leadership result is due to get posted, has crashed.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T10:38:15.628Z\">at 11.38am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e88582c8f08c35a1d119e0e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T09:50:00.027Z\">10.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is from Labour First, a Labour group supporting Sir Keir Starmer.

A majority of us are now floating voters, the book\u2019s seven authors argue.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When Butler and Stokes looked at panel data of vote choice in the 1960s, they observed that only around 13% of those who voted in both elections switched their vote choices between elections (Butler and Stokes 1969). They concluded that differential turnout and cohort replacement were the major drivers of electoral change. Slightly over a decade later, S\u00e4rlvik and Crewe (1983) saw sufficient change (21% of voters switched) that they considered there to have been a \u2018decade of dealignment\u2019. However, even the switching seen there seems modest when compared to the levels seen in 2015 (43%) and 2017 (33%). Across the four elections from 2005 to 2017, around 60 per cent of voters switched parties at least once.1 Far from being the minority of the electorate, swing voters \u2014 defined as people who switch their support to different parties between elections \u2014 now comprise the majority of the modern British electorate.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Here are two of the charts from the book that illustrate this point.</p> \n  <p>This chart shows the percentage of voters at general elections from 1966 onwards, voting for a different party from the one they backed at the previous election.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a517fb668cf8acdfe85f75fffe51bf38703158a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a517fb668cf8acdfe85f75fffe51bf38703158a/0_0_497_336/497..jpg\" alt=\"Individual-level voter volatility at general elections between 1966 and 2017.\" width=\"497\" height=\"336\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Individual-level voter volatility at general elections between 1966 and 2017.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Electoral Shocks</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>And this chart shows how the proportion of voters identifying with a particular party, and strongly identifying with a particular party, has declined over the same period.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7eb48d29d56cddeb920ce62e5a5355d5e4c74b8\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7eb48d29d56cddeb920ce62e5a5355d5e4c74b8/0_0_479_324/479..jpg\" alt=\"Electoral Shocks\" width=\"479\" height=\"324\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Electoral Shocks</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Declining levels of party identification since 1964/Electoral Shocks</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T09:46:27.483Z\">at 10.46am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e884f048f080bdb9f53412b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T09:19:26.968Z\">10.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boris Johnson says all parties 'have duty to work together at this moment of national emergency'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Some Conservatives have suggested that <strong>Boris Johnson </strong>should invite the next Labour leader to join <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/covid-coalition-government-considered-by-senior-conservatives\">some form of government of national unity to deal with the coronavirus crisis</a>.

  "<p>Three recent mobile phone mast fires around the UK are being investigated as possible arson, amid concerns that people are attacking telecoms infrastructure because of a conspiracy theory linking 5G technology to the spread of coronavirus.</p> \n<p>The mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, also revealed he had received threats relating to the \u201cbizarre\u201d theory, which has gained traction on social media.</p> \n<p>On Friday, emergency services were called to reports that a 5G mast was on fire in Liverpool shortly before 11pm. Police confirmed they were investigating the blaze at Spencer\u2019s Lane, Aintree, close to the M57 motorway.</p> \n<p>Fire crews managed to get the fire under control quickly and were photographed parked outside the field shortly after it was extinguished.</p> \n<p>The media regulator, Ofcom, said on Thursday it was monitoring broadcasters who spread the discredited conspiracy theory, although coverage has spread more widely on social networks, such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and Nextdoor.</p> \n<p>Speaking at Saturday\u2019s Downing Street press conference, cabinet secretary Michael Gove said the theories were \u201cdangerous nonsense\u201d. Professor Steve Powis, national medical director of NHS England, condemned them as \u201cthe worst kind of fake news\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m absolutely outraged, absolutely disgusted, that people would be taking action against the very infrastructure that we need to respond to this health emergency,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is absolute and utter rubbish.\u201d </p> \n<p>Just hours before the reported incident in Liverpool, Anderson dismissed the theories as \u201cbizarre\u201d. He said he was amazed by the amount of traction the conspiracy was getting on social media, and that all scientific and government advice showed the technology posed no harm to people.</p> \n<p>Speaking to the Guardian, the mayor revealed he had received threats relating to the theory and had reported them to Merseyside police.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe suggestion that Covid-19 is somehow linked to 5G is patently beyond the realms of credibility \u2013 utterly bizarre,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn Liverpool these masts are being upgraded and ironically the very people that are using this technology are the ones who are believing these theories. I was mildly threatened yesterday by someone telling me to take them down.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe reality is there is huge pressure on the network at the moment with so many people at home and that\u2019s why engineers are upgrading it. The idea that I have entered into some kind of machiavellian plot with the government is ridiculous.\u201d</p> \n<p>Social media posts from celebrities, such as the singer Anne-Marie, have helped spread the theory, while Amanda Holden, a judge on Britain\u2019s Got Talent, shared a link to an online petition promoting the false rumour that the symptoms of coronavirus are caused by residing near a 5G mast. The petition was removed following inquiries from the Guardian.</p> \n<p>Cheers actor Woody Harrelson and former Dancing on Ice judge Jason Gardiner are also among stars who have shared theories.</p> \n<p>The government is increasingly concerned about the impact of the spread of such false theories.</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport, which has responsibility for telecoms policy, warned people to stop damaging key infrastructure during a national emergency: \u201cThese are baseless theories, there is absolutely no credible evidence of a link between 5G and coronavirus. Threats or violence towards any key worker or damage to mobile phone masts will not be tolerated.\u201d</p> \n<p>On Thursday, police in Belfast appealed for information after a mobile phone mast was damaged in an arson attack, with online footage suggesting the motive was opposition to 5G networks.</p> \n<p>The video clip shows an incident on the Antrim Road in north Belfast on Thursday night, in which flames can be seen at the base of a mobile telephone mast.</p> \n<p>According to a report in the <a href=\"https://www.irishnews.com/coronavirus/2020/04/04/news/police-appeal-for-witnesses-to-5g-arson-attack-on-phone-mast-1890409/\">Irish News</a>, voices can be heard stating \u201cFuck the 5G\u201d and \u201cViva la revolution\u201d as the fire burns.</p> \n<p>Facebook removed one anti-5G group in which members were being encouraged to supply footage of them destroying mobile phone equipment. Video footage of a 70ft (20m) telephone mast on fire in Birmingham this week has also circulated widely alongside claims it was targeted by anti-5G protesters.</p> \n<p>The problem has become so bad that engineers working for Openreach, which provides home broadband services, have posted pleas on anti-5G Facebook groups, asking to be spared from on-street abuse as they are not involved in maintaining mobile networks.</p> \n<p>The industry lobby group Mobile UK said the incidents were affecting efforts to maintain networks that were supporting home working and providing critical connectivity to the emergency services, vulnerable consumers and hospitals. Telecoms engineers are considered key workers under the government\u2019s guidelines.</p> \n<p>International radiation experts have repeatedly made clear that the new high-speed telephone system does not pose a risk to humans, while pointing out that the coronavirus has spread widely in many countries without any 5G coverage, such as Iran.</p>",
  "<p>In most countries, slogans about the national effort to combat coronavirus have focused on survival or the human spirit. Iran has gone for the simple approach (\u201c<a href=\"http://www.iran-daily.com/News/267142.html?catid=3&amp;title=Tehran-s-Azadi-Tower-lightened-to-white-to-honor-medical-staff\">Stay at home</a>\u201d), Switzerland the communal (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-51658511\">This affects us all</a>\u201d), Italy is trying to spread a message of reassurance (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/everything-will-be-alright-italians-share-slogan-of-hope-in-face-of-coronavirus-crisis\">Everything will be all right</a>\u201d), India is pleading (\u201cGo corona go!\u201d) and practical (\u201c<a href=\"http://tehelka.com/prepare-dont-panic-indias-guiding-mantra-to-tackle-covid-19-pm-modi-to-saarc-leaders/\">Prepare, don\u2019t panic</a>\u201d), and Argentina is focusing on gratitude to health workers (\u201cThanks from my heart\u201d). Meanwhile, China has gone for the direct approach: \u201c<a href=\"https://supchina.com/2020/02/11/all-the-hilariously-aggressive-coronavirus-banners-found-in-china/\">If you hang out in public today / Grass will grow on your grave next year</a>.\u201d</p> \n<p>But the British government has opted for a different focus. With \u201cStay at home, protect the NHS and save lives\u201d, the message seems to be if you act responsibly you can protect your prized asset \u2013 and, as a byproduct, that will save lives.</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson, of course, has form with vacuous three-word slogans \u2013 be it \u201cTake back control\u201d or \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d. And now we have a triptych slogan \u2013 three three-worders for the price of one. The first and last bit make perfect sense. Of course, we should stay at home to save lives. It\u2019s only when you add the bit in the middle that the slogan becomes questionable.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance-friday\">Coronavirus latest: at a glance</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>First, there\u2019s the rank hypocrisy of a government that has spent 10 years doing the exact opposite of ordering us to protect the NHS. In fact, the Tory-led coalition was so little trusted with the NHS that David Cameron had to create his own slogan in 2011 to reassure the public: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/251349/Cameron-NHS-is-safe-in-our-hands\">The NHS is safe in our hands</a>\u201d.</p> \n<p>Over the next decade, the Tories went on to neglect the NHS at best, pillage it at worst. Pre-Covid-19, the number of NHS <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/25/hospital-beds-at-record-low-in-england-as-nhs-struggles-with-demand\">hospital beds</a> had fallen dramatically and we were short of an estimated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/25/boris-johnson-conservatives-nhs-funding\">43,000 nurses</a>.</p> \n<p>The Tory government also did its best to quietly sell off parts of the NHS. In 2013 the government sold 80% of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/25/uk-blood-plasma-company-sale-nhs-supplies\"> the state-owned blood plasma supplier</a> to the US private equity firm Bain Capital for $200m. This despite the obscenity of Britain\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-43910567\">contaminated blood scandal</a> when more than 4,500 haemophiliacs became infected with hepatitis and HIV in the 1970s and 1980s after being poisoned with blood products brought on the cheap from abroad. In 2016 Britain\u2019s plasma supplier was <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-bio-products-our-blood-plasma-supplier-ended-up-with-china-zg00fthqn\">sold on</a> to a Chinese company for \u00a3820m (along with the government\u2019s remaining 20% stake). Protect the NHS? The Tories flogged the country\u2019s lifeblood for tuppence ha\u2019penny.</p> \n<p>Johnson talks with pride about \u201cour NHS\u201d and our heroic NHS workers. Yet this is the same man who voted against scrapping the 1% pay-rise cap for NHS nurses in 2017, and was a member of the government that cheered when a pay rise for nurses was blocked.</p> \n<p>Then it was the turn of the health secretary, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foAYpXqzUtQ\">Matthew Hancock,</a> to tell us how proud he was of us for staying at home, protecting the NHS and saving lives. </p> \n<p>There is something distasteful about a government telling us to protect the NHS when the government itself is so obviously failing to do so in this terrible crisis. As of Thursday, only <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51943612\">7,000</a> out of 550,000 frontline NHS workers have been tested for Covid-19. Not only does this<strong> </strong>mean the government is failing to protect the NHS and its workers \u2013 it hasn\u2019t even been able to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/nhs-staff-protection-doctor-ppe-coronavirus\">provide the required personal protective equipment</a> \u2013 it is, in turn, failing to protect us all because the public could be treated by infected staff members.</p> \n<p>But there\u2019s something about \u201cStay at home, protect the NHS and save lives\u201d that offends on an even deeper level. The slogan is a throwback to the Vote Leave campaign of 2016, which also famously weaponised the NHS. Back then, Johnson was pictured in front of a campaign bus with the following words plastered across it: \u201cWe send the EU \u00a3350million a week, let\u2019s fund our NHS instead.\u201d (A figure that <a href=\"https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/boris-johnson-350-million-a-week-nhs-claim-1-6264572\">he later revised</a> downwards by \u00a3100m). Johnson has always been aware that the NHS is an emotional trigger for the British people, and he has been quick to exploit it. This time round, he\u2019s using it just as cynically \u2013 but rather than bribing us with what can be added to the NHS, he\u2019s threatening us with what we can lose. Johnson is toying not only with our pride in the health service, but also our sense of ownership of it.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/30/coronavirus-crisis-tories-cuts\">In this crisis, the Tory cuts can no longer be hidden by empty gestures | Nesrine Malik</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Whether carrot or stick, it is offensive to assume we need an incentive to save lives.

But we are bigger and better than that. However much we love the NHS, however much we want to protect the NHS, we are staying at home to save lives \u2013 not to safeguard our national assets.

The date is set by federal law and Donald Trump has no power to delay it alone. That would require legislation enacted by Congress and signed by the president. Such an outcome still remains unthinkable to most. But many unthinkable events have unfolded in the last month.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re in completely uncharted waters here and I don\u2019t think anybody knows what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.fordham.edu/info/24277/ma_in_elections_and_campaign_management_faculty/6866/monika_l_mcdermott\">Monika McDermott</a>, a political science professor at Fordham University in New York. \u201cBy November the picture might be completely unrecognisable.

There\u2019s talk out there about postponing it or changing it to a mail-in only election.\u201d</p> <p>The profound uncertainty has upended political campaigns like nothing else in living memory. It was a month ago \u2013 3 March \u2013 that the former vice-president Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/03/joe-biden-super-tuesday-victory-democratic-primary\">won 10 states on Super Tuesday</a>, the biggest day in the primary calendar, and took firm control of the Democratic race. Trump, meanwhile, was holding regular campaign rallies in packed arenas.</p> <p>Now, Biden finds himself holed up in his basement in Wilmington, Delaware, struggling to break into the national conversation through TV interviews and virtual campaign events. Trump has been denied the lifeblood of rallies but switched to his other favourite medium \u2013 television \u2013 with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/donald-trump-coronavirus-briefings-2020-campaign-rallies\">daily coronavirus taskforce briefings</a> from the White House. <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president_trump_job_approval-6179.html\">Polls suggest</a> he is benefiting moderately from a \u201crally around the flag effect\u201d.</p> <p>Media coverage that would normally be all about the race for the White House is dominated instead by an extraordinary public health and economic crisis, with the US <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/04/01/coronavirus-latest-news/\">death toll from the virus expected to top 100,000</a>. Trump and Biden continue to work on the assumption that, come November, the worst of the pandemic will be over.

But Wisconsin <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/politics/wisconsin-primary-april-7-coronavirus/index.html\">intends to go ahead next week,</a> despite legal challenges, an objection from Sanders and shortages of poll workers that could force the national guard to step in.</p> <p>June will now be a bumper month, with nearly 700 delegates up for grabs in 10 states and the District of Columbia on 2 June alone \u2013 assuming the primaries can go ahead.

Faced with the inconsistency of states voting on different dates, Congress passed a law in 1845 that stipulated federal elections must be held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November (the day and time of year were chosen to suit farmers).</p> <p>Congress would have to pass a new law to postpone the 2020 election and even then would run into constitutional hurdles stating the new Congress must be sworn in on 3 January and the new president\u2019s term must begin on 20 January.</p> <p>The inauguration date was set in 1933 when the 20th amendment to the constitution was ratified. There have only been 27 amendments in all. To make another, revising the inauguration date, would require approval by a two-thirds majority of both the House of Representatives and Senate, then ratification by three-quarters of the states.</p> <p>If the election does go ahead as expected on 3 November, states that already allow early and absentee voting will be well placed. Washington state, for example, has carried out elections by mail for years and its primary last month went ahead as planned. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/paloma/the-trailer/2020/04/02/the-trailer-the-fear-and-politics-around-expanding-voting-by-mail/5e84980e602ff10d49ada414/\">But 17 states require some kind of excuse</a> for requesting an absentee ballot.

One challenge is the United States postal service is economically unstable, so vote by mail may not be as simple as it seems right now.\u201d</p> <p>Such logistical problems could fuel concerns over the result in what is expected to be another very close election, Jones added. \u201cWe could end up with concerns about the legitimacy of the election.

I think people should vote with ID \u2013 voter ID. I think voter ID is very important and the reason they don\u2019t want voter ID is because they intend to cheat. </p> <p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be mail-in voting. It should be: you go to a booth and you proudly display yourself. You don\u2019t send it in the mail where people pick up \u2013 all sorts of bad things can happen by the time they signed that, if they signed that by the time it gets in and is tabulated.\u201d</p> <p>Republicans have long stoked fears of fraud in mail-in voting. But according to the Washington Post, in Washington state\u2019s last election, 4.4m ballots were cast but fewer than a hundred were flagged and none led to a criminal fraud investigation.</p> <p>What remains unknown is whether the pandemic will help or hurt Trump at the ballot box. He declared a national emergency on 13 March but has been fiercely condemned for previously downplaying the virus, squandering crucial weeks and leaving the country unprepared. The president has \u201chas blood on his hands\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/03/30/opinion/president-unfit-pandemic/\">argued the Boston Globe editorial board</a> this week, while Biden\u2019s supporters say the former vice-president would bring precisely the stable leadership the country needs.</p> <p>The PRRI says that, in less than three weeks, Trump has seen the highest increase in his favourability rating since the institute began tracking it in 2015. Its analysis of 1,008 adults polled between 17 and 22 March found that overall Trump\u2019s favorability increased from 40% in February to 49% in March, with unfavorable opinion decreasing 10 points. Favourability in the battleground states of Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin jumped 13 points.</p> <p>Jones explained: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a typical American reaction at times of national crisis, a \u2018<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/01/coronavirus-trump-bump-polls\">rally around the flag effect</a>\u2019. It happened with George W Bush after 9/11 and Barack Obama after the killing of Osama bin Laden.

He does not take advice. He\u2019s headstrong and he insists on what his gut tells him to do. He\u2019s in a precarious position and I don\u2019t think this pandemic changes it. If anything, it illustrates why he\u2019s in that precarious position.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>I was in the midst of the usual reporter\u2019s juggle, trying to write on a notepad balanced on one thigh while resting a dictation machine on the other, when the prime minister\u2019s tone suddenly changed, prompting me to look up.

You could hear a pin drop as we listened to the rest of Johnson\u2019s address. Just inside Downing Street\u2019s side door, where we retrieved belongings such as phones and laptopsthat are not allowed in the main building, we hurriedly rang newsdesks to double-check they had heard Johnson\u2019s startling words for themselves.

Because I happened to be passing through Victoria in London one day at the end of January, I was sent to the Department of Health\u2019s press conference. There, the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, told us two people from the same family were being treated for the virus at the infectious disease unit at Newcastle\u2019s Royal Infirmary. It took a newspaper\u2019s general reporters just a matter of hours to find out the pair were holidaymakers from China staying at a hotel in York. For weeks, we watched what was happening in China and our questions to Downing Street were about how to get people back from Wuhan and the quarantine facility set up in Wirral, interspersed with the usual topics such as Brexit, HS2 and floods.</p> <p>By early March, it was clear cases were rising, and we were invited to helpful technical briefings with Whitty and the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, held in No 9 Downing Street, and on one occasion upstairs in No 10, in the beautiful Pillared Room, which we usually only see once a year at the prime minister\u2019s Christmas reception for journalists. We got the government\u2019s Covid-19 strategy an hour before one of the press conferences to familiarise ourselves with it. It was there we saw the shocking estimate that up to a fifth of the workforce could be off sick. Trump-style, Johnson took questions from nearly every reporter in the room \u2013 staying far longer than usual. The day hadn\u2019t all been smooth, though. At one point we were herded out of No 9\u2019s lobby meeting room to get ready for the press conference and left filing copy crouched on the paving slabs of the country\u2019s most famous street. A reporter from the Financial Times, Laura Hughes, and I talked about how filing from roadsides felt like general election territory.</p> <p>Journalists continued to traipse into Downing Street for the daily televised press conferences in person until the weekend of 21-22 March, every day feeling more anxious in the office, sharing stories of relatives\u2019 and friends\u2019 health. The last one I attended personally was on Thursday 19 March, when, in a nod to social distancing, the chairs were arranged in a staggered way. This should have happened days earlier. I was sitting near Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby, ITV\u2019s Robert Peston and the Guido Fawkes reporter Tom Harwood. It was one of Johnson\u2019s more bizarre performances, where he asked us all if it was useful to keep doing the question and answer sessions, and joked about wearying us with them. We had a brief chat surrounding the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman and press secretary afterwards, known as a \u201chuddle\u201d, where we were told journalists would be key workers. We all knew we were standing too close and broke it up after a few minutes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ec8c3f57981b40c1c30706ad7d5726af7dc5eec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ec8c3f57981b40c1c30706ad7d5726af7dc5eec/0_0_3500_2100/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A virtual press conference in Downing Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A virtual press conference in Downing Street.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: 10 Downing Street/Crown copyright/Andrew Parsons/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The next day we all began working from home and set about creating weird and wonderful office spaces. Mine is in a room stuffed to the rafters with my landlady\u2019s belongings. I only have to do a 180-degree spin on my chair to be able to retrieve alpine walking poles, an artist\u2019s easel and some MiracleGro. None of us really said goodbye to each other in Westminster, but in hindsight it might have been wise to acknowledge the fact that we were decamping from our perilously tatty offices in Westminster for an unknown amount of time. We\u2019re social beings and thrive off each other.</p> <p>Like the rest of the country, we\u2019re doing Zoom calls and Google Hangouts, and it\u2019s tough. Not seeing colleagues is a huge miss. While WhatsApping MPs is fine, there\u2019s nothing quite like bumping into them or seeing who is in conversation with who in the Portcullis House coffee shop. I\u2019ve done Radio 4\u2019s Westminster Hour over FaceTime and the BBC\u2019s The Papers over Skype, all without any trouble, except accidentally capturing my shared house\u2019s drinks collection in the background.</p> <p>Downing Street has been accommodating by turning our daily meetings into a daily teleconference, expertly chaired by the Daily Mail\u2019s political editor, Jason Groves. We usually get to ask our own questions when we\u2019re all sitting in No 9, but it\u2019s easier for the flow of the call if Jason groups them together and asks the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman. More than 100 people are listening in, and like the rest of the country we\u2019re struggling with the mute button!</p> <p>The press conferences are welcome, but not ideal in a virtual format. We\u2019re on a rota system for questions and mine was this Sunday gone, which saw me propping up my phone on boxes and books to get the right angle. The ministers take your questions but the format means you cannot follow up, which means they are getting away with an awful lot of waffle and non-answers. And this hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by the public, or our readers. If we could get a right of reply to our questions I think it would be more worthwhile for everyone.</p> <p>We have many more weeks to go of this entirely new lobby reporting structure. Everyone has adapted, but the real challenge will be when politicians are added back into the mix after recess. That\u2019s when the government\u2019s digital communications will be tested again, because if one thing is certain, it\u2019s not just the journalists hungry to scrutinise the executive. The MPs I\u2019ve spoken to cannot wait to get stuck in. They\u2019ve seen our daily Q&amp;A with ministers, and they want their own.</p>",
  "<p>The country today <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/04/keir-starmer-wins-labour-leadership-election\">gains an opposition leader</a> who will for the first time subject the government\u2019s competence in this coronavirus crisis to relentless scrutiny. The political landscape will be recast beyond recognition. Where there was no effective opposition, a void, a limbo, now in Keir Starmer the party has a grand prosecutor well qualified to hold the government\u2019s feet to the fire. Until now Boris Johnson had nothing to fear from a four-times vanquished and demoralised foe, with a leader so discredited a plurality of his<strong> </strong>own voters<strong> </strong>tell YouGov he <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2020/04/02/96f89/2?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=daily_questions&amp;utm_campaign=question_1\">changed their party for the worse</a>. From now on Johnson faces the challenge of an unrecognisably remade opposition.

No digging has found anything but decency and a background of pro bono work: \u201ca bit dull\u201d is the worst they can think of. Not since Tony Blair in 1994 has a Labour leader emerged from the party\u2019s byzantine structures with support from every section, backed by a majority of MPs, trade unions, affiliates and now its members, too. He has promised unity and this solid support may augur an end to the party\u2019s civil wars. The respectful tone of the leadership campaign in the three finalists\u2019 hustings drew praise from all sides: peace was possible. His cool authority swayed many Jeremy Corbyn supporters and Momentum members, when only a short while ago it was glumly assumed only a Corbynite stood a chance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/mar/30/labour-leadership-interviews-sir-keir-starmer\">Labour leadership interviews: Sir Keir Starmer \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The sheer scale of last December\u2019s electoral rout, gifting Boris Johnson an 80-seat majority, sent a seismic shock through the party membership. Activists contended with the raw incompetence of every aspect of the Corbyn-led campaign, from his incredible manifesto, ballooning weekly with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/14/general-election-pay-gap-promises-from-labour-and-lib-dems-as-johnson-navigates-floods-anger-live-news\">new billions pledged</a>, to basic failures to deliver election leaflets on time. Many were appalled to encounter voters, not just in north London but in the north of England, too, revolted by the party\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/09/jews-brexit-boris-johnson-jeremy-corbyn\">failure to root out antisemitism</a>. Starmer\u2019s slogan, \u201cAnother future is possible\u201d, felt as vital for the party itself as for the country.</p> <p>A new leader has a short time to signal to voters that this is a party transformed. Using the very thing that most shamed Labour, his first totemic act will be to summon representatives of the Jewish community to help him set up a rigorously independent process to expunge the antisemites: never again those weasel excuses, \u201cwe oppose all forms of racism\u201d.</p> <p>What a hard time to arrive in post. Stricken and locked-down, there is no appetite for party politics as Britain, like every other country, at least temporarily rallies round the government of the day: up against a near-zero opposition, YouGov this week scored Johnson the <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1264105/boris-johnson-approval-rating-tory-government-popularity-yougov-coronavirus\">highest positive rating</a> of any government since 2003 \u2013 because nothing can save us but the state. After Corbyn\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52048213\">unseemly gloating</a> that coronavirus proved his policies right, expect pitch-perfect nuance from Starmer. He conceded in his webinar with members this week, \u201cany government would struggle\u201d, before pointing to confused messages, slow action and the harsh light the crisis has shone on a decade of austerity. Steering off callow opportunism, expect forensically focused critiques to make this ill-prepared government writhe. Even the Tory press howls at its shocking ineptitude and dishonesty about testing and protective equipment.</p> <p>Where does Starmer stand? Treading the tightrope stretched across a divided party, some Corbynites suspect he\u2019s a covert Blairite, while some pragmatists worry about his radical pledges. These include \u201ccommon ownership\u201d of rail, mail, energy and water, but wait for interpretations: it need not mean Whitehall-run monoliths. Costly though it is, expect no backsliding on free tuition fees, because he sincerely believes in universal free education. But without power, policies are tinkling cymbals: ahead is the long, hard slog of solid and skilful opposition. In the aftermath of coronavirus and Brexit, plunged into a depressed economy, no one can guess the mood of politics in four years\u2019 time, but there is every reason to think this singularly ill-equipped government will not come through it well \u2013 and Keir Starmer will.</p> <p>On Sunday, when he announces his new shadow cabinet, it will stand in stark contrast to Boris Johnson\u2019s team. An ill-assorted cabinet, chosen for hot Brexit passions not character or competence in a crisis, will face an impressively capable line-up on the bench opposite. Gone will be the more comically inept Labour spokesmen of recent years. While Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey have been promised places, new faces will be the story of day. Waiting on the backbenches is an array of talent to choose from, with an exceptionally strong cohort of women \u2013 there are too many to list.</p> <p>Corbyn apparatchiks must go, but a Labour leader doesn\u2019t directly control the party machine. Power to remove chief officers rests with the national executive committee, which may at first look finely balanced. But with Starmer arriving with the wind in his sails, support for the dead regime may fade away, just as Militant vanished into the ether. Momentum itself has changed: Laura Parker, its national co-ordinator, is a Starmer campaigner and an emblem of the party\u2019s future, unlike Momentum\u2019s founder, Jon Lansman, a veteran Bennite. Will there be peace at last? Rule changes require consent of the unruly party conference floor, whose votes are needed to reform the divisive trigger ballots and reselections of MPs that spread so much bitterness through local parties. Commanding his party may seem a petty irrelevance in the force-nine gale of the coronavirus crisis, but a leader without a grip on their party looks an unconvincing prime minister of the nation. Here is the transformation: in selecting Starmer, Labour in all its divisions shows it has at last emerged as a serious party determined on seeking power.</p> <p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>I realised while watching The Repair Shop (Wednesday, 8pm, BBC One; also weekdays, 4.30pm) that I hadn\u2019t seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/05/treasures-in-the-loft-an-antiques-roadshow-photo-essay\">Antiques Roadshow</a> for years. I should explain: The Repair Shop is the hip younger brother to Antiques Roadshow, in that Antiques Roadshow is passive (people bring things to be appraised, cooed over, then neatly packaged away), while The Repair Shop is active (people bring things to be appraised, cooed over, ripped apart entirely, then reupholstered).</p> <p>My body has a violent Pavlovian response to the Antiques Roadshow theme tune. When I was a child, its opening strings heralded the end of the weekend as I knew it, and now when I hear that little trumpeting title tune my spine stiffens, my neck runs wild with goosebumps and my mind is plunged into inescapable Sunday Night Dread. So yeah, I don\u2019t watch Antiques Roadshow any more.</p> <p>The Repair Shop taps into a similar vibe, though: the quiet appreciation of old things; soft tittering; people with practical haircuts telling slightly-too-long stories about their mothers; Antiques People, with their violent shirts and two pairs of glasses round their neck on a cord; the middle classes sincerely describing things as \u201cmarvellous\u201d. The premise of The Repair Shop \u2013 people bring significant old things from their family home to be fully repaired, telling a story about who bought it and how old it is and why it got so worn out and in need of repair in the first place, then leaving it for six weeks before coming back and crying at how good it now looks \u2013 shouldn\u2019t, in any universe or along any timeline, be in any way entertaining at all. And yet.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOWSO7xy0z8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bOWSO7xy0z8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Since learning the word \u201cjeopardy\u201d only a few years ago, I have always said it aloud to people when I am watching films, stating whether a film has either too much or too little jeopardy, according to a scoring structure that is constantly moving in my mind (sneaking out of a room without being seen, for example; jumping from one spaceship to another without a safety rope; a dead phone battery, meaning you cannot text to check you are invited to the end-of-high-school party). The exact inverse of this \u201cjeopardy\u201d is the less-appreciated \u201ccosiness\u201d, a quality tangible to a select few TV shows, but no less important. The Repair Shop absolutely drips with cosy. It is ripe with cosy. Cosy overfloweth. They rub cosy into old wood and it comes up in a lustrous new glow.</p> <p>I could pretend The Repair Shop taps into something deeper \u2013 a polite tut in the face of our throwaway culture, a reminder of how Making Do And Mending still has a place in a world of online shopping and single-use plastic \u2013 but that\u2019s not really the point. The point is it\u2019s cosy. Never has a TV show so successfully synthesised such a particular sense of nostalgia: the feeling of lying sideways on your nan\u2019s sofa (the one she doesn\u2019t let anyone put her feet up on apart from you), grey rain tapping at the window, milky tea and biscuits on a plate on their way, two more hours and a round of meat paste sandwiches away from your dad picking you up and driving you, mouth-open asleep in the back of the car, all the way home. The fact that it manages to do all this with nothing more than \u201cfootage of someone quietly making a cog\u201d is something akin to a miracle.</p>",
  "<p>Detainees in a US immigration jail are begging to be released after potential Covid-19 exposure, saying the conditions are so brutal that they would rather suffer deportation<strong> </strong>than remain locked up.</p> <p>Three men incarcerated at the Winn correctional center in a remote part of Louisiana told the Guardian that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has isolated 44 of them together after they were possibly exposed to coronavirus. Some of the detainees are so desperate to leave that they are seeking voluntary deportation. They say their cries for masks, hand sanitizer, gloves and cleaning supplies have gone ignored, including for elderly detainees and those with asthma.</p> <p>In a series of phone calls, the men described a nightmare ordeal over the last two weeks, citing rampant mistreatment and a terrifying lack of information from Ice after they learned they were under some kind of quarantine. They also said that seven of their fellow detainees were deported on a flight to Colombia this week, four days into a 14-day quarantine period, which would appear to violate basic standards of coronavirus containment.</p> <p>Their firsthand accounts escalate concerns that human rights lawyers have been raising for weeks, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/29/detainees-coronavirus-us-immigration-ice\">Ice jails could become death traps</a> during the pandemic and that the only way to save lives and slow the spread is to release people en masse.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are writing to the judge that they want to be deported as soon as possible. They don\u2019t want to continue fighting,\u201d said a detainee from El Salvador in his 30s, who declined to give his name. He said he was trying to self-deport and was also helping an asylum seeker seek deportation. \u201cHe told me, \u2018I\u2019d prefer to go home instead of being in this jail.\u2019 \u2026 Ice has to release all the people, immediately.\u201d</p> <p>One of the detainees speaking out and advocating for the release of immigrant prisoners is Dr Sirous Asgari, an Iranian scientist who was exonerated in a US trial last year but continues to face detention. The 59-year-old professor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/sirous-asgari-coronavirus-us-ice-immigration-detention\">shared his story with the Guardian</a> last week, prompting Iran\u2019s foreign minister to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JZarif/status/1243504082050068481\">call</a> for his release.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"653a1b5e92f11e5fedf550fce62cf0bfd364e7f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/653a1b5e92f11e5fedf550fce62cf0bfd364e7f2/0_327_4032_2419/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Sirous Asgari at his graduation from Drexel University.

He heard that a detainee had a fever. But Ice, he alleged, gave the detainees no information and declined to tell them whether it was Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody got panicked,\u201d he said, describing a chaotic scene of the detainees yelling for help and information. \u201cWe had two elderly people in their 70s, younger people with respiratory problems. One guy is crying, saying, \u2018My life is in danger, we have been exposed.\u2019 People were screaming, \u2018Give us masks!\u2019 \u2026 \u2018We\u2019re gonna die!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>One officer suggested there was nothing to worry about, but then staff kept the pod completely isolated from other detainees, suggesting they were under quarantine, Asgari said. Despite what seemed to be a strict quarantine, seven of them were deported to Colombia a few days later, he said.</p> <p>Roughly 30 men who remained behind were then taken to Winn, but were still given no information, the detainees said. But once they had medical visits, he said they confirmed their fears after asking the nurse to look at their records, which all said \u201cpossible exposure to Covid-19\u201d and listed as 8 April as a \u201crelease date\u201d which would be the end of a 14-day quarantine period. The men joined a dozen other detainees in that facility who were also suspected of having exposure, Asgari said.</p> <p>Bryan Cox, an Ice spokesman, declined to respond to many of their specific claims, but said no detainee has tested positive for Covid-19 at ASF. He did not answer questions about whether the men were given tests or whether there was a direct exposure or quarantine. He said Ice groups detainees in \u201cmedical cohorts\u201d, meaning separating potential Covid-19 patients from others, but said that a \u201ccohort for potential exposure does not mean a person has been exposed\u201d.</p> <p>He said the men were spreading \u201cunsubstantiated rumor and false allegations\u201d, but did not offer specifics.</p> <p>\u201cWe are just a number to them. They don\u2019t care,\u201d said a detainee in his 30s who is facing deportation to Guatemala, and was also moved from ASF to Winn alongside Asgari. \u201cI\u2019m really afraid \u2026 They put you in jail with all these people and you don\u2019t know where they\u2019ve come from. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p> <p>This detainee said he had lived in the US for more than a decade and that he was arrested in New York in mid-March as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/31/ice-raids-coronavirus-n95-masks\">Ice continued its raids and arrests</a> amid the worsening pandemic. He said he has little information about his case and is fighting to get out: \u201cI\u2019m trying to do something, but I can\u2019t. I haven\u2019t seen a judge, nothing. They are just moving me around.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Disgusting\u2019 conditions and silence from Ice</h2> <p>The men said the conditions at Winn were appalling. The detainees are responsible for all cleaning, and there is a single shower and only two toilets for all 44 of them to share. They are also sleeping on beds roughly two feet apart from each other, and the humidity when they first arrived left the sheets wet and beds rusted, they alleged.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we got inside, everyone was absolutely shocked at the living conditions,\u201d said Asgari, who has a history of respiratory problems and is at risk of death. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating, disgusting and humiliating. We get outside for one hour a day. That\u2019s the only good thing.\u201d</p> <p>By Friday, a majority of the detainees were suffering from some kind of cold, according to Asgari, who said he now has a bad cough and fears it will infect his lungs. They don\u2019t have fevers, and he said he hopes it\u2019s not coronavirus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4edf433365dfc9309bac1535e78e52ad3ffe389\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4edf433365dfc9309bac1535e78e52ad3ffe389/0_95_2845_1707/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A bed at the Winn correctional center where some migrants have been isolated after exposure to coronavirus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bed at the Winn correctional center where some migrants have been isolated after exposure to coronavirus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerald Herbert/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The man from El Salvador said the staff at Winn were taking their temperatures daily, but otherwise doing little else related to Covid-19 prevention. He said Ice should consider releasing them in the US for their own safety, noting that he didn\u2019t know the status of the outbreak in El Salvador and whether it would be dangerous to return. But ultimately, he said he was desperate to get out, fearing staff could bring the virus to the facility or that he could be moved again and exposed to hundreds more detainees in other jails.</p> <p>One Ice officer told him he could submit a formal request and get a reply in seven or eight days, he said: \u201cI want to know what is happening with us.

Right now your garden, particularly if you are the sort to shun gardening, is already dotted with free food that is good for you.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d07e8d73bc452634d3bdfb9a6c3ef1ae8fe83f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d07e8d73bc452634d3bdfb9a6c3ef1ae8fe83f5/0_2253_3435_2235/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Broccoli microgreens.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"651\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Broccoli microgreens: the leaves may be small, but they are packed full of nutrients.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bittercress, <em>Cardamine hirsuta</em>, is one of my favourite salad greens: a tiny rosette-forming weed with a flavour somewhere between wasabi and rocket \u2013 and not a hint of bitterness. You can eat it at any stage, but it\u2019s particularly good when in flower, which happens to be now. Look for it in damp spots, around the base of pots and at path edges.</p> <p>Chickweed, <em>Stellaria media</em>, is rich in vitamin C and a delicious alternative to lettuce; it makes a great base for salads or can be whizzed up raw into a very good pesto for all that pasta. Again, it likes bare ground, damp spots and edges. Both these plants are low-growing and will need a good wash to avoid getting grit in your salad.</p> <p>Finally, there\u2019s dandelion, an excellent tonic, particularly for the liver, and rich in potassium. Pick the youngest leaves for raw salads. They work well with potatoes, onions, and those tinned sardines you\u2019ve been stockpiling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2761cca8834bbe564157c3c9f8051f52ef4cc04c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2761cca8834bbe564157c3c9f8051f52ef4cc04c/0_925_3378_2027/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hairy Bittercress.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hairy bittercress: a flavour somewhere between wasabi and rocket.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you don\u2019t have a garden, then check the back of your cupboard for something to sprout.

You can eat the whole sprout raw, seed and all, but don\u2019t eat too many of the legumes, raw or cooked, or you\u2019ll get indigestion. You can also try cooking with sprouted chickpeas, beans, spelt, rye and barley.

Discard any seeds that are damaged, then add a handful to your jar. Add at least double the volume of water, and soak overnight, covering the jar with the muslin. In the morning, rinse and drain the seeds. To allow a maximum surface for sprouting, the jar is best laid on its side, propped up slightly so any excess water can drain away through the muslin. Most seeds need a temperature of about 15C to sprout fastest, so room temperature is fine. Twice a day, it is essential you rinse the sprouts. Fill the jar with water, give everything a good swirl around and then refresh the water. Your seeds should sprout quickly; if they linger more than five days, consider them compost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"de8aa6dc236630ee347d6fafd780ccb3cce2664d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de8aa6dc236630ee347d6fafd780ccb3cce2664d/0_0_3544_5315/667.jpg\" alt=\"Dandelion.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dandelion: pick the youngest leaves for raw salads.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Microgreens can be harvested at between 10 and 21 days, when they are several centimetres high.

No small plant pots? Raid the recycling bin for yoghurt containers and takeaway trays. It\u2019s fine to reuse compost as well, because the seedlings get everything they need from their own stores and the sun. This is the time to use up all those half-opened packets that are out of date. Most of the seeds will no longer be viable, so sow thickly on the surface of the compost, water in and keep damp until germination. A clear plastic bag or propagator lid is ideal for helping the process along.</p> <p>Once the seedlings are large enough to handle, snip them off and use as a garnish.

  "<p>People 60 and older are at far higher risk of getting very sick or dying from the coronavirus. And people 85 and over are even more vulnerable, with a death rate from the virus between 10% and 27%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/01/covid19-coronavirus-have-i-already-had-it\">Have I already had coronavirus? How would I know and what should I do?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dr Mary Tinetti, chief of geriatrics at Yale school of medicine and Yale New Haven hospital, explains what kinds of precautions they \u2013 and the people around them \u2013 must take.</p> <h2><strong>Volunteer efforts are popping up to deliver supplies to older and more vulnerable people. Is that risky?</strong></h2> <p>There really isn\u2019t a right answer to your question. It is between a rock and a hard place. Is it better for people to go out in public and get their groceries or to have them delivered? If they\u2019re in a place where the grocery store delivers then they should have it delivered. The ideal would probably be a single family member who picks up the groceries at a place that is safe and delivers it, perhaps cleaning off the containers.</p> <p>Many people don\u2019t have that option. In that case, they need to rely on volunteer corps. The volunteer should be carefully screened and have daily checks to make sure they are well. And reminded to wash their hands before touching anything.</p> <h2><strong>Should people be visiting their older relatives and community members right now? </strong></h2> <p>The data that we have now suggests that the risk of getting much sicker with the Covid is 60 and older. But it\u2019s even people in their 40s and 50s if they have serious chronic conditions such as lung disease or heart failure.</p> <p>It is such a big trade-off because interacting and being socially engaged is so important to get through this difficult time. But we know from what\u2019s happened in other countries already that the best prevention is the more you social-distance and keep away.</p> <p>There are exceptions, obviously. If a person is very frail and you\u2019re worried they\u2019re not going to live for a long time, then obviously there should be visiting, there should be interaction.</p> <h2><strong>What would you say to people who say:</strong><strong> \u2018Well I don\u2019t have symptoms so it\u2019s safe for me to visit\u2019?</strong></h2> <p> I think we\u2019re probably going to find that for every one person who has symptoms, there\u2019s probably [many more] people who have the infection, who don\u2019t have symptoms. And they are the ones that are infecting everybody else.</p> <h2><strong>What if someone older in your life isn\u2019t taking social distancing seriously?</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s important to know where the behavior was coming from. And so I\u2019ve asked them: \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you doing this?\u201d And if they say: \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a real problem. I think they\u2019re overblowing it,\u201d I think you can reiterate what we\u2019ve known from other countries is that it\u2019s, again, people in their 50s with illnesses and people 60 and older who seem to get it the worst.</p> <p>The other thing I\u2019m hearing from older people if they want to stay connected to younger people is, \u201cOh, I\u2019ve gotta die of something.\u201d My answer to that is, \u201cYes, we all have to die from something.\u201d But the important thing to know here is when older people like yourself do get sick, you may not die right away. It could linger for a long time and be very uncomfortable for you. And it\u2019s taking up the use of things like ventilators and intensive care beds to take care of you because you didn\u2019t comply \u2026 at the expense of what could be one of your young relatives.</p> <h2><strong>What should you do if an older person </strong><strong> needs you to deliver food or medicine or check on them?</strong></h2> <p>Wash your hands, wash your hands, wash your hands. It\u2019s clear that hand-washing and social distance are the two biggest things to do. Wash your hands before you go in the door. Wash the doorknobs as you\u2019re going in and out. Wash the package before you put it down. Lysol it or Clorox it. And if you\u2019re in their living space, stay 6ft away.</p> <h2><strong>Are you worried that the focus on older people could send the inaccurate message that younger people aren\u2019t getting critically ill?</strong></h2> <p>We love simple messages, and unfortunately Covid-19 didn\u2019t get the message that it was supposed to be simple.</p> <p>Young people and older people get Covid. Young people and older people with Covid do get sick and require hospitalization, so it\u2019s a disease of all ages. That being said, most of the younger adults that are sick enough to be in the hospital [or need intensive care] \u2026 are likely to recover.</p>",

Trevor Noah explains how Joe Exotic and Trump are the same</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then, out of nowhere, just when we needed it the most, with most of the American populace newly ordered to stay home, Netflix released Tiger King. What first looked like its latest entry in its the long series of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_Genius_(TV_series)\">impoverished whites</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_Addicted_to_Crystal_Meth\">exploitation documentaries</a> instead turned out not to be a mere seven-hour trifle, a way to pass the time between fist fights over toilet paper in the Walgreens aisle. No, it turned out to be great art. And like much of our great art, it reflects our world back to us, reveals our hidden realities and our shameful foibles. We are the Tiger King. The Tiger King is us.</p> <p>Ostensibly this is the story of Joe \u201cExotic\u201d Schreibvogel, just a simple man with a couple of husbands and hundreds of tigers and other assorted rare animals in a private zoo. His story echoes the classic stories, telling us how power, fame and baby tiger access can warp a once empathetic and kind man into a paranoid and reckless ruler. But it could also be read as the story of how we found ourselves where we are \u2013 in lockdown during a pandemic, ruled over by megalomaniacs and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/opinion/jared-kushner-coronavirus.html\">amateurs</a>, unable to tell truth from fiction. It shows us how we got here.</p> <p>This bringing of the wild into our domestic spaces is, after all, what got us sick. Tiger King illuminates this. I don\u2019t just mean how wild animals are exploited and abused for the egotistical and sexual gratification of their \u201cowners\u201d \u2013 although feel free to read Tiger King as an allegory, with all of the men on the show using baby tigers to draw potential sexual partners as stand-ins for the way that the slaughter of animals like bears for their supposed <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/03/weekend-aphrodisiac-bear/273650/\">aphrodisiac properties</a> in so-called \u201cwet markets\u201d created the conditions for virus transmission from animal to human. You don\u2019t even have to be borderline racist about it, you can compare the conditions in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu#cite_ref-FOOTNOTECrosby2003_21-1\">Kansas livestock pens</a> that created the Spanish flu virus of 1918 with the too-small cages Joe kept his chimpanzees in for 10 years.</p> <p>It allows us to see how we have a society that prioritizes freedom above all else, no matter the damage done. From the men arguing they should be allowed to keep wild animals in unnatural settings despite the potential suffering of the animals and loss of limb and life of the keepers, to the preachers who stubbornly refuse to stop holding services despite the social distancing orders, because if you give up going to church to avoid an illness that causes you to drown in your own fluids, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pastorlocke/status/1244776977673916418\">we might as well be living in Russia</a>.</p> <p>But Tiger King\u2019s most powerful message might be about the people who have been elected and selected to keep us safe, to give wise counsel, and steer us through this crisis. Most true-crime entertainment sings love songs to cops, giving us smart, eager detectives who just can\u2019t get that one unsolved case out of their heads, who will tirelessly pursue truth and justice, no matter how long it takes. These men, and it\u2019s almost always men, will be haggard and aged, so we can imagine all of their hard work and sleepless nights.</p> <p>Instead, Tiger King shows authorities for how they actually often are: fumbling, inadequate and drunk on power. The detective faced with finding Carole Baskin\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/tiger-king-carole-baskin-don-lewis.html\">missing husband</a>: well, gee, I don\u2019t know, maybe one day we\u2019ll find something or someone will say something. The prosecutor who may well be relying on the testimony of a liar to ensure the conviction of a defendant: well, golly, he sure seemed credible to me, seeing as how he said exactly the thing I wanted him to say.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What we watched as entertainment we will soon watch as horrifying news programs</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I switched between watching Tiger King and the news and it\u2019s like there\u2019s no difference between the two. The lead member of the White House coronavirus taskforce: well, shucks, I sure do think America is doing the best job in the world with testing and treating coronavirus patients. The president who for months insisted the coronavirus was a minor problem until it had spread to the largest number of cases in the world: well, gee whiz, America is the best, we\u2019re doing the best, we\u2019re going to be fine, and hey, why don\u2019t I put my son-in-law with no experience in anything in charge of this. And meanwhile the numbers of diagnosed patients and fatalities just keep spiraling upward.</p> <p>The pathologies on display in Tiger King \u2013 the drive for power, the constant need for more, the willingness to remove any obstacle to what you desire, even by using violence \u2013 underlie a society that can\u2019t take care of its sick or poor, that <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/03/9618076/will-the-big-cat-public-safety-act-pass-into-law\">can\u2019t pass regulations</a> that would reduce real suffering. It\u2019s all on show. And what we watched as entertainment we will soon watch as horrifying news programs, as the deaths from the virus increase and overwhelm our broken healthcare system.</p> <p>But it is perhaps the words of strip club owner, federal informant and alleged con artist James Garretson which resonate the loudest with our moment. \u201cEverybody wants to be the biggest.

  "<p>Will the coronavirus change the way we spend, shop and invest our money, long after the virus is history? Will we abandon city centre offices, with many more permanently working from home? Or will we return to all our past practices once this grim episode is over?</p> <p>Guardian Money asked experts in finance, the workplace, property, food and the environment to set out what they think will emerge in the medium term.</p> <h2><strong>Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary, TUC</strong></h2> <p><em>\u2018We can\u2019t go back to business as usual\u2019</em></p> <p>Right now the priority has to be fighting Covid-19. But we also have to prepare for the coming recession, and the impact it will have on working families\u2019 jobs and living standards.</p> <p>One thing is clear: even once we\u2019re through this crisis, we can\u2019t go back to business as usual.</p> <p>Individualism, nationalism and free market economics couldn\u2019t surmount this crisis. Instead, in an emergency, it was common purpose, collectivism and social partnership that stepped up.</p> <p>We\u2019ve seen what we can achieve working together and thinking differently \u2013 people staying at home to protect our NHS, businesses and unions working together to keep people in their jobs, manufacturers switching production to life-saving ventilators, neighbours all over the country shopping for older people nearby.</p> <p>We\u2019ve been reminded of how much we all depend on the labour of ordinary working people to keep our homes and our country running. It\u2019s not right that many of the workers we have needed the most \u2013 carers, shop workers, cleaners, warehouse staff, delivery drivers \u2013 still get paid the least.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9964de3c3882b44dba1518d13d8a930614266797\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9964de3c3882b44dba1518d13d8a930614266797/14_26_5112_3067/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A supermarket delivers to a house during the coronavirus lockdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A supermarket delivers to a house during the coronavirus lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Finnbarr Webster/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During this crisis a Conservative government found it necessary to bring unions and civil society into the room \u2013 as well as business. The solutions we found together aren\u2019t perfect but they show the potential of a different kind of leadership.</p> <p>After this immediate crisis is done, we need to remember what worked in an emergency \u2013 and use it to bring in a new era of sharing power, responsibility and wealth. After all, in the aftermath of the pandemic, we still need to tackle the challenges of inequality, new technology and the climate crisis, too.</p> <p>That means finding a new role for collective bargaining, to protect livelihoods. It means making sure businesses aren\u2019t just profit-making machines but instead have a social purpose.</p> <p>We can\u2019t repeat what happened after the 2008 crash, when big banks and corporations bounced back but working families paid the price. Real wages only returned to their pre-2008 levels in early 2020 \u2013 immediately before coronavirus hit.</p> <p>While right now many of us simply want things to return to normal, the reality is that some things have changed for good. We know the years ahead won\u2019t be easy.</p> <p>But together we can build a new normal, where we all get our fair share and can provide a decent life for ourselves and our families. Collectivism is for life \u2013 not just in a crisis.</p> <h2><strong>Terry Smith, manager of </strong><strong>the \u00a317bn Fundsmith Equity</strong></h2> <p><em>\u2018No one seems able to sell everything and buy back at the bottom\u2019</em></p> <p>What should investors do in the current market panic? Four strategies spring to mind:</p> <p>1. Sell everything and buy back at the bottom</p> <p>2. Try to buy those companies which will benefit from the crisis</p> <p>3. Buy so-called \u201cvalue\u201d stocks which have been hit hard in the market fall</p> <p>4. Just own high-quality companies and try to ignore events</p> <p>The first strategy suffers from one major drawback \u2013 no one seems to be able to do it. It takes more foresight, mental flexibility and emotional stability than most investors possess to be able to foresee a disaster, sell and then buy back in when things look at their bleakest.</p> <p>Trying to pick companies that might profit from the crisis is maybe easier. Think disinfectant manufacturers like Reckitt Benckiser and mask manufacturers like 3M. But the crisis will be temporary and they have other businesses, some of which were already challenged before the economy turned down.</p> <p>Buying so-called \u201cvalue\u201d stocks has fared very badly and has not shown any improvement so far in this market downturn. The Fundsmith Equity Fund year to date has outperformed the Benchmark MSCI World Index by nearly 8% but it outperformed the MSCI World Value Index by over 14%.</p> <p>I have never been a believer in the philosophy that so-called \u201cvalue\u201d investments would perform well in an economic and market downturn. Shares that are lowly-rated are so mostly for good reasons. Their businesses are mostly heavily cyclical, highly leveraged, they have poor returns on capital and/or they face other structural or management issues. It\u2019s not a combination likely to protect your investment in difficult times.</p> <p>Which brings me to the final strategy. I haven\u2019t a clue what will emerge from the current apocalyptic state. Rather like some of the companies I most admire, I try to spend very little time considering matters that I can neither predict nor control and focus instead on those that I can affect. I just try to own good businesses.</p> <h2><strong>Phil Spencer, TV property expert</strong></h2> <p><em>\u2018The market is likely to take a fair while to recover\u2019</em></p> <p>It seems that for all intents and purposes the UK housing market is shut. It is temporarily closed for business. Nothing more, nothing less. It has not crashed, slumped or even slowed down. It has just stopped.</p> <p>Aside from physical viewings not being allowed to take place at the moment, the real crunch point is that surveys and bank valuations cannot take place. Which basically means you can\u2019t raise a mortgage \u2026 or certainly not under even half sensible terms. It doesn\u2019t matter what market you\u2019re dealing in \u2013 whether its wellington boots or bags of popcorn \u2013 for a marketplace to function, people have to be able to trade within it. There has to be liquidity. While the banks are unable to safely lend money, the housing market is unable to function. It\u2019s as simple as that.</p> <p>The primary question in my mind is how long will this situation remain?</p> <p>Working on that assumption \u2013 it begs the question, how comfortable are the banks going to be lending money to individuals whose future income may be uncertain? And then added into that perfect little storm, will be the fact that even when things do get going again, how long will it be before borrowers, valuers or lenders will be able to trust any price or reliable market data? </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9512504c14c77a2d00cb48af9a7c82a8087eea98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9512504c14c77a2d00cb48af9a7c82a8087eea98/335_326_2964_1779/1000..jpg\" alt=\"The UK housing market is shut.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The UK housing market is shut.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This does not necessarily mean a price crash or a fall in underlying property values. But it does mean transaction volumes will dry up for a period of time. To give this some context, in China, property transactions were around zero for the three weeks following movement restrictions and have since (two months later) recovered to 50% of their four-year average.</p> <p>So my expectation is that while the actual pandemic and social lockdown etc may even turn out to be short-lived, the property market itself is likely to take a fair while longer to return to full health. I\u2019m absolutely sure it will get there \u2013 a combination of low interest rates and rising inflation will certainly help \u2013 but it might be a wee while yet. Hold on tight folks!

I think coronavirus is going to change things dramatically. At the very least it will make luddites embrace the internet. Even I\u2019ve shifted to doing internet banking for the first time. There\u2019s still an awful lot of people not on the internet.</p> <p>It was sheer luck that I sold a lot of my shares just before the crash. [Hargreaves sold \u00a3550m in Hargreaves Lansdown shares in early February, when the price was around \u00a317.50 a share compared with around \u00a313 now]. It was the biggest sale by a single private investor in the UK of all time. I\u2019ve had a lot of stick about it. But I started work on it in December \u2013 it was not the sort of thing of thing you can do overnight.</p> <p>When the world comes out of this, more and more people will be converted to the new economy, how everything can be bought online, and how we won\u2019t need the high street. If you are in retail today, you are done for.</p> <p>I\u2019ve put \u00a320m into the Blue Whale Growth fund [Hargreaves co-founded Blue Whale in 2017]. The team there are keener on some of their tech stocks than they have ever been.</p> <p>Some people are saying buy the cyclical stocks that will recover after a recession. But I\u2019m not sure a lot of the cyclical stocks are going to come back in the way they used to.</p> <h2><strong>Jo Whitfield, chief executive, Co-op Food</strong></h2> <p><em>\u2018Budgets will be tighter and the biggest change will be the shift to online\u2019</em></p> <p>It\u2019s easy to see the longer-term picture as one of doom and gloom, and there will be challenges, but there will also be much change for good and a great party to kick things off. Once freed from lockdown, we can expect shoppers to celebrate in some style with family and friends who they haven\u2019t seen for some time. Restaurants and cafes should experience a boom as we go mad for a while on eating out, but home cooking is also becoming a way of life as we face into staying at home, and this shift will continue.</p> <p>Consumers are having to prepare more meals at home and are falling in love with baking and home cooking. Dusting off old family recipes and involving the family more in creating meal occasions. We see this growing as people shop differently to make more meals themselves from scratch. </p> <p>Neighbourliness will also be a big theme post-coronavirus. There is a thriving community spirit as people look after their own and their neighbours. The street party spirit of older generations could well return as we enjoy being free from the confines of our homes but also strengthen new-found friendships. </p> <p>Budgets will be tighter, given the economic fallout from coronavirus, and we will look for value for money. And we are moving to an \u201conly when necessary shopping\u201d mentality. In the future, this little and often approach could help accelerate the move to less frequent big shops and an increase in top-up shopping. Local producers are seeing uplifts in sales and local farm shops and other community stores will benefit beyond coronavirus from a new customer base which will stay loyal.</p> <p>The biggest change will be the shift to online. Demand is outstripping delivery slots but this will see many move into home-delivered or click-and-collect services in the future. </p> <h2><strong>Caroline Lucas, Green party MP</strong></h2> <p><em>\u2018Even Conservative MPs are calling for a universal basic income\u2019</em></p> <p>Coronavirus is changing us as a society, but it\u2019s also revealing who we can truly be. We are seeing people\u2019s roles and jobs afresh . People who yesterday were \u201cunskilled\u201d are now essential workers \u2013 and rightly so. I hope that will lead to a reassessment of jobs and wages, so that in future no one working in an essential role is undervalued or left in poverty.</p> <p>We\u2019re very lucky in Brighton to have a huge range of independent food shops.

Michael Gove asserting on the Marr programme that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to put the lives of the vulnerable ahead of everything else\u201d; Conservative MPs calling for a universal basic income. The coronavirus may turn out to be the locomotive of history which accelerates the transition to a better, fairer society. But we will have to fight to ensure it happens.</p> <h2><strong>Edwin Booth, head of family-owned supermarket chain Booths</strong></h2> <p><em>\u2018A sharing of value will save mankind, greater wealth in fewer hands will not\u2019</em></p> <p>Customers are and will continue to be anxious, seeking reassurance that the food that they buy is safe, healthy and from a trusted source. In the aftermath of Brexit, there is an opportunity for the government to collaborate with food industries and farming to create a framework for increased food production throughout the United Kingdom.</p> <p>Consumers are going to be more aware and conscious than ever before. Food retailers will need to understand how they make customers feel, while front-line workers will have more responsibility for running \u201ctheir business\u201d.</p> <p>In my personal purpose there is a line that reads, \u201cThere is no such thing as a dull person\u201d. At Booths I describe empowerment as \u201clegitimising common sense\u201d. After three weeks of facing into Covid-19, this simple sentiment has accelerated our responses. Remote working and the use of modern video technologies has enabled our business to run at a high pace despite there only being a team of some 12 people physically attending our central office.</p> <p>It has not been a smooth ride for those having to maintain a physical presence either in distribution centres, manufacturing areas and the stores. Distancing and safety routines have made many tasks more difficult, and the attitude with which colleagues have carried out their daily tasks has been heart-warming.</p> <p>The future of food retailing will be fast-paced. Overarching everything will be the need for customers to feel loved. Family and friends are going to mean more to all of us, and communities will be rebuilt with a keener awareness of local values. Globalism will not die but should become a way of understanding diversity as opposed to a means by which to direct wealth to the few. A sharing of value will save mankind, greater wealth in fewer hands will not.</p>",

Thousands of migrants remain stuck in Libyan detention centres, where they are subjected to torture and abuse. According to the UNHCR, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on departures by sea from Libya is not yet clear. Certainly, given the absence of NGO rescue boats, attempting to reach Europe from North Africa has become increasingly risky in recent months.</p> <p>Since the beginning of the coronavirus emergency, many charities committed to saving migrants in the central Mediterranean have temporarily abandoned their activities at sea and transferred their resources, including doctors and other health workers, to European hospitals.

  "<p>\u201cI can\u2019t think of a book where there\u2019s a woman born into a working-class background, who in her 70s is living a very comfortable, upper-middle-class sort of life; a woman who married at 19, had a baby at 21, was a policeman\u2019s wife for years, but whose marriage broke up in late middle age and who became very well known for a time. She then met a woman and became very happy with her. There isn\u2019t one!\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/06/jacqueline-wilson-interview\">Former children\u2019s laureate Jacqueline Wilson</a> is rattling through the outline of her own autobiography \u2013 which she has no plans to write, although she did publish a \u201csimplified\u201d memoir for children, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2011/apr/29/jacqueline-wilson-childrens-books-8-12-years\">Jacky Daydream</a></em>, in 2007. While her story \u2013 her rise from \u201cperfectly ordinary\u201d beginnings to become one of the most successful British children\u2019s authors \u2013 is well known, the last chapter may come as surprise to her legion of fans.</p> <p>Despite plans to visit her at home in Sussex, we are talking on the phone (Wilson is 74 and has had serious health problems) before the launch of her <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/love-frankie-9780857535894.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">latest novel, </a><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/love-frankie-9780857535894.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Love Frankie</a></em>, the release of a starry film of her 2012 novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/19/filming-begins-on-jacqueline-wilsons-four-kids-and-it\">Four Children and It,</a> </em>and cinema screenings of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/15/hetty-feather-review-rose-theatre-kingston\">hit stage production of her book</a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/15/hetty-feather-review-rose-theatre-kingston\"> Hetty Feather</a></em> \u2013 \u201c a flurry of exciting things\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Love Frankie is not aimed at young gay teenagers, but all teenagers who have ever worried because they haven\u2019t or have fallen in love</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>With its sprinkling of stars and hearts, <em>Love Frankie</em> (her 111th book, if anyone is still counting), looks like any other teen romance, but the rainbow on the inside cover is a clue that this isn\u2019t the usual boy-meets-girl story. The middle one of three sisters, bookish tomboy Frankie is struggling to deal with her mum\u2019s MS diagnosis, their dad leaving them for \u201chorrible Helen\u201d, and the mean girls at school: so far, so Jacqueline Wilson. Then she falls for Sally, the prettiest, coolest girl in class. (And she just happens to be writing a dystopian story \u201cabout a devastating plague affecting the whole Earth\u201d.)</p> <p>While Wilson \u201cgenerally bristles\u201d at any suggestion that her novels are \u201cfull of issues\u201d, by her own admission, <em>Love Frankie</em> is \u201cjam-packed\u201d with them: a sick mum, separation, stepfamilies, sibling rivalry, bullying, falling in love \u2026 as Wilson says, \u201cit goes on and on\u201d. And then there\u2019s \u201cthe gay issue\u201d, which she has only glancingly approached before.</p> <p>Her books have proved surprisingly controversial over the years, but <em>Love Frankie</em>, into which she has \u201cput her heart and soul\u201d, is perhaps her bravest, at least in a personal sense. \u201cWell, I think so,\u201d she agrees, \u201cbecause I knew perfectly well that it would shine a little light on my own private life.\u201d For 18 years, Wilson has been living \u201cvery happily\u201d with her partner, Trish, a former bookseller, who she met at a party after the breakdown of her marriage in her early 50s. But she doesn\u2019t see this as her \u201ccoming-out novel\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve never really been <em>in </em>any kind of closet,\u201d she says laughing. \u201cIt would be such old news for anybody that has ever known anything much about me. Even the vaguest acquaintance knows perfectly well that we are a couple.\u201d</p> <p>With her silver pixie crop, chunky silver rings (she used to buy one for every novel) and twinkly manner polished by years of public appearances, Wilson is the fairy goth-mother of children\u2019s fiction credited with daring to introduce such non-cheery subjects as depression and divorce into her children\u2019s bedrooms. But with her Blytonesque enthusiasm and fondness for pronouncing everything \u201cdelightful\u201d, Wilson seems the least devilish person you could meet. And despite her risky reputation, she is always at pains to stress that there are no sex or drugs in her fiction \u2013 \u201cnot at all!\u201d \u2013 with <em>Love Frankie</em> no exception (there is a punch bowl and there are a couple of kisses).</p> <p>For years, she received letters and emails from readers asking: \u201cWhy on earth do you never write a book about being gay?\u201d She would reply that because she usually wrote about children with problems, and didn\u2019t see \u201cany problem whatsoever with being gay\u201d, it didn\u2019t leave her with much of a plot \u2013 an answer that wouldn\u2019t satisfy most teenagers struggling with their sexuality. As she admits, \u201cadolescence is such a questioning time\u201d, when even wearing the wrong pair of jeans can make you feel like an outcast. So she set out to write \u201ca truthful, honest book about a girl falling in love with another girl. It\u2019s certainly not aimed at young gay teenagers, it\u2019s aimed at ALL teenagers who have ever worried because they haven\u2019t fallen in love, or they have fallen in love.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a26daa5415d7735f358cdcece242317418b9729f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a26daa5415d7735f358cdcece242317418b9729f/0_141_4337_2604/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jacqueline Wilson with Teddie Malleson-Allen and Billy Jenkins from the film adaptation of Four Kids and It.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jacqueline Wilson with Teddie Malleson-Allen and Billy Jenkins from the film adaptation of <em>Four</em><em> Kids and It.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eamonn M McCormack/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a culture that, as she observes, now almost demands that novelists have firsthand experience of what they write about, she hasn\u2019t felt any obligation to speak out as some sort of mentor. \u201cI don\u2019t think that girls would ever have wanted a grey-haired, wrinkly writer as a role model if they were wanting to feel good about maybe being gay,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI\u2019m sure they could find much more glamorous examples.\u201d<br></p> <p>This is not the first time she has touched on the subject: her 2007 novel <em>Kiss</em> is a mirror-image of <em>Love Frankie</em>, in which Sylvie can\u2019t understand why Carl, her best friend and the boy next door, isn\u2019t interested in her, just as boy-next-door Sammy longs to be more than friends with Frankie. (Attentive older readers might also have wondered about Cam, Tracy Beaker\u2019s foster mother in the recent follow-up novel <em>My Mum Tracy Beaker</em>, who finds happiness with Tracy\u2019s teacher Mary, \u201cAnd why not!\u201d Wilson said at the time.) </p> <p>She agrees with the criticisms that children\u2019s books still have a long way to go in reflecting diversity in general. She has always imagined her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/08/jacqueline-wilson-care-leavers-tracy-beaker-aspirational\">best-loved character Tracy Beaker</a> \u201cto be of dual heritage, because I\u2019d never ever mentioned her dad, who is long off the scene\u201d, although for many a millennial she will always be remembered as she was portrayed in the hugely popular 2002 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/14/tracy-beaker-jacqueline-wilson-new-book-care\">CBBC TV series by Dani Harmer</a>. Despite this, she feels publishing has a lot to learn from the increasingly colour-blind casting of television shows, including the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=flucprDltH4\">recent adaptation of </a><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=flucprDltH4\">Katy</a></em>, Wilson\u2019s retelling of Susan Coolidge\u2019s classic <em>What Katy Did</em>, which changed how she thought of her own characters. </p> <p>For the most part, Wilson has \u201cshied away\u201d from writing about being a teenager since her 1997-2002 quartet <em>Girls in Love</em> because adolescence has become an alien universe of selfies, clicks and likes. She doesn\u2019t even have a smartphone and now Frankie\u2019s older sister Zara dreams of being a YouTube sensation. Yet Wilson pulls it off, getting the details spot on, from texting (only your mum signs off \u201cLove Mum\u201d) to clothes (\u201cno one wears a dress!\u201d), insights she credits to \u201cthe little refresher course\u201d in teenage habits she gets with every school visit. Despite these reservations, she decided that falling in love, was \u201csuch an overwhelming\u201d and universal feeling that even social media didn\u2019t matter too much. \u201cI\u2019m a sort of sweet old-fashioned soul,\u201d she confesses. \u201cI\u2019m not into \u2018Who do you fancy?\u2019 or \u2018Are you going to have a quick bunk-up?\u2019 For me it is \u201cWho do you fall in love with?\u201d</p> <p>Growing up, the author, like many of her characters, was always \u201ca bit of an odd one out\u201d. She didn\u2019t have a crush on anyone of either sex: \u201cBut you just never know what is lurking inside you.\u201d As a novelist friend put it: \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t think you are a lesbian, I think you are a Trishian.\u2019 I think that really sums me up.\u201d</p> <p>Trish has been a lifesaver, almost literally, attempting to donate her kidney when Wilson needed a transplant. But it didn\u2019t work out. \u201cIt\u2019s funny we are compatible in every way apart from our blood type.\u201d Then, in what sounds like an adult version of a Wilson plot-line, they took part in an anonymous swapping scheme with another couple: her kidney type was the same as the donor\u2019s and Trish\u2019s was the same as their partner. They had to wait about a year before they got a good match. \u201cIt was so special to us and so private,\u201d she says. Wilson also suffered heart failure in 2008, and so while she can\u2019t manage marathon signing queues these days (one once lasted seven hours), she\u2019s almost as busy as ever.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82f69c74f53649c3ea815a9a3921669f1b2289eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82f69c74f53649c3ea815a9a3921669f1b2289eb/0_195_1847_1109/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dani Harmer played Tracy Beaker in the hugely popular BBC TV series in 2002\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dani Harmer played Tracy Beaker in the hugely popular TV series in 2002.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giles Park/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The only person who was \u201cappalled\u201d at her relationship with Trish was her mother. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t too devastating for me because my mum cordially hated my ex-husband, she didn\u2019t really approve of any of my friends,\u201d Wilson laughs. She describes her mum as \u201can interesting woman\u201d, \u201ca forceful mother who thought she always knew best\u201d, but not a very maternal one. Yet one of the joys of a Wilson novel is the affection with which she captures the intimacy and intensity between mums and daughters. She adores her only daughter Emma, now an academic at Cambridge, who made her swear, when she was about nine, never to put her in any of her novels, a promise she has done her best to keep.</p> <p>Fathers don\u2019t get quite such a good write up and while there are a few good ones in Wilson\u2019s fiction they are undoubtedly outnumbered. \u201cI\u2019ve tried hard,\u201d she says laughing: \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2026 my experience of my own dad and my own ex-husband possibly has some effect. I will remedy this. It is very unfair. I have tried harder, but I just can\u2019t quite get there yet.\u201d Her endings are rarely straightforwardly happy, readers have complained when the parents don\u2019t get back together, and friendship is often rated more highly than romantic love. \u201cI can be a bit mean,\u201d she agrees. \u201cI suppose I\u2019m trying to show that there are different ways of being a happy family.\u201d</p> <p>Although her own badly matched parents stayed together (they wouldn\u2019t have done today, she says) hers was not a happy childhood, something she now sees as an advantage for an aspiring writer. She left home at 17 and the rest has become part of the Jacqueline Wilson legend: the job on Jackie Magazine (which may, or may not, have been named after her: \u201cIt\u2019s a nice story\u201d); the 40 books published in relative anonymity before bolshy Tracy Beaker changed her life. And now her own \u201calternative\u201d happy ending.</p> <p>Today she and Trish are holed up in their house in Sussex. Wilson, who had spent most of her life in Kingston upon Thames, was anxious about moving to the country, but when they discovered the house, with its expansive views and floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, it seemed as if it \u201cwould be especially for us. And so far it has jolly well proved that. It is a delight.\u201d</p> <p>It is also home to her collections. She has a huge library and upstairs \u201ca most-eccentric room\u201d devoted to her collection of toys, including a rocking horse, and dolls. There\u2019s also a life-sized mannequin that she dresses up in different outfits. \u201cI hasten to add that I don\u2019t actually play with them,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI\u2019m not completely dotty!\u201d</p> <p>She was in London last month for a screening of <em>Four Kids and It</em> (released on Sky this weekend), rather surprisingly her first film. Always a childhood favourite, E Nesbit became an influence for the way in which her books were the first \u201cto change the more moral tone of the 19<sup>th</sup> century\u201d (she also bought silver jewellery each time she completed a novel). Updated \u201cwith my sort of children\u201d, Nesbit\u2019s 1902 fantasy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/10/jacqueline-wilson-five-children-and-it-and-me\">Five Children and It</a> is given the full Wilson treatment when a seemingly disastrous first holiday \u2013 for a \u201cjigsaw family\u201d of two divorced parents and their kids \u2013 is rescued by the appearance of a magical, grouchy Psammead (voiced by Michael Caine, \u201cwhich absolutely delights me\u201d) on a Cornish beach, who grants them wishes, from learning to fly to becoming a pop sensation (Cheryl Cole makes an appearance). Baddy Tristan is played \u201cwith immense style\u201d by Russell Brand. And keep your eyes peeled for a silver-haired woman in a book-signing queue as the opening credits roll. A film version of the hit West End production <em>Hetty Feather</em> (adapted by Emma Reeves, who won awards for the Tracy Beaker TV series), her hugely popular Victorian foundling, was also due to be screened in cinemas later this month. </p> <p>To keep to her regime of two books a year, she doesn\u2019t allow herself to get up before she\u2019s written at least 500 words. She has almost finished her next novel, \u201ca nice meaty historical book\u201d, set during the Great Exhibition with \u201cnothing controversial\u201d about it, or at least she doesn\u2019t think so. And despite the scariness of the outside world, she is \u201cperfectly happily settled in my ways and in old age\u201d, she says. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ve just been greedy.

  "<p>\u201cI feel bad about having designed uniforms for the Nazis,\u201d sighs Hugo Boss as he stares into a plate of falafel. \u201cI definitely shouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d It is rare to hear Boss talk about his past so candidly but, over a plant-based lunch in a London health food restaurant, he is coming clean. Sort of. \u201cActually, whilst I\u2019m glad you brought it up, in my defence it wasn\u2019t me. It was the other Hugo Boss.\u201d</p> <p>This is a confusing time for the identity of the Birmingham-born comedian formerly known as Joe Lycett. As we meet during a break in filming for series two of Joe Lycett\u2019s Got Your Back \u2013 his Channel 4 show that\u2019s like a comic take on Watchdog \u2013 it is now one week since he changed his name to Hugo Boss by deed poll. The intention: a stunt to protest against the fashion brand, which has been accused of aggressively pursuing small companies and charities who use the word \u201cBoss\u201d in their name. The execution: using his new name to wind up the couture company in gloriously silly manner.</p> <p>\u201cI will now make a number of statements which I REALLY hope do not get confused with the opinions of @HUGOBOSS,\u201d tweeted the comic. \u201cJust to clarify, these are the statements of Hugo Boss, not of Hugo Boss. Hugo Boss microwaves fish in the office. Hugo Boss always asks: \u2018What percentage are you on?\u2019 before he lets you borrow his charger. Hugo Boss has a smelly bum bum.\u201d</p> <p>But what started as one of the campaigns in the upcoming show has caused all sorts of difficulties. After all, what does he now do with the name of a programme whose first season was called Joe Lycett\u2019s Got Your Back? Completely change the whole thing? Or rename just one episode, risking it being incorrectly billed in the press? \u201cPresumably I\u2019ll have to find a way of changing my name between episodes,\u201d shrugs the comedian. \u201cThe logistics of it are a nightmare.\u201d On top of that, his manager has registered a desire for him to return to his previous name \u201cas soon as possible\u201d and the DVLA has refused to issue him a new driving licence, as it had some concerns about the calligraphy of his new signature. \u201cIt\u2019s a cock and balls, so they said it could be deemed as offensive,\u201d he laughs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2743c92d31cd86fd044319661eda715c84f13d0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2743c92d31cd86fd044319661eda715c84f13d0e/0_100_2927_1756/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Travel Man\u2019s Richard Ayoade and Joe Lycett\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shady characters... Travel Man\u2019s Richard Ayoade with Joe Lycett.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: North One TV/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It has, however, done his profile no harm, generating some of the biggest headlines of Lycett\u2019s \u2013 sorry, Boss\u2019s \u2013 career. This is no mean feat given that he is not short of high-profile gigs: his easy presence and eye for a wry quip has also seen him replace Claudia Winkleman as host of BBC\u2019s The Great British Sewing Bee. And he has taken over from Richard Ayoade as the anchor of Channel 4\u2019s Travel Man. As well as filming season two of his consumer-affairs show. \u201cThings are very busy,\u201d he sighs in mock exasperation.</p> <p>But the thing that The Comedian Formerly Known As Joe Lycett is primarily known for is a flair for daft schemes that pit him against institutions. In 2015, he went viral after an 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown appearance in which he recounted a battle with York Council over a parking ticket. Nearly 4 million YouTube users to date have viewed his account of how he successfully evaded the fine by badly Photoshopping the words \u201cthe moon\u201d on to a photo of his car and claiming that he was parked in outer space at the time of the offence.</p> <p>Last year, he made headlines by getting the terrifically named Lord Mayor of Birmingham, Yvonne Mosquito, to come to his house and officially open his kitchen extension. And, in the early days of his career, he took Jim Davidson to task after he heard him use a racist term for a Chinese person during a set while they were sharing a bill. \u201cNext time we shared a bill, he got to that bit, turned to look at me \u2026 and didn\u2019t say it. I had an amazing moment where I was like: \u201cOh my God, I\u2019ve censored Jim Davidson!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>So it was only a matter of time before his love of campaigning made it to television. Series one of Joe Lycett\u2019s Got Your Back managed to set up hilarious pranks and brilliantly weird celebrity interventions, then team them with astonishing revelations into the poor practices of big companies. Uber Eats had to improve its policy concerning eateries\u2019 food hygiene after Boss n\u00e9 Lycett successfully set up a dirty skip as a restaurant on the app. When a viewer complained they had lost \u00a38,000 to a scammer who had somehow got access to intimate details of their NatWest account, the comedian flashmobbed its parent company RBS until it refunded the money. It is a format that manages to be funny while also punching up at the establishment, even if it has caused headaches for Channel 4\u2019s lawyers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91eae23892814049e07202c3aae1b0029bf697e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91eae23892814049e07202c3aae1b0029bf697e0/0_333_4260_2557/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Lycett at Bristol Old Vic in 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gold, standard...

There are loads of things I want to do that they have to stop me from [doing]. Last series, I wanted to steal a car to show how easy it is to nick new ones that don\u2019t have physical keys. And they went: \u2018No, we can\u2019t do that because that\u2019s just committing crime.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Traversing this legal minefield seems to have paid off, though. Joe Lycett\u2019s Got Your Back has captured the public\u2019s imagination to the point where they now approach him in the street asking for help with weirdly specific problems. (\u201cThings like: \u2018The lip of the kettle I bought doesn\u2019t work properly, what can I do?\u2019\u201d). There is something genuinely impressive about his show\u2019s commitment to taking companies to task. Lycett insists that they are obsessive about \u201cjournalistic rigour\u201d in pursuing corporations over their poor practices. It is hard to imagine this will not still feel relevant while the nation is on lockdown: even in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak, some of the stories to really capture public attention are tales of corporate wrongdoing.</p> <p>Twitter is awash with people railing against Mike Ashley\u2019s suggestion that the nation cannot function without knock-off leggings. The employment practices of Wetherspoons owner Tim Martin are all over the #COVIDIOTS hashtag. And the internet cannot stop pointing out that the wage bill of Virgin Atlantic staff is the kind of money Richard Branson accidentally drops between sofa cushions \u2013 so his request for them to take unpaid leave seems, well, a bit rich.</p> <p>So, if anything, coronavirus might have made this show even more urgent. There is a quip that really sticks in the mind in the days after our interview, one that was made weeks before the full devastation that Covid-19 might make to society became clear but that has nonetheless proven eerily prescient.</p> <p>\u201cI did say half-jokingly when we launched that I wanted to destroy capitalism with this programme.

  "<p>\u2018I want to reassure people,\u201d I announced grandly on Instagram the other day, \u201cthat it\u2019s easier to change behaviour than you think.\u201d With anxious friends facing a massive change of life in the face of coronavirus, I wanted to spread some calm.</p> <p>The reason I\u2019d started dispensing \u201cwisdom\u201d like some nautical soothsayer was that I gave up a much-loved job at the Guardian three years ago to pursue a simpler life on my tiny sailboat. I ended up crossing the Channel to France, sailing down the Atlantic coast to Portugal, into the Mediterranean, through Spain and Italy to Greece. It\u2019s the slowest life imaginable, travelling at walking pace, completely immersed in nature. I sleep freely in secluded bays, by white beaches, fish and octopus swimming below me. I\u2019ve sailed with dolphins and whales, woken to horses galloping on deserted beaches in southern Italy, and anchored by castles and cathedral-like cliffs. It is magical and it is nourishing.</p> <p> The downside is that I have few home comforts (no fridge in 40C heat is challenging), very little money, and I spend a lot of time alone - sometimes at sea for weeks. I have become my own living proof that you need very little to be extremely happy.</p> <p>Sailors, I thought, are uniquely placed to weather this storm. In that spirit, I sat down to prescribe advice on how to cope with isolation, feeling calm and strong about my decision to sit out this pandemic in Greece. I had been writing for just five minutes when the expected lockdown was announced. With relatively few cases reported, Greece is acting fast \u2013 its fragile economy and healthcare systems will be hit hard. Ten minutes later I was sobbing. I called my friend Cat. \u201cI\u2019ve been expecting this,\u201d she said, in the tone of someone who really knows you. Next, I drank a whole bottle of wine while scrolling through my laptop, crying at the kindness of people far away. Not the font of wisdom I\u2019d hoped to be.</p> <p>But I was right \u2013 we humans are incredibly resourceful and we do adapt. Fear and its symptoms \u2013 panic and anxiety \u2013 are normal responses to danger and uncertainty. In my travels, fear has kept me safe and I\u2019ve learned to rely on gut instinct \u2013 acting quickly to change plans when ominous clouds signal an oncoming storm, or staying alert through hours of fatigue in thick fog off Spain\u2019s rocky Galician coast.</p> <p>The fear beforehand is always the worst bit \u2013 once we\u2019re in crisis, we cope, recover and learn. Those who have experienced grief will remember this feeling of waking up already in the knowledge that something big is wrong. But pay attention \u2013 this is an extraordinary time. Normality is suspended; life has slowed. We are alert. We see clearly what\u2019s important and we disregard irrelevance. There is much to despair over, but we will also surprise ourselves at what we can face, with grace, courage, humour \u2013 with each other.</p> <p>I\u2019ve had my most memorable times in splendid isolation, spending days in childlike wonder exploring Cala Magraner in Mallorca, my only company wheeling gulls and goats climbing vertiginous cliffs. But not all isolation is welcome \u2013 or chosen \u2013 and even solo sailors are social creatures. After too long alone last winter, I sailed to the Sardinian city of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/aug/02/holiday-guide-sardinias-best-beaches-restaurants-hotels\">Olbia</a> and turned to that old-school travel platform <a href=\"https://www.couchsurfing.com/\">Couchsurfer</a>, effectively asking people to be my friend. \u201cI don\u2019t need a bed,\u201d I messaged strangers, \u201cbut fancy a coffee?\u201d I made amazing friends \u2013 and learned a lesson in setting pride aside to admit you\u2019re lonely.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba88211dd64c02864ffce69fc0329b40f83f3178\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba88211dd64c02864ffce69fc0329b40f83f3178/0_82_4538_2724/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kalamata, before the curfew.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kalamata, before the curfew.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cat Vinton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However independent you are, emotional support is vital when you\u2019re far from loved ones. I\u2019m now better at getting that support \u2013 creating WhatsApp groups to check in with friends, share the positives, talk through the scarier stuff. If you reach out, there will always be someone to pick you up when your inevitable meltdown comes. And you will do the same for them. During my recent panic, friends simply reminded me that it\u2019s OK to feel bad. I\u2019m calling my dad daily. He\u2019s strong, positive, brilliant. But he\u2019s 81, so I listen to his phone ringing out, my internal monologue screaming \u201cWHERE IS HE?\u201d before he finally picks up: \u201cI was in the garden. Not dead.\u201d</p> <p>Sailors are good at connecting fast and helping each other because we know what it is to be in trouble at sea. Our shared lifestyle means we\u2019re used to being friendly without crowding each other\u2019s limited space. When I seek shelter from storms, I look for the safest place and hope there are other boats \u2013 not too many, and not close enough to collide \u2013 for the comfort of similar-minded people nearby. Storms at anchor are marked by small gestures from others \u2013 the guy in Falmouth who raised a glass from his cockpit as I waved at him in a howling gale; the time on the island of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jul/31/aeolian-islands-cookery-holidays-jeremy-head\">Vulcano </a>, north of Sicily, when a neighbour, sensing my anxiety as we veered in 60mph winds, messaged approval of my anchor\u2019s set, unspoken reassurance that I wouldn\u2019t drag off to sea. Right now I\u2019m finding joy in the cheerful whistling of my friendly Dutch neighbour and the eggs from his happy hens that a French sailing friend left. There is enormous comfort from the smallest human contact. Never underestimate it.</p> <p>The challenge of isolation in bad weather is boredom, particularly when your inside space is less than six square metres. But overriding that is the relief that you\u2019re safe. Living at sea, you take risk seriously (a neighbour in Portugal was lost overboard in high winds). Should you forget this, popping your head out of the hatch is can remind you that boredom is a welcome problem.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m turning to nourishing things that can\u2019t fail \u2013 cloudspotting, books, writing, growing herbs</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It never fails to surprise me how quiet it is inside when I return from the chaos of wind screeching and thunder cracking. You learn to appreciate your home even more making it cosy \u2013 being grateful for its sanctuary when there\u2019s a threat outside. You are aware of how precious life is on a regular basis.</p> <p>Simple daily rhythms bring enormous comfort. During 10 days of storm in Villasimius, Sardinia, Radio 4\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bggw4z\">Book at Bedtime</a> happened to be Jaws. Perfect! There\u2019s the day\u2019s first cup of tea; appreciating the light at sunset; waiting for the plough to appear in the sky; a good dinner. I find cooking therapeutic. But when the boat is leaping about in a storm, and your home is liable to fling kitchen knives at your head, it\u2019s best, I\u2019ve learned, to stick to store-cupboard soups and stews.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4730cf259d39d89c4bec035be7cee6d37d5f93e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4730cf259d39d89c4bec035be7cee6d37d5f93e/0_331_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Susan Smillie on boat cooking\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I started making flatbreads in a frying pan.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cat Vinton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This won\u2019t be popular advice, or easy, but try to limit internet use. Technical things can go wrong. (For the same reason, I never totally rely on my engine at sea, because bitter experience has taught me it will cut out just as I\u2019m pushed towards some hazard: in Brittany\u2019s notorious Chenal du Four, and again while racing an oncoming storm to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/jun/30/elba-island-italy-emylia-hall-tuscan-archipelago\">Elba</a>\u2019s safe harbour in the Tuscan archipelago). Too much screen time is bad for us anyway, and if we collectively crash the internet through overuse or become vulnerable to viruses (not that one), we are going to be bereft. A reliance on solar power and a cap on data means I use it sparingly \u2013 brilliant journalism to inform, social media to connect, music to lift my spirits, but increasingly I\u2019m turning to nourishing things that can\u2019t fail \u2013 books, cloudspotting, writing, growing herbs. And exercise \u2013 if I can manage some stretching positions in the 2x1 metres of flat space I have, anyone can. It occurred to me yesterday that I could use a mooring line to do some skipping on the harbour wall here at Pylos. In theory. I\u2019m wondering, too, whether a swim around the boat breaks the lockdown. Think I\u2019ll risk it.</p> <p>When your world slows down, food becomes a huge part of your day. And as shopping trips are limited, it\u2019s important to choose fresh stuff that lasts. I\u2019ve learned what keeps best without a fridge \u2013 cabbage, aubergines, courgettes, yoghurt, eggs (turn them regularly) \u2013 and don\u2019t waste a thing (I avoid carrots and broccoli as they deteriorate surprisingly quickly). I make sure I have a breakfast I love \u2013 pancakes or porridge with fruit compote. Toast (currently running low on Marmite, sob!). As favourite things become difficult to get, I adapt. In Italy I missed Greek yoghurt, then realised how simple it is to make. Likewise butter.</p> <p>Finding myself with a load of fish in the little fishing village of Culatra, in Portugal, I learned to fillet and salt them \u2013 new skills, and protein for weeks. At sea 20 nautical miles from the nearest shop in Menorca and craving bread, I started making flatbreads in a frying pan. I\u2019m currently wondering if I could somehow bake a rudimentary loaf in my lidded barbecue (my first Christmas on board, it roasted a whole chicken and potatoes). I\u2019m also pondering either a barbecue or frying-pan cake. It must be possible, right? If there\u2019s ever been a time for experimentation, it is now. Play with food, have fun with it \u2013 but don\u2019t waste it, obviously.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is extraordinarily satisfying to break an addiction to consumption \u2013 I keep a geeky diary of how little I spend</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Things will be tight for many of us newly without income. Without trivialising the seriousness of this, I can at least report that it is extraordinarily satisfying to reduce spending, to break addiction to consumption. I keep a geeky diary of how little I spend day to day (\u00a360 a week on average): writing it down brings more pleasure than spending it. And there is now time to fix things. Repairing rather than replacing is so rewarding \u2013 working with a small budget forces us to be greener and I feel happier as a result. I\u2019ve never been practical (understatement \u2013 I once used a rag to replace a mislaid oil cap in my car and seized the engine), so learning to service my boat engine has been surprisingly satisfying. The pleasure I got from rowing to an empty little cove in Pylos harbour the other day, after spending three days fixing my dinghy, was a high. I think all proper sailors have repaired their toilet. Once you\u2019ve done that, you can tackle anything. Coping in storms and fixing things are two of the things that have amazed me about myself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"238e23fc7503fb8c570a0388f01b88cda88a2e6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/238e23fc7503fb8c570a0388f01b88cda88a2e6b/0_319_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Susan Smillie fixing her boat sail\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There is now time to fix things.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cat Vinton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The strangest thing for sailors, so used to freedom, is to be trapped \u2013 boats shouldn\u2019t be in a harbour in good weather, and we itch to leave. The sacrifice of living in a small space and the effort of maintaining this lifestyle are the price we pay for that freedom. Now that freedom is curtailed \u2013 but it must be. We have the reserves to adapt and find happiness. I\u2019m focusing on the beauty of the natural world immediately around me: the birds that fly around the harbour at sunset, the fish nibbling the quay, the crabs scuttling below. I\u2019m taking enormous comfort from the fact that whatever else we\u2019ve done to them, other species appear to be largely untouched by this thing. The natural world is getting much-needed respite from our reduction in activity and pollution levels. And most importantly, people are noticing, and sharing joy about that. We are becoming aware that this is a chance for real change, and that is the biggest positive of all. When this is over, so too will be the narrative that we can\u2019t change our systems, our society, ourselves. Let\u2019s use this time wisely \u2013 the planet urgently needs change, and so do we.</p>",
  "<h2>Alone in Alaska</h2> <p><strong>\u2018I opened myself to a world that would continue long after our money-grubbing species was gone\u2019</strong></p> <p>I once lived in isolation. Profound isolation. I was 30, and I had built a cabin 300 miles from the nearest road, deep in the wilderness of the Alaskan interior, 90 miles south of the Arctic Circle. I had always worshipped nature, and after five years of planning I managed to escape the office, or what I used to call \u201ccubicle hell\u201d.</p> <p>I had to cut a mile-long portage through bush and forest up to a beaver lake, where I cleared a site for the cabin amid stands of white spruce, birch and cottonwood trees. While I was building the cabin, I lived in a tent. I laid spruce boughs on the cold ground and a tarp over that, and built a strange bedframe of springy birch. I had a grub box with salt and pepper, coffee and whisky, dried beans, rice, flour, bacon, oil and sugar. I had a spoon for eating, a frying pan and a kettle. And a .22 rifle for hunting.</p> <p>As winter began to tighten, the Yukon river became unnavigable, strewn with ice floes the size of cars, and the little beaver lake began to emit long ululating pings and warbling sounds \u2013 the \u201cice singing\u201d. No bush plane could land on the lake.</p> <p>This was lockdown Alaska-style, and it was the perfect place to lose my mind. I kept sane by imposing a routine of reward and work.</p> <p> I let myself sleep in late only on Sundays. Mealtimes and cooking became a ceremony of wellbeing, and after 5pm each night a large tot of whisky provided the reward. My fire became winter\u2019s fruit to me. I stopped thinking of the outside world and cultivated a joy in little things, and in simplicity.</p> <p>Books allowed me to travel and guided my thoughts. I found unexpected solace in Alexander Solzhenitsyn\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/04/nobelprize.russia2\">The Gulag Archipelago</a>. He\u2019d been confined in Siberia for 11 years \u2026 a year on the same latitude would surely be child\u2019s play in comparison. Also, he was surrounded by people, whereas I was my own jailor, safe within nature \u2013 and with my camp dog, Fuzzy.</p> <p> During my little forays outside I watched nature \u2013 beavers hauled the last of their food supplies to underwater \u201cstick-piles\u201d and a wolf pack settled on Pilot Mountain, their howls rising before being whipped away by the winds barrelling in from Russia. In the very early hours I\u2019d often stare up at the northern lights. I opened myself to the fresh simplicity of a world that would continue long after our money-grubbing species was gone.</p> <p>Later on, when I could travel again, I journeyed seven hours by dogsled to the small town of Galena. Outside the general store an Athabascan woman, learning that I was living alone, laughed: \u201cSounds like you got a good camp \u2013 but without a woman it\u2019s only a half life.\u201d And she was right. Sex or no sex, if you\u2019re lucky enough to be with people, take this time to go on journeys with them, journeys that life and its pressures don\u2019t normally allow. There\u2019s a million miles of wilderness within people, which you may have taken for granted for years.<br><strong>Guy Grieve, author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Call-Wild-My-Escape-Alaska/dp/0340898259\">Call of the Wild: My Escape to Alaska</a></strong></p> <h2>Just me and my spud in the Falklands</h2> <p><strong>\u2018I placed the potato on the kitchen counter.

I was 27, and after a decade of distraction at the hands of friends, family and strangers on Twitter, I sought out the most isolated place I could find: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/jun/04/bleaker-island-falklands-penguins-nell-stevens-bleaker-house-book\">Bleaker Island</a> in the Falklands, a small patch of grass, mud and rock in the south-east corner of the archipelago, facing Antartica. It had a permanent population of two, and in the winter, when I planned to visit, they spent much of their time elsewhere.</p> <p>Bleaker Island was very bleak indeed: horizontal snow, a few freezing farm buildings, the guesthouse in which I rented a room, and a thriving colony of gentoo penguins. I lived there for several weeks, learning how to be alone and trying to write a novel.</p> <p>I had brought all my food with me. Mindful of the baggage limit on the little plane that dropped me off, I\u2019d limited myself to items that were light and calorific: nuts and raisins, instant soups, powdered fibre. I tried to make peace with this diet. I was not there to eat, after all, but to write.</p> <p>About a week into my stay, one of the two permanent residents knocked on my door and held out a potato. She was about to leave the island for a while, she said, and had one spare. The potato was weighty, slightly earthy. It was the opposite of my just-add-water provisions. I carried it back through the empty house like a trophy, and placed it on the kitchen counter. I told myself I\u2019d save it for a really bad day.</p> <p>I developed a routine. About mid-morning, when I was already running out of writing steam and counting the hours until I could reasonably go back to bed, I went to visit the potato. It squatted next to the kettle, reassuring and increasingly wrinkled. It sprouted a tentative tendril, and then another. Every day I asked myself: is today bad enough to warrant a potato? And every day the answer was no, in case the next day turned out to be worse.</p> <p>When I reached the end of my stay on the island, my novel was unfinished and so was the potato. But if it hadn\u2019t been there, I think, every day would have been worse. Now, in this time of enforced isolation, so different from the personal experiment of my sojourn on Bleaker Island, I still seek out comforts I can defer, possibility always more consoling than reality.<br><strong>Nell Stevens, author of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/28/mrs-gaskell-and-me-nell-stevens-review-desire-satire\"> Mrs Gaskell &amp; Me</a></strong></p> <h2>Isolated in Iceland</h2> <p><strong>\u2018Stuck between four walls, </strong><strong>solitude soon became the enemy\u2019</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b2e4cdeaa92b748b7bad5f36d062a845b0db9903\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2e4cdeaa92b748b7bad5f36d062a845b0db9903/0_0_3620_2715/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Phoebe Smith in Iceland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phoebe Smith in Iceland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phoebe Smith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The race was going to be a close finish. The initial leader of the pack was being gained on and, with just centimetres to go to the finish line, the top spot really was anyone\u2019s. I felt myself move to the edge of my seat, rooting desperately for number three to clinch it. But as the drama reached a crescendo, the wind blew hard and a shower of around seven other raindrops splatted on to the glass, merging the three I was following into a small, indistinguishable puddle. It was all over.</p> <p>This was day two of me being stuck, alone, in a hikers\u2019 hut in Iceland, and already I was playing a game of windowpane raindrop races to try and pass the time.</p> <p>After hiking in on the first day, I had planned to climb a nearby summit, overnight, then head back. But as soon as I reached the wooden hut, in thick cloud and heavy rain, I knew that any mountain climbing was out of the question. I only had limited food (water could be sourced from a stream outside), so my first job was to implement a rationing system. This was easy for the first hour, but a few more in I wanted to scoff my entire supply of Mars bars in a single sitting.</p> <p>Being alone is something I usually love \u2013 and that I head outdoors to achieve \u2013 but here, stuck between four walls, solitude soon became the enemy. The only way I could see myself emerging from here in the next however many days with my sanity intact was to organise my waking hours into a schedule.</p> <p>The morning involved an hour\u2019s exercise, garnered from moves I could remember from my zumba class, reorganising my kit, and reading aloud \u2013 which entailed badly acting out parts from half of a climbing book someone had left behind (I vowed to write the other half myself if I was stuck here for a long time).</p> <p>Lunch became all about ceremony: trying to make a dehydrated packet meal look like something from a gourmet restaurant. The afternoon involved chores \u2013 from collecting water to finding something to fix in the hut, or among my kit \u2013 and my daily challenge of finding something to be thankful for: a wildflower on the doorstep, a nearly complete set of cards strewn in a drawer, a forgotten bag of jelly babies found in a rucksack pocket.</p> <p>In short, during isolation, and with the end date unknown, it all came down to the little things. And, if I got really stuck, there was always raindrop racing\u2026<br><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/phoebe-smith\">Phoebe Smith</a>, adventurer, presenter and author</strong></p> <h2>On a vision quest in the Pyrenees</h2> <p><strong>\u2018When a large shadow appeared in the trees, my heart began to hammer\u2019</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"06270b25a3998ca22cbacda1bb636a0def246364\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06270b25a3998ca22cbacda1bb636a0def246364/0_160_4320_2590/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Jini Reddy in the Pyrenees \u2013 the was image taken with an old-fashioned camera and timer as she had no phone with her.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jini Reddy in the Pyrenees \u2013 the was image taken with an old-fashioned camera and timer as she had no phone with her.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jini Reddy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few years ago I spent five days and four nights wild camping alone, high in the Pyrenees. I had my tent, plenty of water and, intentionally, almost no food. I could hear nothing but the tinkling of sheep bells in the valley below, and above I saw nothing but clear blue sky. I wondered if the birds of prey soaring overhead might be eagles.</p> <p>I was on a version of a vision quest \u2013 the traditional rite of passage ceremony practised by many indigenous cultures across the world, including the Native American Lakota and Hopi people. The person on the quest goes into nature for several days to communicate with a sacred, sentient Earth, in search of answers to a big life question, or to mark a transition. The aim is to gain insight, knowledge, strength and self-understanding. He or she sits within a circle of a few feet, and doesn\u2019t move about much. The journey is an inner one.</p> <p>Even an adapted, westernised version of such a ceremony can gift you a new sense of self-reliance, resilience and the ability to be alone and move through fear to strength.</p> <p>It was the height of summer in the Pyrenees. I\u2019d given my phone and watch to the guide who\u2019d walked me up here. When I saw him disappearing down the mountain, I curled up into a ball, and wept out of relief and exhaustion.</p> <p>When the sun went down, I felt scared \u2013 of the darkness and what might be out there. Scared of the unknown, beyond my control. There was no one to turn to for reassurance. Fear is a funny thing, and what I learned that night \u2013 it was always the nights I found challenging \u2013 is that if you sit with your fear for long enough, allow yourself to feel it and don\u2019t push it away, it dissolves.</p> <p>Adjacent to my spot was a dark forest, and the tales I\u2019d heard about who or <em>what</em> lived in the forest made me increasingly anxious. In the end, I forced myself to go and sit in that forest. When a large shadow appeared in the trees, my heart began to hammer. It turned out to be a wild horse. Another fear, faced down.</p> <p>Towards the end of my stay I began to miss people, miss <em>doing </em>things, miss being able to make choices, and I felt a rush of gratitude for the richness of my daily life, which I\u2019d so often taken for granted. So being able to sit with my fears, to know that I can turn to nature when it all gets too much, and remind myself to be thankful for what I do have \u2013 such are the things I draw upon in these difficult times.<br><strong>Jini Reddy, author of <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/wanderland-9781472951939/\">Wanderland</a></strong></p> <h2><strong>One family, one island in the Faroes</strong></h2> <p>\u2018<strong>When we have a conversation, it\u2019s a proper one\u2019</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8ce0ae131ee1a50dfd91023748c70fbba50866b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ce0ae131ee1a50dfd91023748c70fbba50866b3/0_0_2976_2232/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Eva and J\u00f3gvan J\u00f3n \u00far D\u00edmun are on the right.

Normally, the island is served three times a week by a government helicopter service, but currently it comes only when the family request it.</p> <p>The island is just under a square mile in area and Eva and J\u00f3gvan J\u00f3n share their semi-detached farmhouse with her brother Janus and his wife Erla, and between them the two couples have five children. There are 500 sheep, about 20 cattle and numerous chickens, ducks and geese. Until helicopters started being used, the inhabitants of D\u00edmun relied on intermittent sea access, and it was normal in winter to be cut off for months at a time. Eva and Janus are the eighth generation of her family to farm the island.</p> <p>\u201cHere,\u201d says Eva, \u201cI never feel lonely, partly because we are a working farm and we are always busy.

  "<p>At 41 and with three kids, there are precious few vices still available to me, and now there are even fewer. If I crave a big night, I get into bed at 8pm, reach for my laptop and rewatch the whole first series of Channel 4\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/17/jamie-demetriou-on-the-return-of-stath-lets-flats-series-2\" title=\"\">Stath Lets Flats</a>. And if I\u2019m having a proper massive one, I rewatch the second series, too.</p> <p>But even before what is technically known as All This, my vices were decidedly homebound, and not just because I did them <em>in</em> my home, but because they were literally <em>about</em> homes. My wholly unguilty pleasure has long been the magazine Architectural Digest, specifically its tours of celebrity homes. It is no exaggeration to describe these articles as an obsession, because they hit my two weakest spots: the private lives of famous people and eccentric home decor. If you have talked to me at any point over the past five years, you probably thought I was listening; but I was almost certainly thinking about <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/anderson-cooper-trancoso-brazil-vacation-home\" title=\"\">news anchor Anderson Cooper\u2019s wall of devotional oratories</a>, Sharon Stone\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/sharon-stone-los-angeles-home\" title=\"\">fur-covered armchairs</a>, or Kanye West and Kim Kardashian\u2019s all-white mansion. Daily, I cherish <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-home\" title=\"\">the interior shot of the Kardashian-Wests</a> with their four children, all dressed in white, looking less like the inhabitants of a luxury family home and more as if they\u2019ve been sectioned in a secure psychiatric unit.</p> <p>Yet despite this fascination, I rarely see the homes of people I know. Most of my friends have small kids, and the last place any of us want to be on a night off is (alas) our homes, the sitting room strewn with plastic toys, the kitchen filled with lists of things we were supposed to do that day and now probably won\u2019t until June. So we go out, or used to anyway \u2013 to the cinema, the pub and other places it now feels cruel to name. Similarly, my colleagues were generally seen in the office itself or various drinking establishments nearby (shout out to Waitrose wine bar in King\u2019s Cross. Were we ever once so carefree?)</p> <p>Anyway. Now we all socialise by (and I struggle to say this without feeling like Mr Spock explaining something very dull to Captain Kirk) video-conferencing apps such as Zoom and, if you have friends who are younger than 35, Houseparty. Because I am over 35, I prefer the former, because you have more control over who\u2019s bursting through your screen. But the fact that I now have an opinion about video-conferencing apps is as shocking to me as my discovery that I can cope with staying in every night. Like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/a-million-people-livestream-joe-wicks-online-pe-lesson\" title=\"\">Joe Wicks</a>, video-conferencing apps were something I never thought about pre-All This, but are now so entrenched in my daily life they have started to appear in my dreams. So while I know we are living through history, I also know my memories of it are going to consist largely of Zoom (and Wicks). I have regularly scheduled dates with different groups of friends and meetings with colleagues, everyone\u2019s image in its own square, like a remake of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzODEdkypdg\" title=\"\">The Brady Bunch opening credits</a>. I am not ashamed to say that on my last trip to the supermarket before the lockdown I stocked up on mini prosecco bottles, and my evenings now consist of me swigging the fizz while talking at my laptop. Bye-bye, Fomo, ain\u2019t nothing going on outside: the party is happening here.</p> <p>Where once my friends and I would gossip, and my colleagues talk about work, now we look around each other\u2019s homes \u2013 ooh, pineapple sconces!

Under the federal protocol in place from 6 March, it was entirely discretionary as to whether those processes had to be followed. Hazzard says he\u2019s:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>... not blaming the federal government here because it was evolving so fast at the time. As you would recall, this all was moving slowly, between mid-January and the end of January, we only had four people. But Health was still preparing and doing all they needed to do, doing all the work behind the scenes and they took it upon themselves to step up the protocol that they had previously applied for many years to other infectious diseases. So when the 6 March protocol came from the federal government, basically making it discretionary, they [NSW Health] didn\u2019t adopt that. The Health team, the senior practitioner, decided they were going to do an assessment on every ship and that is what they did. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Given the risk assessment they did \u2013 regardless of federal advice they did not have to do an assessment \u2013 the NSW Health staff decided the ship was low risk as only flu was found, and at non-outbreak levels.

One reporter in particular keeps jumping in giving her a grilling and calling on her to resign. It needs to be said that Australia Border Force also had a role to play in this saga \u2013 it\u2019s not all on <strong>NSW Health who were following protocol and assessment processes in place at the time</strong>. Chant says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> If I could just take you back to some of the facts. There was influenza circulating on the cruise ship. And we know that because the point of care test, is pretty accurate and showed it is influenza. So we know that influenza was circulating in that cruise ship, and the majority of patients, over half of the samples that were collected at the time, that the cause of illness was flu. Notwithstanding, it didn\u2019t breach the outbreak level of flu because that would have itself triggered a different response. </p> \n   <p>Can I just assure the public, because I think this is really critical, New South Wales Health has learned lessons and had extensive planning under way to actually disembark people and passengers should we suspect Covid-19 on a cruise ship, or should that have been confirmed. We had always planned to ensure self-isolation for people in the Sydney region, safe transport home through use of health share and other modes of transport and also using hotels for the accommodation of people. If we had known that Covid was on this ship, or it had of been suspected, we would have chosen that way of disembarkation.</p> \n   <p>Having said that, the people who acquired the infection, to the best of our knowledge, got it on the cruise ship. A couple of people may have acquired it earlier on with earlier onset dates and may have acquired it from other means. But certainly, the later ones acquired it on the cruise ship and the reason we suspect that amplified so quickly on the cruise ship was because we know some crew members were actually in the galley area, the food preparation area, when unwell and that would have led to a significant risk of transmission there. </p> \n   <p>So the incubation period of the disease, just to refresh everybody\u2019s memory, is 14 days. We have been following up new cases and linking it to the Ruby Princess for that period because that reflects the fact that they were infected on that time. </p> \n   <p>Be clear, the actions of New South Wales health on the day and the advice of the public health panel was based on the assessment of that information presented to them. They concluded it was a low risk, took the action and tested the results. But we would have got them off in a different way [if the risk assessment had of been high]. As I said, this goes to the fact that the clinicians knew there was activity in influenza. It was low-level influenza.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T00:44:40.202Z\">at 1.44am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e87d3d28f08c35a1d119c35\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T00:26:59.006Z\">1.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A reporter asks NSW chief health officer <strong>Dr Kerry Chant \u2013</strong> who has worked tirelessly since the epidemic began \u2013 why her resignation isn\u2019t on the premier\u2019s desk over NSW Health\u2019s handling of the Ruby Princess.

And I find it disappointing in the strongest way possible that there can be any suggestion that those people are not doing their best. </p> \n   <p>In general terms, can I just say, this city of ours is the gateway to Australia. In normal times we pride ourselves on that. We believe that we actually do lead the way in this country, through Sydney and through New South Wales. But part of that is we have more people coming through our airports and more people coming through our ports than any other state or territory. We have more cruise ships that come through the port of Sydney than any other port in Australia. In a normal course of events, there are about 300 of these cruise ships that come in through the port of Sydney every year.<br></p> \n   <p>The very senior health staff that make the assessments on those cruise ships are actually among the world\u2019s best. There were four, generally, involved in each decision made [about the ships]. Four very senior health staff. They are specialist physicians, doctors with extraordinary training and experience in public health. We have people in that group who make these decisions who are consulting to the World Health Organization, in communicable diseases. When they make decisions, they make decisions the rest of us, if we were one-on-one with that doctor, would be very, very happy to have that advice. </p> \n   <p>I would say to all of you in the public, and actually, it is not so much, I think, the public, there are others who are making comments, but I would say to people who are being critical, know that these frontline staff are sometimes working, as<strong> Dr Kerry Chant</strong> did, she won\u2019t want me to say this, but last Saturday she worked for 31 straight hours before she stood before the media. She hadn\u2019t slept. People don\u2019t do that unless they have extraordinary commitment to all of us. </p> \n   <p><strong>What I would say to the community and to those who are leaping to criticise is, take a step back, and realise that we need everyone of these people, who have worked their hearts out, worked every aspect, every possible thing they could do to keep us safe, and we should be very temperate and careful in any criticism of those people. I think if the average person got some of the criticism that was being thrown at them, they would say, \u2018I am not doing this job any more\u2019. </strong></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T00:37:48.308Z\">at 1.37am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e87d0f08f080bdb9f533f98\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T00:15:33.338Z\">1.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>NSW health minister <strong>Brad Hazzard</strong> is once again having a go at young people for disobeying social distancing measures.

Following the release from the health minister outlined below, <strong>the department of agriculture has said temporary changes to visa arrangements are being made to help farmers get the workforce they need to secure Australia\u2019s food and produce supply during the pandemic</strong>. </p> \n  <p>The changes allow those within the Pacific Labour Scheme, Seasonal Worker Program and working holiday makers to continue to work in agriculture and food processing until the coronavirus crisis has passed.</p> \n  <p>Deputy prime minister <strong>Michael McCormack</strong> said the measure meant supporting businesses, providing job opportunities and securing food supply. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We can\u2019t afford to see fruit rotting on trees and vines and vegetables left unpicked. It is vital our farmers maximise their hard work and economic returns. We are acting to enable seasonal workers to extend their stay and remain lawfully in Australia until they are able to return to their home countries.</p> \n   <p>The agriculture sector relies on an ongoing workforce and we are committed to providing the means for that to continue while ensuring strict health and safety measures are adhered to, including visa holders following self-isolation requirements when they move between regions.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Before moving to other parts of the country, working holiday makers will need to self-isolate for 14 days and register at the <a href=\"http://australia.gov.au/\">Australia.gov.au</a> website. Those who do not comply will face having their visas cancelled. The National Farmers Federation has developed best practice guidance for farmers regarding requirements for the living and working arrangements for farm workers during the Covid-19 outbreak.</p> \n  <p>The key points:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Seasonal Worker Programme and Pacific Labour Scheme workers can extend their stay for up to 12 months to work for approved employers.</strong></li> \n   <li><strong>Approved employers will need to continue to ensure recruitment of Australians first.</strong></li> \n   <li><strong>Working Holiday Makers who work in agriculture or food processing will be exempt from the six month work limitation with the one employer and eligible for a further visa to keep working in these critical sectors if their current visa is due to expire in the next six months.</strong><br></li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-03T21:55:22.152Z\">at 10.55pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e87abf08f08c9eaf0dae33c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-03T21:40:24.110Z\">10.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Health minister announces $1.5m to support clinical management of Covid-19 cases</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Greg Hunt </strong>has just issued a statement saying the<strong> </strong>government is investing <strong>$1.5m into support for clinicians to ensure they are given the best advice on managing Covid-19 patients.</strong></p> \n  <p>The National Covid-19 Clinical Evidence Taskforce will receive the funding from the Medical Research Future Fund to deliver guidelines on the clinical management of patients with suspected or confirmed cases.</p> \n  <p><strong>The Taskforce, which includes a large coalition of peak health professional bodies, will analyse emerging national and international research and data on Covid-19 to provide frontline health care workers with the most up-to-date information and advice</strong>.

  "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lil-nas-x\" title=\"\">Lil Nas X</a> was growing up in the small, conservative community of Lithia Springs outside Atlanta, Georgia, he was sure of two things. One: he wanted to be an entertainer. Two: he would never come out of the closet. Only one of those predictions proved to be true.</p> <p>As a teenager who blasted SoundCloud rappers in his headphones and spent all his free time scrolling through Twitter, Lil Nas X quickly learned that it was easier to blend in than risk being different. He knew people who had come out at high school, and saw the pain, bullying and homophobia they experienced. He told himself he wasn\u2019t cut out for it. So he dressed in his cousin\u2019s hand-me-downs and, when he could afford them, purchased safe, muted clothes from Zara and H&amp;M. He watched fashion shows on his smartphone, but never thought he would be brave or rich enough to wear such explicitly queer outfits.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Everything seemed like a dream or a movie. It was like the world was playing a prank on me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe honest truth is, I planned to die with the secret,\u201d Nas says now of his sexuality. We meet two weeks before the California lockdown, and he digs into the plate of spicy fusilli in front of him, a quick lunch at a West Hollywood restaurant after the Guardian photoshoot and before his afternoon power nap. Hesitant and shy at first, he becomes increasingly playful as our lunch goes on. Today he\u2019s dressed in a matching, traffic cone-orange <a href=\"https://www.heronpreston.com/en/GB\" title=\"\">Heron Preston</a> denim combo \u2013 a contrast to the soft, Edwardian-esque outfits he modelled hours earlier, strutting shirtless in a flower crown while belting out <a href=\"https://youtu.be/pok8H_KF1FA\" title=\"\">Doja Cat\u2019s viral hit Say So</a>.</p> <p>Was that really his plan, I ask, never to be himself? \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that changed when I became Lil Nas X.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2eacb57d0450e2b3f0a017f8b7653b081b0eb13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2eacb57d0450e2b3f0a017f8b7653b081b0eb13/504_536_4894_6258/782.jpg\" alt=\"Lil Nas X wearing a Givenchy suit and jewellery by Chrishabana\" width=\"782\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Suit: Givenchy.

In 12 months, he has gone from \u201cthe black cowboy with the song on TikTok\u201d to a global superstar. He is simultaneously a Gen-Z success story, red carpet fixture, <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8524235/lil-nas-x-old-town-road-longest-number-one-hot-100\" title=\"\">Billboard record holder</a> and, perhaps most surprising to Lil Nas X himself, a queer figurehead.</p> <p>The key to this success has been his track <a href=\"https://youtu.be/r7qovpFAGrQ\" title=\"\">Old Town Road</a>, an infectious blend of hip hop and country, right down to lyrics such as \u201cRidin\u2019 on a tractor/Lean all in my bladder\u201d and \u201cCowboy hat from Gucci/Wrangler on my booty\u201d. The crossover hit was embraced by everyone from Rolling Stone magazine to teens on TikTok, prompting Lil Nas X to quickly release <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/05/lil-nas-x-billy-ray-cyrus-old-town-road-remix-country-enough\" title=\"\">a version featuring country titan Billy Ray Cyrus</a>, known to one generation for his 1992 hit <a href=\"https://youtu.be/byQIPdHMpjc\" title=\"\">Achy Breaky Heart</a>, and another for being Miley\u2019s dad. \u201cEverything seemed like a dream or a movie,\u201d Nas says of his whirlwind 2019, culminating in six Grammy nominations, including best record for Old Town Road and best album for 2019\u2019s 7. \u201cIt was like the world was playing a prank on me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"57347a28419aa89661ce98cb4b330a312ec86312\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57347a28419aa89661ce98cb4b330a312ec86312/0_6_5894_7361/801.jpg\" alt=\"Lil Nas X wearing a gold corset and a necklace\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Corset: <a href=\"http://zanabayne.com/\">Zana Bayne</a>.

He slept on the floor of his sister\u2019s apartment and was about to drop out of college, giving up on the computer science major he half-heartedly pursued at the University of West Georgia. One day, while procrastinating over his course work, he wrote his first song. The track, Shame, saw Nas lean into the rough-edged, macho qualities of the rap styles he grew up listening to: Drake, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/09/lil-uzi-vert-review\" title=\"\">Lil Uzi Vert</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/07/rae-sreummurd-sr3mm-album-review\" title=\"\">Rae Sremmurd</a>. \u201cIt was just me acting really hard,\u201d he admits. \u201cWhich I did a lot of in the beginning. Because it felt like that\u2019s what I had to do.\u201d</p> <p>He took on a straight persona for those early songs, lewdly rapping that he \u201cmight go and fuck ya motha\u201d on the unpolished and unmixed track Nasarati, formerly available on the rapper\u2019s SoundCloud page. Merely mentioning the song makes him cover his face in embarrassment, hiding his high-beam smile, and shaking his head. \u201cYou heard it?\u201d he says when I point out that nothing on the internet ever truly disappears. \u201c<em>Oh</em> <em>goddddd</em>.\u201d</p> <p>He is currently recording his first proper album (he considers 7 to be an EP), and after a year of talking about Old Town Road says he\u2019s tired of answering the same questions. \u201cYou know, \u2018What was it like working with Billy Ray Cyrus?\u2019\u201d he drones, rolling his large, hooded eyes. \u201cIt was great, by the way,\u201d he quickly adds.</p> <p>For better or worse, these questions will not stop any time soon. The song was made in a $20-an-hour studio, on a laptop with a beat found on YouTube (which illegally sampled Nine Inch Nails\u2019 track <a href=\"https://youtu.be/XF_ceFugJjQ\" title=\"\">34 Ghosts IV</a>). Nas had already amassed a 20K following on Twitter, with an account mainly known for memes and jokes. When he posted the song there, his life would change dramatically. \u201cCountry music is evolving,\u201d he wrote, finding a video of a cowboy riding a bull to accompany the song.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e728bcfbb52cb0d9df9d10204b55a11e61e321f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e728bcfbb52cb0d9df9d10204b55a11e61e321f1/89_347_3659_2194/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lil Nas X with Noah Cyrus, Diplo, Billy Ray Cyrus and YoungKio at the Stagecoach festival in California in April 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Noah Cyrus, Diplo, Billy Ray Cyrus and YoungKio at the Stagecoach festival in California in April 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Old Town Road took off on the video-centric TikTok, soundtracking clips of teens shedding their suburban attire for cowboy hats and boots, and switching seamlessly between square dancing and hip hop moves. The genre was dubbed \u201ccountry trap\u201d and quickly charted high on the Billboard Hot Country Songs list. Then Billboard stepped in and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/02/lil-nas-song-removed-from-billboard-not-country-enough\" title=\"\">yanked it off the</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/02/lil-nas-song-removed-from-billboard-not-country-enough\" title=\"\">chart</a>, claiming the track lacked the necessary \u201celements\u201d of the genre, without <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/lil-nas-x-old-town-road-810844/\" title=\"\">specifying what those elements were</a>. Many accused Billboard\u2019s decision of being rooted in racial bias. White artists have long borrowed sounds from black rappers, infusing their music with an \u201curban\u201d edge, with little to no pushback from genre-based music charts. It felt like the epitome of hypocrisy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m trying to \u2013 no, I will build myself up as a superstar, and fashion will be a big part of that</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the outrage that followed Billboard\u2019s decision only helped boost Old Town Road\u2019s popularity. The Billy Ray Cyrus collaboration hit No 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early April 2019, holding that position for 18 more weeks and beating the previous record (held jointly by Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men for <a href=\"https://youtu.be/UXxRyNvTPr8\" title=\"\">One Sweet Day</a>; and Puerto Rican artist Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee and Justin Bieber for <a href=\"https://youtu.be/72UO0v5ESUo\" title=\"\">Despacito</a>).</p> <p>A year later, Nas says he still struggles to understand why Old Town Road prompted the kneejerk reaction from Billboard\u2019s country purists. \u201cI think maybe it leaned too much on the other side for them,\u201d he says, adding that because his earlier music features more traditional rap sounds, they assumed \u201cOh, this is <em>him</em>? Then this is all he\u2019s allowed to do.\u201d</p> <p>The predictable outcome of all this would have been for Lil Nas X to remain a one-hit wonder, enjoying the flash-in-the-pan success of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/kfVsfOSbJY0\" title=\"\">Rebecca Black\u2019s Friday</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0\" title=\"\">P</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0\" title=\"\">sy\u2019s Gangnam Style</a> as the internet moved on.

Meanwhile, the fashion crowd appreciate his bold, gender-bending style; conservatives in the south vibe with his cowboy persona; and LGBTQ+ fans relish the much-needed, intersectional representation he provides.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEP429EA6bM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jEP429EA6bM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Performing Old Town Road at an elementary school</figcaption> </figure>   <p>It was after performing to a crowd of thousands at Glastonbury with Miley Cyrus last summer that, amid increasing speculation about his sexuality, Nas decided to come out, casually, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lilnasx/status/1145470707150860289?lang=en\" title=\"\">in a tweet</a>. \u201cDeadass thought I made it obvious,\u201d he wrote, accompanied by a deluge of rainbow emojis. \u201cThere was nothing really holding me back any more,\u201d he explains today.</p> <p>In coming out, Nas joined a growing cohort of young entertainers challenging the idea that queer rappers cannot experience mainstream success, from Kevin Abstract of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/26/brockhampton-14-boyband-men-colour-rap-sing-gay-pop\" title=\"\">hip hop \u201cboy band\u201d Brockhampton</a>, to the experimental <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tyler-the-creator\" title=\"\">Tyler, the Creator</a>, to the openly bisexual female rapper Doja Cat. Grateful that the announcement hadn\u2019t killed his career, he began pushing the limits with increasingly outlandish red-carpet looks. He wore a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2019/nov/25/glitter-glamour-and-theatrics-at-american-music-awards-in-pictures\" title=\"\">neon-green suit</a>, created by the hip black designer Christopher John Rogers, paired with feminine leopard print gloves to the American Music Awards in November last year. Two months later, he was at the Grammys in a leather, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2020/jan/27/grammy-awards-2020-lizzo-lil-nas-x-billie-eilish-and-more-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Barbie-pink Versace suit</a>, with a harness and see-through mesh T-shirt. As the red carpet looks grew campier, the reactions became more extreme. Pastor Troy, a hardcore rapper, also from Georgia, went on a homophobic rant in response to Nas\u2019s Grammys look, writing on Instagram and Twitter: \u201cWelp I guess I won\u2019t be winning a Grammy\u2026 If this is what I gotta wear. They love to push this shit on our kids!!\u201d Lil Nas X shared the rant with his 4.3 million Twitter followers and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LilNasX/status/1222571894483931136\" title=\"\">wrote in response</a>, \u201cDamn i look good in that pic\u2026\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb02c57b12b33b1c441cccd4967c1a8904d63aba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb02c57b12b33b1c441cccd4967c1a8904d63aba/30_0_3561_4451/800.jpg\" alt=\"Lil Nas X wearing a leather, Barbie-pink Versace suit, with a harness, see-through mesh T-shirt and cowboy hat, holding two awards at the Grammys in January 2020\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In his Versace suit at the Grammys in January 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Granitz/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nas credits his stylist, Hodo Musa (who worked on the Guardian Weekend shoot), for his increasingly eye-catching looks. Yes, he possessed a mild interest in fashion as a teen, he says, but he didn\u2019t have an encyclopaedic knowledge of it. \u201cI\u2019m trying to \u2013 no, I <em>will</em> build myself up as a superstar, and fashion will be a big part of that,\u201d he says.</p> <p>It\u2019s perhaps strange that, unlike musicians from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/apr/06/troye-sivan-youtuber-singer-actor-fashion-queer-pride-laura-snapes\" title=\"\">Troye Sivan</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/frank-ocean\" title=\"\">Frank Ocean</a> (whose <a href=\"https://youtu.be/fYGPcfUqzL0\" title=\"\">track Biking</a> holds a top spot in Nas\u2019s playlist right now), he does not explore his sexuality in his music. \u201cI 100% want to represent the LGBT community,\u201d he says, adding that he also worries about the safety and wellbeing of fans who may grapple with the decision to come out. \u201cI don\u2019t want to encourage them to do something they don\u2019t 100% want to do. Especially in, like, middle school or high school. Because it\u2019s just super hard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s easier for me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not depending on anybody. There\u2019s no one who\u2019s going to kick me out of the house \u2013 nobody to start treating me shitty.\u201d This may not be the case for \u201canother 20-year-old who doesn\u2019t quite have it figured out and still lives with his parents\u201d. What about his own parents? \u201cMy family knows now. But it\u2019s not something that\u2019s ever brought up or we speak about. We\u2019re quiet on it. Nobody\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, you got a boyfriend?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Does he want that question? He tilts his head and thinks long and hard. \u201cIt would have to be something I grew used to hearing. I don\u2019t want it to be something we never talk about. Because what about the kids in my family? I would like it to be a healthy medium between, \u2018Who are you <em>fucking</em>?\u2019 and just not saying anything.\u201d</p> <p>For the record, Nas\u2019s love life remains a mystery, despite him saying, last year, that he was \u201csomewhat\u201d in a relationship. His family \u2013 which includes seven brothers and sisters \u2013 also remains behind the scenes. \u201cI should talk to them more,\u201d is all he will say. He is not in contact with his mother, and hasn\u2019t been for a long time. When pressed on this, he becomes tight-lipped, saying only that, \u201cPeople have to be willing to help themselves first before you can help them.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>My family know I\u2019m gay now. But it\u2019s not something that\u2019s ever brought up or we speak about. We\u2019re quiet on it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Piping hot mozzarella sticks are brought to our table, and he eagerly bites into one as the song Lucid Dreams plays in the background, Nas singing along softly. It\u2019s a track by Juice WRLD, a rapper who also created a massive internet fanbase for himself, before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/08/rapper-juice-wrld-dies-age-21-chicago\" title=\"\">dying of a drug overdose</a> late last year. When the news broke, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LilNasX/status/1203913545127088128\" title=\"\">Nas performed a cover of Lucid Dreams</a> on stage.</p> <p>In many ways, the two young artists are sharply divergent examples of what sudden, internet-born fame can look like. Since the success of Old Town Road, Nas has had to rethink what he shares. For one, he no longer runs the meme accounts on which he mastered the art of posting viral tweets and jokes. He refuses to own up to running @NasMaraj, a Nicki Minaj fan account, despite sleuthing fans and journalists all but confirming he did through analysis of IP addresses and time stamps. When asked about being a Nicki Minaj \u201cbarb\u201d, or superfan, he gives a devilish grin and speaks into the recorder lying on the table, as if delivering a message directly to the internet. \u201cQuiet on that,\u201d he teases. \u201cUm, that\u2019s never happened.\u201d I can\u2019t quite tell what he would be embarrassed about, other than the idea of fanboying for another rapper.</p> <p>But Nas has to be careful of his digital footprint. He learned this lesson the hard way in February when <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LilNasX/status/1226883959180734470\" title=\"\">he tweeted</a> a glamorous red-carpet photo of R&amp;B singer SZA with a line that suggested they were dating. He wrote, \u201cclean for her. cook for her and everything i do is for her. and if she cheats? that is on me!\u201d As with a lot of memes, the joke didn\u2019t stand up to a lot of scrutiny; it was just Nas\u2019s way of heaping praise on SZA. But many took him literally. \u201cOne morning show on YouTube was like, \u2018Lil Nas X says he\u2019s not gay any more!\u2019 And it has a hundred thousand views.\u201d He worries more that when he is being serious, people will think he\u2019s kidding. Case in point: he felt compelled to write \u201cno joking\u201d before asking his Twitter followers how best to provide <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LilNasX/status/1235590156364550144\" title=\"\">help during the coronavirus</a> pandemic.</p> <p>He is even more cautious when it comes to politics. Last year, the first openly gay Democratic presidential nominee, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-buttigieg\" title=\"\">Pete Buttigieg</a>, asked him to appear in a campaign video. Nas turned down the offer. \u201cI\u2019m not too into politics,\u201d he says now. \u201cI don\u2019t know his political history or motives. The only thing I know\u2026 Wasn\u2019t he from the Democratic party?\u201d <em>Yes.</em> \u201cSee. All I know is he\u2019s from the Democratic party and he\u2019s gay. So it\u2019s like\u2026 I don\u2019t want to base my support off, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re gay, I\u2019m going to support you.\u2019\u201d His words are coming faster now. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re gay. But I don\u2019t know everything you\u2019re planning when you\u2019re running the entire country.\u201d He returns to eating his food, retreating back into his calm, subdued demeanour as quickly as he came out of it. \u201cBut, yeah. That was the reason I said no.\u201d</p> <p>Later, Nas tells me that politics depresses him. As a teenager, he closely followed the protests over police brutality and mass shootings. It frustrated and saddened him to see that nothing really changed. \u201cIt got hard to leave the house,\u201d he says. \u201cI guess ever since that, I\u2019ve tried to stay away. Politics gets me very upset.\u201d</p> <p>The more Nas talks, the more it becomes obvious that what he is deeply suspicious of is less politics than the individual Americans delivering it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say I support this one person because they\u2019re doing this one thing. Because I don\u2019t know what else they\u2019re doing, or what they\u2019re going to do.\u201d He says he hasn\u2019t yet registered to vote in this year\u2019s presidential election, but \u201cof course I\u2019m going to vote. I encourage my fans to vote.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07a9541d131730355c5dd2171fd3d01fe141956d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07a9541d131730355c5dd2171fd3d01fe141956d/0_0_5778_6964/830.jpg\" alt=\"Lil Nas X topless with a tulip behind his ear\" width=\"830\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trousers: <a href=\"https://www.heronpreston.com/en/GB\">Heron Preston</a>.

He reads books about Buddhism to \u201cget a better understanding of life and how to handle things\u201d, and says he\u2019s inspired by HBO\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/03/is-euphoria-the-most-shocking-teen-show-ever\" title=\"\">teen drama Euphoria</a>. \u201cI would love to do a version of that somehow,\u201d he says of the boundary-pushing show that features a trans lead, queer relationships and lots of drug use. The songs on his new album will explicitly explore his queer identity, he says; his form of social advocacy will be \u201cthrough my art\u201d.</p> <p> We pay the check. Nas is ready for a power nap. After that, he\u2019s attending a concert by Noah Cyrus, the youngest daughter of Billy Ray.</p> <p>I sense that Lil Nas X is still not done coming out to the world.

The anger is so raw many commentators have dismissed it as a parody, and the Guardian was unable to confirm its authenticity.</p> <p>But Airbnb\u2019s army of 700,000 hosts are distraught at the income they are losing as a result of the company\u2019s generosity to guests. <a href=\"https://www.airbnb.co.uk/d/host-message\">Chesky this week apologised</a> and said the company would spend $250m (\u00a3200m) covering 25% of what hosts would have been paid under their cancellation policies for reservations between 14 March and 31 May.</p> <p>An additional $10m relief fund is being made available to \u201csuper hosts\u201d offering grants of up to $5,000 for \u201chosts who hurt the most\u201d. Airbnb founders will also take no salary for six months, and top executives will have their salaries halved.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough it may not have felt like it, we are partners,\u201d Chesky <a href=\"https://news.airbnb.com/a-letter-to-hosts/\">said in email to hosts</a>. \u201cWhen your business suffers, our business suffers. We know that right now many of you are struggling, and what you need are actions from us to help, not just words.\u201d</p> <p>Airbnb has built up reported cash reserves of $3bn from <a href=\"https://www.airbnb.co.uk/help/article/1857/what-is-the-airbnb-service-fee\">booking fees charged to both guests and hosts</a>. It collected revenues from the fees in excess of $4.8bn last year, according to Reuters. Hosts are charged 3% of every booking, while guests are charged up to 14.2%.</p> <p>The hangover from the coronavirus pandemic is likely to last far longer than 31 May or whenever governments lift movement restrictions. Hosts report empty booking calendars stretching throughout the summer, and research by analysis website AirDNA shows bookings in some cities has fallen by as much as 96%.</p> <p>For hosts who occasionally rent out their spare room in the style of a real bed &amp; breakfast the lost Airbnb income due the coronavirus is a frustration.</p> <p>But, for those who have built up mini (or in some cases not-so-mini) property portfolios that rely on a constant stream of guests churning through Airbnb apartments in Bath, Barcelona or Berlin, the prospect of weeks or months without guests spells financial disaster.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RobCross247/status/1241325290565111808\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">64% rise in rental properties across <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dublin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Dublin</a> in midst of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Covid_19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Covid_19</a> crisis according to property website <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daftmedia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@daftmedia</a>  as landlords start withdrawing their rentals from short-term listing sites like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Airbnb?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Airbnb</a> and are offering them into the market instead.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HousingCrisis?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#HousingCrisis</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CoronaCrisis?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CoronaCrisis</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Wfj56HaNLC\">pic.twitter.com/Wfj56HaNLC</a></p>&mdash; Rob Cross (@RobCross247) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobCross247/status/1241325290565111808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 21, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>It is also a disaster for Chesky, 38, and the large number of Airbnb\u2019s employees who hold stock options. The company was lining up for a stock market flotation this year, which some investors hoped would value the 11-year-old tech giant at up to $42bn \u2013 even though the Wall Street Journal reported the business lost nearly $320m in just the first nine months of last year.</p> <p>In a video presentation on Thursday, Chesky told staff the company had lowered its valuation to $26bn, down from $31bn when it last raised money from investors in September 2017, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/02a8ca9b-1ba9-4e0a-a3d5-084dd93469bb\">according to the Financial Times</a>.</p> <p>Airbnb employees have long been pushing executives to press ahead with an initial public offering (IPO) because stock options granted to seasoned staff start to expire in November 2020.

Unlike other tech firms, like Uber which can do deliveries instead of driving people, it can\u2019t diversify. There\u2019s nothing Airbnb can do to make money.</p> <p>\u201cEverything indicates that Airbnb income around the world has just stopped,\u201d he said. \u201cIt [coronavirus and lockdown] has exposed the Airbnb business model, and it\u2019s going to pull thousands and thousands of people down with it. People [hosts] have gone into it as an absolute business and they\u2019re in a very, very difficult situation.\u201d</p> <p>To try and make some income from their empty properties landlords have flooded the rental market with their Airbnb flats. On Edinburgh\u2019s Princes Street, for example, there are 209 Airbnb listings on a road of just 494 homes. Property portal Rightmove said the number of new rentals coming on to the market in the week the UK lockdown started increased by 45% in London, up 55% in Brighton, 62% in Edinburgh and 78% in Bath. It\u2019s a similar story the world over with a 61% increase in Dublin and 41% in Prague.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Holway said many hosts are reliant on Airbnb income to pay mortgages on not one but several properties, while others \u201crent flats off commercial landlords and then seek to make a profit renting it out on short lets on Airbnb \u2013 that\u2019s not going to happen now\u201d.</p> <p>Sheffield based entrepreneur Alex Milburn claims to have made \u201c\u00a31,000,000 in Airbnb sales in 12 months\u201d and now markets his \u201crent to rent\u201d strategy in <a href=\"https://events.tomheaney.com/R2R-Training?r_done=1\">one-day seminars costing \u00a3997 (plus VAT)</a>.

  "<h2><strong>Music</strong></h2> <p>Back in the music industry\u2019s 1990s boom, when tenner-a-pop CD sales were skyrocketing, going on tour was a good way of shifting more product. After digital piracy burst that bubble in the early 2000s, however, touring became more of a financial necessity, creating a new, lopsided business model only accentuated in recent years by the rise of subscription streaming services. With gigs and festivals essentially banned under new measures to stave off the spread of coronavirus, how can we help artists who can no longer tour?</p> <p>Readers of a certain age will remember the thrill of holding an album in their hands but, guess what? They still make physical product! Vinyl sales are booming, you can still buy CDs and \u2013 in nostalgia news \u2013 cassettes are back, too. If there is nothing that immediately takes your fancy, maybe buy a voucher from an independent online retailer for later. Or, if your favourite act has recently put out a not-at-that-price lavish box set, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/bjork\">Bj\u00f6rk</a>\u2019s Utopia collection featuring 14 handmade bird call flutes, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/depeche-mode\">Depeche Mode</a>\u2019s MODE, in which all 14 of their albums come housed in an elegant black cube, now might be the best time to treat yourself to a day\u2019s worth of B-sides, remixes and forgotten radio sessions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cea8e7fb0d39be80d61bc00068c971c88fea6580\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cea8e7fb0d39be80d61bc00068c971c88fea6580/141_167_847_847/500.jpg\" alt=\"Bjork\u2019s Utopia flutes\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wind power\u2026 Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s Utopia flutes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Record company handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The rise in touring has also meant a rise in merch, most of which is readily available directly from artist\u2019s official websites, and has evolved to include not just T-shirts and caps, but tote bags (lo-fi pop experimentalists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/08/girl-ray-girl-review-moshi-moshi\">Girl Ray</a> have a particularly fetching pink lipstick one), pillows (including a very sweary Cupcakke one), socks adorned with Aussie DJ and producer Flume\u2019s name,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/28/fka-twigs-in-shadow-of-man-robert-pattinson-surgery-new-album-miranda-sawyer\"> FKA twigs</a> shoelaces and \u2013 with time on our hands, why not \u2013 sex toys from the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/marilyn-manson\">Marilyn Manson</a> and Sophie. Or, if your fave act is too cool for an official online shop, try Bandcamp, which only takes 10% for merch and music sales, and doesn\u2019t charge artists to upload their music in the first place (the site has also started waiving its revenue share completely on certain days to boost direct sales for artists).</p> <p>The knock-on effect for future tours and festivals looks grim, but at least with the shows that have already been postponed financial losses can be sutured if people keep hold of their tickets where possible, rather than asking for a refund from promoters that likely don\u2019t have the money any more. If classical music is more your thing, then you could spend a lockdown night at the opera (Opera North\u2019s acclaimed <a href=\"https://www.operanorth.co.uk/the-ring-cycle/\">Ring cycle is on its website</a>), or how about soothing your fears with the <a href=\"https://lso.co.uk/\">London Symphony Orchestra</a>, who are streaming full-length concerts every Sunday and Thursday evening. And, if more acts are going guerrilla and doing online \u201cgigs\u201d \u2013 as pop newcomers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/19/instagram-how-we-feeling-can-livestreaming-replace-cancelled-gigs\">L Devine</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/19/best-livestreamed-gigs-coronavirus-john-legend-chris-martin-code-orange\">Yungblud</a> have done recently \u2013 then let\u2019s all pop a dressing gown on and get involved.

Ordinarily, most make ends meet via a tangled web of teaching gigs, squeezed funding bodies, public projects and, sometimes, selling work. Can art lovers help out?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d8a4af4167b423dca183c8a6816f70f2f09382f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8a4af4167b423dca183c8a6816f70f2f09382f1/0_0_626_1013/618.jpg\" alt=\"Lecture on Nesting by Andy Holden\" width=\"618\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lecture on Nesting by Andy Holden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Max McClure/Spike Island</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Art dealers have sold to those with deep pockets on the strength of Jpegs for a long while. So, if you are a wealthy collector, keep buying. For everyone else, the good news is that there are ways you can support artists and experience new work from the safety of your living room. Artist\u2019s prints, individually made books and other editions are often touted as a collector entry point. Art book publisher Phaidon\u2019s platform <a href=\"https://www.artspace.com/\">Artspace</a> has a bit of everything, with art historical greats for sale alongside newbies.</p> <p>Another way to help protect the system artists depend on is to buy works specially created to support not-for-profit public spaces.

  "<p>Traditionally, the beginning of a new tax year brings changes to taxes, benefits and the cost of some essentials \u2013 and despite the extraordinary conditions we are currently living in, this year is no different.</p> <p>From 6 April we will see changes to junior Isas, national insurance and inheritance tax (IHT), among many adjustments that will affect the pounds in your pocket. There were also a number of price changes that came into effect on Wednesday 1 April, dubbed by some as \u201cnational price hike day\u201d.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what is changing:</p> <p><strong>National </strong><strong>living </strong><strong>wage \u2013 up 6.2%</strong></p> <p>The national living wage for workers aged 25 and over increased by 6.2% to \u00a38.72 an hour from 1 April.

  "<p>Lockdown day 10 in south-east London. A loud rhythmic tweeting is emanating from the cherry plum tree in my back garden. A great tit? Blue tit? I catch a glimpse; too small for a great tit, not as colourful.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know my birdsongs beyond the basics, but I remember a friend imitating calls to coax birds nearer so he could identify them. I have an idea and grab my phone and Google \u201ccoal tit song\u201d. I press play and the rival tweeting produces instant results. Hopping from branch to branch towards me a delightful but agitated coal tit emerges and alights on a branch barely two metres away (I think it knows). Is it angry or amorous? My exhilaration at our proximity turns to doubt and guilt \u2013 I\u2019ve used gadgetry to disrupt the natural world. What was I thinking? The coal tit flies off, its song tinged with irritation.</p> <p>Clearly, playing birdsong on phones can produce results but could this be unethical? I decide to ask Chris Packham through the Facebook page he\u2019s set up, the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/sibirdclub/?fref=mentions&amp;__tn__=K-R\">Self-Isolating Bird Club </a>, which is crewed by thousands of nature enthusiasts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0275c62096b4d9ad6827bcb2d69c30a0a46dccff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0275c62096b4d9ad6827bcb2d69c30a0a46dccff/0_0_817_327/500..jpg\" alt=\"Self-isolating bird club\" width=\"500\" height=\"200\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Packham set up a Facebook page for lockdown birders</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There can be few better online platforms than this in showing how modern, accessible tech has revolutionised local wildlife reporting.

This stuff is no longer the preserve of well resourced global-roaming wildlife film production teams.</p> <p>Packham says of the daily morning live feed, the focal point of the group, which has attracted more than 500,000 viewers daily: \u201cWe\u2019re doing it all on mobile phones and Skype with earpods, and I\u2019ve got a digital microscope. Fabian Harrison, a former RSPB guy, is mixing it in his bedroom in Norwich. It\u2019s Dad\u2019s Army makes TV. It\u2019s very real and in the moment but with no campaigning \u2013 no banging on about shooting or anything. It\u2019s all just joy and enjoying wildlife and getting people to engage.

Amazingly, I\u2019ve never taken the time to sit down and watch birds on my feeders.\u201d</p> <p>Strachan says the appeal of placing cameras in the garden comes from a different place to the motivations of expert birdwatchers: \u201cThe birds become like family. Right now our lives have never been so uncertain. You know the birds are coming to feed every day\u2026 we look for those kind of certainties. The mental health benefits are proven.

He will also share when he\u2019s recently had a call with Vice-President Mike Pence or Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and an influential adviser in the Trump administration.

He has cut deals with Republicans and repeatedly angered progressives. Many Democrats sometimes snicker at the thought of him doing retail politics in early voting states like Iowa, where endless hours of handshakes and diner visits are seen as non-negotiable facts of campaign life.</p> <p>Yet Cuomo\u2019s New York speeches, his personal tangents about how his mother is responding to the pandemic or how frightened he is about his brother, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, having contracted coronavirus, have matched the moment more than any other governor in the nation.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m frightened for my brother. I\u2019m worried about my brother \u2013 as everyone is worried about their humanity and everyone they love,\u201d Cuomo said at his press conference on Wednesday as news of Chris\u2019s infection broke.</p> <p>New York politicians are constantly under the national spotlight. Rudy Giuliani became \u201cAmerica\u2019s mayor\u201d for how he handled the city\u2019s response to the attacks on the World Trade Center. More recently, at the beginning of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary the New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand was a top-tier contender before failing to gain any real traction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3784a49179d5135001bb2c161943c502ddafcb15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3784a49179d5135001bb2c161943c502ddafcb15/0_0_2400_1766/1000..jpg\" alt=\"The Cuomo family, from left to right, Maria, 15, Madeline, 12, Andrew, 19, Margaret, 22, Mario Cuomo, Christopher, 7, and mother Matilda at their home in 1977.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"736\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Cuomo family: from left to right, Maria, 15, Madeline, 12, Andrew, 19, Margaret, 22, father Mario, Christopher, seven, and mother Matilda at their home in 1977.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Argeroplos/Newsday LLC/Newsday RM via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cuomo\u2019s name had been bandied about as a potential candidate for 2020 but he took only a modest look at running for president before deciding against it, according to a Democratic strategist with knowledge of those considerations.</p> <h2>Leftwing opponents</h2> <p>Cuomo has never been a friend of grassroots progressives and he has repeatedly defeated leftwing challengers. When he ran for re-election in 2014, his more liberal primary opponent, Zephyr Teachout, became a national progressive icon for challenging the establishment-aligned Cuomo. In 2018, when Cuomo ran again, he faced another challenge from his left, that time from the former Sex and the City star Cynthia Nixon, who became the darling of liberals hoping to oust the incumbent governor.</p> <p>The common liberal critique of Cuomo is that his administration has been <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2020/03/29/not-for-first-time-a-governor-named-cuomo-casts-an-election-year-shadow-1269546\">rife with corruption</a> and his agenda has been too deferential to centrists and the right.</p> <p>\u201cThe Democratic party has spent the past two decades moving away from its New Deal values and refusing to unequivocally stand up for working people \u2013 and Governor Cuomo embodies this shift to the center,\u201d said Monica Klein, a New York-based progressive Democratic strategist.</p> <p>\u201cThe governor has consistently led New York as a corporate Democrat \u2013 slashing funding for hospitals, public schools and affordable housing instead of raising taxes on the wealthy. If Democrats want to take back the White House, we need to once again become the party for working people \u2013 and leaders like Cuomo are doing the exact opposite,\u201d Klein added.</p> <p>Cuomo is certainly party establishment. </p> <p>He is the son of the former New York governor Mario Cuomo, who memorably <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/21/us/cuomo-says-he-will-not-run-for-president-in-92.html\">decided against</a> running for president at the last moment in 1992. He has known Trump for years. His personal life has been the subject of local and national scrutiny. His first marriage was to Kerry Kennedy, a daughter of the late Robert F Kennedy. Cuomo\u2019s romances and breakups have been documented in the New York and national press (including more recently his <a href=\"https://people.com/politics/andrew-cuomo-sandra-lee-break-up/\">breakup</a> with longtime partner and Food Network star Sandra Lee).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3e196bd2df2ee8ec6433799309d3ea83726be26f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e196bd2df2ee8ec6433799309d3ea83726be26f/0_0_3000_2001/1000..jpg\" alt=\"New York Governor-elect Andrew Cuomo (C) celebrates with his father former New York Governor Mario Cuomo (L) and mother Matilda Cuomo at the Sheraton New York on election night, November 2, 2010 in New York City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New York Governor-elect Andrew Cuomo celebrates with his father Mario Cuomo and mother Matilda Cuomo at the Sheraton New York on 2 November 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Nagle/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These days, Cuomo\u2019s prominence has earned him a new level of attention.

  "<p>Day Whatever: as a regular part of my lockdown routine, I now set aside 30 minutes each day to consider the possibility that I have coronavirus. This involves feeling my forehead with the back of my hand while swallowing repeatedly to see if it hurts or not. They say the virus can cause symptoms so mild you might not even notice you have it. I think: <em>I would notice</em>.</p> <p>Two weeks ago I was looking in horror at TV footage of people streaming into Richmond Park, and thinking: <em>I hope you can\u2019t see my car in that</em>. Yes, I was there. But we didn\u2019t go to the park in order to join a mass infection gathering, and I don\u2019t think anyone else did, either. We went to Richmond Park because it\u2019s huge. It\u2019s unfortunate that thousands of people had the same idea.</p> <p>Since then I have not ventured beyond my front gate. My wife leaves the house early every morning to walk the dog in some undisclosed location, but I don\u2019t go along. She still manages about 10,000 steps a day during the crisis. I do about 250, and that\u2019s only because I forget where I put things.</p> <p>It is a warm afternoon; not a bad day, all in all, for enforced sequestration. With the door of my office shed open, voices occasionally reach me from afar \u2013 from gardens, or from the street out front. It\u2019s partly due to the absence of other noise \u2013 no cars, no construction, no planes, no background school-playground shrieking \u2013 and partly, I think, because everybody is projecting their chat across a two-metre safety gap. I can\u2019t always make out the words, but I know what they\u2019re saying. If I overhear a conversation about something other than the lockdown, I know it\u2019s the Archers leaking from an open window.</p> <p>Every day, at about five, I walk across the garden to the kitchen, where my oldest son is invariably sitting at the table, fist on forehead, gazing into his phone.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d I say. We discuss the stupid thing that Donald Trump just said, and then I show him some viral videos that he has already seen.

When I pull back the cardboard flaps, I see that there is only one bottle left. I pull it out and hold it up.</p> <p>\u201cOh dear,\u201d my wife says.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand how this could happen,\u201d I say. \u201cWe have, like, a six-month supply of pistachios, but we\u2019re out of wine?\u201d</p> <p>But I do know how it happened. My sons don\u2019t normally drink wine, but when the beer ran out, they adapted. When I realised what was going on, I tried to order some emergency wine, but the delivery got cancelled for safety reasons. I am reminded that these are hard times for those of us who enjoy complaining about not very much.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s actually some beer in the car,\u201d my wife says. \u201cBut I was too embarrassed to carry it in.

With stringent social distancing, the Imperial\u2019s 2.2m body bags could be reduced, but by the reckoning even of Trump\u2019s own advisers between 100,000 and 240,000 Americans are still likely to die.</p> \n<p>Trump now has on his watch a public health disaster of devastating proportions. Some <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">245,573 cases</a> have been confirmed across the states, twice the number in Italy, the second-highest nation in the <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">Johns Hopkins league table</a>.</p> \n<p>More than 6,000 people have died and the curve is still rising exponentially. Covid-19 is overwhelming hospitals in New York, New Orleans, Detroit and is hurtling towards the Trump-supporting heartlands.

This is a man who has exhibited a reckless disregard for scientific evidence over climate change; if he could do that, there was always the question of whether he would take seriously any science.\u201d</p> \n<p>Oreskes sees Covid-19 as Trump\u2019s ultimate challenge. Would he put the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans first, or would he dig into the tried-and-tested Republican playbook of showing hostility to science and expertise, reining in government intervention and prioritizing the money markets?</p> \n<p>\u201cThis was a test of whether Trump\u2019s government would act.

By early February, scientists were aware that Covid-19 was both easily transmitted between individuals and had a relatively high fatality rate, especially for older and vulnerable people.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>What we\u2019ve seen is that for the people in power in this country, ideology beats even an imminent threat.</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThat was enough for scientists to know the virus had the potential to spread far and wide and that urgent action was needed,\u201d Konyndyk said.</p> \n<p>At the same time, US intelligence agencies were passing on their own warnings to the White House. According to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/us-intelligence-reports-from-january-and-february-warned-about-a-likely-pandemic/2020/03/20/299d8cda-6ad5-11ea-b5f1-a5a804158597_story.html\">Washington Post</a>, Azar tried several times to sound the alarm but couldn\u2019t get an audience with Trump until 18 January, at which point all the president wanted to talk about was vaping.</p> \n<p>The Post quoted an anonymous US official who said the system was \u201cblinking red\u201d.

What began as an inability to get diagnostic testing going on a mass scale has developed into a sluggish mobilization of the federal government, a stuttering deployment of the Defense Production Act to enlist the firepower of corporations, and a stand-back, almost detached approach that has allowed state governors to take the lead in what Konyndyk called the birth of \u201c50-state anarchy\u201d.</p> \n<p>One of the few proactive measures taken by Trump was to impose a partial travel ban on China and Europe. Scientists told him the move would only delay the advance of Covid-19 in the US, it could never stop it. Again, he didn\u2019t listen.</p> \n<p>\u201cTrump thought in terms of a wall. Put a wall around China and the virus won\u2019t come to the US. He was out of step with all the experts around him,\u201d Topol said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0700fc5ba356fb7970e17f724b75952b4c78a68a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0700fc5ba356fb7970e17f724b75952b4c78a68a/0_0_4000_2667/1000..jpg\" alt=\"EMS personnel outside Emergency Department, St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx on March 28, 2020 in New York City.

His <a href=\"https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca\">first exploration</a> of the subject, a data-driven plea to take the disease seriously posted on Medium in early March, received 40m views.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday he published his <a href=\"https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-out-of-many-one-36b886af37e9\">updated research</a>. It shows America\u2019s curve of confirmed cases rising more steeply than that of any other country in the world.</p> \n<p>Three weeks ago, Pueyo reminds us, the US had <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html\">fewer than 1,000 confirmed cases</a> at a time when Trump was <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-president-bolsonaro-brazil-working-dinner-west-palm-beach-fl/\">telling the world</a>: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not concerned at all.

Florida, under its Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, has echoed Trump\u2019s approach and only imposed a statewide <a href=\"https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/stay-at-home-order-to-begin-in-florida-heres-what-you-can-do-what-will-be-open-and-more\">stay-at-home order</a> on Friday despite having the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-map-of-the-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">sixth-largest tally</a> of confirmed cases in the country.</p> \n<p>Georgia and Mississippi <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-stay-at-home-order.html\">followed suit</a>. Some Republican states including Oklahoma and <a href=\"https://www.wistv.com/2020/04/01/state-representatives-call-gov-mcmaster-issue-stay-at-home-order/\">South Carolina</a> still have no statewide mandatory stay-at-home orders.</p> \n<p>Pueyo points out that Republican voters are additionally vulnerable as they have a higher age profile than Democratic voters. Coronavirus makes no distinctions as to party, but it does prey on the elderly.</p> \n<p>So it is one of the great paradoxes of Trump\u2019s pandemic that he may have put many of his own loyal supporters in mortal peril. As Konyndyk put it: \u201cTrump has endangered his own supporters by sending out a message in contradiction to the science, and they believed him.\u201d</p>",
  "<p> Donald Trump has said his administration is encouraging Americans to wear face masks in public to prevent spreading the coronavirus \u2013 but does not intend to wear one himself, despite his own wife\u2019s advice.</p> \n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued new guidance for people to wear bandannas, t-shirts and other cloth-based coverings in crowded areas, especially in hot spots.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe CDC is advising the use of non-medical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure,\u201d the US president told reporters on Friday. \u201cThis is voluntary.

Covid-19 myths busted</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Yet later on Friday evening, first lady Melania Trump tweeted: \u201cAs the weekend approaches I ask that everyone take social distancing &amp; wearing a mask/face covering seriously.\u201d</p> \n<p>At the daily White House coronavirus task force briefing, Trump was pressed to explain his unwillingness to lead by example and offered a characteristically unconventional reply. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to wear one myself. They say \u2018recommendation\u2019, they recommend it. I\u2019m feeling good,\u201d \u2013 a remark that ignored evidence that many virus carriers do not show symptoms.</p> \n<p>He went on: \u201cI just don\u2019t want to be doing \u2013 somehow sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute Desk, the great Resolute Desk, I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens, I don\u2019t know, somehow I don\u2019t see it for myself. Maybe I\u2019ll change my mind, but this will pass, and hopefully it will pass very quickly.\u201d</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/can-a-face-mask-protect-me-from-coronavirus-covid-19-myths-busted\">guidance on face covering</a> has shifted over time. Previously only the sick or those at high risk of complications from the virus were advised to wear masks. Jerome Adams, the US surgeon general, tweeted at the end of February that people should \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Surgeon_General/status/1233725785283932160\">STOP BUYING MASKS</a>\u201d and said they were not effective in protecting the general public.</p> \n<p>On Friday, Adams admitted the evolution of the guidance on masks \u201chas been confusing to the American people\u201d. He said the original advice was based on the best information available at the time and that the World Health Organization recommended against using them.</p> \n<p>But now, Adams said, it is known that a \u201csignificant portion\u201d of people with the virus lack symptoms and can transmit it before they show symptoms, for example by coughing, sneezing or speaking. \u201cIn light of this new evidence, CDC recommends, and the task force recommends, wearing cloth-based coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. These includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies.\u201d</p> \n<p>At Friday\u2019s briefing, Trump was not accompanied by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/dr-fauci-security-reportedly-expanded-as-infectious-disease-expert-faces-threats\">Anthony Fauci</a>, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or son-in-law Jared Kushner, who spoke at the podium on Thursday about his growing role in the supply chain.</p> \n<p>Kushner, who has no medical qualifications, raised eyebrows by claiming that states should use their own equipment stockpiles first, adding: \u201cThe notion of the federal stockpile was it\u2019s supposed to be our stockpile. It\u2019s not supposed to be states\u2019 stockpiles that they then use.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hours later, the administration suddenly changed the description of the strategic national stockpile on government websites, switching the emphasis from it being the country\u2019s biggest supply for use in a public health emergency to it supplementing state and local supplies. \u201cMany states have products stockpiled, as well,\u201d it now says.</p> \n<p>At the briefing, Trump was challenged by Weijia Jiang, White House correspondent of CBS News, over Kushner\u2019s use of the word \u201cour\u201d. He dismissed it as a \u201cgotcha\u201d question, responding: \u201cIt means the United States of America. And then we take that \u2018our\u2019 and we distribute it to the states. We need it for the government and we need it for the federal government ...</p> \n<p>\u201cAs an example, we have almost 10,000 ventilators and we are ready to rock with those ventilators. We\u2019re gonna bring them to various areas of the country that need them. When he says \u2018our\u2019 he\u2019s talking about our country. He\u2019s talking about the federal government.\u201d</p> \n<p>Increasingly riled as he sought to defend a family member, Trump told Jiang, a woman of colour: \u201cI mean, it\u2019s such a basic, simple question and you try to make it sound so bad. You ought to be ashamed of yourself ... You just asked your question in a very nasty tone.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4fc021bd6808e1e261d7f29bb0365fe6b883c6a2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fc021bd6808e1e261d7f29bb0365fe6b883c6a2/0_0_5265_3408/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Face masks for sale in Los Angeles, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"647\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Face masks for sale in Los Angeles, California.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The tension between federal and state governments in the distribution of ventilators, masks, gloves and other equipment has been a defining feature of the incoherent US response to the virus. Trump reeled off numbers of supplies Washington is sending to states, including 8.1m masks to New York, which has been hardest hit.</p> \n<p>But Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, tweeted on Friday: \u201cWe do not have enough ventilators. Period.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pressed on whether he can assure New Yorkers that they will have a sufficient quantity, Trump said bluntly: \u201cNo. They should\u2019ve had more ventilators at the time. They should\u2019ve had more ventilators, They were totally under-serviced. We are trying to do \u2013 we are doing our best for New York.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou know, we have states, we have a lot of states \u2013 we have territories too \u2013 but we have a lot of states that have to be taken care of.

But Trump took a swipe at his predecessor, Barack Obama, complaining: \u201cThe previous administration, the shelves were empty.\u201d</p> \n<p>As Trump also continues to attack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, and massive job losses leave people uninsured, there are growing concerns over access to health care for millions. But the White House said on Friday it would cover the costs of coronavirus treatment for uninsured people, drawing on $100bn set aside in the emergency rescue package passed by Congress last week.</p> \n<p>Friday\u2019s briefing also produced a very Trumpian moment as he referred to the models projecting the virus\u2019s spread and death toll. He said: \u201cThe models show hundreds of thousands of people are going to die. You know what I want to do? I want to come way under the model. The professionals did the models.

(Kushner had said: \u201cThe notion of the federal stockpile was it\u2019s supposed to be <strong><em>our</em></strong><em> </em>stockpile. It\u2019s not supposed to be states\u2019 stockpiles that they then use.\u201d)<strong><br></strong></p> \n  <p>Trump just gave a very confusing response, saying: \u201cYou know what \u2018our\u2019 means? The United States of America. Our, our, and then we take that \u2018our\u2019 and we distribute it to the states.\u201d </p> \n  <p>The reporter responded: \u201cSo why did he say it\u2019s not supposed to be states\u2019 stockpiles?\u201d</p> \n  <p>Trump: \u201cBecause we need it for the government, we need it for the federal government. To keep for our country because the federal government needs it, too, not just the states. But out of that we choose oftentimes, as an example, we have almost 10,000 ventilators and we are ready to rock...we are going to bring them to various areas of the country that need them. But when he says \u2018our\u2019 he is talking about \u201cour country\u201d he is talking about the federal government. You should be ashamed of yourself...don\u2019t make it sound bad...you just asked your question in a very nasty way.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>In fact, yesterday reporters quickly noted the stockpile is indeed meant as a resource for the states, as noted on the department of health and human services\u2019 website.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhen state, local, tribal, and territorial responders request federal assistance to support their response efforts, the stockpile ensures that the right medicines and supplies get to those who need them most during an emergency,\u201d the website read.</p> \n  <p>But this morning, that language had been <a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Flive%2F2020%2Fapr%2F03%2Fcoronavirus-live-news-us-donald-trump-latest%3Fpage%3Dwith%3Ablock-5e878d5d8f08c35a1d119ae4%23block-5e878d5d8f08c35a1d119ae4\">removed</a> from the HHS website. \u201cThe Strategic National Stockpile\u2019s role is to supplement state and local supplies during public health emergencies,\u201d the website now says. \u201cMany states have products stockpiled, as well.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-03T23:47:40.191Z\">at 12.47am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e87bbc98f08c9eaf0dae380\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-03T22:51:33.316Z\">11.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Fact check: Mail-in voting</strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cA lot of people cheat\u201d with mail-in voting, Trump said.

the spread of the coronavirus after cases rose to nearly 60,000, almost double their level a week earlier, the World Health Organization said on Thursday.</p> <p>\u201cNew cases have been reported in some of the most vulnerable countries with fragile health systems,\u201d said Ahmed Al-Mandhari, the WHO\u2019s director for the Eastern Mediterranean region, which includes Pakistan, Afghanistan, Somalia and Djibouti, as well as Middle Eastern states.</p> <p><strong>\u201cEven in countries with stronger heath systems, we have seen a worrying spike in the numbers of cases and deaths reported,\u201d</strong> he said in a statement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e74dd0d4a22df93b97dc8d6bad85d831f29a263e\"> <img

just over 50,000 cases, confirmed coronavirus numbers have been relatively low in the Middle East compared to Europe, the United States and Asia.</p> <p>But health officials fear that cases of the highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the virus are under-reported and that many countries with weak governments and health systems eroded by conflict will struggle to cope.</p> <p>\u201cI cannot stress enough the urgency of the situation,\u201d said Mandhari. \u201cThe increasing numbers of cases show that transmission is rapidly occurring at local and community levels.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe still have a window of opportunity, but this window is slowly closing day by day,\u201d he added.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e867a2c8f08532a0e667004\" class=\"block

I\u2019m Alison Rourke and will be steering our coverage for the next few hours. </p> <p>As the number of infections rose past one million, and deaths passed 50,000, countries, including the United Sates, are taking increasing measures to combat the virus. New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, has warned his state will run out of ventilators in six days.</p> <p>Donald Trump has issued orders to use the defence production act to make ventilators. The president has also confirmed in his daily press briefing that he has tested negative for Covid-19. The US now has just under 240,000 infections and 5, 798 deaths according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker. </p> <p>Here\u2019s a summary of the other top points:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Global cases of the virus have passed one million</strong>, according to figures collected by researchers from Johns Hopkins University. Deaths worldwide have passed 50,000. <br></li> <li>In terms of deaths,<strong> Italy remains the country worst affected by the outbreak</strong>, with 13,915 fatalities, followed by Spain, with 10,003 deaths. The US is now the third worst affected country, with 5,316 total deaths.</li> <li><strong>Governments in the Middle East</strong> need to act fast to limit the spread of the coronavirus after cases rose to nearly 60,000, almost double their level a week earlier, the World Health Organization said on Thursday. </li> <li><strong>The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock,</strong> said the government was hoping to build an \u201cat-scale\u201d diagnostics industry to reach 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month, as he unveiled his five-pillar strategy. Just 5,000 NHS staff have been tested so far.</li> <li>More than 6.65 million people <strong>have filed for unemployment benefits in the US last week</strong>, according to the latest official figures, highlighting the devastating economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the American economy.</li> <li><strong>The pro-independence leader of Catalonia,</strong> the region of Spain hardest hit by the coronavirus after Madrid, has abandoned his government\u2019s initial reluctance to seek help from the Spanish army, saying any assistance would be gratefully received. </li> </ul> <p>You can get in touch with me via email alison.rourke@guardian.co.uk.
