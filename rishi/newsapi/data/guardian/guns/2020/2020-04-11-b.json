My first priority is and will always be the student-athletes and doing what is best for the program and the university.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Gundy has come under criticism since a Tuesday conference call with reporters where he said he hoped to have the team return to the on-campus football facilities on 1 May, in defiance of federal social-distancing guidelines. He said the the media has been overly negative in its coverage of what he called the \u201cChinese virus and added that if one of his players or coaches were to test positive after then, they would be \u201cquarantined just like we do people that get the flu\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe get people that get the flu during the season, we quarantine them, we treat them, we make sure they\u2019re healthy, we bring \u2018em back,\u201d Gundy said. \u201cIt would be the same thing here, but at some point, we\u2019ve got to go back to work. We\u2019ve got to get these guys back in here. ... From what I read, the healthy people can fight this, the antibodies make it better. They\u2019re doing some blood transplants now with the people that have already gotten the disease, that have gotten over it that have the antibodies that can fight it. There\u2019s a lot of people who can figure this out. May 1\u2019s our goal. Don\u2019t know if it will happen. Players will come in after that.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The remarks prompted a swift statement from the university, which said: \u201cWe will adhere to the advice of public health experts who are making informed decisions in the best interest of the citizens of our nation and state based on sound scientific data.\u201d</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s not the first time Gundy, whose annual salary is $5.13m, has whipped up controversy over his right-wing views. But USA Today\u2019s Dan Wolken made a salient point <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/dan-wolken/2020/04/07/oklahoma-state-coach-mike-gundy-coronavirus-comments/2966225001/\">in a Wednesday op-ed</a> that Gundy\u2019s political ideology is immaterial:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Hey, according to \u201cDr. Gundy,\u201d what\u2019s the harm in 18-, 19-, 20-, 21-year-olds possibly getting exposed to coronavirus? If they\u2019re healthy, it\u2019s all good, right? At any rate, we\u2019ve got to get moving, Gundy suggested, because paying salaries and \u201ccontinuing the economy in this state\u201d relies on the bodies of unpaid amateurs and people will \u201cfeel better\u201d watching football on TV.</p> \n   <p>Herd immunity, right? That\u2019s actually what Dr. Gundy was getting at. In fact, he referred to players as \u201cthe herd of healthy people\u201d who can fight the virus, even though that is, uh, not exactly the way any of this works. </p> \n   <p>None of this should be a surprise. Gundy has been edging toward the cliff of absurdity for a while now. In November 2018, he blamed \u201cliberalism\u201d for players transferring, saying \u201cI\u2019m a firm believer in the snowflake.\u201d He acknowledged Tuesday he\u2019s getting a lot of his information these days from the ultra-conservative One America News Network, an outlet he described as objective and non-political despite its history of pushing debunked right-wing conspiracy theories related to the murder of Seth Rich, and Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting survivor David Hogg.</p> \n   <p>But this isn\u2019t really about Gundy\u2019s political ideology or his sources of information. It\u2019s about him saying the quiet part out loud regarding how many college coaches view their players.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-11T22:17:48.787Z\">at 11.17pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e92312a8f08db3109f20e00\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-11T21:10:54.485Z\">10.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Arkansas senator Tom Cotton, who <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/business/media/coronavirus-tom-cotton-china.html\">floated a conspiracy theory</a> which said the Chinese government created Covid-19 in a weapons lab <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/11/republican-tom-cotton-coronavirus-china\">claimed on Saturday</a> that \u201ccommon sense has been my guide\u201d since he first learned of the outbreak in mid-January.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cNot Chinese communist lies.

And I hit a good 2-iron on 13, I was very pleased with that shot. Greg was still in it, and we both hit good chips on 15. And then the last three holes, we all know what happened, so there you go. I swallowed hard, breathed harder, that was the situation, now it was mine to lose. So I had to put my head down and grind. I\u2019m delighted the way I\u2019ve played the back nine today. I was able to enjoy it [walking up 18] but enjoy it in a strange way. I was trying to enjoy it, but I do feel sorry for Greg.\u201d That refrain again.

He looks good for his third top-ten finish in the last five visits. A top-ten finish certainly looks on the cards for Nobilo, who sends his tee shot at 16 to five feet and tidies up for birdie. A conservative punch of the air. On only his second visit here - he missed the cut on debut last year - he moves into third on his own, three off the lead, and will be ruing his failure to pick up a shot at the inviting par-five 15th. </p> <p><strong><em>-9: </em></strong><em>Faldo (12)<br> <strong>-7: </strong>Norman (12)<br> <strong>-6: </strong>Nobilo (13) <br> <strong>-5: </strong>Mickelson (13)</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e9212088f08db3109f20d90\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-11T18:54:12.987Z\">7.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Those two shots took the best part of seven minutes combined. </strong>All the options considered.

From 80 yards, he takes it out of the equation by wedging well over the flag, 15 feet past, spinning it back a little to ten feet or so. He\u2019ll have a decent look at birdie ... but that\u2019s by no means a gimme.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e92112f8f08db3109f20d8e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-11T18:52:30.748Z\">7.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>That leaves Faldo with a decision of his own. </strong>He\u2019s just off the fairway, on the first cut to the right. Does he go for the green, effectively pressing his cleats on Norman\u2019s neck? Off comes the head cover and out comes the 5-wood. He addresses the ball and ... steps back, the breeze having picked up. He addresses it again and ... steps back again! This time he\u2019s changed his mind. The gallery mutter their disapproval, but then Faldo isn\u2019t playing to, or for, them. Eventually, after a Normanesque period of reflection, he pulls out an iron. Is he going to lay up? Nope! It\u2019s a 2-iron, and one fired into the meat of the green. He\u2019ll have a look at eagle from 40 feet. Had that ball landed ten feet to the right, the camber would have taken the ball seriously close. As is, it\u2019ll do. He bounces down the fairway, full of beans.

Once they\u2019re done, the stage is set for Norman. \u201cI feel for him,\u201d says Venturi on CBS, channelling all those emotions from 40 years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to bring it back.\u201d He\u2019s got a decision to make. He\u2019s 232 yards from the pin. He can make the green, but hitting fairway wood off pine straw, a dip into Rae\u2019s Creek is a fair possibility. In an ideal world he\u2019d roll the dice and try for eagle, but he can\u2019t afford any more slip ups. After a couple of minutes of thought, and a little bit of very careful gardening, removing loose needles with a tee peg, he decides to lay up.

Back up the hole, Norman trudges up to the tee with his head hung low. Faldo has the honour, and he sends his tee shot down the right, from where he\u2019ll likely lay up.

However, Norman\u2019s game has fallen completely to pieces, his mind like a cake left out in the rain. Oh no no. It\u2019s extremely difficult to see him getting anything out of this. It\u2019s certainly hard to see him getting back into this proactively, put it that way. He might have to hope Faldo hits a bumpy stretch of his own, though those sort of meltdowns aren\u2019t really in the five-time major winner\u2019s DNA. \u201cSix-over par today. Is it possible to come back from something as great as that?\u201d The thoughts there of Bobby Clampett on CBS. Now there\u2019s someone else who\u2019ll be able to identify with Norman\u2019s plight, having led the 1982 Open at Troon by seven strokes after six holes of the third round, only to take three shots to get out of a pot bunker at 7, going on to card final rounds of 78 and 77.

Softly, softly, catchy Sharky. </strong>It\u2019s good enough to establish a two-shot lead, because Norman, freaked out after giving his birdie putt on 11 too much, doesn\u2019t give this bogey attempt enough oomph, and it\u2019s always dying to the right. A double bogey, and the world number one has shipped five shots in the last four holes. The singular pressures of Amen Corner. The gallery, astonished beyond volume, watch as mute. They came for entertainment; they\u2019re witnessing a comprehensive, root-and-branch mental capitulation. Norman had been in the lead for 49 holes, since making birdie at 17 on Thursday.

If he knocks that in, and limits the damage to bogey, it could arrest his downward momentum. It\u2019s the only way he can think about this horrific situation he\u2019s in - though trying to put a positive spin on what would be a fourth consecutive bogey takes some mental gymnastics. He trudges over Hogan\u2019s Bridge without a word. The gallery has fallen extremely quiet too. An eerie pall descends on Amen Corner. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e920c178f082dfd549d4cac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-11T18:30:12.946Z\">7.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Norman really should aim for the heart of the green. </strong>\u201cIf I was Greg, I would not take the pin on,\u201d opines Venturi, who knows a thing or two about what Norman is going through right now, having bogeyed 9, 10, 11 and 12 himself while shipping a lead on Masters Sunday in 1956. \u201cI\u2019d take it over the fat side of the bunker and put it on the green. He\u2019s not going to win it here, but he can lose it here.\u201d Greg takes the flag on. The ball begins its fateful descent over Rae\u2019s Creek. Just before it lands on the bank guarding the front of the green, one wise old Augusta punter, who clearly knows where you can and cannot take liberties, predicts in matter-of-fact style: \u201cIt\u2019s in the water.\u201d The ball slaps the face of the bank, takes one big bounce, then a couple of sweet baby ones, then topples back quietly into the drink.

After trying to shake the tension from his shoulders by letting his arms hang loose, he sets himself and ... shoves a meek putt to the right, the ball lipping out. As he taps in, the patrons of Augusta National swoon and chatter in disbelief. What on earth is happening here?!

A birdie would take him to within four of the lead ... but with the sun glinting off his flat stick, he dribbles a miserable putt wide left. Like Norman up on 10, he only half-committed to the stroke, and paid the price for his timidity. That\u2019s one hell of a yip. I wonder whether he was put off by a roar of disbelief elsewhere, as news of Norman\u2019s latest bogey was posted on the leader boards? And he nearly misses the two-footer he left himself, pulling it, the ball only just toppling in on the right. He remains at -5.

He almost quits on his par putt, and the subsequent lack of velocity means the ball\u2019s always going to turn left before reaching the cup.

He\u2019s judged it perfectly ... almost. The right-to-left breaker looks like dropping; one dimple\u2019s width to the left, and in it would have gone. But it lips out on the right. He taps in for a par, the crowd catching their breath. What pressure that would have put on Norman! Faldo looks in the mood now. Unlike his partner, he\u2019s in control of his game, and perhaps more importantly his emotions. Norman underscores the point by missing his par putt. A very timid effort, always missing on the left from the nanosecond it left the face of his flat stick. Suddenly there\u2019s just two in it, and Norman walks off - almost in silence, the gallery can\u2019t believe what is unfolding here - with extreme concern scrawled all across his face in capital letters. He\u2019s not quite reached the thousand-yard-stare stage yet, but the eyes are beginning to transmit the first distress signals of extreme inner pain.</p> <p><strong><em>-11: </em></strong><em>Norman (9)<br> <strong>-9: </strong>Faldo (9)<br> <strong>-5: </strong>Mickelson (10), Waldorf (10)<br> <strong>-4: </strong>Nobilo (12)</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e92035f8f081a236f191bf1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-11T17:51:32.062Z\">6.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Greg is off the front of 9, at the bottom of the steep slope.</strong> He\u2019s not got much green to play with, as the flag is only 20 feet over the brow.

He\u2019ll have a treacherous one coming back to save his par, but that was about as close as he could get without lucking out by hitting the flagstick or bundling the ball into the hole.

But his sand wedge, from 100 yards, isn\u2019t long enough. It reaches the green, but only just, and inevitably topples back off and down the fairway. Now he\u2019s left with a tricky up and down. Speaking of down: that\u2019s how his head is hanging, as he trudges up towards the scene of the crime. And the volume of the gallery is significantly lower too: they wanted some excitement, but they\u2019re beginning to wonder whether they\u2019re witnessing the start of a slow-motion collapse.

It's Sunday at the 1996 Masters!</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Greg Norman took a little while to get going this week. </strong>He started out on Thursday with six pars in a row, an unremarkable beginning to his latest bid for that elusive green jacket. Having missed the cut in his last two Tour events, was this shaping up to be another forgettable week for the Great White Shark?</p> <p><strong>Nope! No! No sir! </strong>See, when Greg finally gets going, he <em>really</em> gets going. You know how he rolls. Those six consecutive garden-variety pars were quickly followed by a three-birdie blitz, and suddenly he was hitting the turn in 33. Then he really started motoring, tearing up the back nine. Six more birdies on his way home, the last courtesy of a spike mark on 18 that deflected a wayward putt into the hole. Hey, when it\u2019s your day, it\u2019s your day, and you\u2019ve got to take your luck while the going\u2019s good. Back in blistering style, 30 strokes, for a course-record-equalling first round of 63.</p> <p><strong>Nick Price set that particular mark ten years ago. </strong>Ah, 1986, the year Norman got tight coming up the last, converting prime real estate in the centre of the fairway into an eminently avoidable bogey that cost him the chance of a play-off with Jack Nicklaus. He\u2019s come even closer since, denied a year later by Larry Mize\u2019s outrageous chip-in, then missing a 12-footer on 18 in 1989 for a play-off berth alongside unfortunate rhymer Scott Hoch and eventual winner Nick Faldo. But this year\u2019s opening-day 63 suggests that finally, this could be Greg\u2019s time.</p> <p><strong>Norman followed his scintillating 63 with a swell 69 and a solid 71, and goes into the final day with an almost insurmountable six-shot lead. </strong>Surely this is his day of destiny?! No player has ever shipped as big a 54-hole lead at any major, never mind here at Augusta National. In fact, it\u2019s only happened three times on Tour (Bobby Cruickshank in 1928, Gay Brewer in 1969 and Hal Sutton in 1983). It\u2019d take a meltdown of epic proportions for Norman to be denied this time. And even then, it\u2019d probably require something special from one of the chasing pack, too.</p> <p><strong>The only problem with that: Nick Faldo and Phil Mickelson are currently in second and third positions.</strong> The 25-year-old Mickelson hits it long and is fearless around the greens, with a riverboat approach to golf that Norman, pin-seeker to the marrow, will surely admire. Augusta will be Lefty\u2019s playground, maybe today, certainly sometime soon, it just <em>has</em> to be. Meanwhile the altogether more steady and sedate Faldo - twice a winner here already, in 1989 and 1990 - is probably the last player Norman would choose to go round with him in the final group this afternoon. Norman may have snatched the 1993 Open from under Faldo\u2019s nose with a final-day 64 at Sandwich, but when the two met in the last group on Open Saturday three years earlier at St Andrews, Faldo shot a sparkling 67 while Norman slumped to a three-putt-strewn 76, overheating under the intense spotlight of the high-profile head-to-head. He\u2019d do well to park that memory for the next few hours.</p> <p><strong>But look, a six-shot lead is a six-shot lead is a six-shot lead, and by rights this should be a procession. </strong>CBS will be going live soon. It\u2019s on! Before that, though, let\u2019s remind ourselves of the state of play after 54 holes...</p> <p><strong><em>-13: </em></strong><em>Greg Norman<br> <strong>-7:</strong> Nick Faldo<br> <strong>-6:</strong> Phil Mickelson<br> <strong>-4:</strong> David Frost, Scott McCarron, Duffy Waldorf<br> <strong>-3:</strong> Scott Hoch, John Huston<br> <strong>-2:</strong> David Duval, Ernie Els, Lee Janzen, Frank Nobilo, Corey Pavin, Vijay Singh, Ian Woosnam</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlpwHBn6ikg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BlpwHBn6ikg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Turn this up to 11, shut your eyes, and float away.</figcaption> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-11T16:30:32.477Z\">at 5.30pm BST</time></p>  </div>",
  "<p><strong>Names:</strong> James and Rebecca Dominguez<br><strong>Years together: </strong>26 <br><strong>Occupations:</strong> Writer and procurement officer</p> <p>It was painful at the time, but there was a clear turning point in James and Rebecca Dominguez\u2019s relationship. About 15 years ago, the Melbourne couple were at a social event and James, who has struggled with depression throughout his life, had hit a bad spot. He refers to Rebecca as his \u201crock\u201d, but on this occasion it became too much for her.</p> <p>She turned to him and said: \u201cI can\u2019t be your support person right now. There\u2019s a lot of lovely people here who love you. Please go and get support from one of them because I can\u2019t be that person right now.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/oct/04/relationships-tell-us-how-you-stay-together\">Relationships: tell us how you stay together</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That hurt, says James now. \u201cIt felt like being slapped. It was horrible. And it was necessary and absolutely the right decision \u2026 I\u2019m glad she did it.\u201d</p> <p>The candour with which James and Rebecca discuss their 26-year relationship is refreshing. They\u2019ve done plenty of work to get there. They don\u2019t shy from talking about their dynamic: while Rebecca gives James stability, he helps her work through her emotions before she makes any big decisions. \u201cThat\u2019s all really positive,\u201d says James, \u201cbut [in the first 10 years] we did get very co-dependent, and undoing that was one of the hardest things we\u2019ve ever done as a couple.\u201d</p> <p>Before the moment at the party, James says: \u201cI think I started to think of myself as half of a couple. I forgot that I\u2019m an individual as well, and I think it took Rebecca really putting her foot down to remind me of that.\u201d</p> <p>They met online in 1993, three years before the word \u201cinternet\u201d came into common usage. He was in Wagga Wagga, she was in Bendigo, and they were both on the only Australian MUD (multi-user dimensions) playing a text-based version of World of Warcraft. \u201cPeople tended to use [games] very much like World of Warcraft these days \u2026 as much for socialising as they did for actually playing a game,\u201d says James.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2d680278adb29782e1196a2cb5b8a162276b6beb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d680278adb29782e1196a2cb5b8a162276b6beb/0_0_590_745/396..jpg\" alt=\"James and Rebecca Dominguez on their wedding day in 1996.\" width=\"396\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James and Rebecca Dominguez on their wedding day in 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James and Rebecca Dominguez</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a woman online, Rebecca was a rarity and she got plenty of attention. James helped her navigate it. They struck up a connection, talking via early text chat programs, on the phone and even writing letters. But Rebecca had a boyfriend, and James was determined to remain honourable, so they remained just good friends.</p> <p>That is until they met in person. After a few months of chatting, James went to Bendigo to visit Rebecca. \u201cThe first three thoughts that went through my head were: \u2018Oh my goodness, she has beautiful eyes. Oh my goodness, she\u2019s got a beautiful smile. Oh my goodness, she\u2019s <em>so</em> short,\u2019 \u201d he says.</p> <p>But finally meeting in person was strange, says James: \u201c[I was trying to work out] how this actual physical person in the real world relates to this digital person that I\u2019ve known. Where are the common threads? Where are the differences? I\u2019m just trying to find the person that I know in this physical presence.\u201d</p> <p>They shared a kiss that weekend but went back to their lives, keeping in touch online and on late night phone calls. Then, after a couple of visits back and forth, James asked Rebecca to marry him. \u201cWe\u2019d been together in person connecting in physical space for 10 total days. I had no plan. There was no sort of agenda ... I just knew. There was a part of me that just went, this is the person I really do want to spend the rest of my life with. And so I just asked.\u201d Rebecca hesitated because of the speed of it all, but agreed.</p> <p>In 1994 they both moved to Melbourne, and after a few months they moved in together. Later that year they set a date for their wedding and were married in March 1996.</p> <p>Although they are quite different in many ways \u2013 \u201cRebecca is a very textbook introvert, and [James is] a very textbook extrovert\u201d \u2013 the couple share many interests and have similar politics. \u201cThere was always a desire to do the right thing and to try to achieve results that were as positive as was possible for everybody,\u201d says James. \u201cAnd I think that was something that we really shared. We cared about each other, but we cared about people in general, and we cared about the world.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/05/how-we-stay-together-if-a-problem-came-up-it-had-to-be-solved-straight-away\">How we stay together: 'If a problem came up, it had to be solved straight away'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of their strengths as a couple is that they are honest with each other in \u201ca constructive and compassionate way\u201d. Says James: \u201cA lot of the time when you meet people and they say that they practise radical honesty, what they mean is they\u2019re arseholes. They just mean that they don\u2019t care about other people\u2019s feelings and they just want to speak their mind and they don\u2019t care what the consequences are. I think one of the things that really drew us together is that we cared about the consequences of our own actions, and we cared about how we impacted on other people, even though we did it in very different ways.\u201d</p> <p>That honesty has helped them negotiate another part of their relationship: both are bisexual and non-monogamous. They are prominent members of Bisexual Alliance Victoria, and have had other partners at different times in their relationship.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60431e3f08d8226dbf5e6d3e113d4be5c502937a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60431e3f08d8226dbf5e6d3e113d4be5c502937a/0_200_3264_2248/1000..jpg\" alt=\"James and Rebecca at a protest in Melbourne in 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"689\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James and Rebecca at a protest in Melbourne in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James and Rebecca Dominguez</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Having other people around has meant there has been more support when things have been difficult. For instance, when Rebecca was diagnosed with breast cancer it helped to have other people to share the load: \u201cHaving all that support meant that it was easier for me and easier for James, because James knew that he wasn\u2019t on his own having to deal with this. I don\u2019t think that with my cancer diagnosis, James would have coped if there weren\u2019t other people around giving him the support he needed.\u201d</p> <p>There is rarely any serious conflict between them because they try to talk about things before they become a real issue. \u201cWhen we do disagree, we try to find a solution,\u201d says James. \u201cIt\u2019s never: \u201cHow can I win this?\u2019 It\u2019s always: \u2018How can the two of us together make this work?\u2019 And sometimes the compromise will be that somebody will miss out or both of us will get something we\u2019re not 100% happy with.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/22/how-we-stay-together-it-doesnt-feel-like-were-two-really-different-people\">How we stay together: 'It doesn't feel like we're two really different people'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Their affection for each other is obvious \u2013 James frequently slings his arm around Rebecca and she reaches out to touch him reflexively. This is deliberate, they say. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to me that people I\u2019m in a relationship with actually like me touching them,\u201d says Rebecca. \u201cI don\u2019t really see the point of being in relationships with people who don\u2019t like me to touch them \u2026 I am happy stroking and massaging and leaning into people.\u201d</p> <p>Particularly in the early days of their relationship, sex became a way of recharging their batteries, says James. \u201cTouch in general, even not actual sex ... It\u2019s like that grounding \u2026 I\u2019m here, you\u2019re there, we\u2019re touching each other and we\u2019re together, and fuck the rest of them, basically.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"029a0581003e32195213adfe0400ecd3ad26134b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/029a0581003e32195213adfe0400ecd3ad26134b/0_131_2448_3133/781..jpg\" alt=\"James and Rebecca in Pisa in 2019.\" width=\"781\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James and Rebecca in Pisa in 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James and Rebecca Dominguez</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Their other secret, says Rebecca, is that they enjoy being silly. \u201cDoing that every couple of days, just laugh until you cry, because you walk out with all those endorphins from laughing and happiness. And you can\u2019t think ill of your partner if you\u2019ve just spent together 20 minutes laughing with them.\u201d</p> <p>The couple works hard on their relationship, and where other couples grow apart, they have been very determined to grow together over their 26 years. \u201cWe spend time together and we check in about stuff. We have deep and meaningful conversations about all sorts of topics, just because they\u2019re fun,\u201d says Rebecca. \u201cI like talking to James. He\u2019s fun to talk to. And we talk a lot about stuff that\u2019s important to ourselves. It\u2019s not every single day, and it\u2019s not every single conversation that\u2019s deep and meaningful and serious, but there\u2019s a lot of checking in and a lot of making sure that we\u2019re still good.\u201d</p> <p>And they are always happy to see each other. When they were both working not far from each other they would have lunch together regularly. James remembers his colleagues asking him about it. \u201cThey were like: \u2018You live with her and see her every night.

There was also concern that they would spread Covid-19 when returning to their constituencies.</p> <p>While the parliamentary website says MPs will return to Westminster on 21 April, few believe there is any chance of this happening. But no alternative arrangements for virtual sessions have been announced.</p> <p>One senior Labour source said: \u201cI don\u2019t think this government wants parliament to return as it will allow MPs to focus on ways they are messing things up. That\u2019s why they like daily press conferences. They give them a chance to control everything.\u201d</p> <p>Patel said discussions were taking place over how parliament would resume and function. However, she insisted all focus was currently on dealing with the pandemic. \u201cI think at this particular time, we have to focus the resources of government, all our energies, every single sinew of government, focusing on saving lives and dealing with this awful disease.\u201d</p> <p>The SNP leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, said it was essential that parliament returned to work in a virtual form this week. This should include a virtual \u201cquestion time\u201d with whoever was standing in for Johnson, using a similar model to the video questions session with Nicola Sturgeon in the Scottish parliament.</p> <p>Blackford said he found it astonishing that he had yet to be asked to a confidential briefing on privy council terms by Downing Street. He also revealed that he had written to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, more than two weeks ago raising concerns about whether money would get to the most needy but had had no reply. \u201cThis is simply not acceptable,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The Tory MP David Davis, a former cabinet minister, went further saying MPs should return to Westminster in person as soon as possible and subject themselves to daily tests for Covid-19 if necessary. \u201dThe House of Commons met when air raids were going on in the war. I think it needs to be reconstituted even if it means MPs being tested every day,\u201d Davis said.</p> <p>The acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, said the lack of parliamentary scrutiny at this time was \u201cintolerable\u201d and could not be allowed to continue.</p> <p>The Green MP Caroline Lucas said: \u201cWhile parliament can\u2019t yet return to Westminster, the technology exists to enable a far greater level of remote accountability, even if it won\u2019t be able to exactly replicate the way parliament normally functions. It isn\u2019t lack of technology that\u2019s preventing recall \u2013 it\u2019s lack of political will. Other parliaments are already doing it \u2013 Westminster needs to urgently do the same.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, whose father was a bus driver in the capital, says in an article for the <em>Observer</em> online that he is exploring how protective equipment could be given to London\u2019s transport workers.

  "<p>That male drivers are much more dangerous to other road users than female ones is a proposition still considered extraordinary enough for an academic study <a href=\"https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/early/2020/03/09/injuryprev-2019-043534\">confirming this widely observed phenomenon</a> to have made headlines last week. </p> <p>Discussing the difference, the authors note, in the journal <em>Injury Prevention</em>, the major gender imbalance in driving jobs and advise policymakers that \u201creduced risk to others could be a co-benefit from increasing gender equity\u201d.</p> <p>Presumably, whatever might cause men to kill many more road users, it is not expected to lead to similarly life-threatening decisions when they are parked behind desks, as policymakers. The similarity, sex-ratio-wise, between, say, the Conservative cabinet and the inside of a road hauliers\u2019 cafe is absolutely no cause for concern, other than in terms of fairness and appearance.</p> <p>And even that disparity, as Dominic Raab used to argue, might not be the difficulty the traffic researchers imply. For one thing, unequal numbers must offer some protection against women he calls \u201c<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexwickham/dominic-raab-attitude-towards-woman-and-gender\">obnoxious bigots</a>\u201d. Using quotas to increase women\u2019s representation is, he once wrote in the <em>Times</em>, \u201cmorally wrong\u201d. According to the younger Raab, \u201cyounger men suffer as a result of previous male domination for which they bear no responsibility\u201d. He took special exception to the idea, debated after the 2008 banking collapse, that such catastrophes might be less likely under the Lehman Sisters. Michael Lewis, author of <em>The Big Short</em>, for example, said that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/19/neuroeconomics-women-city-financial-crash\">were it up to him</a>, \u201cI would take steps to have 50% of women in risk positions in banks.\u201d Christine Lagarde, the former head of the IMF, has likewise <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/05/if-it-was-lehman-sisters-it-would-be-a-different-world-christine-lagarde\">argued for increased female representation</a>: \u201cThis very diversity also leads to more prudence and less of the reckless decision-making that provoked the crisis.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One tribute celebrated Johnson\u2019s public acts of crass, heteronormative recklessness, his mad cycling and speeding</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But guided, as ever, by the science, Raab dismissed such arguments as \u201cplaying on stereotypes that paint men as innately gung-ho and women as more risk-averse\u201d.</p> <p>He could not have known that his own party would later become the sex-stereotyper\u2019s No 1 choice, having sidelined more risk-averse women in favour of a man whose catchphrase was \u201cdo or die\u201d and default insult \u201cgirly swot\u201d. Affectionate pieces about Boris Johnson, when he went into intensive care, could not have made it clearer that his risk-loving, competitive, sexually incontinent, sporty, stereotypically male performance is \u2013 at least to his fraternity of awed admirers \u2013 central to his political appeal. In one tribute, headlined \u201cMr Invincible\u201d, Stephen Robinson celebrated Johnson\u2019s public acts of crass, heteronormative recklessness, his mad cycling and speeding. \u201cFew politicians \u2013 let alone a future prime minister \u2013 could get away with having boasted, as he did in the <em>Spectator</em> magazine, of driving at 160mph up the M40.\u201d</p> <p>Yet to be established, however, is how effective the gendered display, solo and otherwise, will be in the current crisis, beyond the Johnson fan base. The flag-accessorised confirmation, at the daily death count, that men are overwhelmingly in charge has not reassured everyone and not only because it advertises, instructively for any children watching, a hierarchy unevolved, like some of the star performers\u2019 fighting rhetoric, since the second world war.</p> <p>That key decisions about containing the virus are made exclusively by men \u2013 Johnson, Matt Hancock, Raab, Michael Gove, Rishi Sunak \u2013 assisted by the \u201cget Brexit done\u201d brigade, could have implications still more troubling than this group\u2019s demonstrable indifference to the imminent impact of lockdown on women and children, its <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-52092131\">early floundering</a> on abortion. </p> <p>Of Johnson\u2019s early, already comically useless, stab at domestic advice \u2013 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52011928\">use delivery services where you can</a>\u201d \u2013 one can only think it must have sounded great over Deliveroos inside the frat house, where the ministry of dudes also believes that \u201cstrain every sinew\u201d will greatly reassure health workers actually risking their lives.</p> <p>Yesterday the government briefing was led by Priti Patel for the first time. She highlighted help to victims of domestic abuse, but it seems unlikely that regular appearances at the lectern by this or another female cabinet favourite, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2020/feb/14/how-representative-is-boris-johnsons-new-cabinet\">from the handful available</a>, would have made much difference to the Johnson cabal\u2019s strategy. Though to be fair to Patel, she might have made it more brutal. One reason sex quotas have to be substantial enough to morally outrage Raab is to ensure that female success in male-dominated institutions is not reserved for those willing to imitate stereotypical maleness, possibly in an exaggerated form.</p> <p>But what if women were fairly represented in the senior bodies protecting the UK from Covid-19? <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/uk/cabinet-reshuffle-men-boris-johnson-prepares-sack-top-women-1393752\">Was Andrea Leadsom right</a> to argue, in the <em>Telegraph </em>in February, for \u201cthe excellence that a diverse range of views brings to decision-making\u201d?

  "<p><strong>Max Porter\u2019s second novel, </strong><em><strong>Lanny</strong></em><strong>, is the semi-mythic story of the disappearance of a boy in a rural English village</strong><strong>. It follows his widely acclaimed debut, </strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/11/grief-is-the-thing-with-feathers-max-porter-paperback-of-the-week\">Grief </a></strong></em><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/11/grief-is-the-thing-with-feathers-max-porter-paperback-of-the-week\">Is the Thing </a></strong></em><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/11/grief-is-the-thing-with-feathers-max-porter-paperback-of-the-week\">With Feathers</a></strong></em><strong>. Porter, 38, until recently editorial director of Granta Books, lives </strong><strong>near Bath with his wife and </strong><strong>three sons, aged 10, seven and four</strong><strong>. This interview took place by phone</strong><strong>.</strong></p> <p><strong>How\u2019s it going?<br></strong>I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s only Wednesday. It\u2019s fine, I\u2019m learning to be patient. I can do maths with the four-year-old, but I\u2019m struggling after that. I made an obstacle course for them today. It\u2019s crazy. But then, you know, I spoke to my mate yesterday who is a GP for homeless people and is in ICU [intensive care unit] now and he is describing apocalyptic scenes. And I\u2019m here thinking well, next door\u2019s magnolia is looking good.</p> <p><strong>I suppose </strong><em><strong>Lanny</strong></em><strong> emerges somewhat out of that sense of the fragility of the beautiful surface of life</strong><strong><br></strong>I suppose so. In that if you are engaged with being alive on this planet just now and especially raising children, then if you are not terrified about the future half the time, you are not paying attention. What is weird about <em>Lanny</em> is that I realised some of what it was about after I had finished it. Certainly the environmental elements of it. Lanny himself has that easy proto-environmentalism that all children are born with.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m making presents for everyone I know who works in the NHS, with collage and paint</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>The malevolent spirit in the book, </strong><strong>Dead Papa Toothwort</strong><strong>, would have lived and breathed Covid-19\u2026<br></strong>Yeah, you would be jogging through the woods and he would just cough it out.</p> <p><strong>The book seems to channel some of the atmosphere of certain rooted mythic novels. I was reminded </strong><strong>of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/16/fiction.alangarner\">Alan Garner</a>. Did you have him in mind?</strong><br>I came late to Alan Garner, in my 20s. I have a Quaker Welsh side in my family, so I was always drawn to <em>The Owl Service</em>, and the idea that those Welsh myths were bubbling under my own life. But those weren\u2019t really sort of foundational texts for me. Likewise, someone else asked me if The Piper at the Gates of Dawn chapter in <em>The Wind in the Willows</em> was a reference point. But again I\u2019d hardly thought of that at all.</p> <p><strong>But you see the connections?<br></strong>Yes, I am becoming worryingly pagan in my reading. I have been reading about contemporary animism, and if you strip out all the stuff about druids and rune tattoos, it makes a lot of sense. It\u2019s funny, I just read Bill Bryson\u2019s terrific book about the body and the fact is, bang-up-to-date science is saying the same things about our relationship with our environment that ancient indigenous people understood. There was a review of <em>Lanny</em> that said \u201cbeware: mystical thinking\u201d and I\u2019m thinking yeah, we could probably do with a bit more of that.</p> <p><strong>You studied art history and I understand that your writing always starts with drawing \u2013 at what kind of scale?<br></strong>Just now the art projects are quite grand. I\u2019m making presents for everyone I know who works in the NHS, with collage and paint. Generally, though I am hunched over my notebook with a black fine-liner pen. I might start with two diagrammatic figures or the idea of a building. And then out of that I might get a sentence or two, or at most a paragraph and then when I sit down and write they are my raw material.</p> <p><strong>Did that habit come naturally?<br></strong>Pretty much. The great truth I learned from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/02/john-berger-obituary\">John Berger</a>, who I had a huge reading crush on, was that to put art and writing in separate buckets was to completely misunderstand how the brain worked. Art is where I begin thinking from. I am never going to be a writer who just sits down and writes paragraphs of prose.</p> <p><strong>You want to surprise yourself?<br></strong>Yes, you want to not be in control, always. Also I am a worrier. I find that writing allows me to worry about stuff better and in more detail.</p> <p><strong>There is plenty of scope for anxiety at the moment.<br></strong>Yes but the page should be the place where you do that much better than you do on Twitter or whatever.</p> <p><em><strong>Lanny</strong></em><strong> grew out of a long poem you wrote based on an inspiring friendship between a child and an older neighbour. Was that autobiographical?<br></strong>Yes, there were a few people like that. I did art lessons with my next-door neighbour Pam, who was a lovely woman who taught at the local prison. I had a really nice grandfather who taught me how to do watercolours and stuff like how to make arrows. And mainly there was my godfather, Tony, my best mate, who makes beautiful things with his hands and just gives them away. He is a working definition of the good life for me. I wrote to him a while ago and told him I was sorry this beautiful tray he had made me was all stained now, and he wrote back to say: \u201cGreat, that\u2019s how it should be\u201d. I\u2019d like to think my books can be lived with in the same way.</p> <p><strong>You are interested in oral poetic traditions. How far back do you go?<br></strong>Quite far. I\u2019m reading this great new translation by Gwyneth Lewis and Rowan Williams of <em>The Book of Taliesin</em>. And also this incredible Ethiopian spiritual text <em>The Harp of Glory</em>, which is a kind of Chaucerian love song to the virgin.</p> <p><strong>Which book or author do you always return to?<br></strong><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/13/riddley-walker-russell-hoban-bookclub\">Riddley Walker</a></em> by Russell Hoban. I first read it in my late teens \u2013 my brother gave it to me and said don\u2019t panic in the first 20 pages. And it was true, the first pages were like smoking a really bad joint, but then after that you are syntactically and emotionally and politically absolutely held in the book\u2019s spell.

  "<p><strong>Q: I need a good laugh.

She writes:</strong></p> <p>Smart, funny and deft \u2013 my favourite literary cocktail. And let\u2019s face it, we all need a good laugh at the moment. I\u2019d like to start by recommending an author whose work never fails to cheer me up \u2013 but that\u2019s not to say it\u2019s mindlessly jolly. Katherine Heiny\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/13/standard-deviation-katherine-heiny-review-aspergers\">Standard Deviation</a></em> is, in my opinion, one of the best comic novels of the past 10 years. If you like it, you should also try her short story collection: <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/readings-the-bookshelf/2015/oct/21/staff-picks-years-best-literary-fiction\">Single, Carefree, Mellow</a></em>. Also brilliant. <em>Standard Deviation</em> is more understated in its lols, but the characters \u2013 an odd couple caring for their son, who has Asperger\u2019s \u2013 are flawlessly hewn. On a similar tip, check out <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jul/07/go-bernadette-maria-semple-review\">Where\u2019d You Go, Bernadette</a></em> by Maria Semple, which is as formally exciting as <em>Bridget Jones</em>, being told in a series of documents \u2013 emails, memos, transcripts \u2013 and tells the story of a daughter trying to find her missing mother. Seriously, this book has wit for days. I also must say that <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/16/queenie-candice-carty-williams-review\">Queenie</a></em> by Candice Carty-Williams is <em>Bridget Jones</em> for the 21st century. Read it, if you haven\u2019t already. It mixes the light and dark of female experience in jaw-dropping ways.</p> <p>On to some nonfiction: treat yourself to Carrie Fisher\u2019s autobiography <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/wishful-drinking-9781847397836.html\">Wishful Drinking</a></em> \u2013 based on Fisher\u2019s one-woman stage show (aren\u2019t the best comedy narrators standup comedians at heart?) \u2013 which tells of her long, sticky life in showbiz. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/nov/21/star-writer-carrie-fisher-shines-brightest-in-her-books\">read anything</a> by Carrie Fisher. And definitely read her semi-autobiographical novel <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/postcards-from-the-edge-9781849833646.html\">Postcards </a></em><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/postcards-from-the-edge-9781849833646.html\">from the Edge</a></em> if you haven\u2019t already. I feel like I recommend that book every day of my life, but until everyone in the world has read it at least twice, I will not stop.</p> <p>Now for something a little off-piste. I listened to <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/18/the-panopticon-jenni-fagan-review\">The Panopticon</a></em> by Jenni Fagan while on a writing retreat in a motorhome recently. It\u2019s the story of a 15-year-old girl in the care system. She has the gift of the gab. It\u2019s dark as hell, but it made me laugh more than any book I can remember for a long time. Some of the scenarios Fagan paints about what the teenage girls get up to are perfect comedy vignettes with the darkest silhouettes.</p> <p>Finally, some poetry in the mix. You did say \u201csmart, funny and deft\u201d and those words bring one particular poet to mind, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/oct/28/john-cooper-clarke-my-trousers-river-island-or-ms-the-skinniest-they-do\">John Cooper Clarke</a> from Salford, near my hometown of Manchester.

  "<p>You can plan, you can plan and you can plan some more and then something happens over which you had no control, that you couldn\u2019t reasonably have been expected to foresee, and everything changes. That\u2019s not to say that there\u2019s no point in coaches and directors planning, but it is to say that there are times when entirely external events take control \u2013 and that doesn\u2019t have to mean something as enormous as coronavirus. Football can turn on events that seem random, unconnected, unpredictable \u2013 the bounce of a ball, the shape of the goalposts, the eruption of an Icelandic volcano \u2013 or on the unlikely influence of one man.</p> <p>Take, for example, the case of Gino Pivatelli, a forward for Bologna, Verona and Napoli who was top scorer in Serie A in 1955-56 and won seven caps for Italy. At the end of his career, he played 37 games for Milan, by which time he had lost some of his pace and sharpness in front of goal. He never managed them. And yet without him, the first two of their eras of European pre-eminence may never have come about.</p> <p>Milan\u2019s meeting with Benfica in the 1963 European Cup final was one of those rare crossroad games after which football history takes a decisive turn in a particular direction. Bela Guttmann had left (and cursed) Benfica the previous year in a dispute over his bonus for leading them to successive European titles. Under Fernando Riera, their football remained of the old school, attacking and individualistic. Nereo Rocco\u2019s Milan played a form of <em>catenaccio</em> and it was the mentality that underlay this that led him to pick the 30-year-old Pivatelli rather than Paolo Barison, who had scored six goals in their run to the final. Pivatelli\u2019s job was to mark M\u00e1rio Coluna, Benfica\u2019s left-half and playmaker. It was an overtly negative move. \u201cHe had practical intelligence, common sense and was extremely intuitive,\u201d said the forward Gianni Rivera. \u201cHe always knew where the least expected danger would come from.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbe3d6f3051d9d253b876956edfc55cae6f6501c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbe3d6f3051d9d253b876956edfc55cae6f6501c/0_3_3432_2058/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eus\u00e9bio puts Benfica 1-0 up at Wembley in the 1963 European Cup final against Milan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eus\u00e9bio puts Benfica 1-0 up at Wembley.

Jos\u00e9 Altafini levelled 13 minutes after the break. A minute after that came the decisive moment. Coluna intercepted a Pivatelli pass inside his own half and advanced. Space was opening up. If he\u2019d been able to play the pass, Benfica would have been three on two. But he wasn\u2019t allowed to. Pivatelli closed in, clipped his back leg and brought him down. The attack was thwarted, but worse than that, Coluna had broken a bone in his foot and was forced off. In the days before substitutes it was a decisive blow. Coluna did hobble back on with 10 minutes remaining but it was a gesture, no more. Altafini had added his second 11 minutes after his first, and Milan won 2-1.</p> <p>On the 24th anniversary of the final, RAI, the Italian state broadcaster, gathered Coluna, the Milan captain that day, Cesare Maldini, and the journalist Gianni Min\u00e0 in a studio to watch the game again. \u201cAwful challenge, eh?\u201d Min\u00e0 said after the foul, before broaching directly the suspicion that has always lingered. \u201cLads, after 24 years, can we say whether that foul was ordered or not?\u201d</p> <p>Maldini was adamant: \u201cAbsolutely not. Clearly it was a foul, but ...\u201d</p> <p>Coluna, agitated, silenced him with a wave of the hand, pointing at the screen. \u201cLook how far away the ball is,\u201d he said, through an interpreter. \u201cPivatelli got nowhere near it!\u201d</p> <p>The truth is the foul was cynical rather than malicious. It was late and clearly designed to bring the counter to an end, but it wasn\u2019t the sort of crunching foul that characterised football in the sixties. And besides, if Pivatelli had been acting under instruction to crock Coluna, why wait until nearly an hour had been played? Nonetheless, as Min\u00e0 acknowledged, the foul settled the game. <em>Catenaccio</em> had been validated as a style of play that could win the biggest European trophies.</p> <p>The age of innocence, of Real Madrid and Benfica and all-out attack, of finals that finished 4-3 and 7-3 and 5-3 was over. Rocco \u2013 and two of the same players, Giovanni Trapattoni and Rivera \u2013 added a second European crown six years later. Inter, with their version of <em>catenaccio</em>, won the European Cup in 1964 and 1965, as well as reaching the semi-finals in 1966 and the final in 1967. Pivatelli\u2019s foul, symbolically at least, had been the moment when the Italians and defensive pragmatism took over.</p> <p>Pivatelli retired that summer at the age of 30 and soon found a job coaching an amateur side in Fusignano, a comune with a population of about 8,000 in the northern province of Ravenna. He had in his squad a right-footed 18-year-old left-back who was enthusiastic but not particularly gifted. \u201cWhen you get the ball,\u201d he told him, \u201cgive it to [the playmaker] Pollini.\u201d But the full-back wasn\u2019t happy with that, less, it seemed, because it diminished his own role than because he felt football shouldn\u2019t be played like that. Eventually Pivatelli had to tell him that he would never be a regular starter; he just wasn\u2019t good enough.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64f5aa1d1edf4e92be9510fd75b4fdb55a62c1f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64f5aa1d1edf4e92be9510fd75b4fdb55a62c1f4/0_234_2384_1431/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arrigo Sacchi with Milan\u2019s Marco van Basten, Franco Baresi, Silvio Berlusconi, Frank Rijkaard and Ruud Gullit with the European Cup in 1990\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arrigo Sacchi (second left) with Milan\u2019s Marco van Basten, Franco Baresi, Silvio Berlusconi, Frank Rijkaard and Ruud Gullit with the European Cup in 1990.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imago/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the full-back, it was the first major turning point in his life. He gave up his dreams of being a player and decided to become a coach, to put into practice his belief that there shouldn\u2019t be just one playmaker but that every player in the team should be a protagonist. It took a long time, but Arrigo Sacchi did become a coach. Twenty years later he took charge of Parma and, after his then Serie B side beat Milan in the 1986\u201187 Coppa Italia, he was made manager of the <em>Rossoneri</em>. Within three years Milan had won two more European Cups and, more than that, their hard pressing style had redefined Italian football.</p> <p>What if Pivatelli hadn\u2019t been so decisive? What if Sacchi had hung on playing low-level amateur football? There were many other factors in Milan\u2019s late-80s rise under the presidency of Silvio Berlusconi, but that detail was critical. Pivatelli, with a foul and some straight words to a teenager, incidents a little over a year apart, twice transformed the history of the club. Plans are important but, sometimes, stuff just happens.</p>",

Other problems included seizures and conditions involving the supply of blood to the brain.</p> \n  <p>The team add that neurological problems were more common among those with more severe forms of Covid-19, while they note some patients who went on to be diagnosed with Covid-19 turned up at the hospital only with neurological problems and without typical symptoms such as a fever or cough.</p> \n  <p>The team also point to previous research which revealed that the coronavirus gets into human cells by interacting with an enzyme, called ACE2 that is present on the membranes of cells in the lungs as well as in the nervous system and skeletal muscle.</p> \n  <p>However, the study has limitations, including that it only involves a small group of patients, certain tests were not carried out due to infection concerns \u2013 meaning most problems were simply described by patients \u2013 and it is not clear to what extent the coronavirus is causing the neurological problems, or whether they were already present.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JAMANeuro/status/1248659372710006785\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p

Cambridge, said there were a number of initiatives looking into possible neurological problems linked to Covid-19.</p> \n  <p> But, she added, some of the symptoms outlined in the study may not be down to such disorders per se, noting symptoms such as dizziness and headaches are common when people are unwell, while symptoms such as loss of muscle mass can occur when people are bed-bound, and cognitive impairment can be a byproduct of being in intensive care.</p> \n  <p>But Newcombe noted that it was likely some patients were experiencing true neurological problems, noting reports of higher rates of stroke and blood clots, including in the lungs, chime with what she had seen.</p> \n  <p>Others said the results were not surprising.</p> \n  <p><strong>\u201c</strong>Many respiratory viruses appear to not only affect the respiratory system but can spread from the airways to the central nervous system,\u201d said Prof Julian Hiscox, chair in infection and global health at the University of Liverpool<strong tabindex=\"-1\">.</strong></p> \n  <p>Prof Ian Jones, professor of virology, at the University of Reading, added that the new findings should not distract from the focus on the respiratory problems Covid-19 causes.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAt the moment neurological complications might best be considered a consequence of Covid-19 disease severity rather than a distinct new concern,\u201d he said.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-11T10:19:45.025Z\">at 11.19am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div

Church leaders from across the UK have used social media and streaming to keep their congregations, many of whom are in their 80s and 90s, connected to the church when many are in isolation.</p> \n  <p>Rev Peter Atkinson has recreated Worcester Cathedral in a spare bedroom in his house from where he broadcasts morning services for people to stream at home.

Due to all of their Easter services going online, it \u201cprovides more opportunity to people to get involved and I don\u2019t think the church will ever be the same again!\u201d</p> \n  <p>There are members of the congregation who are in their 80s and 90s who are now using Google Meets and other social media to stay connected to the church whilst in isolation. The reverend believes because younger members of the family are now stuck at home they now have the time to show their family members how to use the internet.</p> \n  <p>Rev Jim McNeil, who has served as minister for Alva Church in Scotland for 22 years, described himself as a \u201cbit of a technophobe\u201d before using Facebook to record and upload sermons.</p> \n  <p>There have been videos every night of holy week leading up to Easter Sunday and they are all recorded from inside the church and have proven to be popular.

  "<p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has revealed that 19 UK health workers have died after contracting coronavirus, amid further backlash over his request that NHS staff do not overuse protective equipment.</p> \n<p>Hancock said on Saturday he was unaware of any link between the deaths and a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) but an investigation would be carried out into the extent to which health workers had caught the virus on the frontline.</p> \n<p>He told Sky News his \u201cheart goes out to their families\u201d and it was \u201cheart-rending\u201d that such a high proportion of the victims were people who migrated to the UK to work for the NHS.</p> \n<p>On Friday Hancock <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/10/matt-hancock-urges-public-not-to-overuse-ppe\">urged</a> the public to \u201ctreat PPE as the precious resource it is\u201d following weeks of criticism over the lack of vital equipment.</p> \n<p>The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) dismissed any suggestions that healthcare staff were abusing or overusing PPE. The RCN\u2019s general secretary, Dame Donna Kinnair, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Saturday that no PPE was \u201cmore precious a resource than a healthcare worker\u2019s life, a nurse\u2019s life, a doctor\u2019s life\u201d.</p> \n<p>Speaking later on BBC Breakfast, Kinnair said she was hearing from nurses every day that they did not have enough protective equipment.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>She said: \u201cI take offence actually that we are saying that healthcare workers are abusing or overusing PPE.

That they do not have adequate supply of protective equipment.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said it was insulting to suggest frontline healthcare workers were wasting PPE. He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Keir_Starmer/status/1248884684949524486\">tweeted:</a> \u201cThere are horrific stories of NHS staff and care workers not having the equipment they need to keep them safe. The government must act to ensure supplies are delivered.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dr Rinesh Parmar, chair of grassroots union the Doctors\u2019 Association, said it was \u201cunfathomable\u201d that the health secretary was \u201cdeflecting the blame at dedicated frontline workers for the shortages of [PPE]\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt a time when healthcare workers are also dying from the virus, we\u2019re now seeing blame shifting on to NHS staff who put their lives on the line day after day,\u201d he added. \u201cGuidelines remain conflicting and NHS staff simply want to protect themselves, their patients, colleagues and family members \u2013 this is not too great an ask.\u201d</p> \n<p>The union claims that official guidance as to what level of protective equipment doctors should wear while resuscitating Covid-19 patients contradicts that of leading medical organisations.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.resus.org.uk/media/statements/resuscitation-council-uk-statements-on-covid-19-coronavirus-cpr-and-resuscitation/covid-healthcare/\">Resuscitation Council UK</a> considers chest compressions to be an \u201caerosol generating procedure\u201d (AGP) and recommends all team members wear a certain level of protective equipment before entering a room where it is being carried out.</p> \n<p>This recommendation is based upon evidence from around the world and in conjunction with the European Resuscitation Council and the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, the association said.</p> \n<p>Public Health England guidance, on the other hand, does not consider the same procedure to be an AGP. First responders can commence chest compressions without that same level of equipment, \u201cwhile awaiting the arrival of other clinicians to undertake airway manoeuvres,\u201d according to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe\">its guidance</a>.</p> \n<p>The row came <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarkerJParker/status/1249007688920576001/photo/1\">as it emerged</a> that London\u2019s Kingston hospital NHS foundation trust is set to run out of disposable gowns by Sunday. Intensive care unit staff, among others, have been issued with yellow plastic overalls as a replacement, which they will be tasked with washing.</p> \n<p>The government has urged the public to stay at home over the Easter holiday to slow the spread of the coronavirus. </p> \n<p>A British scientist has said a coronavirus vaccine could be ready as soon as September. Sarah Gilbert, a professor of vaccinology at Oxford University, told the Times she was \u201c80% confident\u201d the vaccine being developed by her team would work, and human trials were due to begin in the next fortnight.</p> \n<p>She said: \u201cI think there\u2019s a high chance that it will work based on other things that we have done with this type of vaccine. It\u2019s not just a hunch and as every week goes by we have more data to look at \u2026 I would go for 80%. That\u2019s my personal view.\u201d</p> \n<p>Most industry experts say a vaccine could take as long as 18 months to be developed and distributed globally. However, Gilbert believes letting volunteers from places that have not imposed lockdowns become infected naturally as soon as possible will accelerate the clinical trial process.</p> \n<p>She said: \u201cIf one of those [places] turns out to have a high rate of virus transmission then we will get our efficacy results very quickly, so that is one strategy for reducing the time. Total lockdowns do make it harder. But we don\u2019t want the herd immunity either. We want them to be susceptible and exposed for the trials purely to test the efficacy.\u201d</p> \n<p>For the vaccine to be distributed in the autumn, Gilbert said the government would need to start production before it was proven to work. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get to later this year and discover we have a highly effective vaccine and we haven\u2019t got any vaccine to use.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><strong>I was deaf, </strong>sometimes profoundly, until I was about 12. I\u2019d have an operation \u2013 I\u2019d had seven by then \u2013 get partial hearing, then lose it again. Finally, they couldn\u2019t patch up my eardrum any more, so they had to fashion a new one. I\u2019d say my hearing is at about 65% now.</p> <p><strong>It made me a more</strong> thoughtful, peaceful person, as well as hyper-observant. I can read people\u2019s body language, which has heightened my ability to make good decisions. Growing up with a disability also makes you obsessed with control, so I\u2019ve never even tried alcohol, even though it seems like I\u2019m drunk on Twitter.</p> <p><strong>I decided to </strong>absolve myself of shame before I turned 30. My therapist said: \u201cA doormat is already lying down \u2013 that\u2019s why people wipe their feet all over it!\u201d That changed the course of my life. It was empowering for me to realise that there might be a way for me to change how people interact with me. Projecting a lack of give-a-fucks has meant fewer people fuck with me.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019ve been saying how</strong> I feel on the internet for 10 years, but I never had a big following, so I was never able to do much harm \u2013 or much good. Out of nowhere, I now have more than 4 million people at my fingertips. After a decade of people not really listening to you, you\u2019re not prepared for that responsibility. I have learned to be much more careful when calling someone out, especially if that person is already at a disadvantage.</p> <p><strong>I think I\u2019m less</strong> annoying in person than I am on Twitter. I live online as a provocateur. Sometimes you have to say things that are going to piss people off in order to create discussion. I\u2019m outrageous about abortion. I say things that might come across as insensitive so that thousands of people join a conversation. That\u2019s not to defend all my insensitivity. Sometimes I genuinely get it wrong.</p> <p><strong>The worst I feel </strong>is when someone has misconstrued my tone, or I\u2019ve misrepresented myself, and I\u2019ve hurt a group of people by mistake. That burns me to my core. I can\u2019t sleep and I can\u2019t eat. I recently criticised a rapper on Twitter for talking about doing a water fast, not knowing that she was mentally ill. I should have known better to send any kind of negativity her way. I felt gutted and embarrassed and very sorry.</p> <p><strong>Everything I try</strong> to say about [my coming out as queer] is always, without fail, twisted. So I\u2019m not talking about it any more. I said what I needed to say at the time. I addressed the unfortunate timing, it\u2019s all out now, and there isn\u2019t really any more to be said.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019m happy to be</strong> called out. I don\u2019t mind learning in public. I\u2019ve become a better person for it. What I find frustrating is that when you admit you were wrong people seem to attack you more. When I apologise there\u2019s a hysteria of bullying. We\u2019re so unaccustomed to dealing with humility, you sometimes get treated worse than if you say nothing. There\u2019s no accountability, and no opportunity to learn \u2013 it really halts evolution. It\u2019s not a weakness to apologise.</p> <p><strong>Once people get</strong> an appetite for you, suddenly the industry envelops you and boosts you. People write about you as if you are a saint, the saviour of humanity. They build you up to a point where the expectation of you isn\u2019t sustainable. You can\u2019t maintain that standard, which you never actually professed to have. It\u2019s stressful for female celebrities.</p> <p><strong>There\u2019s a particular </strong>vitriol towards women with money. We can handle men living lavish lifestyles, but when a woman does the same thing we drag her down for how gaudy she is. You can see the beginnings of it with Phoebe Waller-Bridge. As soon as she signed that $20m deal with Amazon, people suddenly started to bring up her privilege, even though we\u2019ve known about that from the beginning \u2013 she\u2019s got a double-barrelled name!</p> <p><strong>I\u2019m not very </strong>interested in other people\u2019s opinions of me. That\u2019s liberating. I feel like I haven\u2019t seen enough change over the course of my life. As I\u2019ve grown older, I\u2019ve become more aggressive, because nothing is moving fast enough. I can\u2019t just sit here and wish for the best any more. The fact that I\u2019ve got the privilege of a platform means I have a real chance to at least do something. </p> <p><em>The podcast I Weigh with Jameela Jamil debuted on 3 April</em></p>",

  "<p>The broadcaster Chris Packham has said he will continue his fight against the construction of HS2, which environmentalists say is leading to irreversible destruction of ancient habitats and woodlands.</p> <p>Last week Packham applied for an urgent injunction to halt construction work and argued for a judicial review of the government\u2019s decision-making process in relation to the \u00a3106bn high-speed railway.</p> <p>The high court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/03/hs2-ancient-wood-clearance-go-ahead-chris-packham-legal-bid-fails\">dismissed his case</a>, concluding: \u201cThe clearance works were long ago authorised by parliament and there is a strong public interest in ensuring that, in a democracy, activities sanctioned by parliament are not stopped by individuals merely because they do not personally agree with them.\u201d</p> <p>On Saturday Packham said he would appeal against the decision. \u201cIn these times of climate and environmental emergency, resilience is key,\u201d he said. \u201cNow is not the time to give up, now is the time to muster and protect what we have left.\u201d</p> <p>He said he was heartbroken at the failure to halt the ongoing clearance works on the project and said ancient trees and important habitats were being lost.</p> <p>\u201cThese are ancient woodlands that used to provide a safe and stable home to an abundance of wildlife, parts of which are now gone forever,\u201d he said. \u201cThe works are completely irreversible. Yet still we fight on, as we must try to protect all the other precious flora and fauna which is at risk from the HS2 project.\u201d</p> <p>A number of MPs wrote to HS2 Ltd\u2019s chief executive, Mark Thurston, last month detailing residents\u2019 concerns about the project and urging him to halt all construction work during the coronavirus emergency.</p> <p>There have been claims that construction teams were ignoring the government\u2019s physical distancing rules during the lockdown.</p> <p>The RSPB has also urged HS2 not to clear woods during the April\u2013September nesting season. Destruction of active birds\u2019 nests is illegal, and the charity has asked local people to report any incidents they see to the police.</p> <p>Five ancient woodlands are the focus of HS2 \u201cenabling\u201d works: Broadwells Wood, Birches Wood, Crackley Woods and Ashow Road Wood in Warwickshire and Fulfen Wood in Staffordshire.</p> <p>Packham had been seeking an interim injunction from the high court to halt all clearance and construction works. He was also seeking a judicial review of the decision to allow HS2 to proceed, on the basis that it was predicated on the findings and recommendations of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/oakervee-review-of-hs2\">the Oakervee review</a>. Packham said the review \u2013 by a former chair of HS2 Ltd \u2013 failed to provide an independent, impartial and rigorous appraisal of relevant environmental and climate change factors.</p> <p>Carol Day, a solicitor at the law firm Leigh Day,<strong> </strong>which is representing Packham, argued that the high court had failed to \u201cproperly address parts of his claim in relation to the loss of irreplaceable ancient woodlands and climate change\u201d.</p> <p>She added: \u201cHe [Packham] believes that if the government is determined to proceed with this costly and damaging project, it must be on the basis of a full and proper understanding of the environmental impacts. Now more than ever it should be recognised that meeting our international environmental obligations has a vital part to play in protecting nature and human health.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for HS2 said<strong> </strong>all its ecology work was carried out in accordance with the law under the supervision of professionally qualified ecologists. It said licences from Natural England ensured the correct safeguards were in place to protect wildlife.</p> <p>Its statement added: \u201cTo ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of our workforce and the communities in which we are working, only construction sites that can maintain government guidelines and are critical to the delivery of HS2 will remain operational.\u201d</p> <p>It said work had paused at some sites, \u201calthough some sites may remobilise if our contractors are confident they can operate in line with PHE and industry guidance\u201d.</p> <p>It said: \u201cThose sites still working are doing so because they are confident they are operating within PHE guidelines, and will be monitored and remain under constant review.\u201d</p> <p>A DfT spokesperson said: \u201cWe have tasked HS2 Ltd with delivering one of the UK\u2019s most environmentally responsible infrastructure projects. While our current priority is combating the spread of coronavirus, we must continue our work to level up the country. HS2 will be crucial to that ambition, boosting capacity and connectivity across our rail network.\u201d</p>",

I don\u2019t mean that sitcoms are racist again or that bin bags are piling up in the streets, although, for those of us who are lucky enough to be able to work from home while semi-dressed, the concept of a regular work week is starting to lose its shape, like a baggy old pair of pants. Which, incidentally, may also have been deemed a suitable work outfit, not so long ago.</p> <p>Like seemingly everyone else on the internet, celebrities have begun to put a retro filter on their lockdown activities.

It was all self-improvement this and reading list that. I talked about starting a book club. I signed up for a four-week course in Irish language and culture, but it\u2019s been three weeks and I\u2019m languishing at 15% of week one: <em>Rebecca is ainm dom</em>. Instead, I\u2019m hoovering up articles that say it\u2019s normal to spend entire days and nights refreshing news pages in a state of idle despair, because these aren\u2019t ideal circumstances to do much of anything else, with apologies to key workers, who must be thoroughly over people moaning about boredom and these endless catch-up guides to all the telly you simply must watch.</p> <p>As hashtag content goes, in the watchability stakes, a low-level hum of inert worry is more <a href=\"https://www.nowness.com/story/andy-warhols-sleep\">Andy Warhol\u2019s</a> <em>Sleep</em> than <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>. I\u2019ll take the chirpy do-something celebrity stories over the ones carping on about mansion life \u2013 oh, the horror, which garden shall I choose? \u2013 because at least it throws up some curveballs.

We\u2019ve got a cheap old projector and, after moving furniture to clear some wall space, with a glass of wine and a bit of imagination, it just about works.

  "<h2><strong>I\u2019m confused by all these new words\u2026</strong></h2> \n<p>Seldom have we had to get to grips so quickly with a slew of new terms and abbreviations. Had you told most people last Christmas that soon they would be WFH, they might have considered it a cryptic insult. Most probably had only a vague idea what an epidemiologist did or what a ventilator was, while PPE was (if anything) a soft Oxford degree favoured by politicians, rather than the personal protective equipment now urgently needed in hospitals. Few could have told you the difference between an epidemic (the outbreak and rapid spread of an infectious disease through a population) and a pandemic (an epidemic that occurs over a very wide geographical area, perhaps the whole world).</p> \n<p>Even the terminology of the virus itself is challenging: the coronaviruses are a family of pathogens, this particular one (being related to that which caused the Sars outbreak of 2002-3) denoted Sars-CoV-2. Covid-19 is the respiratory syndrome it causes, much as Aids is to HIV. A vaccine confers immunity (probably just for a limited period) to the virus; an antiviral interferes with viral replication in the body to slow or arrest its bad effects. Antibiotics attack bacterial pathogens, not viruses, but may be needed with Covid-19 to treat secondary infections such as pneumonia that take advantage of a compromised immune system. Expect to hear lots in the coming weeks about serological tests, which look for proteins in the blood that signal past infection, even if the virus has long since been cleared from the body. Those tests are under development, and they will provide vital information on how widespread infection has been \u2013 and whether many (or few) have had Covid-19 without any symptoms at all.</p> \n<p>While comparisons with wartime and the blitz spirit are deeply misleading, one analogy holds: the second world war slogan \u201cLoose talk can cost lives\u201d is apt here too.</p> \n<h2><strong>What\u2019s an important number and what\u2019s not?</strong></h2> \n<p>What makes the coronavirus so deadly is a combination of two numbers. The reproduction number (denoted R<sub>0</sub>) is the average number of people an infected individual goes on to infect in the absence of any social distancing or quarantining; the mortality rate is the percentage of infected people who die.</p> \n<p>Both depend on the biology of the virus, but neither is fixed. R<sub>0</sub> for the coronavirus is about 2.5 to three (compared with 1.3 for common flu), but that\u2019s an average \u2013 it varies from person to person. Reducing person-to-person contacts cuts the <em>effective</em> reproduction number R \u2013 and the epidemic will decay if it drops below one. The mortality rate, meanwhile, depends on the availability of healthcare for people with the most serious symptoms: it is about 0.4% in Germany, 4.6% in the UK, and more than 10% in Iran.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e8a5d369-ef41-4b4a-adf8-f34313e47e32\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you've started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;<b>stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.<br></p>\n    <p>If you live with other people,&nbsp;<b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p>After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine.

The good news is that if more people have the virus than we know, the mortality rate will be lower than the \u201cofficial\u201d value. There have been speculations that the extent of infection might be <em>much</em> greater than thought, and that most cases don\u2019t even show symptoms.

It has been as frustrating and unsettling to science reporters as it has to everyone else to find experts at loggerheads over basic concepts such as \u201cherd immunity\u201d. It is, frankly, still a source of puzzlement why it took <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf\">a single modelling study</a> from Imperial College London to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/new-data-new-policy-why-uks-coronavirus-strategy-has-changed\">persuade expert government scientific advisers</a> of what other experts (such as those at the World Health Organization) had been saying all along: that without stringent containment measures, the UK death rate would be catastrophic.</p> \n<p>So now even the fine details of the science are being held up to us all for scrutiny. It\u2019s unprecedented for a national newspaper to publish a full, simplified version of a scientific paper, as the<em> Observer</em> did with the Imperial study. There will need to be more of this and with luck, it will spread understanding of how scientific results are carefully formulated and circumscribed with caveats, so that experts are seen as well-informed specialists doing their best with the tools and data at hand.</p> \n<p>With the stakes this high, experts exploring speculative ideas take on a responsibility they aren\u2019t used to. A study from epidemiologists at Oxford recently caused a stir when it was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ff6469a-6dd8-11ea-89df-41bea055720b\">reported as claiming</a> that as much as half of the UK population might have already been infected with the coronavirus, mostly without any symptoms. The work was quite reasonably exploring a \u201cwhat if\u201d scenario. But the headline in the <em>Financial Times</em> made it sound like an empirical possibility. Researchers will need to be more explicit about what their findings do and do not mean.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"deefdfcc0a22748ef120307e4f9a8f79b8709230\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/deefdfcc0a22748ef120307e4f9a8f79b8709230/0_227_5036_3023/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A researcher works on virus replication in order to develop a vaccine against coronavirus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A researcher works on virus replication in order to develop a vaccine against coronavirus.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Douglas Magno/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>What do I need to know about vaccine development?</strong></h2> \n<p>All drugs have to pass stringent tests before they are approved for use. In general they are first tested on animals, and then enter \u201cclinical trials\u201d on humans, of which there are three stages. Phase one, conducted on small numbers of healthy volunteers, checks for safety, looking for toxicity or serious side-effects. Phase two then tests whether the drug actually works in humans with the condition targeted. Finally, phase three trials are conducted on large numbers of people \u2013 typically hundreds or thousands \u2013 to see how it will work in the clinic and make sure there are no other complications or failures before making the drug generally available.</p> \n<p>Vaccines will have to go through all of these phases, and could, like most candidate drugs, fail at any one of them. While drug-regulation agencies are considering ways to streamline and fast-track the process because of the urgency of the situation, this can only go so far. A coronavirus vaccine would be given to millions of healthy people \u2013 ultimately, perhaps to most of the world\u2019s population \u2013 and so it\u2019s more essential than ever that its safety is checked thoroughly.</p> \n<p>What\u2019s more, even when a vaccine gets approved, manufacturing it at such a large scale will be a tremendous challenge \u2013 only a few pharmaceutical companies worldwide have that capacity. And distribution will present difficulties too, especially to more remote parts of developing countries, or among overcrowded, poorer neighbourhoods in large megacities. If, as is hoped, a vaccine is ready by the middle of 2021, that speed will be remarkable and unprecedented.</p> \n<h2><strong>What about drug treatments, including existing ones?</strong></h2> \n<p>It is hoped that some antivirals already developed and tested for other conditions, such as Ebola (remdesivir) or Sars, could work for Covid-19, because they attack similar targets in the virus. In that case some of the testing has essentially already been done, so we would get a head start. There is also broader interest in \u201cdrug repurposing\u201d \u2013 investigating whether the many drugs that failed for their intended use, but which passed the safety trials, could prove effective for quite different conditions.</p> \n<p>In tests on a new drug \u2013 how safe or effective it is \u2013 it matters how big the sample is. Drugs don\u2019t get approved until they have been tested on hundreds or thousands of people, so outcomes for just a dozen or so are highly preliminary and far from proving efficacy.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/apr/06/the-hunt-for-a-coronavirus-vaccine-podcast\">The hunt for a coronavirus vaccine | podcast</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Be especially cautious of reports that rely heavily on quotes from drug companies. They are very unlikely to be lying, but institutional press offices have become accustomed to putting a rosy spin on their researchers\u2019 work and drug companies are under commercial pressures that don\u2019t always encourage them to give the full picture. You needn\u2019t be cynical, just cautious.</p> \n<h2><strong>Should I keep scanning Twitter?</strong></h2> \n<p>Whether Twitter is a handy, up-to-the-minute source of information, or a hive of misinformation and conspiracy theories, is largely up to you. All the usual caveats about using Twitter \u2013 beware of strong opinions from pseudonymous tweeters with 15 followers, or of hot takes from media loudmouths with no expertise \u2013 are multiplied and compounded here. For the problem with the subject of coronavirus on Twitter is that it\u2019s not just the trolls and attention-seekers who are weighing in. Plenty of serious academics, too, have taken it upon themselves to become epidemiologists and virologists overnight, criticising or praising scientific studies or government policies with all the assurance of seasoned veterans. Often what they say is not ignorant or wild, but merely narrow and lacking context \u2013 they might be good at interpreting statistics, say, while having no knowledge of viral transmission or mass behaviour. Fear seems to be causing the usual academic caution to be replaced by hubris.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6087767440b433bf86aba675879888cfad990afc\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6087767440b433bf86aba675879888cfad990afc/0_194_3572_2145/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Woman looking at a Twitter feed of Canadian PM\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Twitter can be a source of vital information \u2026 if you know where to look.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>I read this great analysis on Medium\u2026</strong></h2> \n<p>As the site itself says, \u201cAnyone can publish on Medium \u2026 but we don\u2019t fact-check every story.\u201d Make that your starting point for anything you read there.</p> \n<p>This doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s wrong. But the authoritative-looking stuff you might encounter is probably not coming from experts. One post that went viral, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-the-hammer-and-the-dance-be9337092b56\">Coronavirus: The Hammer and the Dance</a>, which used an array of charts and statistics to argue for strong containment measures to avoid massive fatalities, was by Tomas Pueyo, a Silicon Valley consultant who works on educational online content and has no epidemiological training. His post was promoted by a content marketing firm and was shared by the likes of Margaret Atwood and Steven Pinker. Whether or not it was accurate in all its details, it sent out a needed wake-up call about the dangers. But other unqualified \u201ccorona influencers\u201d have spread dangerous messages, for example about hoaxes and bogus treatments. Medium has <a href=\"https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045484653-COVID-19-Content-Policy\">now announced</a> that it will give \u201ccareful scrutiny to coronavirus-related content to help stem misinformation that could be detrimental to public safety\u201d, and will remove any that it deems harmful.</p> \n<h2><strong>How do I spot a coronavirus conspiracy theory?</strong></h2> \n<p>First ask: does this theory confirm the suspicion I\u2019ve had all along? About, for instance, 5G? Because if so, double your scepticism and then double it again. We aren\u2019t so much duped as flattered into buying these theories, and the first defence against confirmation bias is to recognise that no one has natural immunity to it.</p> \n<p>The harder ones to avoid are political, because they both speak more directly to our prejudices and are tougher to disprove. Is it \u201cobvious\u201d that, say, the government is just trying to keep its big-business donors happy at the expense of our own safety? We\u2019d do well to assume in the first instance that leaders and policymakers are not Machiavellian strategists but error-prone muddlers like the rest of us.</p> \n<p>Sorting fact from fiction is made harder by the media habits acquired during Brexit \u2013 the tendency of broadcast journalists and other media reporters to tweet unattributed and unconfirmed rumours. This grave global crisis should prompt some journalists to take a hard look at the ways they have become accustomed to working.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cI knew it would be a flame that would die down very quickly, and that\u2019s exactly what happened,\u201d Richard E Grant tells me, talking about the comedown that\u2019s following a frenetic, flashy 12-month period.</p> <p>He\u2019s sitting across from me at a hotel in Manhattan, pre-quarantine, and reflecting on a year that started with a role in true-crime black comedy <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/03/can-you-ever-forgive-me-review-melissa-mccarthy-richard-e-grant-lee-israel\">Can You Ever Forgive Me?</a></em>, for which he received an Oscar nomination, and ended with a part in the 2019 film S<em>tar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</em>.</p> <p>He\u2019s far from glum about the calm after the hurricane (when we meet, he\u2019s on such ebullient form that it\u2019s hard to imagine him being glum about anything) but he\u2019s confident that, at 62, he won\u2019t be \u201cthe guy of this moment\u201d at any other point in his career. He is, he says, a \u201cjourneyman\u201d actor who briefly moved out of the wings and into the spotlight. It\u2019s a definition that could be viewed as overly self-deprecating, given his body of work, but there\u2019s something both grandiose and unassuming about Grant, whose luvvie-ness is grounded with a hefty dose of realism.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have a delusion or an expectation that there\u2019d be a sudden shift and I\u2019d be offered a thousand things,\u201d he says of his post-<em>Can You Ever Forgive Me?</em> high. \u201cOf course, I did get offered a lot of stuff.\u201d But he says it was mostly \u201cbad or just entirely unsuitable\u201d or, at times, \u201cinappropriate\u201d, and he\u2019s quick to assure me that his status is by no means a guarantee of anything. He doesn\u2019t get offered roles outright still, having to audition \u201cfor every job\u201d he\u2019s ever had, regardless of scale, from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/02/withnail-and-i-review\">Withnail &amp; I</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/02/withnail-and-i-review\"> in 1987 </a>right through to the reason I was chatting to him, the whimsical new TV drama <em>Dispatches From Elsewhere</em>. The series is just winding up on US screens and premieres on 29 April in the UK on BT TV.</p> <p>The show, a scrappy yet well-reviewed mixture of <em>Eternal Sunshine </em><em>of the Spotless Mind</em> and David Fincher\u2019s <em>The Game</em>, sees a group of disparate Philadelphians trying to piece together a mysterious citywide puzzle constructed by a shadowy company, headed up by Grant\u2019s character.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I encounter cruelty or rudeness from people, I will do everything to either avoid them or expose them.</p> <footer> <cite>Richard E Grant</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe started it not knowing what the ending was going to be,\u201d Grant tells me, confessing that the chance to star alongside Sally Field was the \u201cinstant hook\u201d \u2013 even though he had only seen scripts for two of the 10 episodes, written by Jason Segel, better known for his work in front of the camera. He calls it \u201ca blind leap of faith\u201d but the nature of his work has required him to do this often.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had the most extreme experiences,\u201d he answers when I bring up a complaint I\u2019ve often heard from actors: that what you sign on for isn\u2019t necessarily what you see on screen. He tells me about the good: the underdog project that was <em>Withnail &amp; I</em>, a film that shouldn\u2019t have been a hit on paper (\u201cAll the odds were stacked against it\u201d) yet remains the role he\u2019s most associated with. Then he tells me about the bad: playing the villain in notorious 1991 flop <em>Hudson Hawk</em>, a failed summertime re-team for <em>Die Hard</em> producer Joel Silver and star Bruce Willis.</p> <p>\u201cI sat with [co-star] Andie MacDowell and our agents when we were encouraged to go and see a screening of it before its premiere, and Andie and I both looked at each other simultaneously and said, \u2018We will never work again\u2019,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cSo, with the best intentions, I think it\u2019s like internet dating or any dating: you go into something hoping you\u2019re going to fall in love and it\u2019s going to work out \u2026 and then, of course, it\u2019s a living nightmare!\u201d</p> <p>He tells me that, on the set of the ill-fated action comedy, Willis asked him why English actors so readily take on roles that are \u201cunsympathetic or deviant\u201d, a question that struck him as odd, given that Willis admitted he would \u201cnever do that\u201d. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s the definition of a movie star, which is what he is, as opposed to a character actor, which is what I am,\u201d he muses. \u201cIt just clearly divided the line between what your career choice or trajectory is.\u201d</p> <p>He jokingly responds to my comment about embracing versatility by calling himself a \u201cwhore for hire\u201d, but his varied resum\u00e9, which encompasses everything from <em>Gosford Park</em> to <em>Spice World</em><em> </em>to <em>Logan </em>to <em>Girls</em>, has also given him an insight into the less glamorous side of the industry. \u201cI\u2019ve got an ever-lengthening list of things on my iPad,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIt details where on every production there is some new experience where somebody\u2019s either tried to fuck you over or change something or come up with a new ploy to shaft you. You can never keep up because people are very inventive!\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not something that\u2019s abated with age and experience, and Grant recently traded war stories with Sally Field during downtime on the set of their new show (\u201c... in the way that, I suppose, soldiers show their battle scars\u201d). He also tries to follow his <em>Can You Ever Forgive Me?</em> co-star Melissa McCarthy\u2019s rule of ensuring everyone he works with doesn\u2019t have \u201ca reputation for being an arsehole\u201d, which isn\u2019t always possible.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I encounter cruelty or a real lack of consideration or rudeness from people, I will do everything to either avoid them or expose them,\u201d he adds, telling me a story of dressing down a fellow actor who was \u201cnotoriously unpunctual\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3445ec4781dff44392705794498149a075943da4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3445ec4781dff44392705794498149a075943da4/0_0_3000_2360/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul McGann and Richard E Grant in Withnail & I\" width=\"1000\" height=\"787\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Paul McGann in Withnail &amp; I in 1987.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Grant is known for his interest in the sex lives of others (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/17743056-2f1f-11e9-8744-e7016697f225\">he once said</a> that his first question when taking on a character is related to their bedroom activities) so when I tell him my most recent first date was 30 minutes late, he tells me not to shag him until he shows up on time, not a bad rule. His carnal curiosity has often got him into trouble (\u201cI\u2019m from Swaziland so people would just say \u2018How fucking dare you?\u2019 or \u2018Shut up\u2019\u201d) but it\u2019s also helped intimate him within an industry that often keeps people at arm\u2019s length. On the set of <em>The Player</em>, Susan Sarandon taught Grant a \u201cpop theory\u201d, he says, about the importance of attracting someone with a complimenting combination of masculine and feminine qualities, a way of understanding people that he still subscribes to now.</p> <p>Grant says he enjoys embracing the feminine, something that wasn\u2019t always easy growing up in a \u201csport-orientated and heavy-drinking culture\u201d in south-east Africa. His father was an abusive alcoholic but Grant discovered at 16 that he was allergic to alcohol and found himself getting involved in school plays instead. The resistance he encountered from some at the time (he says the reaction to his teenage desire to act was equivalent to him saying he was going to be \u201ca purple-haired hairdresser\u201d) granted him a certain resilience. This is something he\u2019s utilised throughout a career of rejection, and also last year when he came under fire on social media after his enthusiasm for the star-studded awards circuit struck some as disingenuous.</p> <p>\u201cIt was unfettered wide-eyed-in-Babylon delight,\u201d he insists. \u201cI think because of where I grew up and the circumstances in which I grew up, the [fact that the] good fortune that has come my way has happened in the twilight zone of my life career-wise is so beyond anything that I could have imagined that I can\u2019t help but feel celebratory about it. So it\u2019s undiluted delight \u2013 and that pisses some people off because they think it can\u2019t be genuine. I\u2019m not a good enough actor to do that.\u201d</p> <p>There were also accusations of hypocrisy at the end of last year after Grant was quoted in the <em><a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/richard-e-grant-interview-the-new-star-wars-villain-on-oscars-and-late-life-fame-7t3h8ngdf\">Sunday Times</a></em> as saying straight actors shouldn\u2019t take on gay roles, just after he played a gay man in <em>Can You Ever Forgive Me?</em> and as he was shooting the big screen adaptation of hit West End musical<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/26/everybodys-talking-about-jamie-review-fizzingly-fresh-west-end-musical\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/26/everybodys-talking-about-jamie-review-fizzingly-fresh-west-end-musical\">Everybody\u2019s Talking about Jamie</a></em>, playing a gay drag queen. \u201cI\u2019m glad you brought that up,\u201d he says. His remark was in the context of <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/darren-criss-gay-characters\">comments</a> made by actor Darren Criss, who \u201cmade a very public grandstand\u201d about never playing a gay character again after \u201cbeing given every award going\u201d for his role in <em>The Assassination of Gianni Versace</em>. \u201cI said I think that you have to be very sensitive and aware that you are taking a role away from somebody, and you have to really justify why you are doing that but, of course, it was quoted and misquoted subsequently that only gay actors should play gay roles, which is not what I actually said. This is the way of the world \u2026 I then got trolled on the internet.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"433527b1821082aae531e00009de7855ee846914\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/433527b1821082aae531e00009de7855ee846914/0_0_3504_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grant with Melissa McCarthy in Can You Ever Forgive Me?, the film for which he received an Oscar nomination.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grant with Melissa McCarthy in Can You Ever Forgive Me?, the film for which he received an Oscar nomination.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Fox Searchlight Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He is \u2013 perhaps predictably given the buoyant tone of his Instagram feed \u2013 far more focused on the positive side of social media and what\u2019s to come next. After our interview he was set to head to Atlanta to prep for a role in Disney+\u2019s Marvel show <em>Loki ,</em>and he also, hopes to return behind the camera to direct a secret project. His first film as director, the semi-autobiographical coming of age drama <em>Wah-Wah</em>, was something of a nightmarish experience, working with a producer he famously fell out with. \u201cI gave my published diaries about <em>Wah-Wah</em> to the producers of this film that are attached to it and I said \u2018Be warned because this is what my experience was first time round\u2019 and they said \u2018No no no this won\u2019t happen,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cTravel in hope, Benjamin!\u201d</p> <p>We start to wrap up, he prods gently to find out more about my dating situation (\u201cWhat are you attracted to? Masculine feminine or feminine masculine?\u201d) and we say our goodbyes, heading out into the then open streets of New York. Since isolation, Grant has been entertaining his Instagram followers with daily \u201cWithnail and Isolation\u201d videos, one of the few celebrities to have correctly judged the mood during the pandemic, avoiding anything overly earnest or self-obsessed, and just having a laugh instead. Perhaps one <em>Withnail</em> line resonates more than others: \u201cI think we\u2019ve been in here too long. I feel unusual. I think we should go outside.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>A proposed unity government deal involving Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and opposition leader, Benny Gantz, appears to be in jeopardy as initial progress stalls and a deadline this week looks set to be missed.</p> <p>The pair \u2013 who have battled for more than a year in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/israels-opposition-head-benny-gantz-wins-support-to-form-government\">three inconclusive elections</a> \u2013 had both expressed a desire to come to an understanding as the country faces the coronavirus pandemic. Talks to join forces and end the crippling political deadlock appeared to be in the final stages. One power-sharing deal would see them rotate the role of leader over a four-year term.</p> <p>However, last week Gantz\u2019s party, Blue and White, said that, after an \u201call-round agreement\u201d had been reached, Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party suddenly resurrected old demands about judicial appointments. Likud countered that it was Gantz who backed away at the last minute.</p> <p>Gantz\u2019s deadline to form a coalition government will expire on Monday, though Israel\u2019s president, Reuven Rivlin, may allow him two extra weeks. The president could equally hand the mandate to Netanyahu, although, like Gantz, he does not have the seats to form a majority.</p> <p>Local media speculated that Netanyahu might have \u201ctorpedoed\u201d the negotiations after polls showed his party could win a possible fourth election, which will be held if the stalemate continues.</p> <p>Gantz took a significant risk last month when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/benny-gantz-elected-israeli-speaker-signalling-deal-with-netanyahu\">went against senior members of his own party</a> to abort attempts to push through legislation to end Netanyahu\u2019s career in favour of restarting talks for a deal.</p> <p>Blue and White had threatened to introduce term-limits for prime ministers, and a ban on them serving while under indictment. Both scenarios would have ended Netanyahu\u2019s political career. He is Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader and is fighting three major corruption cases, including on charges of bribery and fraud. Netanyahu denies all the allegations.</p> <p>However, in a move that came as a surprise even to his allies, Gantz nominated himself and was elected speaker of parliament, apparently to shield Netanyahu from such bills.</p> <p>The plot twist cost Gantz more than half his Knesset members, who broke away, but the former head of the army argued that it was necessary to keep the possibility of a unity government alive.</p> <p>\u201cThese are unusual times and they call for unusual decisions. That\u2019s why I intend to explore the formation of a national emergency government,\u201d Gantz told the Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament.</p> <p>Israeli commentators, however, have suggested that Gantz, who entered politics less than two years ago, may have been too optimistic about Netanyahu, famed as a political magician, agreeing to share the top seat.</p> <p>\u201cGantz is not at all built to deal with such phenomena,\u201d Yossi Verter <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/elections/.premium-as-gantz-s-time-runs-out-netanyahu-no-longer-in-a-rush-to-form-emergency-gov-t-1.8752546\">wrote</a> in Haaretz newspaper. \u201cIn his naivety, he decided in one quick moment to jump into bed with Netanyahu without guarantees \u2013 and in doing so he tore apart his party. He tried to play \u2018fair\u2019 against a competitor for whom such a principle arouses nothing but deep contempt.\u201d</p>",

Tsai has spearheaded a swift and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/04/asia/taiwan-coronavirus-response-who-intl-hnk/index.html\">successful defence</a> to the pandemic; despite Taiwan\u2019s proximity to mainland China it has largely contained the virus and has just under 400 confirmed cases. It is so well prepared that it is <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/09/taiwan-is-exporting-its-coronavirus-successes-to-the-world/\">donating 10</a><a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/09/taiwan-is-exporting-its-coronavirus-successes-to-the-world/\">m masks</a> to the US and 11 European countries.</p> <p>New Zealand, led by Jacinda Ardern, is also a world leader in combating the virus. The country has had only one <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/09/asia/new-zealand-lessons-intl-hnk/index.html\">Covid-19 death so far</a>. That\u2019s partly due to geography and size: with under 5 million people, New Zealand\u2019s entire population is much smaller than New York\u2019s. Being an island state also gives it a distinct advantage. However, leadership is also a factor. New Zealand has implemented widespread testing and Ardern has responded to the crisis with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/clarity-and-compassion-what-australia-can-learn-from-new-zealands-coronavirus-response\">clarity and compassion</a>.</p> <p>Germany has been hit hard by coronavirus, but it has an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/world/europe/germany-coronavirus-death-rate.html\">exceptionally low mortality rate of around 1.6%</a>. (Italy\u2019s fatality rate is 12%; Spain, France and Britain\u2019s is 10%; China\u2019s is 4%; America\u2019s is 3%.) A number of factors feed into Germany\u2019s low death rates, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/germany-low-coronavirus-mortality-rate-puzzles-experts\">early and widespread testing</a> and a large number of intensive care beds. Again, however, the country\u2019s leadership plays a role. As one wag on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mhdksafa/status/1246822725886320640?s=20\">joked</a>: if you\u2019re asking why death rates are so low in Germany and so high in America, it\u2019s \u201cbecause their president used to be a quantum chemist and your president used to be a reality television host\u201d. Angela Merkel, who has a doctorate in quantum chemistry, is actually the chancellor not the president, but the sentiment still holds.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/30/823912064/the-danish-way-is-working-prime-minister-hints-at-a-gradual-reopening-for-april\">Denmark</a> (led by prime minister Mette Frederiksen) and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/world/europe/coronavirus-finland-masks.html\">Finland</a> (prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/09/finland-anoints-sanna-martin-34-as-worlds-youngest-serving-prime-minister\">Sanna Marin</a> is the head of a coalition whose four other parties are all led by women) are also doing noteworthy jobs in containing coronavirus.</p> <p>Correlation is obviously not causation. Being a woman doesn\u2019t automatically make you better at handling a global pandemic. Nor does it automatically <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/21/barack-obama-women-better-than-men-myths-leaders\">make you a better leader</a>; suggesting it does reinforces sexist and unhelpful ideas that women are innately more compassionate and cooperative.</p> <p>What is true, however, is that women generally have to be better in order to <em>become</em> leaders; we are held to far higher standards than men. Women are rarely able to fail up in the way men can; you have to be twice as good as a man in order to be taken half as seriously. You have to work twice as hard. With a few notable exceptions (*cough* Ivanka Trump *cough*), you\u2019ve got to be overqualified for a top job.</p> <p>A surplus of qualifications isn\u2019t exactly a problem Donald Trump has. America\u2019s response to the coronavirus crisis is arguably the worst in the world \u2013 although Britain also gets an honourable mention here. Instead of expertise, the Trump administration has led with ego. While thousands of Americans die, Trump <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/492084-trump-slams-wsj-for-failing-to-mention-ratings-in-critical-editorial\">tweets about his TV ratings</a>. Instead of cooperating, Trump is lashing out at the press and state leaders. It\u2019s hard to imagine Hillary Clinton responding to a crisis in this way without being immediately impeached. Which raises the question: are some men simply too emotional to be leaders?</p> <h2>Women using code words to escape domestic violence</h2> <p>There\u2019s been a huge spike in domestic violence around the world because of the Covid-19 lockdown. With help harder to access, people are finding creative workarounds. A new <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/europe/domestic-violence-coronavirus-lockdown-intl/index.html\">initiative in France</a> encourages people experiencing abuse to say a codeword (\u201cmask19\u201d) to a pharmacist at a drugstore to get help.

Both the deleted pages were accessed from online caches.</p> \n<p>Prof Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London, said the Chinese government had a heavy focus on how the evolution and management of the virus is perceived since the early days of the outbreak.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn terms of priority, controlling the narrative is more important than the public health or the economic fallout,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean the economy and public health aren\u2019t important.

It was <a href=\"http://www.most.gov.cn/jgdj/jcdt/202004/t20200408_152960.htm\">referenced</a> by the science and technology ministry shortly before the universities posted their orders. </p> \n<p>The Chinese government did not reply to a request for comment sent by the Guardian to the Chinese embassy in Washington.</p> \n<p>While the exact origin of the pandemic is still not certain, one commonly held hypothesis is that it began following an interaction between a human and an animal at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/how-did-the-coronavirus-start-where-did-it-come-from-how-did-it-spread-humans-was-it-really-bats-pangolins-wuhan-animal-market\">Huanan seafood \u201cwet market\u201d</a> in Wuhan.</p> \n<p>Scientists have said the virus probably originated in bats and then passed through an intermediary animal before infecting the first human.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/how-did-the-coronavirus-start-where-did-it-come-from-how-did-it-spread-humans-was-it-really-bats-pangolins-wuhan-animal-market\">How did coronavirus start and where did it come from? Was it really Wuhan's animal market?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Scientists believe the transmission was similar to that in the 2002 outbreak of Sars. Some criticism of China has focused on why the government did not shut down wet markets after the previous outbreaks of coronaviruses.</p> \n<p>Kevin Carrico, a senior research fellow of Chinese studies at Monash University, said he was not aware of any specific recent change to rules for academic research in China in connection to Covid-19, but the documents were generally consistent with efforts by China to control the narrative of the pandemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey are seeking to transform it from a massive disaster to one where the government did everything right and gave the rest of the world time to prepare,\u201d Carrico said. </p> \n<p>Carrico said those efforts had been evident in communications ranging from government pronouncements at the highest level to public sentiment on social media.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is a desire to a degree to deny realities that are staring at us in the face \u2026 that this is a massive pandemic that originated in a place that the Chinese government really should have cleaned up after Sars,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Around a month ago senior Chinese diplomats, officials and state media all publicly encouraged speculation that the new coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/conspiracy-theory-that-coronavirus-originated-in-us-gaining-traction-in-china\">could have come from outside the country</a>.

Brick House, the award-winning London bakery, is sharing a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B938Z6uA2cr/\">sourdough</a> masterclass on Instagram. It guides you through the whole process, from starting a sourdough mother to ready-to-eat baked loaf.</p> <h2><strong>C is for clay</strong></h2> <p>For a child-friendly, kitchen-table project, make your own air-dry clay from corn flour, water and bicarbonate of soda. In a pan, combine two cups of bicarbonate of soda with one cup of cornflour and 1.5 cups of cold water. Mix until smooth, then heat gently for five minutes until it has formed a ball. Transfer to a bowl, cover with a damp cloth and allow to cool completely before you start to shape the clay. Your shape or sculpture will take up to 48 hours to dry fully, then it can be painted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7b798a042d1cd6b3e9e6d334746db6f15993fd2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b798a042d1cd6b3e9e6d334746db6f15993fd2d/0_103_1772_3878/457..jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of man sitting on photo of a dandelion\" width=\"457\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration: Nishant Choksi/The Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Nishant Choksi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>D is for dandelions</strong></h2> <p>Edible<strong>, </strong>beautiful, useful \u2013 why banish dandelions when bees love the blooms and the seeds are manna to goldfinches? Give the weedkiller a rest and let your grass glow with yellow.</p> <h2><strong>\u2026 and deep decluttering</strong></h2> <p>Now is the perfect time for a satisfying declutter. This can be hard to do on your own, so if you are isolating with others, get them to hold up your broken tools/unworn shoes/old school books and ask: \u201cDo you need this?\u201d If you don\u2019t touch the object, you are more likely to get rid of it. Work in categories (books, toys, clothes, knick-knacks) and set aside things to be recycled or donated later.</p> <h2><strong>E is for envelopes</strong></h2> <p>Catch up on letters<strong>.</strong> Find the addresses of everyone you know who lives in a different part of the world/country and write letters or postcards. Get kids involved: decorate a set of blank postcards with pressed flowers \u2013 even nicer for the person who receives your letter.</p> <h2><strong>F is for food</strong></h2> <p>Turn your garden, balcony or windowsill into a productive patch. Self-sufficiency takes time and space you probably don\u2019t have, so focus on growing fresh, flavour-packed leaves: think tasty garnishes rather than a substitute for the supermarket.</p> <p>If you have a sunny windowsill, try sowing coriander and fenugreek seeds in a shallow indoor tray of compost, and harvest once the seedlings are around 3cm tall. Buy a three-tier sprouter from the <a href=\"https://www.organiccatalogue.com/products/3-tier-sprouter_783164\">Organic Gardening Catalogue</a> (\u00a329.99) to expand your options.</p> <p>Pea shoots are another super-easy windowsill crop that is big enough for small fingers to sow. Buy a box of dried peas, soak in warm water for a few hours, then sow into a tray of damp compost and cover with another 2cm of compost. Once the shoots reach 5-10cm long, snip above the lowest set of leaves and the plant will regrow for multiple harvests.

Anything over two years old can be shredded and discarded (tax-related paperwork such as payslips, P45s and P60s must be kept for at least 22 months from the end of the tax year to which they relate). Keep your new system slimline by opting for paperless billing.</p> <h2><strong>G is for garden centres</strong></h2> <p>All the spring plant shows \u2013 a major selling outlet for nurseries \u2013 are cancelled, which means there is stock that needs to be sold.

Start \u2013 or finish \u2013 hanging a gallery wall by digging out posters, prints, postcards, photos, children\u2019s drawings, or any memorabilia that makes you happy. Pinterest has heaps of gallery wall layout ideas, and there are online framers such as <a href=\"https://www.easy-frame.co.uk/\">Easy Frame</a>.</p> <h2><strong>H is for free houseplants</strong></h2> <p>Take an avocado stone, wrap it in damp kitchen roll and place in a clear plastic bag in a warm dark place \u2013 leave a small opening in the bag for air circulation. Check every few days, keeping the paper damp, and once the stone has cracked open and sprouted, pot in some damp houseplant compost, the top just proud of the surface. You will end up with a pretty foliage plant.</p> <h2><strong>\u2026 and homemade cleaning products</strong></h2> <p>Order a giant bottle of castile soap and make multipurpose surface spray cleaner, scented with your favourite essential oils. \u201cKids love getting involved in this,\u201d says blogger Hannah Bullivant, who has been making her own cleaning products for nearly a decade. \u201cIt\u2019s like making potions.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>I is for ikebana</strong></h2> <p>The Japanese art of flower arranging might be just the kind of mindful, minimalist, creative activity you need right now.

Remember to poke or drill holes in the base for drainage. Buy a paper potter (\u00a310.98 from the <a href=\"https://www.theplasticfreeshop.co.uk/useful-stuff/paper-potter-original\">Plastic Free Shop</a>) to make biodegradable pots for seeds.</p> <h2><strong>K is for kitchen cupboards</strong></h2> <p>Frugality and making food go further are key just now.

A mini reflector \u2013 a piece of card covered in aluminium foil and set behind a tray of seedlings \u2013 will help to bounce existing light in their direction.</p> <h2><strong>M is for mud kitchen</strong></h2> <p>For many parents, long weeks of full-time childcare stretch ahead: if you have a garden, balcony, back step or patio, a mud kitchen can eat up hours for younger children. An old table, a washing-up bowl and a few utensils are all you need for a bit of sensory play; but for something fancier, check out <a href=\"https://mudkitchens.co.uk/\">Mud Kitchens</a>.</p> <h2><strong>N is for notes</strong></h2> <p>If you have a garden, some areas are bound to lack spring cheer; could you brighten them up for next year with crocuses, add early tulips and daffodils, enliven bare tables with pots of grape hyacinths and irises? Yes, but will you remember come bulb-planting time? Make notes and take snaps of the relevant spots as an aide-memoire, and spring 2021 will be stunning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"359db559de284f11a36808110d10c3d81cbcaa69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/359db559de284f11a36808110d10c3d81cbcaa69/0_48_2953_2857/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of woman looking up at a photo of a rose\" width=\"1000\" height=\"967\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">R is for top dressing roses.

Ros Humphries, founder of the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thenaturaldyeworks/?hl=en\">Natural Dyeworks</a>, says: \u201cOnion skins are rich in tannins, so a good project for beginners. Wash your chosen fabric with a pH-neutral soap. Fill a large pan with water and add two large handfuls of onion skins. Simmer for an hour, then strain through a muslin cloth or tea towel. Wet your fabric, then immerse in the dye. Bring to just below simmer and \u2018cook\u2019 for up to an hour. Leave to cool overnight for the strongest shades. Expect warm yellows from brown onions and peachy pinks from red onions.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>P is for perennial vegetables</strong></h2> <p>Seedlings take up loads of room: perennial vegetables bypass the sowing stage and are low maintenance, too. Some sound exotic and aren\u2019t so easy to get hold of, such as Egyptian walking onions and sea beet; there is also the more familiar horseradish, Jerusalem artichoke and rhubarb. Some common garden perennials that are considered ornamental are also edible, including the young shoots of <em>Centranthus ruber</em> (red valerian) or of <em>Hosta sieboldii, </em>and the buds and flowers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jul/03/alys-fowler-day-lilies\">day lilies</a> (<em>Hemerocallis</em>). Remember, there are plenty of poisonous plants, too, so check the <a href=\"https://pfaf.org/user/Default.aspx\">Plants For </a><a href=\"https://pfaf.org/user/Default.aspx\">A Future</a> website for more unexpected garden edibles; or Martin Crawford\u2019s bible on the subject, <a href=\"https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/perennial-vegetables/\">How </a><a href=\"https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/perennial-vegetables/\">To Grow Perennial Vegetables</a>. </p> <h2><strong>Q is for quince</strong></h2> <p>The quince tree, <em>Cydonia oblonga, </em>is a must for foodie gardeners. The fruit is brilliant for pies, jellies and the Spanish quince paste membrillo \u2013 or eat them baked with a dollop of cream. The dwarf cultivars \u2018Leskovac\u2019 or Sibley\u2019s Patio Quince will both grow in a large pot on the patio and can be bought now.</p> <h2><strong>\u2026 and quilting</strong></h2> <p>Recycle your old clothes by stitching them into a patchwork quilt<strong>. </strong>Old T-shirts, unused ties, faded denim, favourite scarves \u2013 they will all work. Check out the website <a href=\"https://arrangewhateverpiecescomeyourway.com/\">ArrangeWhateverPiecesComeYourWay.com</a> for inspiration.</p> <h2><strong>R is for roses</strong></h2> <p>If your roses put on a poor show last summer, give them a boost with a top dressing of fertiliser such as <a href=\"https://www.gardening-naturally.com/organic-rose-food\">Vitax Organic </a><a href=\"https://www.gardening-naturally.com/organic-rose-food\">Rose </a><a href=\"https://www.gardening-naturally.com/organic-rose-food\">Food</a> sprinkled on to the soil around the plant, then hoed in.

Whether it\u2019s a meal for one or a family of six, lay the table to the max.\u201d She suggests dusting off the best china and glasses, making calligraphy place names and menu cards, and arranging individual flower stems in bud jars down the table in little groups. \u201cIf you can\u2019t get flowers, herbs in pots will do the job nicely. Make iced biscuits and use them as part of the place setting.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>U is for umbellifers</strong></h2> <p>If you see a plant with umbrella-like clusters of tiny flowers that look like a landing pad, it\u2019s probably a member of the umbellifer family, which includes cow parsley and wild carrot. Parasitoid wasps love feeding on the flowers, and these are important predators who keep down common pests such as aphids and caterpillars. Bellifers often have lacy foliage that provides spots for insects to cool off and shelter, too. Sow herb umbellifers such as coriander, dill, parsley and fennel among vegetables to help keep crops healthy.</p> <h2><strong>\u2026 and upcycling</strong></h2> <p>Paint-stripping, sanding down, priming and repainting: changing the colour of wooden furniture or fittings is the perfect job for isolation. But before you paint an old chair blue or brighten the inside of your kitchen cupboards with glossy yellow, check out the design website Remodelista\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.remodelista.com/posts/expert-advice-how-to-paint-furniture/\">advice on painting furniture</a> (which suggests you start by downloading an audio book). If you feel experimental, they also have ideas for achieving <a href=\"https://www.remodelista.com/posts/how-to-paint-distress-furniture-diy-expert-advice/\">finishes such as crackle glazes and feign</a><a href=\"https://www.remodelista.com/posts/how-to-paint-distress-furniture-diy-expert-advice/\"> patinas</a>.</p> <h2><strong>V is for vertical</strong></h2> <p>If every flat surface in your home is taken up with plants, it\u2019s time to move up. If you don\u2019t want to drill holes in the ceiling to hang them, repurposed hat stands, freestanding clothes racks and even drinks trolleys will make flexible, space-saving digs for your plant.</p> <h2><strong>\u2026 and vinegar</strong></h2> <p>Mix equal parts of white vinegar and water in a spray bottle and clean your windows inside and out. Talking of windows, wash the curtains, too, and any other removable fabric covers (pillow, mattress, cushion) that have evaded the laundry pile of late.</p> <h2><strong>W is for wildflower hour</strong></h2> <p>If you can\u2019t go outside to smell the flowers, check out <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=@wildflower_hour&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Esearch\">@wildflower_hour </a>on Twitter: every Sunday night from 8-9pm is a bonanza of native plant pictures and chat.</p> <h2><strong>\u2026 and WFH</strong></h2> <p>If the novelty of working from home is wearing off, check your desk is positioned in front of a window: natural light and views will soothe, as will a plant and a jug of water (you might forget to rehydrate at home).

Plant a few houseleek rosettes in a shallow dish of gritty compost or in a south-facing windowbox to enjoy all year round.</p> <h2><strong>\u2026 and xylography</strong></h2> <p>Xylography is the art of carving shapes on wood for printing. Whether you carve a design into wood, lino or a potato, block printing is a soothing activity to do alone or with children. Textile designer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-FkijmFw1K/\">Molly Mahon</a> suggests: \u201cStart with a simple pattern, such as a star, to get you going. Another good idea, if you can get out into nature, is to draw round a leaf \u2013 this shape makes a great printing pattern.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Y is for yellow leaves</strong></h2> <p>Lavishing all your spare time on caring for houseplants is no bad thing, but don\u2019t overdo it with the watering can.</p> <p>Waterlogged roots may not be visible, but yellowing leaves are an early warning sign that all is not well below the surface. Counterintuitively, wilting can also be a sign of overwatering. Take the plant out of its pot, cut away any slimy roots and repot into fresh houseplant potting mix, making sure there are plenty of drainage holes.</p> <p>For plants with leathery leaves such as monstera (Swiss cheese plant) and philodendrons, take a damp cloth and gently wipe the surface of each leaf: furry leaves such as African violets and spiny cacti can be cleaned gently with a dry, clean, soft makeup brush or paintbrush.</p> <h2><strong>Z is for zinnias</strong></h2> <p>If you would love to see really vibrant colour in the garden this summer, zinnias will lift your spirits. Native to Mexico, they come in many glorious hues and are easy to grow here. They also make stunning cut flowers. <a href=\"https://www.chilternseeds.co.uk/\">Chiltern Seeds</a> has a great range of seeds, or buy them as <a href=\"https://www.suttons.co.uk/Gardening/Flower-Plants/All-Flower-Plants/Zinnia-Plants---Zahara_MH2995.htm#252175\">plug plants</a> from Suttons.</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>Workers laid off due to the coronavirus crisis and applying for universal credit for the first time may be surprised to learn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-universal-credit-lockdown-claimants\">how little it pays and how difficult the process can be</a>.</p> <p>That was the stark warning from benefits experts this week as many people embark on their first ever benefits claim.</p> <p>More than 1 million people have applied for universal credit in the past month. The result has been huge waits to talk to benefits staff on the phone. So if you are about to claim for the first time, how do you do it, and what can you expect?</p> <h2><strong>How to claim</strong></h2> <p>Anna Stevenson, a welfare and benefits specialist at the financial charity Turn2Us, says the first thing new claimants need to do is to assemble all their financial data, and then use a benefits calculator \u2013 there is one on the <a href=\"https://benefits-calculator.turn2us.org.uk/AboutYou\">Turn2us website</a> \u2013 which will give a good indication of the sum payable.</p> <p>While people do not need a national insurance number to claim, details of rent and any outstanding earnings and mortgage costs will be required.</p> <p>The biggest bar to many will be the fact that anyone with savings of \u00a316,000 or more is not eligible to make a claim. They can only apply for jobseeker\u2019s allowance (JSA) of \u00a374.35 a week, and will receive no help with their rent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb8cb6d3b1c2590cf4d0400aeea7a5fab7173a18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb8cb6d3b1c2590cf4d0400aeea7a5fab7173a18/0_0_5123_3415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Government and NHS advert for claiming universal credit in Birmingham city centre\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The coronavirus crisis has led to empty high streets and job losses.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Kemp/In Pictures via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All applicants are expected to file their claim <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit/how-to-claim?step-by-step-nav=7c08bbbf-a1ca-4cf5-850d-d9f2c796c750\">online</a>, or via the helpline. At the start, claimants must verify their identity \u2013 so have your passport or driving licence to hand.</p> <p>One of the big stumbling blocks has been that large numbers of claimants have been unable to do this online, often because they moved house recently or because some of their documents do not match up. It has lead to reports of people spending many hours on hold. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said this week it aimed to have a simpler ID system in place in the next few days.</p> <p>Once over that hurdle, applicants must input details of any income they are yet to be paid, any savings they have, the income of other members of their household (spouse or partner plus any adult children), and their housing costs, such as rent or outstanding mortgage.</p> <p>Problems can arise when trying to make an appointment to have the claim processed, says Stevenson. \u201cUniversal credit claimants have to make this appointment within 30 days of completing their applications and, for the claim to be approved, the interview must happen. Previously, this took place at the jobcentre but this is now being done over the phone. Again, people have been reporting that it is impossible to get through.\u201d</p> <p>The DWP accepts there have been long waiting times, and said on Thursday it was ending the need to call up. Instead, it said, its staff will be \u201cproactively calling claimants if they need to check any of the information provided as part of the claim, as well as messaging them on their online journal to confirm details\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>What will I get?</strong></h2> <p>It is difficult to generalise as each person\u2019s calculation is based on their household income, how much rent they pay, number of children etc \u2013 see the scenarios below.</p> <p>However, a single person over 25 will receive \u00a3410 a month, or about \u00a394 a week basic benefit, provided they have no other income.</p> <p>An unemployed couple on universal credit will receive \u00a3594 a month. If they have two children they will be paid a further \u00a3516 a month, provided the first child was born before April 2017.</p> <p>They will also receive help with their rent \u2013 formerly called housing benefit \u2013 although in many cases it will cover only 70-80% of what they pay their landlord.</p> <p>Stevenson says this is because the maximum rent that is claimable payable is set locally, and varies according to the local housing allowance. That rate is set at the lower 30% of rents in each area of the UK.</p> <p>Claimants are also entitled to help with their council tax, although again this will not always cover the full amount. This has to be claimed direct from your local council.</p> <h2><strong>Can I get help with my mortgage?</strong></h2> <p>This will come as a shock to many. If you are applying for universal credit and do not have any earnings, you can receive 2.61% of your outstanding mortgage made as a monthly payment, but this does not become payable until you have been claiming benefits and not earning for nine months.</p> <p>Someone with an outstanding mortgage of \u00a3150,000 would receive \u00a3326 a month (2.61% of 150,000 divided by 12) after nine months. However, this is a loan that accrues interest and has to be paid back, either before or when the house is sold.</p> <h2><strong>When will I get the payments, and can I get an advance?</strong></h2> <p>Universal credit is paid monthly in arrears and there is a five- to six-week wait for the payments to start. Those needing money immediately can claim an interest-free loan called an Advance within the first month, three days after filing the claim.</p> <h2><strong>Is there any other help available?</strong></h2> <p>Local authorities can sometimes help bridge the gap between the sum offered by universal credit to pay rent and the actual rent paid, known as discretionary housing payments. There is a limited amount of money available, so councils usually give preference to applications showing the greatest need.</p> <p>Turn2Us says claimants could also be eligible for support from almost 2,000 charitable funds that offer grants to help people struggling to get by. The <a href=\"http://www.turn2us.org.uk/get-support/Benefits-and-Coronavirus%5Dwebsite\">website</a> will signpost people towards this help, or you can call its helpline on 0808 802 2000.</p> <h2><strong>My income has dropped dramatically but I still have some work, can I apply too?</strong></h2> <p>Yes. Dan Rust, a benefits expert at Turquoise Training, says universal credit is also there to help workers whose hours and income have been reduced as a result of a partial shutdown.</p> <p>\u201cIf you are getting statutory sick pay because you are self-isolating, or if you are doing fewer hours at work, you should claim universal credit to top up your income,\u201d he says.</p> <h2><strong>I am (was) self-employed, can I apply?</strong></h2> <p>Yes, and you should, even if you expect help to come from the government\u2019s self-employed scheme. The government has also removed the floor on earnings that it previously used to limit payouts to those earning below the minimum wage from their self-employment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d0069774be8e97d72e037d83b102985d577e70b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0069774be8e97d72e037d83b102985d577e70b2/0_356_8260_4956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A family at home\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claimants may be eligible for support from charitable funds that offer grants to help people struggling to get by.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andriy Popov/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>How much can claimants expect to get?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Family with both parents working, but one has lost income</strong></p> <p>A manager is laid off after the owner shut his restaurant. He is 35 and married to a nurse who earns \u00a324,000 a year. They have two children, aged nine and seven, and a \u00a3600-per-month mortgage. They have savings of \u00a38,000.</p> <p>The nurse will still receive her net pay of \u00a31,663, while he will get universal credit payments of \u00a3351 per month, or \u00a381 a week. But any help with the mortgage will come only after nine months of not working. </p> <p><strong>Self-employed freelance worker, lost nearly all earnings</strong></p> <p>A freelance (self-employed) camera operator who used to make films at Pinewood Studios still receives \u00a3150 a month in royalties, but all other work has dried up. He lives alone in a rented two-bedroom house in St Albans, for which he pays \u00a31,400 a month.</p> <p>He will receive only \u00a3798 towards his housing costs and a total universal credit payment of \u00a31,058 per month. But this leaves him with a total income significantly less than his rent.</p> <p><strong>Self-employed consultant, 55, lost all earnings</strong><strong> but has savings</strong></p> <p>A self-employed management consultant now has no work. He has paid off his mortgage and he and his wife have Isa savings of \u00a360,000.</p> <p>Unfortunately, he is not entitled to any help. Their savings are too high to apply for universal credit, and he is not eligible for JSA, because he is self-employed. Had he been an employee, he would have got \u00a374.35 a week JSA.</p> <p><strong>Single person, 22, lost pub job</strong><strong> and has moved back in with parents</strong></p> <p>This person had a short-term contract but has been laid off from his job in a pub, and has no income. He does not pay rent to his parents, so will receive the basic \u00a3343 a month.</p> <p><strong>Laid-off mobile phone salesman whose wife works </strong><strong>at a supermarket</strong></p> <p>He has no work, while she earns \u00a31,100 a month net. They have three children aged six, nine and 11. They pay rent of \u00a31,500 a month in Manchester.</p> <p>They will receive only \u00a3723 a month towards their rent, meaning he will receive a total universal credit payment of \u00a31,561 per month, a little over their rent commitments.</p> <p><strong>An estate agent who used to earn \u00a350,000</strong></p> <p>He has been laid off. His partner earns \u00a340,000 gross in sales and is still being paid 100% by her employer. She has \u00a320,000 in savings; he has \u00a31,000. Their mortgage is \u00a31,100 a month.</p> <p>Again, he is not eligible for universal credit as their joint savings are too high. With two years of NI contributions, all he can claim is the new-style JSA of \u00a374.35 per week, for 26 weeks. Once their savings fall below \u00a316,000 he can claim universal credit.</p> <p><strong>Single person over 25</strong><strong> who lives in a shared flat</strong><strong> in east London.</strong></p> <p>He has been laid off so there is no income. He pays \u00a3450 a month in rent, inclusive of all bills and council tax, for his flatshare. He has savings of \u00a32,000, which is dwindling fast.</p> <p>He will be eligible for the shared accommodation rate for housing costs, which is up to \u00a3591 per month, and in total will receive \u00a3860 per month.</p> <p><em>Figures supplied by Dan Rust, a benefits expert</em><em> at Turquoise Training.

  "<p>The first person confirmed to have tested positive for the coronavirus in the US by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was a resident of Snohomish county, Washington.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/us-rural-hospitals-coronavirus-crisis-face-shutdowns\">Coronavirus threatens survival of US rural hospitals on frontlines of crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That was on 21 January. In the weeks that have followed, the state, which has a population of more than 7.5 million people, has seen over 9,000 confirmed cases, including 421 deaths.</p> <p>Washington\u2019s governor, Jay Inslee, has closed schools, ordered a halt to all elective surgeries and issued a stay-home mandate, which involves a ban on all gatherings and the closure of all businesses, except grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations and other essential companies. Last week, he extended that order to 4 May, saying that was \u201cabsolutely the soonest we possibly could achieve our ends to keep our loved ones safe.\u201d</p> <p>But though the path back to \u201cnormal\u201d life is still some way off, the state\u2019s early and comprehensive response looks to be flattening the curve of coronavirus infections. With the worsening of the financial crisis brought on by the public health emergency, that has prompted the questions: when, and how, could this end?</p> <p>Dr Anthony Fauci, America\u2019s leading expert on infectious diseases, recently explained that it will be clear the outbreak is nearing its conclusion in the US when the number of new infections is approaching almost zero and the number of deaths is not far behind.</p> <p>\u201cI believe that in a few months, hopefully, that we\u2019ll get it under control enough that it won\u2019t be as frightening as it is now, but it will not be an absent threat,\u201d he told the New York Times.</p> <p>Washington saw the initial outbreak of the virus in the US and, after the infection struck a nursing home in the state, reported the country\u2019s highest numbers of cases and deaths for weeks. But the state has since moved far behind hotspot states like New York, which has a far greater population of almost 20 million. Today, Washington state has the 11th-highest number of cases in the US, according to the CDC.</p> <p>A projection from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, an independent population health research center at UW Medicine, shows that Washington hit its peak in coronavirus deaths 11 days ago, with 24 fatalities. In contrast, New York\u2019s peak is projected to hit this week.</p> <p>Washington\u2019s low numbers can be attributed to the simple fact that its cities are less dense than those in states like New York. Its communities may also be following social distancing measures more closely.</p> <p>But officials also tested and found cases of coronavirus early, then quickly proceeded to ramp up preparedness, explained Hilary Godwin, dean of the University of Washington school of public health.</p> <p>\u201cOur hospitals have been preparing, building up capacity,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce we got to the point where we had to do social distancing because the number of cases was so great, we were really well positioned and were able to roll those things out really systematically.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Scott Lindquist, Washington state\u2019s epidemiologist for communicable diseases, said officials are paying particularly close attention to the percentage of people evaluated who test positive for Covid-19.</p> <p>He explained that at the beginning of this outbreak, the state was seeing 3% of people tested test positive, but as of Wednesday last week, that had increased to at least 7%. He said over one or two weeks, he would want to see the average stay consistently below 7%, as that would make it clear the numbers are trending down and thus the situation is improving.</p> <p>Lindquist said officials would also want to see a clear trend that shows the percentage of hospitalizations for people with corona-like illnesses and the number of deaths decreasing. These measures would offer a very clear indication about how much coronavirus is still in the community, he said. Although hospitalizations have been increasing, deaths have been staying fairly steady.</p> <p>Given these current trends, how much time could it take the state to get to a point when it would seriously consider easing social distancing restrictions?</p> <p>\u201cI definitely would say it\u2019s not days,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s weeks to months. But again, if things turn around very quickly, we\u2019re talking just a couple weeks.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4826fc1d8a0400b01505f4e2a1e85e6756e9e7b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4826fc1d8a0400b01505f4e2a1e85e6756e9e7b2/0_119_4434_2660/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jay Inslee has extended the stay-home order until 4 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jay Inslee has extended the stay-home order until 4 May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ted S Warren/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More than a third of the cases in Washington have been reported in King county, which includes Seattle.</p> <p>According to a recent study conducted by the Institute for Disease Modeling, a private research institute in Bellevue, Washington, King county has seen a significant decrease in virus transmissions, probably due to strict social distancing measures.</p> <p>The researchers found that in late February each infected individual in the county was spreading the virus to an average of two or three other people. By 18 March, that number had been essentially cut in half, with people on average infecting 1.4 additional people.</p> <p>But, of course, in order to actually see a drop in new cases, on average each individual with coronavirus would need to infect less than one other person.</p> <p>Godwin said when making a decision about social distancing restrictions, it\u2019s not necessarily a matter of getting the number of new cases and deaths down to zero.</p> <p>The trick is to get that number down low enough so that \u201cwe would be more like we were at the early phase of the epidemic, when the health department could do contact tracing for each case and could make sure anyone who got infected was self-quarantined\u201d, she said.</p> <p>However, Godwin said if Washington were to get the virus under control and removed its stay-home mandate, a \u201csecond wave\u201d of infections could still occur.</p> <p>Godwin said it may be a matter of Washington officials letting up for a little bit or releasing some constraints and then having to simply see how things go. But she warned that different virus timelines across US states could hamper efforts, especially if people from states that have not contained the virus continue to travel domestically.</p> <p>Dr Jeff Duchin, health officer for public health, Seattle and King county, said during a recent press conference that for the Seattle area or any community to transition out of comprehensive social distancing measures, there needs to be widespread availability of testing with very rapid turnaround time, and a robust healthcare system that is both heavily monitored and has the bandwidth to care for the sick.</p> <p>The severe lack of testing across the US is regarded as one of the biggest failures of the Trump administration\u2019s often confused response to the arrival of the pandemic on its shores. Technical flaws in early tests developed by the CDC set the country back weeks. And though private companies are now running thousands of tests a day, they cannot keep up with demand, and vital supplies for mass testing, such as swabs, remain critically low.</p> <p>But between the state\u2019s public health laboratory and the lab at the University of Washington in Seattle, experts say there is plenty of capacity for testing. The big limitation is that medical workers do not have adequate personal protective equipment for obtaining samples, explained Lindquist.</p> <p>\u201cBut there are some promising new developments where we can have patients obtain their own sample in their car with a nasal swab,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/who-cited-human-transmission-risk-in-january-despite-trump-claims\">WHO cited human transmission risk in January, despite Trump claims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Duchin also said there should also ideally be proven treatments available and possibly a vaccine, although that is also very unlikely to be available in the near future.</p> <p>\u201cWe are constantly reassessing this strategy and trying to understand if and when it is advisable to change our strategy, to relax some of these measures if possible in a way that would allow our healthcare system to continue to treat all those who need healthcare and not overwhelm that system and allow us to get back to our usual lives as soon as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see that in the next month.\u201d</p> <p>Mike Faulk, spokesman for the governor\u2019s office, said the decision to transition back to \u201cnormal\u201d life will ultimately come down to a judgment call.</p> <p>\u201cEven when you make that call you don\u2019t necessarily know that the disease is done or on a permanently downward track,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the most informed judgment you can make at the end of the day.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 13 April 2020 to remove an inaccurate reference to California as an example of a \u201chotspot\u201d state for coronovirus cases.</p>",

  "<p>Last month, as the reality of life under lockdown began to sink in, I asked my family if they had any particular concerns. Without hesitation, my eldest, who is 16, asked: \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you normal?\u201d This was day one of no school, and she was right. I wasn\u2019t normal; nothing about this situation was normal. I really struggled to find any sort of equilibrium for a long time. What helped us was implementing a \u201csubmarine\u201d routine, whereby the day is strictly portioned up, as it is in the locked-down conditions of the submariner, starting with a 7am reveille on weekdays. And in among the fear, panic and worry (most of my family is in Italy, and my mother, like so many elderly parents, thinks the rules don\u2019t apply to her) there have come pockets of calm, new normality and even small shards of joy. But still, the questions haven\u2019t stopped. These are the three that readers have been asking me the most over the last few weeks.</p> <h2>How can I hold space for my own worries regarding Covid-19 without it affecting my children? Is it possible to avoid lying to them that everything is fine, and let them know that I\u2019m worried, without overwhelming them?</h2> <p>It\u2019s a huge task. I think we have to accept it is going to affect them, but we can try to control how much. In these extreme times, we\u2019re going to get a lot of things wrong as parents. When you are stretched emotionally, it\u2019s hard to be even \u201cgood enough\u201d at times. This is a huge learning curve in acceptance: of ourselves, others, the situation.</p> <p>Child and adolescent psychotherapist Rachel Melville-Thomas (<a href=\"https://childpsychotherapy.org.uk/\" title=\"\">childpsychotherapy.org.uk</a>) explained to me that we need to recreate the \u201c\u2018pegs\u2019, the natural markers that children have in their usual life, such as getting to school, having break time, eating lunch, talking to friends.

Always remember the golden rule with children: listen to the question and answer just the question asked, factually, calmly and age-appropriately. It\u2019s OK to say you don\u2019t know. You don\u2019t have to have the answer to everything: no one does at the moment.</p> <p>Older children and teenagers will be able to see or hear the news, but they might hide their worries. Melville-Thomas recommended asking them, \u201cHow are your friends dealing with this at the moment?\u201d Coming at it via a third person may open up a bigger conversation.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever restrictions you had on their phones and social media before, keep them,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd we all react more badly to news at night so, ideally, no screens in their bedrooms.\u201d Everyone needs a news break.

Do this either on the phone or a family Skype session. \u201cYou can say, \u2018We need to talk about this for, say, 20 minutes, then we can talk about something else.\u2019 But approach it by saying, \u2018If any of us were to die, or get seriously ill, what do we want?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Things to think about, Mannix said, include: \u201cIf I can\u2019t have the funeral that I would like, what should my family do as a form of commemoration once such things are allowed?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Make sure family members can use a smartphone/Skype and have a tablet and charger to use if they have to go to hospital</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The last conversations that Mannix sees on deathbeds come down to three messages: I love you, I\u2019m sorry, or thank you. So if there are people you want to say these things to, do that now. I know this is quite scary, but as Mannix says, \u201cWhen we are dealing with people at the end of their lives, the messages [they give to those left behind] are so important for people to carry into their grief and bereavement.\u201d</p> <p>Another thing to talk about is what to do if any of us become very seriously ill. Mannix explained: \u201cTo decide whether a ventilator is the right treatment, intensive-care practitioners will look at a person\u2019s ability to recover. They may ask loved ones if the patient would agree to be on a ventilator; if they would want to be saved even if the quality of life [afterwards] is not one that they would value. The doctor needs to make a medical decision partly based on what\u2019s possible but, because we won\u2019t be well enough to discuss it, our families need to know what matters most to us.\u201d</p> <p>On a practical level, make sure family members know how to use a smartphone/Skype and have a tablet, charger and cables (all name-labelled) to use if they have to go to hospital. You may not be able to visit in person, and if you want to stay in touch, there may not be enough tech in wards to go round.</p> <p>None of this is easy, Mannix admitted, but it may open the door to an important conversation we have all avoided until now.</p> <p>The bereavement charity Cruse (<a href=\"http://cruse.org.uk/\" title=\"\">cruse.org.uk</a>) is a great resource if people are bereaved, and has lots of useful, Covid-19-specific information online.</p> <h2>We live in a small house. How can we all rub along together for the next however many weeks? We\u2019re spending way more time together than usual and clashing over parenting styles.</h2> <p>A routine, as detailed in my first answer, is really important. You may even have to implement a bathroom rota for ablutions. What we have to remember, says family and couples therapist Chris Mills, is that \u201ccaptivity is not natural for us. So if we are reactive or stroppy, it\u2019s the tensions created by being forced together. We\u2019re designed to nest together and come together, but also to have freedom of movement and interaction with others.\u201d</p> <p>Mills recommends looking for \u201cways of keeping a distance, of having headspace\u201d from other members of the family (I can\u2019t stress enough how important boundaries are in these enforced conditions). Consider either taking your state-approved daily exercise separately if you can, or having time apart in different areas. Under strain, we can become highly volatile, and may explode over things we would previously have laughed at or brushed aside. Even talking about this, and acknowledging it, can help (saying sorry also really matters).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/03/how-can-i-shift-some-of-mental-load-of-family-life-on-to-my-husband\">How can I shift some of the mental load of family life on to my husband?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another useful thing to try, advised Mills, is, if possible, to ask \u201cwhat each family member wants to achieve that day\u201d. This allows some flexibility within a routine, and takes into account daily moods and rhythms. Some days, for example, your partner may feel more able to take on responsibilities than you; on those days, maybe you can negotiate more \u201cyou\u201d time.</p> <p>As for differing parenting styles, Mills advises, \u201cIn this situation, nobody\u2019s good or bad. It\u2019s not about one person winning or losing, but you do have to find a way \u2013 at least while on lockdown \u2013 of provisionally agreeing so that there\u2019s a system in place to get through this.

  "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/anne-tyler\">Anne Tyler</a>\u2019s UK tour for her latest novel became an early victim of the coronavirus, and her publisher announced that the 78-year-old would be conducting all media interviews by phone from the safety of her home in Baltimore, Tyler felt some relief, but mainly she felt guilt. She is one of the world\u2019s most acclaimed modern novelists, winner of both a Pulitzer (for <em>Breathing Lessons</em>, 1988) and the National Book Critics Circle award (for <em>The Accidental Tourist</em>, 1995, which was turned into an Oscar-winning film) and a finalist for the Man Booker (<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/04/a-spool-of-blue-thread-anne-tyler-review\">A Spool of Blue Thread</a></em>, 2015) and the Women\u2019s prize for fiction (<em>Ladder of Years</em> from 1995, and <em>A Spool of Blue Thread</em>). But until 2012, she maintained a silence as assiduous as that of Thomas Pynchon or JD Salinger. She never liked \u2013 and still doesn\u2019t, but needs must in today\u2019s world \u2013 talking about how she does what she does, because that leads to self-consciousness, which is never good for creativity.</p> <p>So she was \u201ckind of relieved\u201d when the tour was cancelled. \u201cBut I remember I used to pray the school would burn down before a math test the next day. Yet if it had actually burned down I would have felt <em>so</em> guilty. So now I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Oh dear, be careful what you wish for!\u2019\u201d she says.</p> <p>Phone interviews are generally frustrating, a mess of missed connections and awkward interruptions. But Tyler has a manner that is as open and engaging as her prose, her conversation punctuated by charming anachronisms such as \u201cbestir\u201d and \u201calas\u201d, and it soon feels as if I know her as well as I know her brilliantly drawn characters. As I, too, am now working from home I start by apologising for the background noise of children and dogs. \u201cOh I love to hear children and dogs! That sounds good to me. I love normal life,\u201d she says.</p> <p>For the past half-century, Tyler has been the pre-eminent novelist of normal life. She is famously good at summing up a character in a precise line (\u201cShe had not grown fuller or softer with age. She was like certain supermarket vegetables that turn from green to withered without ever ripening\u201d \u2013 from <em>Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant</em>, 1982), but twice she tells me she is \u201cno good at plot, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed\u201d. It\u2019s true that no one would mistake aTyler novel for a John Grisham, but no one can match her evocation of the moments that build up a life: the awkward family meals, the day your spouse suddenly seems like a stranger, trying to make sense of how you have become the adult you are today, the conflicted gestures we make at trying to be good. \u201cTime passing is a plot. You can\u2019t not have something happen if the years go by,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5b84ebed63786a57def3726937a1794c436444fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b84ebed63786a57def3726937a1794c436444fd/0_0_320_499/320.jpg\" alt=\"Anne Tyler Redhead by the Side of the Road\" width=\"320\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As a child, Tyler\u2019s favourite book was the American classic <em>The Little House</em> by Virginia Lee Burton, about a house watching a city sprout up around it. Her fans \u2013 who have ranged from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/johnupdike\">John Updike</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jacquelinewilson\">Jacqueline Wilson</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/nickhornby\">Nick Hornby</a> \u2013 will recognise her memory of hoping the school would burn down as classic Tyler: her novels are studded with adult characters evoking childhood sensations, pleating time, revealing the truth of the adult through the child they were. In 2018\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/24/clock-dance-anne-tyler-review\">Clock Dance</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/24/clock-dance-anne-tyler-review\">,</a> a widow compares recovering from grief to \u201crainy days in her childhood when she would resign herself to staying in, reading or watching daytime TV, and then in the afternoon the sun would break through unexpectedly and she would think, Oh. I guess I can go outside now. Isn\u2019t that \u2026 a good thing, I guess.\u201d In <em>The Accidental Tourist</em>, Macon Leary empathetically imagines his young son Ethan\u2019s last moments before he was killed in a violent crime: \u201cmeekly moving to the kitchen with the others, placing his hands flat against the wall as he was ordered and no doubt bouncing slightly on the balls of his feet\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m more in touch with my emotions and the visceral sensory from childhood than any other part of life. I don\u2019t know if it helps with creativity, but I do know that when I talk to other writers they talk about their childhood in great detail,\u201d Tyler says. (She also still has residues of that childlike belief that one can make something happen by thinking about it. Just as she used to worry she would cause the school to burn down through wishing it, when I ask how she could bear to write the scene of Ethan\u2019s murder in <em>The Accidental Tourist</em>, she says she deliberately made him younger than her two daughters were then, \u201cso I wouldn\u2019t think as they came up to that age, \u2018Oh no, what have I set in motion?\u2019\u201d)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I am very comfortable writing as a man, and I think that\u2019s because I had really good men in my life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her new novel, <em>Redhead by the Side of the Road</em>, her 23rd, features many of the usual Tyler tropes. Its protagonist, Micah, is a man, as so many of Tyler\u2019s greatest characters are, which is partly why she has so many male fans. Writing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/13/why-men-love-anne-tyler-novels\">in this paper</a> in 2012, Mark Lawson put her cross-gender appeal down to the way \u201cshe deals sympathetically and redemptively with male fecklessness and helplessness\u201d. Tyler grew up with three brothers and was happily married for 34 years to Taghi Mohammad Modarressi, an Iranian psychiatrist, until his death in 1997. \u201cI am very comfortable writing as a man, and I think that\u2019s because I had really good men in my life. They made me feel comfortable and I thought, \u2018OK, they\u2019re not so different from me,\u2019\u201d she says.</p> <p>Like many of Tyler\u2019s male characters \u2013 Ian in <em>Saint Maybe</em>, Barnaby in <em>A Patchwork Planet</em>, Jesse in <em>Breathing Lessons</em>, Ezra in <em>Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant</em> \u2013 Micah has let his life drift past him after a youthful regret. Like Macon in <em>The Accidental Tourist</em>, he tries to counter the loss of control over his life by adhering to self-coined rules about when he cleans the kitchen, how he makes the bed, how he drives. \u201cMicah\u201d even sounds like \u201cMacon\u201d, but when I ask Tyler if the echo was deliberate she says no. \u201cBut I do often have fantasies about my characters ending up in the same little part of town and running into one another, so I can picture Micah and Macon doing that.\u201d</p> <p>Like all of Tyler\u2019s characters, Micah lives in Baltimore, as Tyler herself has done for more than 50 years. She has said that she\u2019s a writer so she can live out different lives, but it seems that whatever life she imagines, she always wants to live in Baltimore. \u201cYes, that\u2019s probably true. It\u2019s a city with character, but it is also laziness on my part \u2013 by setting the book here I don\u2019t have to do much research,\u201d she says with easy self-deprecation. I cannot let that pass: her books are full of meticulous research, such as the accurate period details in her decades-spanning family sagas, <em>The Amateur Marriage</em> and <em>A Spool of Blue Thread</em>. She meticulously writes her books out in longhand multiple times, and then reads them into a recorder and listens back to make sure the dialogue suits each character and there are no clangers. The idea that Tyler defaults to anything in her books out of laziness is nonsense \u2013 she just loves her city.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, I do love it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, it was a total accident that I came to the city, it was just for my husband\u2019s job. For the first two years we were saying, \u2018We made a mistake, let\u2019s go back.\u2019 But then you sink in, little by little.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike her other novels, <em>Redhead </em><em>by the Side of the Road</em> features multiple references to current events. Micah avoids watching the news because it\u2019s too \u201cdepressing\u201d, but he can\u2019t block out the \u201cunspeakably sad\u201d bulletins from his clock radio: \u201ca mass shooting in a synagogue; whole families are dying in Yemen; immigrant children torn from their parents will never, ever be the same, even if by some unlikely chance they are reunited tomorrow.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/02/redhead-by-the-side-of-the-road-by-anne-tyler-review-quietly-profound\">Redhead by the Side of the Road by Anne Tyler review \u2013 quietly profound</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI was writing the book already by the time Trump was in office and all that was going on. So I consciously felt it would be immoral to pretend life was just la la la. I don\u2019t want to be one of those people who ties their novel to current events so it\u2019s practically out of a newspaper, but at the same time I felt I should mention that it is an unhappy time,\u201d she says. Her books often end optimistically, showing human kindness. But is she having trouble maintaining that optimism about humanity in the current political climate? She hesitates for a second. \u201cNot up close, if you know what I mean. Up close you\u2019ll always see things to be optimistic about.\u201d</p> <p>Tyler grew up in Quaker communities around the south and midwest, the eldest of four children. She did not attend mainstream school until she was 11, and a common theme in her books is a character looking at the \u201cnormal\u201d world and trying to understand how it works, such as Micah feeling bewildered by the happy couples he sees on his morning jogs, or Aaron flummoxed by marriage in <em>The Beginner\u2019s Goodbye</em>: \u201cIt seemed we just never quite got the hang of being a couple the way other people did. We should have taken lessons or something; that\u2019s what I tell myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne of the first things that happened when I joined the school was I was surrounded by these girls and they were asking me all these questions. One said, \u2018Do you have a boyfriend?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m only 11.\u2019 And she said, \u2018I know, do you have a boyfriend?\u2019 And I thought, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m in another world here.\u2019 It was very tough to figure out, and I remember it very clearly,\u201d Tyler says. While at university, she started to write short stories, and then published her first novel, <em>The Tin Can Tree,</em> when she was 23. Aside from a five-year break to raise her daughters, she has written steadily ever since.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was a better writer when I was younger. I took more time. It\u2019s not as if I\u2019m in a rush now, but I trust the reader more</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI know the world does not need another book from me, but I have nothing else to do with myself. I have no hobbies. So then I feel guilty when I say to my agent, \u2018I seem to have another book ready if you want to take a look at it \u2026\u2019\u201d she says. Her ideal day would involve several hours of \u201cgood involved writing, the kind when you suddenly look up and three hours have gone by\u201d.</p> <p>While liking Tyler\u2019s books is as uncontroversial as liking chocolate, there have been some criticisms over the years, some more fair than others. Those who dismiss her as sentimental (\u201cour foremost NutraSweet novelist\u201d, one American critic wrote) overlook the biting humour in her work. \u201cRepetitive\u201d is more merited, although the familiar plots are shells for her elegant writing and characterisation, which are never boring. Yet I\u2019ve found some of her more recent novels less satisfying than her mid-career peak of <em>Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant</em>, <em>The Accidental Tourist</em> and <em>Breathing Lessons</em>. The New York Times\u2019 former book critic Michiko Kakutani <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/06/books/the-beginners-goodbye-by-anne-tyler.html\">put it more strongly</a> in 2012 when she complained that instead of the \u201cintimate knowledge of her characters\u2019 inner lives\u201d we get in Tyler\u2019s earlier books, the characters in <em>The Beginner\u2019s Goodbye</em> are \u201cirritating stick figures\u201d.</p> <p>But Tyler is her own best critic. She recently reread <em>The Accidental Tourist</em> for the first time in many years. \u201cAnd one of the things I thought was, \u2018I think I was a better writer when I was younger.\u2019\u201d What made her think that? \u201cI was more detailed, I took more time. It\u2019s not as if I\u2019m in a rush now, but I trust the reader more. I don\u2019t feel like I have to say that much about the character\u2019s inner feelings. But then as I read <em>The Accidental Tourist</em> I thought, \u2018Well, it\u2019s kind of nice to see all of Macon\u2019s inner feelings there.\u2019\u201d Aptly for a writer who always sees the best in her characters, Tyler\u2019s mistake was perhaps trusting some of her readers too much.</p> <p>Her daughters live in Philadelphia and San Francisco, and Tyler knows she has a tendency towards self-isolation, whether there\u2019s a global pandemic or not, \u201cand I don\u2019t think that\u2019s always healthy\u201d. So \u201cto bring the world into me\u201d, she has \u2013 when life is normal \u2013 regular nights at her home with friends, including a weekly friendship group she calls \u201cWine Therapy\u201d. She is already working on her next book, \u201cand once again, it\u2019s about a family and set in Baltimore\u201d, she says in a tone of pure self-mockery. Then with the grace that comes from a lifetime of self-knowledge, sinking in little by little, she adds, \u201cAnd I love all that.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Redhead by the Side of the Road</em> is published by Chatto.</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>At a time when we\u2019re mostly cooped up inside, looking longingly out of the window at the first blush of spring, it\u2019s fair to say a streaming service called Tropical on Demand pretty much has us at hello. Before you settle in for a marathon of beachy, pina colada-infused escapism, however, readjust your expectations a little. A small but enticing new service, Tropical on Demand is the VOD offshoot of Cinema Tropical, a leading distributor of independent Latin American cinema in the US \u2013 happily made accessible to an international online audience.</p> <p>Launched at the end of March, it\u2019s one of a surfeit of enterprising \u201cvirtual cinemas\u201d set up by arthouse distributors in response to the coronavirus shutdown: while many bigger films have opted to delay until cinemas reopen, others see the advantage of a captive at-home audience rapidly cycling through their viewing options and open to adventurous alternatives. At the glossy end of this market, you have something like <a href=\"https://www.curzonhomecinema.com/\">Curzon Home Cinema</a>: long prepared for such a crisis, even if they could never have known what that crisis would be, now serving its cinema-starved users with A-list new art films until relative normality resumes.</p> <p>But at the maverick end, Tropical on Demand offers a <a href=\"https://www.cinematropical.com/the-cinema-tropical-collection\">devoted online platform</a> \u2013 working via the Vimeo site \u2013 to films that would still be fighting for visibility in the very best of circumstances: it seems unlikely that many of the films in their curated collection would ever reach British cinemas. New and original Latin American directorial voices are given priority here, plucked from the less spotlight reaches of recent festival programmes. Their first five selections span Mexico, Bolivia, Argentina and the Dominican Republic, flipping between fiction and documentary. Some are more easily approachable than others; all are exciting, illuminating visions.</p> <p>The programme launched a fortnight ago with <strong><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/ondemand/awayfrommeaning/402529167\">Away from Meaning</a></strong>, an achingly intimate personal portrait by Mexican documentary-maker Olivia Luengas, centred on her sister Liliana\u2019s struggle with borderline personality disorder. Luengas explores a lifetime of mistreatment and misdiagnosis by medical authorities, and her family\u2019s own difficulties in supporting and understanding Liliana\u2019s mental health. There\u2019s no way to make this easy viewing, but the acute tenderness of its perspective gives it light and depth. Following its free 24-hour streaming premiere on the Cinema Tropical website, it\u2019s now available to watch for a modest \u00a33.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtZMJh26DUE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XtZMJh26DUE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtZMJh26DUE\">Watch a trailer for Everything Else</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>A second documentary, <strong><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/ondemand/stillburn/402607913\">Still Burn</a></strong>, covers further complicated family matters: director <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/maocine\">Mauricio Alfredo Ovando</a> is the grandson of the former Bolivian dictator Alfredo Ovando Cand\u00eda, and his film engages thoughtfully with that thorny legacy.

Awash in sleekly haunting imagery and very loosely inspired by Bart\u00f3k\u2019s opera <em>Bluebeard\u2019s Castle</em>, it\u2019s a study of adolescent women in emotional limbo that has the eerie, cryptic energy of a genuine daydream.</p> <p>Natalia Almada\u2019s gradually transfixing <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtZMJh26DUE\">Everything Else</a></strong>, meanwhile, is unexpectedly a film for the era of self-isolation. A character study of a sixtysomething government bureaucrat \u2013 beautifully played by Adriana Barraza, an Oscar nominee 14 years ago for <em>Babel</em> and showcased all too rarely since \u2013 attempting to extricate herself from the solitary invisibility of her own life, it\u2019s a piercing reminder that social distancing isn\u2019t a new concept to all. It dovetails thematically with <strong><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/400317321\">T\u00fa Y Yo</a></strong>, Natalia Cabral and Oriol Estrada\u2019s perceptive documentary about the temperamental relationship between an elderly widow and her younger, long-suffering domestic servant: an essay on human connection that bristles with unresolved class politics.</p> <p>It\u2019s a promising, provocative first batch of picks from a streaming initiative that will hopefully last longer than the pandemic that initially necessitated it. The site is further rounded out with a section of <a href=\"https://www.cinematropical.com/daily-recommendations\">daily viewing recommendations</a> from the diverse Latin American pool, including a beguiling Lucrecia Martel short and a past pick from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/15/guy-lodge-dvds-childs-pose\">this very column</a>: the smart, eco-minded school bus documentary<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5knpkw_94rA\"> </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5knpkw_94rA\">La Camioneta</a></strong>.

  "<p>\u201cI\u2019d always wanted a brother,\u201d says Declan Aumpu, the first time we meet. It\u2019s April 2017, and I am 23 years old. Dec, 26, has arrived in the back of a friend\u2019s van after a big night out. He is clearly nervous and has hardly slept. I\u2019m anxious, too.</p> <p>It\u2019s strange that we have never met, especially since so many people know we are half-brothers, and I gulp back feelings of regret and shame. We don\u2019t look much alike, beside our smiles, which curl up on the left-hand side of our mouths, but there is an instant connection; an immediate ease in each other\u2019s company. As we embrace outside the Merlin\u2019s Cave pub in Chalfont St Giles, south Buckinghamshire, it\u2019s like being reunited with an old friend.</p> <p>Later, in the pub, Dec tells me he was \u201cforever envious of the bond that brothers seemed to share\u201d, a feeling that only grew when, around the age of eight, he found out about me. He also explains that this is not our first meeting: more than two decades ago, we spontaneously played together with a boules set in a pub garden in nearby Chalfont St Peter, where our parents had grown up. Dec\u2019s mum, Tracey, beckoned him away as soon she realised who I was. I had no idea of the identity of my fleeting playmate. </p> <p>Dec drinks Stella; mine is a Guinness. The barman asks who I am, since Dec is a regular here, and Dec proudly says that I\u2019m his brother. Noticing the height difference between us (I\u2019m 6ft 4in and Dec is 5ft 8in), the barman raises an eyebrow and makes a joke about me being put into a grow bag at an early age.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The onus is on the siblings who have grown up with both their parents to reach out to their half-siblings</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I only learned of Dec\u2019s existence relatively recently. When my parents first got together in 1991, my dad, Nick, then 27, told my mother, Mandy, 26, about a rumour going around that he had recently fathered a child; he said it wasn\u2019t true, and my mum believed him. Soon afterwards, they moved from Chalfont St Peter to the more affordable town of Fenny Stratford, near Milton Keynes, where they had me and my younger brother, Rory. My mum heard nothing more about this rumour until many years later, when my uncle Andy referred to my dad\u2019s \u201cother son\u201d during a conversation with my aunt Judy; she later told my mother.</p> <p>Not wanting to disrupt Rory\u2019s GCSEs, Mum spent the next six months silently seething, before confronting Dad. Clearly regretful and contrite, he eventually told us about our half-brother as we slowly chewed paneer at an Indian buffet in July 2016. He claimed he had been warned to stay away from his baby son after his friendship with Tracey broke down, and that he had duly done so. Tracey has since said she had wanted him to be either a constant presence in Dec\u2019s life, or not present at all, and he had conceded that he was not ready to be a father. I was, and still am, bewildered: the dad I knew had never shied away from truth and responsibility.</p> <p>Once the news had sunk in, I got in touch with Dec, a landscape gardener and builder, on Facebook, and we arranged to meet. We settled on the Merlin\u2019s Cave, where he and my dad had met a handful of times since 2010, after my parents separated and my dad sent Tracey a Facebook friend request. Dec is keen to build a relationship with Dad, but neither of them are very good at texting each other back, never mind socialising or making time for enriching activities. Nor am I.</p> <p>Dec tells me that, growing up in Chalfont St Peter, most people viewed his connection to the Busbys as a matter not to be spoken about. Tracey struggled for money, and they spent time in a homeless hostel before moving to the next village. \u201cI still get called \u2018the bastard Busby\u2019 down the pub,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd at school, there were these girls who would viciously bully me for not having a dad.\u201d This prompted Tracey to tell him that his dad had another family. Then, at the age of eight, Dec was diagnosed with diabetes, and took part in a genetic study; through this, he discovered our father\u2019s name, and those of his half-siblings.</p> <p>Dec and I both spent large parts of our childhoods alone; he is an only child, while Rory is six years younger than me, and we didn\u2019t really connect until later in life. \u201cIf we\u2019d been introduced when we were younger, it would have been a different experience,\u201d Dec says now, three years after that first meeting. \u201cBut now you\u2019re my little brother.\u201d We may not see each other regularly, but we find comfort in keeping in touch to discuss our partners, work, family and the coronavirus. Just like brothers would.</p> <p>How does it feel for other siblings united in later life? Almost one in five British families have been <a href=\"https://www.standalone.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/StandAlonePrevalenceRESEARCH3.pdf\" title=\"\">touched by estrangement</a>, according to research by the charity Stand Alone, and a million children across the UK have <a href=\"https://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/core/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/CSJ-Press-Release-Lone-Parents.pdf\" title=\"\">no significant contact with their father</a>. Reenee Singh, a psychotherapist and CEO of the Association of Family Therapy, is clear about the emotional burden associated with this: \u201cIt can be very difficult for half-siblings to grow up knowing they have a family somewhere they\u2019re not in contact with,\u201d she says. \u201cIf their existence was a secret, it can leave them feeling confused, vulnerable, unprotected and insecure.\u201d</p> <p>However, she warns against rushing into a meeting with an estranged sibling, pointing out that it is better to exchange photos, letters or messages on social media first. In my own case, she says: \u201cYou\u2019re old enough to forge your own adult relationship and to bridge the gap between him and your father. The onus is on the siblings who have grown up with both their parents to reach out to their half-siblings.\u201d</p> <p>Reunions aren\u2019t always straightforward, as the 2018 documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/28/three-identical-strangers-the-bizarre-tale-of-triplets-separated-at-birth\" title=\"\">Three Identical Strangers</a>, about triplets separated at birth, tragically showed. Although the three brothers experienced a joyful reunion, followed by fame and success, they all struggled with mental health issues. One of the siblings, Eddy, took his own life in 1995. Meanwhile, plenty of people live their lives never knowing the whole story about their families or how many siblings they have.</p> <p>My meeting with Dec had raised questions for us both, and made me want to speak to other people who had experienced something similar. How had they found their long-lost siblings? Had they been able to reconcile their different upbringings and move beyond pondering what might have been?</p> <h2>\u2018You don\u2019t realise you\u2019ve got space for another sibling.

His father, Jan, disappeared shortly after he was born, and remarried twice, fathering a number of other children, including Paul. \u201cI wasn\u2019t close with my mum,\u201d Sandy says. \u201cShe was more like an aunt to me. As a kid, you feel a sense of abandonment. For about two and a half years from the age of 12, I was a carer for my grandmother when my grandfather was at work.\u201d</p> <p>When he was 18, Sandy visited Jan and his family in south Wales, to work out whether he should invite him to his wedding. It was during this visit that he discovered he had two younger siblings, Paul and Chantelle. But according to Paul, his parents told him that Sandy\u2019s visit \u2013 during which he was told to stay upstairs \u2013 had been to ask for money. Further attempts to talk to his parents about his half-brother were quickly shut down. This may explain why, when Sandy tried to make contact with Paul 15 years ago, his friend request on Facebook was rejected. Paul says he simply wasn\u2019t ready for another sibling, to share his father, or to grapple with his family\u2019s past.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wouldn\u2019t say we look like twins, but we are very similar. I felt driven to meet him because we clearly shared DNA</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Two years later, when Sandy was 40, and he and his wife were expecting their first child, he made a fresh attempt to get to know his half-siblings, first making contact with Chantelle. \u201cWe met up in Ireland and got on well,\u201d Sandy says. Then, in 2018, when looking for other Buseks online, he happened to send a friend request to Lucy, Paul\u2019s daughter, not realising she was his niece. \u201cShe printed a photo of me from Facebook and shoved it under his nose,\u201d Sandy says.</p> <p>\u201cMy wife was gobsmacked,\u201d Paul recalls. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we look like twins, but we are very similar. I felt driven to meet him because we clearly shared DNA.\u201d In September 2018, Paul contacted Sandy on LinkedIn. They didn\u2019t waste any time: three weeks later, Sandy flew to Bahrain to meet Paul, who works for a defence company in Saudi Arabia. According to Paul, the half-brothers got along \u201clike a house on fire\u201d, and later he and his family visited Sandy in the UK. \u201cYou don\u2019t realise you\u2019ve got space for another sibling, but when one turns up it\u2019s like, \u2018OK, yeah, this is great\u2019,\u201d Paul says.</p> <p>They noticed a number of coincidences. Sandy is teetotal, and Paul rarely drinks. They both enjoy luxury cars and clay pigeon shooting. Both brothers are 6ft 1in, weigh 105kg, and wear near-identical spectacles. They also have a similar fashion sense; on the day they met for the first time, both were dressed in blue-and-white striped polo shirts. \u201cWe look so similar,\u201d Paul says. \u201cIncredibly similar bad taste, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s spooky how many similarities there are,\u201d Sandy agrees. \u201cBut there are differences, too: I was wrapped up in cotton wool by my grandparents, while he\u2019s more of an alpha male after 26 years in the military.\u201d</p> <p>Paul says: \u201cI think he\u2019s probably a nicer guy than me. He\u2019s a bit more placid, more level-headed, but that might be the different nurturing he had from his side: I lived with our old man, he didn\u2019t.

He remembers his stepfather, who had his own children, being unkind to him and his sister, not allowing them to celebrate their birthdays. When Dougie discovered his real surname at the age of 11, after it was read out from his birth certificate during his communion, he began asking questions. \u201cBut I was always told to shut up.\u201d</p> <p>Then, one night, an aunt \u201cspilled the beans\u201d. He remembers learning that his mother had left his Irish father, Hugh, without explanation, in the early stages of her pregnancy with Dougie, not telling him she was bearing a child. \u201cAfter that, it was always on my mind,\u201d he says. \u201cI had known from a young age there was something different about me, but if I asked it was, \u2018lift the carpet, sweep it under\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Dougie left home at 15 and moved to Ireland to work in construction in 1972. He didn\u2019t start looking for his family in earnest until 2009, when he was made redundant. With his daughter, Katrina, Dougie began to do his research. They learned that, after the war, Hugh had worked in coal mines in Derbyshire; Katrina tracked down his details from a list of workers from the period. \u201cI was rattling, shaking, thinking, \u2018What am I going to do now?\u2019\u201d Dougie says. By then, Hugh was seriously ill: he ignored their letters and denied the connection over the phone. Eventually he relented, asking if Katrina could send some pictures.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re brothers and sisters. It feels like we\u2019ve known each other since birth. I couldn\u2019t ask for anything better</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Three months later, Hugh invited Dougie and his wife, Sally, to visit him in Derbyshire. Jo, Dougie\u2019s half-sister, remembers opening the door to them in September 2012: \u201cI looked at this poor, very nervous man who looked like he could have been my dad\u2019s brother and said: \u2018We couldn\u2019t disown you,\u2019\u201d she says now. \u201cHe was one of us, for sure.\u201d</p> <p>Dougie, who now lives in Kildare, south-west of Dublin, says he felt intense relief. \u201cI went, \u2018That\u2019s it: mission accomplished.\u2019 The first thing Jo told me was: \u2018The apple hasn\u2019t fallen far from the tree.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Jo, who also lives in Ireland, had only found out about Dougie an hour before meeting him. \u201cI was in England on work business and went to visit my dad,\u201d she recalls. \u201cHe kept saying things like, \u2018Ach, some fella from Scotland wants to come and see me.\u2019 But just before he arrived, he said: \u2018He says I could be his father.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Dougie never found out what sparked his mother\u2019s sudden flight. \u201cI never asked any awkward questions,\u201d he says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to go in bull-headedly. I set out to find him, and when I did, there was an ease there. There was no resentment.\u201d Dougie continued to speak to his father regularly on the phone and, after he died in November 2017, kept in contact with Jo, who lives three hours north of him in Donegal. Now their families spend holidays together. \u201cWe\u2019re brothers and sisters,\u201d he says. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019ve known each other for years, since birth. I couldn\u2019t ask for anything better.\u201d At family events, Dougie is often confused with his father. Five years ago, at a funeral, a cousin gasped in horror, thinking she had seen a ghost. </p> <p>Last summer, Jo arranged for Dougie and Sally to join her on a trip in their father\u2019s home county of Donegal, to scatter Hugh\u2019s ashes. Dougie did the honours: \u201cI broke down,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought I would never get to that stage. The whole trip brought me closer to my roots.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re really close now,\u201d Jo says. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely part of the family.\u201d The spare room is now known as Dougie and Sally\u2019s room, and they bought each other almost identical gifts for Christmas \u2013 shortbread biscuits in packaging featuring Highland terriers. \u201cIt\u2019s really bizarre, the connection we have.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018As an orphan, you fantasise about being in a family.

Peggy is mixed race, but her mother and the man who thought he had fathered her were white. Her birth caused shockwaves, and her mother suddenly disappeared from her life when she was two weeks old. She also left behind Peggy\u2019s half-sister, Linda, with whom she shared a cot.</p> <p>Peggy was put into an orphanage, and moved around the UK by the authorities, eventually ending up in a foster home at the age of 13. \u201cGrowing up, I was always told I was Jamaican,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it was being an orphan that defined me. People would tell me I didn\u2019t have the nose to be African-Caribbean. I felt my whole life that I didn\u2019t belong. People had minimal expectations of me, and called me \u2018half-caste\u2019.\u201d She went on to suffer from dissociative disorders, and struggled with drug misuse, self-harm and bulimia.</p> <p>She met her husband, and had two daughters with him, but Peggy says he was abusive and she continued to struggle. \u201cEvery time something happened to my daughter, if she fell down or hurt herself, my subconscious returned to how I was never cuddled when I was younger.\u201d</p> <p>She remembers being in her early 30s and hearing a radio interview with John Cleese about <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/families-and-how-to-survive-them-9780749314101.html\" title=\"\">Families</a> <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/families-and-how-to-survive-them-9780749314101.html\" title=\"\">And How</a> <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/families-and-how-to-survive-them-9780749314101.html\" title=\"\">To Survive Them</a>, the bestselling self-help book he co-authored with therapist Robin Skynner in 1983. The interview referenced an experiment in which people who know nothing about each other have to decide who to pair up with for an activity. \u201cThe two people who have not grown up with their family always go together,\u201d Peggy says. \u201cI recognised myself in this: I have lots of friends, but I still keep myself slightly separated. I just started crying.\u201d</p> <p>Peggy decided she needed to track down her family. Years before, on her 18th birthday, the Church of England had given her a piece of paper with her parents\u2019 and siblings\u2019 names on. In 1998, with the help of the Salvation Army, she found her elder half-brother Jack, who had grown up with his father, and away from their shared mother. But she could not find Linda, nor her eldest half-sister, Angela, who had been adopted. After her marriage unravelled, Peggy moved with her girls to the US in 2002, where she felt more at home. In 2009, she received a message on the family history site Ancestry from Mark, the husband of a 51-year-old Linda Sturman, asking her to confirm her name and date of birth. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m Mark, and I think I\u2019m married to your sister.\u2019 I cried all weekend.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019d always thought I could be walking down the street past my sister or my brother. But this was for real and we fitted</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The contact came after Linda\u2019s father had unexpectedly told his family about Peggy and Angela, over Sunday lunch, before his death. \u201cIt was a shock,\u201d Linda says. \u201cI said I needed to go home and process everything, and then I tried to find my sisters. I looked at the birth registrations in Brixton, and found them.\u201d Peggy describes their first meeting, over a meal in Twickenham, south-west London, as being \u201clike two pieces of a jigsaw coming together\u201d.</p> <p>Angela, now 63, and the eldest of the three sisters, was also there, thanks to Mark\u2019s detective work. She had been adopted as a child due to her parents\u2019 chaotic lives, and given another surname. She was living in Hastings, unaware that her family were looking for her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d always thought I could be walking down the streets past my sister or my brother,\u201d Peggy says. \u201cBut this was for real, and we just fitted. There was none of the baggage other people have \u2013 no, \u2018You did this to me when we were 12\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Peggy has stayed close to Linda. All four siblings meet up in Gorleston-on-Sea, where Linda lives, whenever Peggy is back in the UK. \u201cLinda and I both have mild depression,\u201d Peggy says. \u201cWe don\u2019t carry it around like a bad energy, but stuff happens that takes you back, and we\u2019ll give each other pep talks. We hold each other up.\u201d Linda also had a difficult upbringing: although she remained with her birth father, she never heard from her mother again. She says her father would often leave her in the care of friends while he was away working as a lorry driver. </p> <p>\u201cWe have a good bond,\u201d Linda says. \u201cI feel as if I\u2019ve known her for ever. We have different surnames, so it would have been impossible to find one another without modern technology.\u201d With the help of Mark, a keen amateur genealogist who trawled old newspapers and records to build a family tree, Peggy discovered that her father, Henwood Adrian, was actually from Guyana, and that she also has Congolese and Nigerian ancestry. \u201cIt has given me an identity and a sense of pride,\u201d Peggy says. \u201cBeing mixed race, people ask you: \u2018Where are you from?\u2019, \u2018What\u2019s your heritage?\u2019. It\u2019s nice not to have to lie or make something up.\u201d</p> <p>Peggy says it is only since meeting Linda, and the rest of her maternal family, that she has finally begun to overcome her pervading sense that she doesn\u2019t belong. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift that as an orphan you would fantasise about,\u201d Peggy says. \u201cYou dream about being in a family, as a unit. After I connected with them, it all clicked \u2013 I started to heal.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Is your home broadband groaning under the strain of everyone being stuck in the house and glued to their tablets, phones, laptops, smart TVs and so on?</p> <p>With more families using the same connection, and devices working flat out, many will be contending with a slow service, glitches and outages. But there are things you can do to relieve the pressure.</p> <p>First, ask your existing provider whether it can upgrade you to a faster fibre package without any loss of service, or the need for an engineer visit. This will largely depend on what\u2019s available in your area, but in many cases it should be possible.</p> <p>Then look at the small things that can make a difference. For example, did you know that a microwave oven can interfere with your wifi signal? It might sound like an urban myth, but Ofcom advises: \u201cDon\u2019t use the microwave when you\u2019re making video calls, watching HD videos or doing something important online.\u201d </p> <p>The UK\u2019s telecoms regulator told Guardian Money this advice specifically related to using a microwave, rather than its mere presence. However, some families have been going further and switching it off.</p> <p>Ofcom has launched Stay Connected, an information campaign to help consumers get the speeds and reception they need.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you can do, from simple tips to gadgets that can bolster your signal:</p> <p><strong>Run a quick speed test</strong></p> <p>Find out what speed you are actually getting. Ofcom\u2019s official <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-telecoms-and-internet/advice-for-consumers/advice/ofcom-checker\" title=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-telecoms-and-internet/advice-for-consumers/advice/ofcom-checker\">mobile and broadband checker</a>, is free. Popular alternatives include <a href=\"https://www.speedtest.net/\">Speedtest.net</a> and <a href=\"https://fast.com/en/gb/\">Netflix\u2019s Fast</a> speed checker, both for Android and iOS.</p> <p><strong>Reduce the pressure on your connection</strong></p> <p>One of the problems is that there will often be lots of devices attached to wifi at the same time. Tablets and smartphones often work in the background, so try switching off wifi reception when you are not using them. With a laptop, make sure as few applications as possible are connected to the internet, says Rory Stoves, at the comparison site Uswitch. And you might want to stagger when people are online.</p> <p><strong>Keep your router away from other devices</strong></p> <p>Cordless phones, baby monitors, halogen lamps, dimmer switches, stereos and computer speakers, TVs and monitors can all affect your wifi if they are too close to your router, says the regulator.</p> <p>Also, place your router on a table or shelf rather than on the floor \u2013 and reboot it if you haven\u2019t done so for a while. \u201cMake sure it is in a place where you\u2019re going to be accessing the internet most often,\u201d Stoves says.</p> <p><strong>Get a new router</strong></p> <p>If you have had your router for a few years, you might be able to get an updated one that has more powerful wifi. Check with your broadband provider but it may involve resigning a contract.</p> <p>If your provider can\u2019t help, consider replacing your router with a third-party one. Prices start at about \u00a370, rising to \u00a3150 for more powerful ones.</p> <p><strong>Wired rather than wireless</strong></p> <p>You could try using an ethernet cable to connect your computer directly to your router , which should give you a faster, more reliable connection, and can be picked up for as little as \u00a31.</p> <p>They have a \u201ccat\u201d number \u2013 the higher the number, the greater the maximum transmission speed and bandwidth. The latest high-spec ones are cat 8, though many people will not need one that fast. However, aim for at least cat 5.</p> <p>This is a complex and jargon-filled world. However, Guardian Money looked at ethernet cables in June 2019, and the websites Digital Trends and TheTechLounge have published March 2020 guides on the best available.</p> <p><strong>Make use of the free help offered by many broadband providers</strong></p> <p>Some companies offer tools that could make life easier. Virgin Media\u2019s Connect app lets customers check their wifi signal strength, pause wifi to certain devices and reboot their hub.</p> <p><strong>Gadgets and gizmos</strong></p> <p>There are lots of kit out there that can give your wifi a lift. Typically, a wifi booster (or wifi extender) \u2013 a smallish device you simply plug in \u2013 amplifies your signal. They are a good solution for bigger properties where you can plug them into the parts of the house that you struggle to get a decent signal, says Uswitch.</p> <p>If the Virgin Media Connect app finds any of these blackspots, it may try to sell you a booster for a typical extra \u00a33 a month. Be aware, however, you can get a decent one for about \u00a315.</p> <p>A pricier one that has been praised for its ease of use is the Netgear Nighthawk X4S tri-band wifi range extender. Unlike some, this keeps the same wifi name and password that you already have. But at \u00a3110-plus, it\u2019s not cheap.</p> <p><strong>Down your streaming</strong></p> <p>Turn off HD streaming if you are streaming a lot, says Stoves. With Netflix, for example, you can log in to its website, and under My Profile, select Playback Settings, and then change the data usage setting.</p> <h2><strong>What about switching provider?</strong></h2> <p>Many people in Britain are getting a poor service from their broadband provider and/or are overpaying. Under normal circumstances, many would be advised to consider switching, but the UK authorities are \u2013 understandably \u2013 not keen to encourage large numbers to switch right now because of the pressure on the networks and a wish to prioritise essential work, such as connecting up the new Nightingale coronavirus hospitals.</p> <p>The consumer group Which? was going to issue a press release in late March revealing the findings of its survey of internet service providers, but it has been delayed as it does not want to create a situation where lots of people are trying to switch because their provider has not scored particularly well.</p> <p>Ofcom says owing to these pressures, it may not be possible to switch at the moment. However, if you still want to, it is worth asking whether it is possible.</p> <p>Home visits by engineers have been halted temporarily, except for vulnerable customers, but if you have a superfast \u201cfibre to the cabinet\u201d connection, which millions do, then switching is electronic.</p> <p>Zen Internet says it came top of the latest Which? survey, with an 84% score, while the big four that dominate the market \u2013 BT, Sky, TalkTalk and Virgin Media \u2013 scored 50-60%.</p> <p>Richard Tang, Zen\u2019s founder and chairman, says switching takes 10 working days. It tends to happen overnight or very early in the morning, and typically people will not notice any impact, but there can be up to 30 minutes downtime.</p> <p>Tang says in recent weeks the company has had an increase in new customers, some of whom have been buying services for their elderly parents.</p>",
  "<p>There is now the terrible possibility that Britain may match or even overtake Italy and Spain as the country in Europe that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/uk-will-be-europes-worst-hit-by-coronavirus-study-predicts\">suffers most from the coronavirus pandemic</a>. This tragedy has a political, as well as a biological, epidemiology. Those seeking to trace its path may look back on a telling moment \u2013 paradoxically the one at which the government finally changed course and fell into line with most of the rest of Europe. On 20 March, Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/20/uk-coronavirus-live-confusion-over-key-workers-list-as-schools-close\">announced the closure</a> of pubs, clubs and restaurants. Even as he did so, however, he made it clear that this decision was an assault on the national character.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking away the ancient, inalienable right of free-born people of the United Kingdom to go the pub,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I can understand how people feel about that.\u201d Lest his anguish be in any doubt, he underscored the point: \u201cTo repeat, I know how difficult this is, how it seems to go against the freedom-loving instincts of the British people.\u201d The message was \u2013 what exactly? You must not go to the pub but your right to do so is \u201cinalienable\u201d (which is to say absolute and irrevocable). You must stay at home but, if you so do, you will be a disgrace to your freedom-loving ancestors.</p> \n<p>The Sun <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11242643/brits-beat-coronavirus-lockdown-diy-pubs/\">reported the prime minister\u2019s remarks</a> rather differently: \u201cMr Johnson said he realised it went against what he called \u2018the inalienable free-born right of people born in England to go to the pub\u2019.\u201d In this version, the freedom to go to the pub was conferred by genetics and history, not on the \u201cpeople of the United Kingdom\u201d or \u201cthe British people\u201d, but on \u201cpeople born in England\u201d. It does not apply to Scots, Welsh or Northern Irish people and certainly not to the 9.4 million people living in the UK who were born abroad. It is a particular Anglo-Saxon privilege.</p> \n<p>And since we are in the terrain of the ludicrous, the Sun\u2019s version actually made more sense. There is, of course, no ancient and absolute right to go to the pub \u2013 inns and public houses have been regulated in England at least since the 15th century. But what Johnson was really evoking was a very specific English sense of exceptionalism, a fantasy of personal freedom as a marker of ethnic and national identity.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a01c98ee-1da8-4dbb-b816-af3dabe22d9b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6j_jHXV8LMs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>That exceptionalism is not, alas, mere rhetorical self-indulgence. It helped to shape official policy towards the Covid-19 crisis. It lies behind both the idea that there should be a distinctive British response to this global challenge, and the assumption that there was something peculiarly unnatural in expecting Brits to obey drastic restrictions. Its legacy is the globally discredited policy of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/matt-hancock-government-policy-herd-immunity-community-surveillance-covid-19\">herd immunity</a>\u201d and the late introduction, squandering Britain\u2019s head start, of the lockdown.</p> \n<p>The prime minister himself has long cultivated the notion that he does not just espouse this freedom-loving exceptionalism \u2013 he embodies it. In the early stages of the crisis, Johnson\u2019s admirers could see it as his Finest Hour, the moment when his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/johnson-as-churchill-history-repeat-as-farce\">Churchillian posturing</a> would become real and he would save his country. When the prime minister was hospitalised, his overwrought friend and fan Toby Young confessed in the Spectator to \u201ca kind of mystical belief in Britain\u2019s greatness and her ability to occasionally bring forth remarkable individuals \u2026 who can serve her at critical junctures. I\u2019ve always thought of Boris as one of those people \u2013 not just suspected it, but known it in my bones.\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson\u2019s Churchill impersonation has always been a way of claiming that his own waywardness is not mere self-indulgence but the mark of a special (and idiosyncratically English) destiny. In his book, The Churchill Factor, he wrote of his idol: \u201cThere is a sense in which [Churchill\u2019s] eccentricity and humour helped to express what Britain was fighting for \u2013 what it was all about. With his ludicrous hats and rompers and cigars and excess alcohol, he contrived physically to represent the central idea of his own political philosophy: the inalienable right of British people to live their lives in freedom, to do their own thing.\u201d Guess who this was meant to bring to mind for contemporary readers?</p> \n<p>Being drunk on freedom is one way for the chosen people to \u201cdo their own thing\u201d. Adopting a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/confused-dangerous-flippant-worlds-media-pans-pms-handling-of-coronavirus-boris-johnson\">distinctive national approach</a> to a global pandemic is another. The myth of a unique and defining love of personal freedom as a badge of nationhood underpinned a profound reluctance to impose life-saving restrictions on movement and social gatherings. Other people might put up with that sort of thing, but not the English. On the altar of this exceptionalism, lives have been sacrificed.</p> \n<p>This innate, genetic resistance to conformity is a myth. This is obvious from the persistence of an equal and opposite cliche of Englishness: the queue. George Orwell could rhapsodise \u201cthe gentle-mannered, undemonstrative, law-abiding English\u201d and \u201cthe orderly behaviour of English crowds, the lack of pushing and quarrelling, the willingness to form queues\u201d. The anthropologist Kate Fox wrote: \u201cDuring the London riots in August 2011, I witnessed looters forming an orderly queue to squeeze, one at a time, through the smashed window of a shop they were looting.\u201d Orderliness is just as prominent as waywardness in the English self-image \u2013 which suggests that neither of these truisms is ancient, inalienable or worth a damn when you are making policy in a time of plague.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/10/1000-deaths-a-day-dominic-raab-nhs\">With 1,000 deaths a day, our leaders should be facing far tougher questions | Marina Hyde</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The exceptionalist \u201cfreedom-loving instinct\u201d has little to do with history and much more to do with current politics, specifically the politics of Brexit. Johnson described as \u201cmagnificent\u201d a 2014 book by the arch-Brexiter Daniel Hannan called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/06/daniel-hannan-linda-colley-europe\">How We Invented Freedom</a> \u2013 \u201cwe\u201d being the Anglo-Saxons. Hannan expressly reclaimed the idea of exceptionalism, the freedom-loving Anglo-Saxons being the exception especially to European slavishness. Brexit, as he argued, was one imperative of this dichotomy. Tragically, a notion that the UK could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/apr/10/world-health-organization-who-v-coronavirus-why-it-cant-handle-pandemic\">ignore the World Health Organi</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/apr/10/world-health-organization-who-v-coronavirus-why-it-cant-handle-pandemic\">zation</a> and<strong> </strong>do its own thing with the virus was another.</p> \n<p>Covid-19, as Johnson himself discovered in the most awful way, doesn\u2019t make exceptions. The threat is universal. And the shield against it \u2013 the NHS \u2013 is cosmopolitan and global. There are 200 different nationalities represented in its ranks by 150,000 doctors, nurses and ancillary staff. One consolation in this disaster is the realisation that Britain is exceptionally lucky to have them.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Fintan O\u2019Toole is a columnist with the Irish Times</p>",
  "<p>Many individuals and organisations have been offering their valuable time and resources to help the NHS and those worst affected by the coronavirus. This includes numerous chefs and restaurant staff who have been cooking, delivering food, raising money and offering help where they can.</p> <p>I am proud of nine chefs from the Ottolenghi restaurants who, next week, will be volunteering at Manorfield primary school in Tower Hamlets. There, they will be feeding the children of the local GP, a pharmacist, a nurse and other essential workers, as well as some of the most vulnerable children in the area. They will be relieving a <a href=\"https://www.tes.com/news/coronavirus-michelin-star-chefs-cook-free-school-meals\">team of chefs from the Dorchester Hotel</a> who have been cooking at the school for the past few weeks.</p> <p>Even in normal times, we mustn\u2019t forget, restaurants are vibrant community institutions. They are hubs of social interaction, they are centres of knowledge and creativity, they often lead the way in progressive and sustainable ways of cooking and serving food, and they pay wages to hundreds of thousands of people.</p> <p>Sadly, our beloved restaurant industry now has a very dark cloud hanging over it. All it has created is now threatened.</p> <p>In March, the government\u2019s emergency legislation in response to the Covid-19 pandemic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/london-pubs-cinemas-and-gyms-may-close-in-covid-19-clampdown\">ordered restaurants to close</a> with immediate effect. While these restrictions, which are undoubtedly necessary for safeguarding public and staff health, are to be reviewed every 28 days, we don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll be able to reopen. Nor do we know what restrictions are going to be imposed on trading hours, on density of diners, or any other limitations that we can\u2019t envisage at this point. It will probably take months before we become profitable again.</p> <p>Ours is a cash-based industry. It\u2019s not one of the most lucrative, but it is generally sound, because British restaurants, of which we can all be immensely proud, have come on in leaps and bounds in the past few decades. Fuelled by the limitless passion of kitchen and front-of-house staff, UK restaurants are innovative, forward-looking, offer value for money and draw in a vast number of local and international guests.</p> <p>Unfortunately, due to the effects of the coronavirus, we are now in an extremely perilous situation. With zero income and the future uncertain, we simply don\u2019t have any cash to spare. Thanks to the government-funded furlough scheme, we are fortunate enough to be able to pay our staff while they are at home.</p> <p>There are, however, other serious issues, the most burning of which is rent. Though some landlords have made private arrangements with tenants to forgo rent payments for a certain period, most are demanding their quarterly transfers. For businesses with zero income, this is a kiss of death. Accumulating debt now, when we are not operating, will severely hamper our ability to re-establish businesses that pay salaries, taxes, bills and rents. For many, it will simply mean that they cannot renew trading \u2013 this would be a devastating and totally unnecessary outcome. For the lucky ones, it will mean that they hang on by the skin of their teeth, but will not have enough capital to expand and create more jobs, which will be so sorely needed when this crisis is over.</p> <p>Though recent legislation stops landlords from physically evicting tenants who don\u2019t pay rent, they are still able to take legal action which puts a restaurant out of business: a winding-up petition can be imposed, freezing a company\u2019s bank accounts. Some landlords have already threatened to do this.</p> <p>In legal terms, our leases normally declare that we must operate restaurants on the sites we occupy. But we are now prohibited from doing so by the government. How can we be expected to pay rent as normal when the fundamentals of our leases with our landlords have been eradicated?</p> <p>I call on the government to step in once more and fix this anomaly. The wholesale collapse of a vibrant and sound sector, under a rent and debt squeeze, will benefit no one, landlords included.</p> <p>One option is for the government to bring in a total debt-enforcement moratorium for the next six months. This will allow restaurants to build up all their resources for the challenging times ahead. Landlords who rely on rents for repaying debts will also avoid finding themselves defaulting on their own obligations. Other alternatives have been suggested, all of which aim to allow restaurants to cease paying rent for a time, while supporting landlords through this loss in income.</p> <p>On Sunday night the Queen, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/queen-urges-britons-stay-strong-coronavirus-covid-lockdown\">speaking </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/queen-urges-britons-stay-strong-coronavirus-covid-lockdown\">to the nation</a> about our current crisis, said: \u201cIf we remain united and resolute, then we will overcome it.\u201d Landlords and tenants must stay united in partnership and, with the government\u2019s help, avoid the kind of short-sightedness that will ultimately bring everyone down.

  "<p>A hunger crisis is rapidly developing among British people in lockdown, as millions report having to go without meals, food charities and local government have warned.</p> <p>Just three weeks into the lockdown, the Food Foundation said that 1.5 million Britons reported not eating for a whole day because they had no money or access to food. Some 3 million people in total were in households where someone had been forced to skip some meals. More than 1 million people reported losing all their income because of the pandemic, with over a third of them believing they would not be entitled to any government help.</p> <p>The foundation\u2019s findings are based on a YouGov poll carried out across England, Scotland and Wales this week. Its director, Anna Taylor, said the crisis was too big to be left to food banks and local authorities without funding. \u201cThis needs urgent and substantial investment from central government which needs to put money directly into the pockets of families who can\u2019t afford food.\u201d</p> <p>Charities running food banks are also struggling to cope with a huge rise in people coming to them for emergency parcels. Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network, said she feared the government was being too slow to respond and the situation was \u201cspiralling out of control\u201d.

He speaks with evident delight of a common phenomenon: a fascination with Lincoln formed \u201cas a fourth-grade boy\u201d, on reading \u201ca picture biography\u201d and \u201cfeeling drawn even to his face\u201d.</p> <p>Lincoln is the president who really did come from nothing, who went to Washington from what was then the wild and unruly west, who spoke of government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/04/abraham-lincoln-president-gettysburg-address\">of the people, by the people, for the people</a>, who oversaw the preservation of the union and the end of slavery, and who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/from-the-archive-blog/2015/apr/14/president-lincoln-assassination-1865\">killed in cold blood on Good Friday 1865</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere is this feeling of sadness inside Lincoln that we don\u2019t get with most of our famous leaders,\u201d Widmer says. \u201cAnd this sadness shows a deeper capacity for reason and someone who\u2019s experienced a great deal in life, which was true.</p> <p>\u201cLater I graduated to reading his speeches and so many of them are beautifully written. I think we still consider him the most eloquent of our presidents.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence</p> <footer> <cite>Abraham Lincoln</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Widmer wrote speeches for Bill Clinton and advised Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state. He happily accounts himself a \u201cspeech nerd\u201d, so we happily discuss one of Lincoln\u2019s lesser-known addresses, which he gave <a href=\"http://hd.housedivided.dickinson.edu/node/25114\">at Independence Hall in Philadelphia</a> on 22 February 1861.</p> <p>But there\u2019s something to get out of the way. The place of Lincoln, and books about him, in a nation jaggedly divided again.</p> <p>Lincoln\u2019s life, Widmer says, \u201cis a story of incredible survival against adversity. And more than survival, really, sort of winning on every possible front. And whenever we fail again, which we do pretty routinely, I think he still speaks to us and helps us to be better than we might be otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>You may see where this is heading. Covid-19 is ravaging the land and to some Lincoln\u2019s successor in the White House, the 45th president, seems to be losing the fight.</p> <p>I ask the inevitable question, prompted by interviews with historians of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/08/sidney-blumenthal-lincoln-politics-trump-republicans\">Lincoln</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/28/david-blight-on-frederick-douglass-i-call-him-beautifully-human\">Frederick Douglass</a> but also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/20/where-memory-leads-saul-friedlander-holocaust-history-trump\">the Holocaust</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/09/sarah-bakewell-at-the-existentialist-cafe-book-interview\">Jean-Paul Sartre</a>. Does Widmer\u2019s book contain lessons for readers in America under Trump?</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d he says, picking his words with care, \u201cI hope it does. I think one of the reasons we read history is for insights into our present.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/28/david-blight-on-frederick-douglass-i-call-him-beautifully-human\">David Blight on Frederick Douglass: 'I call him beautifully human'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Maybe such caution is born of Widmer\u2019s Clintonian background \u2013 he\u2019s an alumnus of the same White House as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/08/sidney-blumenthal-lincoln-politics-trump-republicans\">Sidney Blumenthal</a>, now three volumes into a five-volume life of Lincoln but a bete noire for many Trump supporters. Maybe it isn\u2019t. Widmer continues.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be too nakedly political. I want to reach out to all Americans from all backgrounds, I really do. While writing this book I was conscious of how much I learned from my Republican grandmother.</p> <p>\u201cI think Lincoln\u2019s example shows how important it is to be an ethical person, which he was, very unusually for politicians in his own time as well as ours. He was uncomfortable talking about himself and he tried to give the credit to others.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He tried to say to Americans, 'It\u2019s really important to get democracy right'</p> <footer> <cite>Ted Widmer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cBut he also had a long view. He tried to say to Americans, \u2018It\u2019s really important to get democracy right, because so many other people are depending on us, not just people in this country, with and without political rights, but other countries who are trying to become more democratic.\u2019</p> <p>\u201c\u2026 And he was thinking a lot about the future too. He mentions the 20th century in a few speeches. And so I think he was trying to reach out to us. And I think we should not be ashamed about looking back to him.</p> <p>\u201cHow can we be the most ethical people? How can we choose the wisest leaders? How can we get back to factuality? There are facts that bolster Republican arguments and there are facts that bolster Democratic arguments. But to at least admit the facts will make us a better country.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018The most sublime statement\u2019</h2> <p>Back to Philadelphia.

He also sidesteps the constitution with all of its awkwardness on racial questions and slavery and he just goes right to the core of the national experiment, that we are trying to make democracy work for all people.

So I argue that he really had worked out something very important.\u201d</p> <p>Widmer started out aiming simply to portray \u201cLincoln moving in a fast-moving conveyance, a train, in a very dangerous situation\u201d. It \u201cfelt cinematic\u201d, he says, and indeed it does, as the places Lincoln saw \u2013 Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Baltimore and its nests of would-be assassins \u2013 slide past.</p> <p>But then he \u201crealised Lincoln was changing in important ways along the way and Philadelphia\u2019s the key to that. He\u2019s giving better and better speeches, though there were a couple clunkers, and I like that because it shows a human Lincoln.</p> <p>\u201cHe gave a very bad speech about the economy in Pittsburgh and he nearly lost his inaugural speech in Indianapolis. He had a lot of problems. But then he starts about what it means to be an American.\u201d</p> <p>Around Lincoln\u2019s odyssey, quoting Homer liberally, Widmer wraps a richly written account of the concurrent journey of the Confederate president, Jefferson Davis; diversions on train-travel in the 19th century (Widmer is a passionate defender of 21st-century Amtrak); and portrayals of those who Lincoln met, who recorded their thoughts in diaries, letters and long-lost local papers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When Americans are being whipsawed by the news \u2026 Lincoln gives an absolutely beautiful speech on Washington's birthday</p> <footer> <cite>Ted Widmer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is also \u201ca lot about the building, Independence Hall, and what a difficult history it had\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAt a time when Americans are being whipsawed by the news, Lincoln goes into the most sacred building of American political history, where the Declaration of Independence was written and signed, and he gives an absolutely beautiful speech on George Washington\u2019s birthday about how this is the document that has guided him throughout everything he\u2019s ever done in politics.</p> <p>\u201cBut in fact, [the hall] had been used as a holding pen for African Americans in the 1850s who were being recaptured. They would make it to Philadelphia and to freedom in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/09/the-underground-railroad-colson-whitehead-revie-luminous-furious-wildly-inventive\">the Underground Railroad</a>, and then they would be recaptured, often even if they were legitimately free, they would be incarcerated in a jail inside the Independence Hall, and sent back into the south.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2352c17631ff92020c9c3aa437795b98da1c6e95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2352c17631ff92020c9c3aa437795b98da1c6e95/0_111_5074_3043/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Independence Hall today.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Independence Hall today.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valery Sharifulin/TASS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSo that building had become tainted in the eyes of a lot of Americans.

its lockdown until May 3, two trade union sources told Reuters on Thursday after meeting ministers. </p> \n  <p>* British Prime Minister Boris Johnson left intensive care on Thursday evening as he

found its scientific advisers were too slow to communicate their growing concerns.</p> \n  <p>* Britain urged its citizens to stay at home over the coming Easter holidays, amid fears that the pull of wanting to see family and friends over the Christian festival could undermine efforts to stop the virus spread. </p> \n  <p>* Social distancing measures have helped Germany to slightly slow the spread of the coronavirus, Chancellor Angela Merkel said. </p> \n  <p>* The number of confirmed infections in Germany rose by 5,323 in the past 24 hours to 113,525 on Friday, climbing for a fourth straight day, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed. </p> \n  <p>* Russia reported a record one-day rise in cases, pushing its tally to more than 10,000.</p> \n  <p>* The Czech

Donald Trump has attempted to blame the WHO for the pandemic, pointing to a WHO tweet on 14 January saying \u201cthere was no human-to-human transmission\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>China reported

Daegu, which endured the first large coronavirus outbreak outside of China, on Friday reported zero new cases for the first time since late February, as new infections across the country dropped to record lows.</li> \n   <li><strong> </strong><strong>Boris Johnson was moved out of intensive care.</strong> A spokesperson said: \u201cThe prime minister has been moved this evening from intensive care back to the ward, where he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>16.8 million Americans lost their jobs in the last three weeks</strong> as the coronavirus pandemic brings the US economy to a standstill. 6.6 million of those jobs were lost in the last week alone.</li> \n   <li><strong>Pope Francis presided at a scaled-down Holy Thursday mass in an empty St Peter\u2019s Basilica. </strong>He spoke from a secondary altar behind the main one he normally uses and the occasion was attended by only two dozen people, including a few aides, nuns and a scaled-down choir.</li> \n   <li><strong>Bang</strong><strong>ladesh imposed a \u201ccomplete lockdown\u201d in its Cox\u2019s Bazaar district,</strong> which

  "<p>\u201cAre you a Catholic?\u201d</p> <p>The question eventually surfaces over dinner or drinks in so many conversations: about the child sex abuse royal commission, marriage equality, religious freedom, legalising abortion and euthanasia. About George Pell.</p> <p>Many of us baptised Catholic have drifted \u2013 through boredom, scepticism, disbelief or outright disgust with the Roman church \u2013 from Christmas Catholic to census Catholic to lapsed Catholic. Over the decades I\u2019ve been outside the church I\u2019ve also used ex-Catholic, non-practising Catholic and mis-Catholic.</p> <p>In his statement after<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/07/cardinal-george-pell-conviction-quashed-australia-high-court-freed-jail-appeal-upheld\"> being acquitted of child sexual abuse charges by the high court,</a> Pell said his trial was not a referendum on the church. But when you\u2019ve come to realise you\u2019re not identifiably any sort of Catholic and that the church running the show has made itself contemptible to you, how do you cast your vote? How do you become, formally, not-a-Catholic?</p> <p>The answer isn\u2019t in the help menu of the Vatican\u2019s website.</p> <p>In fact, the church has moved to close the few openings by which the disaffected could officially register having renounced the faith. In 2006 the Vatican established rules to accommodate the growing number of defectors \u2013 as they call them there. Oddly for such a slow-moving institution, the rules were aborted just three years later. Unlike a state with its citizens or a football club with its members, the Vatican would no longer facilitate the initiated leaving its ranks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/it-is-not-possible-to-divorce-george-pells-acquittal-from-the-catholic-churchs-history-of-child-abuse\">It is not possible to divorce George Pell's acquittal from the Catholic Church's history of child abuse | Francis Sullivan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For many parents, baptising a child is a bit of cheap soul insurance or done blithely for the benefit of devout grandparents. But for the Catholic church, it\u2019s the door to membership and salvation. A one-way door. Baptism \u201cimprints on the soul an indelible spiritual sign\u201d and creates an \u201contological and permanent bond\u201d with Jesus and the church. And this contract is recorded on a parish baptismal register, forever.</p> <p>Over time and with much tumult the church has been made to accept that a marriage might end in divorce. But not a baptism. There can be no divorcing the church. And it battles the modern world to maintain the purity of this doctrine.</p> <p>Yet people do want to leave. In droves. These days the church can\u2019t burn heretics or ignore the estranged who continue to write renouncing their Catholicism. Some of these ex-Catholics have shared their experiences online.</p> <p>It seems dioceses around the world have been responding \u2013 when they respond \u2013 in accordance with the abolished 2006 rules on \u201cdefection\u201d. On written advice of defection to your diocese of baptism, the local archbishop deliberates \u2013 apparently applying the church\u2019s criteria for the extreme measure of excommunication. If satisfied, he replies that it is sad to receive your request but a note of your desire to leave will be made on the baptismal register.</p> <p>The only barely acknowledged way out of this global institution \u2013 if that\u2019s how you can characterise such a note \u2013 is by an informal, decentralised, subterranean convention.</p> <p>I wrote to the Sydney archdiocese in the week a jury would convict Pell as a choirboy rapist<strong>.</strong> Over five carefully considered A4 pages I condemned the church as cruel on abortion, euthanasia and suicide; as malign on contraception; recalcitrant on women; degenerate and prurient on gays and sex; and as criminal on child sex abuse. I wasn\u2019t a Catholic and wanted any relevant records amended to protect me from the church, and to protect its members from ever mistaking me for a Catholic.</p> <p>And then \u2026 nothing. It took two more chase-up letters over three months to rouse any response. When it came I was presented \u2013 without consultation \u2013 with that familiar vague undertaking to formally note on the baptismal register my desire to leave.</p> <p>\u201cDesire to leave\u201d is a slippery formula \u2013 a small nod to an intention that preserves the church\u2019s position: yes, you\u2019d like to leave but actually \u2026 you can\u2019t. It sidesteps the facts: you have left and you are not Catholic.</p> <p>I wanted more than \u201cdesire to leave\u201d. I demanded my own form of words on the baptismal register.</p> <p>Demands on the Sydney archdiocese are best made with the backing of secular law. Under federal privacy law Australian privacy principle 13 requires entities like the Catholic church to correct personal information that is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading. An old baptismal entry ticks at least four of those five boxes.</p> <p>Faced with the threat of a civil complaint and being hauled before the office of the Australian information commissioner, the archdiocese suddenly \u2013 after 10 months and 10 letters \u2013 relented. A photocopy of my baptismal register entry arrived with a handwritten inscription of my own little prayer of disassociation: \u201cConsiders himself not a Catholic and wants not to be dealt with as one.\u201d</p> <p>Is it worth the effort to counter a symbol to which you ascribe no meaning? That\u2019s not the question, really. The questions are for the Catholic church.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/07/pope-francis-decries-unjust-sentences-after-cardinal-george-pell-acquitted\">Pope Francis decries 'unjust sentences' after cardinal George Pell acquitted</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Why does an archdiocese archive its sacraments and give up microfilm copies of its registers to posterity \u2013 in Sydney\u2019s case <a href=\"https://www.sydneycatholic.org/directory/listing/sydney-archdiocesan-archives\">its website says</a> to the National Library of Australia, State Library of NSW and the Society of Australian Genealogists? Why does it obscure, obstruct and resist proper correction of its records? Why doesn\u2019t it move to establish a simple, transparent process of correction? Why is it for non-believers to drift off silently? Why won\u2019t the church let go?</p> <p>The answer to each question is the same: power. The church\u2019s business model is sin and salvation. It says you\u2019re a sinner yet can be saved. But only if you\u2019re one of us; only if you do as we say.</p> <p>Renunciation forces the Catholic church to listen to what it refuses to hear: I reject your claim of authority over me. You cannot tell me what to do or think, how to live, whom I love or marry, what I do with my body. I am gone and you will do me this courtesy: stay the hell out of my life.</p> <p>To those who want to record their vote in a referendum on the Catholic church, here\u2019s my Easter advice. Write to the archbishop of the diocese of your baptism. Give your name, date of birth, parents\u2019 names, location of baptism and its estimated date \u2013 enough for the foundation document, your baptismal entry, to be identified.</p> <p>Reference Australian privacy principle 13 and demand the record be corrected. Specify the correction you want. My formulation sets a precedent for what the church will accept beyond<em> \u201c</em>desire to leave\u201d. Feel free to use it or try taking it further. Demand that evidence of the amendment be provided within 30 days. After then you might be in a position, if necessary, to <a href=\"https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-complaints/\">lodge a complaint</a> to the information commissioner.</p> <p>Still, the challenge remains for the Catholic church to do so much better. I call on the church to introduce an official mechanism to fully, formally record renunciations; a register of renunciation cross-referenced to baptismal records. The mechanism should be accessible through all archdiocesan websites.</p> <p>A Finnish <a href=\"https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fi&amp;u=https://eroakirkosta.fi/&amp;prev=search\">website</a> has automated more than 730,000 resignations from Finland\u2019s two state churches since new freedom of religion laws were introduced in 2003. The same can be done everywhere.</p> <p>Good luck to the many wonderful believing Catholics who insist it\u2019s their church, not the bishops\u2019, and continue to operate from within a toxic institution; fighting the good fight, doing their various good works. I love the sinner, hate the sin.</p> <p>But am I a Catholic?</p> <p>No.</p> <ul> <li><p>Sebastian Tesoriero was baptised in the Catholic church as an infant and has no religion</p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>",

It was signed by more than 30 entities.</p> \n  <p>Guidelines suggested include requiring domain name registrars to validate names and registration information, and to make that data accessible to federal agencies and law enforcement.</p> \n  <p>This could more easily prevent scams like <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-files-its-first-enforcement-action-against-covid-19-fraud\">one case</a> brought by the Department of Justice against <a href=\"http://coronavirusmedicalkit.com/\">coronavirusmedicalkit.com</a> last month.

From the letter:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>\u201cLaunch a nationwide public service campaign to educate consumers about common scams targeting the economically vulnerable. Over the next several weeks, most consumers will receive checks of $1,200 or more because of the recently enacted Cares Act. Scammers are already defrauding consumers by claiming they can expedite the receipt of these funds. The FTC and IRS should dramatically increase their efforts to educate consumers about these scams, and the Department of Justice should prioritize investigation and prosecution of the criminals behind them.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-10T20:45:33.561Z\">at 9.45pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e90d2758f081a236f1916c5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/mario-koran\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-10T20:09:50.220Z\">9.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>About 74 miles of city streets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/oakland-california-slow-streets-coronavirus-us\">will be blocked off</a> for joggers and bikers to enjoy for Easter weekend after Libby Schaaf, the mayor of Oakland, California, announced a \u201cslow streets initiative\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The move will give residents a way to get outdoors at a time when the record number of visitors who flocked to beaches and parks prompted officials to close popular recreational spots. </p> \n  <p>\u201cBecause of the reduction in car traffic, we will be closing off a number of streets so that bicyclists and pedestrians can spread out and take in fresh air safely on Oakland streets, free of cars,\u201d Schaaf said Thursday.

The Associated Press reports:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>President Donald Trump is warning without evidence that expanding mail-in voting will increase voter fraud. But several GOP state officials are forging ahead to do just that, undermining one of Trumps arguments about how elections should be conducted amid the coronavirus outbreak.</p> \n   <p>While Trump has complained that voting by mail was ripe for fraud,\u201d Republican state officials in Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia have all taken steps to ease access to mail-in ballots, following health officials warnings that voting in person can risk transmission of the deadly virus. The Republican governor of Nebraska urged voters to apply for absentee ballots. Florida\u2019s GOP chairman says the party will continue to run a robust vote-by-mail program.</p> \n   <p>The disconnect between Trump and Republican state officials illustrates the abrupt, hard turn the president and his national political allies have taken on the issue. Before the coronavirus hit, many in the GOP had warmed to mail-in voting, agreeing that it can be conducted without fraud and even used to their political advantage.</p> \n   <p>But Trump\u2019s hard line appears to be driven by his personal suspicions and concerns about his own reelection prospects.

The weekend long curfew, the first of its kind within the United States geographical borders, will be enforced by tribal police, who have been authorized to sanction violators with a fine of up to $1000 and/or 30 days in jail. Essential workers such as medical staff are exempt, but must carry a letter from their employer. </p> \n  <p>On Thursday, Navajo president <strong>Jonathan Nez</strong> and vice-president <strong>Myron Lizer</strong>, announced that they were going into self-quarantine after recently coming into contact with a first responder who later tested positive for the virus. \u201cThis is real and no-one is immune from contracting the virus. We will continue to fight for our people as we self-quarantine - this is a precautionary measure,\u201d said Nez during an online town hall meeting. </p> \n  <p>The Navajo government was quick to implement prevention and mitigation measures after reporting its first case on 17 March, in an effort to minimize spread through its vast territory which stretches over parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. This included issuing a stay at home order just two days after California, followed by an 8pm to 5am curfew. But, the virus is spreading rapidly with 558 confirmed cases including 20 deaths as of Thursday 9 April. </p> \n  <p>Last month, the US federal government approved $8bn for native communities and tribal services in its third coronavirus rescue package, but tribal leaders fear that they won\u2019t see the money until summer due to red tape and paperwork.
