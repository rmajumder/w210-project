  "<p>Law enforcement in San Francisco over the weekend shut down a nightclub that had been operating illegally amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>A public health order <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/california-governor-directs-all-bars-nightclubs-wineries-close-coronavirus\">issued on 16 March</a> and expanded on 31 March closed bars, nightclubs and other venues in California to slow the spread of the virus.</p> <p>But a time-lapse video created by investigators showed more than 150 people entering and leaving the club on the weekend of 4 April, with none adhering to guidance on physical distancing.</p> <p>The video also showed 20 to 30 cars parked or departing from the building, according to the city attorney\u2019s office. A witness told investigators that club-goers were especially raucous that weekend.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/07/california-covid-19-whats-next-outbreak-lockdown\">'A reality check on the math': What's ahead for California and Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe are going to use every tool at our disposal, including these types of warrants, to protect public health during this pandemic. Cramming dozens of people into an illegal club during this outbreak is like dropping a lit match in the woods during fire season. Who knows how far the damage will spread? It\u2019s the epitome of irresponsibility,\u201d Dennis Herrera, the city attorney, said <a href=\"https://www.sfcityattorney.org/2020/04/13/city-attorney-sfpd-shut-down-illegal-nightclub-operating-during-pandemic/\">in a statement</a>.</p> <p>Herrera on Friday obtained \u201ca civil inspection and abatement\u201d warrant, which allowed police to shut down the club and seize assets. It\u2019s the first such warrant to be used to enforce San Francisco\u2019s stay-at-home public health order.</p> <p>Among the items seized were DJ equipment, fog machines, gambling machines stocked with cash, pool tables, bins of liquor, cases of beer and bar furniture.</p> <p>The San Francisco Chronicle <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/Coronavirus-Illegal-nightclub-in-SF-used-15198057.php#\">reported </a>that in early February, Mariano Pena Lezama leased a pink warehouse in the city\u2019s Bayview industrial district, saying he intended to use it for storage his janitorial company. But within days he turned it over to operators to use for an illicit venue.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a party every night,\u201d Monte Travis, an attorney for the building\u2019s landlords, told the Chronicle.</p> <p>The building\u2019s landlords worked with law enforcement to close the club, according to the news outlet, telling investigators they were upset about being duped and concerned the building could be at risk of fire like the one that killed 36 people who attended a party in the Ghost Ship warehouse in Oakland in 2016.</p> <p>Enforcement actions by the city attorney\u2019s office, which handles civil matters, can lead to fines and citations. Separately, the district attorney can bring misdemeanor charges against those who willfully violate public health orders, said John Cot\u00e9, the press secretary for the city attorney.</p> <p>\u201cThe operators of this illegal club senselessly put lives at risk in a time when our city is doing everything within our means to slow the spread of this pandemic and safeguard the health and wellbeing of the public,\u201d said the city police chief, William Scott, whose officers executed the search warrant.</p> <p>\u201cLet this case be a reminder that we will take action against those who knowingly violate the public health order and endanger the health and safety of our residents.\u201d</p> <p>Those headed to nightclubs aren\u2019t the only people who\u2019ve been admonished for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/french-police-turn-back-private-jet-of-holidaymakers-from-uk\">testing lockdown measures</a>.

  "<p>Running for high office in the midst of a pandemic has forced candidates in South Korea to abandon tried and tested campaigning methods, as the country prepares to become the first to hold a national election since the start of the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>With a few exceptions, they have swapped handshakes for elbow bumps and delivered speeches from behind masks to small groups rather than hold mass rallies. Kissing babies is out of the question.</p> <p>In less tumultuous times, the 15 April elections would have been dominated by job creation, wages and North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons programme. But they have been overshadowed by president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/09/moon-jae-in-the-south-korean-pragmatist-who-would-be-presidentc\">Moon Jae-in</a>\u2019s response to the pandemic.</p> <p>Early indications are that the virus has failed to deter voters, with predictions of a record turnout by the time all the votes for the 300-seat national assembly have been cast on Wednesday evening. On Friday, more than 5 million people cast their ballots early \u2013 a record high since advance voting was introduced seven years ago.</p> <p>Like millions of his compatriots, Moon arrived at a polling station wearing a mask, and was not allowed to vote until he had passed a temperature test, washed his hands and put on plastic gloves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cdea811a7e5e3cfde8200ac6addbc8152106fb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cdea811a7e5e3cfde8200ac6addbc8152106fb1/0_109_2870_1722/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A candidate from the main opposition United Future party at a subway station in Seoul.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A candidate from the main opposition United Future party at a subway station in Seoul.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YONHAP/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>South Korea has won praise from the World Health Organization for its success in bringing the outbreak under control, with more than a dozen world leaders seeking Seoul\u2019s advice on quarantine measures and requesting test kits. Nearly 60% of survey respondents approved of Moon\u2019s response to the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cIn times of a national disaster or crisis, the ruling camp would usually be on the defensive. But the recent slowing of the outbreak appears to have turned the tide in their favour,\u201d said Yang Seung-ham, a professor of political science at Yonsei University in Seoul.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/south-korea\">South Korea</a> has brought daily known infections to about 50 or below, down from the late February peak of more than 900, through a combination of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/covid-19-south-koreans-keep-calm-and-carry-on-testing\">aggressive testing</a>, monitoring, social distancing and strict quarantine for overseas arrivals. It has had a <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/south-korea/\">total of 10,537 cases</a>, with 217 deaths, as of the afternoon of Monday 13 April, according to the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. Well over 7,000 infected people have recovered from the illness.</p> <p>The country\u2019s response is expected to give Moon\u2019s Democratic party of Korea an unexpected boost, after a year of political scandals and criticism of his record on jobs and young people\u2019s living standards. His approval ratings reached a 16-month high last week, a poll by researchers at Realmeter showed, while his party\u2019s popularity was 15% higher than the conservative main opposition United Future party.</p> <p>\u201cWe were terrified several weeks ago, but thanks to the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus, we think we will do much better than we had previously thought,\u201d a senior ruling party official said.</p> <p>The virus has transformed the mechanics of voting for millions of South Koreans amid concern that polling stations could trigger a second wave of infections, just as the country appears to be bringing the outbreak under control.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95db811bdc4e6ccef78b7ac45992b01bb1e3874a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95db811bdc4e6ccef78b7ac45992b01bb1e3874a/0_0_4967_2982/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lee Nak-yon (centre) of the ruling Democratic party campaigns in Gumi, South Korea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee Nak-yon (centre) of the ruling Democratic party campaigns in Gumi, South Korea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YONHAP/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More than 3,500 polling stations have been disinfected and all voters are required to use hand sanitiser and wear a mask and gloves.

  "<p>A reduction in the number of new confirmed cases of coronavirus in Australia has coincided with a decline in the number of people returning from overseas. Australian health authorities in a number of states and territories are now easing up previous restrictions on testing so that at-risk workers or those in hotspots can be tested for possible community transmission.</p> <p>If you suspect you have coronavirus in Australia and want to get tested, here\u2019s a guide to the criteria in each state and territory. In all jurisdictions you remain eligible for testing if you are showing symptoms and you have recently been overseas or been in contact with a confirmed case.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/07/social-distancing-rules-australia-coronavirus-strict-new-laws-legal-illegal-state-physical-restrictions-guidelines-explained-nsw-victoria-qld-queensland-act-sa-wa-two-person-rule\">Australia's coronavirus social distancing rules explained: state by state guidelines</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>New South Wales</h2> <p>People with fever or flu-like symptoms in parts of Sydney and regional NSW can get tested due to concerns about clusters in those areas. In Sydney that includes Waverley, Woollahra, Randwick, Dee Why, Manly, Ryde, Blacktown, Penrith, Liverpool, Westmead, Cumberland, Macquarie Park and Sydney\u2019s Inner West. In regional NSW it includes Broken Hill, Lake Macquarie, the Manning Valley, Nowra, south Nowra, Byron Bay and Port Macquarie.<strong> </strong>You also meet NSW testing criteria if you have a fever or respiratory illness and live in a high-risk location (aged care facilities, boarding houses etc), are an aged care or healthcare worker, identify as Aboriginal in a regional or remote community or have been referred by a GP for testing.</p> <h2>Victoria</h2> <p>Victorians who are over 65, school teachers, childcare workers and firefighters who attend medical emergencies can also get tested if they have symptoms. Healthcare workers, police, and aged care workers were already eligible to get tested.</p> <h2>Queensland</h2> <p>The Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young announced on Monday testing would be done in hotspots on the Gold Coast, Brisbane and in Cairns after 32 cases where the source of the transmission was unknown. The state\u2019s other testing criteria includes people with a fever or respiratory illness and living in a high-risk location (aged care facilities, boarding houses etc), aged care or healthcare workers, and those who identify as Aboriginal in a regional or remote community.</p> <h2>Western Australia</h2> <p>Western Australia expanded its testing last week to include any member of the general public who presents at a Covid-19 clinic with both a fever and an acute respiratory infection. High-risk workers with either of those conditions can get tested, and anyone in a high-risk setting like an aged care facility or detention centre where two or more people have either symptom can get tested.</p> <h2>ACT</h2> <p>The ACT has random testing at Weston Creek and a drive-through testing clinic at Epic (Exhibition Park in Canberra), where anyone with coronavirus symptoms can get tested. </p> <h2>South Australia</h2> <p>You can get tested if you have symptoms and have travelled overseas or interstate in the past 14 days, if you have symptoms and have been in contact with a confirmed case, or if you have symptoms and you are a health or aged care worker.</p> <p>The state is also asking people with symptoms who have been at Adelaide Airport, Angaston, Nuriootpa, Tanuda, Lyndoch or Williamstown in the past 14 days to get tested.</p> <h2>Tasmania</h2> <p>The existing conditions remain in place. That is, only people with symptoms who have travelled internationally or interstate recently or have had contact with a confirmed case can get tested. However, health and aged care workers with both a respiratory illness and fever can get also tested.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/05/like-preparing-for-war-australias-hospitals-brace-for-coronavirus-peak\">'Like preparing for war': Australia's hospitals brace for coronavirus peak</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Northern Territory</h2> <p>You can get tested if you have returned from interstate or overseas in the past 14 days and develop a respiratory illness, or have been in contact with a confirmed case, or have severe community-acquired pneumonia and there is no clear cause, or you are a healthcare worker who has a respiratory illness and a fever.</p> <h2>Community transmission</h2> <p>On Sunday, Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said the biggest concern in Australia was the community transmission, which accounts for about 10% of cases nationally.</p> <p>\u201cI may sound like a broken record at times but community transmission is what worries me most of all,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThose are the reason we have brought in the social distancing measures and all the measures to stop the spread.\u201d</p> <p>He said Australia was in a good place, and achieving good control because the community was mostly complying with what had been asked.

  "<p>France\u2019s president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/emmanuel-macron\">Emmanuel Macron</a>, has announced that the country will remain in coronavirus lockdown for another month.</p> <p>In a national address on Monday evening, he said that only by respecting the confinement rules would the battle against Covid-19 be won.</p> <p>Macron said France would start returning to normal life on 11 May, if citizens were \u201ccivic, responsible and respected the rules\u201d \u2013 and if the number of cases of coronavirus continued to drop.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to continue our efforts; the more the rules are respected the more lives will be saved. That is why I am announcing the strict lockdown will continue until Monday 11 May.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI appreciate the effort I am asking of you,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThere is new hope but nothing is won at the moment \u2026 the epidemic is not under control.\u201d</p> <p>It was Macron\u2019s fourth televised address since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis and expectations were high, not just that he would make concrete announcements but that he would give some direction and reassurance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=France\" data-alt=\"French deaths\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=France\">French deaths</a> </figure>  <p>Hospital admissions and death rates appear to have levelled off \u2013 though as J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon, the head of France\u2019s health authority, has repeated, they remain at a \u201chigh level\u201d \u2013 and the French were keen to know if and when the four-week lockdown restrictions may be eased.</p> <p>In a 30-minute speech marked by a tone of humility, Macron gave an explanation, a response and a calendar for the next few weeks.</p> <p>He admitted several times that there had been failings in dealing with the pandemic, particularly with the lack of masks and equipment, but promised that by 11 May there would be enough tests for \u201cthe elderly, health workers and the most vulnerable\u201d and masks for everyone.</p> <p>\u201cWere we prepared? No. Clearly not enough. There were failings, there was a lack of material,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Macron added that the coming four weeks would be used to obtain more tests, masks and equipment, and organise financial aid not only for businesses but for those families in a precarious situation.</p> <p>\u201cThese are difficult days and we are now feeling afraid and anxious for our parents and ourselves,\u201d Macron said.</p> <p>From 11 May, creches, schools, colleges and lyc\u00e9es will be \u201cprogressively opened\u201d as a priority, he said.</p> <p>\u201cMany children are missing out of school and there is an inequality in that there are those who don\u2019t have access to the internet and can\u2019t be helped by their parents.\u201d</p> <p>While schools will open from 11 May, Macrons said restaurants, cafes, hotels, museums and cultural sites must stay closed and large festivals and events may only be allowed after mid-July.</p> <p>Macron made reference to EU solidarity and the need to support African countries, including the possibility of cancelling their debt.</p> <p>He said France\u2019s borders with non-EU countries would remain closed. This is not thought to include the UK, as Britain is still in the Brexit transition period.</p> <p>He concluded: \u201cWe have to reinvent ourselves, and me first of all \u2026 We are vulnerable. When can we hope for an end to this? I understand you have many questions and I would like to answer all of them. But I say in all humility, we don\u2019t have definitive answers today.</p> <p>\u201cWe will share with you what we know and what we don\u2019t know, we will come out of this, but we still have several months of living with this virus.\u201d</p> <p>Macron added: \u201cTake care of yourselves and each other and we will get through this.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In the space of a few weeks of coronavirus lockdown, England has acquired a million-strong network of social volunteers \u2013 surpassing demand and prompting speculation: is this a new sign of social solidarity, and can the newly acquired community spirit survive?</p> <p>The extraordinary popularity of the NHS volunteer scheme, which 750,000 people signed up to using a phone app, three times as many as were expected, has been repeated at the country\u2019s volunteer centres, which have registered an estimated 250,000 extra people in the past few weeks.</p> <p>Those numbers come on the back of the astonishing rise of informal mutual aid \u201cgood neighbour\u201d organisations \u2013 hyper-local groups that keep volunteers in touch via social media. There are more than 4,300 such groups connecting an estimated 3 million people.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of the popularity of volunteering is about people trying to get a degree of agency and control in their life when they feel so helpless. Somehow, staying at home, even though that is the main thing you can do to help, does not feel enough,\u201d said Jackie Rosenberg, the chief executive of One Westminster community action, which has had about 2,500 applicants in recent weeks.</p> <p>While a typical volunteer centre would anticipate about 100 new applicants in the course of a normal March, many have reported being overwhelmed in recent weeks by demand from thousands of people keen to offer their services to the community for free.</p> <p>Staffordshire volunteer centre has been receiving up to 100 inquiries a day from potential volunteers. Croydon Volunteer Centre signed up 900 in the first two weeks of April. Cornwall has had more than 3,000 inquiries over the past month, and <a href=\"https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/18359137.coronavirus-1-005-people-volunteer-dorset/\">Dorset</a> more than 1,000. Havering volunteer centre in Romford, Essex took <a href=\"https://www.romfordrecorder.co.uk/news/havering-charity-sees-500-people-volunteer-in-10-days-during-coronavirus-crisis-1-6599886\">half a year\u2019s volunteers</a> in 10 days.</p> <p>Volunteering Matters, a national volunteer charity, reported that 3,000 people had applied to its website in the past fortnight alone. It normally expects about 20 to 30 applications a week. It has also had more than 80 businesses come forward to volunteer.</p> <p>The surfeit of volunteers has come at a point where lockdown and physical distancing mean there is a relatively limited range of activities they can do. Most available roles cover shopping, dog walking, food parcel packing, patient transport and \u201ccheck and chat\u201d phone calls with older people in self-isolation.</p> <p>There is speculation that England now has more volunteers that it has roles for, with some people on the NHS scheme complaining that they have not had enough to do. The Royal Voluntary Service (RVS), which runs the scheme, said it was too early to say whether there were too many or too few volunteers and no one should worry about not being given tasks.</p> <p>Before the coronavirus outbreak, volunteer levels had barely shifted nationally for years. There is now hope that one of the legacies of the pandemic will be an injection of relative youth into what had become a largely older-age volunteer community.</p> <p>The recruitment of volunteers on this scale has not been seen in the UK since the second world war, when more than 1 million registered with the RVS to help with the evacuation of children from the cities during the Blitz. There have been some smaller voluntary efforts though, for example, the 70,000 who helped with the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s by no means unique. You do see these outbursts of desire to help your neighbour,\u201d said Dr Justin Davis-Smith, a senior lecturer in voluntary sector management at Cass Business School. \u201cThere\u2019s a real tradition of volunteering, which comes out of national stress and tension.\u201d</p> <p>Jane Ide, the chief executive of NAVCA, said: \u201cTo know that around a quarter of a million people have made themselves available to the thousands of local charities and voluntary groups working right on the frontline of supporting those in need is a powerful sign that even in the face of a crisis that affects every one of us, the human desire to help others is unquenchable.\u201d</p> <p>It is too early to know whether the million new volunteers will stay active \u2013 the Olympic mini-surge lasted two years before returning to normal levels \u2013 and wise heads know that managing a large community of new volunteers, all eager for action straight away, is never straightforward. But, for now, they have the capacity and energy to spare.</p>",

It exposes a woeful governance structure that Albion Rovers and Cowdenbeath have influence on outcomes for Celtic and Hearts and vice versa.</p> <p>By an uncanny quirk, three clubs represented on the SPFL board would appear to benefit from a yes vote; Motherwell to the tune of third in the Premiership, Hamilton in respect of guaranteed safety and Brechin \u2013 this is the most extraordinary aspect \u2013 spared a relegation play-off when rooted at the bottom of League Two.</p> <p>Rangers have a man on the SPFL board but in a football sense are in the rare position of having precious little to lose nor gain with the league being abandoned; it hasn\u2019t prevented a row of epic proportions with the league.</p> <p>Dundee\u2019s vote, a key one, was missing as the SPFL took the unprecedented step of telling the public how 39 of 42 clubs had voted on Friday evening. By Saturday Inverness chief executive Scot Gardiner confirmed a \u201cNo\u201d ballot paper, signed and dated by Dundee\u2019s managing director, was valid as circulated around fellow clubs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ba39fed0e5fc192ae02e1a40ca299f8ec4b91d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ba39fed0e5fc192ae02e1a40ca299f8ec4b91d8/0_0_2346_1407/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hearts owner Ann Budge standing in the crowd at a football match.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Hearts owner, Ann Budge, has questioned the role of the SPFL board in the \u2018decision-making process\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart Wallace/BPI/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>MacLennan\u2019s explanation, 24 hours later, insisted Dundee \u201cattempted to submit a voting slip, which did not reach the SPFL until late that evening\u201d. The league chairman added: \u201cEarlier, at 6pm on Friday, that club had confirmed in writing to the SPFL that any attempted vote from that club should not be considered as cast.\u201d So there we have it; Dundee somehow knew their vote wasn\u2019t going to land imminently and, in the meantime, asked the league to disregard it anyway.</p> <p>It is perfectly plausible that an electronic firewall blocked Dundee\u2019s email. Far more concerning is the as yet unexplained events and communications that caused the club to back off from its casting. Dundee were obliged \u2013 by everyone apart from the SPFL \u2013 to resubmit precisely the same paper. In not doing so, and somehow being cast as kingmakers, Dundee and the SPFL have fatally undermined the outcome of this resolution. It simply cannot be taken seriously.</p> <p>The SPFL\u2019s desperation to have the resolution passed was laid bare last week. \u201cThe alternative is further weeks, and possibly months, of uncertainty and financial hardship for dozens of clubs which are desperately looking for a way to survive,\u201d said a spokesman. This language appeared needlessly aggressive, even before the Hearts owner, Ann Budge, raised the question of \u201cwhether the board is attempting to unduly influence the members\u2019 decision-making process\u201d. Clubs are, surely, allowed to vote as they see fit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/11/rangers-spfl-neil-doncaster-suspension-farcical-vote\">Rangers call for SPFL chief Doncaster to be suspended over \u2018farcical\u2019 vote</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rangers\u2019 central grievance, never understated, relates to evidence in their possession which they allege \u201craises serious concerns surrounding the SPFL\u2019s processes relating to its stewardship of the voting on the resolution presented to member clubs\u201d.</p> <p>MacLennan has compelled Rangers to hand over said paperwork.

  "<p>One of southern Europe\u2019s most important staples, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/feb/08/does-it-matter-which-quality-olive-oil-i-buy-kitchen-aide\">olive oil</a>, is under pressure from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/08/europes-olive-trees-threatened-spread-deadly-bacteria\">potentially deadly disease</a> that new research shows could infect nearly all of the productive areas of Italy, Greece and Spain.</p> <p>Economic losses could be as high as \u20ac5bn over the next 50 years for Italy, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/22/italy-farmers-olive-trees-xylella-blight-cow-dung-puglia\">at least 1m trees have already died</a>, if nothing is done to halt the spread of the disease and olive groves are not replanted, <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1912206117\">the study found</a>. In Spain, losses could total \u20ac17bn over the same period, and Greece could suffer to the tune of about \u20ac2bn.</p> <p>Drastic action would be required to halt the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/25/flying-cameras-to-spot-lethal-disease-sweeping-through-worlds-olive-groves\">spread</a>, including felling seemingly healthy olive trees. However, if preventive measures are taken, and if orchards can be replanted with resistant strains of olive, the economic impact could be cut to as little as \u20ac10m a year in Italy, with proportionally similar benefits in Spain and Greece. The three countries represent 95% of European production.</p> <p>About 17% of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/05/italy-may-depend-on-olive-imports-from-april-scientist-says\">Italy\u2019s olive producing areas</a> are currently estimated to be infected with the disease, olive quick decline syndrome, which has become colloquially known as olive leprosy and has also struck in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/09/deadly-olive-tree-disease-spreads-france\">France</a>, Spain and Portugal. There is no practical cure for the disease, though work to develop resistant varieties is under way.</p> <p>The researchers analysed to what extent the climatic conditions in each of the three countries was suitable for the spread of <em>Xylella fastidiosa</em>, the bacterium that causes olive quick decline syndrome. The first cases of the disease, which is transmitted by insects and causes delayed growth, withering leaves, declining fruit and the eventual death of the tree, were found in Italy in 2013.</p> <p>They found that most current olive production in all three countries falls within the range of climates in which the bacteria can be expected to flourish, with between 85% and 99% of all producing areas susceptible. The spread of the disease is currently 5km a year, but could be reduced to a little over 1km a year with appropriate measures.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cf8f0ca6691cbbd413fbdb3370e17e6ada2e4579\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf8f0ca6691cbbd413fbdb3370e17e6ada2e4579/0_27_5464_3276/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stricken olive tree\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A stricken olive tree in a field belonging to the Mediterranean Agronomic Institute (CNR) in Apulia, Italy, used for research into the disease.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Onians/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some of the measures likely to be needed to slow the spread of the disease, however, will cause hardship and will not be popular. They involve tree felling around areas where the disease has gained a foothold to create a cordon sanitaire, needed because many trees can be infected without showing outward symptoms of the disease. But the scientists noted that when these control measures were tried, they \u201cresulted in great societal unrest in the affected region\u201d.</p> <p>Preparing for plant diseases, even of vital crops, is \u201ca notoriously difficult problem\u201d, said Kevin Schneider, of Wageningen University in the Netherlands, lead author of the paper <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1912206117\">published </a><a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1912206117\">in the </a><a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1912206117\">journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>. \u201cThere are clear guidelines and protocols enacted to prepare as much as possible against the introduction of harmful plant diseases. [But] some species can change ecosystems, some have economic impact, and some do not establish successfully at all and in turn do not cause impact.\u201d</p> <p>He told the Guardian that farmers and governments in the affected regions should heed scientific advice. \u201cFarmers need to stay vigilant and adhere to the imposed mitigation measures. Government interventions are warranted with regard to economic considerations, and government support for adaptation strategies, such as [developing and propagating] resistant varieties, is important.\u201d</p> <p>The losses are not just economic, he added: \u201cWe did not account for the cultural heritage value associated with these trees. Some of the European olive trees are hundreds of years old and there is currently no practical cure under field conditions for the disease. I think aiming at containing the pathogen and finding ways to adapt to the situation is certainly a good idea.\u201d</p> <p>It is unlikely to be possible to eradicate the disease altogether, the researchers concluded, owing to the size of the area infected, the problem of symptomless but infectious host plants, and the fact that the tight network of olive orchards in Apulia in Italy will serve as a reservoir.</p> <p>In 2017, the production value of olives in Europe was about \u20ac2.4bn, and for olive oil \u20ac6.7bn.</p>",

OCE was set up by a series of 1990s ballot measures \u201c<a href=\"https://oce.oregon.gov/content/OCE_About_Us.asp\">to operate like a private sector business</a>\u201d; on average inmates <a href=\"https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2019/apr/2/oregon-prison-industry-program-nets-record-285-million-prisoners-earn-125hour/\">reportedly </a>get paid $1.25 an hour working for the program.</p> <p>Although the inmate wrote that TRCI has introduced some social distancing measures at the prison, including by staggering inmate exercise and dining and barring outside visitors (\u201cno visitors, no education teachers, no church services\u201d), he argued that these efforts are being undone by the working conditions in OCE\u2019s wood shop and its laundry facility.</p> <p>Work at the facilities has continued even after <a href=\"https://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/23/coronavirus-gov-kate-brown-orders-oregonians-stay-home-combat-covid-19/2899879001/\">proclamations</a> by the governor regarding social distancing, and as major clients like schools and outdoor recreational facilities are on lockdown.</p> <p>\u201cSeveral laundry workers and wood shop workers have been sick with colds but none have been tested only examined by nurses and told to stay at home until they feel better,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>According to his letter, inmates at work at the facilities are not able to practice adequate social distancing, and are being lined up and patted down on their way in and out of the workshops, with some but not all supervisors wearing gloves. They worry that workers at the laundry facility are handling hospital linen that is potentially contaminated with the virus.</p> <p>In the OCE break room, he said, inmates are \u201cshoulder to shoulder\u201d, and unable to socially distance.

In an effort to continue influencing the Democratic platform, he will remain on the ballot in states with remaining primaries to gain delegates.</p> \n<p>Biden, a former Delaware senator and vice-president, now the presumptive Democratic nominee for the White House, thanked Sanders for his support.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been the most powerful voice for a fair and more just America,\u201d Biden told Sanders. \u201cYou don\u2019t get enough credit, Bernie, for being the voice that forces us to take a hard look in the mirror.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cIf I am the nominee \u2013 which it looks like now you just made me \u2013 I really need you, not just to win the campaign but to govern,\u201d Biden told Sanders.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/07/joe-biden-skeptical-sanders-supporters\">\u2018I know what's at stake\u2019: can Biden win over skeptical Sanders supporters?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Biden still faces deep skepticism from young progressive voters, many of whom supported Sanders by lopsided margins. On Monday, Biden and Sanders announced that their staff had set up six taskforces to help find common ground on policy differences. Those groups will cover the economy, education, criminal justice, immigration, climate change and healthcare.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s no great secret out there, Joe, that you and I have our differences. And we\u2019re not going to paper them over, that\u2019s real,\u201d Sanders said. But he expressed an optimism that the working groups would be able to forge policy agreements and concessions.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1249770830373978112\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Unity. <a href=\"https://t.co/cZxaRCY8jr\">pic.twitter.com/cZxaRCY8jr</a></p>\u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1249770830373978112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 13, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Determined not to repeat the mistakes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\">2016</a>, when the party struggled to unify, Biden has already started to ramp up his outreach to the party\u2019s left. In recent weeks, he has engaged top progressive organizations and movement leaders representing a range of Democratic causes from climate change to racial justice.</p> \n<p>He has also made overt gestures, adopting a plan by his former rival, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/elizabeth-warren\">Elizabeth Warren</a>, to overhaul the consumer bankruptcy system, embracing elements of Sanders\u2019 tuition-free college proposal and unveiling a plan to <a href=\"https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/joe-biden-outlines-new-steps-to-ease-economic-burden-on-working-people-e3e121037322\">lower</a> the age of eligibility for the Medicare government health insurance program for seniors from 65 to 60.</p> \n<p>Though there are indications Biden will continue to move left on issues like climate change, he is unlikely to adopt Medicare for All, Sanders\u2019 signature policy. Asked recently if the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> changed his position on universal healthcare, Biden said it hadn\u2019t and argued expanding the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/25/obama-healthcare-law-upheld-supreme-court\">Affordable Care Act</a> was still the most effective and efficient way to insure more Americans.</p> \n<p>In a sign of the work that lies ahead, the progressive New York congresswoman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alexandria-ocasio-cortez\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>, one of Sanders\u2019 most high-profile surrogates, called Biden\u2019s Medicare proposal \u201calmost insulting\u201d and said he would have to go much further if he expects a full-throated endorsement.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe whole process of coming together should be uncomfortable for everyone involved \u2013 that\u2019s how you know it\u2019s working,\u201d she said <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/us/politics/aoc-progressives-joe-biden.html\">in an interview with the New York Times</a>. \u201cAnd if Biden is only doing things he\u2019s comfortable with, then it\u2019s not enough.\u201d</p> \n<p>There are also limits to Sanders\u2019 ability to deliver the support of his devoted followers, particularly those attracted to his outsider status as an independent railing against the political establishment. Though Sanders has been careful not to attack Biden in personal terms, some of his most visible backers continue to assail the former vice-president, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/1249765850531405827\">raising questions </a>about his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/1242577865331412993\">mental acuity</a> and overall fitness \u2013 a line of attack that Trump has also used against his likely opponent.</p> \n<p>Despite a hard-fought primary, the former competitors and one-time Senate colleagues displayed sincere affection for one another \u2013 a warm relationship Sanders never shared with his 2016 rival, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cI appreciate your friendship, and I promise you I will not let you down,\u201d Biden told Sanders.</p> \n<p>In reply, Sanders said: \u201cI know you are the kind of guy who is going to be inclusive. You want to bring people in \u2013 even people who disagree with you.\u201d</p> \n<p>After exchanging questions on raising the minimum wage, and the US economy, they joked that they should end the live-cast by playing a game of chess.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll bore everybody for a few hours,\u201d Sanders said.</p>",
  "<p>MPs are expected to be asked to approve plans for a \u201chybrid parliament\u201d when the Easter recess is over next week, but not a move to full \u201cdigital democracy\u201d.</p> \n<p>The new procedures are likely to involve many MPs submitting questions to ministers via video conference during departmental questions, statements and urgent questions.</p> \n<p>But MPs who have been involved in talks on how parliament can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/mar/19/work-at-home-coronavirus-office-self-isolating\">adapt</a> its proceedings to the need for social distancing do not think the Commons could become fully virtual, and they have found it harder to imagine how legislation could be debated and voted on without MPs attending the chamber.</p> \n<p>The details of the plans are still being worked on this week. The House of Commons commission, the cross-party body in charge of Commons administration, is due to meet on Thursday to consider options, and it is expected that MPs will be asked to vote in favour of the new procedures when they return to Westminster next Tuesday.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>According to one MP familiar with the commission\u2019s discussions, what is being proposed will amount to a hybrid parliament. He explained: \u201cThere will be some members in the chamber, and there will be some members who will be contributing digitally.\u201d</p> \n<p>Throughout the recess, parliament\u2019s digital services team has been putting in place technology that would allow this to work and now insiders are confident that question sessions in the Commons, such as PMQs, could involve many MPs participating by submitting questions electronically, using <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/31/zoom-booms-as-demand-for-video-conferencing-tech-grows-in-coronavirus-outbreak\">video conferencing technology</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe will have very, very slimmed-down proceedings \u2013 with just a skeleton group of ministers and MPs in the house,\u201d said another commission source.</p> \n<p>Opposition parties are comfortable with these plans, although there is far less agreement about how the Commons can continue to debate and vote on legislation in an era of physical distancing. Commons debates normally involve speakers taking spontaneous interventions from MPs, which would be hard to facilitate via video conferencing, and MPs have always resisted attempts to get them to vote electronicall instead of in person in the division lobbies.</p> \n<p>Before the Easter recess the parties agreed to limit the number of divisions they called on legislation and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/04/sir-lindsay-hoyle-promises-calm-after-being-elected-speaker\">Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons Speaker</a>, proposed getting MPs to vote in smaller groups, which would have meant a division taking up to 40 minutes, not 15 minutes as now.</p> \n<p>But these are not seen as long-term solutions to the problems created by coronavirus. In a letter to the Speaker sent last week, Karen Bradley, the chair of the Commons procedure committee, said her committee did not view these plans to limit the number of divisions as sustainable.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>She said: \u201cEvery colleague is entitled to express an opinion \u2026 in debate and in the lobbies. Members of the committee have expressed concerns that the time taken in divisions under the social distancing procedures which you have announced will inhibit colleagues from testing the will of the house as they are entitled to do.\u201d</p> \n<p>Bradley also said in her letter to Hoyle that, although some MPs agreed that they should be staying away from parliament to set an example, others thought that much of what happened in the chamber \u201ccannot be replicated by virtual means\u201d and that it was necessary for MPs to continue to visit their workplace \u201cin the same way as other key workers\u201d.</p>",

But perhaps what we missed above all was the promise and the hope, the sense of renewal and rebirth, the first chilly pint of the summer, the conviction that finally, this would be the year you made it to Wantage Road.</p> <p>Instead: nothing. A whispering void. The first seven rounds of the championship have already been called off. It\u2019s probably safe to say they won\u2019t be rescheduled. The talk is that with the shutdown poised to endure well into the summer, this year\u2019s competition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/04/england-cricketers-willing-to-dig-deep-but-county-game-will-be-hit-hard\" title=\"\">will be scrapped entirely</a> in order to ensure the \u201cmost financially important forms of the game\u201d \u2013 essentially, England and the Twenty20 Blast \u2013 can be prioritised.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c364e0965ed3bbb8e7a7f927ef5cb4cdf14577b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c364e0965ed3bbb8e7a7f927ef5cb4cdf14577b/0_162_4928_2956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans watch Yorkshire play Surrey from their folding chairs at Scarborough last summer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fans watch Yorkshire play Surrey from their folding chairs at Scarborough last summer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allan McKenzie/SWpix.com/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At which point: what? The simplest answer is that, like most of the other events that have fallen to Covid\u201119, you simply skip a year and start afresh in 2021. But this would be to overlook the many aspects in which the championship is not like other events.</p> <p>In a way, it\u2019s unique. It\u2019s a competition that does not generate significant revenue, indeed it haemorrhages it in vast sums to the point where there are a number of counties who are quietly relieved not to be playing it. Unless you\u2019re watching extremely closely, it creates neither buzz nor water-cooler moments. It does not fill acres of broadcasting time. Sky are not banging down the doors of the ECB demanding it be played at all costs. It is not part of the national conversation and will not be part of our collective healing process.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/04/england-cricketers-willing-to-dig-deep-but-county-game-will-be-hit-hard\">England cricketers willing to dig deep but county game will be hit hard | Vic Marks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The entire point of the County Championship, insofar as there is one, is to exist. It provides an ambient background hum to a busy season, quietly develops the next generation of international players, offers immeasurable comfort to the millions who will never set foot inside a ground and the thousands who do. In other words, it serves no wider purpose than simply to happen. And so when it doesn\u2019t happen, the effect is more seismic and disturbing than simply scratching off one Boat Race, one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/01/wimbledon-2020-cancelled-response-coronavirus-pandemic-tennis\" title=\"\">Wimbledon</a>, one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/01/tour-de-france-in-doubt-uci-announce-cycling-racing-suspension-until-june-coronavirus\" title=\"\">Tour de France</a>. The temptation, rather, is to wonder whether it will ever recover.</p> <p>This is after all a competition that has been tinkered to death \u2013 formats adulterated, schedules scrambled, rules tweaked, teams assembled and dissolved mid-season, whether through international availability or white\u2011ball blocks \u2013 only for that death to never materialise. This has generated an impression of timelessness and permanence, of an institution that can withstand pretty much anything you throw at it.</p> <p>But pandemic and penury have served up a starker, harsher reality. The talk coming from Lord\u2019s now is of \u201ckeeping the lights on\u201d, of redoubled priorities and focusing on what really matters. Where does a competition that stretches from April to September, takes up 14 weeks in the calendar, attracts tiny crowds and no broadcast income, fit into this new landscape? For decades the sport\u2019s administrators have treated four-day cricket like the unloved jar of piccalilli in the back of the fridge: ignored, untended, shoved to the forgotten peripheries. Now catastrophe may just embolden them to finish what they started.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>And really, this is about far more than one competition, one format, even one sport. It\u2019s about what happens when the doors are finally flung open and society clanks back into gear. What we choose to value. What it feels acceptable to fight for. Is it possible to aspire to more than simply keeping the lights on? Is it horrendously privileged to lionise the 18-county system and a proper first-class competition and sunny afternoons at Bristol and Hove when an entire sport is in crisis? Or are we doomed to a grim fight for survival, public bodies desperately trying to claw back lost income in increasingly undignified ways?</p> <p>\u201cWe must face the fact,\u201d said the secretary of Warwickshire at their annual end-of-season dinner, \u201cthat we are providing a spectacle the public does not want.\u201d That was in 1967. Then as now the championship offered the best, richest, most varied domestic red-ball cricket available anywhere on Earth. And yet decline \u2013 or at least the sensation of it \u2013 had long since taken root. Perhaps, in hindsight, the reckoning was coming all along. Perhaps one man\u2019s moment of chaos is another man\u2019s moment of clarity. Perhaps I should really have got to Wantage Road while I still had the chance.</p>",

  "<p>Hundreds of thousands of non-essential employees in Spain have returned to work as European countries grapple with the question of when lockdown restrictions should be eased amid fears of a renewed spike in the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n<p>Police handed workers masks at transport hubs in the capital, Madrid, on Monday and businesses in the construction and manufacturing sectors tentatively reopened, after the government relaxed some lockdown measures put in place two weeks ago that confined most people to their homes.</p> \n<p>The controversial return to work for an estimated 300,000 non-essential staff got off to a slow start. Monday is a public holiday in much of the country, including some of the most populous regions such as Catalonia and Valencia. Few commuters were visible at Madrid\u2019s usually bustling Atocha railway station.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/spanish-pm-survival-eu-rests-response-coronavirus-crisis\">prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez</a>, has insisted the country remains firmly in lockdown despite the easing of some restrictions. Shops, bars and public houses will remain closed until at least 26 April. The health ministry has called on those returning to work to stagger arrival times and to wear masks where physical distancing is not possible.</p> \n<p>Regional leaders have criticised the move amid fears that the hard-fought public health gains of recent days may be lost. Spain\u2019s overnight death toll from the virus fell to 517 on Monday from 619 on Sunday, bringing the total death toll to 17,489, the health ministry said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Spain\" data-alt=\"Spain deaths graph\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Spain\">Spain deaths graph</a> \n</figure> \n<p>It was the smallest proportional daily increase since tracking began. Overall cases rose to 169,496 from 166,019. The health minister, Salvador Illa, said the epidemic had passed its peak. The challenge now was to consolidate the second stage of the struggle against the virus and to reduce new infections, he said.</p> \n<p>The trend across Europe appears to show a similar modest flattening of infection and death rates. Italy reported 566 deaths on Monday, 135 more than on Sunday. Almost half of the deaths \u2013 280 \u2013 were registered in Lombardy, the northern region worst affected by the virus.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-italy-new-york-death-tolls-slow-latest-updates\">Coronavirus latest news: death toll in Italy passes 20,000; more than 1.87m cases reported worldwide</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The civil protection authority said the number of people who are currently infected rose by 1,363 (1.3%) to 103,616, in a further sign that the curve is flattening. The number of intensive care beds in use continues to decline, as does the number of people hospitalised for the virus.</p> \n<p>European countries face the same dilemma as Spain: whether to ease some lockdown restrictions in order to salvage their battered economies, or to persevere with draconian measures until the decline in cases is conclusively achieved.</p> \n<p>Italy\u2019s government has set up a taskforce led by the former chief executive of Vodafone Vittorio Colao to navigate the country\u2019s exit from the coronavirus lockdown. The team of 17 will be responsible for devising a plan as part of \u201cphase two\u201d of the emergency.</p> \n<p>It includes Enrico Giovannini, a former labour minister and professor at Tor Vergata University of Rome, as well as other economists, businesspeople, lawyers, sociologists and psychologists. Italy\u2019s lockdown is in place until 4 May, after which the country is expected to gradually reopen.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, will decide on Wednesday whether to extend restrictions imposed in mid-March. They are due to expire on Sunday. The latest figures from the Robert Koch public health institute show the rate of infection slowing, with 2,537 new cases on Monday, taking the tally in Germany to 123,016.</p> \n<p>The country\u2019s Academy of Sciences Leopoldina has recommended a gradual relaxing of measures. It said schools should reopen as soon as possible, starting with primary and middle schools, followed by shops and restaurants. All government officials should return to work, it said.</p> \n<p>Austria is to allow small shops to reopen from Tuesday, and larger ones from 1 May. All restaurants and hotels are due to resume business from mid-May. Denmark will reopen schools and day care centres from Wednesday, although restrictions on public gatherings and on bars and restaurants remain.</p> \n<p> The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, urged caution over moves by countries to lift lockdown conditions. He said much was still unknown about the behaviour of the virus, and emphasised that case finding, testing and isolating was still crucial to controlling the outbreak.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-world-map-which-countries-have-the-most-cases-and-deaths\">Coronavirus world map: which countries have the most cases and deaths?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He said: \u201cWe know that in some countries, Covid-19 cases are doubling every three to four days. However, while Covid-19 accelerates very fast, it decelerates much more slowly. In other words, the way down is much slower than the way up.\u201d</p> \n<p>S\u00e1nchez said Spain\u2019s decision to reboot some sectors of the economy was taken following consultations with a committee of scientific experts. Any further winding \u2013 down would depend on gains made against the virus, he stressed. So far 500,000 people have been fined an average of \u20ac300 (\u00a3260) for breaking lockdown.</p> \n<p>In other developments:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Russia introduced a new digital permit system for anyone seeking to travel around Moscow during its lockdown. However, the website offering Muscovites a QR-code went offline just hours after launch. Moscow\u2019s mayor blamed an attack by foreign bots.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li><p>China reported 108 new cases, 98 of which were imported from overseas, its highest figure since early March.

The practice also poses a risk of cross-infection and makes proper monitoring impossible.</p> <p>A group of Australian researchers have been experimenting with a new device that could allow for a safer method of ventilator splitting, if it must be used in cases of \u201cextreme emergencies\u201d.</p> <p>The peer-reviewed study, <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/anae.15078\">published in the international journal Anaesthesia</a>, was led by Dr Alexander Clarke, of the Royal Women\u2019s Hospital in Melbourne, and Monash University\u2019s Dr Shaun Gregory.</p> <p>The study does not recommend ventilator splitting. But the researchers did have some success in addressing one of the key risks associated with the practice.</p> <p>They used a new device, built with common hospital parts, to act as a flow restrictor. The restrictor gives doctors some control over the air being delivered to different lungs.</p> <p>\u201cIt works by compensating for differences between patients, to an extent,\u201d Clarke told the Guardian. \u201cSo some patients need a lot of pressure, some patients don\u2019t need so much pressure. By putting in the clamp, you can decrease the amount of pressure that one person gets.\u201d</p> <p>The experiments were conducted in simulated environments, using test lungs. <br>The device allowed researchers to modify the pressure, flow and volume for each test lung.</p> <p>\u201cWe experimented with a few different devices to do this, and assembled some common hospital parts, that we should have available en-masse,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cThen we used some lung simulators, devices that share some of the characteristics of human lungs, and we used a standard ventilator in an intensive care unit, and took measurements using some engineering tools.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke said the results needed to be treated with caution, but were promising.</p> <p>\u201cGetting more ventilators is mostly a logistics problem. This is a stopgap measure for that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a device that none of us ever want to see used, and it\u2019s really just about something we can get up and running very quickly, using the parts you can scramble together.\u201d</p> <p>Gregory said the devices required further trials.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the discovery is promising, the use of this method in the clinical context has not been validated and we don\u2019t recommend its wider use without further trials,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are hopeful of one day being able to get great surety with this approach to ventilator splitting so we can help save lives in dire cases of emergency.\u201d</p>",

It said there was an \u201cabundant evidence of a hyper-factional atmosphere prevailing in party HQ in this period, which appears to have affected the expeditious and resolute handling of disciplinary complaints\u201d.</p> <p>It was intended to be submitted as an annex to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission inquiry into Labour\u2019s approach to dealing with antisemitism. It is understood that it will now not be submitted.</p> <p>The report was completed this year in the last months of Corbyn\u2019s leadership and its conclusions clash with complaints of whistleblowers, formerly working for Labour, who told BBC Panorama last year there had been political interference in the process from the top of the party under Corbyn.</p> <p>The report, seen by the Guardian, says it found no evidence of antisemitism complaints being treated differently from other forms of complaint, or of current or former staff being \u201cmotivated by antisemitic intent\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe have also asked for immediate sight of any legal advice the Labour party has already received about the report,\u201d Starmer and Rayner said in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cIn the meantime, we ask everyone concerned to refrain from drawing conclusions before the investigation is complete and we will be asking the general secretary to put measures in place to protect the welfare of party members and party staff who are concerned or affected by this report.\u201d</p> <p>The previous Labour leadership\u2019s handling of allegations of antisemitism against party members overshadowed parts of the 2019 general election campaign.

At the time, the horse was the champion three-year-old colt in the country.</p> <p>Servis pleaded not guilty to the charge in a New York court in March.</p> <p>But in response, the Jockey Club of Saudi Arabia (JCSA) said it had told all winners that the prize pool was being withheld while it conducted its own investigation. It has hired French officials to conduct drug testing on samples taken from horses that competed in the Saudi Cup event, and says the findings will be released in due course.</p> <p>\u201cJCSA will withhold payment of prize money due to all connections of horses placed in prize-winning positions in the Saudi Cup, race 8,\u201d a statement released on Monday by the Jockey Club said. \u201cThe JCSA is aware that Jason Servis has been indicted in the US on charges relating to the administration of prohibited substances to horses under his care and control.\u201d</p> <p>The February race day was billed in Riyadh as another event in a roll-call of sports that have been lured to the Kingdom by senior officials as part of a reform program that aims in part to make Saudi Arabia more outward-looking.</p> <p>Critics contend that sport is being used as a form of soft power, primarily to generate revenues, which could subsidise the vast but dwindling and increasingly unreliable sums the country generates from oil.

But the prime minister\u2019s spokesman refused to accept that the government was behind schedule. He said that there were now 23 drive-through sites where people could be tested. \u201cNew capacity is coming on-stream all the time,\u201d he said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The cabinet may not be involved in the decision on extending the lockdown, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman revealed.</strong> Although it normally meets on a Tuesday, no meeting has been scheduled for tomorrow. With Boris Johnson recovering at Chequers after his spell in intensive care, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, is deputising in his absence. <strong>The government has to take a decision about extending the lockdown by Thursday, which is when the regulations covering England need to be reviewed.</strong> The spokesman did not say exactly how or when this would be taken, but he said the main work coordinating the government\u2019s response to coronavirus was being taken by the morning No 10 meeting, which is chaired by Raab, and by the four coronavirus ministerial groups. The spokesman said that any decision to extend the lockdown would have to be reviewed again after three weeks. It is thought inevitable that the lockdown will be extended, and the spokesman told journalists that when the decision is formally announced, the government would \u201cset out the reasoning behind the decision as soon as it is taken\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson is not doing any government work in Chequers, the spokesman said.</strong> He told journalists: \u201cThe prime minister is focusing on his recovery and he is not currently carrying out government work.\u201d And the PM is not receiving red boxes containing government papers at the moment, the spokesman said. The spokesman said he did not receive any while he was in hospital. A briefing early last week suggesting that he would be getting red boxes turned out to be wrong, the spokesman said, because the PM\u2019s condition deteriorated.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman denied claims that No 10 had given misleading accounts of how ill the prime minister was.</strong> It was put to the spokesman that the PM\u2019s own account yesterday of how he might have died contrasted with reports that he was only admitted to hospital as a precaution and that he was \u201cin good spirits\u201d throughout his time there. The spokesman said all the information given to journalists \u201cwas provided by St Thomas\u2019 Hospital\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman defended the decision to test Michael Gove\u2019s daughter for coronavirus. </strong>After she developed coronavirus symptoms Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, said he would be self-isolating with her and the rest of his family at home, in line with government guidelines, but today it emerged that Gove is no longer self-isolating because his daughter tested negative. The spokesman said this was done on the advice of Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, because Gove is one of the figures leading the government\u2019s response to coronavirus. Asked why he could not work from home, the spokesman said Gove chairs one of the key ministerial groups dealing with coronavirus (the one covering the public sector as a whole) and it was \u201cbeneficial\u201d for him to be able to go into the office.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The spokesman said that the Department for Health and Social Care was committed to carrying out a full investigation into the death of every NHS worker from coronavirus.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-13T13:48:34.292Z\">at 2.48pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e945be38f081a236f192723\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-13T12:34:39.280Z\">1.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The prime minister\u2019s spokesperson described how ill Boris Johnson was during his stay in hospital:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As we set out, his condition did worsen over the course of last Monday afternoon and he had to be moved to the intensive care unit.</p> \n   <p>Now, clearly, if a person is moved to intensive care, that means that they are requiring a significant level of specialist treatment.</p> \n   <p>So, I think it was clear from the moment the prime minister was moved to intensive care that his condition had worsened.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-13T12:51:58.503Z\">at 1.51pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e94592d8f08db3109f21889\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/gregory-robinson\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-13T12:22:36.736Z\">1.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good afternoon.

class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The supply of clinical gowns in some NHS hospitals is \u201chand-to-mouth\u201d according to Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers in England, which represents hospital trusts. </p> \n  <p>He said there are some concerns about a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) in certain hospitals. </p> \n  <p>He told BBC Breakfast: \u201cThere is a range of personal protective equipment that needs to be delivered at the front line ... nearly all of that material is flowing in the way that trusts would like. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe bit where there\u2019s a particular problem was gowns, where we know that over the last 72 hours some trusts have run critically low on gowns. </p> \n  <p>\u201cNo trust, as far as I\u2019m aware, has actually run out but some of the stocks are very very low.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Hopson said the supply of gowns - imported from China - was \u201chand-to-mouth\u201d. </p> \n  <p>He said the NHS ordered \u201ca whole load of stock\u201d weeks ago, but delays have been caused by the product sometimes failing safety tests, while other batches have been mislabelled - meaning the NHS has ended up with additional masks. </p> \n  <p>He said: \u201cIf everything had been flowing exactly as had been ordered and if all of the material had properly passed its safety test, there would not be an issue. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThis is all really hand-to-mouth in terms of gown delivery, and we need to get to a more sustainable supply.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Hopson said those trusts with a surplus were being asked to share their supplies with neighbouring trusts, while alternative gowns were being sourced from elsewhere. </p> \n  <p>Emergency supplies had also been delivered to those most in demand, Hopson said.

Boris Johnson praised the NHS for saving his life as he was discharged from hospital. </p> \n  <p>A New Zealand nurse who was praised by the prime minister for her care has been \u201cblown away\u201d by the recognition, her brother said. </p> \n  <p>Boris Johnson used a video post on Sunday to mention by name the medics who had looked after him, particularly \u201ctwo nurses who stood by my bedside for 48 hours when things could have gone either way\u201d. </p> \n  <p>Johnson said the \u201cNHS has saved my life, no question\u201d after spending seven nights in St Thomas\u2019 in central London after contracting Covid-19 and was discharged at the weekend. </p> \n  <p>One of nurses mentioned by Johnson, Jenny from Invercargill on New Zealand\u2019s South Island, has been identified as Jenny McGee. </p> \n  <p>Her brother Rob told the New Zealand Herald the family had spoken with McGee just as she was \u201cabout to head off to do another night shift\u201d. </p> \n  <p>He told the paper: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are all very proud of Jen, not just in the support she gave Boris - but what she has been doing helping everyday people. </p> \n   <p>Whilst she is blown away by Boris\u2019s recognition, she is just really pleased to see the public recognition for the amazing work the NHS is doing - that made her really proud.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>McGee attended the Verdon College in Invercargill, and they said the community was \u201cso proud\u201d and that she had wanted to be a nurse since leaving in 2002. <br></p> \n  <p>The school said: \u201cJenny is described by her past teachers as an absolutely delightful person and someone who had a caring and humble nature. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThanks Jenny for your courage, outstanding work and the example you have provided for everyone at this difficult time. Your old school community is so proud of you!\u201d </p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, the mayor of the city, Sir Tim Shadbolt, told Stuff.co.nz: \u201cIt\u2019s not very often a nurse from Invercargill saves the life of the British prime minister.\u201d </p> \n  <p>The other nurse mentioned by Johnson - Luis, from near Porto in Portugal - has been named as Luis Pitarma and has been thanked by Portuguese president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. </p> \n  <p>A statement on the presidential website said: \u201cPresident Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa has already personally thanked the nurse Luis Pitarma, and ... also thanks the commitment of all Portuguese health professionals who in Portugal and around the world are providing decisive help in the fight to the pandemic.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The statement added that the president offered \u201cencouragement that is also addressed to professionals of other nationalities who, reinforcing the National Health Service, provide an invaluable service to Portugal\u201d. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-13T07:13:17.139Z\">at 8.13am BST</time></p> \n</div>",
  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Italy\u2019s death toll passes 20,000</h2> <p>The number of fatalities from coronavirus in Italy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-italy-new-york-death-tolls-slow-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9498a08f082dfd549d5a8e#block-5e9498a08f082dfd549d5a8e\">rose by 566 on Monday</a>, 135 more than on Sunday, bringing the total death toll to over 20,000. Almost half of the deaths (280) were registered in Lombardy, the northern region worst affected by the virus. The civil protection authority said the number of people who were currently infected had risen by 1,363 (1.3%) to 103,616, a further sign that the curve there is flattening.</p> <h2>Confirmed global death toll passes 116,000</h2> <p>At least 1.8 million people have been infected and 116,098 have died worldwide, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, who have been tracking official and media reports. The tallies are likely to be underestimates due to different testing regimes and suspected underreporting of figures.</p> <h2>UK hospital deaths top 11,000</h2> <p>A total of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-italy-new-york-death-tolls-slow-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e946cc48f08db3109f21958#block-5e946cc48f08db3109f21958\">11,329 patients have died</a> in UK hospitals after testing positive, the UK\u2019s Department of Health said, up by 717 from 10,612 in 24 hours.</p> <h2>Belgium records 303 new deaths</h2> <p>Belgian health authorities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-italy-new-york-death-tolls-slow-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e943efb8f082dfd549d56d7#block-5e943efb8f082dfd549d56d7\">reported 303 more deaths in 24 hours</a>, bringing the country\u2019s total death toll from the outbreak to 3,903. Its death toll is lower than those in other European countries and the US due to its smaller population, but proportionally, the outbreak is now more deadly than in Italy.</p> <h2>Singapore records biggest daily jump in infections</h2> <p>Health authorities in Singapore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-italy-new-york-death-tolls-slow-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9490218f081a236f19297b#block-5e9490218f081a236f19297b\">confirmed 386 more cases</a>, the city-state\u2019s biggest daily jump since the outbreak began there. That takes its total to 2,918 cases. A large number of the new cases are linked to outbreaks in migrant workers\u2019 dormitories.</p> <h2>German experts recommend easing of restrictions</h2> <p>As time runs out on emergency measures to limit the outbreak in Germany, the country\u2019s National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-italy-new-york-death-tolls-slow-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e947b688f081a236f192884#block-5e947b688f081a236f192884\">recommended a gradual relaxing of restrictions</a>, as long as new infections stabilise and personal hygiene measures are maintained.</p> <h2>WHO urges lockdown caution</h2> <p>The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-italy-new-york-death-tolls-slow-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9485b78f08db3109f21a59#block-5e9485b78f08db3109f21a59\">urged caution over moves to lift some lockdown conditions</a>. He said much was still unknown about the behaviour of the virus and emphasised that case finding, testing and isolating were still crucial to controlling the outbreak.</p> <h2>US nearing peak, expert says</h2> <p>Robert Redfield, director of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-italy-new-york-death-tolls-slow-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e94696a8f081a236f1927ba#block-5e94696a8f081a236f1927ba\">told NBC\u2019s Today programme</a>: \u201cWe are nearing the peak right now \u2026 You\u2019ll know when you\u2019re at the peak when the next day is actually less than the day before.

  "<p>Renters\u2019 unions are calling on the government to suspend rents for the duration of the coronavirus crisis, as research suggests millions are having to choose between paying landlords and putting food on the table, or have already been forced to leave their homes.</p> \n<p>Polling conducted last weekend, after rent payments came due for many renters for the first time since the coronavirus shutdown began to affect incomes across the country, showed many renters were either already in or on the brink of crisis, with one in six forced to seek extra financial help to stay afloat.</p> \n<p>About one in five UK households \u2013 4.5 million families \u2013 live in private rented accommodation, with a similar amount in social housing, according to the most recent figures.</p> \n<p>According to research carried out for the Guardian by Opinium, six in 10 renters said they had suffered financially as a result of the UK-wide shutdown that began three weeks ago. Of those, one in five had been forced to choose between food and bills or paying rent, and one in four said they had already had to voluntarily leave their home, move in with friends or parents, or request an earlier end to their tenancy because of the crisis.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fbb96cc0-be99-47f0-8544-bb0a39f4fbe1\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian is investigating how the UK government prepared for \u2013 and is responding to \u2013 the coronavirus pandemic.

Kat Wright, national organiser for Acorn, which campaigns for tenants\u2019 rights, said this stored up problems for the future.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re facing a huge surge in evictions once restrictions are lifted, and renters across the UK are already unable to pay their rent,\u201d she said. \u201cTenants need protection from evictions post-emergency and from rent debt accrued during the crisis.\u201d</p> \n<p>Despite the government\u2019s measures, and guidance to landlords asking them to \u201cbe compassionate\u201d, tenants who spoke to the Guardian said they had already faced threats of punitive action from their landlords. One self-employed renter, who preferred to remain unnamed, told the Guardian that when he approached his landlord to ask for a deferment of rent, he was served with an eviction notice in reply.</p> \n<p>Others who have lost income are being forced into taking whatever work they can in order to continue to pay their rents, often in front line jobs in the gig economy, such as driving taxis or delivering takeaway food, potentially exposing themselves to infection with coronavirus.</p> \n<p>\u201cMany renters feel they have no choice but to break social distancing guidelines and go out to work, just so their landlords can continue to profit,\u201d said Amina Gichinga of the London Renters Union. \u201cHow are people supposed to pay rent with no income and at least a month\u2019s wait for any government assistance? How are people in low-paid jobs meant to clear hundreds or thousands of pounds of rent arrears in the future?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cDuring this global pandemic, people should be able to prioritise their safety and paying for food and other essentials. All rent payments need to be suspended and rent arrears need to be waived urgently to keep renters safe from eviction and from debt, and to prevent the further spread of the virus.\u201d</p> \n<p>An online petition calling for rents to be suspended has already reached 100,000 signatures, and the LRU wrote to Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, at the end of March calling him to act on its demands. Opinium\u2019s polling found overwhelming support for a rent suspension, with three in four renters \u2013 and even a slight majority of landlords \u2013 in support. </p> \n<p>A spokesman for Jenrick\u2019s department, the ministry of housing, communities and local government, said: \u201cWe understand that the Covid-19 outbreak has left many facing uncertainty and feeling worried. Emergency legislation and the suspension of housing possession action means that no tenant in either a social or private rented home will be forced out.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Covid-19 symptoms vary widely, and undertesting in many countries means that many people may have already had the coronavirus without having received a positive diagnosis. Is it possible to find out, and how should you behave if you think you may have been infected? </p> \n<h2><strong>Is there any way to know whether someone has had Covid-19 in the past?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Dr</strong><strong> William Hillmann: </strong>Antibody tests are being developed but are not in widespread clinical use yet. The antibody testing would allow us to check blood samples for antibodies against coronavirus to tell whether somebody has had it. I, and I think many others, are anxiously awaiting for those to become available.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"28f9c4c8-d8b6-4f17-bdd6-1264330215a7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/akiXEfWW-V0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Could I have had it and been asymptomatic? </strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Hillmann</strong>: Coronavirus is actually quite a significant spectrum of symptoms, from people who are entirely asymptomatic and would have no idea that they have it to people with very mild, cold-like symptoms \u2013 runny nose, congestion, sore throat \u2013 to people with more flu-like symptoms \u2013 high fevers, muscle aches, shortness of breath and cough. Loss of smell and taste are also symptoms. All the way up to people with severe illness, who we\u2019re seeing in the hospital with respiratory failure, requiring ICU care.<strong> </strong></p> \n<p>It\u2019s impossible right now to say what the true prevalence of the disease in the US is since we are still prioritizing testing for people who are sick or in the hospital or who are healthcare workers. We\u2019re not doing widespread testing that South Korea and some European countries have done to get a sense of how many people are asymptomatic or have such minimal symptoms that they attribute it to allergies or something else.</p> \n<h2><strong>Are people who are asymptomatic also contagious? </strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Hillmann: </strong>A significant proportion of people who are totally asymptomatic are contagious for some portion of time. We just don\u2019t know [for how long] at this point, because we don\u2019t have the kind of testing available to screen for asymptomatic infections.</p> \n<p>When people are symptomatic, they\u2019re contagious. A day or two before they become symptomatic, they\u2019re likely contagious as well. A virus builds up and starts to shed, and then after symptoms resolve, people can still be contagious for a couple of days. We have some evidence of viral shed even a couple of weeks after symptoms are resolved. It\u2019s hard to know if that\u2019s actual live virus, which is still able to infect somebody, or if that\u2019s just dead virus that the body is shedding.</p> \n<h2><strong>Should someone behave differently if they think, but don\u2019t know for certain, that they have already had it?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Dr David Buchholz:</strong> We all have to be role models. If we\u2019re all in it together, we all should be doing social distancing.</p> \n<p><strong>Hillmann: </strong>Since there\u2019s no real way to know at this point who might have had it, unless you\u2019re symptomatic, you get a swab and are definitively diagnosed with it, I would just act as if you hadn\u2019t had it. Keep doing all of those things that we all should be doing at this point: social distancing and hand hygiene. I think universal mask-wearing in public is a reasonable recommendation based on what we know about the wide spectrum of symptoms, and the fact that people can be asymptomatic and still be shedding the virus.</p> \n<h2><strong>If I think I may have had it, do I have an ethical obligation to tell people I came in contact with? Even if it may in fact just have been a cold?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Buchholz: </strong>I would, absolutely. I\u2019m in New York, and it was definitely in the community before we knew it. So, yeah, any family members and close friends, maybe somebody you work next to, I think I would just alert them, especially if it was in the last 14 days. If it\u2019s been more than 14 days, they would have gotten sick by now if they had significant exposure.</p> \n<p><strong>Hillmann: </strong>It\u2019s up to every individual about what they feel is right. That being said, with the surge in infections that we\u2019re seeing in places like New York, if you were symptomatic at one point but were not tested, and you were in close contact with somebody, I think you should tell them.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bbdedea8-3745-42f9-a4fe-eb53a8598b4f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1zHDqywPrnc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>If I\u2019ve had it, can I get it again?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Buchholz: </strong>There\u2019s not been any evidence that anyone\u2019s gotten it more than once.

  "<p>I have lost something. I am in my house, and it has suddenly become huge. Every room opens on to another room into a chamber of unfamiliar spaces. I have misplaced my daughter and her baby. They are here somewhere, but I can\u2019t find them as I wander around forgetting what I am looking for.</p> <p>Upon waking, I note this Covid anxiety dream and text my children. The dream logic stays with me all day. Indeed I have misplaced them. We cannot be together. This is how life is now for most people. We comply to lockdown as rational beings, but the subconscious rebels. This is not all right.</p> <p>To be OK is to not have the virus \u2013 to complain about anything else feels self-indulgent, but this is a struggle. It is a struggle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-inequality-managers-zoom-cleaners-offices\">shot through with every pre-existing inequality</a>: the co-morbidities exacerbated by austerity; poor-quality high-density housing; basically a caste system whereby migrants work our land and clean up our various messes for less than the minimum wage. We did not need a pandemic to know this, did we? Anyone who has been near a hospital in the past 10 years will have seen how stretched it all is, as well as having witnessed immensely dedicated medical staff.</p> <p>There are political scores to be settled, always. The government\u2019s daily press briefings demonstrate the abject failure of lobby journalism. The wrong questions elicit not even answers, just mantras. The Berkeley professor Alexei Yurchak coined the term \u201chypernormalisation\u201d to describe the dying years of the Soviet system. Modern society was too complex and failing, so politicians created narratives that suggested the world was still simple and functional \u2013 they pretended that everything was normal \u2013 to hang on to power.</p> <p>So here we are pretending that this is a war to be waged and our resolve will beat this thing. The computation of loss cannot be measured on a graph. We attempt these computations daily. And fail. How do you imagine 10,000 deaths and how do you imagine more to come? How does one grieve this many people? How are we to suspend our lives waiting for more death, which we are told is inevitable?</p> <p>What is there to feel beyond powerlessness?</p> <p>As CS Lewis said, grief feels a lot like fear. For everyone who is cheerily spring cleaning their house, there are those of us who are paralysed, lethargic, unable to concentrate. As I have said before, the last thing we need in lockdown is more policing of emotion; we just need to get by.</p> <p>The atomised populace may well be angry at the ill-preparedness of our Tory leaders, but it is quite hard to know what to do with this anger day to day. The nearest experience of such mass loss for me was in the 80s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-aids-epidemic-san-francisco\">when Aids </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-aids-epidemic-san-francisco\">devastated an entire generation</a>. Then, I knew what to do. We organised, angry and defiant. We could still sit alongside the dying and their suffering.</p> <p>Now human touch is gone and student nurses are being taught how to help ease the distress of someone who cannot see their faces and who is drowning. Those who are shielded can also never be touched. As we stay in with our box sets and competitive crafting, I wonder a lot about the anticipation of grief.</p> <p>One grieves when someone is dying and yet when they do die, it\u2019s a shock, and the grieving begins again. The knowledge of what is going to happen doesn\u2019t lessen the intensity of what happens. Anticipatory grief is something that shrinks argue about. No one knows if it lessens the experience of grief, post-death.</p> <p>In this time of huge loss we might recognise what is happening. It is a trauma. \u201cTraumatic events are extraordinary not because they occur rarely, but rather because they overwhelm the ordinary adaptations to life,\u201d wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/03/susie-orbach-books-to-understand-yourself\">Judith Herman in her great book Trauma and Recovery</a>.</p> <p>This pandemic is a global trauma. It has happened and and it will continue. This is the emotional truth of it. The tutting at the investment people have in the death of celebrities or Boris Johnson\u2019s recovery seem to me very unforgiving. We cling to these narratives in order to negotiate mortality and vulnerability. There are other narratives available that are more finessed and caveated, though they all come with lectures that support whatever political positions someone had pre-virus.</p> <p>As politicians scrabble around, desperate to appear in control, it is clear they are not. All this is acted out in this limbo of expected loss. Peaks on a graph mean the loss comes nearer. The man who has mended my shoes for 20 years and his father have died. Someone who was always there no longer is.</p> <p>This is real. \u201cFlattening the curve\u201d does not talk of our lost connections. We are dislocated. Dissociation, numbness, agitation, exhaustion, blunted affect. I cycle through these feelings. I recognise them: the reactions to trauma. They are what they are.</p> <p>The official discourses of certainty and invulnerability have never looked more of a charade. We cannot mourn what we cannot acknowledge. We grieve for those who have gone as well as those who will go. The accommodation of loss on such a scale feels impossible to live with. But we are all living with it. Somehow.</p>",

  "<p>Tim Brooke-Taylor, who has died aged 79 of coronavirus, was one of those Oxbridge graduates who brought surreal, anarchic humour first to the stage, then television, where he was one of the trio adding slapstick to the mix in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2007/mar/01/comedy.television\">The Goodies</a>.</p> <p>Typical of the humour of The Goodies was a medieval vasectomy sketch with Brooke-Taylor standing in a park, back to the camera and trousers around his ankles, while a knight on a charger rushes him with a lance aimed at the appropriate area. He once reflected: \u201cThere are moments when I\u2019m standing in the middle of some high street dressed as a rabbit and I say to myself, \u2018I\u2019ve not only got a degree, but I\u2019m an honorary doctor of laws. <em>Doctor</em> Tim Brooke-Taylor. What am I doing hopping down this high street in floppy ears and a furry tail?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>With his fellow Cambridge graduates Graeme Garden and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/bill-oddie\">Bill Oddie</a>, Brooke-Taylor created The Goodies, which ran on the BBC for 10 years from 1970 to 1980. All three wrote the scripts at the start, while in later years they were provided by Garden and Oddie. ITV revived the show with a 1981 Christmas special and a six-part series the following year. Cartoon-style humour came from the three contrasting characters portrayed on screen \u2013 the pompous Brooke-Taylor, the professorial Garden and the untidy but raffish Oddie.</p> <p>The programme was most striking for its sight gags \u2013 such as Brooke-Taylor, dressed as an Edwardian nanny, falling into a river \u2013 with significant location filming and special effects. \u201cOur pre-production meetings with the art designers and production designers were almost more important than the writing of the scripts,\u201d he revealed.</p> <p>A cat toppling over the Post Office Tower in London was the centrepiece of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb59dEHRt5Q\">Kitten Kong</a> episode, which won the Silver Rose at the 1972 Montreux television festival. Three years later, the same award went to a Goodies show paying homage to the silent film greats that included Brooke-Taylor grappling with a lion.</p> <p>Nevertheless, radio was the medium where Brooke-Taylor made his most enduring contribution to comedy. He was a panellist and occasional writer throughout all nine series of BBC Radio\u2019s anarchic, revue-style sketch show <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b009zbr2/episodes/guide\">I\u2019m Sorry I\u2019ll Read That Again</a> (1964-73), a cocktail of silly voices, awful puns and smutty humour. Alongside Garden and Oddie, as well as others including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/john-cleese\">John Cleese</a>, Jo Kendall and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jun/16/broadcasting.guardianobituaries\">David Hatch</a>, Brooke-Taylor was most memorable as the screeching Lady Constance de Coverlet, an ageing dowager reputed for her size, variously heard in the guise of Anne of Cleavage or an elephant in a parody of the TV adventure <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z438rv_BMGc\">Daktari</a>.</p> <p>The show was spun off into the even longer-running <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qnwb\">I\u2019m Sorry I Haven\u2019t a Clue</a>, a parody of panel games, with those taking part given \u201csilly things to do\u201d and Brooke-Taylor ever-present from its launch in 1972 until his death. It became one of BBC Radio 4\u2019s most popular programmes and the original presenter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/apr/25/radio.bbc\">Humphrey Lyttelton</a>, described him as \u201cprone to argue with the chairman, slightly vulnerable, perspires a lot, a favourite with the crowd\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e2fd1dcbe15a5db70806ff0d75d0c9d4940a8e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e2fd1dcbe15a5db70806ff0d75d0c9d4940a8e6/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Brooke-Taylor with fellow panellist Victoria Wood for a 2009 recording of BBC Radio 4\u2019s I\u2019m Sorry I Haven\u2019t a Clue.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Brooke-Taylor with fellow panellist Victoria Wood for a 2009 recording of BBC Radio 4\u2019s I\u2019m Sorry I Haven\u2019t a Clue.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tim was born in Buxton, Derbyshire, to Rachel (nee Pawson), a former games teacher at Cheltenham Ladies\u2019 college who played lacrosse at international level, and Edward Brooke-Taylor, a solicitor and veteran of the first world war, who won the Military Cross for gallantry and was then a home guard commander during the second world war.</p> <p>Following the death of his father when he was 12, Tim attended Winchester college, then spent a year teaching at schools in Hertfordshire and Derbyshire before gaining a law degree from Pembroke College, Cambridge. He joined the university\u2019s Footlights drama club in 1960, performing alongside his fellow students Oddie, Cleese and Graham Chapman. He was Footlights president when A Clump of Plinths, its 1963 revue for the Edinburgh festival, transferred to the West End, retitled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jul/11/cambridge-circus-footlights-review-john-cleese-bill-oddie\">Cambridge Circus</a>, then in 1964 to Broadway.</p> <p>Just as Alan Bennett, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/nov/27/sir-jonathan-miller-obituary\">Jonathan Miller</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/mar/28/guardianobituaries.media\">Dudley Moore</a> found a path into television satire following the success of their revue Beyond the Fringe, an Oxford-Cambridge collaboration, Brooke-Taylor headed for BBC radio, joining I\u2019m Sorry I\u2019ll Read That Again.</p> <p>No BBC television opportunities were immediately presented to him, so in 1965 he joined ITV\u2019s topical consumer affairs show On the Braden Beat, parodying a rightwing business executive in satirical sketches. He then joined the scriptwriting team \u2013 along with Oddie and most of the future <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/04/monty-python-at-50-a-half-century-of-silly-walks-edible-props-and-dead-parrots\">Monty Python</a> members \u2013 on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/sep/01/sir-david-frost\">David Frost</a>\u2019s BBC satirical show The Frost Report (1966-67), then was both a writer and performer in two comedy series starring Marty Feldman \u2013 At Last the 1948 Show (1967) and Marty (1968-69).</p> <p>Broaden Your Mind (1968-69) was a sketch show that proved to be the precursor to The Goodies. Brooke-Taylor and Garden created it, and were joined in the second series by Oddie. Brooke-Taylor, John Junkin and Barry Cryer also wrote and starred in the BBC Radio 2 sketch show Hello Cheeky (1973-79), but their 1976 TV version was less successful.</p> <p>Sitcoms extended Brooke-Taylor\u2019s career beyond such programmes. After taking a supporting role as the neighbour Toby Burgess in His and Hers (1970-72), he teamed up with Junkin to script and star as two flatmates on the look out for women in the 1971 pilot The Rough With the Smooth, followed by a 1975 series.</p> <p>In Me and My Girl (1984-88), he played Derek Yates, supporting his widowed best friend and ad agency partner Simon Harrap (Richard O\u2019Sullivan) in bringing up a teenage daughter. He then starred in You Must Be the Husband (1987-88) as Tom Hammond, coming to terms with the success his wife, Alice (Diane Keen), finds in writing a racy romantic novel.</p> <p>Bolstered by Oddie\u2019s musical skills, the Goodies had a string of chart singles, including the Top 10 hits <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzum25lHoqE\">The Inbetweenies</a>/Father Christmas Do Not Touch Me (1974) and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfecoM1kpo\">The Funky Gibbon</a>/Sick Man Blues (1975), both double A-sides. They also voiced the superhero cartoon TV series Bananaman (1983-88).</p> <p>Brooke-Taylor was appointed OBE in 2011.

Corona Zombies is, in effect, the What\u2019s Up, Tiger Lily? of the lockdown age.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JptqwQNg480\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JptqwQNg480?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It has a shaky start. Cameron, playing an airhead named Barbie, trots out all the familiar jokes that you\u2019re already sick of \u2013 \u201cCoronavirus? Why is everyone drinking beer?\u201d \u201cWuhan? But I like that rap group\u201d \u2013 before things get up and running. And in that sense, Corona Zombies is the model of efficient exposition. Barbie watches the news. The anchor describes the symptoms of the virus, and then immediately cuts away to breaking news about how the virus has definitely turned waves of people into zombies. And then we\u2019re off to the races.</p> <p>We visit ground zero of the virus; a Chinese bat soup factory which is already under full attack from the zombies. A zombie taskforce is put together to murder the zombies. They stop off along the way to catch a toilet roll hoarder. There are many, many cracks about maintaining a six-foot distance. \u201cThis is for not washing your hands!\u201d a character screams as he offloads the contents of a machine gun into a swarm of zombies. During one of the most exploitative scenes, where a young woman\u2019s naked breasts are splattered with blood from a nearby zombie disembowelment, a news reporter gravely implies that none of this would have happened if everyone had observed social distancing. It\u2019s a bit like watching a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 episode, which is no bad thing.</p> <p>If this was any other time, I\u2019d advise skipping Corona Zombies. It\u2019s fun for 20 minutes, but then burns out as the central gimmick wears on. Only a certain amount of coronavirus jokes exist at this point, and Corona Zombies tells them all repeatedly. It\u2019s the sort of thing you\u2019d watch drunk in your house at midnight. But then again, that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to watch all films for the foreseeable future, so it has to be worth a go.</p> <p>In the future, everyone will make a coronavirus movie. And, for the most part these will be sad and serious and boring, and will largely exist so that Mark Ruffalo \u2013 who will play a senator whistleblowing governmental negligence in every single one of them \u2013 can emote sufficiently for awards season to notice. Meanwhile, now that we\u2019re in the thick of it, the heavy genre of Corona Zombies seems like the only acceptable place to meet this thing. It\u2019s a perfect reaction piece. Schlocky, tongue-in-cheek, over the top. It exists to undermine the thing that we\u2019re all scared of. Its intention cannot be faulted.</p>",

Do not read unless you have watched season three, episode five.</em></p> <p>Let\u2019s take a moment to reflect on the passing of Liam Dempsey. OK, that\u2019ll do.</p> <p>The heir to the money man behind Incite bleeds out on a Californian beach after being shot by Caleb\u2019s pal, Ash. She did it to prove her own agency, her free will \u2026 and also just to shut the dude up. He couldn\u2019t help whinging about how all the human scum deserved to have their futures written by the Rohohoboam and how he\u2019d had all his money taken and blah blah blah so, anyway \u2026 he gets a bullet in the stomach and falls into the sea. Eventually he dies in Caleb\u2019s arms, his last words enigmatic and just a little bit mean: \u201c<em>You</em> did it! <em>You </em>did it!\u201d.<br><br>Liam became expendable because Dolores now has all the information from Incite that she needs. Namely the Rohoho file on Serac which predicts the future of the billionaire tech mogul, \u00e9migr\u00e9 Frenchman and wannabe God.</p> <p>Dolores is of the mind that predicting people\u2019s future with a degree of accuracy that allows someone to control their lives, to keep them on a loop as Bernard puts it, is not fair. She is not for determinism, and having lived umpteen lives as a host in Westworld where not only are events preordained but unremittingly brutal, you can understand why.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36b5e0d80f1c7279d751de5b4ef76d9a2db256c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36b5e0d80f1c7279d751de5b4ef76d9a2db256c9/0_31_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Big data ... the mysterious Engerraund Serac, played by Vincent Cassel is the target of Dolores\u2019s theft.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Big data ... the mysterious Engerraund Serac, played by Vincent Cassel is the target of Dolores\u2019s theft.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the other hand, you do get the sense that were Dolores to exist in our current reality, she might have some struggles remaining GDPR compliant. In jacking Serac\u2019s data, she also steals the files of an unspecified number of other human beings. And during a leisurely wander through futuristic LA on plane, train and automobile, she decides that the best thing to do with all this data would be to send it directly to people\u2019s phones, causing them to learn they will have early onset dementia on the subway home.</p> <p>It does appear, by the looks of the mass freak out, that everybody gets bad news. There\u2019s nobody looking at their phone, skipping to the conclusion and finding \u201clives to 95 and enjoys a lovely garden\u201d. It\u2019s all either cancer or suicide. You can see why Liam got so moody. There is something to be said that Westworld\u2019s abiding philosophy is misanthropy and that it would be a better show were that not the case. That said, you don\u2019t create panic on the streets of Los Angeles by sharing good news.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Caleb is enduring the most am-dram acid trip in history. Stabbed by Liam with the \u201cdigital psychopharma\u201d the Dempsey was too sulky to take at last week\u2019s orgy, Caleb is plunged into a five act experience called \u201cGenre\u201d. Basically, it means that his experiences are given the stylings of a different type of cinema, from noir to romance and war movie. As ideas go, it\u2019s interesting. As special effect sequences go it\u2019s highly underwhelming, as all that changes is soundtrack and the image filter. I don\u2019t know, perhaps the psychedelics in 1990s Norfolk were particularly powerful and I\u2019m biased, but if I were Caleb I\u2019d be asking for a refund. Maybe that\u2019s what he was doing when cradling Liam on the beach.</p> <p>At least the Genre experience gives Aaron Paul a chance to use the gurning, eye rolling shtick that we used to see in Breaking Bad and he also gets to be, like, totally blown away by the chance to fire a gun with the world\u2019s biggest bullet in it. Due to his incapacitation, Caleb shoots his massive gun all wrong, but fortunately the bullet has its own internal piloting system and pulls a 180 in the air before crashing itself into a car full of Serac\u2019s goons.</p> <p>Given that we also see Malcolm Tucker/Martin detonate himself and blow up the top floors of Serac\u2019s HQ, where does our plutocratic bad guy stand at the end of episode five? Well, he certainly looks disconsolate as he sits on his glass-walled private jet traversing the globe. But given that we now know, through the telling of his backstory, that Serac has learned how to edit humans, and that he has some of the world\u2019s most idiosyncratic individuals (including his own brother) stashed out in the desert, it would appear he\u2019s not over yet. Oh, I almost forgot, he has all the money in the world, too. So as Dolores and Caleb board their own plane \u2013 destination unknown \u2013 it would appear that the real battle is yet to be joined.</p> <h2>Divergence and anomalies</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6fa340d2116a78ebbb1f01bb917a6f94eba17de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6fa340d2116a78ebbb1f01bb917a6f94eba17de/0_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Can anyone explain what\u2019s happening with this T-shirt, please?!\u2019 ...

  "<p>For the entirety of Ronald Reagan\u2019s first term, despite overwhelming evidence that Aids was a public health crisis, he brushed off the disease\u2019s severity, saying \u201cit would go away\u201d. By 1987, Aids had killed more than 29,000 Americans. In that same year, Don Francis, an official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, testified before Congress that Reagan\u2019s administration caused \u201cuntold hardship, misery and expense to the American public\u201d by obstructing, resisting and interfering with policies and programmes designed to prevent the Aids epidemic in the US.</p> <p>Certain factors at play <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/1980s-aids-pandemic-coronavirus-gay-community-survive\">in the A</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/1980s-aids-pandemic-coronavirus-gay-community-survive\">ids epidemic</a> are not at play in our current pandemic: most obviously, Covid-19 is not associated with the gay community. Nonetheless, there are echoes of Reagan\u2019s response to the Aids epidemic. Last month, days after California had declared a state of emergency and Seattle schools had begun to close, Donald Trump asserted that Covid-19 would simply \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-misleading-claims\">go away</a>\u201d. Shortly before that, he said that it would \u201c<a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/watch/trump-coronavirus-will-disappear-one-day-like-a-miracle-79636549723\">disappear \u2026 like a miracle</a>\u201d. Trump was joined in his parade of denial by other far-right populist leaders, especially Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro. In March, he described Covid-19 as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/brazils-jair-bolsonaro-says-coronavirus-crisis-is-a-media-trick\">little flu</a>\u201d that does not warrant \u201chysteria\u201d, and claimed that Brazil would be protected from the virus by its climate and youthful population.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We need leaders who allow public health experts, rather than their political self-interest, to guide policy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What motivates men like Trump and Bolsonaro to deny, falsify and dismiss evidence about public health crises?</p> <p>One salient feature stands out as common among these men: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/us/toxic-masculinity.html\">toxic masculinity</a>. The concept has become popular, with Google searches for the term <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=toxic%20masculinity\">skyrocketing</a> in January 2019 when the shaving company Gillette <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/01/15/gillette-takes-toxic-masculinity-new-ad-rebranding-metoo-era-inviting-backlash/\">released</a> a series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/15/gillette-metoo-ad-on-toxic-masculinity-cuts-deep-with-mens-rights-activists\">advertisements</a> that challenged traditional expressions of masculinity, such as bullying, suppressing emotions and sexual harassment. Those advertisements set off a public debate about whether toxic masculinity is a helpful concept. Some took to Twitter and other media to complain that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/masculinity-isnt-a-sickness-11547682809\">masculinity isn\u2019t a sickness</a>\u201d, while others, like the <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/2019/01/ce-corner\">American Psychological Association</a>, maintained that these traditional forms of masculinity harm not only men, but also those around them.</p> <p>The current pandemic throws into stark relief how useful the concept of toxic masculinity can be. Dr Roger Kirby, a men\u2019s health expert, <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/tre.709\">observes</a> that toxic forms of masculinity, which lead to \u201cdominant, aggressive, [and] risk-taking\u201d behaviour, cause men to see illness or other health problems as effeminate and weak, leading them to choose risk and discomfort over the \u201cemasculation\u201d of seeking medical treatment. As a result, men who pursue these forms of masculinity <a href=\"https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1016/j.jomh.2010.09.227\">display</a> \u201cthe strongest predictors of individual risk behaviour over the life course\u201d.</p> <p>Trump and Bolsonaro are clear examples of men who cling to toxic forms of masculinity. They lash out at anything that threatens their dominance, and rely on misogyny and violence to bolster their egos. They denigrate women and femininity in order to reinforce their fragile sense of their manhood, referring to women as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/16/brazil-lawmaker-rape-taunt\">slut[s]</a>\u201d, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/14/us/politics/trump-omarosa-dog.html\">dog[s]</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/655770/61-things-donald-trump-said-about-women\">piece[s] of ass</a>\u201d. Trump has boasted about his<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/03/03/politics/donald-trump-small-hands-marco-rubio/index.html\"> penis size</a> and<a href=\"https://deadline.com/2016/09/donald-trump-testosterone-level-applause-dr-oz-show-1201820359/\"> testosterone levels</a>, and Bolsonaro said that he would rather have a dead son than a gay one. Both frequently encourage or excuse violence, and rage at those who disagree or make fun of them. They are two peas in a pod. And in our current crisis, their toxic masculinity is a deathly threat. It plays out in the most literal sense: it risks physical harm to others and themselves.</p> <p>True to this prediction, Trump recently made headlines for initially refusing to take a test for Covid-19, obey physical distancing guidelines or wear a face mask, undermining his own health experts\u2019 recommendations. Bolsonaro, following suit, declared that his manly history \u201cas an athlete\u201d would protect him from the virus. And while it is tempting to laugh at the absurdity of Bolsonaro\u2019s claim, the sobering reality is that Trump and Bolsonaro\u2019s behaviour has an ever-rising body count.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/04/trump-coronavirus-science-analysis\">How science finally caught up with Trump's playbook \u2013 with millions of lives at stake</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now that this lie is no longer sustainable, Trump and Bolsonaro have pivoted.

We need leaders who allow public health experts, rather than their political self-interest, to guide policy. We find ourselves in a time that calls for traditionally \u201cfeminine\u201d traits, such as empathy, solidarity and compassion.

  "<p>The men who beat Mehboob Ali did so without mercy. Dragging him to a field in the village of Harewali, on the fringes of north-west Delhi, the group hit him with sticks and shoes until he bled from his nose and ears. Ali was a Muslim, recently returned home from a religious gathering, and the Hindu mob was quite certain he was part of a so-called Islamic conspiracy to spread coronavirus to Hindus nationwide. His attackers believed the devout 22-year-old must be punished before he carried out \u201ccorona jihad\u201d.</p> <p>The allegations were entirely false, but according to video footage and his family, the men who beat Ali on 5 April were in little doubt of his guilt, demanding: \u201cTell us who else is behind this conspiracy.\u201d Ali was then taken to a nearby Hindu temple and told to renounce Islam and convert to Hinduism before they would allow him to go to hospital. </p> <p>Five days after the attack Ali\u2019s family was still in fear of also being accused of spreading the virus. \u201cIf we file a police case, the Hindus will not let us live in the village,\u201d said one family member, who asked not to be named. Police confirmed that due to his attendance at a Muslim convention in Bhopal a few weeks back, Ali was being held in the isolation ward of Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan hospital in Delhi as a \u201ccorona suspect\u201d, though he had no symptoms.</p> <p>The attack on Ali is symptomatic of the growing demonisation of India\u2019s Muslim community, who are being accused, without any basis, of conducting a malevolent campaign to spread Covid-19 to the Hindu majority.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/india-delhi-after-hindu-mob-riot-religious-hatred-nationalists\">Inside Delhi: beaten, lynched and burnt alive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Already a minority under attack \u2013 it is just weeks since Hindu mobs attacked Muslims <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/india-delhi-after-hindu-mob-riot-religious-hatred-nationalists\">in religious riots in Delhi</a> \u2013 Muslims have now seen their businesses across India boycotted, volunteers distributing rations called \u201ccoronavirus terrorists\u201d, and others accused of spitting in food and infecting water supplies with the virus. Posters have appeared barring Muslims from entering certain neighbourhoods in states as far apart as Delhi, Karnataka, Telangana and Madhya Pradesh.</p> <p>The troubles began when the gathering of an Islamic missionary organisation, Tablighi Jamaat, held in mid-March in the south Delhi neighbourhood of Nizamuddin, was singled out by police and government as being responsible for the spread of coronavirus across India. The convention, which had been given the go-ahead by the Delhi authorities, was attended by about 8,000 people, including hundreds of foreigners. It soon became apparent that many at the convention had unknowingly picked up Covid-19 and brought it back to towns and villages across India.</p> <p>Across the country, police were ordered to round up anyone associated with the organisation. So far, more than 27,000 Tablighi Jamaat members and their contacts have been quarantined in about 15 states. In Uttar Pradesh, the police offered up to 10,000 rupees (\u00a3105) for information on anyone who had attended the gathering.</p> <p>In a statement this week, the Indian Scientists\u2019 Response to Covid-19 group said \u201cthe available data does not support the speculation\u201d that the blame for the coronavirus epidemic in India lies mainly with Tablighi Jamaat.

  "<p>The response to Covid-19 has in many ways played out to our expectations.

Regressive policies and enforcement procedures are being scaled back in surprising numbers. While sectors under federal control \u2013 immigration policy, higher education, healthcare, election reform \u2013 have had few Covid-related changes, those controlled by city and state governments \u2013 criminal justice, housing, transportation, utilities \u2013 have had many.</p> <p>These changes were put in place to slow viral transmission and stabilize the economy, not to benefit social welfare. But what\u2019s interesting is how much overlap there is between them. Sector by sector, the pandemic has unintentionally sparked changes pushed by reformers for decades. What couldn\u2019t be done in years has now happened in a matter of weeks. Policy changes that before Covid were dismissed as unreasonable are now seen not only as reasonable but as necessary.</p> <p>It shows us how <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/03/coronavirus-tsa-liquid-purell-paid-leave-rules.html\">absurd so many of our rules</a> were to begin with. But does it also show us how easy they\u2019ve been to change all along?</p> <p>Many of these changes still don\u2019t go far enough, come with caveats and fine print, are subject to absurd means-testing, or are only temporary. For those of us who believe that America needs serious change \u2013 and that this is the time to do it \u2013 what will it take to make many of these temporary changes permanent? These aren\u2019t necessarily the changes we want, but they give us a glimpse of what\u2019s possible.</p> <p>We are collecting more of these examples at <a href=\"https://pandemicpolicy.us/\">pandemicpolicy.us</a>.

That means that evictions are still on the horizon, only delayed.</p> <h2><strong>Free shelter</strong></h2> <p>For people without housing, there\u2019s been a movement to provide shelter, albeit temporary, in vacant or currently empty spaces, such as <a href=\"https://www.theday.com/article/20200331/NWS01/200339914\">nursing homes</a> in Connecticut and <a href=\"https://www.city-journal.org/san-francisco-plan-to-shelter-homeless-in-luxury-hotels\">hotels</a> in San Francisco.

But they are no less essential even under \u201cnormal\u201d circumstances. So why is access limited then?</p> <h2><strong>Reducing arrests and prosecutions</strong></h2> <p>With the goal of increasing social distancing and slowing the spread of Covid in overpopulated prisons, the pandemic has inadvertently sparked changes that criminal justice reformers have been pushing for years.</p> <p>Police departments in cities such as<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/u-s-police-shift-priorities-as-novel-coronavirus-crisis-grows\"> Fort Worth</a>,<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/salvadorhernandez/los-angeles-coronavirus-inmates-early-release\"> Los Angeles</a>,<a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2020/03/16/colorado-coronavirus-jails-arrests/\"> Denver</a> and<a href=\"https://communityimpact.com/nashville/southwest-nashville/public-safety/2020/03/20/metro-nashville-police-encouraged-to-issue-citations-in-lieu-of-physical-arrests-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/\"> Nashville</a> have reduced arrests, whether by opting not to go after low-level misdemeanors, issuing civil summons in lieu of arrests, or choosing to<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/us/coronavirus-police.html\"> warn people rather than arrest them</a>.</p> <p>To reduce \u201c<a href=\"https://www.prisonpolicy.org/virus/virusresponse.html\">jail churn</a>\u201d \u2013 the large numbers of people going in and out of local jails \u2013 many district attorney offices have decided <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/487987-brooklyn-da-says-his-office-wont-prosecute-some-low-level-offenses-amid\">not to prosecute low-level offenses</a> that are <a href=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/coronavirus/bs-md-ci-cr-mosby-prisoner-release-20200318-u7knneb6o5gqvnqmtpejftavia-story.html\">not considered a threat</a> to public safety.

To reduce contact, programs like <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/adjusting-interview-requirements-covid-19-blanket-waiver\">Snap</a> and <a href=\"https://krcgtv.com/news/local/wic-program-removes-in-person-requirement-and-allows-food-substitutes\">WIC</a> no longer require in-person interviews. In Utah, <a href=\"https://www.modernhealthcare.com/medicaid/utah-suspends-medicaid-work-requirement-due-covid-19\">work requirements for Medicaid have been suspended</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Free food and childcare</strong></h2> <p>Elsewhere, services have been expanded, such as <a href=\"https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2020/03/13/coronavirus-san-francisco-emergency-child-care-centers-libraries-rec-facilities/\">public childcare centers in San Francisco</a> or <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/food/free-grab-and-go-meals-now-available-anyone-need\">providing free meals in New York</a> and <a href=\"https://civileats.com/2020/04/07/with-schools-closed-some-districts-are-feeding-more-people-than-food-banks/\">Los Angeles</a>, outgrowths of initiatives put in place after school closures <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/3/28/21197965/coronavirus-school-shutdown-free-meals\">deprived many students of meals they relied on</a>. (Interestingly, America\u2019s free meal programs took off with the Black Panther party\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.eater.com/2016/2/16/11002842/free-breakfast-schools-black-panthers\">Free Breakfast for Children</a> program, which not only provided meals to students but also organized communities.)</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://theappeal.org/food-banks-surge-demand-coronavirus-covid-19/\">food banks are struggling to keep up with increased demand</a> \u2013 with cities such as Pittsburgh seeing a <a href=\"https://www.pittsburghfoodbank.org/2020/03/12/coronavirus/\">543% increase</a> \u2013 while shuttered restaurants and decreased demand for prepared food has led to food waste and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/05/food-waste-coronavirus-pandemic-164557\">produce languishing in fields</a> against the usual backdrop of <a href=\"http://foe.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CA-Food-and-Farm-stimulus-4-sign-on-letter-final.pdf\">inadequately protected and paid</a> workers.</p> <h2><strong>Direct cash transfers</strong></h2> <p>There have also been a number of cash transfer program proposals to provide financial relief (a <a href=\"https://www.jainfamilyinstitute.org/media/research/comparing-cash-transfer-legislation/\">breakdown of the proposals is here</a>), many of which would have been unheard of just a few weeks ago.</p> <p>Unfortunately these proposals took the form of the recently passed Cares Act, which is both insufficient and means-tested. Its passage, however, further demonstrates that the \u201c<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/27/coronavirus-stimulus-package-spending/\">how will you pay for it</a>\u201d question is more about stopping progressive policies than genuine concern.</p> <h2><strong>People with foreign medical degrees can provide hospital care</strong></h2> <p>As hospitals lack beds and equipment and millions of Americans lose their jobs \u2013 and thus their health insurance \u2013 the inadequacies and cruelty of the American healthcare system (if not already obvious) is now undeniable. However, to keep up with increased need, outdated restrictions have been relaxed or lifted.</p> <p>In New York, <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/gmaniatis/status/1242852834707746816\">people with foreign medical degrees are now allowed to provide hospital care</a> \u2013 foreign-trained medical workers with advanced degrees <a href=\"https://commonwealthmagazine.org/health-care/foreign-trained-medical-professionals-waiting-to-help/\">are often relegated to low-wage, precarious work, such as driving for Uber</a>, because their degrees aren\u2019t recognized in the US. <a href=\"https://www.niskanencenter.org/states-are-temporarily-letting-doctors-chase-covid-19-across-state-lines-make-it-permanent/\">Restrictions on medical workers working across state lines</a> have been relaxed as well, while <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/490824-fda-loosens-restrictions-on-gay-men-donating-blood-amid-coronavirus\">archaic restrictions on blood donation from gay men have been eased</a> (though not entirely removed).</p> <h2>Price of insulin capped</h2> <p>As the world scrambles for Covid-19 treatments, the pharmaceutical industry has tried to secure exclusive rights on anything that looks promising. Gilead, notorious among other things for its $84,000 hepatitis C treatment, applied for and received <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/23/gilead-sciences-coronavirus-treatment-orphan-drug-status/\">orphan drug status</a> for its possible Covid-19 treatment remdesivir, a status normally reserved for drugs that treat rare illnesses (Gilead later<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/25/gilead-sciences-coronavirus-drug/\"> walked back the claim</a>).</p> <p>At the same time, Eli Lilly <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/medical-devices-and-prescription-drug-policy/491685-drugmaker-caps-insulin-costs\">capped insulin costs to $35</a> in response to the pandemic. Normally, Eli Lilly\u2019s (and other manufacturers\u2019) insulin is so unaffordable that <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/09/01/641615877/insulins-high-cost-leads-to-lethal-rationing\">people die from rationing it to save money</a>.<br></p> <h2><strong>Remote working and paid sick leave</strong></h2> <p>To maintain productivity throughout the pandemic, many employers previously resistant to remote work arrangements are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kwuchu/status/1240261206566461441\">suddenly open to them</a>. The expansion of remote work has been a long-denied <a href=\"https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/covid-19-is-proving-the-value-of-remote-work\">demand of disabled workers</a>, but only now are employers willing to consider it.</p> <p>Companies such as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21175538/amazon-coronavirus-paid-sick-leave-all-employees-relief-fund\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/10/walmart-apple-olive-garden-are-among-major-employers-updating-sick-leave-policies-coronavirus-cases-spread/\">Walmart</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21173287/instacart-coronavirus-sick-pay-workers-in-store-shoppers-covid19\">Instacart</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/07/tech/uber-coronavirus-sick-leave/index.html\">Uber</a> have revised their sick leave policies to include employees who are typically denied such benefits. But in basically all cases, this sick leave is accessible only after testing positive for Covid-19 (a difficult requirement given the scarcity of tests) and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/30/worker-strike-instacart-amazon-whole-foods/\">in the absence of other necessities like protective equipment and hazard pay</a>.</p> <p>Companies such as <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/why-uber-still-call-drivers-contractors/\">Uber persistently resist classification of their drivers as proper employees</a>, and this very limited expansion of benefits is not really a substantial change away from that policy. At the very least, however, the recently passed <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/blog/despite-some-good-provisions-the-cares-act-has-glaring-flaws-and-falls-short-of-fully-protecting-workers-during-the-coronavirus-crisis/\">C</a><a href=\"https://www.epi.org/blog/despite-some-good-provisions-the-cares-act-has-glaring-flaws-and-falls-short-of-fully-protecting-workers-during-the-coronavirus-crisis/\">ares Act expands unemployment benefits to independent contractors</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Many academic books accessible for free</strong></h2> <p>Education has been fundamentally reshaped as schools move online, with educators scrambling to adjust teaching styles and materials to remote learning. Many university presses have <a href=\"https://www.publicbooks.org/public-books-database\">made their titles accessible for free</a> in response.

The research was conducted and visualized by a team from M-Lab; the digital equity group, X-Lab; and the non-profit, Institute for Local Self-Reliance.</p> <p>The drop in connectivity is affecting both rural and urban areas with populations already underserved by the medical system or racked with poverty.</p> <p>Bronx county in New York, the poorest of New York City\u2019s five boroughs, has witnessed a sharp drop in broadband speeds.

  "<p>A draft government memo explaining how the NHS contact-tracing app could stem the spread of the coronavirus said ministers might be given the ability to order \u201cde-anonymisation\u201d to identify people from their smartphones, the Guardian can reveal.</p> \n<p>The health secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/apr/12/coronavirus-live-news-nhs-staff-deaths-boris-johnson-latest-updates\">Matt Hancock, announced on Sunday</a> that the UK planned to introduce an app that would enable people who developed Covid-19 symptoms to \u201canonymously\u201d alert other users to whom they had been in close proximity. \u201cAll data will be handled according to the highest ethical and security standards, and would only be used for NHS care and research,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>However, the government document seen by the Guardian, headed \u201cofficial \u2013 sensitive\u201d and \u201cdraft \u2013 not yet approved\u201d, suggests the NHS privately considered using the technology to identify users.</p> \n<p>Produced in March, the memo explained how an NHS app could work, using Bluetooth LE, a standard feature that runs constantly and automatically on all mobile devices, to take \u201csoundings\u201d from other nearby phones through the day. People who have been in sustained proximity with someone who may have Covid-19 could then be warned and advised to self\u2013isolate, without revealing the identity of the infected individual.</p> \n<p>However, the memo stated that \u201cmore controversially\u201d the app could use device IDs, which are unique to all smartphones, \u201cto enable de-anonymisation if ministers judge that to be proportionate at some stage\u201d. It did not say why ministers might want to identify app users, or under what circumstances doing so would be proportionate.</p> \n<p>It added that alternatives to building an NHS app included \u201cmaking use of existing apps and other functions already installed on people\u2019s phones (eg Google Maps).\u201d</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for NHSX, the digital transformation wing of the health service, which is overseeing the development of the UK contact-tracing app, denied there were ever plans to de-anonymise data, or use data from apps such as Google Maps.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cNHSX is looking at whether app-based solutions might be helpful in tracking and managing coronavirus, and we have assembled expertise from inside and outside the organisation to do this as rapidly as possible,\u201d the spokesperson said.</p> \n<p>\u201cTo be very clear \u2013 there have never been plans to make use of existing apps and other functions already installed on peoples phones such as Google Maps and neither have there been plans to look to use the device ID of users in any app-based solutions.\u201d</p> \n<p>NHSX plans to harness data for the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic were made public after confidential documents, used by private contractors, were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/uk-government-using-confidential-patient-data-in-coronavirus-response\">made accessible via an unrestricted portal that was seen by the Guardian</a>. </p> \n<p>On Friday, Google and Apple announced an unprecedented collaboration to provide the back-end technology that will enable governments to introduce contact-tracing apps that run on both iPhones and Android phones. Hancock did not specify which technology the government would use but said the NHS was \u201cworking closely with the world\u2019s leading tech companies\u201d.</p> \n<p>Explaining how the NHS app would work, Hancock said: \u201cIf you become unwell with the symptoms of coronavirus, you can securely tell this new NHS app and the app will then send an alert anonymously to other app users that you\u2019ve been in significant contact with over the past few days, even before you had symptoms, so that they know and can act accordingly.\u201d</p> \n<p>Advocates of contact-tracing apps argue they could prove a vital tool to help governments emerge from lockdown conditions currently restricting the movement of millions. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Covid-19%3A%20help%20us%20investigate&amp;description=The%20Guardian%20is%20investigating%20how%20the%20UK%20government%20prepared%20for%20%E2%80%93%20and%20is%20responding%20to%20%E2%80%93%20the%20coronavirus%20pandemic.%20We%20want%20to%20learn%20more%20about%20recent%20decisions%20taken%20at%20the%20heart%20of%20government.%20If%20you\u2019re%20a%20whistleblower%20or%20source%20and%20with%20new%20information%2C%20you%20can%20email%20%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22mailto%3Acovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Ecovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20(using%20a%20non-work%20phone)%20use%20Signal%20or%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447584640566%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566.%20(The%20number%20does%20not%20take%20calls.)%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E%20and%20for%20general%20advice%20on%20confidentially%20contacting%20the%20Guardian%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"The Guardian is investigating how the UK government prepared for \u2013 and is responding to \u2013 the coronavirus pandemic.

The notion of \u201cde-anonymisation\u201d of users, in particular, would appear to contradict advice given by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) that identifying individuals from their location data may breach privacy law.</p> \n<p>The deputy information commissioner <a href=\"https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2020/03/statement-in-response-to-the-use-of-mobile-phone-tracking-data-to-help-during-the-coronavirus-crisis/\">said in a recent statement</a> that data protection laws were not infringed as long as location data was \u201cproperly anonymised and aggregated\u201d.

Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, recently wrote that \u201canyone who\u2019s worked on abuse will instantly realise that a voluntary app operated by anonymous actors is wide open to trolling\u201d.</p>",

The coronavirus crisis, the ensuing lockdown and widespread pressure on health services were blamed for the delay. But with heel-dragging and wilful ignorance becoming synonymous with Northern Ireland\u2019s leading parties, campaigners and clinicians criticised anti-choice sentiment for slowing down the implementation of abortion services. DUP and UUP assembly members had still been resisting change.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/northern-ireland-confirms-abortions-can-now-be-carried-out\">Northern Ireland confirms abortions can now be carried out</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Health trusts readied themselves to deliver services, but were halted by the Department of Health. Women\u2019s bodies were, still, used in capricious political gameplay \u2013 pawns yet again in poisonous tribal politics.</p> <p>Even worse, the political line became one of gaslighting \u2013 Northern Ireland\u2019s health minister, Robin Swann, and the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, resisted calls for telemedicine to provide abortion pills to people safely at home. They also stated that travelling to England was still a viable option.</p> <p>While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/relaxation-of-uk-abortion-rules-welcomed-by-experts-coronavirus\">telemedicine was introduced</a> in the rest of the UK, and separately in Ireland, they recklessly inferred that pregnant people in Northern Ireland should defy government guidelines to stay at home. With strained health services and travel restrictions, scarce flights and hotels closed, it was a terrifying prospect, and in many cases totally impossible.</p> <p>Campaigners pointed out that the only available route to safe abortion care in England was a ludicrous eight-hour freight ferry to Birkenhead. We heard of women self-harming and at least one who <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-nireland-abortion/northern-irish-women-told-to-sail-to-england-for-abortions-despite-pandemic-idUSKBN21P2S1\">attempted </a><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-nireland-abortion/northern-irish-women-told-to-sail-to-england-for-abortions-despite-pandemic-idUSKBN21P2S1\"> to take her own life</a> when they couldn\u2019t get terminations. Worry grew that such barriers, as the country\u2019s shameful past shows, would lead women to make desperate, dangerous decisions. In a year that was poised to be one of liberation and body autonomy for people long treated as second-class citizens in Northern Ireland, access to care was suddenly worse than ever.</p> <p>Late on Thursday, Northern Ireland authorities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/northern-ireland-confirms-abortions-can-now-be-carried-out\">confirmed</a> that early abortions can now be carried out in local hospitals. It\u2019s a historic occasion, but it is not difficult to see the efforts of some Stormont politicians to deliberately impede the rollout of free, safe, legal, local abortion care for anyone who may need it.Long-awaited access to abortion services is a result of thunderous public pressure and pro-choice groups threatening legal action. Once again, it\u2019s been down to campaigners, activists, and healthcare professionals to bring about the vital modernisation of reproductive care in line with the rest of the UK.</p> <p>Grassroots organisers and charities have filled the gap in the years when Stormont languished without a functioning assembly and in the stormy months since its restoration. They have refused to stand by as women\u2019s health became a political bargaining chip, while an international health crisis raged.</p> <p>Alliance for Choice, a valiant local group, stepped in to post pills for self-managed abortions, in line with regulations, while the British Pregnancy Advice Service launched its own scheme for abortion medication by post. The swift action on telemedicine for pregnant people in the UK and Ireland \u2013 something still unavailable in the north \u2013 only further amplifies the inequality gap and contemptible political unwillingness to protect women in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Civil society battling back against government callousness will be a legacy of the coronavirus crisis.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Spain sees another fall in daily death toll</h2> <p>Spain\u2019s overnight death toll <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-italy-new-york-death-tolls-slow-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9434798f082dfd549d567d#block-5e9434798f082dfd549d567d\">from coronavirus fell to 517</a> on Monday from Sunday\u2019s 619, bringing the total death toll to 17,489, the health ministry said, adding that it was the smallest proportional daily increase since tracking began. The ministry said in a statement that overall cases rose to 169,496 from 166,019. Meanwhile, restrictions have been lifted for some businesses after shutting down all non-essential operations nearly two weeks ago. This will allow businesses that cannot operate remotely, including construction and manufacturing, to reopen. The move has been criticised by some as risking a resurgence in the spread of the virus.</p> <h2>Major oil-producing nations agree historic 10% cut in output</h2> <p>The world\u2019s largest oil producers have agreed a historic deal to cut global oil production by almost 10% to protect the market against the impact of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/government-under-fire-over-ppe-and-testing-as-uk-death-toll-passes-10000\">coronavirus pandemic</a>. Members of the Opec oil cartel and its allies have agreed to withhold almost 10m barrels a day from next month after the outbreak of Covid-19 wiped out demand for fossil fuels and triggered a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/10/opec-russia-reduce-oil-production-prop-up-prices\">collapse in global oil prices</a>.</p> <h2>Iran\u2019s death toll rises to 4,585 \u2013 up by 111</h2> <p>The country\u2019s death toll from the new coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-italy-new-york-death-tolls-slow-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9432b68f081a236f1925c2#block-5e9432b68f081a236f1925c2\">has risen to 4,585</a>, with 111 deaths overnight, a health ministry official said, adding the total number of infected cases had reached 73,303 in the most-affected Middle Eastern country. \u201cFortunately 45,983 of those infected with the virus have recovered ... There were 1,617 new infected cases in the past 24 hours,\u201d tweeted Alireza Vahabzadeh, an adviser to Iran\u2019s health minister.</p> <h2><strong>China</strong> <strong>reports 108 new virus cases</strong></h2> <p>According to reports, 98 of the 108 cases were imported from overseas, its highest figure since early March. The country where the disease first emerged has largely brought its domestic outbreak under control, but it faces a fresh battle against imported infections, mostly Chinese nationals returning home.</p> <h2><strong>Widespread testing needed in the US</strong></h2> <p>The US needs to ramp up testing for the coronavirus, health experts have said, as the White House considers when and how to lift stay-at-home restrictions and lockdowns triggered by the pandemic. Diagnostic testing determines if somebody is infected with the virus and antibody testing shows who has been infected and is therefore immune. Both will be important in getting people back into the workplace and containing the virus as that happens, the experts said.</p> <h2><strong>WHO looking at reports of patients testing positive again</strong></h2> <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Saturday that it was looking into reports of Covid-19 patients testing positive again after clinically recovering from the disease. South Korean officials had reported on Friday that 91 patients cleared of the new coronavirus had tested positive again. Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told a briefing that the virus may have been \u201creactivated\u201d rather than the patients being re-infected.</p> <h2>Pop-up bike lanes help with coronavirus social distancing in Germany</h2> <p>German cities are redrawing road markings to create \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/pop-up-bike-lanes-help-with-coronavirus-social-distancing-in-germany\">pop-up cycle lanes</a>\u201d for the duration of the Covid-19 lockdown, as cyclists demand more space to socially distance on their commute to work. Local authorities in Berlin\u2019s Kreuzberg district trialled a temporary widening of two cycle lanes on 27 March, arguing it would help cyclists keep the required 1.5-metre distance apart while car traffic was down owing to Germany\u2019s current coronavirus restrictions.</p>",

I texted with my grandmother, who\u2019s almost 90 and lives in Idaho with my grandfather. She told me about how she feels like a prisoner because her kids, who live nearby, bring them everything she needs and instructed them to stay inside.</p> <p>When I was finally finished, I found my husband and kids all waiting in the car at the hospital\u2019s parking garage.

But the very first thing I asked was whether any of them got out of the car. The kids had gotten out in the parking garage to look over the side for just a few moments. So as soon as we got home, I sprayed Lysol on the bottom of their shoes.</p> <p>Sometimes I forget what it was like when I could just go out for a drink with my husband or go shopping with my kids.

  "<p>Fears of coronavirus-induced shortages have sparked a desire to grow our own food, but getting hold of supplies isn\u2019t easy when popping to the garden centre is out of the question. Here\u2019s how to overcome some of the common obstacles to harvesting your first crop.</p> <h2><strong>You haven\u2019t got a clue</strong></h2> <p>Being on hand at home to care for your plants\u2019 needs means you will quickly learn what makes them thrive. But you must set out with the right mindset. Treat everything you grow as an experiment: if you manage a small harvest, that\u2019s a perk rather than the goal.</p> <p>Don\u2019t assume that you can plant seeds of 20 different veg now, and within a month be able to spurn supermarket produce. Although a few crops can be ready in just a few weeks, such as radishes and salad leaves, most take months to reach maturity, and even the most seasoned gardeners experience failures because of pests (slugs: I mean you), late frosts that kill fruit-tree blossom or a bad batch of seed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52ba60414cf61519dccb32094cb8204bd1e032f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52ba60414cf61519dccb32094cb8204bd1e032f9/543_1_4396_2639/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chillies need to be sown now.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chillies need to be sown now.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: dla4/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s the process of growing that is your reward: you\u2019ll soon become addicted to the thrill of spying your very first flash of green leaf against compost as your seeds sprout. If there are children in your household, get them involved. They are much more likely to eat something they helped to cultivate, and every aspect of growing involves some kind of home-schooling activity, from counting out seeds and writing labels for younger children to learning about photosynthesis and transpiration for older ones.</p> <p>Reach back in your mind to school biology lessons, and you will remember that all plants have the same basic needs: water and nutrients for the roots, and light, air and warmth for the leaves. Beyond that, every vegetable has its own ideal growing conditions. Some \u2013 such as tomatoes, chillies, courgettes and aubergines \u2013 need a long season to mature, so these need to be sown now if you want any chance of a crop. Others, such as lettuce, mature more quickly and can be sown in small amounts throughout the growing season.</p> <p>The internet is awash with advice, a great deal of it misleading \u2013 so ignore those viral videos about sowing herbs in glass jars; it won\u2019t work. However, you can\u2019t go far wrong starting with <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/,\">the Royal Horticultural Society website</a>, while the <a href=\"https://www.gardenorganic.org.uk/growing-advice\">charity Garden Organic </a>has plenty of guides to growing organically. </p> <h2><strong>You haven\u2019t got any seeds</strong></h2> <p>If the panic-buying run on vegetable seeds has left your local shops lacking, and you can\u2019t face yet another online order, have a rummage. If you locate some packets, unopened or opened, at the back of a drawer, it\u2019s worth sowing them, as many seeds remain viable long after the \u201cbest before\u201d date.</p> <p>Even if you draw a blank on that, your kitchen is full of other possibilities: there\u2019s no harm in sowing seeds plucked from the inside of a pepper or strained from the pulp of a tomato, although the results may be less predictable than those from a packet. If you have whole seeds of coriander, dill, fennel or fenugreek, you can sprout them as microgreens (see \u201cNo outdoor space\u201d, below). You can also regrow the bases of celery, onions and lettuce by placing them in a shallow dish of water. And you can raise pea shoots from dried peas. Growers are discouraged from planting sprouted spuds from the veg rack \u2013 certified disease-free seed potatoes specially produced for the grow-your-own market are safer \u2013 but many people report great harvests from discarded potatoes. For more ideas, get hold of the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/No-Waste-Kitchen-Gardening-Regrow-Leftover/dp/0760361606\">No-Waste Kitchen Gardening by Katie Elzer-Peters</a>.</p> <p>If you have your own outside space, there may be things already thriving there that you can eat: some plants maligned as weeds are useful edibles, while there are ornamentals that are tasty, too. The young, tender leaves of the lime tree (<em>Tilia</em>) and the ice plant (<em>Hylotelephium spectabile</em>) can both be used in salads. But for safety\u2019s sake, make sure no one has been spraying weedkiller around, stick to your own space and remember many plants are highly toxic, such as giant hogweed and foxglove.</p> <p>Start with plants you can identify without a shadow of doubt, such as dandelions and nettles, and expand your knowledge using the <a href=\"https://pfaf.org/\">Plants for a Future</a> website or Adele Nozedar\u2019s book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Garden-Forager-Edible-Delights-your/dp/0224098896\">The Garden Forager</a>. Stick a bucket over a patch of dandelions and within a few days you will have blanched bitter leaves with many uses in the kitchen, from salads and sauteed greens to soups and pasta dishes. Soaking greens in a large bowl of heavily salted water then rinsing thoroughly removes dirt and unwanted hitchhikers, such as aphids.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1def6ba0f5278a278abe2be5a2f4fddc45f3d0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1def6ba0f5278a278abe2be5a2f4fddc45f3d0e/307_578_4527_2716/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plant up bare patches in the flowerbeds with kale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plant up bare patches in the flowerbeds with kale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><br>You haven\u2019t got any soil</strong></h2> <p>Like seeds, compost is harder to source right now. Many of the DIY sheds are offering click-and-collect services for compost, however, while some garden centres will deliver to your door; Dalefoot and Fertile Fibre, two high quality peat-free compost brands, offer a mail-order service. If none of these is an option for you, all is not lost.</p> <p>If you have some lawn, cut away the turf using a spade (stack it into black plastic sacks and it will rot down into crumbly soil in about a year) and prepare a veg bed. Those with compost heaps already on the go are at an advantage, as good compost takes a few months to make: scrape off the top layer of uncomposted material, and you may find treasure below \u2013 it\u2019s ready when the worms have moved on to leave black, crumbly compost the consistency of a wrung-out sponge behind. Homemade compost isn\u2019t suitable for seed sowing, but you can add it as a layer of mulch to the top of veg beds and pots or dig it into the soil to add vital nutrients and organic matter.</p> <p>If you have flowerbeds with perennials, plant up bare patches with perennial vegetables such as welsh onions, rhubarb, perennial kale and sorrel, as well as perennial herbs, such as rosemary, chives, sage and thyme. You can also sow nasturtium seeds direct \u2013 the leaves and flowers are edible \u2013 or, beyond the end of May, when all danger of frost is past, plant out tender veg, such as tomatoes and courgettes. Just make sure you provide these hungry plants with extra nutrients through a liquid or granular feed.</p> <p>Tempting though it may be, don\u2019t fill pots with garden soil, as it\u2019s almost always too heavy to drain properly, and may well be full of eggs of slugs and other pests. Pots containing compost used for growing in previous years can be reused: tip it out and remove any weeds and any white C-shaped grubs, which are the larvae of the vine weevil. Add slow-release fertiliser such as <a href=\"https://www.organiccatalogue.com/products/seaweed-meal_mh6782\">Chase Seaweed Meal</a> and your revived compost is ready to go.</p> <p>If you have regular compost, but no seed compost, run what you have through an old sieve to remove the lumpy bits \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter for larger seeds, such as courgettes and beans.</p> <h2><strong>You haven\u2019t got a garden</strong></h2> <p>A balcony, a set of steps, a tiny patio or a couple of window boxes will still serve as growing spaces: just scale your range of crops accordingly. Watch where the sun rises to work out the aspect of your patch, as this will dictate what you can grow. South-facing sunny spots are ideal for growing most things, particularly tomatoes, herbs, chillies and french beans, while shady north-facing patches offer more limited options, including salad leaves, swiss chard, mint, sorrel and coriander. Don\u2019t forget to grow upwards: any vertical can be covered with trellis or wires to act as climbing frames for beans, peas, climbing squash or nasturtiums. Check out <a href=\"https://verticalveg.org.uk/\">Vertical Veg\u2019s website for</a> more tips and advice on small-space growing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"756ca5c9b913953efedce53c72280ec6f2ceee1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/756ca5c9b913953efedce53c72280ec6f2ceee1f/46_498_5060_3036/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tender veg, such as courgettes, need to go out at the end of May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tender veg, such as courgettes, need to go out at the end of May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>You haven\u2019t got any outdoor space</strong></h2> <p>Windowsills and ledges won\u2019t produce a huge harvest, but you can have the satisfaction of watching your plants grow up close. Your main limitation is lack of light: scope out your sunniest windowsill and requisition it for growing. If you are an impatient type, sprouting seeds and microgreens are your answer: you can sprout dried lentils, chickpeas and many other pulses and seeds by soaking them overnight then placing in a glass jar with a piece of fine muslin secured across the opening so that you can regularly rinse them with water as they grow, but a <a href=\"https://www.realfoods.co.uk/product/1397/bean-and-seed-sprouter\">tray sprouter will allow you to up production</a>. Microgreens take sprouting one step further, allowing seeds such as mustard, coriander and fenugreek to grow to 3-5cm tall before they are snipped. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Speedy-Vegetable-Garden-Mark-Diacono/dp/1604693266\">Speedy Vegetable Garden</a> by Mark Diacono and Lia Leendertz explains both techniques in detail.</p> <h2><strong>You haven\u2019t got any pots</strong></h2> <p>Fashion containers out of whatever you have to hand: an old kitchen bin or builder\u2019s bucket makes a great container for potatoes or a single tomato or chilli plant. You\u2019ll need to add drainage holes to the bottom of any container, so that excess water can run out \u2013 without that, plants\u2019 roots will rot. Remember that plants in containers will need regular feeding and daily watering in hot weather.</p> <p>On a smaller scale, plastic food trays for fruit and meat \u2013 and yoghurt pots of all sizes \u2013 are perfect for growing microgreens and starting off vegetable seeds. </p>",
  "<p>I once had to prepare a class of American students for their very first pantomime. The more I talked, the more I lost confidence. I sounded preposterous. What could possibly be appealing about the eccentric mix of fairytale, music hall and folk tradition I was trying to enthuse them with?</p> <p>As it happened, they loved it. Evidently, the joy of panto is beyond words. You just have to be there.</p> <p>In these days of coronavirus lockdown, however, being there is no longer an option. Which is why going online to watch <a href=\"https://www.mercurytheatre.co.uk/cinderella-online/\">Ryan McBryde\u2019s production of </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.mercurytheatre.co.uk/cinderella-online/\">Cinderella</a></strong> (<strong>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606</strong>) leaves me conflicted.</p> <p>On the one hand, it\u2019s a generous idea to share a show with housebound families for this Easter week \u2013 and a clever way to campaign for funds for the <a href=\"https://www.mercurytheatre.co.uk/support/get-involved/mercury-rising-faqs/\">Mercury Theatre Colchester\u2019s \u00a39.8m redevelopment project</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9cWnz6uGLM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h9cWnz6uGLM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>On the other hand, watching such an exuberant and interactive form in the solitude of your living room makes you feel oddly detached. It isn\u2019t us shouting out our names to Mari McGinlay\u2019s self-assured Ella when she asks us to introduce ourselves. It isn\u2019t us getting peed on by the Ugly Sisters\u2019 dogs as they carry them around in their handbags. And it isn\u2019t us joining in a competitive bout of Get Me to the Church on Time before the final curtain.</p> <p>None of this is a massive loss, but it\u2019s enough to take the edge off a classy production. Pantomime trades on controlled chaos, something that needs you in the same room as the unfolding anarchy. What must have seemed naughty, rambunctious and funny on stage too often feels tame on screen. As a result, the fairy-story romance between McGinlay\u2019s no-nonsense heroine and Samuel Knight\u2019s Prince Charming comes across best.</p> <p>As pantos go, this Cinderella is at the posher end of the scale. Less the rough-and-ready vigour of the music hall (although Mercury regulars Antony Stuart-Hicks and Dale Superville provide grit as the Ugly Sisters), more the polish of legit actors lending psychological depth to Andrew Pollard\u2019s script. That\u2019s when they\u2019re not being put through their musical-theatre paces on the free-range soundtrack put together by musical director Nick Barstow. In one medley alone they go from Meghan Trainor\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PCkvCPvDXk\">All About That Bass</a> to Rosemary Clooney\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG7x8HWbDzU\">Sisters</a>.</p> <p>Ticking all the panto boxes, Pollard jazzes things up with a cross-dressing Dandini, going in disguise to improve her work prospects. It adds a touch of Twelfth Night playfulness, works in a spot of feminist commentary and gives an excellent Nerine Skinner the chance to exercise her comedic muscles.

  "<p>In January 1994, Santiago Klein was taking a break from city life with a beach holiday in Uruguay. \u201cIt was a popular place for people living in Argentina to visit. I started talking to Gisela\u2019s sister because she knows my sister,\u201d he recalls. It wasn\u2019t long before the pair were introduced, and he asked if she wanted to go on a date later that day. \u201cI noticed her eyes at first, and I really liked her.\u201d They arranged to go out at midnight. \u201cIn Latin America, we go out late and stay out until 5am,\u201d says Santiago. \u201cI went out for dinner with my family first and they asked about my date but I couldn\u2019t remember her name. I just knew there was something about her I really liked.\u201d</p> <p>Keen to impress his date, he admits he was showing off at the start. \u201cAt first, I thought he was a bit full of himself, but I soon realised he was really down to earth and lovely,\u201d says Gisela. \u201cI went home and told my mum and auntie that I\u2019d found the man I was going to marry.\u201d</p> <p>Santiago felt the same way. \u201cWe had lots in common and wanted the same things in life. In the space of a couple of hours I knew I would marry her.\u201d Though they were both coming out of long-term relationships, something felt right between them. \u201cI had never thought about marriage before and suddenly I just knew,\u201d says Santiago.</p> <p>A few days later, he returned to Buenos Aires for work, while Gisela continued her holiday. \u201cHe came back to Uruguay a week later and he proposed,\u201d she says. \u201cWe went to a market seller there and he bought the rings.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2678a7580d02b40de5291571424693e6cf4aa20e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2678a7580d02b40de5291571424693e6cf4aa20e/0_0_3282_2650/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Santiago and Gisela on their wedding day in 1994.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"807\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Santiago and Gisela on their wedding day in 1994.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Santiago Klein</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gisela was also living in Buenos Aires at the time, and the pair returned to the city together after their travels were over. \u201cI joke that she comes from the posh bit of the city, like Chelsea in London,\u201d says Santiago. \u201cAnd I am from the equivalent of Hendon.\u201d The couple arranged their wedding for 6 November 1994, exactly 10 months after they met. \u201cWe wanted it to be the same day of the month,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Before the wedding, the couple had to tell their parents about their plans. \u201cWe went for dinner with my family and we just kept on ordering more food,\u201d says Gisella. \u201cHe was so nervous about telling them.\u201d Eventually Santiago plucked up courage. \u201cMy father-in-law looked at me, finished drinking his coffee and then said: \u2018I knew you would marry her; I just thought you\u2019d wait a bit longer.\u2019 They\u2019d only known me for about 15 minutes.\u201d</p> <p>Since they married, the couple have had three children, Freddie, Maggie and Max. They have lived in both the UK and the US, moving around for Santiago\u2019s work in property development while Gisela cared for the children. The first move came in 2001, during a period of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/dec/21/argentina.ukigoni\">riots and instability in Argentina</a>. \u201cThings weren\u2019t good at home, so when Santiago suggested the move I thought \u2018Why not?\u2019,\u201d says Gisela. She admits life in the UK was hard at first as she spoke no English and had young children. \u201cOver 10 years, I learned to really love it.\u201d</p> <p>In 2010, the family moved to Florida. \u201cWe knew it wasn\u2019t going to be for us long-term,\u201d Santiago says. \u201cWe said we needed to move back home but neither of us knew whether that meant Argentina or the UK.\u201d</p> <p>They moved to England again in 2016. As well as having plenty of friends in the UK, Gisela says they love the \u201cfairness\u201d of British society. \u201cIt feels like a caring place to live.\u201d But they visit their family in Argentina as often as they can \u2013 and at Christmas and New Year they return to the beach in Uruguay where they met.</p> <p>Santiago says their marriage has always felt right. \u201cShe complements me so well. And I have always loved the way she smiles with her eyes and not just her mouth.\u201d Gisela has always known that she and her husband were meant to be. \u201cHe has lots of regrets in life, but he always says he has never regretted marrying me, not once.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Want to share your story?

  "<p>Stock dealing by some members of the US Congress, or their spouses and associates, has sparked a flurry of questions over whether politicians have used information they received in congressional briefings to profit from the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting economic shutdown.</p> <p>Senators Richard Burr and Kelly Loeffler have received the majority of the focus. Both senators traded stocks after receiving private briefings about the virus.</p> <p>Those moves have spurred questions about whether some lawmakers are using private information available to members of Congress on key intelligence committees to make stock decisions as some companies have floundered because of the pandemic and others have flourished.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/27/jeff-bezos-sold-34bn-of-amazon-stock-just-before-covid-19-collapse\">Jeff Bezos sold $3.4bn of Amazon stock just before Covid-19 collapse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The justice department has begun an investigation into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/20/republican-senators-sold-stocks-before-markets-plunged-on-coronavirus-fears-reports\">stock moves by Burr</a> and the FBI has also contacted the North Carolina senator. Loeffler and Burr have denied any wrongdoing. Burr, in a statement, stressed that he only used public information in making the trades and requested an investigation by the Senate ethics committee.</p> <p>Members of Congress are barred from using the information they get in their committees in making stock trades. They are also subject to the same insider trading laws as the public.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s problematic. Senators are powerful people who receive and have access to information that not everybody has and that fact can create an impression that anytime they have success in the stock market they may have used unfair advantage to get there,\u201d said Gregg Nunziata, a lawyer who served as a senior policy adviser and general counsel to Senator Marco Rubio.</p> <p>Nunziata said it would be better if members of Congress placed assets in a blind trust or mutual funds.</p> <p>Burr has been one of the main focuses of the scandal. The chairman of the Senate intelligence committee sold off somewhere between $628,000 and $1.72m of his stock portfolio on 13 February. That sale came after Burr said publicly that the country was prepared for a pandemic like coronavirus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d8f803f65ca9387db23fb00d1da841720c93bf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d8f803f65ca9387db23fb00d1da841720c93bf1/0_193_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Senator Richard Burr, the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, sold off stock after pandemic comments in February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Senator Richard Burr, the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, sold off stock after pandemic comments in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But privately, Burr warned a small set of representatives for North Carolina organizations and businesses, about the serious social and economic impacts of the coronavirus in late February. Burr\u2019s moves and the comments were especially notable because as chairman of the intelligence committee, Burr has access to classified information related to American security.</p> <p>Loeffler, the newest member of the Senate, sold tens of millions of dollars worth of stocks weeks after a closed Senate briefing on the coronavirus. In the following weeks after the sales, Loeffler stressed publicly the country\u2019s preparedness to handle the virus without taking extreme measures.</p> <p>Loeffler\u2019s sales have also raised eyebrows because her husband serves as the president of the New York stock exchange.</p> <p>Both senators have denied any wrongdoing.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal published an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/us/politics/kelly-loeffler-coronavirus-stock-trades.html\">op-ed</a> by Loeffler announcing that she would divest from individual stocks and instead move into exchange-traded funds and mutual funds. In the weeks after the sales, Loeffler urged calm about the coronavirus.</p> <p>Other lawmakers who have made stock trades recently have been scrutinized as well. The Georgia senator David Perdue\u2019s stock portfolio went through heavy trading during March. In that month, three spending bills went through Congress in response to the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, the <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/david-perdue-stock-trading-saw-uptick-coronavirus-took-hold/MRWmzwXeHgxi6IcmBbPgaN/\">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a> noted.</p> <p>The California senator Dianne Feinstein, another member of the Senate intelligence committee, <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/Feinstein-denies-wrongdoing-in-stock-sale-before-15145862.php\">sold</a> somewhere between $1.5m and $6m in stock of Allogene Therapeutics, a biotechnology company.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just lawmakers themselves; their spouses have been active in stock trading. In the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, the House speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband spent $3.3m buying up tech stocks that would probably surge during a coronavirus pandemic: Alphabet, Microsoft and Slack, according to Barron\u2019s. The Oklahoma senator Jim Inhofe\u2019s account manager sold as much as $750,000 in stocks in January, near the stock market\u2019s high so far this year.</p> <p>The Vermont online website VTDigger <a href=\"https://vtdigger.org/2020/03/24/welch-profited-from-investment-in-covid-19-testing-firm/\">reported</a> that roughly a month ago the Vermont congressman Peter Welch bought $7,500 in stock in Qiagen, a company that produces coronavirus tests. He said it was made through his investment adviser. Welch sold the stock in late March and he said he would donate the profits to charity. Welch only made a few hundred dollars off the trade.</p> <p>Still, Nunziata said that the types of market behavior that raise ethics or public perception concerns by members of Congress \u201coften would fall short of the statutory crime of insider trading\u201d.</p> <p>None of the mentioned members of Congress have been found guilty of insider trading. But the behavior of lawmakers and officials concerning specific companies has raised eyebrows from experts.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just stupid for Burr to be doing this stuff,\u201d said a former Republican Senate chief of staff. \u201cIs it criminal? I don\u2019t know, they haven\u2019t established it yet. But the guy\u2019s getting raked over the coals for it and he\u2019s got to make a better defense of himself than he\u2019s done up till now.\u201d</p> <p>Other lawmakers and senior aides have <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/coronavirus-trading-house-senate-140260\">made trades</a> of companies that have been sensitive to the pandemic \u2013 such as Clorox Inc, biotechnology companies, cruise ship companies and airlines. None of those trades were as large as the ones made by Loeffler and Burr, though.</p> <p>Donald Langevoort, a Georgetown University law professor who specializes in securities regulation, said the impression lawmakers can give from making big trades during a major crisis can send the public a bad message about the lawmakers\u2019 priorities.</p> <p>\u201cThese episodes just create the impression of: here\u2019s somebody who thought the best thing to do with her time and attention is manage the stock portfolio,\u201d Langevoort said.</p> <p>A bill passed in 2012, the Stock Act, bars members of Congress and government employees from using non-public information from buying or selling stocks. Burr was one of the few votes opposing that bill.</p> <p>A trio of House lawmakers are supporting a more strict bill, the Humble Act, which would bar members of Congress from owning individual stocks. That bill has five sponsors.</p>",

Kev Inn\u2019s speakers are clearly two aspects of one self: they\u2019re both on the same side, but one, the questioner, is plain angry and wants active opposition to \u201cthe power\u201d, while the other counsels inaction, his voice desolately wise, his anger repressed. The effect is that of a vigorous impulse to action hitting a soft brick wall, a seemingly suffocating and impassable cushion of common sense. The answering \u201cvoice\u201d frequently argues that things are not as bad as they once were. Then, however, there\u2019s a \u201cbut\u201d that leads to a brief narrative showing how bad they still are. By enumerating the details of a relentlessly continuing micro-racism, the answers are not, in fact, placatory at all, and potentially provide further motivation to \u201cfight the power\u201d \u2013 insidious and masked though that power has become.</p> <p>The purpose isn\u2019t to write a realist piece of dialogue, but to chant an incantation that builds a picture of an unjust society at various points in time. In many of the verses, history informs the present \u2013 almost become the present: \u201cCan I tear down the barricades? // Nah, it wasn\u2019t a Jim Crow lunch counter, but this waiter took fifteen minutes to serve me.\u201d Hypocrisy, more likely today than in periods that tolerated of blatant racism, is indicted: \u201cCan I rage against the machine? // Nah, he didn\u2019t say \u2018it\u2019s cos the other lads would object,\u2019 but he didn\u2019t wanna hire me.\u201d</p> <p>The penultimate verse has a different structure from the rest: its two terse questions illuminate an issue that much of the chapbook investigates, the so-called \u201cpost-racial\u201d society. The last verse repeats the bleak and pointless question of the second \u201cCan I throw a bottle?\u201d as if there were no alternatives left. The answer is a grim allusion to the brutality and dishonesty of \u201cthe power\u201d.</p> <p>Can I fight the power? is both contemporary and traditional. It echoes some ancient genres \u2013 the pastoral eclogue, the conversation between an adventuring hero and an oracle, interaction between the protagonist of a Greek tragedy and the chorus. There\u2019s an element of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_and_response_(music)\">call-and-response singing</a>, too. </p> <p>As the pattern unfurls its series of questions and answers, society\u2019s more occult means of delivering racism are highlighted. We learn more about the pain of insult and marginalisation than we would from a list of the major injustices. But these, too, are hoveringly present at many points in the poem. For instance, the reference to police violence rouses memories of the anti-Nazi protests of April 1979, and <a href=\"https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/day-blair-peach-died-%E2%80%93-personal-account\">the killing of Blair Peach</a>. </p> <p>Can I fight the power? reveals the pervasiveness and tenacity of racism: masked by wishful thinking or a liberal illusion \u2013 genuinely held but based on ignorance \u2013 that it no longer exists, it becomes all the harder to uproot. There is still a depth of fertile soil in society and the psyche which goes on nourishing racism, and other groundless hatreds based on myth or a moment\u2019s snap judgment. The \u201cpower\u201d is still very much the power.</p> <p>Notes: COINTELPRO \u2013 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO\">Counter Intelligence Programme</a>. </p> <p>\u201cCan I take it to the man?\u201d: the man is the white man, the system. Kev Inn explains that the phrase draws on black artists\u2019 use of coding, and points to the lyrics of Swamp Dogg\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRrTsCslbho\">I Was Born Blue</a>, the song Mr Charlie (title from James Baldwin\u2019s eponymous play) and <a href=\"https://www.theartstory.org/artist/ringgold-faith/artworks/\">Faith Ringgold\u2019s artworks</a>. </p>",

Staff also requested showers be installed so they could wash before going home to their families, but the portable showers did not have heaters \u2013 and Tasmania is cold in April.</p> <p>Staff were also initially working across wards, going from wards that housed people with Covid-19 to wards with no known cases.</p> <p>Veitch said epidemiologists were working to trace the spread from the 60 known cases.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lesser possibility of it spreading from the inanimate environment to people, but we\u2019ll be looking particularly at how it could have passed from person to person through the hospital community,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Reports began circulating that the virus may have spread at a party allegedly held by hospital workers, which Shepherd said was an \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d and hurtful rumour.</p> <p>\u201cThey feel a sense of failure, like they have been shut down,\u201d Shepherd said. \u201cTo have those unsubstantiated rumours on top of that is very upsetting.\u201d</p> <p>Twenty-three people who were in hospitals in Burnie were transferred to the Mersey Community hospital in Devonport, 46km down the coast, on Monday.</p> <p>Tasmania\u2019s health minister, Sarah Courtney, said Mersey hospital \u201chas the PPE it needs\u201d but had also been advised to ensure \u201cgeographical separation of patients who are Covid positive as well as patients who are not Covid positive\u201d.</p> <p>The defence force was called in to thoroughly clean and disinfect both North West hospitals, with the aim of getting the emergency department running again. In the meantime, Courtney said, they had increased ambulance resources and aeromedical support.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to reassure all Tasmanians that if you\u2019re on the north-west coast and you\u2019re experiencing a medical emergency, please do not hesitate to call 000,\u201d Courtney said. \u201cWe have plans in place to make sure that you get the highest-quality care.\u201d</p> <p>Aged care providers stopped accepting residents returning from either North West Regional or North West Private hospitals last week. At least one aged care home has told staff they would only provide masks to residents who have symptoms and are in isolation, and recommended staff forgo PPE in other circumstances.</p> <p>Jacobson said those reports were \u201calarming\u201d and there was no reason for aged care homes, which have been given priority access to the national medical stockpile, not to have access to adequate PPE.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/the-coronavirus-response-has-created-a-more-accessible-society-but-how-long-will-it-last\">The coronavirus response has created a more accessible society \u2013 but how long will it last?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Challenging community ambivalence</h2> <p>Before this weekend, it was sometimes difficult to convince locals to take the threat of coronavirus seriously, said Burnie mayor Steve Kons.</p> <p>\u201cThe attitude certainly changed in the last week or so,\u201d Kons said. \u201cBeing an isolated place you don\u2019t have the expectation that you will be impacted as much as other areas. But what\u2019s happened to the hospital up here and the isolation orders has certainly driven the message home.\u201d</p> <p>More than 20 people were charged with breaching public health orders over the weekend, including two men who took a 500km round trip from Railton to Strahan \u2013two north-west towns \u2013 to purchase a car for sale on the side of the road.</p> <p>\u201cWith the additional stronger restrictions on retail activity now in place in the north-west \u2013 there are fewer reasons to leave your home,\u201d said acting deputy police commissioner Jonathan Higgins.</p> <p>North-west Tasmania is known for its independent streak, an attitude that saw communities of shacks built without permission on public land and saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/12/indigenous-groups-decry-tasmania-off-road-vehicle-plan-this-is-destruction\">some locals drive around fences cutting off 4WD tracks.</a></p> <p>It\u2019s also one of the most vulnerable areas in the population, with an older population, high rates of chronic illness and lower levels of education. Up to two-thirds of the population receive at least one form of welfare payment, said Kons. Many do not have access to a computer or the internet.</p> <p>It\u2019s a community convinced of its isolation from the rest of the world \u2013 because the rest of the world does not often come knocking.</p> <p>Jacobson said there seems to have been an attitude, across a number of regional areas in Australia, that \u201cthis is a city virus\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMost of the media around it has been on very big outbreaks in New York and London, and there seems to perhaps have been a trend of country people not following the guidelines around social distancing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case in the north-west of Tasmania.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The children got Malory Towers. Now it\u2019s the grownups\u2019 turn. Just as the BBC\u2019s Enid Blyton adaptation was brought forward to keep the juvenile masses entertained when the schools shut early, so the corporation has pulled season three of Killing Eve (BBC Three) from its intended summer slot and placed it before us. Hopefully it can provide some welcome relief to the unique and uniquely wearing combination of panic and boredom that characterises life in lockdown.</p> <p>It will, I hope, not count as a spoiler if I say that Eve (Sandra Oh) is alive. She survived Villanelle\u2019s (Jodie Comer) bullet in Rome. Somehow the supreme assassin did not linger to see if she had done her job properly, or put an extra couple of bullets through her victim\u2019s head to make sure, meaning Eve is now back in England, working in the kitchen of a Korean restaurant and occasionally visiting her husband, Niko, who is in rehab.</p> <p>Villanelle is marrying a rich Spanish woman and inappropriately musing, as secret pseudo-lover killers will, about her ex during the wedding speech (\u201cI\u2019m so much happier now she\u2019s dead\u201d) before launching herself at an unexpected guest \u2013 her former trainer and handler Dasha (Harriet Walter). After a knockdown, drag-out fight between erstwhile mentor and mentee, Villanelle is restored to the assassin fold via the promise of being made a \u201ckeeper\u201d (management-level stuff, which promises to work out as well for the world\u2019s most dedicated and impatient loner as you might think) and sent out on another job to check her murderous skill set hasn\u2019t rusted since it was last exercised.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Carolyn (Fiona Shaw, whose character is given more emotional meat to chew on by the end of the first episode than she has had for the entire run so far) is being punished for her various unauthorised actions over the past series. A \u201cWhitehall warrior\u201d, Paul Bradville, has been given her office and most of her authority. He is played to perfection by Steve Pemberton, who specialises in people who make your hackles rise and your teeth itch as soon as they open their mouths.</p> <p>Carolyn\u2019s son, Kenny, is still living with her but has left MI6, disgusted and infuriated by the events of last season and his mother\u2019s hand in them, and is working as a journalist for a website called Bitter Pill. While you might be able to take the boy out of the intelligence services, the boy remains curious, and is continuing to investigate \u2013 to his ultimate detriment \u2013 the activities of The Twelve, who do not seem as chastened as you might hope. \u201cNow I\u2019m back,\u201d he says, when Carolyn recalls his \u201cdefection\u201d from his original post at MI6 for the Foreign Office. \u201cWith bells on!\u201d \u201cSo we can hear you coming,\u201d says Carolyn, because Carolyn gonna Carolyn til the end of time, and I, for one, will slavishly follow her until the scroll rolls up.</p> <p>And it\u2019s all fine. It\u2019s fun, with gasp-out-loud moments, and the series remains visually more appealing than almost anything else currently on screen. Comer is compelling, and with Eve in the aftermath of trauma, Oh gets the chance to add some depth to the detective. But there are fewer glorious flourishes so far, aesthetically, verbally or narratively. Even Villanelle\u2019s first job, though lauded as a triumphant improvement on a legendary hit by Dasha back in her own heyday, feels underpowered (though in fairness this may partly be in order to lull us into a false sense of complacency before the closing scenes back in London).</p> <p>Like the second series, it is still a high-quality, high-wire act, but it cannot quite match the verve and wit of Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s original episodes. A further burden now \u2013 and one shouldered by any subsequent series after one based on a cat-and-mouse premise \u2013 is that the artifice is showing. More and more elaborate ways must now be found to keep Eve and Villanelle apart, and other plotlines added to keep the central relationship from fulfilment and \u2013 given this one\u2019s essentially fatal nature \u2013 ending. So Killing Eve is becoming less dark, less knotty and more traditionally procedural, which feels like a sad loss even if what remains is still head and shoulders above the competition.</p> <p>Only a supreme cynic would wonder if its transfer from the summer slot to now, with a wholly captive audience, wasn\u2019t just a very welcome supplement to our viewing diets but also a useful boon for the programme itself.

  "<p>In this moment of global crisis \u2013 when all future plans have seemingly been upended and the fragility of life illuminated with terrible clarity \u2013 there is much solace to be found in focusing on the present moment; meeting each day, each hour, each meal as it comes. Yet, in Brian Greene\u2019s new book, <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/549600/until-the-end-of-time-by-brian-greene/\">Until the End of Time: Mind, Matter and </a><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/549600/until-the-end-of-time-by-brian-greene/\">Our Search</a><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/549600/until-the-end-of-time-by-brian-greene/\"> for Meaning in an Evolving Universe</a>, the theoretical physicist and author proposes that there is also a type of inner peace to be found by zooming out beyond this moment, this century, this millennium, back to the beginning of time and forward to the death of the universe.</p> <p>As well as offering lucid, detailed accounts of the science behind the big bang, the development of the cosmos, the emergence of life and human consciousness, and the inevitable extinction of the cosmos, Greene\u2019s treatise is motivated by a personal search for equanimity. I recently spoke with the Columbia University professor about the consolations of a scientific perspective when confronting existential angst.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/book/index.html?opinion-tint=false&amp;is-extract=false&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2020%2F04%2F06%2F9781524731670.jpg&amp;title=Until%20the%20End%20of%20Time&amp;author=Brian%20Greene&amp;publisher=Penguin%20Random%20House&amp;link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.penguinrandomhouse.com%2Fbooks%2F549600%2Funtil-the-end-of-time-by-brian-greene%2F\" data-alt=\"book\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/book/index.html?opinion-tint=false&is-extract=false&image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2020%2F04%2F06%2F9781524731670.jpg&title=Until%20the%20End%20of%20Time&author=Brian%20Greene&publisher=Penguin%20Random%20House&link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.penguinrandomhouse.com%2Fbooks%2F549600%2Funtil-the-end-of-time-by-brian-greene%2F\">book</a> </figure>  <p><strong>You begin Until the End of Time by letting us into a desire that motivated you for a long time, which you describe as wanting to \u201ccatch a glimpse of the transcendent</strong><strong>\u201d. Was this search with you from childhood?</strong></p> <p>Yes. And it came from an early recognition that we are not permanent, that we lead these finite lives, that we will all one day die. I think this realization hits kids in different ways. For me, it hit me in a sense where I wanted to be part of something that would be lasting, that would have a chance of being permanent.</p> <p><strong>Why did you turn to math to find the answer?</strong></p> <p>When I began to have this love of mathematics, it began to feel like this was the one thing in the world that you could really count on. Because once you prove a mathematical statement, it just is true forever, or so I thought.</p> <p><strong>If much of your life was characterized by a desire to find permanence and meaning in math and physics, you describe in this book a moment of realization that everything, including math, is impermanent. Was this a difficult realization?</strong></p> <p>Yes, absolutely. When I started using my understanding of physics to think about what the far future will be like, I began to realize everything, even mathematical truths, would at some level go away if there was no conscious being to reflect on them. And so that was a descent into darkness for me.</p> <p><strong>But then you turned a corner while writing this book?</strong></p> <p>Yes. In the very, very early stages of writing this book I just had this moment of clarity. Ultimately, I turned a sharp corner into a terrain that is very bright and very hopeful, which is the recognition of how utterly miraculous it is that we\u2019re here at all. How utterly stunning it is that collections of particles can coalesce into things that think and feel and can create wonder and beauty and figure out deep mysteries. It was a real emotional shift.\ufeff</p> <p><strong>A question you pose in the book is: what is the best way to describe existence and reality? As a physicist, you say it is ultimately with reference to the physical laws of our universe. Does that mean you\u2019re a reductionist?</strong></p> <p>I am, but that term needs to be defined appropriately. My view is that reductionism gives you the undergirding for the fundamental ingredients and laws that underlie every process in the universe. But that doesn\u2019t mean a reductionist framing is the right language for gaining insights into love and grief and aspiration and anxiety. Do I believe that those emotions and feelings reside upon the laws and the particles? I do. Do I think that the laws and particles provide the right language for deeply understanding those human qualities? I do not. We need to use the language that\u2019s relevant to the kinds of questions that interest us.</p> <p><strong>I enjoyed the chapter on the emergence of consciousness. As you make clear, the verdict is still out on what consciousness is, exactly. Do you have a preferred theory?</strong></p> <p>The one that really seems most convincing to me at the moment comes from Michael Graziano at Princeton. He basically says whenever we engage with the world, our brain makes a schematic model of what\u2019s happening in the world because it would burst at the seams if it had to include every single detail of everything that we encountered. So, we have these rough schematic models of everything that we encounter, including a rough schematic model of our own brain. Consciousness, he says, is nothing but the schematic representation that our brain holds of our own awareness.</p> <p><strong>A fascinating and equally terrifying idea in the book is that consciousness and thought itself will eventually become physically impossible. What does this mean, exactly?</strong></p> <p>The rough idea is that thought is itself a physical process that involves particles coursing through our brains. We know from the second law of thermodynamics that any physical process always generates a certain amount of heat, a certain amount of entropy, a certain amount of disorder. In the far future, the universe will not be able to absorb the heat produced by the very process of thought. So in that environment, any being that thinks one more thought will burn up in the entropic waste produced by the very process of thought itself. And at that point, thought will no longer be able to take place.</p> <p><strong>It is this idea that brings you, at the end of the book, to consider human life, and indeed all life, as something that will end. I\u2019m wondering how much room for doubt you leave, whether despite everything that human intelligence or any type of intelligence will prevail, nonetheless?</strong></p> <p>Do I have some doubt? I have doubt about everything. In order for me to make headway on understanding the far future, I rely upon today\u2019s laws of physics framed in the equations that we currently have at our disposal, and I allow for the possibility that in the far future those laws will change, and the math will change. And if things change sufficiently, then of course, I have left the possibility that the conclusions that I draw in the book would be affected.</p> <p>\ufeff</p> <p><strong>So obviously, we\u2019re in a time of discord and confusion and anxiety. What solace can people find in dwelling on these questions of eternity and the universe at a moment like this?</strong></p> <p>Watching the news and hearing what\u2019s happening and speaking to friends, I have that deep foreboding, I have that deep sense of tragedy that\u2019s looming and growing by the hour and it is deeply painful. At the same time, I find it useful to take a big step back and see all that we encounter within this larger cosmological story that does go from the big bang and sweeps through today and on to what we could call eternity. And within that larger sweep, I do gain a certain kind of calmness, I do gain a certain kind of a footing that I have difficulty achieving when I\u2019m solely focused on the moment to moment, the day to day.</p>",

Of course, the usefulness of this slightly hidebound allergy to compilation albums crumbles the further one travels from the core of the rock canon. Certainly, if you want to hear <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/grace-jones\">Grace Jones</a>, a singer who rose to international prominence in discotheques, soaring at the height of her powers, you need to understand how she ruled over discerning dance floors. It makes complete sense then, that a well-curated anthology (including extended, nightclub-facing mixes) would beat any studio record.</p> <p>This double album, complete with outtakes and hard-to-find single versions, provides an unbeatable introduction to the work she recorded during an imperial phase spanning 1980 to 1982, when she made the albums Warm Leatherette, Nightclubbing and Living My Life. The title takes its name from the Compass Point studios in the Bahamas, set up by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/audio/2009/may/22/island-record-chris-blackwell\">Chris Blackwell of Island Records</a> in 1977, which had a solid reputation from hosting such heavyweights as AC/DC, Judas Priest and U2. Beyond rock, it developed a fearsome parallel reputation for producing killer reggae-influenced pop and disco albums thanks to the incredible house band, the Compass Point All Stars, formed round the stellar core of Sly Dunbar, Robbie Shakespeare, Mikey Chung and Uziah \u201cSticky\u201d Thompson. Out of the many acts who worked with them, including Tom Tom Club and Black Uhuru, their work with Jones remains the peak achievement.</p> <p>Of course the real revelation on this compilation is Jones herself. Her initial tendency as a singer to drift slightly flat is replaced by a sublimely powerful voice that has accrued an incredible grain to complement and contrast her obvious polish. As great as the cherry-pickings of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Grace-Jones-Portfolio-Disco-Years/dp/B00RYGDNPM\">her disco trilogy</a> are, no one needs to hear her half-heartedly attending to Send in the Clowns or, God forbid, Tomorrow. Yet her covers of Warm Leatherette, She\u2019s Lost Control and Nightclubbing are desert island discs that mark her out as an incredible conceptualist as well as a performer.</p> <h2>The three albums to check out next</h2> <p><strong>Hurricane (2008)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc61C-VsTko\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Cc61C-VsTko?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://youtu.be/Cc61C-VsTko\">Grace Jones: Corporate Cannibal \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Few musicians celebrate their 60th birthday by making one of their best albums after almost two decades away from recording, but that\u2019s what Jones did with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/24/popandrock2\">Hurricane</a> in 2008. It\u2019s a vital piece of work that engaged with the post-trip-hop end of dubstep, the not inconsiderable legacy of Massive Attack and a hitherto unexplored familial connection with evangelical gospel song. Her radiation of a timeless vigour was reflected in the release of the reworked and remixed Hurricane Dub in 2011. Crucially, however, Hurricane displayed a clear link back to Warm Leatherette, not just in terms of sonic texture and groove, but also in the luxurious presence of the Compass Point All Stars.</p> <p><strong>Slave to the Rhythm (1985)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0XLzIswI2s\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z0XLzIswI2s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://youtu.be/Z0XLzIswI2s\">Grace Jones: Slave to the Rhythm \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>After finishing the Compass Point trilogy in 1982, Jones took a break from recording to concentrate on her acting career. She broke the three-year hiatus by embarking on a short but productive relationship with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/01/rocks-backpages-ztt\">ZTT</a>. A concept album of sorts, Slave to the Rhythm, is a collection of wildly different versions of the same song. As befits a project devised by Trevor Horn at the height of his pomp (initially for Frankie Goes to Hollywood, who rejected it), the album is a delightful synthesis of the sublime and the ridiculous. For example, opening track, Jones the Rhythm, features <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/apr/10/ian-mcshane-american-gods-interview-neil-gaiman-adaptation\">Ian McShane</a> (AKA TV\u2019s Lovejoy) giving a sonorous reading from Jungle Fever, the autobiography of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/aug/01/jean-paul-goude-best-photograph-grace-jones-nightclubbing\">Jean-Paul Goude</a>, the French photographer and designer.

Looking back now, we can see house music lurking just around the corner, whereas producer Nile Rodgers of Chic clearly couldn\u2019t. The booming chassis of gated reverb drums married to pristine, trebly rhythm funk guitar may have been slightly behind the curve when it landed in 1986, but now, decades after the fact, it just sounds superb. Jones had already proved herself a great songwriter on tracks such as Nipple to the Bottle, but here she got to push herself across the full album, ranging from the rampantly pumping I\u2019m Not Perfect (But I\u2019m Perfect for You) to the considered Victor Should Have Been a Jazz Musician.</p> <h2>One for the heads</h2> <p><strong>The Balearic Sound of Grace Jones</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8Jw6VvOh_8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/e8Jw6VvOh_8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8Jw6VvOh_8\">Grace Jones: La Vie en Rose (Tom Moulton mix) \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2018/may/17/grace-joness-greatest-looks-a-70th-birthday-celebration-in-pictures\">Grace Jones's greatest looks: a 70th-birthday celebration - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As befits someone with such deep roots in disco, Jones\u2019s back catalogue is studded with nuggets of DJ gold.

That is how we believe we can build a fairer, more just, more ecologically conscious world.</p> <p>The same should be the case for the selection of our leader.</p> <p>As a matter of basic democratic principle, the leader of the party should be selected by the members on the basis of one member one vote.

In fact, only by doing so are we likely to reach any kind of solid, lasting outcome.</p> <p>The 50:50 model adopted by the ALP and advocated for by our former leaders does not solve the problems either advocates of change or those opposed to change are seeking to deal with. It does not provide the truly democratic outcome many members crave; neither does it in fact provide an appropriate safeguard.</p> <p>In actuality, a 50:50 model entrenches oppositionality between members and their elected representatives. Instead of bringing us all together to make this vital decision, it risks driving us apart. It institutionalises a perceived separation between us.</p> <p>Perhaps most problematic, from a very pragmatic basis, are the deep implications for the Greens of a circumstance where the members vote for one candidate and the party room outvotes us in favour of another candidate with less movement support. Where this was manageable for the Labor Party, with its history of centralised control and party discipline, it could be a disaster for a truly grassroots party like the Greens. Our Party is our members. 50:50 disenfranchises members on whom we rely entirely for our campaign capacity. The party room outvoting the members on a matter as important as leadership effectively renders them silent and could jeopardise our ability to campaign.</p> <p>On the other hand, an open, inspiring contest of ideas between future leaders will excite our existing members, bring new people into the party, and create space for deeper public debate about politics.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/05/adam-bandt-is-well-placed-to-boost-the-greens-electoral-fortunes\">Adam Bandt is well-placed to boost the Greens\u2019 electoral fortunes | Paddy Manning</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A genuinely democratic process of one member one vote is one where we all have the same power in determining the leadership.

After being cooped up indoors for months, might we all take a renewed interest in the value of parks and urban green space, as well as the public infrastructure of toilets, drinking fountains and, crucially, hand-washing facilities?</p> <p>Much 19th-century public health theory may have been misguided, based on the evils of imaginary fumes, but it had beneficial outcomes nonetheless. Since the times of ancient Greece, it was widely thought that disease emanated from the earth and was spread through noxious vapours, or miasmas, that came from the soil.</p> <p>\u201cMiasma theory had a huge influence on cities, specifically building materials,\u201d says Christos Lynteris, a medical anthropologist at the University of St Andrews and co-author of <a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/Plague-and-the-City-1st-Edition/Engelmann-Henderson-Lynteris/p/book/9781138326125\">Plague and the City</a>. \u201cThe craze for paving streets with flagstones was largely driven by sanitarian logic and a desire to seal in the earth\u2019s poisonous gases.\u201d</p> <p>It was thought that disease could permeate through any structure in direct contact with the earth, so walls were sealed at the surface and buildings were increasingly coated, clad, plastered and varnished, forming an impregnable shield against this invisible enemy. Cracks were great causes of alarm \u2013 not only did they suggest structural fatigue, but also the possibility that deadly fumes might be released.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34b1356bcf874a58cf2fba17dd24726aeaf6f2db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34b1356bcf874a58cf2fba17dd24726aeaf6f2db/0_129_1783_1070/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Drastic measures \u2026 the botched attempt to burn Honolulu\u2019s stricken Chinatown in 1900.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Drastic measures \u2026 the botched attempt to burn Honolulu\u2019s stricken Chinatown in 1900.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FLHC 26/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lynteris\u2019s study of the third plague pandemic \u2013 outbreaks of which recurred around the world for several decades, killing more than 12 million people in all \u2013 reveals how the disease spawned drastic urban measures. \u201cBurning down parts of the city was one of the most popular solutions,\u201d he says, citing one extreme attempt in Honolulu in 1900. The plan was to raze an infected part of the city\u2019s Chinatown (a plan imbued with racial overtones), <a href=\"https://slate.com/human-interest/2014/08/history-of-the-cordon-sanitaire-honolulu-hawaii-bubonic-plague-in-1899.html\">but the fire ended up destroying most of the city</a> when the wind changed direction.</p> <p>Other countries experimented with burning down urban blocks to create <em>cordons sanitaires</em>, but once the rat was identified as the main carrier, all attention turned to safeguarding buildings against rodents. \u201cEvery city in the world suddenly had committees of engineers trying to devise ways of rat-proofing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a global craze, spawning thousands of patents in the 1910s and 20s, from drainpipe guards to concrete barriers.\u201d</p> <p>Lynteris is sceptical about how much coronavirus will actually change anything. \u201cEpidemics and pandemics have their own temporality,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are very condensed times, then panic dissipates very quickly and people rarely follow up.\u201d He points to the 2003 Sars outbreak, when it was discovered that one residential block in Hong Kong became a site of \u201csuper-spreading\u201d because of the way <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC539564/\">contaminated droplets from sewage pipes could enter people\u2019s bathrooms through dried-up U-bends in the drains</a>. Afterwards, there was no overhaul or mass-inspection of plumbing and ventilation systems to stop this happening again. \u201cA one-off pandemic usually has no impact at all,\u201d says Lynteris. \u201cIt has to keep coming back for us to take any notice.\u201d</p> <p>Some are using the current crisis to take a step back and reassess fundamental assumptions about how cities are structured. \u201cThis is the best time ever to think of a walkable city,\u201d says Wouter Vanstiphout, professor of design as politics at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. \u201cCould coronavirus be a catalyst for decentralisation? We have these enormous hospitals and people living on top of each other, but still having to travel long distances across the city to get to them. The pandemic suggests we should distribute smaller units such as hospitals and schools across more of the urban tissue and strengthen local centres.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f134749fa678e8b96c0d4a7c7cc1e92067e563c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f134749fa678e8b96c0d4a7c7cc1e92067e563c/0_800_4123_2474/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Personal space \u2026 open-plan offices may become a thing of the past.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Personal space \u2026 open-plan offices may become a thing of the past.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lester Lefkowitz/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With travel limited, the local high street has come into its own: corner shops and bodegas are generally proving much better stocked than supermarkets.

There is no neighbourhood. There is no city. If you subtract the tourists, there is nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Coronavirus has exposed the effects of tourism and migration on cities across the world in different ways. In Delhi, the decree to stay at home has seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/india-wracked-by-greatest-exodus-since-partition-due-to-coronavirus\">thousands of migrant workers walk hundreds of miles back to their rural villages</a>, with cancelled work leaving them unable to pay rent.</p> <p>\u201cI think that \u2018global cities\u2019 boosterism will take some blows,\u201d says Vanstiphout. \u201cMuch has been made of this fluid network of metropolitan areas, but there is now more of a sense of the city as a place of safety, a place of home and continuity. This whole thing could be taken as warning against migration, but to me it\u2019s the opposite. It\u2019s a warning against tourism and the inequality that causes labour migration on a temporary basis; a warning against the gig economy and the devastation of public services. There is something really clarifying about a pandemic: you can see the absolute necessity of a public health service and a proper social welfare system. It creates a very clear picture of what is good.\u201d</p>",

It doesn\u2019t matter how either of us got here or what you call it, it\u2019s painfully difficult just the same.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>At least living under house arrest and two 10-year stints in prison prophetically prepared me for worldwide lockdown</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In prison, I found myself believing that walls were all that existed. They stood unsympathetic to my suffering and closed in a little bit more each day. I simply refused to make peace with them. I resisted, pounding and screaming into their flat, cold, cement faces. I often thought that I would lose my mind from the feeling of slowly being entombed and cut off from the world, but then something happened.</p> <p>As the outside world disappeared, a new one took shape. The inner world within myself surfaced, as if it had always been waiting to do so. The most important lesson I learned during this time was that I had to accept my circumstances as they were, then change my perspective about them. To my surprise when I did this, those once menacing walls, with their obscene graffiti and chipped paint, transformed. They were no longer holding me hostage but offering refuge.</p> <p>Restrictions and stay-at-home orders are the reality, but if we can shift our perspective, our homes become sanctuaries, not prisons. We are not locked in but rather the threat of disease, and hundreds of other harmful things are locked out, distractions and misaligned priorities among them.</p> <p>Solitude challenges you to look at things differently. Before prison, my worldview had been rather limited and selfish. I was known to throw terrible tantrums as I tried to bend reality to my will, but peace depended on my bending to reality. Life wasn\u2019t all about me. I had to learn what was within my control and what wasn\u2019t. I also discovered that time exists in relation to an emotion or experience, and it slowed or sped according to my ability to be present. So, I learned how to flow with it, not rushing nor procrastinating, but fully engaged in whatever was before me.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Freedom was finally within my reach when the walls threatened to close in on me again</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What did that look like? It was as simple as just paying attention. I read books carefully. I listened to others deeply. I stopped mindlessly flipping through the channels of my mind. I gave my full attention to every activity, no matter how small it might be. Full engagement strengthened my gratitude, and gratitude strengthened my will.</p> <p>Just a few weeks ago I was told that the parole board had approved the removal of my GPS ankle monitor. After hearing the news, I celebrated by making plans to visit friends in Dallas and Austin. I allowed myself to dream again about better jobs, better places to live and a thriving social life. Freedom was finally within my reach when the walls threatened to close in on me again.</p> <p>Now I\u2019m staring out the window and dreading another confinement. Earlier in the week I had spoken to my brother about the unfairness of it all. \u201cWhy is this happening now?! Just when I\u2019m free of the monitor, just when I got my life back together, the whole world goes on lockdown.\u201d He laughed: \u201cBaby sister, the whole world isn\u2019t conspiring against you. A pandemic is not happening just to interrupt your plans.\u201d I smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re right, life isn\u2019t all about me.\u201d After we hung up, I paced the floor as I often would in my cell. I ran my hands over the walls of my small apartment and knew they would either transform into a prison cell or a refuge. I decided that a refuge sounds nice right about now.</p>",
  "<p>There\u2019s been plenty of conversation about all the ways this pandemic has laid bare the brokenness of our systems: 27.5 million Americans without health insurance, the massive gaps in public health and healthcare funding, the two in five of us who couldn\u2019t come up with $400 in an emergency.</p> <p>To many of us, none of this feels shocking \u2013 we\u2019ve been grappling with the depth and breadth of America\u2019s systemic failures for years.

In New York, people of a certain class are escaping to their country houses. <em>Secret money</em>, a friend of mine calls this, when acquaintances who complain along with you about the difficulty of making it in a certain profession or paying rent in New York City, and then you find out they have an extra house and their kids go to private school. But also, in my experience these last few weeks, this pandemic has exposed the privileges that some of us still have, regardless of how broke we are.</p> <p>In addition to being under 40 and without any underlying health conditions, in addition to our educations and my ability to work from home, we have access to my husband\u2019s brother\u2019s wife\u2019s family\u2019s New Jersey country house right now. I keep saying all those things \u2013 husband, brother, wife \u2013 to people when I tell them that we left the city to prove, I guess, that we\u2019re not one of those families who have secret country houses of our own.</p> <p>I have been embarrassed by this access, in the same way I\u2019m embarrassed to have parents who have money, which is to say, I find people having things that they did not earn, or people having so much more than most, to be sort of abhorrent without always knowing why I feel that way. Privilege is abhorrent, I think, because of how fundamentally skewed and unfair its allocation always is.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-finances-working-poverty-us\">Coronavirus: a financial emergency that turns treading water into drowning</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My husband\u2019s brother and his family also live in the city but left before we did last month. They also have small kids and are trying to work. They also lost a lot of income when everything shut down, and none of us is sure how we\u2019ll survive as this unfolds. We\u2019re all trying to find ways to make our lives work in the same ways we\u2019ve always tried to make our lives work, which is to say, on the margins, patching things together, with the help of friends and family, with kids in the background always somewhere needing things. We\u2019re taking turns parenting and cooking. We know there is a risk in coming together, more bodies and more chances of infection, but we\u2019re not leaving the property except one of us every other week for groceries. Whether or not this is the right call, we\u2019ve decided that it\u2019s worth the risk.</p> <p>A couple of days before we left, we\u2019d taken the children for a walk, and, angry at me over something, our seven-year-old had threatened to lick all the fences that we passed to make me mad. It\u2019s a relief now to take the kids outside without telling them that they can\u2019t touch anything, to have more inside space for them to do their remote learning and for them to play.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Our luck is only further to the point of how completely unfair, uneven and arbitrary survival feels in this moment</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The day we left the city, I kept asking my husband if he felt guilty. <em>Of course,</em> he said. <em>But I\u2019m also just so scared.</em> It felt like we were abandoning our city, our friends. This weekend I got two phone calls about two friends losing loved ones to this virus. Four friends have been laid off and three others have been furloughed. People are losing jobs and houses, taking the subway to work still, unable to feed themselves or their kids. Every day we\u2019re here I feel guilty, but also, every day, I feel a little bit less scared.</p> <p>Of course, none of this wipes the other worries. There is still the rent for our apartment, my husband is now filing for unemployment; there are still grocery trips. I worry that the ends will never meet again for us after this crisis. I worry that we might have to leave the city and move in with my husband\u2019s family in Florida, that I might lose my various jobs as a result. But worry has a different shape, I guess, when you know for sure that the problem is too big for you to fix it. When the problem is so obviously less consequential than all the loss that you see all around.</p> <p>For a while I thought this essay was about gratitude. I am grateful. I wake up every morning both numbed and bolstered by how lucky our family has been so far. But our luck is only further to the point of how completely unfair, uneven and arbitrary survival feels in this present moment. I hope more of us realize that, for many people in this country, it has always been like that.</p>",
  "<p>Goldie Hawn is Hollywood royalty, but that\u2019s not how she sees it. Sure, she won an Oscar at 24, for her role starring opposite Ingrid Bergman and Walter Matthau in 1969\u2019s screwball comedy Cactus Flower, and was a box-office favourite for much of the 1970s, 80s and 90s. The ultimate tongue-in-cheek ditzy blonde expanded successfully into producing, too, with movies such as Private Benjamin and Overboard. Kurt Russell, her co-star in the latter, has been her partner for 37 years. And yet, she says: \u201cI consider myself more a dancer than anything else.\u201d</p> <p>Her mother was a dance teacher and, pre-fame, Hawn performed as a ballerina and go-go dancer before being spotted on a can-can line in Los Angeles and drafted into TV comedy. She go-go danced on TV, too, barefoot in a bikini, with graffiti all over her body. Even now, at 74, she posts compelling <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B9VVuV0nHXo/\">videos of herself dancing around her home</a> with an almost childlike lack of self-consciousness.</p> <p>While she natters to me on the phone (like a \u201cmotor machine\u201d, in her own words) for more than an hour about fame, meditation, navigating the patriarchy and knowing when to call it a day, I picture her in the gorgeous Brentwood home you glimpse on Instagram, a bone broth bubbling away in the kitchen.</p> <p>Hawn sees dancing as a metaphor. \u201cWhen I talk about dancing through life,\u201d she says, \u201cit really is how we move. It\u2019s how we face today, how we walk into a room, how we pull ourselves up and feel that what we have inside of us is valuable and important.\u201d In those videos, she says, she is experiencing \u201cabandonment, and also fearlessness. If you can express yourself without being afraid of looking silly \u2013 dance like nobody\u2019s watching, right? \u2013 I think that is a beautiful thing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e09af669a81625f1457daa70c2361d6b28d1a13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e09af669a81625f1457daa70c2361d6b28d1a13/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Goldie Hawn at Jefferson elementary school in Redondo Beach, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Goldie Hawn visiting Jefferson elementary school in Redondo Beach, California as part of her work with Mind Up.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Given Hawn\u2019s passion for wellbeing, you might have expected her to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/30/nhs-chief-simon-stevens-condemns-gwyneth-paltrow-wellness-products\">a Goop-like lifestyle brand</a>. Instead, in 2003 she teamed up with academics working in psychology, neuroscience and education and launched Mind Up \u2013 <a href=\"https://mindup.org/\">a simple and fun curriculum for mindful learning</a>, now used around the world and in 250 schools in the UK and Ireland alone.</p> <p>Hawn\u2019s big idea was that pupils would learn about their brains and emotions, and how to calm and regulate them, with thrice-daily \u201cbrain breaks\u201d \u2013 five-minute mindfulness meditations \u2013 and other proven positive psychological tactics such as keeping gratitude journals. To help children get through the Covid-19 pandemic, Hawn has recorded a guided brain break, and made it available for free on the <a href=\"https://www.moshisleep.com/\">Moshi: Sleep and Mindfulness app</a> and via the Mind Up website. I\u2019ve tried it with my kids and can confirm that it\u2019s equally relaxing for adults.</p> <p>By the early 70s, Hawn was a household name, thanks to that Oscar and her regular appearances on the sketch show Rowan and Martin\u2019s Laugh-In. \u201cIt was a very strange ride, a quick rise to stardom. I was unsettled. I didn\u2019t know where I was going. I went to the psychologist when I was 21 and I continued for about eight years to try to understand more about my mind, my psyche, how I could return back to my sense of joy.\u201d</p> <p>When she was 26, in 1972, she recalls, \u201cmeditation was really happening. You know, the Beatles were meditating.\u201d She was initiated at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/apr/08/transcendental-meditation-depression\">Transcendental Meditation centre</a> and given a mantra, as is the custom, to be repeated silently and never shared. \u201cThe more important thing is not what the title is on it, because meditation is just the way you train your brain to quiet down and so forth,\u201d says Hawn. \u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of names for it now. But my experience was visceral, it was amazing. I rediscovered something in that one sitting. I can\u2019t explain the joy that was brought back to me. It was a transformational \u2018Aha!\u2019 moment for me. It stabilised my mind and gave me a piece of my interior that was all mine. No one could touch it. It was my internal universe and it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been doing ever since.\u201d</p> <p>She had a head start, in a way. \u201cStarting out as a dancer gave me an aspect of mindfulness that I didn\u2019t even realise that I was getting,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause to dance is to be aware of every piece of your body while you\u2019re moving. It\u2019s like a meditation unto itself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"175f0a7dcdb17326b5543fc29eff08fecbccbc15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/175f0a7dcdb17326b5543fc29eff08fecbccbc15/0_0_2534_3168/800.jpg\" alt=\"Hawn with Kurt Russell in 2018.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hawn with Kurt Russell in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MediaPunch/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 70s were hectic, with more films including Shampoo, with Warren Beatty, Julie Christie and Carrie Fisher, and There\u2019s a Girl in My Soup with Peter Sellers. After divorcing her first husband, the dancer and director Gus Trikonis, in 1976, she married the musician Bill Hudson, with whom she had a son, Oliver, and a daughter, Kate. Hawn and Hudson divorced in 1982, the year before she and Russell became an item. Russell also had a son, and they went on to have another together, Wyatt, in 1986.</p> <p>For Hawn, the 80s were \u201ca great period of abandonment, great music, great fun. A lot of the movies that we made then were feelgood movies. They don\u2019t make them much any more.\u201d This makes her sad because they were not only \u201cvery, very, very funny, but they were also really about something. I produced a lot of movies, and I was always interested in the situations that women had to deal with.\u201d</p> <p>Playing a woman as a fish out of water in a macho role, and ultimately doing it better than the men, excited her, whether it was a soldier in Private Benjamin (for which she was nominated for another Oscar) or an American football coach in Wildcats (1986), in which Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson made their screen debuts.</p> <p>\u201cWomen were my obvious focus,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause it is not always easy having power and being female,\u201d That was true off screen as well as on. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it was. It wasn\u2019t that all men were terrible or that the situation was unbearable. It was a cultural problem.\u201d</p> <p>She believes the #MeToo movement is making headway, \u201cbut back then we had to make our way around the patriarchal society, how men, the culture and the world, looked at women. A lot of it could be sleazy. I went through that. A lot of it could be: \u2018You\u2019re powerful now; who do you think you are?\u2019 Some of it is stopping women from doing the things they want to do, and in relationships, making women feel bad about themselves.\u201d</p> <p>The 90s were kind to Hawn, with the First Wives Club in 1996, also starring Bette Midler and Diane Keaton, a highlight. \u201cOur job is a brilliant one, and continues to be,\u201d she says. She has just played Mrs Claus opposite Russell\u2019s Santa for a Netflix special for next Christmas. But after she hit her 50s, she didn\u2019t make a film for 15 years. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to wait for a phone to ring. And I certainly wasn\u2019t going to continue to produce, because I produced for like 25 years and I didn\u2019t want to do that any more. I\u2019d done it, I did it, it was done. Great, but now it\u2019s time to move on.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8896ceee9c274cc6b81ed7d8c7a11a6d384d7441\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8896ceee9c274cc6b81ed7d8c7a11a6d384d7441/0_0_2486_1802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hawn with Amy Schumer in Snatched.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"725\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hawn with Amy Schumer in Snatched.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justina Mintz/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMy interests are vast,\u201d she says, \u201cand I\u2019m fascinated with the human condition, spirituality and religiosity.\u201d She started research for a TV documentary on happiness, with a focus on the brain, and was staggered by the high suicide rates among young people. \u201cChildren were taking more pills and psychotropics. Oh my God, what happened to childhood?\u201d She wistfully recalls her own youth of unlocked doors, lying about with friends searching for pictures in clouds or cracking rocks open. \u201cWe cleaned them, put them in the sun and looked at how beautiful they were. But our children are now online, looking at things that their brains are not developed enough to understand.\u201d</p> <p>In 2001, 9/11 ushered in a period of fear and sadness. Hawn promptly ditched the documentary idea and \u201cturned vigilante\u201d, she says, redirecting all that she had learned about the brain into the idea for Mind Up.</p> <p>It took 18 months to create the programme, \u201cwith scientists, positive psychiatrists, trainers, teachers \u2013 it was absolutely thrilling\u201d. Hawn and Russell had relocated to Vancouver, so that Wyatt could pursue his hockey-playing dream, and she started working with academics at the University of British Columbia, to research and demonstrate the positive effects of the curriculum, which is aimed at children from preschool to about 13 years old.</p> <p>The results, she says, were stellar. \u201cThese children had changed in a matter of four months, and had a whole new way of being. They understood their emotional systems in the brain, that the hippocampus is where they remember, the amygdala, which is fight-or-flight.\u201d They learned how strong emotions can overtake the prefrontal cortex and cloud rational thinking. \u201cWe have to know that we have to calm down so we can make great decisions,\u201d says Hawn. The Mind Up children \u201chave control over their own minds, their fear. They know what to do, to breathe and focus and do a brain break.\u201d</p> <p>Other than taking regular brain breaks, Hawn\u2019s tips for staying positive in lockdown include carrying out acts of kindness, and \u201cbefore you go to bed, think of three things that went well today. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s a little crazy thing \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d And of course there\u2019s dancing. \u201cTake some music you love and if you can\u2019t dance, go do 10 minutes of jumping jacks. Get yourself all cheered up.\u201d</p> <p>She says that after she gets off the phone with me, \u201cI\u2019m not going to look at my phone and I\u2019m going to go directly for a hike in my neighborhood. I do about three or four miles.\u201d Then she will come home and pump some iron.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06f43562f6cfb64a8d624a0108900d9245f1425c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06f43562f6cfb64a8d624a0108900d9245f1425c/0_186_3280_1968/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hawn in Private Benjamin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hawn in Private Benjamin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reese Witherspoon has <a href=\"https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/reese-witherspoon-calls-goldie-hawn-diane-keaton-her-heroes/\">described Hawn as one of her all-time heroes</a>, because she has always been known for being a funny and smart woman in Hollywood.

This infuriated Vu\u010di\u0107 and led to an emotional outburst.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c74d0136817009bf519e0dd2701123346f5f101d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c74d0136817009bf519e0dd2701123346f5f101d/0_291_4500_2701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A group of Chinese doctors inspect a makeshift hospital for coronavirus patients at the Belgrade Fair.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A group of Chinese doctors inspect a makeshift hospital for coronavirus patients at the Belgrade Fair.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oliver Bunic/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cEuropean solidarity does not exist. It was a fairy tale. I have sent a special letter to the only ones who can help. That is China,\u201d Vu\u010di\u0107 told the nation. He asked China for supplies, equipment and advice on fighting the pandemic, and soon after, a plane landed in Belgrade.</p> <p>\u201cIt was not exactly what we would want to hear from a government that claims it is doing its utmost to join the EU,\u201d said one European diplomat based in Belgrade. But even in Spain and Italy there has been anger at the lack of a coordinated European response to coronavirus, and for those outside the bloc like Serbia, the rejection was felt even more strongly.</p> <p>\u201cThe EU was initially a bit slow and clumsy. This is what happens very often with the EU, of course it cannot be as fast and interventionist in the way China or Russia can be,\u201d said Milena Lazarevi\u0107 of the European Policy Centre in Belgrade.</p> <p>China was happy to step into the gap. Serbian officials say the Chinese experts, who have remained in the country, are now running the government\u2019s coronavirus policy. Unlike most of Europe, Serbia is following the Chinese model of isolating even mild cases of coronavirus in large field hospitals, rather than trusting people to self-isolate.</p> <p>The Chinese also recommended an absolute lockdown such as the one that had been implemented in Wuhan, said one Serbian official. This was rejected on the basis that the Serbian public would not accept it, but strict curfews have been put in place, and those over 70 are confined to their homes at all times.</p> <p>A promised mass-testing regime is not yet up to speed and <a href=\"https://balkaninsight.com/2020/04/08/the-torture-of-a-coronavirus-test-in-serbia/\">reports</a> suggest the testing procedure is chaotic. But Serbian officials are hopeful that implementing the strict Chinese measures early will mean the country avoids a large-scale epidemic as seen in western European countries. As of Sunday, Serbia has 3,380 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 74 deaths.</p> <p>Russia also sent aid, mainly disinfectant solution for hospitals and apartment block entrances. Back in Moscow, opposition figures have griped that the Kremlin has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/coronavirus-russia-sends-plane-full-of-medical-supplies-to-us\">been sending equipment</a> abroad for propaganda gain, while doctors at home lack basic supplies. In Serbia, the help was welcome, though there was a sense that the fanfare around the deliveries may outweigh their actual use.</p> <p>Since Vu\u010di\u0107\u2019s outburst, the EU has also been working hard to showcase the ways in which it has helped Serbia. The EU delegation in the country <a href=\"http://europa.rs/eu-assistance-to-health-sector-in-serbia-a-fundamental-effort-that-modernised-the-whole-serbian-health-system/?lang=en\">noted</a> that more than \u20ac200m (\u00a3176m) of grants and \u20ac250m of loans have been provided to help build and equip medical facilities over the past two decades. An EU-funded laboratory, initially designed to do quality control tests for milk and other food products, has been repurposed as a coronavirus testing lab. A further \u20ac93m of funds has been pledged by the EU over the short and medium term to fight coronavirus and its effects.</p> <p>The coronavirus situation is in many ways an extension of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/17/putin-attacks-west-role-in-balkans-ahead-of-lavish-serbia-visit\">previous battle</a> for hearts and minds in the Serbia. A <a href=\"https://www.mei.gov.rs/upload/documents/nacionalna_dokumenta/istrazivanja_javnog_mnjenja/opinion_pool_dec_19.pdf\">survey</a> carried out last December showed that many Serbs believed Russia or China to be the country\u2019s largest donor over the past two decades, while in fact the EU had given about 100 times more than either.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn times of crisis, a plane with emergency materials may have a big public effect but the structural work in the health sector for many years is easily forgotten,\u201d said the European diplomat.</p> <p>Vu\u010di\u0107 has since also praised European aid, but the big Chinese gestures are likely to stick in the public memory. The prime minister, Ana Brnabi\u0107, has said she wants to build a monument to Serbian-Chinese friendship when the pandemic is over, while a billboard in Belgrade, paid for by a pro-government tabloid, has a simple message: \u201cThank you, Brother Xi.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s a tad bit convoluted to explain, although it\u2019s rather easy to follow once the game is in progress. </p> <p>For the purpose of this tournament, players will be facing each other one-on-one. The first player (decided by a coin flip, in this particular instance) literally calls the shot: they specify a particular shot that they will attempt. Should they make it, the other player has to make the same shot. If that player fails, they get a letter starting with H (followed by O and then an R and then a\u2026 well I think you get the picture). Then it\u2019s that player\u2019s turn to challenge the other. A player is eliminated on the fifth shot they fail to pull off.</p> <p><strong>So the goal for each player is NOT to spell H-O-R-S-E?<br></strong></p> <p>Correct. Reverse \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d rules.</p> <p><strong>Why a horse? Why not a chicken?</strong></p> <p>It turns out that the origin of \u201cH-O-R-S-E\u201d is a nearly impossible thing to google. (I did find some interesting things about evolution, so it\u2019s not a total wash.) Maybe it was just the optimal number of letters, as there\u2019s a shorter version called P-I-G.</p> <p><strong>Wait, doesn\u2019t this means that there\u2019s no time limit here?</strong></p> <p>Yes, although this is scheduled to be a two-hour event, how long we\u2019re actually here depends on how good the players are at making shots. (Spoilers: they are very, very good.) If this does last a long time, it\u2019s probably a good thing. The more competitive tonight\u2019s tournament is, the more entertaining it will likely be. Plus, hey, there hasn\u2019t been basketball in a month, so in my book the longer this goes, the better.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e9387048f082dfd549d5338\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-12T22:20:04.295Z\">11.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Oh hey look, it\u2019s an actual sporting event! </p> <p>As you\u2019ve probably heard, pretty much the entire U.S. has been shut down for the last month. In fact, the NBA deserves at least parital credit in helping the country realize just how serious the coronavirus pandemic was about to become. After Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19, Adam Silver made the quick decision to immediately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/12/nba-suspends-season-covid-19-coronavirus-basketball\">shut down the league indefinitely</a>. It was a bold move, and the other sports leagues followed suit.</p> <p>Here we are a month later and a healthy percentage of the country is under quarantine. Ironically, we\u2019ve never needed the distraction of live sports more. There are only so many episodes of \u201cTiger King\u201d to binge, after all. Thankfully, ESPN and the NBA managed to figure out a way to put together a vaguely sports-related competition without, you know, putting huge groups of people at risk. While team basketball, even in an empty arena, is a no-go, H-O-R-S-E is turn based. This means, players can compete with each other without violating social distancing guidelines. </p> <p>ESPN, which has been desperate for content over the last few weeks for obvious reasons, plans to make the most out of this tournament. Today is merely the first round and we won\u2019t crown a winner until the remaining two rounds play out on Thursday.<br></p> <p>The good thing about social distancing is that it doesn\u2019t affect your ability to communicate with us.

years sub-Saharan Africa is about to go into recession, according to World Bank estimates.</p> <p>Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s two biggest economies, South Africa and Nigeria are heading for deep recessions, it said, as demand drops from developed nations for raw materials such as oil and precious metals.</p> <p>The same goes for Angola, Africa\u2019s second biggest oil exporter.</p> <p>Oil prices have fallen to between $20 and $30 a barrel, nearing the cost of production in Nigeria.</p> <p>Following 2.4% growth last year, the estimate for sub-Saharan Africa 2020 is between -2.1 and -5.1 % as the economy contracts.</p> <p>This is in part a knock-on effect from the economic hits being taken by Africa\u2019s main trading partners: China, the EU and the United States.</p> <p>Add to that the slump in the key markets of raw materials and tourism as well as the effect of measures to confine populations at home and you have the perfect economic storm for the continent.</p> <p>The African Development Bank remains less pessimistic but still sees a fall into recession of between -0.7 and -2.8 %.</p> <p>The African Union estimates that around 20m jobs, in formal and informal sectors, are under threat.<br></p> <p>The United Nations puts the figure much higher, at up to 50m.</p> <p>High unemployment and economic slowdown are also hitting African workers abroad, and therefore their money transfers back home, which are often a vital part of the economy.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e92b7668f08db3109f20f8a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p

British aid minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan said assisting the poorest nations now would help prevent the virus returning to the United Kingdom. </p> <p>Britain has reported almost 10,000 deaths from the coronavirus so far, the fifth highest national number globally. </p> <p>\u201cWhile our brilliant doctors and nurses fight coronavirus at home, we\u2019re deploying British expertise and funding
