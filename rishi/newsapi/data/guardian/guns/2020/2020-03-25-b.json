  "<p>The Australian man charged with murdering 51 people in two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, has suddenly changed his plea to admit all charges at a hastily arranged court appearance.</p> <p>On 15 March last year, a man dressed in military fatigues and armed with semi-automatic weapons shot dead 51 worshippers at Al Noor and Linwood mosques in inner-city Christchurch. Forty-nine people were also injured in the attacks, which were livestreamed on the internet.</p> <p>The horrific attack shocked New Zealand and is regarded as the worst massacre in the country\u2019s modern history, as well as the country\u2019s largest ever criminal prosecution.</p> <p>The man accused of the shootings, Brenton Tarrant, a former gym instructor from Australia, was charged with the murders and had maintained a not-guilty plea throughout. His trial was set down for the 2 June in Christchurch high court.</p> <p>This has now been called off and he has been convicted of all charges, with sentencing to occur later this year.</p> <p>On Thursday in a court appearance arranged at short notice, the details of which were known to few, Tarrant had changed his plea, and is now pleading guilty to all charges; 51 of murder, 40 of attempted murder and one charge under the Terrorism Suppression act.</p> <p>Tarrant did not appear in the courtroom but changed his plea via video link from his Auckland prison cell. It came on the first day New Zealand went into nationwide lockdown in an attempt to control the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Prime minister Jacinda Ardern said the guilty plea would be a \u201crelief\u201d for families.</p> <p>\u201cThe guilty plea today will provide some relief to the many people whose lives were shattered by what happened on March 15,\u201d Ardern said.</p> <p>\u201cThese guilty pleas and conviction bring accountability for what happened and also save the families who lost loved ones, those who were injured, and other witnesses, the ordeal of a trial.</p> <p>The change of plea came as a shock for Kiwis, most of whom were in lockdown in their own homes, police commissioner Mike Bush said.</p> <p>\u201cArrangements for the court hearing were made at short notice after the defendant indicated, via his counsel on Tuesday afternoon, that he wished to be brought before the court,\u201d Bush said in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cPolice appreciate this news will come as a surprise to the victims and the public, some of whom may have wished to be present in the courtroom.\u201d</p> <p>Bush said the two imams from Al Noor and Linwood Avenue mosques attended as representatives of the victims, and suppression orders were put in place to allow as many victims as possible to be told of the guilty plea before it was released to the public.</p> <p>Families of the bereaved and victims who spoke to the Guardian said they had not even known that a hearing for Tarrant was planned for Thursday.</p> <p>\u201cThe news is fresh and I don\u2019t know whether to believe it or not,\u201d said Maysoon Salama. Her son, Atta Elayyan, was killed and her husband was badly injured in the attack. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable really.\u201d But she was relieved \u201cin a way\u201d, she said.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been a lot emotionally up and down for us,\u201d she said, adding that the gunman had treated the court system \u201clike a game\u201d, further distressing families.</p> <p>She had not been aware that a hearing was taking place, and said the Muslim community had been preoccupied with the four-week national lockdown that began in New Zealand at midnight to tackle Covid-19.</p> <p>News media were told of the court appearance on Wednesday but were not told what it would be about, and notice of the hearing came just hours before the Covid-19 lockdown began.</p> <p>Salama said the bereaved and victims had received a phone call from a lawyer representing them after the hearing, but before the news was made public.</p> <p>Bush said 15 March had changed New Zealand forever. \u201cI want to acknowledge the victims, their families and the community of Christchurch \u2013 the many lives that were changed forever,\u201d Bush said. \u201cThey have inspired all of us to be a kind and more tolerant community.\u201d</p> <p>Sentencing will not take place until it is possible for all victims who wish to attend the hearing to do so, police said, and that will not be possible \u201cfor some time\u201d due to the Covid-19 epidemic.</p> <p>Tarrant has been remanded in custody until 1 May 2020.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 April 2020. An earlier version incorrectly described Tarrant as being armed with \u201cautomatic weapons\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump isn\u2019t much of a doctor or scientist. He isn\u2019t much of a diplomat or general. His leadership skills match his business skills. There\u2019s a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2016/live-updates/general-election/real-time-fact-checking-and-analysis-of-the-first-presidential-debate/fact-check-has-trump-declared-bankruptcy-four-or-six-times/\">reason</a> his companies went bankrupt so many times.</p> <p>But he might just be a pioneer with this idea of letting people die for the sake of the country. Only a once-in-a-century leader has the guts to say out loud what the worst among us are really thinking: everyone other than me is expendable.</p> <p>Anyone older is past it, for sure. The younger ones we can easily afford to lose: they don\u2019t actually pay for anything. The smarter ones? Totally annoying. The dumber ones: what\u2019s even the point?</p> <p>The sick are a real drain on us, financially and emotionally. The poor won\u2019t really do much in the long run, no matter how hard we try. The wealthy just keep shoving it in your face. Foreigners aren\u2019t like us at all. And our neighbors are frankly a bit too close for comfort.</p> <p>So when you add it all up, it\u2019s only sensible that we ask everyone else to sacrifice themselves for us. For the sake of the nation and all that\u2019s good, please just go, so that the rest of us \u2013 not counting the undesirables \u2013 can get back to our old lives.</p> <p>\u201cLook, you\u2019re going to lose a number of people to the flu,\u201d this pandemic of a president told Fox News on Tuesday. \u201cBut you\u2019re going to lose more people by putting a country into a massive recession or depression. You\u2019re going to lose people. You\u2019re going to have suicides by the thousands. You\u2019re going to have all sorts of things happen. You\u2019re going to have instability.\u201d</p> <p>Mr President, it might come as a shock to you but we are currently suffering from a viral case of instability, and you are one of its hotspots. As you surely recall, if you lift all restrictions, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/coronavirus-fatality-rate-white-house.html\">estimated</a> death count is 2.2 million Americans.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just come in and say, \u2018Let\u2019s close up the United States of America,\u2019\u201d continued the president who prides himself on closing the borders of, um, the United States of America.</p> <p>Being a fundamentally religious man, albeit one with a love of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-cohen/fbi-documents-point-to-trump-role-in-hush-money-for-porn-star-daniels-idUSKCN1UD18D\">paying off</a> porn stars, Trump has a full resurrection in mind for the country in all of two weeks. \u201cI would love to have it open by Easter,\u201d he told the normally diligent hoax-busters at Fox News. \u201cI will, I will tell you that right now. I would love to have that. It\u2019s such an important day for other reasons, but I\u2019ll make it an important day for this too.\u201d</p> <p>Pray tell: what are those other reasons that Easter is important? Perhaps if we could discuss those reasons, you might rethink this one. It seems \u2013 how to put this diplomatically? \u2013 a little perverse to kill large swaths of the population to celebrate Jesus Christ rising from the dead. The White House comms team might think it\u2019s confusing to mix one message of rebirth with another about mass death.</p> <p>Of course, this kind of party-pooping epidemiology is so typical of the elites. They just don\u2019t get it. Or worse: they\u2019re trying to save lives just so they can hurt Donald Trump\u2019s re-election.</p> <p>\u201cThe LameStream Media is the dominant force in trying to get me to keep our Country closed as long as possible in the hope that it will be detrimental to my election success,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1242905328209080331\">tweeted</a> our LameStream President on Wednesday. \u201cThe real people want to get back to work ASAP. We will be stronger than ever before!\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If it\u2019s not the media\u2019s fault, it\u2019s the doctors and scientists, or the governors or the Chinese. Someone, anyone, not called Trump</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The real people won\u2019t be surprised to hear that our fearful leader\u2019s latest gambit is to blame everyone else as he desperately tries to squirm his way to November\u2019s election. How else can he divert attention from his disastrously botched handling of the pandemic and the ensuing economic collapse? If it\u2019s not the media\u2019s fault, it\u2019s the doctors and scientists, or the governors or the Chinese. Someone, anyone, not called Trump.</p> <p>There is some history to this one, naturally. When Hurricane Maria ripped through Puerto Rico in our antihero\u2019s first year in office, he thought it was fine and dandy to let the sick and elderly die. In the early days, the official death toll was so low it was actually worth celebrating their deaths on his one and only trip to the American colony after the storm.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina, and you look at the tremendous hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died, and you look at what happened here with, really, a storm that was just totally overpowering,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-briefing-hurricane-maria-relief-efforts/\">said</a>, \u201cnobody has ever seen anything like this. What is your death count, as of this moment? Seventeen? Sixteen certified. Sixteen people versus in the thousands. You can be very proud of all of your people, all of our people working together.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, they weren\u2019t working together because they had no commander-in-chief. At the time Trump was talking, the death toll was growing exponentially because our so-called president failed to surge supplies to the island. So the sick and the elderly died in their thousands because there was no reliable power, clean water or food, in hospitals and senior centers.</p> <p>Anyone who complained, like the mayor of San Juan, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-feuds-with-san-juan-mayor-as-tropical-storm-takes-direct-aim-at-puerto-rico/2019/08/28/6b5170e2-c990-11e9-be05-f76ac4ec618c_story.html\">was</a> corrupt or crazy or incompetent: a combination of qualities that Trump should actually trademark. And when the real death toll finally emerged \u2013 at <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/05/29/trump-once-favorably-compared-puerto-ricos-death-toll-to-katrinas-a-new-study-shows-more-than-twice-as-many-died/\">more than</a> 4,600 Americans \u2013 it was naturally all a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/13/us/politics/trump-fact-check-hurricane.html\">plot</a> by Democrats to make him look bad.</p> <p>Those old and sick Americans in Puerto Rico were no different from the old and sick Americans whose lives are so cheap for Trump and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/older-people-would-rather-die-than-let-covid-19-lockdown-harm-us-economy-texas-official-dan-patrick\">Texas</a> lieutenant governor and the editorial <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/rethinking-the-coronavirus-shutdown-11584659154\">board</a> of the Wall Street Journal.</p> <p>If only we could target the virus to those who get in the way of our economy and, more importantly, Donald Trump\u2019s re-election. It would be so much easier than sourcing more ventilators, or respirator masks, or reviving an economy that is heading for depression.</p> <p>That would require leadership, or at least crisis management skills: rallying a government and nation to a common cause to save each other and ourselves. All the rest is the wishful thinking of a group of people whose malign influence is now a matter of fact.</p> <p>The coronavirus has no sense of morality: it just spreads its selfish genes, along with its misery and chaos, as fast as it can. At long last, this president has finally met his soulmate.</p>",
  "<p>As I sit here, in between homeschooling the child (after tearing him down from whatever curtains he has been climbing in animal frustration), throwing painkillers and bad vibes at a husband bedbound with what is merely some coronavirus wannabe (nothing else counts! Pick up thy bed and walk!) and keeping one foot at all times pressed firmly on the throat of the gibbering terror that threatens to rear up and consume me throughout the day, I am very grateful for anything that makes me laugh. It\u2019s a short list, but to it may be added <a href=\"https://www.sky.com/watch/hitmen\">the new Sky One comedy Hitmen</a>, starring Mel and Sue in \u2013 if we skip lightly over the briefly rebooted Generation Game misfire \u2013 their first post-Bake Off venture together.</p> <p>They play the eponymous assassins, Fran and Jamie (and if you write in saying it should be called Hitwomen, so help me God I will come round and shoot you myself), who approach the job with \u2013 well, about as much competence and enthusiasm as you would expect Mel and Sue to approach it. It plays into and off their natural and long-established dynamic so naturally that if you have come across them before and not found them to your taste, you will probably be unlikely to laugh at their semi-murdery misadventures here. I would \u2013 respectfully! With only your long-term health and contentment in mind! \u2013 suggest you find another, more conducive spot in the fertile land of TV scheduling to dig in for your furlough.</p> <p>But for fans, there\u2019s a lot to enjoy. Fran (Sue, ever the detached, cerebral wit of the pair) is, as you might expect, the brains; Jamie (Mel) is \u2026 not. Giedroyc\u2019s innate warmth and eagerness and the joyful embrace of her inner simpleton should put her, in a very few years\u2019 time, in contention for national treasure status. Until then, we may continue to enjoy it unofficially.</p> <p>Each half hour is a slightly plotted caper. The first revolves around Fran and Jamie trying to arrange the former\u2019s birthday dinner while awaiting the command from their boss, Mr K, to kill the lawyer (Jason Watkins) who has been defrauding him and who has been sitting in the back of their battered van with a bag over his head and his hands tied since they kidnapped him. He\u2019s eager to help: \u201cNow that the adrenaline\u2019s worn off I\u2019m actually pretty bored in here.\u201d He\u2019s also a bit uncomfortable. \u201cAny chance of a bigger bag? I mean, not silly-big.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s fun and daft \u2013 unsophisticated enough to give it an enjoyably homely feel (excepting the occasional shock when one or other of our former patisserie-pluggers has to level a gun and at last get a job done), but never descending into idiocy. I even had to think for a second to get the Captain Birdseye joke, but that may be the blunting effects of ongoing self-isolation at work. I have lost all ability to imagine how I might have reacted in the Before Times.</p> <p>In addition, the first two episodes have great guest appearances. One is by Sian Clifford (most famous for playing Fleabag\u2019s terrifyingly brittle sister, Claire), who plays the head of a wealth-fund management as a magnificent virago. She scoffs at the duo\u2019s reluctant plan to torture her for an account\u2019s password (\u201cMy personal trainer,\u201d she snarls, \u201csays I have the pain threshold of someone in a medically induced coma\u201d) before ultimately being undone by a soy allergy.</p> <p>The other appearance is by Nick Mohammed (writer and star of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/21/intelligence-review-never-has-david-schwimmer-been-so-squandered\">another Sky sitcom, Intelligence</a>) as a spider man \u2013 sent by the agency instead of the stripper Jamie booked for Fran\u2019s birthday. \u201cNot Spider-Man,\u201d he notes, the pain of a man doomed to eternal misunderstanding etched on his face. \u201cGod. Every time.\u201d Honestly, his few minutes on camera cheered me up like nothing else. (Is self-isolation really getting to me? Or is it just freeing me from the shackles of social restraint and enabling me to speak sooth? I will gladly discuss this on the online social medium of your choice while cooking the ninth meal of the day.)</p> <p>Hitmen may be just a bit too woolly and broadbrush to make a hit in the grander scheme of things. But it finds its target often enough to be more than worth your while. Although a special retrofitted Bake-Off series to get us through viral lockdown wouldn\u2019t go amiss either.</p>",

  "<p>The All England Club will decide at an emergency meeting next week if it is advisable or even viable to hold this year\u2019s Wimbledon tournament, due to start on 29 June, but the mood is downbeat. The outgoing AELTC chief executive, Richard Lewis, said on Wednesday night the main board are \u201cworking hard to bring certainty to our plans\u201d, after much recent speculation.</p> <p>Lewis, who acknowledges a postponement would be difficult, said the club will consult with the game\u2019s main stakeholders \u2013 the LTA, ATP, WTA, ITF and the other three grand slams. He added: \u201cThe single most important consideration is one of public health, and we are determined to act responsibly through the decisions we make.\u201d</p> <p>Wimbledon, which sits perilously close to the prime minister\u2019s best-case forecast for a flattening out of coronavirus within 12 weeks, have abandoned plans to leave the decision until late April.</p> <p>\u201cWith such uncertainty about, changing big, long-term contracts and setting mutually acceptable new dates is difficult and complicated, as can be seen from what has been happening with the Olympics,\u201d said an insider with long experience of negotiating international TV sporting deals on Wednesday. \u201cFor that reason, I\u2019d say the chances of Wimbledon going ahead in June are slim to zero. You go with it now or you call it off.\u201d</p> <p>He said the same strategic thinking underpinned the decision this week by the Japanese government and the IOC <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/24/tokyo-olympics-to-be-postponed-to-2021-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic\" title=\"\">to postpone the Tokyo Olympics</a>. They originally announced they would decide within four weeks; ultimately, the call was forced on them within 24 hours. The new date for the Games, the source said, would be determined by an international sporting calendar that is set in stone \u2013 except, of course, when disrupted by something as unexpected and life-threatening as a global health crisis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/18/tennis-bodies-suspend-sport-until-7-june-with-sideswipe-at-french-open\">Tennis bodies suspend sport until 7 June with sideswipe at French Open</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt is a matter of finding a window,\u201d he said, \u201cand there aren\u2019t many of those for big sporting events. American TV, to a large extent, determines when a lot of these events can take place. It is not just about the tennis schedule. There is NFL, college sport, baseball, golf and, to a much lesser extent there, [ice] hockey, soccer and tennis.\u201d</p> <p>Against this background, and the quickening spread of Covid-19 \u2013 in reaction to which Roger Federer has donated one million Swiss francs to vulnerable families in Switzerland \u2013 there would seem to be dwindling belief within the All England Club that Wimbledon will escape postponement or even cancellation, as has been the case with practically every other sport.</p> <p>Sources say it is highly unlikely Wimbledon would seek to fill the gap created by the postponement of the Olympic Games. The thinking is that it is safer \u2013 and more convenient \u2013 to stick with the existing arrangements, however perilous in terms of planning, than disturb a system that has been in place for years. </p> <p>Time is not on their side given the scale of the operation. It takes up to two months to get the site ready for the championships so, realistically, a decision needs to be made by the end of April or the start of May at the latest. The chances of a return to normality in that timeframe do not look promising. It may be tempting for the AELTC to switch its efforts to its expansion across the road from the main grounds on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/10/wimbledon-tennis-73-acres-wimbledon-park-golf-club\" title=\"\">newly acquired Wimbledon Park Golf Club</a>.</p> <p>Early visitors to Wimbledon will know how close to their deadline contractors have to go in setting up everything from corporate marquees to the many shops dotted around the grounds, as well as parking provisions and security. Wimbledon is, in effect, a small town that comes to life for a fortnight once a year.</p> <p>So, while officially the AELTC is still monitoring the situation, there is acknowledgment the sporting landscape remains too volatile \u2013 in the UK and globally \u2013 for an event as big as Wimbledon to commit to definitely going ahead.</p> <p>The difficulties in moving Wimbledon deeper into the tennis schedule became obvious nearly two weeks ago when the French Tennis Federation (FFT) decided unilaterally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/17/french-open-tennis-postponed-until-late-september-due-to-coronavirus\" title=\"\">to reposition its championships</a> away from the crisis high-point of the spreading virus in May to the supposedly safer waters of September.

Among other considerations, this seeks to protect its insurance claims given it can argue the decision has been taken out of its hands.</p> <p>Nonetheless, if, as Boris Johnson says, it will take at least three months for coronavirus to noticeably start fading, the odds on Wimbledon going ahead in June are surely indeed \u201cslim to zero\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>Supermarkets are being given access to a government database to help prioritise food deliveries for elderly and vulnerable shoppers who have been ordered to stay at home under the government\u2019s coronavirus crackdown.</p> <p>With all the major grocers\u2019 online delivery slots booked up weeks in advance, getting food to those self-isolating was top priority in a call between industry bosses and the environment secretary, George Eustice, on Tuesday.</p> <p>Supermarket bosses discussed ways to ramp up deliveries and prioritise orders from those in need, including working on new ways to extend delivery networks such as teaming up with local taxi companies and takeaway delivery firms.</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s and Waitrose said they would begin writing to existing online customers, who were also on the government database, to offer them a delivery slot. Sainsbury\u2019s said it expected to begin contacting people next week and was also working on ways to secure details for vulnerable people living in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s has already used information from its Nectar loyalty scheme to try to prioritise elderly shoppers online, proactively contacting 270,000 people. It also has a helpline which vulnerable shoppers can ring for help in booking delivery slots. However, shoppers told the Guardian that accessing the helpline was difficult because of very high demand. </p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s admitted that its customer careline had been inundated with requests from elderly and vulnerable customers, with one year\u2019s worth of contacts in two weeks.</p> <p>It said it had already booked delivery slots for 115,000 elderly, disabled and vulnerable customers this week.</p> <p>The retailer is also closing about 10 smaller local stores, mostly in locations such as train stations, to prioritise busier outlets and online.</p> <p>While many supermarkets have set aside special shopping periods in store for the vulnerable and elderly, the latest advice to stay at home has stepped up the need for delivery services.</p> <p>The government is also teaming up with food service providers Brakes and Bidfood to put together an emergency food parcel scheme that could provide essentials to 300,000 of the most vulnerable of 1.5 million people identified as needing assistance by the government.</p> <p>The scheme, which could launch as early as next week, is expected to link up the delivery networks of the food service companies \u2013 which usually supply catering businesses and restaurants \u2013 with local volunteers and charities.</p> <p>One industry source said that the government had initially approached supermarkets to support the scheme but it had quickly become apparent that food service firms had more capacity to cope because of lost orders from their usual clients, most of which have been forced to close under the government\u2019s measures to control the spread of the virus.</p> <p>Morrisons said it had already delivered 10,000 boxes of essential groceries after beginning tests on a new scheme this week which operates using couriers rather than via its Morrisons.com network. The retailer expects to ramp up production of two \u00a330 boxes of essentials in the coming week.</p> <p>Morrisons is also extending its Morrisons.com and quick delivery service via Amazon\u2019s Prime Now subscription option by taking on thousands of staff to pick, pack and deliver groceries from 100 more stores in the coming month.</p> <p>Marks &amp; Spencer is launching a service with takeaway courier firm Deliveroo in which it will deliver bread, milk and other essentials from franchise outlets on BP forecourts.</p> <p>Tesco is bringing in 8,000 new drivers to help with deliveries and said it had already appointed 12,500 new staff out of a total of 20,000 required.</p> <p>Tesco said it would be joining other supermarkets by installing protective screens for staff, marking out safe distances for queueing and creating separate entrances and exits for shoppers.</p> <p>New rules announced on Monday night stipulate that retailers remaining open during the high street lockdown, such as supermarkets, must ensure there is a 2-metre distance between customers and staff and that shoppers enter in small groups, so that spaces do not become crowded. The government has also ordered retailers to manage queues outside their stores.</p>",
  "<p>Hospitals across the US are postponing non-emergency procedures as they deal with staff shortages and a dangerously low supply of protective equipment amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>The CDC and the American College of Surgeons have recommended that hospitals, health systems and surgeons work to postpone or cancel elective and non-urgent procedures. The college of surgeons said this practice should stay in place until it\u2019s clear \u201cthat our health care infrastructure can support a potentially rapid and overwhelming uptick in critical patient care needs\u201d.</p> <p>Ali Santore, group vice-president for government and public affairs at Providence St Joseph Health, which includes 51 hospitals across seven US states, said in its Everett and Seattle hospitals there was \u201cserious concern\u201d that they will run out of surgical masks and face shields in a matter of days.</p> <p>Nurses and caregivers from their Spokane, Washington, location recently had to drive about six hours to deliver face masks to Everett because they were running out, she said. Other staff members have started making their own face shields from what\u2019s available on their shelves.</p> <p>Their healthcare locations, which includes a hospital in Everett that treated the first person in the US diagnosed with coronavirus, have seen more than 100 cases and 556 potential cases.</p> <p>Santore said the hospital has started using a chatbot to virtually screen patients before they come in, which has helped to curb the \u201cworried well\u201d visitors. But they are still facing challenges with staffing, as nurses and physicians call in sick or struggle to come in because of childcare issues resulting from school closures. Santore said nursing staff have started contacting retired nurses who still have active licenses, to see if they can help.</p> <p>\u201cRight now, the situation is fairly stable, what we\u2019re concerned with is if there\u2019s a surge like we are anticipating, as the numbers and the modeling show us,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Last week, the governor of Washington, Jay Inslee, ordered a halt to all elective surgeries and dental services, including non-urgent cardiac procedures and most joint replacements and cataract procedures. He said this was meant to help the state conserve protective equipment, which has been \u201cseverely disrupted\u201d amid the outbreak.</p> <p>Robert Cruickshank was due to have his gallbladder removed in Seattle this week, after doctors found several gallstones inside. One had already gotten dislodged, and they were worried others could follow.</p> <p>But three days before the procedure, he received a call from a staff member at University of Washington Medicine, who said the hospital needed to postpone the surgery to conserve resources, and that they would follow up sometime soon about rescheduling.</p> <p>\u201cMy concern is that all of a sudden something happens, I have another attack, and either there\u2019s a serious complication or I go to the ER and there\u2019s no room for me because they have even more urgent concerns,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> <p>In a statement released this week, Bonnie Castillo, executive director of National Nurses United, a registered nurses union, said the healthcare capacity in this country is nowhere near what is necessary to address this pandemic. She stressed the importance of substantially increasing the supply of powered air purifying respirators and N95 respirators, along with protective clothing and gear.</p> <p>\u201cWe should also prioritize testing and paid quarantine for nurses and other healthcare workers who are exposed, to prevent the further spread of the virus and to meet the demand of a surge,\u201d she said.</p> <p>In New York, health centers like NewYork-Presbyterian and Rochester Regional Health have postponed all elective procedures and surgeries. The Mount Sinai Health System announced this week it is prohibiting all visitors, with exceptions only for healthy people visiting such areas as the NICU, maternity and palliative care areas.</p> <p>\u201cPreventing avoidable exposure is critical to ensure that we can continue to respond to this public health crisis,\u201d the health system said in a statement.</p> <p>Officials think the virus spreads mainly from person to person through coughs or sneezes. Most coronavirus infections cause mild symptoms, but for some at a higher risk, including older people and those with chronic illness, it can cause more severe issues.</p> <p>New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, has repeatedly called on the federal government for assistance, and said the state does not have enough hospital beds to address the crisis. On Monday, Cuomo confirmed that coronavirus cases in the state had ballooned to more than 20,000 \u2013 by far the highest total in the United States.</p> <p>Cuomo said he would issue an emergency order requiring the state\u2019s hospitals to up their capacity by at least 50%, though he would ask facilities to double their capacity if possible.</p> <p>He announced last week that the navy\u2019s Comfort hospital ship will be deployed to New York harbor to boost the state\u2019s hospital surge capacity. Both Washington and California leaders have requested navy hospital ships for their own efforts.</p> <p>The Zuckerberg San Francisco general hospital and trauma center, along with other hospitals in the city had also started postponing certain non-emergency procedures, said Susan Ehrlich, its CEO. They had also started only allowing essential staff and few visitors, as well as screening everyone for a fever, cough or unexplained shortness of breath, she said.</p> <p>Even with all of these measures in place, Ehrlich said the hospital was still in need of more personal protective equipment, including face shields, masks, gloves and gowns, and also tests for the virus.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have the ability to test everybody who should or wants to get a test, not even close,\u201d said Ehrlich.</p> <p>She said she did not know a hospital that wasn\u2019t struggling with supply of these things, calling this a national issue.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand how our country can\u2019t produce enough of these supplies or enough tests to be able to make sure there\u2019s plenty of them on hand to meet the challenge of this disease,\u201d said Ehrlich.</p> <p>Donald Trump has so far refused to invoke the Defense Production Act, a Korean war-era law that allows government to mandate private businesses to produce needed goods during a national emergency. Instead, the federal government has relied on voluntary efforts from private industry.<br><br>The CEO of 3M, Mike Roman, has said the company was urgently ramping up production of N95 respirator masks, and that New York and Washington state would receive half a million masks, beginning on Monday.</p>",

  "<p>Get a bloody move on. That was not, obviously, the wording of the exhortation to banks in <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/joint-letter-to-the-uk-banks-from-hm-treasury-the-bank-of-england-and-the-fca\">Wednesday\u2019s joint letter</a> from the chancellor, the governor of the Bank of England and head of the Financial Conduct Authority. But the gist was clear. The authorities are worried that their emergency measures are not being implemented on the ground by lenders \u2013 or, at least, not fast enough.</p> <p>The regulatory trio said they want to see \u201call action necessary\u201d and \u201ca willingness to maintain and extend lending\u201d, with the aim of ensuring that \u201cfirms whose business models were viable before this crisis remain viable once it is over\u201d.</p> <p>The language may have been formally polite, but consider the context. It was as recently as Monday this week that the governor and the chairs of six big banks issued a joint \u201cwe\u2019re here to help\u201d statement. Relations seemed harmonious at that point; not now.</p> <p>What\u2019s happened since? It seems the Treasury and the Bank have been bombarded by phone calls from irate business owners and executives who have heard about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/17/billions-in-loans-scrapping-of-rates-the-chancellors-help-for-businesses\">Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/17/billions-in-loans-scrapping-of-rates-the-chancellors-help-for-businesses\">, and suchlike</a>, but say they can\u2019t get their hands on the promised cash.</p> <p>For their part, the banks (or some of them) resent the idea that they\u2019re not working flat out to get money out of the door. The scheme, they point out, came with eligibility criteria and not every applicant will qualify. They\u2019re also meant to be lending only to businesses that would be viable under normal conditions.</p> <p>There\u2019s also an under-appreciated gap in the Treasury\u2019s initiatives, say lenders. The scheme is for companies with an annual turnover of less than \u00a345m, but not all firms above that threshold have a credit rating that would allow easy access to the equivalent commercial paper scheme for larger companies. Then there are problems created by self-isolating staff being absent in branches and call centres.</p> <p>From the outside, it\u2019s hard to tell how serious these tensions are. The Treasury is bound to want instant implementation; lenders will inevitably say the process of distributing loans is not like turning on a tap. The picture could improve.</p> <p>Yet \u201cmonitoring the situation closely\u201d is standard regulatory-speak for a heavy warning. The verbal rocket may be justified. Alternatively, the government wants someone to blame if companies go bust in their droves. Neither interpretation is good.</p> <h2>Through a glass, darkly</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/24/wetherspoons-denies-abandoning-staff-in-coronavirus-crisis\">Tim Martin</a>\u2019s campaign to make himself the most unpopular business person in the country is going splendidly. In his latest move, the JD Wetherspoon founder has told suppliers they won\u2019t be paid until pubs reopen.</p> <p>One can \u2013 just about \u2013 see how Martin might rationalise his hardball stance. If Wetherspoon is not allowed to sell the goods it has ordered, it should be given more time to pay, he may reason.</p> <p>Yet such a literal-minded view ignores a few business realities. Wetherspoon is a large company with a strong balance sheet and ready access to bank loans. Not all its suppliers are in the same position. Big brewers can look out for themselves, but a cashflow crisis could spin out of control for the smaller food and drink crew. This is a moment for the strong to look out for the weak.</p> <p>He presumably calculates that customers don\u2019t care enough to change their drinking and eating habits when the doors re-open. He may be right, but one wonders.</p> <h2>Inflation basket case</h2> <p>Consumer price inflation in the UK was 1.7% in February, as if anybody is interested. The reading is from another era.</p> <p>For what it\u2019s worth, most economists think inflation will soon fall below 1%, which sounds entirely plausible. For starters, the effect of the collapse in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/06/oil-price-plummets-as-opec-fails-to-agree-production-cuts\">price of oil</a> will be felt in a wide range of goods and services. Food may increase in price (because sterling has fallen) but it\u2019s hard to think of many other major examples.</p> <p>But will the monthly CPI measure even be helpful in the next few months? How will the statisticians get a handle on the price of an airline ticket or a meal in a restaurant when planes are grounded and eateries are closed? The \u201ctypical shopping basket\u201d approach to measuring inflation is not designed for current times.</p>",

  "<p>Before December\u2019s general election, Boris Johnson promised cross-party talks on the crisis in Britain\u2019s social care system <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/04/boris-johnson-sets-out-plans-for-first-100-days-if-he-wins-election\" title=\"\">within 100 days</a> of a new Conservative government. The self-imposed deadline expired at the weekend. In the context of the biggest public health crisis for 100 years, that\u2019s understandable. But as the coronavirus epidemic tests to destruction the political assumptions and priorities that have shaped our society, alarm bells are once again ringing in the care sector and must not be ignored.</p> <p>As Britain experiences its first week of lockdown, there are reports of some providers finding themselves <a href=\"https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/18332410.coronavirus-hove-care-home-worries-food-amid-covid-19/\" title=\"\">unable to access adequate food supplies</a> as a result of supermarket restrictions. Care England <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CareEngland/status/1242448795432103937\" title=\"\">has expressed concern</a> that social care employees are not being recognised as key workers by some schools, shops and supermarkets, despite <a href=\"https://www.nursingtimes.net/news/coronavirus/student-nurses-and-social-care-staff-listed-as-key-workers-20-03-2020/\" title=\"\">clarification by the government</a> of their status.</p> <p>Huge risks are being taken by care workers in the absence of adequate protection. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has assured parliament that all care settings should have personal protective equipment <a href=\"https://www.laingbuissonnews.com/care-markets-content/news/ppe-in-all-care-settings-by-end-of-the-week-says-hancock/\" title=\"\">by the end of this week</a>. That simply must happen. But it still <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maxine1966/status/1242554961168420866\" title=\"\">seems unclear</a> whether social care providers will be guaranteed the hand sanitiser, aprons and gloves they need, as well as masks.</p> <p>These issues are symptomatic of a flawed system that has too often treated the social care sector as a second-class auxiliary health service, to be left to the vagaries of market forces and cash-strapped local authorities. Cross-party talks can wait. But this mindset must change immediately.</p> <p>Given the clear evidence of Covid-19\u2019s lethal impact on the elderly, it is fair to say that, along with hospitals, care homes are the most vulnerable institutions in Britain. There are over <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5941057be5274a5e4e00023b/care-homes-market-study-update-paper.pdf\" title=\"\">1</a><a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5941057be5274a5e4e00023b/care-homes-market-study-update-paper.pdf\" title=\"\">1,000</a> in Britain. Most are small and run by independent providers. The rest are operated by the big care groups and local authorities. The valiant, poorly paid staff who work in them face a potential perfect storm in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Appalling remuneration for a stressful job \u2013 one that requires considerable social and technical skills \u2013 has contributed to a <a href=\"https://www.homecareinsight.co.uk/groundbreaking-website-launched-to-fight-social-care-recruitment-crisis/\" title=\"\">recruitment crisis</a> in the sector. That has now been compounded by staff absences, due to a lack of any Covid-19 testing equipment. As in our hospitals, this has led to nurses and other workers self-isolating when that might not have been necessary.</p> <p>Public Health England on Wednesday suggested that mass testing for key workers could soon be possible. That, clearly, would be a gamechanger. It is imperative that care homes are provided with priority access as staff attempt to control perilous closed environments. The evidence is already in <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-spain-lockdown-ins/lockdown-nursing-homes-in-spain-a-vector-for-deadly-coronavirus-idUKKBN2190N7\" title=\"\">from countries such as Spain</a> that transmission in residential homes can be swift and deadly.</p> <p>Carers are currently working in the dark as to which care home residents or clients may have contracted coronavirus. The CEO of one charity, which runs 200 care homes, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/24/care-homes-demand-urgent-coronavirus-testing-equipment-outbreaks/\" title=\"\">said this week</a> that there have been deaths where the disease was suspected, but that there was no way of confirming the outbreak.</p> <p>As a staffing crisis looms and more carers fall ill, a drive similar to the \u201cNHS needs you\u201d campaign, <a href=\"http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/clinical/clinical-specialties/respiratory-/government-formally-launches-nhs-needs-you-campaign-for-retired-gps/20040405.article\" title=\"\">launched by the government</a> last week, may soon be needed to persuade former carers to return to work. To make this a success , the challenges and requirements of the sector need a higher political profile, more public awareness and greater backing.</p> <p>Inadequately funded, undervalued and still not properly integrated into Britain\u2019s health services, social care has endured a Cinderella status for too long. That scandal cannot be allowed to lead to tragedy during this national crisis. Whether working in care homes or visiting vulnerable people and helping them maintain their independence, social care workers are truly unsung heroes. In an epidemic which seeks out and targets the elderly, they are on the frontline of resistance. There must be a focus on their needs that is commensurate with the responsibilities they carry.</p>",
  "<p>Prime minister\u2019s questions in the House of Commons typifies British democracy in some respects. It fulfils an essential function by means of convention, and it often promotes theatrical performance over legal substance. Executive power wielded from Downing Street is wide-ranging and, if the incumbent commands a large parliamentary majority, hard to check in practice. But prime ministers cannot hide from interrogation by MPs. Their strengths are proven and their weaknesses exposed.</p> <p>Boris Johnson has not feared Jeremy Corbyn in that arena and will not face the outgoing Labour leader again after Wednesday\u2019s session. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/25/jeremy-corbyn-presses-boris-johnson-on-coronavirus-in-last-pmqs-as-labour-leader-video\" title=\"\">The valedictory exchanges</a> were true to type for each man. Mr Corbyn raised important issues regarding the coronavirus response, but without forensic rigour. Mr Johnson gave responses too void of information to qualify as answers.</p> <p>The weekly routine of hurling barbs across the despatch box is not often edifying. David Cameron once pledged to end \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/13/punch-and-judy-politics-review-the-unique-ordeal-of-prime-minister-questions\" title=\"\">Punch and Judy politics</a>\u201d, but failed to stop the pantomime element. Mr Corbyn has tried to change the tone, introducing questions sent to his office from members of the public \u2013 an innovation that was mocked in Westminster, although it did expose some of the vacuity of the usual proceedings.</p> <p>But the Labour leader\u2019s unfocused method has given successive prime ministers an easy ride. Tory whips have eased their leaders\u2019 burden by planting soft questions with sycophantic MPs who, for example, invite the prime minister to join them in celebrating the government\u2019s achievements. Another unwelcome habit is the tendency to deliver micro-speeches for use later as self-promoting digital clips. The Commons was overly theatrical before MPs started using it as a stage scenery for their Facebook campaigns.</p> <p>Parliament is also host to erudite speeches and great acts of persuasion. Much of that goes unnoticed because PMQs has the higher profile and showcases the worst, not the best. A civil, respectful debate on the coronavirus bill earlier this week was a better spectacle because it was unspectacular. MPs were thoughtful and measured in grappling with the dilemma of how to restrict public activity without suffocating civil society. Partisan hostilities were suspended.</p> <p>Government by perpetual consensus is not possible. Robust debate in an oppositional system can protect against excess cosiness in the political class, but a crisis such as the one currently unfolding also illuminates the ground where politics must transcend normal political battle lines. The adversarial style is not always fitted to times of national adversity, and at those moments the Commons is capable of encompassing disagreement over policy within an understanding of common political enterprise.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/uk-parliament-to-close-early-for-easter-amid-coronavirus-fears\" title=\"\">Parliament breaks for recess</a> at the end of this week and it is not yet clear how the legislature\u2019s function in holding the government to account can be performed in a state of lockdown. That is a cause for concern, but there is reassurance in the disciplined and serious response of MPs to the crisis so far. The old institutions are imperfect but robust, anachronistic at times but creative in extremis. It is easy to find examples in recent years of Westminster politics at its worst, but rising to the present challenge can also be a moment when British democracy performs at its best.</p>",

  "<p>Gunmen and suicide bombers have killed at least 25 worshippers, including women and children, and injured many others in an early morning attack on a Sikh Gurdwara in the heart of Kabul.</p> <p>The attack lasted hours as the gunmen held hostages on Wednesday while Afghan special forces and international troops tried to end the siege in a complex that is home to many families, as well as a place of worship.</p> <p>Narender Singh Khalsa, a member of parliament who represents the Sikh community, told Reuters that there were three attackers, who arrived when the buildings were full of worshippers. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis\">Islamic State</a>, which has targeted Sikhs in Afghanistan before, said it carried out the attack.</p> <p>Up to 200 people were trapped inside the temple when the attack began at about 7am, interrupting worship that had started an hour earlier.

His headline announcement related to the NHS \u201cvolunteer army\u201d, but what was equally interesting was the defensiveness that seems to be creeping in to his public statements about coronavirus. He did not have a proper answer at all to Gary Gibbon\u2019s questions about why coronavirus testing in the UK was not as thorough as in some other countries, and he opened his statement with the words \u201cfrom the very beginning of this crisis I have followed the advice of our world-leading scientists\u201d - which did sound a little like someone starting to make excuses.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said that more than 400,000 people had expressed interest in joining<a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/2020/03/your-nhs-needs-you-nhs-call-for-volunteer-army/\"> the NHS \u201cvolunteer army\u201d announced yesterday.</a> </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When we launched the appeal last night we hoped to get 250,000 over a few days.</p> \n   <p>But I can tell you that in just 24 hours 405,000 people have responded to the call.</p> \n   <p>They will be driving medicines from pharmacies to patients.</p> \n   <p>They will be bringing patients home from hospital.</p> \n   <p>Very importantly they\u2019ll be making regular phone calls to check on and support people who are staying on their own at home.</p> \n   <p>And they will be absolutely crucial in the fight against this virus.</p> \n   <p>That is already \u2013 in one day \u2013 as many volunteers as the population of Coventry.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, blamed global shortages for the fact that they government was not carrying out more coronavirus tests. </strong>He was responding to a question from Channel 4 News <strong>Gary Gibbon, </strong>who asked why the UK was \u201cso woefully behind other countries\u201d when it came to testing. In response, Johnson did not provide an explanation, but insisted that the UK was ahead of some other EU countries and that testing was being ramped up. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are going up from 5,000 to 10,000 tests per day, to 25,000, hopefully very soon up to 250,000 per day. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Whitty addressed the question more directly. He said global shortages explained why there were not enough test kits. At the moment it was not possible to test NHS staff and others who were self-isolating, he said. He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This is a global problem. Basically, every country is wanting this new test for a disease that wasn\u2019t actually being tested for anywhere three months ago. So everybody wants, so there is a global shortage, and that\u2019s a bottleneck for us ...</p> \n   <p>There are multiple components in these tests, including the chemicals that make them up, the swabs that you use, and there are shortages along many of these supply chains, essentially because every county in the world is simultaneously wanting this new thing. Some components of this are old, but the scale of this is something which has obviously occurred at an extraordinary speed. And that\u2019s just a practical reality. Anyone who understands how supply chains work, and the huge demand for this globally, would understand that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson confirmed that the government might introduce wartime-style legislation to outlaw profiteering during the coronavirus crisis.</strong> Asked about the problem, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I dislike it very much and I do not want to see people profiteering, exploiting people\u2019s need at a critical time, in a national emergency.</p> \n   <p>We are indeed looking very carefully at what is going on.</p> \n   <p>The Competition and Markets Authority already has various powers that it may use but are looking at the legislative framework to see what it may be necessary to do to prevent profiteering just as happened in war time many years ago.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Whitty said the coronavirus peak would be \u201cprobably manageable\u201d for the NHS if people kept to the lockdown rules</strong>.

This is because they have limited reserves, constrained borrowing powers, and the funding flowing to them as a result of the Barnett formula may not reflect the challenges that they face. As a result, their ability to respond effectively may be delayed or compromised, and vital funding misallocated across the UK.

Ferguson\u2019s views are important because he was the lead author on<a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf\"> the Imperial College paper</a> that persuaded the government to drastically escalate its social distancing strategy.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Ferguson said that he and his colleagues were now \u201creasonably confident\u201d that the NHS would be able to cope with the coronavirus epidemic. </strong>That was partly because the NHS had surged its capacity, and partly because of the suppression measures taken by the government, he said.<br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There will be some areas that are extremely stressed but we are reasonably confident - which is all we can be at the current time - that at the national level we will be within capacity ...</p> \n   <p>If the current measures work as we would expect them then we will see intensive care demand peak in approximately two to three weeks and then decline thereafter.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said he would expect the strain on the NHS to peak in about three weeks\u2019 time. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If the current measures work as we would expect them to, then we will see intensive care unit demand peak in approximately two and a half to three weeks\u2019 time, and then decline thereafter. </p> \n   <p>The reason for that lag is because it takes people something like two to three weeks from being infected to being in an intensive care unit. So the measures put in place last week, intensified this week, we think will have had a significant effect on transmission. But it takes that time for it to propagate through to healthcare demand.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said he expected up to 10% of the population in London to get coronavirus.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that, as countries around the world relaxed the suppression measures they would impose, they would have to rely on other strategies such as testing and contact tracing. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We clearly cannot lock down the country for a year.</p> \n   <p>The challenge that many countries in the world are dealing with is how we move from an initial intensive lockdown ... to something that will have societal effects but will allow the economy to restart.</p> \n   <p>That is likely to rely on very large-scale testing and contact tracing.

This week the government said that businesses involved in non-essential work should close and tonight parliament itself is due to shut down, with MPs starting the Easter recess one week earlier than expected. <strong>Jacob Rees-Mogg,</strong> the leader of the Commons, has tabled a motion on today\u2019s order paper to that effect. The recess won\u2019t start until the coronavirus bill has been passed, but it is due to clear its final stages in the Lords later this afternoon. The decision to adjourn early comes as no great surprise, but it is yet one more sign of the way the coronavirus outbreak has upended all aspects of normal life.</p> \n  <p>This move means that today will be Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s last PMQs as Labour leader. In other circumstances this would have been a big moment, but today attention will be elsewhere.</p> \n  <p>The early adjournment obviously is not intended as a comment on parliament\u2019s usefulness, and today we should see some good examples of how MPs perform a vital scrutiny function. PMQs will mark the first time Boris Johnson has taken questions from anyone since he delivered his unprecedented lockdown directive on Monday night. And this morning there are two potentially important committee hearings, the highlight of which will be Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, being questioned by the science committee. Some have claimed that the experts are really running the country at the moment and, appropriately enough, Vallance is up at 12pm - the same time as PMQs.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea9f2b0569c1a3d014ee3de5ce67940dc469bed4\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea9f2b0569c1a3d014ee3de5ce67940dc469bed4/0_0_746_240/500.jpg\" alt=\"Adjournment motion\" width=\"500\" height=\"161\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adjournment motion</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: House of Commons</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> \n  <p><em>9.30am: </em>Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, gives evidence to the Commons work and pensions committee about coronavirus.</p> \n  <p><em>10.15am: </em>Prof Neil Ferguson, director of the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College gives evidence to the Commons science committee about coronavirus.

  "<p>The precise details of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/mar/25/market-us-covid-19-stimulus-deal-uk-inflation-retail-sales-ftse-business\">US stimulus package</a> are still to be revealed but some things are already clear: it will be massive, it will hit many of the right targets and it won\u2019t be enough.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start with the size. The deal worked out between the White House and Congress is worth $2tn (\u00a31.7tn), or about 10% of the annual output of the world\u2019s biggest economy. That is colossal by any standards. By comparison, the fiscal boost provided to mitigate the damage caused by the global financial crisis of 2008 amounted to $800bn.</p> <p>The US budget is going to explode this year. Depending on the length and depth of the recession, it could hit 20% of GDP.</p> <p>But with that sort of fiscal injection, you can afford to spread the money around, which is what the package does. If the advance reports are right, there will be a $1,200 cheque posted to American adults on a middle income or below, with an extra $500 for each child. On top of that, there will be more generous support for those losing their jobs, through the extension of unemployment insurance by 13 weeks and a four-month enhancement of benefits.</p> <p>Together, these mean Americans would get their full salaries for a guaranteed period if forced out of work by Covid-19.</p> <p>A quarter of the stimulus is aimed at business. There will be direct financial help for some sectors, such as airlines and airports, but the bulk of the corporate support comes in the form of loans and grants to businesses of all sizes. The US Treasury will put aside a sizeable sum to indemnify the Federal Reserve against losses it might incur from extending credit to struggling companies.</p> <p>Donald Trump is desperate to get the stimulus signed into law, which has allowed Democrats in Congress to extract some important concessions. The cash payments go in full to anyone earning less than $75,000 a year, and will then be tapered and not paid at all to anybody paid more than $99,000.</p> <p>The Democrats have also taken steps to avoid company bosses enriching themselves at the expense of the government. There will be a ban on share buybacks \u2013 a traditional form of enrichment for US CEOs \u2013 for the duration of any loan plus one year. Trump himself will not be able to benefit and there will be a new inspector general and oversight board to check that the aid is being properly spent.</p> <p>The size and the comprehensive nature of the package will limit the amount of pain that the US is going to suffer as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic but it is not going to eradicate it entirely.</p> <p>Wall Street is awaiting the weekly jobs report due out on Thursday with trepidation. Before the crisis broke, about 200,000 Americans a week were filing jobless claims. The lowest estimates for the latest week are 2 million and some are double that. The pain from a likely tripling of unemployment will be colossal.</p>",
  "<p>Landlords appear to be evicting tenants at record rates despite the government\u2019s promise that no one will lose their home because of coronavirus, Labour has said, as it called for an urgent package of housing benefit support.</p> <p>John Healey, the shadow housing secretary, said he had received a whistleblowing email from a property management company saying that evictions were at a record high in their region.</p> <p>The company told him there was anecdotal evidence that this was happening across the country, and said it was having to recruit more bailiffs to deal with demand.</p> <p>\u201cWe have appointed new agents to cope with the rapid increase in evictions,\u201d it said. \u201cWe have not seen any HM Government restrictions or official advice since the Covid-19 pandemic was announced.</p> <p>\u201cEstate agents, property management agents and landlords are very keen to evict tenants as they need the rent paid in full during these difficult times. Buy-to-let lenders have not offered any assistance to landlords from our experience. Essential workers are not exempt from such evictions.\u201d</p> <p>The government\u2019s new emergency legislation includes measures to stop eviction for the next three months, and the housing, communities and local government secretary, Robert Jenrick, said last week: \u201cThe government is clear \u2013 no renter who has lost income due to coronavirus will be forced out of their home, nor will any landlord face unmanageable debts.\u201d</p> <p>However, Labour and other critics pointed out that this only extended the notice required for possession from two months to three. Shelter, the housing charity, has said 20,000 evictions are currently going through the system and some people are likely to be left homeless while ill or trying to isolate because of vulnerabilities.</p> <p>Healey said Labour was calling for a guaranteed extra safety net for renters to ensure that no one loses their home as a result of the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>He said the party\u2019s own analysis showed that 6 million of the country\u2019s 8.5 million renting households have no savings to fall back on and are particularly vulnerable to loss of income during the crisis.</p> <p>The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has announced that the government will raise housing benefit to cover those in the cheapest 30% of private rented properties, but Labour said this did not go far enough.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In addition to calling for a six-month ban on evictions and rent suspensions, Healey called for a doubling in the funding for discretionary housing payments to allow councils to cover rent shortfalls in around 300,000 additional cases, and a relaxation of property size restrictions on housing benefit for private renters.</p> <p>He said the government should also raise benefit rates for private renters to at least cover average rents in each area, and relax the current cap on benefit payments, which hits families facing high housing costs.</p> <p>\u201cAfter a decade of cuts, our housing safety net is already letting renters slip through the gaps,\u201d Healey said. \u201cIt is not fit for purpose for the period we now face when family finances will be under extra pressure.</p> <p>\u201cThe chancellor\u2019s commitments so far only partly row back on these cuts, and government action falls well short of what renters need. The government must now urgently give renters a guarantee they will not lose their home as a result of coronavirus, by strengthening the safety net for households who have their hours cut or lose their job.\u201d </p>",

This is particularly important given the aggressive fiscal stimulus from European and Asian governments in the past two weeks.

To answer this question we are following the employment data closely. If government policies prevent people from losing their jobs then a bounce back looks feasible.

The majority of this genetic detritus enters the bloodstream when harmless cells in the body break down and spill their molecular innards, but tumours also shed DNA as they form and grow larger.</p> <p>The UK has no national lung cancer screening programme, but is exploring an approach adopted in the US where people who are at high risk, such as older smokers and former smokers, can have low-dose chest X-rays to check their lungs for tumours.</p> <p>That system has its flaws, though, according to Max Diehn, who studies radiation oncology at Stanford University. He said only 5% of people who are eligible for lung cancer screening in the US take up the offer. Among the 95% who do not, the reasons range from a lack of access to screening in their area and simple reluctance to have the check.</p> <p>\u201cA blood test option could dramatically increase the number of people who get screened, because many people are already having their blood drawn when they visit the doctors for an annual check up,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Writing in the journal <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2140-0\">Nature</a>, the scientists describe how their AI program crunched data on the DNA found in the blood of lung cancer patients to learn which common cancer mutations most effectively predicted the disease. The researchers then used the trained program to distinguish lung cancer patients from healthy people in a separate group of volunteers who gave blood samples for the study.</p> <p>The system cannot confidently diagnose cancer, but instead flags up likely cases for further medical investigation. In tests, the program had a 2% false positive rate \u2013 meaning that it mistakenly flagged two in every 100 healthy people as having the disease \u2013 while rating 55% of stage 2 cancers and nearly 70% of stage 3 cancers as patients likely to have the disease.</p> <p>\u201cCurrently we diagnose 60 to 70% of lung cancers at stage 4, when it has spread beyond the lungs,\u201d Diehn said. \u201cWith a test like ours, while not perfect, one could potentially identify the majority of cases as early stage disease when it is still potentially curable.\u201d</p> <p>The researchers found that only minuscule amounts of tumour DNA tend to circulate in the blood of lung cancer patients. A major challenge was to distinguish cancer-causing mutations in these fragments of DNA from the more common and largely harmless mutations in DNA shed from normal cells in the body. The more tumour DNA people had in their blood, the worse their future prospects, the study found, probably because more aggressive tumours shed more DNA.</p> <p>Dr David Crosby, head of early detection research at Cancer Research UK, said: \u201cToo many people die from lung cancer because many are diagnosed at a late stage when the disease is harder to treat. If we can detect lung cancer earlier, we could potentially save lives. This new research, which uses machine learning, offers a promising approach that could be used to detect lung cancer earlier, but further research, on a larger scale is needed to validate the findings.\u201d</p>",

  "<p> The Chats might have the least aspirational origin story in music: they began out messing around together in a friend\u2019s \u201cbong shed\u201d (where their chosen genre descriptor, \u201cshed-rock\u201d, was born) in a surf town on Queensland\u2019s east coast.</p> <p>Influenced by 1977 punks including the Buzzcocks and Wire as much as they were by the Australian outfits Cosmic Psychos and Frenzal Rhomb, the trio of high school friends \u2013 Eamon Sandwith, Josh Price and Matt Boggis \u2013 started writing their own material: hasty, crude and sparse punk songs with lyrics that channelled what they knew. Being bored in a small town. Bristling against authority. Scraping together spare change for bus fares, cheap beer and pub dinners.</p> <p>The first time they shared a song was for their Catholic high school\u2019s music class: called Mum Stole My Darts, it still has pride of place in their live shows.</p> <p>With a strawberry-blonde mullet and a pair of reflective, wraparound \u201cspeed-dealer\u201d sunglasses near-permanently attached to his face, Sandwith \u2013 the bassist and vocalist \u2013 is the most recognisable of the three. He was working as a \u201ccheckout chick\u201d at a supermarket before the band took off, a fact that affirms the Chats\u2019 working-class image and demonstrates the leap they\u2019ve taken from bumming cigarettes in their hometown to booking headline shows around the world \u2013 including at the now-postponed Coachella.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3c7ef1af379ea3c1d73adb315e5f2daba985ab6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3c7ef1af379ea3c1d73adb315e5f2daba985ab6/0_0_8708_11608/750.jpg\" alt=\"The Chats\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Chats\u2019 debut LP, High Risk Behaviour, is out on Friday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kane Hibberd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The band\u2019s image could read as bogan caricature or Muriel\u2019s Wedding cosplay: sunburnt barflies wearing thongs and hurling obscenities at any target (one another, passersby, politicians on the news) with the kind of drawl that invites \u201cCrikey!\u201d-filled impersonations from overseas audiences.</p> <p>In fact, this image is a product of where they\u2019re from but also what they value: the songs sound tight and the live shows look great, so who cares about the rest?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/21/australian-music-for-isolated-times-a-new-weekly-playlist\">Australian music for isolated times \u2013\u00a0a new weekly playlist</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The ratbag attitude runs deep. Their debut record, High Risk Behaviour \u2013 out this Friday \u2013 is named for a police infringement issued to drummer Boggis for skateboarding in public, and it features a song about how Sandwith\u2019s haircut got him refused entry to a nightclub. He thought the band would end when high school did, but live gigs at parties and local venues gave way to two EPs \u2013 a self-titled debut in 2016 and Get This in Ya the following year \u2013 and a following that grew exponentially after the video for their single Smoko was uploaded on the Facebook page for a surfwear store and went viral overnight. \u201cThey just ripped the full clip and put it up for themselves,\u201d Sandwith protests now. \u201cThey didn\u2019t tag us or anything!\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t a setback: the Chats began touring in earnest, supporting their heroes the Cosmic Psychos and joining the national Laneway festival run. A rumoured bidding war for their debut record was nullified when they decided to release High Risk Behaviour on Bargain Bin Records, an imprint they started to release their own and their friends\u2019 music. The \u201cwhere are they now\u201d page on their Catholic high school\u2019s website boasts them among a handful of notable alumni, writing that the 2016 graduates\u2019 music \u201cmay not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea, [but] they have certainly made an impact\u201d.</p> <p>The Chats are designed to provoke a reaction. In Australia it\u2019s a mix of familiar affection and an eye roll; but internationally \u2013 especially in the UK and Europe \u2013 they fill bigger rooms and are seen as equal parts punk throwback and novelty. \u201cAustralians seem kind of exotic,\u201d Sandwith says, \u201cand our music is very heavy Australiana.\u201d </p> <p>They\u2019ve conjured an impressive fanbase: Dave Grohl showed the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58V2vC9EPc\">Smoko video</a> to Josh Homme, who raved about them to Zane Lowe on Beats 1 and invited the band to open for Queens of the Stone Age on their Australian tour. \u201cWhen we met Iggy Pop he was like, what\u2019s a dart? What\u2019s a smoko?\u201d Sandwith laughs. (A cigarette and a cigarette break, respectively.) The alt-R\u2019n\u2019B artist <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=330556567632719\">Miguel posted a video</a> of him trying to approximate the band\u2019s accent; Idles and Shame have welcomed them into the fold.</p> <p>The image of Australiana they capture, though, is less The Castle and more Wake in Fright and the meme site Brown Cardigan \u2013 evinced in their latest film clip, which <a href=\"https://www.pedestrian.tv/music/the-chats-succulent-chinese-meal-meme-dine-n-dash-video/\">features the \u201csucculent Chinese meal\u201d guy</a> from an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XebF2cgmFmU\">extremely viral video</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9386f88035174a0274e92815bedc0ce2952b8289\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9386f88035174a0274e92815bedc0ce2952b8289/0_0_7952_5304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Chats\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s got nothing to do with where you were brought up, it\u2019s how you were brought up.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luke Henery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stories of drinking to take their minds off stifling heat and crippling boredom proliferate in their record; a character called \u201cBilly Backwash\u201d waits for the bottle shop to open and claims he can\u2019t be racist if he abuses everyone equally. The beer-soaked, sun-stroked reality of the larrikin steps into frame in 4573, a brilliant, blistering jam that paints a familiar scene: a man, four longneck lagers in, screaming his head off from the sidelines at a local kids\u2019 football game. \u201cHe\u2019s just like all the other dads,\u201d the lyrics say, before the repeated chorus of the band\u2019s Coolum Beach postcode \u2013 \u201c4573! 4573!\u201d \u2013 tinges local pride with something more sinister.</p> <p>\u201cI think 4573 shows a bit of a darker side about living in a regional town,\u201d Sandwith says. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much a celebration, [but] \u2019cause of that song everyone back home was like, \u2018Yeah, [you\u2019re] putting us on the map!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>That same intention \u2013 of tucking thoughtful ideas about the failings of society and the the trap of masculinity beneath quick and dirty couplets \u2013 was what motivated Sandwith to pick up his guitar on Christmas Eve, when enormous swathes of Australia were engulfed in bushfires and the country\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, begrudgingly returned from a holiday in Hawaii to address the crisis.</p> <p>\u201cMerry fuckin\u2019 Christmas, this one\u2019s called I Hope Scott\u2019s House Burns Down,\u201d Sandwith says, before blasting into the acoustic song for Instagram.</p> <p>\u201c[I thought] it\u2019d be funny if it, like, sounded, like, real cute and folky \u2026 rather than it sounding, like, real dirty.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/B6bxm0_HCws/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

At the time of our interview in early February, it has more than 1.9m views on Facebook and Instagram. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it to go as nuts as it did,\u201d he says. \u201cIt got fucking spread like wildfire.\u201d He catches the turn of phrase a moment too late, shakes his head and offers a dry laugh. \u201cFuck, sorry.

Ted O\u2019Brien, the local conservative member for the electorate where the Chats grew up, railed against them on the news, saying: \u201cIt says a lot more of the person who composed the song than it does about the prime minister.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve grown up knowing him as, like, \u2018that rightwing prick on the Sunshine Coast\u2019,\u201d Sandwith says now. \u201cTo see him on the news talking about us, that was so gold. I loved it. That was [my] favourite thing about it.\u201d</p> <p>Some grim but essential context is that Queensland essentially handed Morrison power, with 25 of the state\u2019s 30 seats voting for the conservative government in the 2019 election.</p> <p>\u201cBecause we have, like, this look and we\u2019re Queenslanders and we talk a certain way, people just think that we\u2019re, like, racists and whatever.

He is aware that the band\u2019s image and local pride attract fans who don\u2019t share his views \u2013 the ones who want to chant choruses about tinnies and ciggies \u2013 but told them not to \u201cget into politics\u201d after the video\u2019s release.</p> <p>Not talking about politics is in itself a political choice, I point out. \u201cExactly!\u201d he agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s complacent.

  "<p> I\u2019ve been using technology to organise virtual drinks with friends for a few years now. But what started as an idea to drink with interstate mates is now becoming the norm for social interaction.</p> <p>My friends and I have loved our virtual catch-ups as a way to check in with one another. There\u2019s always an \u201cOh wow, I needed that\u201d text message afterwards from someone in the group. When you\u2019re together but separated, it facilitates honest conversations. There\u2019s a different energy than you\u2019d have talking on the phone one-on-one.</p> <p>How else would I have learned that one of my friends used to spy on her classmates as a pre-schooler? How else would my friends know about my dislike for wearing pants at home (like Donald Duck), if I had not got up off the couch to pour more gin and accidentally flashed everyone?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/17/return-of-the-phone-call-why-talking-beats-texting-when-youre-in-isolation\">Return of the phone call: why talking beats texting when you're in isolation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In these times of isolation, whether it is self-imposed quarantine or for other reasons, we need to try to stay as connected as possible. It takes a little bit of planning, but bringing a group dynamic back to your socialising is something that can provide a bit of levity and joy when the days stuck indoors stretch on longer than normal. All you need is a computer or phone, an internet connection and a comfy place to sit.</p> <p>Through a bit of trial and error, here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned about hosting a virtual dinner party.</p> <h2>Step 1: organise your guest list</h2> <p>Any good party planner will tell you that your guests can make or break your party, so create a group chat of all the friends you want to invite.</p> <p>Four or five guests is large enough to get some good banter going (especially when the drinks start flowing) but small enough that no one feels left out of the conversation. Too many guests means people talking over one another, a big consideration when you\u2019re not there face to face to read the room.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"568095094bf26d2b920341f0b29edd295f6c4125\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/568095094bf26d2b920341f0b29edd295f6c4125/0_0_1039_969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samantha Payne and her friends having a virtual dinner party over Zoom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"933\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samantha Payne and her friends having a virtual dinner party over Zoom</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samantha Payne</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Step 2: familiarise yourself with the platform</h2> <p>FaceTime, Google Hangouts, Skype and web meeting tools like Zoom are handy platforms for hosting video conversations for multiple people. If it\u2019s your first time, give your group a couple of days before you want to \u201cmeet up\u201d to download any apps and familiarise their way around them.</p> <p>It\u2019s a real mood killer when most of your group are logged on and there\u2019s one person frustrated and yelling because they can\u2019t seem to work out how to get the video to show up \u2013 or can\u2019t log in at all because they\u2019re an Andriod user and you\u2019ve decided to meet over FaceTime.</p> <p>For Saturday night\u2019s drinks we trialled Zoom, which worked brilliantly but took a little setting up. We had to make sure everyone had an account, then create and schedule the \u201cmeeting room\u201d, then send out an email or text so that everyone could access it. So if you\u2019re trying to stay connected with your folks, stick to something simpler, that they\u2019re already familiar with.</p> <h2>Step 3: food and beverages</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/mar/25/back-of-the-pantry-five-australian-chefs-share-their-storeroom-recipes\">Back of the pantry: five Australian chefs share their storeroom recipes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Set the tone just like you would for an adventure out in the world. Try having a dinner party where everyone cooks the same dish in their own home from the same recipe and laugh at how badly they mangled it, or see which one of your friends has been hiding the expert cooking skills.</p> <p>You could also order delivery from different restaurants (they need your support now more than ever) and chat about them.</p> <p>When choosing the drinks selection, many restaurants around Australia are opening their cellars to the public for takeaways. Plus, independent wine shops, such as <a href=\"https://pnvmerchants.com/\">P&amp;V</a>, <a href=\"https://www.drnks.com/\">Drnks</a>, <a href=\"https://www.upstairswines.com.au/\">Upstairs Wine</a> and <a href=\"https://www.differentdrop.com/\">Different Drop</a>, have fantastic curated packs for different price points and taste preferences \u2013 and they deliver nationally.</p> <h2>Step 5: plan the next event</h2> <p>So you don\u2019t lose momentum, plan the next event while you\u2019ve still got everyone online. We lock in every Saturday night for drinks with the crew and agree on a host (and someone to organise the wine delivery to each of our homes). Then we schedule it like a meeting so we don\u2019t lose touch, just like you would in the real world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa5eedc13b8123542cff63f3876d3626f53ac7d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa5eedc13b8123542cff63f3876d3626f53ac7d5/0_251_1512_1553/974.jpg\" alt=\"Samantha Payne and her friends having a virtual dinner party\" width=\"974\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samantha Payne and her friends having a virtual dinner party</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samantha Payne</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Step 4: have fun</h2> <p> When things are difficult, it\u2019s important to check in on everyone, to make sure they\u2019re coping with the changes going on around them. It\u2019s easy to get wrapped up in the doom and gloom of current events, which have a way of hijacking your uplifting drinks session.</p> <p> A shared connection that gets everyone linked again and thinking of happier times should provide you with a bit of needed respite from the constant barrage of stress in uncertain times. Try not to feel guilty for having a couple of hours to laugh and forget the world for a moment \u2013 it will still be there when you hit the end-call button or turn off the laptop.</p>",

  "<p>Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) has emphasised the crucial importance of testing. Speed is of the essence, and three things are crucial: tracking down cases with symptoms; identifying their household cluster and tracing people they\u2019ve contacted; and quarantining them until they are no longer infectious. Testing is the basis of public health detective work to shut down an epidemic. \u201cYou can\u2019t fight a virus if you don\u2019t know where it is,\u201d said the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus<strong>,</strong> recently. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/transcripts/who-transcript-emergencies-coronavirus-press-conference-full-13mar2020848c48d2065143bd8d07a1647c863d6b.pdf?sfvrsn=23dd0b04_2\">Find, isolate, test and treat every case</a>, to break the chains of transmission. Every case we find and treat limits the expansion of the disease.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/23/how-to-social-distance-tips-convince-friends-family\">Physical distancing</a> is another strategy, but it\u2019s less effective than testing. In the early stages of an epidemic, when clusters are few and far between, one needs a huge population distancing effort to stop their spread. At that point, most people won\u2019t grasp the scale of the threat and will resist restrictive orders. So testing, contact tracing and quarantining people with symptoms is crucial. As the epidemic becomes rampant, as in London, the policy must switch to intensive testing to protect health workers.</p> <p>As with other coronavirus outbreaks in Europe, the UK\u2019s epidemic has progressed at different speeds across different regions. On Sunday, Dr KK Cheng, the director of the University of Birmingham\u2019s Institute of Applied Health Research, reported that 50 local authorities <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KKCheng4/status/1241868745485750274\">had </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KKCheng4/status/1241868745485750274\">10 or </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KKCheng4/status/1241868745485750274\">fewer reported coronavirus cases</a>. Rather than adopting a one-size-fits-all national policy, we need to devolve power to our local authorities and their public health outbreak teams. As Dr Cheng pointed out, \u201cIt isn\u2019t rocket science. [Testing] does not even require personal protective equipment. Retired GPs, junior medical and nursing students will be delighted to contribute. Case numbers are doubling every four days. Every minute counts now.\u201d</p> <p>Large-scale testing is about more than identifying and isolating cases. Information about the virus is power. Testing can help <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/16/resume-covid-19-testing-protect-frontline-nhs-staff\">protect health workers</a> and measure the progression of an epidemic. It can also provide evidence about regional variation and how the virus affects people of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/23/scientists-effects-coronavirus-children-studies-carriers\">different ages</a> and genders. Virologists can use information about cases to monitor the nature of the virus and any mutations. And data can show social and behavioural scientists whether their physical-distancing measures are working.</p> <p>Testing for the virus across the general population, in other words, can tell us whether our assumptions about coronavirus are correct. A new model from Prof Sunetra Gupta and a team of researchers at Oxford University, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ff6469a-6dd8-11ea-89df-41bea055720b\">published yesterday</a>, reaches conclusions that are very different from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/neil-ferguson-coronavirus-expert-who-is-working-on-despite-symptoms\">Imperial College models</a>. Crucially, the Oxford model is not peer reviewed \u2013 so we can\u2019t be assured that its findings are correct \u2013 but Gupta suggests that \u201conly a very small proportion of the population is at risk of hospitalisable illness\u201d and that more than half the population have already been exposed to the virus, largely without symptoms. </p> <p>If this were true, we could expect a big surge of hospitalisations and deaths over the next six weeks, but then the epidemic would recede, probably with no second wave. But to know whether this is actually the case, we urgently need immunity tests that will show whether people have had the virus.</p> <p>By 10 March, the rates of reported Covid-19 virus tests were one for every 243 people in South Korea, 995 in Italy, 2,585 in the UK, and 38,695 in the USA. On 12 March, the UK government announced it would stop all community virus detection tests, and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51857856\">focus just on health worker protection</a>. By 16 March, when it realised the NHS faced a potential meltdown if the epidemic went unchecked, the government reversed its policy; rather than mitigating the virus, it returned to a strategy of suppression.</p> <p>Public Health England is now reportedly increasing national laboratory <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/24/uk-coronavirus-live-news-lockdown-boris-johnson-sports-direct-abandons-talk-of-opening-stores-as-gove-clarifies-scope-of-lockdown-rules?page=with:block-5e7a40578f080f201096ce66#block-5e7a40578f080f201096ce66\">testing capacity in Milton Keynes</a>, but up until now the UK has still only been testing 5,000 specimens per day. In contrast, the Irish government has set up 41 mobile test centres which are processing 100,000 samples per week for a population of 4.9 million (the UK\u2019s population is an estimated 66.4 million).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/government-covid-19-plan-holes-four-groups\">The government's Covid-19 plan is full of holes \u2013 we must look after these four groups | John McDonnell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Every UK medical school and most large hospitals have labs with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machines. These can amplify tiny genetic pieces of the virus from nasal swabs to indicate a positive test. Batches of 200 tests can be completed in a few hours. We don\u2019t yet have commercially standardised \u201cprimers\u201d (tools used to find the viral genetic pieces) but, with authorisation from government, labs could develop their own to provide an adequate service for now. If power is devolved to local labs, our local authority outbreak teams could rapidly escalate testing.</p> <p>The announcement of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/uk-coronavirus-mass-home-testing-to-be-made-available-within-days\">mass home testing</a> in the UK is welcome. Around the world, companies are working frantically to develop diagnostic machines where people swabbing themselves can post samples to a lab. Others are using the Crispr-Cas9 genome editor to create a simple colour change on a test strip within 30 minutes. Either would be a game changer if they could be adopted at scale. People with symptoms would be able to self-isolate, identify contacts, report online to a national database, and the problem of mapping and rapidly quarantining those with coronavirus would be largely solved.</p> <p>Sadly, home testing won\u2019t prevent the deluge of cases facing the NHS in the next few weeks. But if the Imperial modellers are right and the epidemic returns after we achieve suppression, local authorities, using evidence from tests, could better control outbreaks and loosen the restrictions on our economy and our lives.</p> <p>\u2022 Anthony Costello is professor of global health and sustainable development at UCL and a former director of maternal and child health at the WHO</p>",

Staff in non-football departments are resigned to the probability they will be affected.</p> <p>The TV company that owns the rights to La Liga in Spain has announced it will apply temporary measures to more than 1,000 staff.</p> <p>Barcelona held remote meetings late last week and again on Tuesday. They had a positive response from the club captains. The proposal was for the reduction to last as long as the lockdown after which players would go back to earning 100% of their salary, even if competition does not return and the league remains unfinished. Spain\u2019s state of alarm was announced on 11 March and is set to continue until at least 11 April.</p> <p>Most Spanish football players earn a monthly salary, referred to as the <em>sueldo</em>, plus two larger annual payments six months apart known as the <em>ficha</em>. It is not clear whether the reduction would apply only to the <em>sueldo</em> or to the <em>ficha</em> as well. Four monthly payments remain outstanding this season.</p> <p>Barcelona\u2019s economic situation is precarious and there are concerns the club may not be able to meet some of their payments if the season is not completed. Of an annual budget of \u20ac1.047bn (\u00a3970m), 66% was spent on wages last season, down from 70% the season before but considered too high. The projection was 61% this season but that target is now unlikely to be met.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile the English Football League is working with the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association to determine a solution to financial matters, notably player wages.

  "<p>The speaker of Israel\u2019s Knesset has resigned after fierce criticism of his refusal to reopen parliament, which he suspended last week citing a ban of large gatherings while the country tackled the coronavirus.</p> <p>Yuli Edelstein \u2013 a close ally of Benjamin Netanyahu in the ruling Likud party \u2013 came under fire as the suspension was decried as an attempt to shield both him and the embattled prime minister.</p> <p>Opposition politicians accused Edelstein of using anti-democratic measures. Benny Gantz, Netanyahu\u2019s chief rival, had planned to gather enough lawmakers to oust Edelstein and elect a new speaker this week.</p> <p>While Netanyahu still heads an interim administration following an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/israels-opposition-head-benny-gantz-wins-support-to-form-government\">inconclusive 2 March election</a>, Gantz\u2019s Blue and White party, as well as other parliamentarians united against Netanyahu, hold a slim majority of 61 of 120 seats.</p> <p>Gantz also wanted the Knesset reopened to push through legislation that could end the 70-year-old prime minister\u2019s political career.</p> <p>Suggested Blue and White bills include limiting the prime ministerial tenure to two terms and ruling that ministers under indictment cannot hold office. Netanyahu would suffer from both laws \u2013 he has already served four terms and is facing trial for three separate corruption cases. He denies all accusations.</p> <p>On Monday, Israel\u2019s supreme court ordered Edelstein to reconvene the Knesset, which he rejected, raising fears of a potential constitutional crisis. Facing growing pressure, the speaker, who was in the job for seven years, made the shock announcement on Wednesday that he would resign instead, accusing the court of \u201ccrude and arrogant intervention\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAs a democrat, as a Zionist Jew, as someone who fought against dark regimes, and as the speaker of parliament, I consider the supreme court decision to be a grave, mistaken decision demonstrating a dangerous moral breakdown,\u201d he said, speaking in the Knesset.</p> <p>Under parliamentary regulations, Edelstein\u2019s resignation will only take effect in two days, probably postponing political battles into next week.</p> <p>Although Gantz is officially tasked with forming a government, it is not clear whether he will succeed in building a majority coalition by the mid-April deadline. His bloc is united by being largely anti-Netanyahu but includes Arab politicians who do not support Gantz, a former army chief.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Netanyahu has attempted to undercut his foe, calling for Gantz to join a unity administration led by him. \u201cBenny Gantz, this is a crucial time for national leadership and responsibility,\u201d Netanyahu tweeted on Tuesday. \u201cLet\u2019s meet now and set up a government.\u201d</p> <p>In power since 2009, Netanyahu has also been accused of exploiting the pandemic.

Shopping for essentials and food deliveries remained permitted.</p> <p>More than 2,000 cases of coronavirus infection have been confirmed in Israel, and five deaths reported.</p> <p>Hundreds of people have gathered outside the Knesset this week to protest against Edelstein and Netanyahu, although being careful to remain two metres apart. One demonstrator, Iris Fain, 58, described the former speaker as \u201cBibi\u2019s baby\u201d, using a nickname for the prime minister.</p> <p>Another, Guy Batler, 37, an architect from Tel Aviv, said as along as it remained legal to demonstrate \u2013 an activity still permitted under emergency Covid-19 measures \u2013 he would.</p> <p>\u201cWe are in a very dangerous situation in which, as part of the battle against the coronavirus, there are certain people who are trying to take advantage, and take powers that are not in their mandate.

  "<p>Crunch time should not be far away for the Open. The championship at Royal St George\u2019s is one of the precious few remaining on Britain\u2019s traditional summer sporting schedule. Should it fall victim to coronavirus \u2013 and the chances are strong \u2013 the R&amp;A will face a multi-layered problem: next year\u2019s Open is already earmarked for St Andrews, and what is meant to be the 150th staging of golf\u2019s oldest major.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/mar/21/ryder-cup-could-be-a-battle-between-a-dozen-captains-picks-apiece\">Ryder Cup could be a battle between a dozen captain's picks apiece | Ewan Murray</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Such decisions will follow a natural course. This enforced break in play, though, is a reminder of what the Open once was and has slipped away from as sport merged with high commerce.</p> <p>Just last week, Sky Sports filled time with wonderful reruns of Opens that would reel off the tongue of any golf historian. Tom Watson at Royal Troon, 1982; Seve Ballesteros, St Andrews 1984 and four years later at Royal Lytham &amp; St Annes; Greg Norman, Turnberry, 1986; Nick Faldo, Muirfield, 1987. Through unforeseen circumstance came an endearing visit to memory lane for viewers.</p> <p>The entirety of this sporting hiatus could be spent debating whether golf was better back then. Instantly noticeable was that Open venues did not have to be pristine. The links were left alone rather than micro-managed to the point of minimal impact.</p> <p>Frankly, this looked as if it was fun and authentic to thousands walking the fairways. There were grandstands, eventually, but not towering ones. The backdrop to the 18th green <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/21/shane-lowry-wins-open-2019-golf\" title=\"\">at Royal Portrush last summer</a>, of stands holding more than 4,000 spectators, resembled another planet when compared with Opens in the 1980s when the champions were generally illustrious.</p> <p>Portrush\u2019s aggregate attendance of more than 235,000 means the R&amp;A will sprint back to Northern Ireland as soon as the club\u2019s membership will tolerate the inconvenience. Last summer\u2019s was a decent Open that featured a runaway winner. That Portrush had not hosted the tournament since 1951 added gold dust that will be absent next time. Royal St George\u2019s in Sandwich, Kent has had ticket sales to have the R&amp;A salivating further.</p> <p>\u201cI have said a number of times I think that a big-time sport needs a big-time crowd,\u201d said Martin Slumbers, the R&amp;A\u2019s chief executive, last month. The benchmark has become 200,000 spectators. Slumbers is not prone to crass comment but by emphasising ticket sales as so significant he is subtly nudging esteemed venues into the background. That is a crying shame.</p> <p>The R&amp;A does plenty of good work for grassroots golf via funding but accelerating the cases of clubs on the Open pool on the basis of any \u201cProject 200,000\u201d looks tawdry.</p> <p>It is plausible both to recognise Muirfield\u2019s prehistoric approach to women, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/27/muirfield-golf-club-invite-women-join-first-time-275-year-history\" title=\"\">which was annulled only</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/27/muirfield-golf-club-invite-women-join-first-time-275-year-history\" title=\"\">last year</a>, and its place as arguably the finest course on the planet. On review of its membership policies, the East Lothian links was welcomed back into the Open fold but the wait will run from 2013 until at least 2024.</p> <p>Even that year feels a stretch if Portrush earns a swift second bite, before St Andrews reverts to five-year cycles in 2025. Muirfield was actually dealt a poor hand seven years ago, in what was the first instance of the R&amp;A refusing to offer concession tickets to senior citizens.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we are spending a lot of our time on is, how do we get 200,000 people around Muirfield?\u201d said Slumbers. \u201cHow do we get Muirfield to be Edinburgh\u2019s Open? How do we get Edinburgh city to embrace it and do that?\u201d A matter of weeks before the world\u2019s biggest arts festival, Edinburgh has other things on its mind, odd though it feels to link a city to the Open. The Masters does not run marketing campaigns in Augusta.

It is sad for the R&amp;A\u2019s corporate wing to accentuate ticket sales. Similar applies to Lytham, kicked into the long grass despite Ernie Els\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/22/open-2012-ernie-els\" title=\"\">sensational success of 2012</a>. Slumbers has previously branded the terrific Lancashire links as \u201ca bit tight\u201d, emphasising back-to-front logic.</p> <p>It is surely incumbent on the R&amp;A to utilise the finest courses, and regularly, whatever the infrastructure challenges. A glimmer of hope for Lytham resonates in consistency: 2026 will be the 100th anniversary of Bobby Jones\u2019s glory there. Americans will go wild for the historical reference point of Lytham\u2019s Open debut. Given Troon got the nod for 2023 because it marked 100 years since the Open first visited, Lytham should be treated on identical terms.</p> <p>Taking the R&amp;A at its word, Turnberry suffers by virtue of access and spectator figures; the broader picture there has never been appropriately addressed. Suffice to say when the renowned architect Martin Ebert oversaw fantastic changes to the venue now owned by the president of the United States an Open return was the carrot. Slumbers admitted \u201ca key issue\u201d with Turnberry is relatively low crowd numbers, yet in 2009 it hosted Watson\u2019s incredible brush with glory and, in 1977, the duel in the sun.</p> <p>The R&amp;A should be robust enough to manage reduced crowds when venues are so outstanding.

His first stage work included a contribution to a Broadway staging of The Lady of the Camellias in 1963, a full-length debut with And Things That Go Bump in the Night (1965) \u2013 a flop that gained McNally a certain notoriety with its monstrous family portrait and explicit gay seduction scene \u2013 a few one-act plays and, at last, a hit: The Ritz (1975), for which Rita Moreno won a Tony award for her performance as an over-the-top bathhouse singer, Googie Gomez, a sort of Latin American Bette Midler.</p> <p>McNally pointed to his Irish Catholic antecedents when discussing his heavy drinking during these years, though he finally quit alcohol completely in the mid-1980s. \u201cI never thought I wrote literature,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cI write plays for actors and I need actors I can trust.\u201d These included such elite names as Rivera, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/nathan-lane\" title=\"\">Nathan Lane</a>, Tyne Daly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/19/zoe-caldwell-obituary\" title=\"\">Zoe Caldwell</a>, Audra McDonald and Michael Shannon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1866b10a32eed71dd17efca7b6b08ff221d2d03c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1866b10a32eed71dd17efca7b6b08ff221d2d03c/0_486_2900_1739/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Terrence McNally in 1974.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Terrence McNally in 1974.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These last two starred in last year\u2019s Broadway revival of a 1987 two-hander, Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune, a barbed and feisty shake-down after a night in the sack for a waitress and a short-order cook in Hell\u2019s Kitchen (played superbly in London in 1989 by Julie Walters and Brian Cox). The show was a dramatic appendage, in a way, to The Rink (1984), McNally\u2019s first collaboration with Kander and Ebb, an embattled stand-off between a mother and daughter (Rivera and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/liza-minnelli\" title=\"\">Liza Minnelli</a>) in the nostalgic glow of a closing roller rink.</p> <p>The best song in The Rink was the stomping duet The Apple Doesn\u2019t Fall Very Far from the Tree, which summed up the show\u2019s theme, really. And it also indicated, said the New York Times, how McNally was moving from his default mode of the comedy of insult \u201cto a mature compassionate playwright increasingly aware of the ache in the human heart and the terrifying voids between people\u201d.</p> <p>Such was the general reaction to Love! Valour! Compassion! (1995), a spikily entertaining play directed by Joe Mantello which anatomised issues of love and happiness among eight gay men over three acts, set on Memorial Day, the Fourth of July, and Labor Day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1f7e0d70b1d42f5974e912be2c7e456703cb86f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1f7e0d70b1d42f5974e912be2c7e456703cb86f/0_350_1608_964/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edie Falco and Stanley Tucci in the Broadway revival of Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune in 2002.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edie Falco and Stanley Tucci in the Broadway revival of Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune in 2002.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Maxwell/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not that bitchy waspishness was absent from that piece any more than it was from two tribute plays to McNally\u2019s favourite operatic diva, Maria Callas, whom he loved for her unconventional voice and apparent dramatic spontaneity: The Lisbon Traviata (1985) in which two Callas devotees squabble over the singers and arias in their lives and loves; and Master Class (1996), starring Patti LuPone in the West End, a teaching session which Callas inevitably turns into a raucous exercise in self-justification.</p> <p>McNally found a new home from home in the Manhattan Theatre Club, New York\u2019s new plays factory.

For Anastasia (2017), McNally reunited with his Ragtime collaborators Flaherty and Ahrens on a retelling of the film about the lost Grand Duchess. For once, I felt McNally had hit upon material to which he was unsuited.</p> <p>His last and extended adventure was a version of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/15/theater/friedrich-durrenmatt-playwright-known-for-the-visit-dies-at-69.html\" title=\"\">Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt</a>\u2019s The Visit with Kander and Ebb, his last great effort for Rivera, born to play any musical version of the richest woman in the world, though the first casting idea was Angela Lansbury. But the project stuttered after several try-outs starting in Chicago in 2001 and ending, after just two months on Broadway, in 2015.

  "<p>An eerie quiet had descended over a city usually overflowing with chaos on Wednesday morning. As Delhi residents woke on the first day of a three-week nationwide lockdown imposed on India\u2019s population of 1.3 billion people in an attempt to halt the spread of the coronavirus, it was to a capital that was a ghost of its former self.</p> \n<p>Gone was the wall-to-wall traffic, the overcrowded alleyway fruit and vegetable markets, the auto-rickshaws, the chai wallahs, the <em>chaat</em> stalls, the bicycles piled high with wicker baskets and the overcrowded temples, mosques and gurdwaras. Highways were empty and roads lined with police and paramilitary officers and checkpoints. Chalk circles were drawn on the ground outside grocery shops and hospitals for people queuing to stand in to ensure they kept a healthy distance apart.</p> \n<p>Many also awoke to the reality of three weeks of hardship they were not sure they would be able to survive. More than 300 million people in India live below the poverty line, often living a hand to mouth existence as daily-wage workers with nothing in reserve to keep them going.</p> \n<p>Ram Yadav, 55, a rickshaw driver in north Delhi, lives in a room he shares with four others at a cost of 1,000 rupees (\u00a311) a month. He said he was overcome with anxiety at not being able to earn money for at least three weeks, if not more. \u201cI have to pay for my room, pay rent for my rickshaw, and I have family back home who are waiting for me to send money, but I don\u2019t know how I will do that and also survive.

The country has only 40,000 ventilators, one doctor per 11,600 people, one hospital bed per 1,826 people and one isolation bed per 84,000 people. The number of coronavirus cases is still low compared with Europe and the US, with just over 500 people infected and 10 deaths, but testing is also markedly behind other countries. Only about 17,000 tests have been carried out.</p> \n<p>\u201cIndia can not take any chances now,\u201d said Bhramar Mukherjee, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health who leads a team studying the spread of the coronavirus around the world. \u201cEven with the projected best-case scenarios, the already overstretched healthcare system will definitely collapse. There will be fatalities and deaths.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe need to increase testing, think of pragmatic surveillance strategies. We need to brace ourselves and prepare for a long haul.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But in a densely populated country where personal space is a luxury, the edict from the prime minister, Narendra Modi, calling for physical distancing and people to \u201cforget what going out means\u201d seemed like an almost impossible and unenforceable demand. Communal spaces form the basis of Indian society, three generations of a family tend to live together or next door, millions gather together in temples, mosques and gurdwaras on a daily basis and 64 million people live in overcrowded and insanitary slums.</p> \n<p>There are signs that India is already buckling under the weight of the increasing coronavirus caseload. A junior doctor in Kolkata who works in a state hospital where infected patients are being treated, and spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, said the four doctors in his hospital had been forced to work without the special personal protection equipment kits recommended by the World Health Organization because the authorities had not ordered them.</p> \n<p>\u201cLike many other doctor and paramedic colleagues and friends I worry that there is a high chance that I have already been infected and perhaps remained asymptomatic,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is extremely stressful for me while I am still working as a doctor among the patients.</p> \n<p>\u201cAfter working directly among the corona suspects I am sure of one thing, that unless the authorities bring more population under test we will not be able to curb or stop the spread of the infection. Lots of people who are potential carriers are not being tested even after they turned up at hospitals with some symptoms. Many others are not even reporting to the hospitals.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55be248e53a702e8733dd88a28f3290a2e17804e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55be248e53a702e8733dd88a28f3290a2e17804e/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Firefighters disinfect the grounds of a hospital in Mumbai\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Firefighters disinfect the grounds of a hospital in Mumbai.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Prashant Waydande/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was a similarly chaotic picture in the state of Bihar, which is dealing with around 50 coronavirus cases. Bihar also reported its first death at the weekend, a man who had recently returned from Qatar. Dr Ajay Kumar Bharti, the chief medical officer at Sadar hospital, where the man died, said they were ill-equipped to treat coronavirus patients safely. \u201cWe don\u2019t have surgical masks available right now and hence have ordered a local tailor shop to stitch 5,000 masks made of clothes and make them available soon,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Before lockdown was imposed, state borders began to close and India\u2019s railways, which usually carry 23 million passengers a day, shut down, tens of thousands of migrant workers returned to their villages from states such as Kerala and Maharashtra, the current centres of India\u2019s outbreak, raising fears of an already uncontrollable spread.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe available bed facility at government hospitals is not adequate,\u201d said the prominent Indian health expert Dr Rajiv Rajan. \u201cThe situation will turn alarming if we move into stage three and the patients start flooding the hospitals.\u201d</p> \n<p>For the people of Jammu and Kashmir however, Modi\u2019s announcement on Tuesday evening was met with a familiar dread and panic. Lockdowns have long been part of their way of life and since Modi revoked the state\u2019s special status last October and split it in two, they have endured a six-month crackdown which has crippled many essential services, including healthcare.</p> \n<p>As a result, Kashmir\u2019s healthcare system does not have enough manpower or machinery to deal with the outbreak. The state\u2019s doctor-patient ratio is the lowest in India, it is severely short of nurses and has only about 100 ventilators for a population of more than 12 million.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat we are doing are preventive measures just to control and isolate the virus,\u201d said a doctor at a major trauma care hospital in Srinagar. \u201cGod forbid if we get a lot of cases or seriously sick patients. We will saturate in a matter of hours.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have a few ventilators, only at maximum 50 to 100, and they are already occupied.

  "<p>The government\u2019s decision to cooperate with US authorities over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/jul/24/uk-may-face-legal-challenge-over-us-extradition-of-isis-pair\">prosecution of two alleged Islamic State executioners</a> without assurances that they would not face the death penalty was unlawful, the supreme court has ruled.</p> <p>In a unanimous judgment that will have repercussions for US-UK relations, the court\u2019s seven justices said the home secretary\u2019s agreement to provide evidence about El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey breached data protection rules.</p> <p>Delivering the judgment, Lord Kerr said that under the Data Protection Act transferring information in this context was contrary to law. He said: \u201cMuch of the information provided, or to be provided, to the US authorities consisted of personal data. It was common ground between the parties that provision of mutual legal assistance involved the \u2018processing\u2019 of such personal data falling within part 3 [of the] Data Protection Act.</p> <p>\u201cSuch processing is only lawful where it complies with the data protection principles in section 34 DPA. I concluded that since the transfer of material to the US authorities without obtaining death penalty assurances was contrary to law, it followed that the first and second principles \u2013 requiring processing that is lawful and fair \u2013 were not met.\u201d</p> <p>Elsheikh and Kotey, who were raised in Britain, are alleged to have been part of an Isis terrorist cell, some of whom were known as \u201cthe Beatles\u201d, that is thought to have carried out 27 beheadings of US and UK citizens in Isis-held territory. Those killed included the British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines and the American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff.</p> <p>The pair, who have been stripped of their British citizenship, were captured in February 2018 by Syrian Kurdish fighters, prompting behind-the-scenes negotiations between the UK and US governments over where they should be prosecuted.</p> <p>The decision not to seek assurances from the US that the two men would not face the death penalty was in defiance of advice from the Foreign Office and senior civil servants, the courts were told by lawyers for Maha Elgizouli, Elsheikh\u2019s mother.</p> <p>In 2018 it emerged that the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, had written to the US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, telling him that the UK \u201cdoes not currently intend to request, nor actively encourage,\u201d the transfer of Kotey and Elsheikh to Britain and there were \u201cstrong reasons for not requiring a death penalty assurance in this specific case\u201d.</p> <p>Elgizouli\u2019s lawyers, Birnberg Peirce solicitors, said: \u201cMs Elgizouli thanks the court for its careful consideration of her appeal and recognises the difficult issues it raises. She has always expressed her belief that her son, if accused, should face justice, and that any trial should take place in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cShe has been asking since November 2018 for the CPS to conduct a review of the claim that there was insufficient evidence for him to be charged and tried in the UK \u2013 a review that the CPS now says should be completed by April 2020.\u201d</p> <p>In the judgment, Lady Hale, who has since retired as the court\u2019s president, declared: \u201cThe most fundamental of the rights protected by the European convention [on human rights] is the right to life. This is an absolute right, not qualified by the possibility of restrictions or interferences which are \u2018necessary in a democratic society\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Kerr\u2019s judgement went even further, asserting: \u201cI believe that the time has arrived where a common law principle should be recognised whereby it is deemed unlawful to facilitate the trial of any individual in a foreign country where, to do so, would put that person in peril of being executed.\u201d</p> <p>Reprieve, an organisation that campaigns against the death penalty, intervened in the supreme court case. Its director, Maya Foa, welcomed what she called a landmark judgment. </p> <p>\u201cBy sharing information without first seeking - and securing - assurances that the death penalty wouldn\u2019t be in play, this government acted unlawfully,\u201d she said. \u201cIn doing so they undermined the UK\u2019s strong assistance for people facing capital punishment across the globe, and so put hundreds of lives at risk.\u201d</p> <p>The supreme court judgment was read out by Kerr over a videolink. The court building is closed during the coronavirus pandemic crisis but it is continuing to hear cases remotely.</p> <p>Shami Chakrabarti, the shadow attorney general, said: \u201cThose understandably concerned about the sweeping powers that parliament has just temporarily handed to the executive to cope with the coronavirus emergency, will take some comfort from the watchful eye of the UK\u2019s judges and the value they so obviously place on the right to life.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe government\u2019s priority has always been to maintain national security and to deliver justice for the victims and their families. This has not changed. We are clearly very disappointed with today\u2019s judgment and are carefully considering next steps.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Virtual reality and the Half-Life series have both struggled with the weight of expectations put upon them. Half-Life and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2009/dec/16/games-events2\">its sequel</a> are treasured games that each redefined the first-person shooter in their own ways. Yet developer Valve Software has left Half-Life\u2019s story unfinished for 13 years, recently admitting that previous attempts to continue it were, in its own view, not good enough.</p> <p>VR, meanwhile, offers the promise of unparalleled immersion, the ability to let players perceive virtual environments and touch objects as if they were present in the real world. But factors such as high price points, complex setups and the physical demands of playing have seen the tech struggle to bring that magic to the mainstream.</p> <p>Now, Valve has attempted to solve both problems at once, creating a new Half-Life game <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/nov/19/new-half-life-sequel-vr-exclusive-htc-vive-headset\">designed specifically for VR</a>.

You also don\u2019t play as the series protagonist Gordon Freeman, but as his Half-Life 2 companion Alyx Vance. In this prequel, Alyx is a 19-year-old rebel fighting a guerrilla war against a force of alien invaders known as the Combine.</p> <p>The game opens with a breathtaking demonstration of VR\u2019s ability to represent scale. Performing reconnaissance for the rebels, Alyx stands atop a balcony overlooking the rooftops of City 17 \u2013 a sweeping vista of pastel-coloured townhouses sitting in the cobalt-blue shadow of the Combine\u2019s towering citadel. The introduction also lets you dabble with a VR-unique control system, twiddling with radios and writing with felt-tip pens on windows before getting to the heart of the matter.

A pair of gravity gloves enable her to move objects with a flick of the wrist, which can then be caught mid-air by pressing the controller\u2019s grip buttons. Alongside this, Alyx has a remote device for hacking electrical systems, and several weapons that must all be handled, aimed, and reloaded using virtual hands.</p> <p>Much of this is familiar territory for VR applications, although Valve imbues each component with its trademark slick efficiency. What makes Alyx special is a more general symbiosis between the technology and the Half-Life universe. VR adds so much texture to City 17 and its motley inhabitants. This is shown in striking fashion by the headcrabs, Half-Life\u2019s scuttling aliens who leap at your face. In previous Half-Life games, these critters were little more than crowbar fodder. Here, you get a palpable sense of their weight and power, how those leathery limbs and twitching mandibles could crack a human skull like a combination safe.</p> <p>Speaking of cracking things, VR adds tactile detail to the Combine\u2019s strange technology. Many terminals you come across are protected by holographic security systems that can be manipulated with virtual hands. These hacking puzzles make fantastic use of VR tech, although one could argue Alyx\u2019s designers are overly fond of obstructing your progress with them.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2W0N3uKXmo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O2W0N3uKXmo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>As for what Half-Life brings to VR, how does structure, pacing, narrative, character, dazzling set-pieces and frantic action sound? Like all of the Half-Life games, each of Alyx\u2019s 11 chapters has a distinct theme, whether it\u2019s exploring a dilapidated hotel infested by alien spores, or battling Combine soldiers through the chimney stacks and brick warehouses of City 17\u2019s industrial district. The game sports a remarkable tonal range. At several points it becomes an outright survival horror, with Alyx battling zombies and headcrabs in the cramped darkness of the city\u2019s sewers and subways. But Alyx and her comm-linked companion Russell lend levity to even the darkest moments, via first-rate voice acting and a script packed with genuinely funny jokes.</p> <p>Valve\u2019s debut VR game (after years of enticing demos) is a showcase of how to use this tech for long-form narratives and it\u2019s a scintillating new entry in the Half-Life series. It may not be exactly the Half-Life game fans hoped for, lacking that all-important \u201c3\u201d on the end. But from Left 4 Dead to Portal, Valve is a master at giving players games they didn\u2019t know they wanted \u2013 Half-Life: Alyx is another example of that ability to surprise, delight and innovate.</p>",
  "<p>The first movie of the coronaviral era is already here. Domains, from Japanese film-maker Natsuka Kusano, premiered last year at the Rotterdam film festival, so it was conceived and made well before the outbreak. But with eerie relevance, it speaks to the spirit of our times, featuring sparsely populated or empty streets, characters who always stay a few feet apart, who don\u2019t touch and rarely speak face-to-face, and in any case only with a weird dislocation and alienation. There\u2019s a character who objects to the isolation in which another character appears to be locking down his family and demands to know if this man considers her a \u201cvirus\u201d who has to be kept well away. In her own domain, in fact.</p> <p>Along with many others recently, I\u2019ve been curating lists of feelgood movies to keep everyone cheerful \u2013 and we\u2019re all tweeting merrily about how odd it is to see people in films recklessly hugging and wantonly touching each other. Feelgood anthologising is an entirely valid cinephile activity. Who knows how vital a global resource it may yet turn out to be as the months stretch ahead? Yet, however intensely non-fun this particular movie is, it\u2019s a relief to engage with a type of cinema that presents itself as something other than a comfort blanket.</p> <p>Domains is a stark, experimental chamber piece, directed by Kusano and written by Tomoyuki Takahashi (who worked on Ry\u00fbsuke Hamaguchi\u2019s film Happy Hour) with a self-deconstructing self-awareness that feels like something from the French New Wave. The title evidently echoes the 1956 exhibition of the same name from Japanese photographer Ikko Narahara.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0AXSfYJ8a4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l0AXSfYJ8a4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>We start in a police station where one character is confessing to a murder, and doing so with deliberative calmness, making it clear that this was no accident. From there we flash back to scenes involving three people affected by the crime. Aki (Asami Shibuya) is a single woman taking a break from her job in publishing due a breakdown that is never entirely specified. She has recently reconnected with her old schoolfriend, Nodoka (Tomo Kasajima), who is now married to a cold, controlling and abusive man called Naoto (Tomomitsu Adachi); they have a small daughter, Honoka. The two women are galvanised by the revival of shared girlhood memories, but their intimacy deeply irritates the charmless Naoto, and he is infuriated when his wife lets Aki buy presents for Honoka; he blames this interloper for getting Honoka feverishly overexcited and ill. Soon he demands that his wife shuns her.</p> <p>But this is not shown straight: we simply see the actors rehearsing the scenes, mostly with the script in front of them. The same scenes are played over and over again, with changes in emphasis and intonation and camera placement, and very occasionally new lines are included, with the director occasionally heard, off-camera, though never seen.</p> <p>The effect is unexpected. The endless Groundhog Day repetition of these moments \u2013 key \u201cprologue\u201d scenes to the crime \u2013 has the effect of magnifying the scenes and rendering them more amenable to scrutiny. It allows us, the audience, to examine them, to pick them apart. But to what end? Again and again, the question of motive will come up in our minds, just as it does in the characters\u2019. Yet motive always remains opaque.</p> <p>And what is happening in these enigmatic \u201crehearsal\u201d scenes anyway? Are we seeing the characters themselves, trying to engage with their own past, like Pirandellian figures adrift in a play whose meaning they can\u2019t work out? Do they go through these scenes repeatedly, the way all of us can listlessly go over painful memories, trying to make sense of them, get to the truth of them like a cop or a judge, actually trying to knead them into blankness so they are bearable?</p> <p>At the beginning, we will see the police officer (in that initial \u201creal\u201d scene) reading back the confession statement in precisely the same unengaged tone that everyone else is to use. This police transcript appears to have the same status as the film script. It is the official document, which appears to give a black-and-white fixity and meaning to inchoate events. But this meaning is elusive.</p> <p>Domains speaks of unease, emotional containment, the societal need to carry on and the fear of something growing out of control. \u201cBe careful,\u201d says Naoto to his cowed wife about Aki, \u201cor her influence is going to spread.\u201d Troubling though it is to say right now, this film is about a suppressed dread of something fatal just around the corner.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/domains\">Domains is streaming on Mubi</a>.</p>",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Another doctor, Charles from west Africa, who did complete the medical conversion exams and is practising in the UK, is doing research into some aspects of Covid-19 with colleagues in the US. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at trying to prevent some of the complications of Covid-19 such as lung fibrosis,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>He added that part of the GMC conversion exams for overseas doctors known as <a href=\"https://www.gmc-uk.org/registration-and-licensing/join-the-register/plab\">Plab 1 and Plab 2</a> \u2013 Professional and Linguistic Assessment Board \u2013 focus on the nuances of the English language rather than on medical expertise. They cost \u00a3230 and \u00a3840 respectively, and courses medics must take before sitting these exams can cost in the region of \u00a32,000 and upwards.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was listening to the BBC 24/7 to perfect my English language to pass these exams,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was about techniques, about playing the game.

They are able and willing to play their part in tackling this pandemic,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThe veto on asylum seekers working is outrageous. If we have asylum seekers who are qualified doctors why not bring them forward?\u201d</p> \n<p>Anna Jones of <a href=\"https://refuaid.org\">RefuAid</a>, which supports refugee healthcare specialists and other professionals into employment with loans for accredition and other things, has called on Hancock to fast-track fully qualified overseas doctors and nurses into NHS jobs.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have 230 doctors who are fully qualified in their own countries. Most have many years of experience as doctors. It can take these doctors 12 to 18 months to get their language qualifications and their Plab 1 and Plab 2 qualifications,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cA lot of these doctors have clinical experience in high-pressure, low-resource settings. I can understand that it\u2019s important to ensure that people\u2019s medical qualifications are legitimate. We have obtained copies of the doctors\u2019 qualifications from their home countries.\u201d</p> \n<p>Una Lane, the director for registration at the GMC, said: \u201cWe\u2019re working hard to help qualified doctors join the frontline to provide vital care to patients.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have always worked closely with refugee doctors and their representative organisations to help them register with us so that they can practise here and care for patients in the UK. We are continuing to do this but are also pointing them to advice from NHS England about roles that they could undertake that would not require registration or a licence to practise in the short term.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cRefugee doctors are eligible for discounts. We cover the fees for EPIC verification and offer two free attempts at Plab 1, with Plab 2 discounted to half price. The application fee can be paid in 10 instalments if requested.\u201d</p> \n<p>A government spokesperson said<strong>: </strong>\u201cWe are hugely grateful for the vital contributions that doctors are making in the national effort to tackle coronavirus, and are considering a wide range of further measures, at pace, as part of our response. There are no immigration checks for anyone requiring testing or treatment and they will be treated for free.\u201d</p>",

The government has called on fit and healthy adults to sign up as NHS volunteer responders to help up to to 1.5 million vulnerable people confined to their homes for three months.</p> \n<p>Here\u2019s what we know so far about the NHS volunteer scheme and how it will work.</p> \n<h2><strong>Who is being asked to join?</strong></h2> \n<p>People aged 18 and over and in good health \u2013 and without coronavirus symptoms \u2013 are being asked to sign up online to help ensure vulnerable people confined to their homes get the essential supplies they need and to provide other support to the NHS. Volunteers must pass an enhanced DBS check.</p> \n<h2><strong>How can I apply to volunteer?</strong></h2> \n<p>People can sign up <a href=\"https://www.goodsamapp.org/NHS\">here</a>.</p> \n<h2><strong>What roles can volunteers play?</strong></h2> \n<p>Volunteers can help in four roles. They can become a community response volunteer, which involves \u201ccollecting shopping, medication or other essential supplies for someone who is self-isolating, and delivering these supplies to their home.\u201d Patient transport volunteers will support the NHS by driving discharged patients to their homes, and NHS transport volunteers will move equipment, supplies or medication between sites. Check-in and chat volunteers will provide regular support calls to elderly people who are in isolation and at risk of loneliness.</p> \n<h2><strong>How will it work in practice?</strong></h2> \n<p>Volunteers will be directed to tasks via an app through which they can say they are \u201con duty\u201d and available. <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/2020/03/your-nhs-needs-you-nhs-call-for-volunteer-army/\">NHS England\u2019s website states</a>: \u201cGPs, doctors, pharmacists, nurses, midwives, NHS 111 advisers and social care staff will all be able to request help for their at-risk patients via a call centre run by the Royal Voluntary Service (RVS), who will match people who need help with volunteers who live near to them.

The new voluntary scheme is not intended to replace local ones but to provide additional support to the NHS.</p> \n<h2><strong>Won\u2019t </strong><strong>volunteers be breaking government instructions to stay at home</strong><strong>?</strong></h2> \n<p>In short, no. Asked if the scheme went against advice to stay at home and how the government would keep volunteers safe, Robert Jenrick, the housing and communities secretary, told BBC Breakfast on Wednesday morning: \u201cThe government\u2019s guidance is to stay at home unless you\u2019ve got a reason to be going out. If you\u2019re doing something absolutely essential for fighting the virus, like volunteering in this very organised way, then obviously that\u2019s different. But we want to keep those individuals safe. They\u2019ll receive the training, the support and the equipment that they\u2019ll need to carry out those roles.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Who else is helping the NHS?</strong></h2> \n<p>Nearly 12,000 recently retired NHS staff members have also come forward to rejoin the frontline following a separate call for help. The government has announced plans to set up a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/nhs-plans-to-turn-excel-centre-into-coronavirus-hospital\">makeshift hospital</a> with capacity for up to 4,000 beds at the ExCeL centre in east London.</p> \n<h2><strong>How many people have volunteered? </strong></h2> \n<p>More than 500,000 volunteers have signed up so far.

  "<p>\u201cI am a man I never had time to get to know,\u201d announces the film-maker John Boorman, director of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/17/point-blank-crime\" title=\"\">Point Blank</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/17/point-blank-crime\" title=\"\"> (1967)</a> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/19/deliverance-boorman-action\" title=\"\">Deliverance</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/19/deliverance-boorman-action\" title=\"\"> (1972)</a>, halfway through this not-quite memoir. \u201cI suspected he was a fraud, a liar, full of hollow passion, best kept locked away.\u201d It\u2019s a pensive, unexpectedly self-chastening admission in a section titled \u201cSolitude\u201d. Mulling a little longer, he adds: \u201cI can\u2019t say I like him, but since it is just the two of us, we are learning to get along. I have even found it possible to forgive him. He no longer embarrasses me, nor do I feel the need to apologise for him.\u201d</p> <p>Why, one wonders, would Boorman ever have been embarrassed by himself? Born in Carshalton, south London in 1933, he left school at 16 and worked for a dry-cleaners, but was soon writing essays for the Manchester Guardian and as a critic for BBC Radio\u2019s<em> Under-Twenty Review</em> show. During national service the lectures he gave to Korea-bound troops on the background to the war inspired one of them, Labour MP Ian Mikardo\u2019s son, to declare he couldn\u2019t serve in such an immoral struggle. Boorman was arrested and charged with \u201cseducing a soldier from the course of his duty\u201d, only for the court martial against him to be dropped when it became clear that the chief source for his seditious propaganda was the Times.</p> <p>Boorman\u2019s previous book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/sep/13/film.highereducation\" title=\"\">Adventures of a Suburban Boy</a></em> (2003) was a more linear account of his directorial career that included not only his notable successes but the box-office catastrophe <em>Exorcist II</em> (1977). <em>Conclusions</em> is more fragmented, a commonplace book that includes advice for budding screenwriters; tributes to the BBC where, as a young documentarian, he was given freedom to experiment and to \u201cpaint with light\u201d; and fond recollections of the characters he has encountered in his years living in Ireland (among them a \u201cpoetic conman\u201d with the splendid name Shit Mackey).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c93494704f64079976271ef7d60c0e2cd94ee955\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c93494704f64079976271ef7d60c0e2cd94ee955/0_0_2975_3000/992.jpg\" alt=\"Burt Reynolds in Deliverance (1972).\" width=\"992\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Burt Reynolds in <em>Deliverance</em> (1972).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The chapters teem with gossipy though never mean anecdotes. He recalls the 1992 Cannes film festival where he often had to shake and sometimes punch Gerard Depardieu who, even though he was jury president, habitually fell asleep and started snoring as soon as the lights went down on the films being screened in competition. He marvels at how the famously bibulous John Hurt managed to win a best dramatic actor award in spite of the fact that \u201che had not read the script, did not know the name of the character he was playing, or even the name of the film\u201d in which he had appeared.</p> <p>Some of his stories can be unexpectedly moving. Burt Reynolds, shortly after he appeared in Cosmopolitan as a nude centrefold, confessed to him that he felt awkward about his new-found sex-symbol status. \u201cHe told me that women expected something amazing from their experiences with him. \u2018But,\u2019 he said ruefully, \u2018I\u2019m just a fumbler like everyone else.\u2019\u201d David Lean confides in him: \u201c\u2018The tragedy of my life is that I always took the women who wanted me. I never had the courage to go after the women I wanted.\u2019 \u2018Does that apply to all five wives?\u2019 I said. \u2018Absolutely,\u2019 he replied morosely.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Best of all is his account of Harold Pinter\u2019s vanity and insecurity about his poetry. Every time it appeared in the Observer he would buy a bundle of copies and send them to friends who were expected to tell him how great they found the verse. On one occasion, Pinter sent a two-line poem to the playwright Simon Gray. (\u201cI saw Len Hutton in his prime / Another time, another time.\u201d) Not getting any reply, he rang Gray and asked him if he\u2019d received the poem. And then: \u201cDid you read it?\u201d \u201cI am only halfway through it,\u201d Gray replied.</p> <p>For all its gaiety, <em>Conclusions</em> is permeated with loss and a sense of time running out. Boorman notes the death of friends and conspirators such as Ken Russell and John Schlesinger. And words, the right words, increasingly elude him: \u201cIf I wait patiently, they float up, and I recapture them.\u201d Nature is a partial solace. He includes his own poetry \u2013 about larches, oak trees, water \u2013 some of which is accompanied by hand-drawn sketches. The bigger loss, to which he often returns with eloquence and insight \u2013 is film itself. He mourns the shift to digital (\u201cdirt and scratches on the screen are a thing of the past\u201d), film\u2019s shrinkage from big screens to laptops and smartphone, and the damage done to narrative structures by TV programmes financed by streaming platforms: \u201cMovies are always seeking endings that grow out of the body of the story, that are earned and satisfying, whereas the series is searching for material that will let it continue. It must avoid endings at all costs.\u201d The feature film, he believes, \u201cis a director\u2019s medium; the TV series is usually dictated by a producer or, as they are now called, a show runner \u2026 I find the results tedious, the obligations to watch a chore.\u201d</p> <p>In the end, what makes <em>Conclusions</em> so delightful is Boorman\u2019s awareness of how absurd cinema is.

  "<p>The mobile phone industry has explored the creation of a global data-sharing system that could track individuals<strong> </strong>around the world, as part of an effort to curb the spread of Covid-19.</p> \n<p>The Guardian has learned that a senior official at GSMA, an international standard-setting body for the mobile phone industry, held discussions with at least one company that is capable of tracking individuals globally through their mobile devices, and discussed the possible creation of a global data-sharing system.</p> \n<p>Any move to create such a global tracking system would represent a major escalation in efforts to use mobile phone location data to help stem the pandemic, and would be likely to raise concerns among privacy and security experts.</p> \n<p>Until now the use of mobile phone tracking in the fight against Covid-19 has been restricted to national governments, which are either monitoring data within their borders or in discussions with mobile operators and technology companies about doing so.</p> \n<p>They include the US, India, Iran, Poland, Singapore, Israel and South Korea. The British government is engaged in talks with BT, the owner of the UK mobile operator EE, about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/plan-phone-location-data-assist-uk-coronavirus-effort\">using phone location and usage data</a> to determine the efficacy of isolation orders.</p> \n<p>The concept of an international mobile tracing scheme would go further, enabling authorities to monitor movements and potentially track the spread of the disease across borders. The GSMA represents the interests of 750 mobile phone operators and vendors across the world and helps set international standards for companies.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A person familiar with its exploratory talks said they were at an early stage and that decisions had not yet been made about whether to move ahead with the plan. The aim of such a global network would be to enact \u201ccontact tracing\u201d, enabling authorities to use mobile location data to track who a person infected with Covid-19 may have come in contact with.</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for GSMA strenuously denied it was currently involved in any project to create a global tracking system. \u201cWe are not involved in a project of this nature,\u201d the GSMA spokesperson said. However the GSMA also said it would not comment on discussions that had taken place or ideas that were being explored.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn this emergency situation, the GSMA and its members are doing everything they can to help the global fight against Covid-19,\u201d Mats Granryd, the director of the GSMA, said in a statement emailed to the Guardian. \u201cWe are engaging with operators, policymakers and international organisations around the world to explore viable mobile big data and AI solutions to fight this pandemic while adhering to principles of privacy and ethics.\u201d</p> \n<p>Advocates of using mobile phone technology in medical emergencies say accurate and up-to-date information can be a vital tool.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/17/white-house-location-data-coronavirus/\">Washington Post reported last week </a>that the US government was in active talks with Facebook, Google and other tech companies and health experts about how location data from Americans\u2019 phones could be used to fight the pandemic. The report suggested public health experts were interested in anonymous aggregate data that could help map the spread of the virus.</p> \n<p>The emergency measures <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/israel-to-track-mobile-phones-of-suspected-coronavirus-cases\">approved by the Israeli government last week</a> go further, enabling authorities to track individual people suspected or confirmed to have been infected to notify individuals who may have come into contact with them. They also allow phones to be used to enforce strict quarantine rules.</p> \n<p>The proposed UK scheme would involve anonymised mobile phone data being used to monitor whether coronavirus limitation measures such as asking the public to stay at home are working. It could also be used to send health alerts. While the information provided on geographical movement would be delayed by 12 to 24 hours, British privacy campaigners have raised concerns over the scheme, calling for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/uk-privacy-activists-raise-fears-social-distancing-tracking-coronavirus\">\u201cradical transparency\u201d</a> in the way the government uses mobile data.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/world\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>One telecommunications expert, who spoke to the Guardian on the condition of anonymity, said GSMA would be capable of creating a global data-sharing network if mobile operators around the world agreed to share usage information. That data would then be used to help authorities visualise the spread of the disease, or to track individual subscribers to perform \u201ccontact tracing\u201d, using an individual\u2019s location to detect how the disease might spread.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-map-how-covid-19-cases-are-spreading-across-the-world\">Coronavirus map: how Covid-19 cases are spreading across the world</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>David Kaye, a UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression, said it was not necessarily a bad thing for governments to use technology as a means to help control the virus. But he said there were important rule of law standards that had to be taken into account if emergency measures were put in place, including the possible tracking of individuals by mobile phone companies.</p> \n<p>He said these included alerting individuals whose data was being tracked, being fully transparent about the data collection and subjecting any such initiatives to judicial oversight. He also said there should be sunset provisions in place and continuously reviewed so that emergency measures did not become permanent.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen I think about how these tools can be helpful, making sure they are adhering to basic standards is really important,\u201d Kaye said.</p>",

The Germans arrived in the semis after dispatching a Roma side led by a future England manager (Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson) and captained by a future Everton manager (Carlo Ancelotti). On the pitch at Goodison Lerby was joined in midfield by Lothar Matth\u00e4us in an unflinching head to head with Peter Reid and Paul Bracewell.

Yet back in 82, the frontman of the fecund Salford post-punk outfit titled the band\u2019s fourth studio album to be an induction into their world; to place listeners under their spell. While previous albums had ranged from amphetamine-charged rockabilly to deconstructed avant-punk, Smith knew the band had stumbled into new terrain here \u2013 deeming it a year zero moment.</p> <p>The beginning of the band\u2019s double-drummer period was one such key evolution, with Karl Burns and Paul Hanley crashing into and around one another with deftness and discordance. Smith claims he instructed the band to play out of time, to distort thinking around conventional musical structures, and the result is an album that exists in a constant state of push-pull dynamism.</p> <p>With recording taking place between a disused cinema in Hertfordshire and a studio normally used for folk music in Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland, there\u2019s a deliberate lo-fidelity quality, an antithetical statement to the increasingly slick production techniques of the day. The album ricochets between moments of crisp hyper-tautness to frenzied, unravelling laxity. Tonally, it\u2019s raw and serrated, with Steve Hanley\u2019s corkscrewing bass lines as twisting and piercing as Smith\u2019s venomous and intractable vocals. It\u2019s the sound of a band consumed by momentum and driven by an obdurate vision \u2013 but nonplussed by imperfections that arise along the way. Tracks such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-EUKdn1FEk\">Hip Priest</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uc1CpSuo4VQ\">And This Day</a> are considered, but move in such gloriously erratic bursts that they could be based on the musical pattern you\u2019d get from hurling a piano down a flight of stairs.</p> <p>Lyrically, it\u2019s as surreal as it is sniping and satirical, with Smith exhausted by the \u201cshit of the times\u201d such as \u201cbland bastards like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/elviscostello\">Elvis Costello</a> and Spandau Ballet\u201d, claiming he\u2019d \u201crather listen to the Polish builders clanking away next door than any of that crap\u201d. Almost 40 years on, it retains that all-or-nothing spirit, losing none of its unrelenting charge while occasionally sounding just like builders clanking away next door. Smith\u2019s supposedly ironic use of a racial epithet on The Classical has dated far worse, and stands out more than ever as a regrettable blip on an otherwise unspoiled album.</p> <h2>The three albums to check out next</h2> <p><strong>Perverted by Language (1983)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMJJmdlZoPw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OMJJmdlZoPw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The story goes that when John Peel heard album opener <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMkKqD6sbec\">Eat Y\u2019Self Fitter</a> for the first time, he fainted and had to be resuscitated. The urgent, incessant, yet strangely buoyant bassline that runs through it is certainly one that rattles around the head to dizzying degrees. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMJJmdlZoPw\">Garden</a>, meanwhile, finds Smith spouting obliquely as the band build, creep and crash around him during a nine-minute album opus of jagged, slow-burn post-punk. It\u2019s a record filled with such snap-and-release moments \u2013 surging eruptions springing from highly coiled restraint \u2013 such as the expulsions of Smile, with Smith yelping like a feral creature.</p> <p><strong>This Nation\u2019s Saving Grace (1985)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijuJhyUfhDQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ijuJhyUfhDQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>One of the Fall\u2019s more melodic offerings, a position commonly attributed to the contributions of Smith\u2019s then-wife <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/01/brix-smith-start-interview-rise-fall-rise-mark-e-smith-nigel-kennedy-philip-start-the-extricated\">Brix Smith Start</a>. The slimming down to one drummer again leaves more focus for the spiralling dual guitars of Craig Scanlon and Smith Start, which weave between infectious melody and the band\u2019s more typically gritty and sinewy tone.

For electricity production, 35% is from natural gas, 27% is from coal, 19% is from nuclear and 17% is from renewable energy (hydropower, wind, biomass and solar), according to the Energy Information Administration.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The virus outbreak could slow construction of energy projects in line with an economy-wide slowdown in manufacturing and infrastructure development, but the council believes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/mar/25/market-us-covid-19-stimulus-deal-uk-inflation-retail-sales-ftse-business\">Covid-19</a> could still present an opportunity for the wind industry.</p> \n<p>The council said the outbreak could prove to be an economic watershed, and it urged governments to use the growing industry to help galvanise economic recovery.</p> \n<p>The call echoes a warning from the boss of the International Energy Agency, Dr Fatih Birol, that the virus could undermine progress in clean energy development unless governments <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/12/coronovirus-poses-threat-to-climate-action-says-watchdog\">use green investments to help support economic growth</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have an important window of opportunity,\u201d Birol said. \u201cMajor economies around the world are preparing stimulus packages. A well-designed stimulus package could offer economic benefits and facilitate a turnover of energy capital which have huge benefits for the clean energy transition.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ben Backwell, the chief executive of GWEC, said global clean energy growth <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/11/clean-energy-investment-falls-back-to-2016-levels-amid-policy-uncertainty\">is not where it needs to be</a> to help keep global temperatures in check as part of the Paris climate accord.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we are to have any chance at reaching our Paris agreement objectives and remaining on a 1.5C pathway, we need to be installing at least 100GW of wind energy per year, and this needs to rise to 200GW per year and beyond,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The council had expected that global wind power installations would rise by 76GW this year but will offer a new forecast in the second quarter of the year that takes into account the impact of the coronavirus.</p>",

  "<p>When, along with applied systems scientist Dr Joe Norman, we first reacted to coronavirus on 25 January with the publication of an academic note urging caution, the virus had reportedly infected fewer than 2,000 people worldwide and fewer than 60 people were dead. That number need not have been so high.</p> <p>At the time of writing, the numbers are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance-mar-23\">351,000 and 15,000 respectively</a>. Our research did not use any complicated model with a vast number of variables, no more than someone watching an avalanche heading in their direction calls for complicated statistical models to see if they need to get out of the way.</p> <p>We called for a simple exercise of the precautionary principle in a domain where it mattered: interconnected complex systems have some attributes that allow some things to cascade out of control, delivering extreme outcomes. Enact robust measures that would have been, at the time, of small cost: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/24/uk-lockdown-gove-tries-to-clarify-confusion-over-rules\">constrain mobility</a>. Immediately. Later, we invoked a rapid investment in preparedness: tests, hospital capacity, means to treat patients. Just in case, you know. Things can happen.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/23/europe-views-uk-coronavirus-plan-disbelief\">error in the UK</a> is on two levels. Modelling and policymaking.</p> <p>First, at the modelling level, the government relied at all stages on epidemiological models that were designed to show us roughly what happens when a preselected set of actions are made, and not what we <em>should</em> make happen, and how.</p> <p>The modellers use hypotheses/assumptions, which they then feed into models, and use to draw conclusions and make policy recommendations. Critically, they do not produce an error rate. What if these assumptions are wrong? Have they been tested? The answer is often no. For academic papers, this is fine. Flawed theories can provoke discussion. Risk management \u2013 like wisdom \u2013 requires robustness in models.</p> <p>But if we base our pandemic response plans on flawed academic models, people die. And they will.<br><br>This was the case with the disastrous \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/herd-immunity-will-the-uks-coronavirus-strategy-work\">herd immunity</a>\u201d thesis. The idea behind herd immunity was that the outbreak would stop if enough people got sick and gained immunity. Once a critical mass of young people gained immunity, so the epidemiological modellers told us, vulnerable populations (old and sick people) would be protected. Of course, this idea was nothing more than a dressed-up version of the \u201cjust do nothing\u201d approach.<br><br>Individuals and scientists around the world immediately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/epidemiologist-britain-herd-immunity-coronavirus-covid-19\">pointed out the obvious flaws</a>: there\u2019s no way to ensure only young people get infected; you need 60-70% of the population to be infected and recover to have a shot at herd immunity, and there aren\u2019t that many young and healthy people in the UK, or anywhere. Moreover, many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/23/scientists-effects-coronavirus-children-studies-carriers\">young people have severe cases</a> of the disease, overloading healthcare systems, and a not-so-small number of them die. It is not a free ride.<br><br>This doesn\u2019t even include the possibility, already suspected in some cases, of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/japanese-woman-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-for-second-time\">re</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/japanese-woman-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-for-second-time\">ccurrence of the disease</a>. Immunity may not even be reliable for this virus.</p> <p>Worse, it did not take into account that the duration of hospitalisation can be lengthier than they think, or that one can incur a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/london-hospitals-struggle-to-cope-with-coronavirus-surge\">shortage of hospital beds</a>.</p> <p>Second, but more grave, is the policymaking. No 10 appears to be enamoured with \u201cscientism\u201d \u2013 things that have the cosmetic attributes of science but without its rigour. This manifests itself in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/why-is-the-government-relying-on-nudge-theory-to-tackle-coronavirus\">nudge group</a> that engages in experimenting with UK citizens or applying methods from behavioural economics that fail to work outside the university \u2013 yet patronise citizens as an insult to their ancestral wisdom and risk-perception apparatus. Social science is in a \u201creplication crisis\u201d, where less than half the results replicate (under exact same conditions), less than a tenth can be taken seriously, and less than a hundredth translate into the real world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/24/uk-coronavirus-live-news-lockdown-boris-johnson-sports-direct-abandons-talk-of-opening-stores-as-gove-clarifies-scope-of-lockdown-rules\">UK coronavirus live: 12,000 former NHS workers to return and emergency hospital to open\u00a0as death toll rises</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So what is called \u201cevidence-based\u201d methods have a dire track record and are pretty much evidence-free.

  "<p><em>The Schengen Agreement, signed on 14 June 1985, saw five countries agreeing to begin reducing internal border controls with the ultimate goal of allowing free movement with the Schengen area.

The signing ceremony in the hamlet of Schengen, involving ministers from Belgium, France, Holland, Luxembourg and Germany, is a step towards a 12-nation single European market without frontiers.</p> <p>But the agreement is regarded with suspicion by the British government.</p> <p>The agreement will allow development of a common police information system, and an understanding that police from the five states may pursue suspects across borders for up to 10 kilometres and, with the exception of France, make arrests. Britain continues to insist that only national border controls can assure action against criminals and terrorists.</p> <h2>Passport controls abolished in seven states as \u2018Schengenland\u2019 takes latest step towards integration</h2> <p>by Alex Bellos and John Carvel<br>27 March 1995</p> <p>British travellers to Schengenland are unlikely to notice much difference to their journeys. Holidaymakers driving on motorways between the seven countries which have signed the Schengen convention will not need to show their passports, but the implementation of the free-travel area brought little change at most land border crossing points, where immigration control had become sporadic over recent years.</p> <p>The latest step in European integration appeared to be going ahead smoothly at airports in the seven European Union member states where passport controls were abolished on flights between France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Spain and Portugal.</p> <p>The change, however, does not mean anyone can travel without a passport on the Continent. In each of the Schengen countries police can ask people to prove their identity with an identity card, which Britons do not have, or a passport.</p> <p>Only Britain is opposed in principle to abandoning border controls. Italy and Greece are members of Schengen and will abolish internal border controls when their external borders are secure. Austria is due to become a member next month. Denmark, Sweden and Finland want to join if they can preserve open borders with Norway and Iceland. Ireland has no objection in principle, but does not want to disturb the common travel area with Britain.</p> <p>Some observers fear an increase in random identity checks with the consequence that such checks are more annoying than having to show a passport at the border.</p> <p>New procedures are also likely on the external Schengenland border, where security is being strengthened, and this may affect the British traveller. At the Calais ferry terminal, for example, there may eventually be more passport checks \u2013 now cursory or non-existent \u2013 causing delays.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/05/is-the-schengen-dream-of-europe-without-borders-becoming-a-thing-of-the-past\">Is the Schengen dream of Europe without borders becoming a thing of the past?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the sleepy village of Schengen on the south-western tip of Luxembourg, where the plan was agreed in 1985, an abandoned customs house at the end of the bridge leading to Germany and France is no more than a cobwebbed relic of former national divisions.</p> <p>MEPs celebrating abolition of controls in Schengen yesterday were outnumbered by German and French motorists nipping over the border as usual to top up with cheap Luxembourg petrol and lower-duty alcohol and cigarettes.</p> <p>Queues may also form at ports and airports due to border guards accessing the elaborate Schengen computer network, built in a bombproof bunker in Strasbourg, which has already been loaded with 2 million data files on people, stolen cars and fake identity cards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a7519be7657fce25b2db498c470681245f2b8cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a7519be7657fce25b2db498c470681245f2b8cd/0_106_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An old custom post on the border between Belgium and France in Alveringem, Belgium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An old custom post on the border between Belgium and France in Alveringem, Belgium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fran\u00e7ois Lenoir/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The brave new world of a Europe without frontiers</h2> <p>by Ian Traynor<br>from Suben on the German and Austrian frontier<br>27 March 1995</p> <p>It is nigh impossible to find Schengen on a map of Europe, even harder than finding Maastricht. But for the border guards, politicians and officials who yesterday began policing the brave new world of a Europe Without Frontiers, Schengen is more than a village in Luxembourg.</p> <p>It\u2019s a country. \u201cIn Schengen you can travel from here uncontrolled right down to Portugal,\u201d said Josef Heisl, head of the German border police on this stretch of the frontier with Austria. It\u2019s a portent. \u201cA milestone on the way to a united Europe,\u201d said Manfred Kanther, Germany\u2019s interior minister.</p> <p>But for Tomasz, a Hungarian student driving to Cologne, it is a nuisance. \u201cThe Germans are always the same if you\u2019ve got a smart car. They\u2019re convinced it\u2019s stolen. Now they\u2019ve got this new system for tracing,\u201d he said as the Bavarian guard ordered his Opel Calibra aside while its details were fed into the Euro-computer.</p> <p>An hour earlier, a traveller\u2019s details were fed into the network. Back came the unwonted response that the French authorities had queries about the subject\u2019s residence permit.</p> <p>\u201cThere was no arrest warrant out for him,\u201d Mr Heisl explained. \u201cWe let him go. But we made a note of his details, address, and forwarded them to the French.\u201d</p> <p>Further north on the German-Polish border, a Pole trying to enter Germany was handcuffed and led away when the computer spat out the revelation that she was on France\u2019s wanted list.</p> <p>For the citizens of the seven countries participating in Schengen, most of western continental Europe is now entirely hassle-free when it comes to travelling. The corollary, of course, is that the external borders of \u201cSchengen\u201d get ever tighter.</p> <p>This was clear in Suben on the Danube yesterday. There was no doubt with whom Mr Heisl\u2019s guards were concerned. Austria is not yet part of Schengen, but Austrians milled back and forth unchecked. Every east European car had to pull aside.</p> <p>For its part, the Polish government reacted sniffily to the overtures of the Schengen beneficiaries. Bonn asked Warsaw to introduce a a fast lane for EU nationals. The Poles said no.</p> <p>Britain is less troubled by that prospect, having set its face against joining Schengen, fearing undesirables.</p> <p>Europe Without Frontiers should have started up two years ago under the Single European Act that provided for free movement of \u201cgoods, services, persons and capital\u201d. In negotiating the deal, Margaret Thatcher backed freedom for goods, services and capital, but objected to that for human beings.</p> <p>Glitches in the computer system, legal problems, and worries about criminals, illegal immigrants, drugs, plutonium and stolen cars have also held up Schengen. But new police powers are being framed to combat the risks, alarming civil libertarians.</p> <p>Under various bilateral agreements, national police forces can cross the border and, in certain cases, make arrests in another country.</p> <p>Mr Heisl is all for this: \u201cWe should bring in these powers everywhere. Now is the right time to do it. Politically, we might not get another chance. The criminals now have free rein in Schengen.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 8 April 2020.

  "<p>In times of crisis, we turn to the wisdom and comfort to be found in the classics. I refer, of course, to Clueless, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/27/clueless-nostalgia-friends-pokemon-bowie\">the 1995 film starring Alicia Silverstone as Cher Horowitz</a>. \u201cCher\u2019s main thrill in life is a makeover,\u201d her best friend observes. \u201cIt gives her a sense of control in a world full of chaos.\u201d</p> <p>We could all do with that right now. In the space of days, the fabric of our daily lives has changed out of all recognition. We are in our homes, yet in completely unfamiliar territory. It helps a little bit, I think, to take control of that home environment in a positive way. A wardrobe sort-out is a pitch-perfect distraction, at some point over the next three weeks. It is just absorbing enough to keep your mind from spinning out on the centrifugal forces of existential angst, without being taxing on your already overloaded brain. You can purge what you don\u2019t wear, and realign the clothes you like into outfits you want to wear, when wearing outfits is a thing again. You have been meaning to do this for years, probably, but it\u2019s the sort of thing that has never quite made it to the top of the to-do list \u2013 until now. Putting together jazzy outfits at a point when your social life is non-existent is a cheering reminder that, although this is seismic, it is temporary; the world will start turning again and it is nice to remind ourselves that there will be an afterwards.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Focus on the clothes you love wearing and build a wardrobe around them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The revamp plan below is a six-stage process of bite-size chunks. Despite the time freed up by all the plans that have evaporated from my diary, I am finding that \u2013 what with working from home, functioning as the cheerleader for two remote-learning timetables, endlessly hand-washing and surface-wiping and juggling Houseparty dates and WhatsApp loo roll memes \u2013 I don\u2019t actually have uninterrupted swathes of downtime. What I do have are random, unscheduled nuggets of time \u2013 15 minutes here, half an hour there. Easy enough to fritter away on Twitter \u2013 or, alternatively, a road to a new, streamlined wardrobe.</p> <h2>Step one: get started</h2> <p>Some people will tell you to start a wardrobe revamp by getting everything out of your wardrobe and dividing it into piles on the floor. Those people are mad. Those people do not have teenage children who will urgently announce the need for a new printer cartridge that must be purchased and installed before a live maths lesson that starts in 20 minutes and also when is lunch and can they have a snack? We are all a little overwhelmed right now and I don\u2019t think turning our bedrooms into a giant fabric tangle is what anyone needs.</p> <p>Instead, start small. Empty out your sock drawer, throw away odd socks and ripped tights and look at what you have. If you have enough socks in good condition, you don\u2019t need to hoard tatty ones \u201cjust in case\u201d. Just do one drawer, then make yourself a cup of tea. You can do this with your underwear next, then your pyjamas and sports gear and so on, bit by bit.<br></p> <h2>Step two: your at-home wardrobe</h2> <p>You need different clothes right now, so let\u2019s start with that. The licence to be cosy and comfortable is one of the few positives of this moment, so take full advantage, but it is worth keeping it civilised. If you are working from home, then, yes, you can get away with conducting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/mar/19/work-at-home-coronavirus-office-self-isolating\">Zoom or Google Hangouts meetings</a> in a crisply ironed silk blouse while wearing jam-smeared joggers on your bottom half, but that doesn\u2019t mean it is a great idea. </p> <p>You don\u2019t have to sit at your kitchen table in a tailored skirt suit, though. A pair of smart tracksuit bottoms and a crew-neck sweater is ideal for maximum comfort while still looking presentable. Pull out all your comfortable-but-not-scruffy trousers, then find a top half to match each: a silk T-shirt with a cardigan, perhaps, or a buttoned-up polo shirt. If working from home is new for you, consider hanging up an outfit for each working day, even if you don\u2019t normally plan outfits in advance.</p> <h2>Step three: the foundations</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28af2fbdb226dc4673a6ae9646ea350f74353c78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28af2fbdb226dc4673a6ae9646ea350f74353c78/1369_525_2659_2657/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Filter the trousers and jeans that fit and suit you from those that can go to the charity shop.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Filter the trousers and jeans that fit and suit you from those that can go to the charity shop.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Newby/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Get half-dressed in a white or black T-shirt and knickers. Make a pile of every pair of jeans or trousers you own, then try on each one in front of a full-length mirror. Compare and contrast is the only way to work out which jeans and trousers actually fit and suit you. Be ruthless. Which clothes are you excited to wear when you start going out again? The rest can go. Now may not be the time to be making unnecessary trips to charity shops \u2013 although most are still accepting donations, with precautions including leaving them for 72 hours after drop-off \u2013 but you can bag them up and stash them out of the way.</p> <h2>Step four: the treasures</h2> <p>The quickest route to a style revamp is to focus on the clothes you love wearing and build a wardrobe around them. This is much smarter than weeding around the edges of your wardrobe, which takes ages and doesn\u2019t really change all that much \u2013 all you are doing then is physically getting rid of the low-hanging fruit that your brain relegated months ago.</p> <p>Pull out the 10 pieces in your wardrobe that you wear time and time again and would be devastated to lose. Whether they are Hermes or H&amp;M does not matter \u2013 those are your treasures. Imagine those as the centre of gravity of your wardrobe, then pull out pieces that work with them \u2013 if you have a silk blouse in your treasures, find the bottoms that work best with them and hang them together. If it is a summer dress, see if you have a blazer or a chunky cardigan that could make the dress work as a cool-weather outfit also. Hang this treasure chest together. Are there themes you can spot \u2013 colours that you like wearing best, a skirt length that works best? If so, log those for future shopping reference.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0dcc21dcbbf7ace1a31f443db8691fa4fb81dcfa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0dcc21dcbbf7ace1a31f443db8691fa4fb81dcfa/137_130_1413_848/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pile of jumpers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Which jumpers are your treasures?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><br>Step five: the outliers</h2> <p>Whoever came up with that thing of having a \u201csummer\u201d wardrobe and a \u201cwinter\u201d one and flipping the two around had clearly never spent any time in the British climate. It just does not work. A workplace in January can require fewer layers than a beach in July. But what is helpful is siphoning off the extremes so that they don\u2019t clutter your wardrobe and your vision. Heavy winter coats can go in a suitcase, along with snow boots and thick gloves. Likewise, your holiday wardrobe \u2013 most swimwear, beach cover-ups, stuff that aesthetically only works out of office \u2013 can be packed in, say, a straw basket and stashed somewhere.</p> <h2>Step six: the rest</h2> <p>You are nearly there! That was easy, right? Next time you have got a chunk of time free, go through all of your dresses \u2013 pull out your five favourites, then your next five, as if you were picking a sports team. Add in a couple of unexciting but solid dependables. You can probably get rid of the rest. Then do the same with your knitwear. Rinse and repeat until you have streamlined your wardrobe. You can do this bit by bit \u2013 if it takes a few weeks, that is fine. While the world is on pause, we have the time to do the things we never have time to do. You won\u2019t be in those tracksuit bottoms for ever. There will be an afterwards. And if that is not worth dressing up for, I don\u2019t know what is.</p>",
  "<p>The first big need is medical supplies, facilities and personnel.

The Federal Reserve should be empowered to buy unlimited debt from state and local governments and both debt and equity from private companies.

What you need to know about the US coronavirus bailout</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Maintaining vital civilian supplies, especially food, medicines and fuel, is the second big need. This is a two-part problem. The first part is to make sure that there are goods in the stores and pharmacies, and that gas stations and drive-through restaurants can remain open. The second part is to ensure that those at home have the means to pay, and that local distribution remains orderly.</p> <p>To keep supplies flowing, there must be higher pay and credible protections for essential workers, such as drivers, stockers, checkout clerks and security guards. Amazon and Walmart are already raising pay. Groceries, pharmacies and service stations must most urgently protect their workers, who are exposed to hundreds of customers every hour, from getting sick. After healthcare, protection should go there. Distribution networks will break if stores can\u2019t stay open or if shoppers won\u2019t go in.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/a-business-fiscal-response-to-covid-19-recession/\">Payroll replacement through the business</a> is the best solution for those on <em>existing</em> payrolls, as Glenn Hubbard has written. The employer can get an interest-free loan from the bank, cover payroll and claim a reimbursement from the federal government on quarterly taxes. Small business owners can pay themselves, up to a cap. This approach is seamless, sensible, precisely targeted. Coverage can be discounted. The UK is doing 80% of payroll; Denmark is doing 75%. US workers probably have more out-of-pocket work-related costs, such as commuting, so 70% might be right. There should be a supplement for tipped workers; employers know who they are. Audits later can deter fraud.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The solution is not to ration by price! If prices go up too much, people will panic. Markets will not adjust; they will collapse</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For self-employed and gig workers, the fast, efficient way is to <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-republican-stimulus-bill-is-full-of-holes\">qualify them for unemployment insurance</a> as long as necessary. If wage workers remain on payrolls, it will be much easier for the UI system to ramp up and meet the new claims. Similar terms and discounts should apply.</p> <p>Orderly distribution must be maintained. There seem few problems yet with the raw supplies of most basics. But if goods can get to the shelves, will they soon disappear into the hands of hoarders and black marketeers? The solution is <em>not </em>to ration by price! If prices go up too much, people will panic. Markets will not adjust; they will collapse. Prices must be held to costs. For the most part, large distributors will do this; they have reputations to protect.</p> <p>A shortage economy may arrive anyway, with long lines to get into stores, empty shelves inside and black markets all around. This would be a health disaster. Lines are already a byproduct of mandatory social distancing rules. Some shortages have been reported \u2013 sanitizer and toilet paper, notably.</p> <p>The solution is <em>to limit sales per customer</em>, and <em>if necessary to control prices and ration basics</em> like rice, potatoes, flour, pasta, eggs, milk, cooking oil and staple meats. Rationing and price controls can be run by local authorities under a general <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stabilization_Act_of_1942\">hold-the-line order</a>, as was done in the second world war from April 1943 onward. Put up signs with the allowed prices. Civilians will enforce them.</p> <p>All evictions, foreclosures and utility stoppages must be stopped. People need to remain safe and secure in their homes whether they can pay the bills or not. For those still being paid or getting relief, a deferral on rent and mortgages, discounted by the degree of lost income, may suffice. For those left out, probably the best thing is to hold everyone harmless for now and plan to sort it out later.</p> <p>Basic communications \u2013 internet, cable, phone \u2013 should be made free for the duration. To make films and concerts free would also greatly help people to cope. The government can reimburse communications companies for the cost.</p> <p>All other utilities need to run as public services, the crucial goal being to maintain access, calm and order, at stable prices. With stores and factories shut, it is unlikely that power supplies will run short. Again, decisions on how to deal with unpayable arrears can come later.</p> <ul> <li><p>James K Galbraith is a senior scholar with the Levy Economics Institute, and chair of the board of Economists for Peace and Security, an international association of professional economists</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>For the last week, Ahmed, a driver for Uber and Lyft, has faced a heartbreaking choice: starvation or sickness.</p> <p>Ahmed has four kids, ages 11, eight, five and three.

Or he can stay home, protecting his health and complying with health officials\u2019 warnings, but losing his family\u2019s income.</p> <p>The choice he faces is cruel and unfair. It\u2019s also supposed to be illegal.</p> <p>For the last seven years, gig companies like Uber, Lyft, Instacart, Doordash and Postmates have leveraged the language of \u201ctechnology\u201d and \u201cinnovation\u201d to hide how their business models shift risks on to a vulnerable and largely immigrant workforce. At the core of these exploitative businesses, behind the Silicon Valley talk of technical wizardry, is the fiction that their workers are \u201cindependent contractors\u201d and not employees.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/19/uber-lyft-coronavirus-benefits-ab5\">Uber and Lyft drivers protest to demand more benefits during coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is critically important for these companies. When workers are classified as independent contractors, employers don\u2019t have to provide them with basic protections and benefits, including the minimum wage and unemployment insurance. Misclassifying workers this way is a practice that Lyft, Uber and other gig companies have relied upon for a long time to keep their hopes for future profitability alive.</p> <p>Just a few months ago,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/19/lets-follow-californias-lead-and-regulate-companies-like-uber\"> though, the California </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/19/lets-follow-californias-lead-and-regulate-companies-like-uber\">legislature passed AB5</a>, a law that says companies cannot classify workers as \u201cindependent contractors\u201d without very good justifications. At the center of the law is a straightforward test: the status of \u201cindependent contractor\u201d can <em>only </em>be applied to workers engaged in work that is distinct from the company\u2019s core business.</p> <p>Since Uber and Lyft provide transportation services as their core business, the law reasons that the drivers who deliver this service must be treated as employees. But Uber, Lyft and other gig companies are defying the law, endangering drivers and the public in the process.</p> <p>For illegally misclassified and unprotected gig workers like Ahmed, the Covid-19 pandemic is a crisis on top of a crisis. Covid-19 has made the meaning of precarity clear for millions of people, who are now living on the edge. But before Covid-19, gig workers already knew this reality.</p> <p>Ahmed and millions of other gig workers have been living on the brink of poverty at the whim of large data-driven companies that have the power to arbitrarily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/22/uber-lyft-ipo-drivers-unionize-low-pay-expenses\">lower wages</a>,<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/08/transgender-uber-driver-suspended-tech-oversight-facial-recognition.html\"> kick workers off</a> their platforms, and tune their algorithms in ways that optimize for revenue growth at the expense of worker wellbeing.</p> <p>The pandemic is a force multiplier that spells destitution for these already vulnerable workers. During normal times, Ahmed struggles to meet his family\u2019s needs, despite working 12 hours or more five or more days a week. In the recent past, when he faced a dire emergency after his car broke down, he was able to borrow money from family and friends. But the pandemic is causing massive uncertainty, and Ahmed says no one has money to lend him right now.</p> <p>Uber and Lyft refuse to treat drivers such as Ahmed as employees, let alone as people worthy of care and protection. Until Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez introduced AB5, gig workers\u2019 demands for just working conditions fell on deaf ears.</p> <p>After it passed, the companies resisted. Instead of complying, they pooled $110m to get a proposition on the ballot, hoping to get out from under the law. In place of AB5, their ballot initiative <a href=\"http://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/the-uber-lyft-ballot-initiative-guarantees-only-5-64-an-hour/\">offers driver \u201cbenefits\u201d</a> including what amounts to a woefully inadequate $5.64/hr wage guarantee and a limited healthcare stipend, available to only a small handful of workers.</p> <p>Now, Uber\u2019s CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, is using the pandemic as an opportunity to <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8847qb/uber-asks-us-government-to-give-its-workers-health-insurance\">urge the Trump administration</a> to create a new category of worker \u2013 neither employee nor independent contractor \u2013 which would not give workers basic safety net protections, but would inscribe the company\u2019s exploitative business model into federal law.</p> <p>Ahmed is one of hundreds of thousands of drivers in California demanding relief. <a href=\"https://drivers-united.org/a/demand-coronavirus-relief-for-platform-workers\">Rideshare Drivers United</a>, a group of worker organizers who helped make AB5 a reality, is pushing for a statewide eviction moratorium and a temporary basic income for gig workers. They are also asking that Uber, Lyft and other gig companies redirect the $110m they set aside to fund their way out of basic employment laws, and instead put it into an emergency fund for workers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Gig companies have used workers to create wealth and profit, but they have refused to treat them as people who need basic protections</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the meantime, Ahmed has been forced to choose work over health. But with the pandemic causing low ridership, and in the absence of any guaranteed hourly wage, he\u2019s still falling short of what his family needs to survive. He cannot make his car payment or his insurance payment or purchase gas. He is frantic about next month\u2019s rent, what will happen when his family\u2019s food runs out, and how he might cope without health insurance if he, his parents or his wife contracts the virus.</p> <p>Since their inception, gig companies have used workers to create wealth and profit, but they have refused to treat them as people who need basic protections and wages to live and thrive. One week into the pandemic, Uber and Lyft\u2019s positions have not changed. But they must: for the wellbeing of workers, and for our collective health. The state must ensure compliance and protect this vulnerable workforce.

  "<p>A child bride who spent 19 years in prison for a murder she did not commit is to sue the Pakistan authorities in an effort to persuade the country to help thousands of other victims of miscarriages of justice.</p> <p>Rani Bibi was just 14 when she was convicted, alongside her father, brother and cousin, of the murder of her husband and spent the next two decades sweeping the floors of an overcrowded Pakistan prison.</p> <p>Last year a Lahore high court judge acquitted her of all charges, apologetically noting that she \u201cwas left to languish in the jail solely due to [the] lacklustre attitude of the jail authorities\u201d. He added that \u201cthis court feels helpless in compensating her\u201d.</p> <p> Bibi is trying to regain her life as best she can. Sitting on a chair in her dilapidated two-room shack on the outskirts of Islamabad, with no financial means, she despairs of her second chance in life. Now 36, she had not reached the legal age of marriage under Pakistani law when she was forcibly married off by her parents. Soon after her husband was murdered, with his body buried alongside the shovel used to kill him. She was jailed along with her father, who died in prison, her brother and cousin, who were both released long before she was. There was no evidence at all to link Bibi to the crime.</p> <p>\u201cI am [a] victim of the injustice; the entire system is responsible [for] ruining my teenage and youth years in prison without any crime,\u201d she told the Guardian<em>.</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/pakistan-passes-law-against-child-abuse-in-wake-of-zainab-ansari-case\">Pakistan passes law against child abuse in wake of Zainab Ansari case</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Bibi struggles to find work because of her notoriety. She has remarried and lives with her husband and brother. \u201cI was formerly working as domestic help but have not a stable job since then. Although acquitted, I struggle to find employment due to the stigma attached to time spent in prison\u201d.</p> <p> She was let down on several occasions by the authorities, after being convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in 2001. The prison superintendent did not follow the legal process, and failed to file her appeal to the high court.</p> <p>She only found out in 2014 when, by chance, her case was discovered by a lawyer, the late advocate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/13/asma-jahangir-obituary\">Asma </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/13/asma-jahangir-obituary\"> Jahangir</a> , who came across Bibi in prison and pursued an appeal. She was finally acquitted in 2017. However, Pakistan has no system to compensate victims of miscarriages of justice, something Bibi and her supporters now hope to change.</p> <p>This month saw a petition filed at Lahore\u2019s high court against the Punjab government, urging judges to compensate Bibi and seeking new legislation to act against wrongful convictions.</p> <p>\u201cThis case needs acknowledgement from the judges of the miscarriage of justice,\u201d said Michelle Shahid, a lawyer from the Foundation for Fundamental Rights, a group working for Bibi, who estimates that there are thousands of similar cases in Pakistan. \u201cThere is no debate in Pakistan about wrongful convictions of criminal cases and this is the right time to introduce legislation about this issue,\u201d she said.</p> <p>A 2019 study by the foundation found that of the death sentences reviewed by the Pakistan supreme court, 78% of those decided by lower courts were overturned.</p> <p>A senior official at Lahore high court told <em> </em>the Guardian, on condition of anonymity, that \u201cwrongful convictions are due to false testimony and judges have no fault on this issue\u201d.</p> <p>Legal experts believe Bibi\u2019s case is a precedent and can help fix a flawed legal system that wrongfully convicts thousands of people and leaves the innocent without support to rebuild lives after they are eventually acquitted.</p> <p>\u201cThe case of Rani Bibi spending two decades in jail after being wrongly convicted, may seem rather alarming to outside observers, but those who practise law recognise that convictions on the basis of circumstantial evidence or confessions extracted through torture by the investigating agencies are a fairly common occurrence,\u201d a senior Islamabad attorney, Osama Malik, told <em> </em>the Guardian.</p> <p>He said the judicial system lacks the capacity to cope with the country\u2019s growing population and huge caseloads lead to backlogs. Lower courts rely too heavily on flimsy evidence and dubious confessions, sometimes obtained through torture.</p> <p>\u201cPakistan in 2008 became a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which guarantees that anyone who suffers from a miscarriage of justice will be compensated. However, this is something that Pakistani courts have been reluctant to enforce for fear that the sheer number of wrongful convictions every year may result in opening of the floodgates with thousands of victims demanding compensation,\u201d Malik said.</p> <p>For Bibi, her wish is to ensure \u201cthat no citizen of Pakistan suffers at the hands of the criminal justice system like I have\u201d.</p>",

They worry about long hours separated from their loved ones during a time of unprecedented generational stress. They worry about the basics of running a home: childcare and lesson planning, food and, yes, even toilet paper.</p> <h2><strong>Dr Michael Szava-Kovats, </strong><strong>emergency </strong><strong>medicine </strong><strong>physician</strong></h2> <p><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong></p> <p>Five weeks ago, Dr Erin Bruce, an anesthesiologist, and her husband, Dr Michael Szava-Kovats, had their first child, a daughter. He agonizes over the thought of exposing his young daughter and wife to infection. He accepts that he may get coronavirus. The risks to his family are outside his comfort zone, he says.</p> <p>Last weekend, he moved into an empty condo owned by friends.</p> <p>\u201cThe biggest justification of it is because we\u2019re in uncertain times and whatever is going to declare itself is going way too rapidly for us to be able to be reactive to it,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He worked five days in a row after his move. On his first day off, the sadness of their separation hit him. He feels a combination of guilt that he\u2019s not there to help with a newborn and heartache that he missing out on the first months of his daughter\u2019s life. He longs to be with his wife during an event that\u2019s changing their lives and history.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard because I want to be with my family. I am not doing this because I want to.\u201d</p> <p>The couple is considering meeting for walks but they aren\u2019t comfortable with it yet.</p> <p>Szava-Kovats has set out strict rituals to stay focused and calm over the next weeks. He calls Bruce at the same time every day and meditates before each shift at the hospital. He goes through a painstaking hygiene protocol at every stage of a workday: getting dressed, leaving the apartment, entering the ER and then decontaminating himself when he leaves.</p> <p>He described morale as high among his colleagues, and they have united together for the good of their community. But there will be long-term psychological consequences for everyone, he said.</p> <p>\u201cI think the prescription that we have for the community of staying home is the medicine that\u2019s going to make us as safe as possible, but it has side-effects that we have to be aware of and take care of those.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Dr Bonnie Larson, family medicine physician, and Dr</strong><strong> Alan Chu, anesthesiologist</strong></h2> <p><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong></p> <p>Drs Bonnie Larson and Alan Chu met at medical school and bonded over their shared interest in global health. They\u2019re married with two children.</p> <p>Larson is a frontline physician working with the city\u2019s homeless. She\u2019s working to keep Covid-19 out of local shelters. Chu is leading online training for residents about coronavirus and airway management, but is readying for a crush of sick patients to arrive in the ICU.</p> <p>They wonder what it will be like for their kids, ages eight and 10, to go through the pandemic without at least one parent home all the time.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s anxiety-provoking, for sure, for us,\u201d said Chu. \u201cThe [kids] would rather have their parents around them but they also know this is what we do.\u201d</p> <p>The pair is relying on neighbours, other physicians and medical students to help with childcare. Their regular nanny, who has worked with them since their second child was born, also cares for elderly members of her family, and they are uncomfortable with having her at their home for long hours during a pandemic.</p> <p>Larson cried as she described hearing other parents talk about homeschooling schedules and meal plans for their kids. She wishes she could make a lesson plan for her kids and be with them over the next few months, \u201cbut that\u2019s not happening. Our kids are going to have a bit of a different experience.\u201d</p> <p>Over the last week, Larson and Chu were busier than usual, readying their departments for the unthinkable. Friends gifted them rolls of toilet paper because they knew the couple didn\u2019t have time to stock up.</p> <p>Larson and Chu plan to continue to be there for patients and colleagues as long as they are needed.</p> <p>\u201cIn medicine, at this point in our careers, what we can potentially offer, it doesn\u2019t make any sense not to show up just because it\u2019s scary or hard,\u201d says Larson.</p> <h2><strong>Dr Zara Mathews, </strong><strong>emergency </strong><strong>room </strong><strong>physician</strong></h2> <p><strong>San Mateo, California</strong></p> <p>Dr Zara Mathews is 34 weeks pregnant and mother of a toddler.

Everyone has concerns about risks that they bring to our family but the primary focus is doing everything they can for our patients.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant. My colleagues are balancing risks in their own lives.

When he gets a cold, it lasts for ages.</p> <p>\u201cI wonder if he\u2019s more susceptible and maybe I wouldn\u2019t have any symptoms,\u201d says Toevs, also has a master\u2019s in bioethics.</p> <p>\u201cDo I run the risk of bringing it home? Sure. But I also believe God is sovereign in the universe. There is a plan, he is in complete control.\u201d</p> <p>As a trauma surgeon and ICU director at a hospital for city with a metropolitan population of 170,000, Toevs\u2019s priority is on looking after patients and keeping the hospital going, she says.</p> <p>She is concerned about what will happen if high numbers of staff get sick, or she gets sick. Even if one trauma surgeon becomes unable to work in a community of this size, it affects the hospital\u2019s ability to provide care.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re in a limited resource environment and some of your people get sick, it makes a difference.\u201d</p> <p>There is not yet a single known case of Covid-19 in Terre Haute. The hospital has restricted its entrances and exits, and patients are verbally screened before they come in. The first person could be anyone, so everyone is a risk.</p> <p>Everybody has a responsibility in this pandemic, she says. Non-essential workers have a social obligation to stay home to minimize the risk for everyone. Her responsibility is to care for patients. \u201cI get up every day and make a commitment to take care of people. To sit at home and live in fear is a terrible way to live life.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>\u201cThe first time I went, I wanted to cry,\u201d said Luc\u00eda, a mother of three, describing how her economic situation would compel her to do the journey from her home in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez to line up outside a blood plasma donation center in El Paso, Texas.</p> \n<p>There are more than 800 such facilities in the US and they have been expanding around the southern border in recent years, harvesting plasma of a growing number of Mexicans traveling across the border on temporary visas, in need of cash.</p> \n<p>In a regular week, before the coronavirus outbreak, <a href=\"https://www.daserste.de/information/reportage-dokumentation/dokus/videos/bloodtrade-english-version-video-100.html\">thousands of donors crossed the border</a> into the US to make money this way, which appears to be in a legal gray area.</p> \n<p>Some donors have given plasma twice a week for years, and scientific research has shown that high donation frequency can have harmful long-term consequences, including to the immune system.</p> \n<p>The UK imports all of its plasma used for the production of medicine from the US. This is a legacy of 1990s fears in the UK over \u201cmad cow\u201d disease, known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob, though the UK has only recently stepped up importing plasma from the border area.</p> \n<blockquote> \n</blockquote> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"de866165-2c86-4fa5-9313-052e9f8eb7ea\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Plasma is the fluid that holds white and red blood cells in suspension and is of vital importance to its recipients for various medical needs.

He says he makes twice as much doing this as in his work as a welder.</p> \n<p>\u201cSometimes some of these donors come in with their stories, \u2018That\u2019s how I\u2019m going to get my children\u2019s diapers,\u2019 or, \u2018That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to eat today \u2013 if I can\u2019t donate, we\u2019re not eating,\u2019\u201d said a former BPL employee, who asked not to be named.</p> \n<p>Even before the corona crisis hit, Lucia decided she no longer wanted to donate, but prior to new Covid-19 restrictions, plenty of other Mexicans have been meticulously following the permitted donation schedule of coming twice a week.</p> \n<p>To accommodate such high numbers of donors, according to a report written by British inspectors in February, BPL runs a shuttle bus to bring donors from the border with Mexico to the plasma center in the town of Laredo, Texas.</p> \n<p>Donations collected in the US by BPL Plasma are supplied to BPL Therapeutics, in Elstree, Hertfordshire, where it transforms 1.2m liters of blood plasma per year into life-saving drugs for the UK and dozens of other countries commercially.</p> \n<p>BPL\u2019s origins in the UK date from the 1950s and it was long owned by the state-run National Health Service (NHS) until 2013, when a majority of the company was controversially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/25/uk-blood-plasma-company-sale-nhs-supplies?CMP=share_btn_tw\">sold to Bain Capital</a>, a private equity firm in the US, for \u00a3200m.

One assistant manager of the BPL Plasma collection center in El Paso that is closest to the border said: \u201c90% of people come from Ju\u00e1rez. It\u2019s more compensation than they make in a week at their jobs.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Long-term effects</strong></h2> \n<p>US regulations permit twice-weekly donations \u2013 or a total of 104 times a year, while in the UK the limits are twice monthly, or <a href=\"https://www.transfusionguidelines.org/red-book/chapter-3-care-and-selection-of-whole-blood-and-component-donors-including-donors-of-pre-deposit-autologous-blood/3-6-frequency-of-donation\">24 times a year</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11778078\">Peter Hellstern</a>, director of the Center of Hemostasis and Thrombosis in Z\u00fcrich, conducted one of the few existing studies on long-term effects of high-frequency plasma donations. His conclusion: it can be <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16907878\">safe to donate often</a>, if the antibody level of someone\u2019s blood is monitored closely \u2013 at a minimum, before every fifth donation. In the US, this test is routinely conducted every four months, with no minimum threshold. \u201cThe donor doesn\u2019t notice a drop of antibodies, but is far more at risk for infections. It\u2019s a trappy situation,\u201d Hellstern said.</p> \n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3001115/\">Paul Strengers</a> from the International Plasma Fractionation Association (IPFA), the loss of antibodies may have a highly deleterious effect on the immune system, and in the worst case could lead to potentially deadly infections like pneumonia. \u201cThis may include also any influenza virus but also the coronavirus,\u201d Strengers said, adding that there was no evidence so far of actual infections among high-frequency donors.</p> \n<p>In the plasma donation centers, donors the NDR/the Guardian talked to last month said they were not advised in advance of possible long-term health consequences.</p> \n<p>BPL Plasma did not respond to all of the questions asked by the Guardian and NDR but said in a statement: \u201cBPL collection centers operate in strict accordance with the FDA &amp; industry guidelines that exist to promote the safety of both plasma donors and the patients who use plasma derived therapeutics.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked about impact of Covid-19, BPL Plasma said this week that health and safety of staff and donors was their mission, adding: \u201cWe are closely monitoring guidelines issued by both federal and local authorities and are implementing enhanced safety protocols in our collection centers.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the UK, the maximum plasma donation allowance is 15 liters per person per year. US regulations permit up to 92 liters per person per year, with <a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=640.65\">two donations in a </a><a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=640.65\">seven-day period</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"87c5d6f93e4ccbe18f6758d20c814c9a12fdb932\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87c5d6f93e4ccbe18f6758d20c814c9a12fdb932/0_0_7243_5026/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colorful window ads at BLP Plasma in downtown El Paso.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"694\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colorful window ads at BLP Plasma in downtown El Paso.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gabriela Campos/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The UK\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) sends inspectors to plasma centers in the US that export to the UK. Asked about the discrepancy in donation frequencies permitted in the US versus the UK, the agency said it was a question for \u201crelevant US authorities\u201d.</p> \n<p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said its \u201cregulations have been established to ensure that a donor is in good health prior to donation\u201d, and added: \u201cWe recognize that regulators in other countries may reach different regulatory conclusions even when considering the same data.\u201d</p> \n<p>When asked about the high donation frequency, the PPTA, a private trade organization that represents the for-profit plasma-producing pharmaceutical companies in North America and Europe, said the plasma centers were meeting all FDA standards.</p> \n<h2><strong>Coronavirus</strong></h2> \n<p>A reduction in plasma donors because of the Covid-19 crisis could affect the supply chain of plasma shipments to the UK, and Europe, which imports around 40% of its blood plasma from the US. \u201cWe do expect the rapid spread of Covid-19 could adversely impact the supply of plasma,\u201d a BPL Plasma spokesperson said.</p> \n<p>Most European countries don\u2019t pay donors but rely on paid plasma donations imported from the US. As reporting by <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/pharmaceutical-companies-are-luring-mexicans-across-the-u.s.-border-to-donate-blood-plasma\">ARD German TV and ProPublica</a> has shown, border centers are the country\u2019s most lucrative collection centers, with the most high-frequency donors.</p> \n<p>To prevent shortages in times of the global pandemic, blood and plasma donation centers in Europe and the UK are now begging healthy donors to continue giving blood and plasma at home. Alexa Wetzel with PPTA told NDR/the Guardian: \u201cIt takes seven to 12 months to produce plasma medication. If the numbers of donations drop now, we will see effects within six or seven months.\u201d Plasma centers in the US and Europe are also taking several safety measures like creating distance between the donors and measuring fever before donations.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3bc5ae583c3f053f6511bd58dc0100c6966ee0b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3bc5ae583c3f053f6511bd58dc0100c6966ee0b/0_0_7415_4776/1000.jpg\" alt=\"donor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"644\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Most donors don\u2019t know if what they are doing is wrong in terms of the legality of using their visa for paid donations.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gabriela Campos/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Experts from health agencies, pharmaceutical companies and not-for-profit blood centers say the coronavirus does not affect the safety of plasma medication. \u201cCorona is a respiratory virus. All respiratory viruses are not transmittable by blood or plasma, Strengers, of the IPFA, told NDR and the Guardian.</p> \n<p>The PPTA issued a <a href=\"https://www.pptaglobal.org/media-and-information/ppta-statements/1055-2019-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-and-plasma-protein-therapies\">statement</a> saying that even if there was plasma collected from an infected donor, the virus would by default be filtered out in the production process.</p> \n<h2><strong>Visas</strong></h2> \n<p>The US-Mexican border appears to have become a big draw for drug companies in need of blood plasma. BPL is one of three main pharmaceutical actors along the border, smaller than the Spanish Grifols and Australian CSL, which have been operating in the border area for years.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/bolsonaro-amlo-coronavirus-warnings\">Bolsonaro and Amlo slammed for snubbing coronavirus warnings</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Most donors don\u2019t know if what they are doing is wrong in terms of the legality of using their visa for paid donations.</p> \n<p>BPL and other pharmaceutical companies based at the border encourage Mexican donors to use B-1/B-2 temporary visas to cross into the US, even though US immigration law explicitly forbids earning money while visiting the country.</p> \n<p>Donation centers get around this language by calling their payments a \u201ccompensation\u201d for time.

  "<p>Universities across the UK have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/17/universities-having-to-adapt-fast-to-the-coronavirus-crisis\">closed down class teaching</a> and are running online seminars and tutorials because of the coronavirus pandemic. The race is on to decide how to handle the summer exams so final-year students can complete their degrees. But there are fears that disadvantaged students could suffer the most through the rapid shift to online learning.</p> <p>Many universities will replace traditional exams with online assessments, as Oxford and Cambridge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/21/oxbridge-to-replace-summer-exams-with-online-assessments-due-to-coronavirus\">announced last week</a>. At Imperial College London, medical students have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-forces-medical-students-sit-final-exams-online\">just </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-forces-medical-students-sit-final-exams-online\">taken</a> unsupervised exams from home for the first time.</p> <p>Some universities are handling the change better than others, according to Dr Doug Clow, who spent 20 years working on remote learning at the Open University and is now advising universities on coronavirus. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that isn\u2019t on fire. Assessment drives what people actually learn, so if you\u2019re changing the assessment you really ought to change how you teach, but there isn\u2019t time for that,\u201d he says.</p> <p>As universities consider their options, one major concern is that disabled and disadvantaged students could be left behind.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/16/it-reduces-surgical-error-can-vr-train-better-doctors\">'It reduces surgical error': can VR train better doctors?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Susie Friedman, who studies sociology at Cambridge University and dictates her exams due to RSI, says changing the format for assessment could be a \u201cmassive problem\u201d for students who may need extra time, invigilators, special software, or optional breaks. \u201cIt\u2019s an additional layer that [doesn\u2019t seem to be] being dealt with,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare.\u201d</p> <p>Students who don\u2019t have access to reliable wifi, expensive computers, or quiet space to sit an exam could struggle too. Eugene Sinclair, a final year architecture student at Edinburgh University, doesn\u2019t know whether he\u2019ll be able to complete his course because he can\u2019t afford a suitable laptop. \u201cI\u2019ve got one that\u2019s OK for surfing the internet,\u201d he says. \u201cBut for architecture you need to be able to do 2D and 3D work. Before, I relied on the university\u2019s computers. Now I don\u2019t feel like I can finish this course because I can\u2019t produce anything.\u201d</p> <p>For these reasons, students from Cambridge, Oxford, Edinburgh, Bristol and University College London have called for an overhaul of final-year assessments, proposing that they are given a choice between taking a mark based on work completed to date or sitting exams later on.</p> <p>Daniel Wittenberg, a languages student at the University of Cambridge, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/17/coronavirus-leaves-universities-with-no-choice-but-to-cancel-our-exams\">says universities</a> should cancel exams. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent our whole lives preparing for a very different type of exam,\u201d he says. \u201cThe university [can\u2019t] pretend this is going to be a real reflection of our abilities.\u201d</p> <p>Sabrina Miller, who studies English literature at the University of Bristol, agrees: \u201cYour grades have a lifelong impact so it\u2019s really stressful.\u201d</p> <p>But delaying exams could have a knock-on effect, too. Employers and professional bodies insist that measures taken during the pandemic must not lead to lower standards.</p> <p>As much as they want fair assessment, students also don\u2019t want the disruption to affect their future work prospects. On Monday, the Junior Lawyers Division sent a letter to the Solicitors Regulatory Authority (SRA) asking it to rethink its decision to push back exams until this autumn, which could leave new graduates unable to take them at all or out of work.</p> <p>In order for assessments to go ahead some exams, such as those at Oxford, will be open book. Another possibility is to run timed, live exams taken from home. \u201cYou could have a webcam to check students aren\u2019t looking stuff up, and find tools to check the typing style is right, or that could lock down the computer if someone is browsing other sites,\u201d says Clow. However this would be intrusive and technologically demanding, so it \u201cprobably isn\u2019t the solution.\u201d</p> <p>The shift to online learning is also an adjustment for lecturers. Many are working hard to come up with innovative ways to keep students engaged online.</p> <p>Sarah Wright, a senior lecturer in primary education at <a href=\"http://ehu.ac.uk/home/emailfooter\">Edge Hill University</a>, says she\u2019s implemented ping pong podcasts, where staff record a podcast for students who then create their own to send back. \u201cThey can get away from their screens and think about generating their own content,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Wright has also been running silent debates, where she puts a provocative statement about education on an online corkboard and students respond using online sticky notes. \u201cStudents are being disconnected from home and from their sole purpose in life and we need to make sure they\u2019re still connected,\u201d she says. \u201cSimply putting up a PowerPoint is not good enough.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jun/03/it-removes-stigma-how-tech-breaks-down-barriers-for-disabled-students\">'It removes stigma': how tech breaks down barriers for students with disabilities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Matt Huxley, a lecturer at Staffordshire University London, uses Microsoft Teams and Discord, a text chat for gamers that is similar to Slack.

  "<p>Nature is sending us a message with the coronavirus pandemic and the ongoing climate crisis, according to the UN\u2019s environment chief, Inger Andersen.</p> <p>Andersen said humanity was placing too many pressures on the natural world with damaging consequences, and warned that failing to take care of the planet meant not taking care of ourselves.</p> <p>Leading scientists also said the Covid-19 outbreak was a \u201cclear warning shot\u201d, given that far more deadly diseases existed in wildlife, and that today\u2019s civilisation was \u201cplaying with fire\u201d. They said it was almost always human behaviour that caused diseases to spill over into humans.</p> <p>To prevent further outbreaks, the experts said, both global heating and the destruction of the natural world for farming, mining and housing have to end, as both drive wildlife into contact with people.</p> <p>They also urged authorities to put an end to live animal markets \u2013 which they called an \u201cideal mixing bowl\u201d for disease \u2013 and the illegal global animal trade.</p> <p>Andersen, executive director of the UN Environment Programme, said the immediate priority was to protect people from the coronavirus and prevent its spread. \u201cBut our long-term response must tackle habitat and biodiversity loss,\u201d she added.</p> <p>\u201cNever before have so many opportunities existed for pathogens to pass from wild and domestic animals to people,\u201d she told the Guardian, explaining that <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11516376\">75% of all emerging infectious diseases come from wildlife</a>.</p> <p>\u201cOur continued erosion of wild spaces has brought us uncomfortably close to animals and plants that harbour diseases that can jump to humans.\u201d</p> <p>She also noted other environmental impacts, such as the Australian bushfires, broken heat records and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/20/locust-crisis-poses-a-danger-to-millions-forecasters-warn?utm_campaign=Carbon%20Brief%20Daily%20Briefing&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">worst locust invasion</a> in Kenya for 70 years. \u201cAt the end of the day, [with] all of these events, nature is sending us a message,\u201d Anderson said.</p> <p>\u201cThere are too many pressures at the same time on our natural systems and something has to give,\u201d she added. \u201cWe are intimately interconnected with nature, whether we like it or not. If we don\u2019t take care of nature, we can\u2019t take care of ourselves. And as we hurtle towards a population of 10 billion people on this planet, we need to go into this future armed with nature as our strongest ally.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"548b775b3ffce5e9a1b62c70c8b0e241c53c1277\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/548b775b3ffce5e9a1b62c70c8b0e241c53c1277/0_0_1235_820/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An orangutan seeks refuge from a bulldozer as loggers smash the base of a tree in the Ketapang district, West Borneo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An orangutan seeks refuge from a bulldozer as loggers smash the base of a tree in the Ketapang district, West Borneo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: International Animal Rescue</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Human infectious disease outbreaks are rising and in recent years there have been Ebola, bird flu, Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), Rift Valley fever, severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), West Nile virus and Zika virus all cross from animals to humans.</p> <p>\u201cThe emergence and spread of Covid-19 was not only predictable, it was predicted [in the sense that] there would be another viral emergence from wildlife that would be a public health threat,\u201d said Prof Andrew Cunningham, of the Zoological Society of London. A 2007 <a href=\"https://cmr.asm.org/content/cmr/20/4/660.full.pdf\">study of the 2002-</a><a href=\"https://cmr.asm.org/content/cmr/20/4/660.full.pdf\">03 Sars outbreak</a> concluded: \u201cThe presence of a large reservoir of Sars-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats, together with the culture of eating exotic mammals in southern China, is a timebomb.\u201d</p> <p>Cunningham said other diseases from wildlife had much higher fatality rates in people, such as 50% for Ebola and 60%-75% for Nipah virus, transmitted from bats in south Asia. \u201cAlthough, you might not think it at the moment, we\u2019ve probably got a bit lucky with [Covid-19],\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think we should be taking this as a clear warning shot.

Markets butchering live wild animals from far and wide are the most obvious example, he said. A market in China is believed to have been the source of Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cThe animals have been transported over large distances and are crammed together into cages. They are stressed and immunosuppressed and excreting whatever pathogens they have in them,\u201d he said. \u201cWith people in large numbers in the market and in intimate contact with the body fluids of these animals, you have an ideal mixing bowl for [disease] emergence. If you wanted a scenario to maximise the chances of [transmission], I couldn\u2019t think of a much better way of doing it.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/china-bans-wildlife-trade-consumption-coronavirus-2020-2\">China has banned such markets</a>, and Cunningham said this must be permanent. \u201cHowever, this needs to be done globally. There are wet markets throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa and a lot of other Asian countries too.\u201d The ease of travel in the modern world exacerbates the dangers, he said, adding: \u201cThese days, you can be in a central African rainforest one day and in central London the next.\u201d</p> <p>Aaron Bernstein, at the Harvard School of Public Health in the US, said the destruction of natural places drives wildlife to live close to people and that climate change was also forcing animals to move: \u201cThat creates an opportunity for pathogens to get into new hosts.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had Sars, Mers, Covid-19, HIV. We need to see what nature is trying to tell us here. We need to recognise that we\u2019re playing with fire,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe separation of health and environmental policy is a \u200bdangerous delusion. Our health entirely depends on the climate and the other organisms we share the planet with.\u201d</p> <p>The billion-dollar illegal wildlife trade is another part of the problem, said John Scanlon, the former secretary general of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca767de98bdbe90cbd51dab496f9f7ff75934fd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca767de98bdbe90cbd51dab496f9f7ff75934fd6/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thousands of frozen pangolins lie in a pit before being burnt in Indonesia, after a pangolin bust conducted by the police.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thousands of frozen pangolins lie in a pit before being burnt in Indonesia, after a pangolin bust conducted by the police.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Hilton/WCS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cImporting countries should create a new legal obligation, supported by criminal sanctions, for an importer of wildlife to prove that it was legally obtained under the source country\u2019s national laws,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can blend taking a hard line against transnational organised wildlife criminals, while also opening up new opportunities for local communities, then we will see biodiversity, ecosystems and communities thrive.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The Covid-19 crisis may provide an opportunity for change, but Cunningham is not convinced it will be taken: \u201cI thought things would have changed after Sars, which was a massive wake up call \u2013 the biggest economic impact of any emerging disease to that date,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody was up in arms about it.

For children, it\u2019s a tough start to life. Ana Farias, headteacher of an early-years school in a low-income neighbourhood controlled by a gang, knows this only too well. Some of her students wouldn\u2019t eat if it were not for free school meals.</p> \n<p>Farias and her colleagues often hear stories of home life; some children have to accompany their mothers who sell sex at night. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge but it motivates me to be here every day.

Yet, Sobral has gone through an extraordinary metamorphosis and is now the best place in Brazil to get a state education.</p> \n<p>The city comes <a href=\"https://cidades.ibge.gov.br/brasil/ce/sobral/panorama\">top of 5,000 districts</a> in Brazil\u2019s education development index. Fifteen years ago, it was ranked 1,366th. Since 2015, literacy rates have risen from 52% to 92%, and the <a href=\"http://sedhas.sobral.ce.gov.br/programas/bolsa-familia\">number of families living in extreme poverty</a> has declined by 89%.</p> \n<p>This is a stunning turnaround in a country beset by income inequality and poor literacy rates: <a href=\"https://agenciadenoticias.ibge.gov.br/media/com_mediaibge/arquivos/00e02a8bb67cdedc4fb22601ed264c00.pdf\">half of state-educated students are still illiterate</a> by the third grade.</p> \n<p>So what has been Sobral\u2019s secret to success? The mayor, Ivo Gomes, says: \u201cWe have reached this position because this is a 23-year-old project that has surpassed changes in mayors and secretaries of education. People think it\u2019s magic and it\u2019s not. It is persistence and a lot of hard work.\u201d</p> \n<p>In 1997, the movement to improve education in Sobral began with renovating school buildings and furnishing them with computers and other resources. Public spending on education was boosted.</p> \n<p>In the past, politicians had commonly rewarded allies by handing out government jobs, including headteacher posts to people who could barely read or write. This practice was stamped out.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bdfcca9a7dff3e4cc62127a97def8b96bbc26e7e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdfcca9a7dff3e4cc62127a97def8b96bbc26e7e/0_200_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Sobal child writing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Literacy rates in the city have improved since 2015 from 52% to 92%.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Educa\u00e7\u00e3o de Sobral</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There was a crackdown on truancy; today families are called if their children don\u2019t turn up to school. Newly qualified teachers now undergo a preparatory internship and all teachers, regardless of experience, receive on-the-job training for a day each month. Every term there is a bonus system for teachers whose students perform well in assessments.</p> \n<p>Student welfare is a high priority; pupils receive two free school meals a day and there are plans to hire a mental health professional in each school.</p> \n<p>All this has led in part to the success of former students such as Chelton Santos, 22, and his sister Maria, 20. The siblings live with their parents and grandmother in a poor and dangerous area.

I\u2019ve seen my mother suffer with health problems since I was a child and now I want to help the poorest in society.\u201d</p> \n<p>Their mother, Eliane, is hopeful about her children\u2019s future: \u201cI never believed that one day my son would be studying to be a lawyer at university. We did everything we could to keep [the children] in school. I wanted to give them a nicer place to live \u2026 it\u2019s dangerous here. God willing, they\u2019re going to move from here to a better life.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sobral\u2019s success is now being replicated across the country. Clodoveu Arruda, a former mayor of the city, who oversaw a large part of the transformation in the education department, has teamed up with the <a href=\"https://fundacaolemann.org.br/en\">Lemann Foundation</a> to spread best practice. So far they have worked in 25 municipalities across five states.</p> \n<p>Not everyone in Sobral is content with what has been achieved, however \u2013 they are hungry for further success. The mayor, Gomes, says: \u201cBeing the top in Brazil doesn\u2019t mean much if you look at the rest of the world.

  "<p><strong>I received a \u00a330 penalty charge notice (PCN) plus a \u00a342 admin fee from Hertz for an alleged bus lane contravention in my hire car.

I raised my complaint as far as the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA), which said that while it\u2019s \u201cbest practice\u201d, wherever possible, for a rental company to transfer liability to the hirer, there\u2019s no legal or code-of-practice requirement. </strong></p> <p><strong>Councils get to keep lots of invalid penalty fines and rental companies charge lots of excessive \u201cadmin fees\u201d.

Our rental terms cover both of these options. In the majority of cases, we transfer the liability, but an authority can ask for direct payment or we may make a decision to pay the fine based on our experience of an authority\u2019s previous requests.\u201d</p> <p>You can actually appeal against a fine, even if it has been paid by a rental company, although bus lane contraventions are notoriously difficult to challenge.

The switch was so sudden that commuters paused to take photos.</p> \n<p>The countdown clock will be reset as soon as organisers and the International Olympic Committee [IOC] decide when, exactly, a supposedly post-<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak/all\">coronavirus</a> world is ready for the second coming of the Tokyo Games.</p> \n<p>Hours after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan\">Japan</a>\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, confirmed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/24/tokyo-olympics-to-be-postponed-to-2021-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic\">the Games would be held \u201cno later than next summer\u201d</a>, some Tokyoites were conflicted about their reaction.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/24/tokyo-olympics-to-be-postponed-to-2021-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic\">Tokyo Olympics postponed to 2021 due to coronavirus pandemic</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Emi Hagino, a media consultant who was born and raised in the capital, said she had initially accepted the delay as inevitable, but then felt \u201cmassively let down\u201d, as it would affect her business.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy parents remember watching the 1964 Olympics here, so they have experienced it before, but for me it was going to be a magical once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to actually see the world\u2019s biggest sporting event with my own eyes, with everyone\u2019s focus on my city,\u201d she said. \u201cI can wait for another year, but please, no longer.\u201d</p> \n<p>Koichi Teratani, who blogs about the city\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/10/tokyo-big-year-is-the-impenetrable-city-finally-opening-up\">Kabukicho</a> entertainment district \u2013 a popular destination among Chinese tourists \u2013 said the postponement was a second blow for local businesses still reeling from the financial costs inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cHotels are already struggling from cancellations, so the smaller ones that don\u2019t have the means to weather the storm face even more uncertainty,\u201d said Teratani, who had just started printing 40,000 copies of a bilingual guidebook to Kabukicho \u2013 an area packed with thousands of bars, restaurants and clubs \u2013 hand out to visitors during the Olympics when the postponement was announced.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe can hang on to them for another year, even though some of the information might be a bit out of date,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"19c1502c-287f-4589-8d1b-ef360eccdb91\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-DNXY0T6QvY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There was disappointment that the spectacle, more than six years in the planning, had been delayed, but relief, too, both that the speculation of recent weeks had ended and, crucially, that Abe and the IOC president, Thomas Bach, had agreed that cancellation was out of the question.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think the Japanese government and the IOC had no choice but to postpone, because holding the Olympics without athletes from around the word would have run counter to the Olympic Charter,\u201d said Akino Yoshihara, a Kyoto-based translator who had been looking forward to watching track and field events.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt would have been unfair if some athletes had been denied the opportunity to compete because of the coronavirus situation in their countries.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yujiro Nakao, a Tokyo company employee, agreed that a delay was the only sensible response to the outbreak, but said he had \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about not being able to see athletes who had spent years preparing for the biggest moment of their careers.</p> \n<p>The first postponement in the Olympics\u2019 124-year modern history is expected to create a financial headache for the myriad businesses with a financial stake in the Games.</p> \n<p>The IOC and local organisers will have to renegotiate contracts with official broadcasters and sponsors, and extend rent agreements on venues that, until Tuesday, were to have served their purpose by the time the Paralympics ended in early September.</p> \n<p>The Nikkei business delay reported on Wednesday that the organising committee estimates that the postponement will raise the total cost for the Games by 300bn yen ($2.7 billion) due to additional labour and other costs. There is no guarantee, either, that the 80,000 volunteers who were due to descend on Tokyo this summer will be available next year.</p> \n<p>\u201cObviously, the celebratory mood of the Olympics had already been fading due to the coronavirus,\u201d an official from one of the Games\u2019 sponsors told the newspaper. \u201cPerhaps it would not have been fully welcomed if the Games had gone on as scheduled. We just need to start afresh.\u201d</p> \n<p>The general mood was best summed up by the Japanese phrase <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/27/10-of-the-best-words-in-the-world-that-dont-translate-into-english\">shikata ga nai</a></em> (it can\u2019t be helped) \u2013 a catchall response to any situation, large or small, over which people believe they have no influence. Recent polls indicated that about 70% of Japanese people had resigned themselves to a postponement as soon as it became clear that the coronavirus was going to take months, possibly much longer, to bring under control.</p> \n<p>Ami Takada, a recent high school graduate, was among those enjoying the spring sunshine in Tokyo on Wednesday who wondered if a one-year delay would be long enough, given the virus\u2019s seemingly unstoppable onslaught.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf they don\u2019t hold the Olympics [in 2021], it will be the end for the Japanese economy\u201d she said.</p>",

There is a range of espionage offences under Chinese law, carrying penalties from three years in jail to the death penalty.</p> <p>There are serious and growing concerns about Yang\u2019s treatment under interrogation inside a Beijing state security detention centre.</p> <p>Sources have told the Guardian that Yang, formerly a diplomat for China\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs, has been \u201ctotally isolated\u201d since December, with no phone calls, correspondence, or consular visits. No messages from family or friends, or any reports from the outside world have been passed on.</p> <p>Previously, he was allowed one half-hour consular visit a month.</p> <p>Reports of Yang\u2019s detention reveal he had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/28/yang-hengjun-detained-blogger-is-being-shackled-in-chains-and-interrogated\">held for months in solitary confinement and been shackled</a> \u2013 bound by manacles on his wrists and ankles \u2013 for long interrogation sessions. The lights in his cell remain on 24 hours a day, and he is repeatedly interrogated with the same questions.</p> <p>Meetings with his lawyers had been refused.</p> <p>Earlier reports also suggest that Yang had pronounced difficulty walking, was being medicated, ostensibly for blood pressure issues, and was suffering from serious memory loss and dizziness. He has been reported as being pale and having lost more than 10 kilograms in weight.</p> <p>Under constant monitoring, he had been forced to sit on a low stool from 7am to midnight every day, allowed to stand for a few minutes each hour.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2015/05/13/tiger-chairs-and-cell-bosses/police-torture-criminal-suspects-china\">Human Rights Watch has reported in detail</a> about the interrogation techniques used against political prisoners in China, including the use of sustained sleep deprivation, stress positions, and forcible restraints, such as so-called tiger chairs.</p> <p>Payne said the Australian government had repeatedly told China that basic international standards of justice, procedural fairness and humane treatment must apply to Yang, and others held in China\u2019s criminal justice system.</p> <p>\u201cWe deeply regret that for over a year, our requests have not been taken up. Dr Yang has had no access to legal representation and has been held in harsh conditions that have been detrimental to his physical and mental health.</p> <p>Payne said Australia had not been given any advice on Yang\u2019s indictment.</p> <p>She said the current global Covid-19 pandemic was an opportunity for international cooperation.</p> <p>\u201cCrises are a time for nations to pull together. It is not in the spirit of mutual respect and trust that our continued advocacy for Dr Yang has not been acknowledged.</p> <p>Dr Feng Chongyi, associate professor in China Studies at University of Technology Sydney and Yang\u2019s doctoral supervisor in Australia, said Yang\u2019s incarceration was politically motivated.</p> <p>\u201cFrom day one, this has been a politically motivated charge. It has been done to serve two political purposes, one is to silence dissenting voices, the other is to exercise pressure on the Australian government in dealing with the Huawei case.\u201d</p> <p>The conviction rate for those tried on accusation of a crime in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a> is 99%, in a criminal justice system almost entirely reliant on \u201cconfessions\u201d obtained through long, secretive detentions.</p> <p>Feng, also previously detained in China, told the Guardian \u201cI have no faith in the Chinese legal system to grant Dr Yang a fair trial.\u201d</p> <p>China has consistently maintained that Yang\u2019s case was being prosecuted according to law, and has <a href=\"https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/t1692308.shtml\">warned Australia against \u201cinterference\u201d</a> in the case.</p> <p>\u201cThe Australian side should earnestly respect China\u2019s judicial sovereignty and must not \u2026 interfere with a Chinese case,\u201d a spokesman for China\u2019s foreign ministry, Geng Shuang, said last year.</p> <p>Geng said Yang\u2019s arrest had been handled in accordance with the law and that the Australian citizen was in good health.</p> <p>Yaqiu Wang, China researcher for Human Rights Watch, said: \u201cThe Chinese government\u2019s treatment of Yang has been appalling. He has been kept in harsh conditions and denied access to a lawyer of his choosing and to his family.</p> <p>\u201cThe Chinese government has a long history of criminalising its critics under vague charges of \u2018endangering nation\u2019s security.\u2019 The Australian government should work with other governments who also have citizens wrongfully detained in China to put pressure on the Chinese government.\u201d</p> <p>Born in Hubei province in 1965, Yang was formerly a diplomat for China\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs, and worked for the ministry of state security \u2013 the agency that arrested him \u2013 before moving into the private sector in Hong Kong and moving to the US, then to Australia.</p> <p>A writer of spy novels, he has been a popular blogger, political commentator and agitator for democratic reforms in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a> for more than a decade, describing himself as a \u201cdemocracy pedlar\u201d and earning the opprobrium of the government he had once served.</p> <p>Yang, who became an Australian citizen in 2002, had been living in the United States, where he was a visiting scholar at Columbia University, before flying to Guangzhou with his family in January. His wife and child were able to enter China, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/23/friends-fear-australian-writer-yang-hengjun-has-been-detained-in-china\">authorities escorted Yang from the plane into detention</a>.</p> <p>Yang\u2019s wife, Yuan Xiaoliang, an Australian permanent resident, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/08/wife-of-detained-australian-writer-yang-hengjun-banned-from-leaving-china\">has been banned from leaving China</a>.</p> <p><br><br></p>",

All this is lost if a child isn\u2019t in school, and, even with the government\u2019s announcement, most won\u2019t be.\u201d</p> <p>With many children\u2019s centres, nurseries, libraries and youth services closed down or cut, \u201cthere will be the best part of 1 million children who have needed a social worker in the past three years now becoming invisible to professionals, just as their families come under unprecedented strain\u201d, adds Longfield. </p> <p>Even for those children who are in care, stability cannot be guaranteed. Foster carers are increasingly anxious about the capacity of the system to support them when social workers \u2013 already a scarce resource \u2013 fall ill or self-isolate. \u201cThere will be [foster] placement breakdowns because of this situation,\u201d says Jane Collins, director of the <a href=\"https://www.ifcalliance.co.uk/\">Independent Foster Carers Alliance</a>.</p> <p>If payments to fostering agencies and individual foster carers don\u2019t take place smoothly, once council finance departments are operating remotely from home, it won\u2019t be long before the fostering system is in dire straits, warns Andy Elvin, chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.tactcare.org.uk/\">Tact Fostering and Adoption charity</a>. A foster carer\u2019s allowance pays for the children\u2019s food, household bills, clothes and activities. \u201cIt\u2019s the money for foster carers to be able to look after the children,\u201d says Elvin. There has been \u201cradio silence\u201d, he says, from all but three of the 60-odd local authorities he has contacted about this issue: those three have confirmed their systems will cope.</p> <p>Foster carers also worry about how to reconcile government calls for social distancing for court-ordered contact with birth families, which could put everyone at further risk. This family time, crucial to maintaining children\u2019s relationships with parents and siblings, often has to be monitored by \u201ccontact supervisors\u201d in council offices. Emily Boardman, a partner at Boardman, Hawkins and Osborne solicitors who represents parents in care proceedings, says it is unclear what will happen if contact centres shut. \u201cMy clients are very anxious about what plans can be put in place to ensure that contact doesn\u2019t stop altogether for a long time,\u201d Boardman explains. \u201cImagine being a parent away from their child at this time, not seeing them and not being able to be with them if they get ill.\u201d</p> <p>She urges councils to be \u201c imaginative and open to ensuring contact continues, if at all possible\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This could tip many kinship carers over the edge</p> <footer> <cite>Lucy Peake, chief executive of the charity Grandparents Plus</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Martin Barrow, a foster carer and campaigner, says some foster carers are already battling to maintain this contact digitally, with a number of councils insisting that it happens in person, despite the obvious health risks. Others are stopping contact altogether, in breach of the law.</p> <p>According to Cathy Ashley, chief executive of Family Rights Group, which advises parents with children in need, in some cases contact has been summarily stopped on a social worker\u2019s say-so. \u201cLocal authorities need to bring a nuanced approach to this issue,\u201d she says. </p> <p>One of the most hidden groups of vulnerable children is the estimated 200,000 under-18s who would probably be in care but for a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.bristol.ac.uk/media-library/sites/policybristol/briefings-and-reports-pdfs/2017-briefings--reports-pdfs/PolicyBristol_Report_November_2017_Kinship_Care.pdf\">kinship carer</a>\u201d having stepped in.

  "<p>We have been living in a bubble, a bubble of false comfort and denial. In the rich nations, we have begun to believe we have transcended the material world. The wealth we\u2019ve accumulated \u2013 often at the expense of others \u2013 has shielded us from reality. Living behind screens, passing between capsules \u2013 our houses, cars, offices and shopping malls \u2013 we persuaded ourselves that contingency had retreated, that we had reached the point all civilisations seek: insulation from natural hazards.</p> <p>Now the membrane has ruptured, and we find ourselves naked and outraged, as the biology we appeared to have banished <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/23/icu-doctors-tough-decisions-coronavirus-uk\">storms through our lives</a>. The temptation, when this pandemic has passed, will be to find another bubble. We cannot afford to succumb to it. From now on, we should expose our minds to the painful realities we have denied for too long.</p> <p>The planet has multiple morbidities, some of which will make this coronavirus look, by comparison, easy to treat. One above all others has come to obsess me in recent years: how will we feed ourselves? Fights over toilet paper are ugly enough: I hope we never have to witness fights over food. But it\u2019s becoming difficult to see how we will avoid them.</p> <p>A large body of evidence is beginning to accumulate showing how climate breakdown is likely to affect our food supply. Already farming in some parts of the world is being <a href=\"https://nexusmedianews.com/drought-is-crippling-small-farmers-in-mexico-with-consequences-for-everyone-else-photos-73b35a01e4dd\">hammered by drought</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/climate/farms-climate-change-crops.html\">floods</a>, <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/farmers-count-cost-of-fires-but-hopes-new-vintage-not-up-in-smoke-20191228-p53nbb.html\">fire</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/20/locust-crisis-poses-a-danger-to-millions-forecasters-warn\">locusts</a> (whose resurgence in the past few weeks appears to be the result of <a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/20032020/locust-swarms-climate-change\">anomalous tropical cyclones</a>). When we call such hazards \u201cbiblical\u201d, we mean that they are the kind of things that happened long ago, to people whose lives we can scarcely imagine. Now, with increasing frequency, they are happening to us.</p> <p>In his forthcoming book, <a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.co.uk/9780008308599/our-final-warning-six-degrees-of-climate-emergency/\">Our Final Warning</a>, Mark Lynas explains what is likely to happen to our food supply with every extra degree of global heating. He finds that extreme danger kicks in somewhere between 3C and 4C above pre-industrial levels. At this point, a series of interlocking impacts threatens to send food production into a death spiral. Outdoor temperatures become <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(18)30240-7/fulltext\">too high for humans to tolerate</a>, making subsistence farming impossible across Africa and South Asia. Livestock die from heat stress. Temperatures start to <a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/financial/2017docs/usa-climateagro.pdf\">exceed the lethal thresholds</a><a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/financial/2017docs/usa-climateagro.pdf\"> for crop plants</a> across much of the world, and major food producing regions turn into <a href=\"https://epic.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/nplants2016193.pdf\">dust bowls</a>. Simultaneous <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/115/26/6644\">global harvest failure</a> \u2013 something that has never happened in the modern world \u2013 becomes highly likely.</p> <p>In combination with a rising human population, and the loss of irrigation water, soil and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/19/us-beekeepers-lost-40-of-honeybee-colonies-over-past-year-survey-finds\">pollinators</a>, this could push the world into structural famine. Even today, when the world has a total food surplus, hundreds of millions are malnourished as a result of the unequal distribution of wealth and power. A food deficit could result in billions starving. Hoarding will happen, as it always has, at the global level, as powerful people snatch food from the mouths of the poor. Yet, even if every nation keeps <a href=\"http://paris-equity-check.org/warming-check\">its promises under the Paris </a><a href=\"http://paris-equity-check.org/warming-check\">agreement</a>, which currently seems unlikely, global heating will amount to between 3C and 4C.</p> <p>Thanks to our illusion of security, we are doing almost nothing to anticipate this catastrophe, let alone prevent it. This existential issue scarcely seems to impinge on our consciousness. Every food-producing sector claims that its own current practices are sustainable and don\u2019t need to change. When I challenge them, I\u2019m met with a barrage of anger and abuse, and threats of the kind I haven\u2019t experienced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/nov/26/foreignpolicy.iraq\">since I opposed the Iraq </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/nov/26/foreignpolicy.iraq\">war</a>. Sacred cows and holy lambs are everywhere, and the thinking required to develop the new food systems that we need, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/08/lab-grown-food-destroy-farming-save-planet\">lab-grown food, </a>is scarcely anywhere.</p> <p>But this is just one of our impending crises. Antibiotic resistance is, potentially, as deadly as any new disease. One of the causes is the astonishingly profligate way in which these precious medicines are used on <a href=\"http://www.saveourantibiotics.org/media/1773/farm-antibiotic-use-in-the-united-states.pdf\">many livestock farms</a>. Where vast numbers of farm animals are packed together, antibiotics are deployed prophylactically to prevent otherwise inevitable outbreaks of disease. In some parts of the world, they are used not only to prevent disease, but also as growth promoters. Low doses are routinely added to feed: a strategy that could scarcely be better designed to <a href=\"http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/136454/e94889.pdf\">deliver bacterial resistance</a>.</p> <p>In the US, where 27 million people have no medical cover, some people are now treating themselves with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/11/fish-antibiotics-human-use-cheaper-than-doctor\">veterinary antibiotics</a>, including those sold, without prescription, to medicate pet fish. Pharmaceutical companies are failing to invest sufficiently in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/mar/24/the-drugs-dont-work-what-happens-after-antibiotics\">search for new drugs</a>. If antibiotics cease to be effective, surgery becomes almost impossible. Childbirth becomes a mortal hazard once more. Chemotherapy can no longer be safely practised. Infectious diseases we have comfortably forgotten become deadly threats. We should discuss this issue as often as we talk about football. But again, it scarcely registers.</p> <p>Our multiple crises, of which these are just two, have a common root. The problem is exemplified by the response of the organisers of the <a href=\"https://bathhalf.co.uk/2020/03/covid-19-update/\">Bath Half Marathon</a>, a massive event that took place on 15 March, to the many people begging them to cancel. \u201cIt is now too late for us to cancel or postpone the event. The venue is built, the infrastructure is in place, the site and our contractors are ready.\u201d In other words, the sunk costs of the event were judged to outweigh any future impacts \u2013 the potential transmission of disease, and possible deaths \u2013 it might cause.</p> <p>The amount of time it took the International Olympic Committee to postpone the Games could reflect similar judgments \u2013 but at least they got there in the end.<strong> </strong>Sunk costs within the fossil fuel industry, farming, banking, private healthcare and other sectors prevent the rapid transformations we need. Money becomes more important than life.</p> <p>There are two ways this could go. We could, as some people have done, double down on denial. Some of those who have dismissed other threats, such as climate breakdown, also seek to downplay the threat of Covid-19. Witness the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/brazils-jair-bolsonaro-says-coronavirus-crisis-is-a-media-trick\">claims that the coronavirus is nothing more than \u201ca little flu\u201d</a>. The media and opposition politicians who have called for lockdown are, apparently, part of a conspiracy against him.</p> <p>Or this could be the moment when we begin to see ourselves, once more, as governed by biology and physics, and dependent on a habitable planet. Never again should we listen to the liars and the deniers. Never again should we allow a comforting falsehood to trounce a painful truth. No longer can we afford to be dominated by those who put money ahead of life. This coronavirus reminds us that we belong to the material world.</p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>For those staying at home during the pandemic, the entertainment options might soon run low. There are only so many podcasts released each week, and streaming TV shows and films for 18 hours straight is no more practical than reading books all day, if one has to be moving around cooking, exercising, or preventing small children from maiming themselves with unexpected household objects. So perhaps the long-form audiobook deserves a top slot in the menu of, I\u2019m sorry, quarantainment.</p> <p>This might be a good chance to catch up on classics from previous centuries. An unavoidable monument here \u2013 and already a recent bestseller on <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/?lohp=2\">Scribd</a>, which has just announced that all its books and audiobooks will be available free for 30 days \u2014 is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jan/05/albert-camus-the-plague-fascist-death-ed-vulliamy\">The Plague by Albert Camus</a>. This is the tale of a small French-Algerian town cut off from the outside world after an outbreak of bubonic plague, which its citizens at first refuse to believe is a serious threat. The central character, a doctor, remarks that his fellow townspeople in this respect \u201cwere like everybody else, wrapped up in themselves; in other words, they were humanists: they disbelieved in pestilences. A pestilence isn\u2019t a thing made to man\u2019s measure; therefore we tell ourselves that pestilence is a mere bogy of the mind, a bad dream that will pass away.\u201d</p> <p>Long celebrated as a masterful allegory of Nazi occupation, The Plague is also a story of qualified hope, as a kind of existential solidarity persists while the storm rages outside. Some British listeners might, however, find themselves irritated by the American-accented narration in the only audiobook edition, which has a certain amount of trouble with the French names, and opt instead for Daniel Defoe\u2019s grisly yet also undespairing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/plague-coronavirus-british-panic-buying\">A Journal of the Plague Year</a> (1722), as narrated in the reassuringly Beebish tones of Andrew Cullum.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfcc45e1d1bd0a9da98eecc2b38f8aaa5f365565\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfcc45e1d1bd0a9da98eecc2b38f8aaa5f365565/0_104_1527_916/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Never read Homer\u2019s Odyssey?

If there is an ultra-endurance champion among audiobook readers, it must be the late actor Neville Jason, who recorded every single word (there are more than a million) of Proust\u2019s great novel sequence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/nov/02/classics.marcelproust\">In Search of Lost Time</a> (or, in the Scott Moncrieff translation used for the audiobook, originally Remembrance of Things Past). It runs to 150 hours, or a bit less than a couple of hours every day for 12 weeks. At one point in the third volume, Proust\u2019s narrator remarks: \u201cIt is illness that makes us recognise that we do not live in isolation but are chained to a being from a different realm, worlds apart from us and by whom it is impossible to make ourselves understood: our body.\u201d</p> <p>The vagaries of this being from a different realm are the subject of Bill Bryson\u2019s most recent book, narrated with his usual charm by the author himself. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/26/the-body-guide-for-occupants-bill-bryson-review\">The Body</a> is ideal for the audio format, being a warm and engaging tour through the amazing facts of human physiology, with plenty of \u201cdid you know?\u201d moments to keep the household entertained. Did you know, for example, that scientists have determined that scratching your back gives the most long-lasting relief, but scratching your ankle brings the most pleasure?</p> <p>The more you learn about your body, the more of a miracle it seems, if you\u2019re lucky enough to have one that is still more or less in working order, even if no pandemic is raging. At one point Bryson, who throughout assumes a rather portly audience, exhorts you to \u201cget up and move around a little\u201d. This is rather difficult if one is reading, and wants to continue reading, the print version, but it\u2019s fine advice for the shut-in listener.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6d3e62ba594b70aa9c1c05f1375d9787dedaa1ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d3e62ba594b70aa9c1c05f1375d9787dedaa1ea/0_0_500_500/500.jpg\" alt=\"The audiobook of The Plague by Albert Camus.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The audiobook of The Plague by Albert Camus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Recorded Books</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More purely escapist comfort listening is the classic BBC dramatisation of all of John le Carr\u00e9\u2019s classic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/22/le-carre-call-for-the-dead\">George Smiley books</a>: nowadays the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/cold-war\">cold war</a> represents a simpler, even cosier time in the popular imagination, and Smiley himself, an owlish wanderer through the world\u2019s shades of grey, represents in some ways the kind of prime minister we are not allowed to have any more. He is played in this \u201cfull-cast audiobook\u201d (jargon for, essentially, a repackaged radio drama) by the great Simon Russell Beale.</p> <p>And if that still proves a little too this-worldly, there are more fantastical options. Those who like their medieval fantasy nonsense with a side order of sarcastic wit and catchy songs will have been bereft once they\u2019d finished bingeing on the first season of The Witcher, starring as the grey-ponytailed monster hunter. A diversion for the ears while fans wait for the second TV series are the audiobooks of the original novels by Andrzej Sapkowski. They begin with the gloriously titled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jun/19/1\">Blood of Elves</a>, which may recall the deathless comment of literary scholar Hugo Dyson, who was one of the \u201cInklings\u201d to whom Tolkien used to read instalments of Lord of the Rings. On one such occasion, Dyson is said to have groaned: \u201cOh fuck, not another elf.\u201d</p> <p>A serene attitude towards the undesired appearance of elves, as well as towards much else, was cultivated by the great Stoics of classical times, among them the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/apr/05/featuresreviews.guardianreview6\">Meditations</a>, read in suitably imperial manner by Duncan Steen, are more authentically inspiring than any modern \u201cinspirational\u201d memes \u2013 and often quite funny. \u201cThe object of life is not to be on the side of the majority,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut to avoid finding oneself among the ranks of the insane.\u201d And remember: \u201cThe art of living is more like wrestling than dancing, in so far as it stands ready against the accidental and the unforeseen, and is not apt to fall.\u201d</p> <p>If, as a kind of exercise in meditating upon how things could be even worse, you wish to catch up on the latest expert thinking about alternative apocalypses, there is Stuart Russell\u2019s excellent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/24/human-compatible-ai-problem-control-stuart-russell-review\">Human Compatible: AI and the Problem of Control</a>, read by Raphael Corkhill. Russell, a pioneer in machine intelligence, here considers the increasingly fashionable subject of what to do if a superintelligent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/artificialintelligenceai\">AI</a> is created and then takes over the world \u2013 or rather, how to stop that from happening.</p> <p>He provides a vivid and clear history of computing, and explains the problems inherent in trying to \u201cload\u201d values into AI so as to prevent it from trying to destroy us. He concludes that trying to give it any values at all is a mug\u2019s game. Instead, the AI should be taught a humble attention to humans\u2019 wishes.

Writing prose and being able to read aloud in such a way as to hold a listener\u2019s attention are two entirely different skills that happen to coexist in one person only by pure coincidence. One delightful such coincidence is novelist Anne Enright, whose performance of her own widely admired new novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/14/actress-anne-enright-review\">Actress</a>, brings out all the mischievous empathy of her writing. Perhaps it is something to do with being Irish, because Marian Keyes also reads her new book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/07/grown-ups-marian-keyes-review-adult-life\">Grown Ups</a>, with a nicely understated wit.</p> <p>In a way, David Cameron is also the ideal reader of his own work, if only because you would feel sorry for anyone else who had to do it.

  "<p>Crip Camp, Netflix\u2019s feelgood documentary executive-produced by the Obamas, begins out of the spotlight: at a hippy summer camp in the early 1970s called Camp Jened in which teens hang out, hook up and mess around in the mountains adjacent, both physically and spiritually, to Woodstock. The campers at Jened, however, are all disabled teens, and Jened offers a rare utopia of what a world centered on their perspective could be. The camp\u2019s radical vision, it turns out, has shaped decades of activism; the film, which premiered to rave reviews at Sundance in January, traces the long arc of Jened\u2019s foundational influence for a generation of civil rights activists, as many ex-Jenedians fought in the oft-underplayed story of the disability rights movement in America.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/24/crip-camp-review-rousing-netflix-documentary-traces-disability-rights-movement\">Crip Camp review \u2013 rousing Netflix documentary traces disability rights movement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The idea for a film on Jened began with an off-hand comment at lunch. Jim LeBrecht, an award-winning sound designer for film and theater based in Oakland, California, had worked on several documentaries, including three films over the course of 15 years with Nicole Newnham as co-director. But LeBrecht, who was born with spina bifida and uses a wheelchair, had never seen one related to his life\u2019s work as a disability rights advocate. At the end of one lunch pitch meeting, he mentioned: \u201c\u2018You know, I\u2019ve always wanted to see this film made about my summer camp,\u2019\u201d Newnham recalled to the Guardian. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s nice, why?\u2019 And then he completely blew my mind.\u201d</p> <p>Camp Jened, which LeBrecht attended at the age of 15 in 1971, offered disabled teens a sense of normalcy often not found at home. Everyone had some bodily concern or limitation, so no one was the stigmatized odd one out. The world, for once, did not assume an able-bodied perspective. A product of late 60s radicalism, the camp was a melting pot of liberation: formative conversations on not being heard and finding your voice, baseball games and folk singalongs, furtive makeouts in dark corners.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs0VRfOg7Wo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Fs0VRfOg7Wo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>LeBrecht had always sensed that Jened played an outsize role in the disability rights movement of the late 70s and 80s, \u201cand that\u2019s the one that we traced because we really wanted to bring people into this history, this group of friends, this almost Breakfast Club-like feeling of watching a group of people come together across difference and recognize their commonalities and see the power in that\u201d, said Newnham. \u201cWe chose to look at what was the rippling out of this particular place, and how does that play a role in the movement that came later.\u201d</p> <p>In the beginning, that ripple effect was just \u201ca theory for us\u201d, said Newnham. First, they had to find evidence. The two began outreach from a Facebook page LeBrecht sent Newnham on which Jened alums had posted photos and memories for years. And the film-makers called up Judy Heumann, a polio survivor and disability rights crusader who served as special adviser for international disability rights at the US Department of State under Barack Obama and worked as a counselor at Jened in her early 20s. She, too, remembered Jened\u2019s powerful role in shaping her and her friends\u2019 politics and purpose. \u201c\u2018This camp is where we had those conversations in the bunks late at night that made us realize, hey, there\u2019s this civil rights movement going on around us, why aren\u2019t we a part of it?\u2019\u201d Newnham recalled her saying. \u201cOr, \u2018Hey, you know, this is actually oppression that we\u2019re all experiencing,\u2019 because it wasn\u2019t just one person\u2019s burden or story any more, it was a community story.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62bfa87a5b48075bf442098ca4b0875e2f168b2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62bfa87a5b48075bf442098ca4b0875e2f168b2a/0_0_6300_4200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jim LeBrecht, Nicole Newnham and Judy Heumann at Sundance 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jim LeBrecht, Nicole Newnham and Judy Heumann at Sundance 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Sykes/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the real breakthrough came when LeBrecht remembered a \u201cradical, early video coalition of hippies\u201d who stopped by the camp in the summer of 1971, strapped a camera to his wheelchair, and directed him to film. LeBrecht and Newnham tracked down Howard Gutstadt of the People\u2019s Video Theater, an experimental film-making group from the 70s who embedded in New York\u2019s first women\u2019s liberation march, the first gay pride march and a day in the life of Camp Jened. Gutstadt, who happened to live a few miles away in Berkeley, was in the process of digitizing the group\u2019s five and a half hours of footage from the camp, which now composes most of Crip Camp\u2019s first third.</p> <p>The incredible footage captures the camp\u2019s network of interdependence and freedom \u2013 a coalition of able-bodied and disabled people swimming together, or organizing dishes and chores; a 15-year-old LeBrecht laments his separation from his first girlfriend on their one-week anniversary, because of a crabs outbreak in the camp. One extraordinary scene confirms Heumann\u2019s memories of formative discussions: campers sit around a table discussing overprotective parents, their frustrations and their ambitions.</p> <p>Watching the footage, LeBrecht said, it\u2019s \u201cimpossible to kind of find the right words for it \u2013 it\u2019s very bittersweet and exciting, and it literally was like finding home movies that I didn\u2019t know existed.\u201d As an outsider, said Newnham, \u201cI can\u2019t even overemphasize how the camp itself is seen as almost kinda like a spiritual place for the people who went there.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa859b1c9e024cef2a357db423552bdd4e557e25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa859b1c9e024cef2a357db423552bdd4e557e25/0_0_2179_2146/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A photograph from Crip Camp\" width=\"1000\" height=\"985\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A photograph from Crip Camp.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patti Smolian/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Part of Jened\u2019s power, according to LeBrecht, was meeting Heumann, who by then had already<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/27/archives/woman-in-wheel-chair-sues-to-become-teacher.html\"> sued the New York City </a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/27/archives/woman-in-wheel-chair-sues-to-become-teacher.html\">board of </a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/27/archives/woman-in-wheel-chair-sues-to-become-teacher.html\">education</a> for the right to work as a teacher. \u201cFor me, as a 15-year-old feeling like the world is there, but why can\u2019t I get on a train? Why can\u2019t I do this? \u2013 to meet somebody who actually sued and prevailed to get her teaching position in the New York City board of education felt like a huge, mind-opening thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m like, you can fight back? People will listen to us? We have some rights here?\u201d</p> <p>LeBrecht, like many campers from Jened and Heumann herself, carried this sense of purpose forward. The rest of the film finds familiar Jened faces in the fight to secure basic rights for disabled people in the United States: the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/17/archives/disabled-in-san-francisco-vow-to-continue-sitin.html\">28-day sit-in</a> at the office of health, education, and welfare in San Francisco in 1977 \u2013 the longest non-violent occupation of a federal building \u2013 to demand enforcement of the law which required all new construction paid for with federal dollars to be handicap accessible; a shutdown of Madison Avenue and marches on Washington under-covered then and now, demanding visibility for disabled Americans and the right to participate fully in American society.</p> <p>The project has taken five years, with ample research help and archival assistance from academics on civil rights, to create what the film-makers hope will be a greater public understanding of the disability rights movement. \u201cOur goal was that we could help reframe how people think about disabilities and people with disabilities,\u201d said LeBrecht. \u201cIf we could get people to see beyond the old tropes seen on television and movies and really see us for who we are, then it would go a long way toward improving lives for everyone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFrom the beginning, we\u2019ve known that this was an overlooked and incredibly powerful story out of civil rights history and we wanted it to get its due,\u201d said Newnham. \u201cAnd we wanted people to take power from this story of a small group of people, individuals coming together to create change and make the world a better place.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Crip Camp is now available on Netflix</p></li> </ul>",

We\u2019re still having thousands of people coming in on planes every single day.</p> <p>\u201cAll authorities have to step up, including NSW Health, including all the other authorities involved.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is really imperative at this time, we realised, is strong communication between authorities and everybody stepping up.\u201d</p> <p>The state\u2019s chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said New Zealand had checked the ship in Wellington and found no cases of Covid-19. But once NSW authorities had recognised that coronavirus was on the ship they had followed up on all of the passengers.</p> <p>She said there was \u201cno action that NSW Health could have taken to prevent those people acquiring the disease\u201d, as they had acquired it on the ship.</p> <p>She stressed that all passengers had been asked to self-isolate and that any cases identified were being \u201cringfenced\u201d.</p> <p>Most people began showing symptoms on the day of disembarkation and in subsequent days, she said, and NSW Health were working incredibly hard to limit onward transmission.</p> <p>\u201cIf we had had any suspicion, we would have deployed health teams,\u201d Chant said.</p> <p>The department had contingency plans in place if an outbreak were identified.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, with hindsight, we would have acted differently, had we known we had a Covid-positive cruise ship.\u201d</p> <p>Chant said she would look into reports that passengers were not given instructions to self-isolate when they disembarked, noting that this was an ABF responsibility as its officers processed passengers.</p> <p>She defended allowing overseas passengers to fly home, as this was part of the agreed protocol to send them into self-isolation at home. Tracing of people sitting in rows around infected passengers was being conducted, she said.</p> <p>A week earlier Scott Morrison announced a 30-day ban on foreign cruise ships docking in Australia but the government made an exemption for <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-21/coronavirus-four-cruise-ships-dock-australia-national-ban/12077824\">four </a><a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-21/coronavirus-four-cruise-ships-dock-australia-national-ban/12077824\">already on their way</a>, including the Ruby Princess.</p> <p>Three of these ships have subsequently been found to be carrying people infected with Covid-19.

However, in accordance with the Australian government guidance, all passengers must go into self-isolation for 14 days,\u2019\u201d Outram said.</p> <p>He went on to say that on 18 March the Department of Agriculture was informed through Ruby Princess that a risk assessment had been conducted and that the ship was considered \u201clow risk\u201d. This is consistent with NSW Health\u2019s version of events.</p> <p>\u201cNSW Health decided not to board the vessel and attend, and that they had also given clearance for all passengers to disembark the vessel,\u201d Outram said. \u201cThat red light has just gone green. So, the vessel came into port on March 19. </p> <p>\u201cThey felt the vessel was low risk and there was no need to attend the vessel, but our six officers wore masks and gloves nonetheless.\u201d</p> <p>He said protocols required any vessel coming into Australia\u2019s waters from overseas to provide 96 hours\u2019 notice for any disease. He said this had worked well for ships docking in Victoria and Western Australia, which had sent state health authorities to board them.</p> <p>Labor\u2019s spokeswoman on immigration, Kristina Keneally, said the Ruby Princess fiasco would prove to be a tipping point in Covid-19\u2019s spread in Australia.</p> <p>\u201cWe have now 133 passengers and counting from the Ruby Princess cruise ship that have tested positive for coronavirus,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Ruby Princess cruise ship coronavirus cases account for 10% of the cases in NSW. And, quite tragically, there has already been one death.\u201d</p> <p>This was despite the prime minister announcing there would be no more cruise ships arriving in Australia, she said.</p> <p>\u201cThey went into taxis and public transport, they interacted with friends and neighbours, they went to shops, they were allowed to travel across the country,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is gobsmacking that we are in this circumstance today. We need to ask, we need to demand to know how this happened and we need to ensure it does not happen again. The Australian government needs to get on top of this situation very quickly.\u201d</p>",

Parks in scenic Marin county, north of San Francisco, were closed and access was restricted to many of the trails in the Santa Monica Mountains that run through Los Angeles county.</p> \n<p>As Donald Trump voiced his desire to get Americans<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/trump-coronavirus-us-easter-new-york-fauci-birx\"> back to normality by Easter</a>, Newsom had a more sober outlook on the shutdown situation in California on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to bend that curve but we haven\u2019t bent it,\u201d he said. \u201cEarly April, that would be misleading to represent, at least for California.\u201d</p> \n<p>If the state continues to follow the current protocols for the next six to eight, or even the next eight to 12 weeks, \u201cwe\u2019ll be in a very different place than we are today\u201d, he said. \u201cBut I think April for California will be sooner than any of the experts that I talk to would believe is possible.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Vivian Ho and agencies contributed reporting</em></p>",

She says that she is quarantined out of \u201chonour and respect for Covid-19\u201d, which is a spicy way to put it.</p> <p>Subsequent videos involve her singing a version of her hit Vogue that is about eating fried fish, and sitting in a bathtub full of flower petals discussing how Covid-19 doesn\u2019t care about \u201chow rich you are\u201d.

When I returned from my trip around Central Europe I isolated myself (in a borrowed apartment away from my mother and sister) since the number of cases of COVID-19 (in Germany for instance) were similar to Italy in the beginning. Around ten days ago I started feeling some symptoms, exactly the same time as my father - who traveled with me from Brussels. I was feeling tired, had shivers, a sore throat and coughed. My dad experienced the same symptoms, but much more intense and with a fever. In Sweden you can not test yourself for COVID-19 unless you\u2019re in need of emergent medical treatment. Everyone feeling ill are told to stay at home and isolate themselves. I have therefore not been tested for COVID-19, but it\u2019s extremely likely that I\u2019ve had it, given the combined symptoms and circumstances. Now I\u2019ve basically recovered, but - AND THIS IS THE BOTTOM LINE: I almost didn\u2019t feel ill. My last cold was much worse than this! Had it not been for someone else having the virus simultainously I might not even have suspected anything. Then I would just have thought I was feeling unusually tired with a bit of a cough. And this it what makes it so much more dangerous. Many (especially young people) might not notice any symptoms at all, or very mild symptoms. Then they don\u2019t know they have the virus and can pass it on to people in risk groups.

Carnival Corp\u2019s Ruby Princess, became the country\u2019s largest source of coronavirus infections as one of its passengers also became the eighth fatality nationally. <br><br>In a chain of events described by New South Wales state Police Minister David Elliott as a \u201cmonumental stuff-up\u201d, about 2,700 passengers were allowed to leave the ship when it docked in Sydney on 19 March. <br><br>By Tuesday, around 130 of those passengers had tested positive and officials were frantically hunting down other travellers to test them and track their movements. <br><br>Australia stepped closer to a full lockdown on Tuesday, with authorities warning of harsher penalties for anybody violating self-isolation orders as they began to worry that hospitals were starting to feel the strain. <br><br>With 1,984 cases, Australia has registered significantly lower rates of coronavirus compared to elsewhere in the world, but the infection rate has quickened in recent days and NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said it was now at a \u201ccritical stage.\u201d <br><br>While schools officially remained open in most of the country, parents were strongly advised to keep their children home, as all other non-essential services, including cinemas, pubs and houses of worship, were closed for the first full day. <br><br>Authorities had initially classified the ship as low risk because it was returning from an 11-day round trip to New Zealand, despite around a dozen passengers showing signs of ill health. About 60% of the passengers were Australian, and 20% were from the United States, ship records showed. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e79906f8f08cc9a819472bd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/lois-beckett\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-24T04:47:03.520Z\">4.47am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As Donald Trump pushed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/trump-vows-to-open-up-our-country-even-as-deaths-from-coronavirus-rise\">re-open the US economy in weeks</a>, rather than months, the lieutenant governor of Texas went on Fox News to argue that he would rather die than see public health measures damage the US economy, and that he believed \u201clots of grandparents\u201d across the country would agree with him.</p> \n  <p>\u201cMy message: let\u2019s get back to work, let\u2019s get back to living, let\u2019s be smart about it, and those of us who are 70-plus, we\u2019ll take care of ourselves,\u201d Lt Gov Dan Patrick, a 69-year-old Republican, told Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Monday night.</p> \n  <p>\u201cDon\u2019t sacrifice the country,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Patrick said he feared that public health restrictions to prevent coronavirus could end American life as he knows it, and that he is willing to risk death to protect the economy for his grandchildren.</p> \n  <p>\u201cYou know, Tucker, no one reached out to me and said, <strong>\u2018As a senior citizen, are you willing to take a chance on your survival in exchange for keeping the America that all America loves for your children and grandchildren?\u2019</strong>\u201d Patrick said. \u201cAnd if that\u2019s the exchange, I\u2019m all in.\u201d</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ndrew_lawrence/status/1242245135129346050\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Tx Lt Gov Dan Patrick says grandparents would be willing to die to save the economy for their grandchildren <a href=\"https://t.co/wC3Ngvtsbj\">pic.twitter.com/wC3Ngvtsbj</a></p>\u2014 Andrew Lawrence (@ndrew_lawrence) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ndrew_lawrence/status/1242245135129346050?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 24, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/older-people-would-rather-die-than-let-covid-19-lockdown-harm-us-economy-texas-official-dan-patrick\">Older people would rather die than let Covid-19 harm US economy \u2013 Texas official</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e798e898f08e46329cb4a9f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-24T04:41:02.541Z\">4.41am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Asian stocks rallied on Tuesday as the US Federal Reserve\u2019s promise of bottomless dollar funding eased painful strains in financial markets, even if it could not soften the immediate economic hit of the coronavirus. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d3b169bebeb674cf99e8a1df70d46358bebb774\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d3b169bebeb674cf99e8a1df70d46358bebb774/0_0_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man with a protective mask in the rain looks at an electronic stock board showing Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index at a securities firm in Tokyo Monday, 23 March 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man with a protective mask in the rain looks at an electronic stock board showing Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index at a securities firm in Tokyo Monday, 23 March 2020.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eugene Hoshiko/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>While Wall Street seemed unimpressed, investors in Asia were encouraged enough to lift E-Mini futures for the S&amp;P 500 by 2.7% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 4.7%.

And you have suicides over things like this when you have terrible economies. You have death, probably, I mean definitely would be in greater numbers than the numbers that we\u2019re talking about with regard to the virus.\u201d</p> \n  <p>What does the data show?</p> \n  <p>It is reasonable to suggest that a pandemic-linked recession <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/03/23/coronavirus-pandemic-isolation-fear-job-loss-triggers-suicide/2871949001/\">can increase the risk of a rise in suicides</a>. </p> \n  <p>According to research published in the <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry\">British Journal of Psychiatry</a>, North America and Europe experienced 10,000 more suicides during the 2008 recession. The outbreak of Sars in Hong Kong in 2002 and 2003 also led to a \u201csignificant increase\u201d in suicides in those aged over 65, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20418214\">according to 2010 research</a>.</p> \n  <p>But experts also caution that there is no single cause of suicide.</p> \n  <p>While the figures for the mortality rate of coronavirus continues to evolve, recent research from Wuhan, China, the city where the outbreak began, indicates the mortality rate there <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/health/wuhan-coronavirus-deaths.html\">was around 1.4%</a>. Experts <a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/03/hundreds-of-u-s-coronavirus-cases-may-have-slipped-through-screenings/\">at Harvard University</a> have projected an infection rate in the US of between 20 - 60%, meaning that while it is impossible to reliably estimate the American coronavirus death toll <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/16/upshot/coronavirus-best-worst-death-toll-scenario.html\">a reasonable scenario</a> could result in hundreds of thousands of lives lost.</p> \n  <p>On first look, given the potentially devastating death toll directly associated with coronavirus, it appears unlikely to be matched by an increased rate in suicide, making the presidents claim almost certainly inaccurate. </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><em>In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.

They\u2019re amazing people and the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way, shape or form.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>The White House Correspondents Association said one of its members is suspected of having Covid-19,</strong> something that could put Donald Trump\u2019s daily press briefings at risk - or at least raise the possibility of them being done remotely.</li> \n   <li><strong>Antonio Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, has appealed for an immediate global ceasefire,</strong> calling on an end to all armed conflicts so that the world can instead focus on fighting Coronavirus.</li> \n   <li><strong> </strong><strong>Japan\u2019s government is negotiating with the International Olympic Committee to postpone the Tokyo Olympic Game</strong><strong>s</strong> by a maximum one year, the Sankei newspaper reported on Tuesday.</li> \n   <li><strong>Global recoveries passed 100,000 but the pandemic \u2018is accelerating\u2019. </strong>The World Heath Organization said it had taken 67 days from the first reported case to reach the first 100,000 cases, 11 days for the second 100,000 cases, and only four for the third 100,000 cases.</li> \n   <li><strong>UK deaths reach 335 and Britons abroad told to come home. </strong>The Foreign Office urged as many as a million Britons on holiday or business trips abroad to return to the UK immediately.</li> \n   <li><strong> </strong><strong>Italy registered a smaller day-to-day increase in new coronavirus cases for the second day. </strong>The death toll from the outbreak grew by 602 to 6,078, the head of the Civil Protection Agency said. While that is an 11% increase, it is the smallest nominal rise since last Thursday.</li> \n   <li><strong>The first UK clinical trial enrolled patients.</strong> Researchers from the University of Oxford launched a clinical trial to test the effects of potential drug treatments for patients admitted to hospital with the virus. There are currently no specific treatments for the coronavirus, but it is possible that existing drugs used for other conditions may have some benefits.</li> \n   <li><strong>New York state confirmed 20,000 infections.</strong> The governor, Andrew Cuomo, said the state had 5,707 new cases, meaning it has confirmed 20,875 in total.</li> \n   <li><strong>Panama confirmed the death one of the youngest victims of the virus,</strong> a 13-year-old girl. Medical experts have been trying to drum home the warning that, while older people and those with underlying conditions are at greater risk, they are not the only ones who need to take precautionary measures.</li> \n   <li><strong>Denmark extended its lockdown.</strong> The nationwide restrictions will now last until 13 April.</li> \n   <li><strong>Russia may be forced to put off a public vote on amendments allowing Vladimir Putin to hold office until 2036.</strong> The Kremlin has not rescheduled the 22 April vote, but the prospect was explicitly acknowledged by Putin\u2019s spokesman.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-24T01:28:17.714Z\">at 1.28am GMT</time></p> \n</div>",
  "<p>As New Zealand enters its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/kiwis-go-home-new-zealand-to-go-into-month-long-lockdown-to-fight-coronavirus\">coronavirus-induced lockdown</a>, the prime minister keeps telling us we are all in this together. But whatever it is that we are in \u2013 this crisis, this immense disruption, this pain \u2013 some of us are much deeper in it than others. We will not all be equally affected. Some lives could be forever damaged; others will emerge relatively unscathed.</p> <p>This crisis is shot through with inequality: it is revealing existing imbalances, and risks creating new ones. Every part of the government\u2019s response must acknowledge that this is an inequality crisis. Some people will require especially urgent aid, while others may in the long run have to contribute more to the recovery.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/new-zealand-coronavirus-cases-rise-50-in-one-day-as-lockdown-nears\">New Zealand: coronavirus cases rise nearly 50% in one day as lockdown nears</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Consider the lessons of the last similar event, the global financial crisis. Even though our government did not fully embrace austerity, the ranks of the poor still swelled by tens of thousands. It took six years for the incomes of the poorest New Zealanders to recover, while those of the richest rebounded almost instantly.</p> <p>We cannot afford a repeat. So let\u2019s start by doing more to help the most vulnerable of all: the homeless. The New Zealand Council of Christian Social Services (NZCCSS), the body representing church welfare agencies, says those sleeping rough, couch-surfing and living in overcrowded accommodation will struggle to self-isolate.</p> <p>At the same time, the country must now have hundreds of empty motel and hotel rooms. So can the government not find a way to bring the two together, as is <a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/120440789/wellington-hotels-offer-rooms-to-renters-as-housing-crisis-social-distancing-continues\">already happening</a> for renters?</p> <p>Vulnerable people, the church agencies point out, also have \u201ca tenuous connection with the internet and with cell phone connectivity\u201d. Very often they don\u2019t have home broadband and can\u2019t afford to top-up their phone.</p> <p>So, at a minimum, we should ensure that all the social services they need to call have toll-free 0800 numbers, and that all essential government websites can be accessed without using data. And if schooling is going to be delivered online for an extended period, we\u2019ll need a permanent \u2013 and rapid \u2013 way to bring free internet access to communities where it is not yet standard.</p> <p>We must also remember that certain groups, notably M\u0101ori and Pasifika, are particularly likely to be in poverty. Many Pasifika families live in overcrowded homes, heightening the risk of disease transmission, and may need extra support. Meanwhile, Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, the chief executive of Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101ti Ruanui, the governing body of one of the Taranaki iwi, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/packer_deb/status/1241197239084527616\">has argued</a> that health inequalities mean older M\u0101ori are vulnerable at 60, not 70. Everything looks different through an inequality lens.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/gangs-of-new-zealand-explosion-of-violence-prompts-fears-police-have-lost-control\">Gangs of New Zealand: explosion of violence prompts fears police have lost control</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although the government\u2019s response so far has been compassionate, it still pales into comparison with action taken overseas. A $25-a-week permanent benefit increase was welcome, but Australia has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/australian-jobseekers-to-get-550-increase-as-part-of-huge-coronavirus-welfare-package\">just doubled</a> its core benefit, albeit temporarily, boosting it by $225 a week. Here, we should also consider <a href=\"https://thespinoff.co.nz/politics/24-03-2020/the-case-for-a-huge-covid-19-benefit-reform/#.Xnk_69_LK5o.twitter\">making child-related payments easier to access</a> and stop penalising low-income people in relationships who are supporting each other financially. Even business leaders <a href=\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/morningreport/audio/2018740060/coronavirus-business-nz-praises-government-financial-scheme\">have indicated</a> they would not oppose further increases to benefits.</p> <p>The newly announced provisions to protect jobs also need tightening. The Council of Trade Unions<a href=\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/morningreport/audio/2018740044/coronavirus-finance-minister-on-employers-forcing-workers-to-take-sick-pay-annual-leave\"> said</a> some businesses were taking wage subsidies but still forcing staff to take sick leave or annual leave, in breach of the law. It is <a href=\"https://www.metromag.co.nz/society/society-politics/coronavirus-covid-19-support-package-government-putting-too-much-trust-in-business-owners-to-do-the-right-thing\">also unclear</a> what will stop unscrupulous employers taking the subsidies and then simply sacking people. What are the \u201cbest endeavours\u201d to keep people on, and how will they be enforced?</p> <p>More generally, any further support to business has to pass a simple inequality test: will it ultimately help those who need it most?</p> <p>Renters, meanwhile, are feeling aggrieved after getting less help, so far, than mortgage-holders. The \u201choliday\u201d for the latter may only delay, rather than reduce, the mortgage payments they have to make. But no such similar ability to defer rent payments has been offered. And while the government has stopped \u201cno-fault\u201d evictions, it should follow the lead of <a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/2020/03/16/growing-number-of-cities-states-halting-evictions-because-of-coronavirus/\">many American cities</a> and ban evictions outright during the lockdown. While evictions may be unlikely at this time, no-one should have even the threat of them hanging over their head.</p> <p>At the other end of the spectrum, some people will escape the crisis unscathed, or even prosper. Supermarket shareholders and owners will be raking it in. Some workers, including those in the public sector, effectively have their incomes protected. Others can eat a little into large reserves of capital to ride out the crisis. That, after all, is one of the main reasons people amass wealth.</p> <p>So we cannot take a broad brush or scattergun approach to supporting people through the crisis. If we try to help everyone equally, the money will be so thinly spread that it will make little difference to those who need it most.</p> <p>The government must also be aware of the risk of exacerbating inequality. It has begun a version of quantitative easing, in which the Reserve Bank buys up government bonds as a way to encourage lending. This may, unfortunately, be needed, but one of the main effects of quantitative easing is to <a href=\"https://www.ineteconomics.org/uploads/papers/WP28-Epstein-Montecino.pdf\">drive up the prices of financial assets</a> held largely by the rich. So we must keep this kind of action to a minimum, favouring instead policies that get money into the hands of ordinary people.</p> <p>In the long run, we will need to think about who finances the post-crisis recovery. The government\u2019s books are taking a hammering, and once we are out the other side of this crisis, most people will be in no position to help repair the resulting holes.</p> <p>Although now is not the time for detailed discussions, those who come through coronavirus relatively untouched, those whose wealth is largely intact, will have to put their hands deeper into their pockets. Only when that happens will it be true to say that we are all in this together.</p>",

Georgia was originally scheduled to hold its primary on Tuesday, but delayed it until May 19. There is an aggressive push to get Congress to require states to offer voters a chance to vote by mail in the November presidential election.</p> \n  <p>Georgia does not require an excuse to vote by mail, but just 7% of voters took advantage of the process during the state\u2019s closely watched 2018 gubernatorial election, the Atlanta Journal- Constitution reported. The state will also offer in-person voting on election day.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI am acting today because the people of Georgia, from the earliest settlers to heroes like Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Congressman John Lewis, have fought too long and too hard for their right to vote to have it curtailed,\u201d Raffensperger said in a statement. \u201cGeorgia has faced challenges before and overcome them, and we can do so again through the grit and ingenuity that has made America a shining example for democracies around the world.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Sending registered voters an absentee ballot request form could also refocus attention on the way Georgia removes people from the voter rolls. In December, the state removed around <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/legislators-asked-change-georgia-purge-law-after-court-upheld/C2cxuC65N9umd2Wg8bKO7J/\">100,000 people</a> who hadn\u2019t voted since the 2012 election and didn\u2019t respond to mailings from the state asking them to confirm their address.

It\u2019s just Ardern speaking. Australia has got all the states making decisions and the federal government.\u201d</p> \n<p>Criticism and debate are the lifeblood of democracy, but there seems little point in point-scoring politics. The New Zealand government, too, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/covid-19-new-zealand-government-accused-of-flat-footed-response\">was criticised for responding slowly at the start</a> \u2013 \u201cKiwi complacency\u201d it was called \u2013 and for doing too little testing.</p> \n<p>But Ardern\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/kiwis-go-home-new-zealand-to-go-into-month-long-lockdown-to-fight-coronavirus\">address to the nation on Monday</a> announcing a four-week shutdown of New Zealand from Wednesday \u2013 \u201cKiwis, go home,\u201d she said \u2013 was clear and unequivocal. The four-stage alert system in New Zealand \u2013 rising to level three immediately and level four by Wednesday, is simple to understand.</p> \n<p>Level four means people are instructed to stay home, schools and universities are shut, all non-essential businesses close, air travel and public transport are only to be used to transport essential workers and freight. There will be no weddings, parties, gatherings of any sort. Essential services such as supermarkets, GPs and pharmacies will remain open.</p> \n<p>It was Ardern\u2019s tone at the lectern that mattered as much as the substance. She acknowledged these were the \u201cmost significant restrictions on movement in modern history\u201d. But without them, \u201ctens of thousands of New Zealanders will die. There is no easy way to say that.\u201d She ended as she often does: \u201cBe strong and be kind.\u201d</p> \n<p>If Ardern\u2019s credibility as leader was strengthened by her response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/christchurch-shooting\">Christchurch terrorist attack</a> last year, the credibility of Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, was weakened by initial errors in the response to the unprecedented scale of the summer bushfires.</p> \n<p>People value transparency, and most will forgive missteps in such a fast-moving and unprecedented crisis, but the contradictory messages in the early days of the coronavirus did confuse. (Morrison\u2019s statement on 13 March that he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2020/mar/13/scott-morrison-defends-decision-to-attend-rugby-league-game-during-coronavirus-outbreak-video\">still go to a rugby league game</a> after announcing that all gatherings of more than 500 should be cancelled after the weekend, was the most obvious, although he subsequently decided not to go.)</p> \n<p>Morrison did establish a national cabinet, including all state and territory leaders, the first in Australian history, and has announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/22/what-australias-189bn-coronavirus-economic-rescue-package-means-for-you\">significant support for business, workers and those thrown out of work</a> \u2013 all up, $189bn worth, almost 10% of GDP.

When people are told that it is too dangerous to go to a cafe, but they are fine to get a haircut, they are right to be confused.\u201d</p> \n<p>Bill Bowtell, who led Australia\u2019s response to the HIV/Aids crisis in the 1990s and has slammed government responses as far as too slow, uncoordinated and timid, tweeted: \u201cThe federation is useless in this crisis.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/ardern-has-shone-in-the-coronavirus-crisis-but-a-recession-could-still-doom-her-re-election-chances\">Ardern has shone in the coronavirus crisis but a recession could still doom her re-election chances</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>One of the issues is that the expert advice in Australia is different to that of New Zealand and many other countries. To date, it is advocating strong measures, but not an enforced shutdown of all but essential services. In its <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/news/australian-health-protection-principal-committee-ahppc-coronavirus-covid-19-statement-on-22-march-2020\">latest advice on Wednesday</a>, the Australian Health Protection Principals Committee said that while it was advising stronger measures such as those announced on Tuesday - real estate auctions, wellness centres, community groups to stop operating - it was still taking a step by step approach. It was \u201ctoo early to assess the impact of current social distancing measures,\u201d it said, and that \u201cmaterially more disruptive measures should ideally be held in reserve\u201d. That could include a \u201ccarefully considered closure of all activity\u201d except for essential industries and services.</p> \n<p>Morrison on Tuesday night announced even stricter measures, but not an enforced lockdown similar to New Zealand. The committee does not support school closures right now given the lack of evidence of significant disease in children and the lack of reported major disease spreading in school. It said that school closures may be \u201cmore effective when approaching the peak of the epidemic and enforced for a shorter period\u201d. On Monday, it did not support a more comprehensive shutdown \u201cat this time\u201d.</p> \n<p>Social researcher Dr Rebecca Huntley said she doesn\u2019t want to criticise the government, but past research shows that people look for \u201chard and fast\u201d rules in times of crisis.</p> \n<p>\u201cAustralia was too slow in the early days of the crisis about the need for behaviour change. The messages around hygiene and social distances should have been \u2018carpet-bombed\u2019 even before we had significant cases,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat people need are hard and fast rules. When you give people discretion, at a time of panic, then that\u2019s very difficult for them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Research into peoples\u2019 responses to the global financial crisis found that most people did understand the notion of sacrifice for the broader group and had a sense of \u201ccivic pride\u201d in contributing. In such a huge and confusing crisis as this, politicians had to shift their normal instincts, she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cFundamentally, you have to find a way to channel your inner human being rather than your inner politician. Politicians are very good at constructing words that they feel won\u2019t come back to bite them and words that aren\u2019t so definitive. This is not the moment for that.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the UK, the government was criticised for wasting weeks on a \u201cherd immunity\u201d strategy, which meant a more passive approach to the virus, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/new-data-new-policy-why-uks-coronavirus-strategy-has-changed\">then pivoted hard</a> when a study was released on 17 March showing the death toll of such a strategy \u2013 260,000 \u2013would be catastrophic.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/24/australia-is-crying-out-for-clearer-messaging-on-coronavirus-rambling-politicians-told\">Australia is crying out for clearer messaging on coronavirus, 'rambling' politicians told</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The change in direction was confusing and hardly engendered trust, but the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, is now in lockstep with New Zealand and many European countries.</p> \n<p>The US president, Donald Trump, has variously underplayed the threat, ramped it up, and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/trump-coronavirus-us-easter-new-york-fauci-birx\"> now questioned the wisdom of draconian measures.</a></p> \n<p>\u201cOur country wasn\u2019t built to be shut down,\u201d he told a briefing. \u201cIf it were up to the doctors, they\u2019d say let\u2019s shut down the entire world. This could create a much bigger problem than the problem that you started out with.\u201d</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the states are going it alone, moving to stay-at-home orders, covering 158 million Americans in 16 states.</p> \n<p>In New Zealand, there is no downplaying the seriousness of the response, and what it will mean. As well as lining up for food and alcohol before the lockdown comes into effect, a local newspaper reported that there was <a href=\"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12319308\">a long queue outside an Auckland gun shop</a>.</p> \n<p>But many people appear to agree with Ardern\u2019s decisions, and trust her to make them. Samuel Clack is a 27-year-old PhD student at the Victoria University of Wellington, and a trainee psychologist. Lockdown is \u201cscary\u201d, he says, but he\u2019s glad of it.
