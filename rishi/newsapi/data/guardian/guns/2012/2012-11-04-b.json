  "<p>David Cameron has acknowledged in private that he may be sitting on a further cache of emails and texts to and from Rebekah Brooks after a limited search was carried out for the Leveson inquiry.</p> <p>The prime minister faced fresh embarrassment over his links with the former News International chief executive as it became clear only a handful of his communications were searched for the inquiry, set up after the phone-hacking scandal.</p> <p>Cameron and his aides looked for emails and texts with News International or News Corporation employees only if there was a reference to the BSkyB bid. He checked his personal and office phone.</p> <p>The prime minister believes it is wrong of critics, such as the former Labour Europe minister Chris Bryant, to say he is hiding a secret cache of communications because the search requested by the Leveson inquiry yielded no texts or emails. A No 10 source said: \"Chris Bryant has made a series of claims that are ridiculous.\"</p> <p>But Cameron knows a wider search could uncover more texts and emails. In his written statement to the Leveson enquiry, the prime minister made clear the limited nature of the request for texts.</p> <p>\"In terms of electronic communications, as requested, I have looked for text messages between myself and representatives of News Corporation or News International in relation to the BSkyB bid,\" Cameron said. \"I have not found any such texts on my personal phone or office phone.\"</p> <p>He faced further discomfort when the Mail on Sunday published a text from Brooks in which she admitted she had cried twice during his party conference speech. She wrote: \"Brilliant speech. I cried twice. Will love 'working together'.\"</p> <p>The paper also published a more innocuous text sent by the prime minister to Brooks about a horse he rode in company with her husband Charlie, one of Cameron's oldest friends. \"The horse CB [Charlie Brooks] put me on. Fast, unpredictable and hard to control but fun. DC.\"</p> <p>The texts were handed to the Leveson inquiry by Brooks, as were those published by the inquiry in the summer. These revealed Cameron signed some of his texts to Brooks LOL, which she claimed meant \"Laugh out loud\", not \"Lots of Love\".</p> <p>Bryant tweeted of the new revelations: \"These new texts are the tip of an iceberg.\" The Mail on Sunday reported that Bryant had claimed to be in contact with a No 10 mole involved in search who is said to have described the texts as \"salacious\".</p> <p>Bryant told Cameron in the Commons on Wednesday: \"There is a stash of embarrassing emails, isn't there? [Former special adviser] Adam Smith had to publish every single one of his emails and ended up resigning. Why will the prime minister not publish all his emails?\"</p> <p>Cameron declined to respond to Bryant's point as he is awaiting an apology from him after he broke an embargo to leak information from the inquiry.</p> <p>David Willetts, the universities minister, admitted the relationship between politicians and some newspapers became too close. He told the Sunday Politics show on BBC1: \"The prime minister has always complied with every request for relevant information from Leveson.</p> <p>\"Now, of course, we wait and see what Lord [Justice] Leveson proposes.\"</p>",
  "<p>Florida Democrats have accused the swing state's Republican leadership of impinging on the fundamental rights of Americans amid growing voter anger at lengthy queues to vote, the shutting down of early voting and chaos in Miami over absentee ballots.</p> <p>The state's Democratic party filed a lawsuit on Sunday to keep polling places open until election day as the Republicans stood accused of attempting to disenfranchise its opponents with new limits on early voting that contributed to waits of more than seven hours to cast ballots in Democratic strongholds such as Miami.</p> <p>The Miami-Dade elections headquarters shut it doors on Sunday to people attempting to request absentee ballots because so many people showed up. Outside, would-be voters protested, shouting: \"Let us vote\".</p> <p>Myrna Peralta, who waited with her four-year-old grandson for nearly two hours before being turned away, told the Miami Herald: \"This is America, not a third-world country \u2026 They're not letting people vote.\"</p> <p>After the outcry spread over social media, the department opened its doors again later in the afternoon. But the incident reflected deepening frustration at what are widely seen as Republican attempts to manipulate the election.</p> <p>Long queues over the past week for early voting reflected a record turnout to vote early in Florida, with about 4 million people casting their ballots in advance of election day proper on Tuesday, as well as the longest ballot paper in the state's history, including complicated constitutional amendments.</p> <p>But Democrats said they were also caused by Republican legislation sharply cutting the number of days for early voting from 14 to eight. That included scrapping voting on the final Sunday before election day, when large numbers of African Americans traditionally went to the polls after church.</p> <p>The Florida Democratic party filed a legal action in Miami to try to keep at least some polling stations open for early voting in three key counties \u2013 Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach \u2013 which account for about one-third of the party's support in the state.</p> <p>The lawsuit said \"inadequate polling facilities\" contributed to long waits in all three places. The last voters in Miami cast their ballots at 1am on Sunday even though the polling place official closed at 7pm on Saturday.</p> <p>\"The extraordinarily long lines deterred or prevented voters from waiting to vote. Some voters left the polling sites upon learning of the expected wait, and others refused to line up altogether,\" the legal action said. \"These long lines and extreme delays unduly and unjustifiably burdened the right to vote.\"</p> <p>The state's Republican governor, Rick Scott, who has the power to extend early voting days, declined to do so.</p> <p>Rod Smith, the chairman of the Florida Democratic party, accused Republicans of impinging on people's rights.</p> <p>\"Voting is a fundamental right, and we all have an interest in assuring that all Americans have effective opportunities to vote,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Florida's Republican state legislature has already reduced the number of days to early vote by six days. Because of Governor Scott's refusal to follow precedent and extend early voting hours in the face of unprecedented voter turnout in south Florida, we are requesting in federal court that more Floridians have a meaningful chance to early vote.\"</p> <p>Separately, a judge ordered an extension to early voting at an Orange County polling station after it was shut by a bomb scare on Saturday.</p> <p>The US justice department has one eye on the 2000 election debacle of hanging chads and discounted votes, as well as more recent Florida election legislation struck down in federal court as discriminating against minorities, so it is monitoring the conduct of the vote in Florida to determine if the long queues are a deliberate obstacle to voting and therefore in breach of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.</p>",

I was in Atlanta, Georgia that day and I remember the line snaking right round the school where the polling station was set up; on and on it went. This year I truly didn't expect to see anything nearly as impressive, what with the mood of the country being so sour and the economy still so sluggish. But I've just seen one of the longest lines I've ever seen at the polling station in downtown Cleveland. It was so long it went round the block and around another block. I walked all the way along it and counted my steps \u2013 400 full paces of voters queuing up dutifully in the cold to cast their ballot. You'd have to be pretty cynical not to find that impressive.</p> <p>The line is 90% African American, I'd say, and every one of the people I spoke to were intending to vote for Barack Obama. This is Souls to the Polls day when black churches encourage their congregation from all over the city to come to the polling station and vote. I've come down here with a black church from the suburbs, God's Tabernacle of Faith. Pastor Thomas Eppinger finished his Sunday service, then piled his congregants into two vans and brought them to the polling station.</p> <p>It takes some determination on a cold day like this to join the very back of the queue. But that is what Barbara Dixon, 39, had just done when I spoke to her just now. She said she was happy to wait \"as long as it takes because I want to make sure this election is won by a president who has values that I care about\". She's got at least two hours to go before she gets to the voting booth, but really she didn't seem at all bothered.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-dd51ea76-1ff1-4d58-8dfd-c591cc8ca906\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/4/1352064233397/-460.jpeg\" alt=\"voters queue in Cleveland, Ohio\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People in Cleveland, Ohio, waited in long queues to cast early votes.

Saturday night was bitterly cold in Bristow, Virginia, but that didn\u2019t stop thousands coming to a rally addressed by the two best orators their party has produced since Robert Kennedy. \u201cIt\u2019s once in a lifetime,\u201d Jennifer Rodriguez, a nurse who\u2019d made the journey from Richmond, told me.</p> <p>Of course Bill Clinton has to play the support act these days, but he does so with huge heart. He bounded on stage in brown leather bomber jacket, wrapped up far less warmly than his audience, and delivered what was largely a reprise of his Charlotte showstopper, when he wowed the Democratic convention with a masterclass in substantive rhetoric, patiently laying out the policy-based reasons why the American people should re-elect their president. His voice was so hoarse, you wondered if it would give out. But the crowd stayed with him, lapping up the unarguable simplicity of lines such as \u201c\u2019We\u2019re all in this together\u2019 is better than \u2018you\u2019re on your own.\u2019\u201d And he can still work a rally like the most seasoned Catskills comic. Of Mitt Romney\u2019s multiple positions on the auto-bailout, Clinton said: \"He\u2019s tied himself up in so many knots, he could be hired as the chief contortionist of Cirque du Soleil.\u201d</p> <p>There were two moments of almost imperceptible tension. One came early, when Clinton confessed himself \u201cmore excited\u201d about supporting Barack Obama \u201ceven than I was four years ago.\u201d It brought a fleeting reminder that in early 2008, Bill Clinton was devoting all his red-faced energy to dismissing the Obama candidacy as a \u201cfairytale.\u201d Later the former president spoke of the ailment known as Romnesia, the habit of forgetting the Republican\u2019s past record. I\u2019m pretty sure I heard him add, as an aside, that \u201cHis opponent may even have got a bit of it.\u201d That sounded like a reference to Obama himself, an apparent dig at the president\u2019s failure, especially in the first debate, to nail Romney\u2019s many contradictions.</p> <p>If that's what it was, few noticed it. Instead, the crowd cheered for Obama when he come on to high-five and hug his predecessor - and cheered louder as he delivered a strong, confident and, at times, stirring performance. He lavished praise on Clinton, saying his team \u201ccalls him the Secretary of Explaining Stuff\u201d. He added that \u201cthe only person working harder than he is is Hillary.\u201d</p> <p>When the speeches were over, the two men worked the ropeline together to the sound of Clinton\u2019s old anthem, Don\u2019t Stop Thinking About Tomorrow. Yesterday the Clintons were Obama\u2019s foes. Today they are two of his most useful friends.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-4904d4d3-5714-4a5d-998e-7e76eee714bb\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/4/1352038483183/f647848e-9104-48a6-b46d-7885295c6730-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Bill Clinton and Barack Obama in Virginia\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Clinton and Barack Obama at their joint appearance in Bristow, Virginia, on Saturday night.

The quarterback hit him in stride, and Clay turned it upfield for a 31-yard score.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5096b6feb579f74bac764a3e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-04T18:42:06.472Z\">6.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">End of 1st quarter: Dolphins 3 Colts 7</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hartline is well on the way to enjoying his first big day since that week four explosion - reeling in passes of 35 and 10 yards to move the Dolphins down to the Indianapolis 35.

The Dolphins have won three straight and last week crushed the Jets 30-9 in New York.

Unfairly, but inevitably, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7302157/jim-mora-reflects-playoffs-moment\">many fans remember him for that one outburst above any of his career achievements</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwq7BYOnDrM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Qwq7BYOnDrM?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Mora was right to be sceptical, of course. \"Playoffs?! I just hope we can win another game,\" he exclaimed, and in the event they would win just another two. At the end of the season, he would be fired.</p> <p>The Colts would not miss the playoffs again for a decade - riding Peyton Manning to nine consecutive posteason berths. That was until last year, when the quarterback's neck surgery caused him to miss the entire year. When he was traded away to Denver in the offseason to make room for the rookie pick Andrew Luck, the assumption for many fans was that it would be at least another year before they returned.</p> <p>Luck might have been the No1 overall pick, but this team had won just two games without Manning the year before. And rare are the rookie signal callers who have been able to step in and win games immediately in the NFL. Even Manning had gone 3-13 in his first year in the league.</p> <p>But if the odds seemed stacked against Luck then they were even higher against Miami's Ryan Tannehill. Drafted eighth overall by the Dolphins, he was the third quarterback chosen behind Luck and Robert Griffin III. Although the team he joined had won six games the year before, they had also traded away their most talented offensive playmaker - Brandon Marshall - in the offseason.</p> <p>And yet, after eight weeks of the NFL season, both of these rookies have succeede in positioning their teams as legitimate playoff contenders - each with a 4-3 record. Were the postseason to start tomorrow, each would be in as a wildcard team. Whether they can maintain such form remains to be seen, but in a clustered AFC, the winner today will certainly be well positioned. Even the loser need not share Mora's doubt.</p> </div>   </div>",

  "<p>Poor sleep \u2013 as anyone who suffers from it knows \u2013 can make life a misery. And it is&#xa0;taking its toll on the nation's health. According to the recently published <a href=\"http://www.greatbritishsleepsurvey.com/2012report/\" title=\"\">Great British Sleep Survey</a>, more than 51% of us now struggle to get a good night's sleep, with women three times more likely to be affected than men.</p> <p>Evidence collected from 20,000-plus adults between March 2010 and this June shows that 93% of insomniacs report low energy levels and 83% complain of mood swings. Some 77% find it hard to concentrate, 64% say they are less productive at work, and 55% report relationship difficulties.</p> <p>Even worse, persistent poor sleep can increase the risk of developing conditions including diabetes, depression, high blood pressure and strokes. Research at the University of British Columbia suggests every hour of sleep lost at night <a href=\"http://liferesolutionsaustralia.wordpress.com/2012/09/20/how-sleep-loss-is-making-you-dumber/\" title=\"\">may cost us one IQ point the following day</a>. And it is often a long-term issue: a quarter of people with insomnia have suffered from it for more than 10 years.</p> <p>In Britain, overwhelmingly, we treat poor sleep with medication: the NHS spent a staggering <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/aug/20/sleeping-pills-britains-hidden-addiction\" title=\"\">\u00a350m on sleeping pills last year</a>, with 15.3m prescriptions dispensed across England, Scotland and Wales (up 17% in three years). But many pills have undesirable side-effects and the survey's findings suggest they do not solve long-term sleep problems: 42% of people who have taken them on and off have continued to have poor sleep for more than a decade.</p> <p>So how can we do something about poor sleep without pills? Most people focus first on what Colin Espie, professor of clinical psychology and director of the <a href=\"http://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/glasgowsleepcentre/\" title=\"\">University of Glasgow Sleep Centre</a>, calls \"sleep hygiene\": our pre-bed routine, and the physical environment in which we try to sleep. Espie believes these factors account for a mere 10% of sleep problems: \"most people with insomnia have better sleep hygiene than easy sleepers\". But most sleep experts concur that the following do make a difference.</p> <p><strong>Light.</strong> A dark room is important to a good sleep. Also try to avoid \"blue light\" less than two hours before bed: research by the Lighting Research Centre at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York State suggests light from laptop, tablet and smartphone screens <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9533249/Using-iPads-before-bed-can-lead-to-a-poor-nights-sleep.html\" title=\"\">tricks us into thinking it is daytime and keeps us alert</a>, although this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/reality-check/2012/sep/11/can-tablet-screens-disrupt-sleep\" title=\"\">has been disputed</a>. Bedrooms should be a comfortable temperature (around 18C), quiet and well-ventilated, with comfortable beds and pillows</p> <p><strong>Food, drink, exercise.</strong> Anything that stimulates the system \u2013 such as caffeine (although some experimental studies show a cup of coffee may lengthen the time taken to drop off by just three minutes), alcohol, chocolate, tobacco, a heavy meal or strenuous exercise \u2013 will make it harder to get to sleep. Indigestible foods are obviously best avoided; carbohydrates can promote serotonin, which aids sleep. Aim for a regular, balanced diet and no late-night excess. Twenty minutes a day of exercise will make a big difference to your sleep, but avoid it just before bed.</p> <p><strong>Sleep debt.</strong> A weekend lie-in or afternoon snooze can do more harm than good. According to research at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Centre, \"sleep debt\" is best \"repaid\" by <a href=\"http://www.medicaldaily.com/articles/12040/20120911/sleeping-weekends-makes-sleepier-during-week.htm\" title=\"\">getting up and going to bed at your normal times</a> rather than disrupting your body clock. Save sleep for bedtime: naps are recommended only if you are too exhausted to function.</p> <p><strong>Age.</strong> Not strictly sleep hygiene, and not much you can do about it either, but it may help to know that it can get harder to sleep as you get older. Research by the University of Washington Medicine Sleep Centre and others has shown our \"sleep architecture\" changes as we age: older people spend less time in deeper, non-REM sleep, and their whole body clock or circadian rhythm moves forward.</p> <p>\"Sleep hygiene\" alone, however, will not determine whether or not we sleep well. Ninety per cent of the battle is in&#xa0;the mind, which is why talking therapies and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) are coming to be seen as perhaps the most useful solution. Espie helped launch <a href=\"http://www.sleepio.com/about/\" title=\"\">Sleepio</a>, a pioneering online CBT programme that&#xa0;has won praise from the medical press, including the Lancet and the peer-reviewed journal Sleep. In a full clinical trial, it helped 75% of people with long-term poor sleep.</p> <p>So, get your head right, and you will&#xa0;usually sleep. But how? These are Espie's top tips:</p> <h2><strong>Pillow talk</strong></h2> <p><strong>1.</strong> Recognise that \"sleep is not a lifestyle choice, it is a biological inevitability. It is very, very powerful, and we need to get it working for us: a&#xa0;person not sleeping well has first and foremost to allow sleep to do its work. Sleep is a process of letting go.\"</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> Sleep's achilles heel, however, \"is our world. Most sleep problems are psychological obstacles that we put in sleep's way. Like all things we should do automatically, when we deliberately try to do them we screw up. Adopt a relaxed, confident approach to sleep, not a neurotic, panic-stricken one. Recognise there's a right and a wrong kind of effort. Your role model is the 'careless sleeper'.\"</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Go to sleep only when you feel sleepy and, if anything, shorten the time you try to sleep: \"A lot of people put good sleep beyond the achievable simply because they are so worried about not sleeping. Their sleep becomes frayed, even more broken. If I try to read a book in bed, it's never very successful because I go to bed when I'm ready to sleep. It's counter-intuitive, but a shorter sleep often means a better quality of sleep.\"</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> Put the day to bed long before putting yourself to bed. \"A racing mind \u2013 what happened today, what's on tomorrow, what will the future hold? \u2013 is a huge obstacle to sleep.

  "<p>We are disappointed that the Guardian now appears to accept the \"merit\" of the new system of press self-regulation being proposed by David Hunt of the <a href=\"http://www.pcc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Press Complaints Commission</a> and Guy Black of the Telegraph (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/01/leveson-inquiry-prejudging-the-judge?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Editorial</a>, 2 November). You admit yourselves that their plan \"vests too much power in an industry funding body which retains key powers over the regulator\", but you fail to take this to its logical conclusion: that it is little more than a reinvention of the same system of self-regulation which has failed the public and journalism for the last 60 years.</p> <p>We share your commitment to \"independent regulation, both from politicians and the press itself\". This cannot be achieved by a system controlled by the same press interests which have dominated the failed PCC. Moreover, as so far described, the Hunt-Black plan has no means of ensuring that all major press companies sign up (the so-called \"Desmond problem\"), nor any foolproof method of enforcing its rulings. Civil contracts can be challenged in the courts, and the worst offenders are no strangers to litigating their way out of trouble.</p> <p>Were it not for the Guardian's commitment to courageous and outstanding investigative journalism \u2013 in the teeth of bitter resistance by the PCC and its controlling press interests \u2013 we would never have discovered the true scale of abuse and corruption in parts of the press. This is surely the moment to push for a genuinely independent regulator, founded in law, which could command real public trust and reinvigorate public interest journalism. For the Guardian meekly to surrender this opportunity in favour of yet more self-regulation is a sad finale to its own exemplary journalism.<br><strong>Professor Steven Barnett </strong><em>Professor of communications, University of Westminster</em><br><strong>Professor Stuart Allan </strong><em>Professor of journalism, University of Bournemouth</em><br><strong>Professor John Corner </strong><em>Visiting professor in communications studies, University of Leeds</em><br><strong>Professor James Curran </strong><em>Professor of communications, Goldsmiths, University of London</em><br><strong>Professor Natalie Fenton </strong><em>Professor of communications, Goldsmiths, University of London</em><br><strong>Professor Matthew Flinders </strong><em>Professor of politics, University of Sheffield</em><br><strong>Professor Chris Frost </strong><em>Professor of journalism, Liverpool John Moores University</em><br><strong>Professor Ivor Gaber </strong><em>Research professor in media and politics, University of Bedfordshire</em><br><strong>Professor Thomas Gibbons </strong><em>Professor of law, University of Manchester</em><br><strong>Professor David Hutchison </strong><em>Visiting professor in media policy, Glasgow Caledonian University</em><br><strong>Professor Joni Lovenduski </strong><em>Professor of politics, Birkbeck, University of London</em><br><strong>Dr Tim Markham </strong><em>Reader in journalism and media, Birkbeck, University of London</em><br><strong>Professor Maire Messenger Davies </strong><em>Professor of media studies, University of Ulster</em><br><strong>Professor Julian Petley </strong><em>Professor of screen media, Brunel University</em><br><strong>Professor Greg Philo </strong><em>Professor of communications, University of Glasgow</em><br><strong>Professor Richard Sambrook </strong><em>Professor of journalism, Cardiff University</em><br><strong>Professor Philip Schlesinger </strong><em>Professor in cultural policy, University of Glasgow</em><br><strong>Professor Jean Seaton </strong><em>Professor of media history, University of Westminster</em><br><strong>Professor Frank Webster </strong><em>Professoressor of sociology, City University</em><br><strong>Professor Lorna Woods </strong><em>Professor of law, City University</em></p>",
  "<p>Apparently, Pakistanis don't need the Taliban to destroy their schools any more \u2013 they can do it themselves. Last week, a girls' high school <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/Angry-protesters-set-girls-school-on-fire-in-Lahore/articleshow/17046182.cms\" title=\"\">was set ablaze</a> in Pakistan's second largest city, Lahore. And no, the Taliban were not the culprits. A mob, enraged after allegations of blasphemy against a teacher, carried out the attack. Instead of taking action against them, the police arrested the school's 77-year-old owner.</p> <p>The accused teacher, who allegedly committed blasphemy by photocopying the wrong page of a book for homework, is in hiding. Pakistan may have <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-12691844\" title=\"\">declared an \"education emergency\"</a> earlier this year, but it still fails to protect the schools it already has. How did we get here?</p> <p>\"They have shut down girls' schools,\" I told a childhood friend who was effusively praising the Pakistani Taliban after its temporary <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_8107000/8107589.stm\" title=\"\">takeover of the Swat valley</a> three years ago. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/10/malala-yousafzai-bullet-removed-taliban\" title=\"\">Malala Yousafzai</a>, the 14-year-old Pakistani peace activist shot last month by the Taliban, was a bored 11-year-old schoolgirl then. My friend lived about 350 miles away from Swat, and had three daughters. His reasons for liking the Taliban were simple: they were local heroes who had decided to take things into their own hands. \"If only people in our area had the same courage,\" he said. \"Would you like a Taliban-type system here in your city?\" I asked him. Yes, of course, he would.</p> <p>Every morning, my friend drove two of his daughters to school and was pretty certain that one of them would go to medical school. \"But the Taliban don't allow girls' education. What will happen when they shut down your daughters' school?\" I asked. My friend was puzzled, but only for a moment. \"They wouldn't do that <em>here</em>. What they did in Swat is their culture, Pashtun&#xa0;culture.\"</p> <p>Not educating girls is not the only myth about Pashtuns: Pashtun mothers produce sons so that they can send them to war; fathers will shoot their daughters if a stranger sees their faces. Of course, as the myth goes, they also don't want to send their daughters to schools. And why do they need to send their sons to school anyway, if they are born soldiers in an eternal jihad?</p> <p>But there was no evidence of any such Pashtun culture in the Swat valley I had visited the day before our conversation. When the Taliban made their bid to rule the region, Swat could have easily passed as the education capital of Pakistan. There were law schools, medical schools, nursing schools and more computer schools than any other valley of this size could accommodate. And that's without counting the hundreds of informal beauty schools that provide on-the-job training for girls so poor they can't afford any other type of education.</p> <p>A lot of Pakistanis, as well as people the world over, have expressed their solidarity with Malala by doing the obligatory status update or tweet: \"<a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/10/10/We_Are_All_Malala\" title=\"\">We are all Malala</a>\". But for most people, she is someone else's child and will remain so. She is a child whose name can be invoked to start another military operation, a child whose name can be used to prove the blindingly obvious \u2013 that parents, whatever their religion or culture, would like their children to be at school \u2013 if they can afford it.</p> <p>What is conveniently ignored in the debate over Malala is the fact that every 10th child in the world who doesn't go to school is Pakistani. The Taliban are not the only ones keeping kids out of school. Some fairly secularly minded people think of Pakistan's children as someone else's children \u2013 not deserving the education that their money buys for their own kids. As such, Pakistan is a booming marketplace for private education. Ask anyone on the street, and they'll tell you it's the biggest business in Pakistan.</p> <p>You can see people on donkey carts driving their children to private schools that offer English-medium education in air-conditioned rooms for 400 rupees a month. Every morning, in every small town and city, you can see kids \u2013 three on a bicycle, five on a motorbike, 10 squeezed into a rickshaw \u2013 all heading for a school somewhere. Girls top almost all university exam tables in Pakistan.</p> <p>Whatever sad destiny the country may be hurtling towards, there is one thing standing between Pakistan and the Taliban's dream of heaven on earth: the number of women who have been to school, and the number of women who couldn't go to school but are determined to send their daughters to school, no matter the economic imperative. Whatever your ideas about a good Muslim girl, you can't really lock up 90 million of them behind closed doors.</p> <p>Listen to the Taliban, not to their cuddly intellectual friends, and you begin to get a clearer picture. Their apologists in political parties may try to prove that girls' education is an invention of the infidels, but the Taliban seem to know what they are talking about. An educated female population is more threatening to them than armies equipped with all-seeing drones. Every girl who crams for a high-school exam, every woman who runs a hospital, and every semi-educated mother who makes sure her daughter gets a better education than she herself received, is a mortal threat to the Taliban's declared ambition that every little girl who talks about school gets it in the head.</p> <p>By abdicating its responsibility to educate our children, to protect those who manage to go to school and those who teach them, Pakistan is making it that much easier for the Taliban's mission to succeed.</p>",
  "<p>The UK boasts several internationally significant populations of ash that require the highest levels of protection. These will be lost if we do not urgently target resources to these areas to try to at least slow progress of the ash dieback disease (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/02/ash-tree-disease-10-years\" title=\"\">Most UK ash trees will be diseased 'within 10 years'</a>, 3 November).</p> <p>Top of the list must be those in the Lake District, which includes significant numbers of ash in ancient semi-natural woodlands and many hundreds of ancient pollards. Pollarding (lopping branches off trees at a height of 3-4m above ground on a regular cycle) is integral to the silvopastoral system practiced for centuries in the region.</p> <p>In valleys such as Borrowdale there are specimens many hundreds of years old which provide vital habitat for rare lichens, birds, bats and invertebrates. They are as much part of the landscape as the lakes, Herdwick sheep and vernacular architecture.</p> <p>Our experience with dutch elm disease, foot and mouth and red squirrel conservation, tells us that core populations need to be identified for disease exclusion. We must apply the lessons of history and urgently direct resources to our most valuable ash populations. <br><strong>Edward R Wilson</strong> <br><em>Penrith, Cumbria</em></p> <p>\u2022 On Radio 4 it was reported that Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, has said there was no delay in implementing precautions to prevent the spread of <em>Chalara fraxinea</em>, the fungus that causes ash dieback. He said all precautions have been appropriate.</p> <p>The Guardian (1 November) <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/31/uk-forests-unprecedented-threat-disease\" title=\"\">printed a timeline</a> which says the Horticultural Trades Association reported the disease had become widespread in Denmark in 2009 and that it called for a ban on imports. The government took no action.</p> <p>European countries have been asking for a ban on importation of sapling over the last two years. Nothing happened.</p> <p>In February 2012 the disease was reportedly present in a nursery in Buckinghamshire. No action was taken.</p> <p>In the summer of 2012 ash dieback was detected in plantations and nurseries across Scotland and in the UK. No action was taken. In October 2012 cases were identified in Norfolk and Suffolk. The government announced a period of public consultation which \"might lead to a ban on importation of saplings\".</p> <p>We are told \"100,000 ash trees have been felled\" to prevent disease spreading. I understand that 100,000 saplings have been destroyed.</p> <p>On 26 October Paterson announced there would be a ban on importing ash saplings. Does Paterson have a different concept of \"no delay\"?<br><strong>David Hurry</strong><br><em>Hurstpierpoint, West Sussex</em></p> <p>\u2022 I congratulate your correspondents, particularly Sara Maitland (We're all tree huggers now, 1 November) regarding the ash disaster. There is no defence against an airborne virus so it must be accepted the majority of ash in the UK will die. Then all efforts to minimise timber loss must be put in place. To do this, unaffected trees must be felled and stored for future use. We would then have ash timber available for 20 years. This would give tree owners a return from their losses. Diseased trees should be used for firewood. There is no point in restricting movement unless the Forestry Commission can prevent the airborne virus and prevent the wind from blowing affected leaves across the countryside.</p> <p>To make matters worse, Forestry Commission Scotland is to force owners of infected ash trees to destroy them or be fined \u00a35,000. Threatening owners with fines does not make for good relations, particularly as the commission may be blamed for allowing contaminated nursery stock from Europe into Britain. The Forestry Commission cannot continue saying \"it wisna' me\".&#xa0;</p> <p>Unfortunately, I can foresee multiple claims against the Forestry Commission going through the courts.</p> <p>In the meantime, I have asked the local Forestry Commission conservator for a meeting with other interested parties to clear the air and hopefully go forward together to make the best of a very bad job.</p> <p>Perhaps this time common sense will prevail over red tape.<br><strong>Donald Barker</strong><br><em>CEO, Broadleaf Trust, Auchtermuchty, Fife</em></p> <p>\u2022 We are not nature's custodians (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/31/biosecurity-nature-hurricane-sandy-ash\" title=\"\">Editorial</a>, 1 November). She is ours; and she will cast us aside as blithely as she did any extinct species you care to think of.<br><strong>Joseph Byrne</strong><br><em>Ennis County Clare, Ireland</em></p> <p>\u2022 If only I'd known! For 30 years I have struggled to uproot the determined crop of ash seedlings springing up in my garden. Had any nursery appealed for supplies before importing them from the Netherlands, I'd have happily obliged.<br><strong>Dr Janet Sturgis</strong><br><em>Tunbridge Wells, Kent</em></p> <p>\u2022 Back in October 2010 in an investigation into the threats facing Britain's trees, I reported the warnings of Prof Clive Brasier of Forest Research, part of the Forestry Commission, \"whose research on the Phytophthora pathogens,\" I wrote, \"should have caused alarm bells to ring some time ago.\" Brasier was clear that the international protocols that govern the trade and movement of trees and root stocks hadn't been properly revisited since the 1950s and were now inadequate. The trade in plants, said Brasier at the time, \"is now highly globalised and yet most European nurseries and plant health organisations have little knowledge that they may be harbouring exotic Phytophthora pathogens \u2013 pathogens that should never have made their way to Europe at all.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>I concluded the article by saying: '\"Even as we digest the unpalatable truth that a broad variety of our native and non-native trees are under sustained attack from imported pathogens, it is being reported that yet another new fungus is now killing ash trees in parts of Europe. If the experience of the horse chestnut, larch and alder are anything to go by, it will soon be here \u2013 if it's not here already.\"</p> <p>Ministers have received repeated warnings, and have chosen to do nothing until now, and now it may be too late. This staggering degree of incompetence has been compounded by the earlier threat to sell off Britain's forests, and the subsequent heavy cuts to Forestry Commission budgets.</p> <p>Sadly the recent history of multi-agency failure, government cutbacks and new bureaucratic hoops to leap through has largely undone the vitally important work of dedicated individuals and the local authorities in the dutch elm disease control area between Brighton and Eastbourne. Here, some of Britain's finest remaining rural stands of mature elm are fast falling to the disease that devastated the countryside in 1970s. The dutch elm disease epidemic was, and remains, the most obvious reminder of what can happen if the globalised trade in timber and plants is not properly regulated \u2013 as it is in other island nations such as New Zealand.</p> <p>Fortunately the London-based Conservation Foundation, which has done so much to highlight the plight of the elm and repopulate the country with more disease resistant varieties (sadly the English elm has no resistance to the disease), is determined to try and save some of the remaining rural elms in East Sussex, possibly through annual anti-fungal injections.</p> <p>But whether the government has finally learned some lessons, and is able to counter the deadly ash disease and other threats to our native trees, we shall soon discover.<br><strong>Mark Seddon</strong><br><em>Singleborough, Buckinghamshire</em></p>",

District3 had a particularly bad time of it yesterday, but Christopher Maloney performed in the Death Slot and Kye Sones just sort of berked around like some sort of appalling busker with boundary issues and an inherent inability to apply eyeliner properly. What\u2019s more, Rylan\u2019s schtick is starting to become wearisome and even Ella might have hwanged her way into trouble. Basically, I don\u2019t know who\u2019ll be eliminated from X Factor tonight. I could have just said that first and saved everyone a lot of effort. Maybe next time.</p> <p>But that\u2019s not all. As well as the elimination, we can also look forward to guest spots from Rita Ora and last night\u2019s hapless masterclassers No Doubt, who apparently exist again. All that AND Dermot O\u2019Leary\u2019s now legendary mime of someone attacking a cow. What sort of idiot would miss that? I\u2019ll be back here at 8pm to liveblog X Factor into next week. In the meantime, why not say hello in the comments and have a bit of a guilty cry at Surprise, Surprise? I know I will. Back soon!</p> </div>   </div>",
  "<p>It is a Mitt Romney unfamiliar to most Americans. He appears with a bronze tan. He speaks of his father's Mexican upbringing. He makes no mention of undocumented immigrants. He speaks Spanish. \"Soy Mitt Romney, y apruebo este mensaje\". I'm Mitt Romney, and I approve this message.</p> <p>The Republican party's right-wing would probably be less approving but it tends not to see or hear such messages because this version of Romney airs on Spanish-language media and is aimed at Latino voters.</p> <p>The GOP and Super Pac supporters have ramped up this parallel advertising campaign in swing states such as Colorado, Florida and Nevada as a protective wall against the wave of Latino support for President Barack Obama. It does not appear to have worked. Consecutive polls show Obama leading Romney by around 70% to 30%.</p> <p>\"Much of the Spanish-language advertising for the Romney campaign has been very, very bad,\" said Gary Segura, a professor of political science at Stanford university and a principal at the polling firm <a href=\"http://www.latinodecisions.com/blog/about/\">Latino Decisions</a>. \"Although given the circumstances, there's not much any advertising campaign could have done.\"</p> <p>The circumstances are the hard line Romney took on undocumented immigrants to clinch the Republican nomination earlier this year. He called for \"self-deportation\" \u2013 a euphemism to make life so miserable for the undocumented they leave the United States \u2013 and appointed <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-leopold/mitt-romneys-kris-kobach-_b_1903051.html?utm_hp_ref=\" immigration-reform\"\">Kris Kobach</a>, the architect of Arizona's draconian immigration law, as an adviser.</p> <p>Romney recognised the damage. Back in April reporters overheard him at a private fundraiser in Florida warning that Obama's lead among Latinos \"<a href=\"http://colorlines.com/archives/2012/04/mitt_romney_not_winning_latino_vote_spells_doom_for_us.html\">spells doom for us</a>\".</p> <p>Republican strategists concluded Romney did not need to match George W Bush's 44% Latino support in 2004 but that he needed to do significantly better than John McCain's 31% in 2008.</p> <p>Romney dispatched his son Craig, a former missionary in Chile who speaks fluent Spanish, to tour swing states. And in September the candidate appeared on Univision, the Spanish-language TV behemoth, to be grilled by Mar\u00eda Elena Salinas and Jorge Ramos, the Walter Cronkite of Latino media.</p> <p>Republican organisers packed the audience with whooping supporters and Romney acquitted himself reasonably well but commentary focused on his unusually deep, orange-tinted tan which <a href=\"http://univisionnews.tumblr.com/post/32196711271/its-not-an-oompa-loompa-its-mitt-romney\">triggered mocking accusations</a> of cosmetic pandering to Latinos.</p> <p>\"Too bad the oompa loompa population dwindled 25 years ago,\" said one tweet.</p> <p>Romney aides said he had been campaigning in Florida sunshine before the show.</p> <p>With Latino numbers not improving the GOP and Super Pac backers like Crossroads GPS spent about $4.6m on Spanish-language television stations in Colorado, Florida and Nevada, according to Kantar media.</p> <p>The ads were mostly translated versions of Romney's English-language ads, tweaked to include references to his father's Mexican heritage and the \"Soy Mitt Romney\" sign-off at the end.</p> <p>He hammered the theme he would be a better economic steward. \"Our economic recovery needs the success of the Hispanic community, but President Obama's misguided policies are dragging down businesses.\"</p> <p>Another ad showed euphoria for Obama in 2008, followed by Latino voters detailing broken promises. Another ad lamented Latino poverty and unemployment. \"When Obama and his Democratic allies tell us 'Yes we can,' we have to tell them, 'We can't take anymore,'\" says the narrator.</p> <p>The Obama campaign, however, spent twice almost as much, $8.9m, and the president, who like Romney does not speak Spanish, mastered phonetics for a 30-second spot of passable Spanish.</p> <p>\"In the young people known as the Dreamers I see the same qualities that Michelle and I try to instil in our daughters,\" he intones, referring to young undocumented immigrants seeking citizenship. Images show the Obama family, followed by studious Latinos. \"As a father, they inspire me. And as president, their bravery has reminded me that no obstacle is too large, and no road is too long.\"</p> <p>Another spot features Cristina Saralegui, a television presenter dubbed the Latina Oprah, endorsing Obama in colloquial, rhyming Spanish. \"Pa'tras? De eso nada! Pa'lante \u2013 con Obama!\" Going backward? None of that. Forward \u2013 with Obama!</p> <p>The president scored additional points in May by phoning in to the popular Denver-based KBNO radio show, La Voz del Pueblo, to josh with the host Fernando Sergio about, among other things, the Broncos. Romney declined invitations to do likewise. Last week <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jason-salzman/fernando-sergio-obama-endorsement_b_2006681.html\">Sergio endorsed Obama</a>.</p> <p>The president also appeared on the same Univision forum as Romney (on a separate day) for the requested hour, unlike his rival who gave only 30 minutes. Pressed by the hosts over the lack of immigration reform, Obama said it was his term's biggest failure, a devastating admission were it not for Romney's vulnerability on the issue.</p> <p>\"Some of Obama's ads go too far, they hint that the <a href=\"http://www.dhs.gov/deferred-action\">deferred action process</a>is a path to citizenship when it's not, but Romney has no credibility with Latinos. We can tell when we're being attacked,\" said Jessie Ramirez, 31, a high school career guidance counsellor at a Democratic rally in Denver.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2012/11/01/obama-has-almost-identical-lead-with-latinos-as-2008-poll-says/\">Fox News poll </a>on Friday showed Obama leading Romney among Latinos by 66% to 28% \u2013 a whopping margin keeping him competitive in Florida, Ohio, Nevada and New Mexico.</p> <p>Seguro, the analyst and pollster, said the Republican strategy, based on attack ads, now seemed to be discouraging Latinos from voting. \"My sense is they've given up on trying to persuade and are trying to suppress by making people think, a pox on both your houses.\"</p>",

  "<p>Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is moaning that missile strikes haven't hit Israel hard enough. The Americans say they support Israel's military attack on Iran the previous day, but won't actively engage in this war. And the Israelis are counting their country's civilian deaths and wondering if they should launch a second strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, to \"finish the job\".</p> <p>This is all part of a war simulation game staged by an Israeli thinktank last month, to which a <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/articles/nuclear-war-games-feature\" title=\"\">British film crew were given sole access</a>. The result is a game-time enactment of what would happen if Israel does attack Iran.</p> <p>For some time, Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu has been escalating talk of a military strike, to prevent Iran from building its first nuclear weapon. The prospect of war, and recent disaster drills to prepare for it, have terrified his own people, and the rest of the world. Israeli military and intelligence chiefs say a strike is a bad idea, while the Obama administration has told Israel to back off and wait for sanctions to work.</p> <p>If Israel hit Iran's nuclear facilities, would Hezbollah, Iran's allies in Lebanon, join in to retaliate? Would America step in to help its best friend in the Middle East? This filmed simulation shows a group of Israeli ex-spooks, former politicians and military officials split into teams to role-play the consequences. I have not seen the full film, but was in the cutting room for a couple of days helping with translation and the scenes I saw were compelling. Team Israel, taking stock of Iranian missile attacks on civilian targets, makes the operational assumption that the situation won't spiral totally out of control.</p> <p>Is that a reasonable prediction, or totally delusional? The documentary has an interview with an Iranian former nuclear negotiator and foreign policy adviser, who returns the simulated salvo by saying that Israel has grossly underestimated Iran's capacity for retaliation. Iran, he says, would assume American complicity in any Israeli attack and take aim at US targets in the Middle East. When the US staged their own simulation of this same situation, in March, it predicted that an Israeli strike would lead to a wider regional war.</p> <p>Now, the UK is thinking about <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/exclusive-pm-on-standby-to-send-warplanes-to-gulf-as-iranian-tensions-rise-8274748.html\" title=\"\">putting warplanes in the Persian Gulf</a> as tensions rise. And American military commanders have warned Israel that an attack on Iran could <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/31/us-warns-israel-strike-iran\" title=\"\">stunt US action</a>, by cutting off key logistics support from Gulf countries that host US bases.</p> <p>Watching scenes from <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/episode-guide/series-112/episode-5\" title=\"\">Nuclear War Games</a>, the bit that struck me most was a clip in which the Israeli role-players, having achieved their attack goals, are talking about a UN resolution \u2013 wondering if they should launch a final strike before ceasefire, and whether the US can be persuaded to make the resolution state \"regret\" rather than \"condemnation\" over Israel's actions.

When Hill masterminded the famous 1952 Eastcastle Street robbery of \u00a3230,000 from a Post Office van, Gyp insisted on being one of the getaway drivers and they counted out the money in a suite at the Dorchester.</p> <p>In 1955, the couple tried to move to Australia but, by the time they reached New Zealand via the Pacific, it was clear Australia would not admit them. \"It makes you sick when you think we have come this far,\" Gyp told the Daily Express. \"If only we had known sooner, we could have got off earlier \u2013 in Tahiti.\"</p> <p>The actor Diana Dors became a pal and, in Cannes, Gyp met Picasso and Aristotle Onassis, who made a pass at her, according to Billy Hill's son, Justin, author of Billy Hill, Gyp and Me. Justin says of his father that \"there was no shortage of girls auditioning to be his moll\" but Gyp was his \"criminal muse\". (Justin is Hill's son by a dancer, Diana Harris, who killed herself when he was a baby; Gypsy became his adoptive mum.)</p> <p>Gyp spent time in prison awaiting trial for smashing a table-lamp into the face of a man who made a mocking reference to her fur coat \u2013 \"look at her, in her rabbit\" \u2013 in a nightclub in Paddington in 1957. But was later cleared after witnesses suffered mysterious memory losses.</p> <p>She moved to Tangier, where Hill had a club called Churchill's, kept a chimpanzee as a pet and eventually moved back to Britain and retired from the fray. Justin remembers her enjoying a spliff while watching Widows, the 1980s ITV series about gangsters' wives who carry out a robbery.</p> <p>Gypsy died in 2004. Surely a film of her life must be on the horizon.</p>",
  "<p>Authorities in the north-east United States are warning of a new crisis facing the region as cold weather heads towards tens of thousands of people who still have no power or heat and are living in homes damaged by superstorm Sandy.</p> <p>While much of New York City is approaching a semblance of normality, state governor Andrew Cuomo and the city's mayor Michael Bloomberg said on Sunday that plummeting temperatures were now one of the main threats facing residents in other stricken areas such as Staten Island and Long Island.</p> <p>Cuomo warned of a \"massive, massive housing problem\", with up to 40,000 people \u2013 mainly residents of public housing \u2013 needing relocating because of damage from the storm and the lack of electricity and heat.</p> <p>\"People are in homes that are uninhabitable,\" Cuomo told reporters at a press briefing. \"It's going to become increasingly clear that they're uninhabitable when the temperature drops and the heat doesn't come on.\"</p> <p>Fuel shortages are also having an impact on people with back-up generators. \"There are continuing issues with the fuel delivery and fuel distribution system,\" he said. </p> <p>But he added that \"there has been improvement, [and] there will be more improvement.\"</p> <p>The White House has sanctioned the release of an additional 12m gallons of unleaded fuel and 10m gallons of diesel. Much of that gas was being trucked to New Jersey and New York throughout the weekend.</p> <p>In the worst-hit areas of New York and New Jersey, which are still suffering six days after Sandy hit, there is growing anger among residents at the official response.</p> <p>In the Rockaways, an oceanfront section of Queens, Bloomberg was barracked by people as he toured the devastation over the weekend. Thousands there are still without power, and have been told they may remain so for days to come.</p> <p>\"When are we going to get some help?\" one woman shouted during an angry confrontation on Saturday.</p> <p>City officials have turned to opening warming shelters in preparation for a drop of temperatures overnight.</p> <p>Elderly people were being urged to move to these temporary homes. Meanwhile, about 25,000 blankets were being handed out to those who refused to move.</p> <p>But many believe the measures represent too little, too late, with some residents accusing the city of forgetting them in the rush to get the lights back on in the financial centre of lower Manhattan.</p> <p>\"Nothing right is going on here. There's old ladies in my building that have got nothing,\" one resident told Bloomberg during his walkabout in the Rockaways. In a one-to-one with the mayor, the man complained: \"This is the first drop-off site over the bridge, [and] we can't even get a bottle of water or a hot chocolate.\"</p> <p>Bloomberg promised that help was at hand, insisting that he understood their grievances.</p> <p>\"I spoke with many people who were worried and frustrated and cold,\" the mayor said at a press briefing Saturday. \"There is no power there and temperatures are dropping. Even those who have generators are having a hard time getting fuel.\"</p> <p>Gas shortages could continue for days, New Yorkers were told Sunday. Throughout the weekend, lines of cars queued up at pumps across New York. In neighbouring New Jersey, governor Chris Christie imposed rationing to cope with the scarcity of gas.</p> <p>At least 10 arrests have so far been made in relation to confrontations and line jumping at petrol stations.</p> <p>While parts of Staten Island and remote parts of Queens continue to struggle with blackouts, Manhattan is on its way to being restored to business as usual.</p> <p>Schools are due to reopen on Monday after a week out, and much of the subway will be running, though Cuomo warned commuters that the system may struggle to cope with the weight of traffic. \"There's been major progress but it's not going to be normal tomorrow,\" he said. </p> <p>\"South Ferry station, which had been a large fish tank, has now been pumped dry,\" he added. </p> <p>Cuomo also warned utilities firms that they would be held accountable for any delays that could have been prevented.</p> <p>\"I want them to provide the service that they get paid to perform,\" he said, adding: \"We will be reasonable, but we will hold them accountable.\"</p> <p>Bloomberg echoed governor Cuomo's call on utilities firms to up their game.</p> <p>\"We urge them to commit more resources to get power back to the Rockaways,\" the mayor said in an update on recovery efforts.</p> <p>Bloomberg also stressed the need to keep warm and check on vulnerable neighbours who made need help.</p> <p>\"It is cold outside and it will remain cold in the coming days. It is critical that people stay warm,\" he said in a Sunday afternoon press briefing.</p> <p>He spoke of an \"enormous outpouring\" of donations of clothes and food from members of the public but added that money sent to the Mayor's Fund would do more good at this stage as charity organisations were at capacity.</p> <p>Power had now been restored to all but 145,000 people across New York City. But 19,000 homes in the Rockaways \u2013 one of the worst hit areas \u2013 remained without electricity.</p>",

  "<p>With so many managers determined to dominate possession with the use of three central midfielders, Premier League matches featuring two proper strike partnerships have become increasingly rare. But with Jamie Mackie operating just behind Djibril Ciss\u00e9, plus Jason Roberts and Noel Hunt working the channels at the other end, this was effectively a clash between two 4-4-2s.</p> <p>Despite the similarity in formations, Queens Park Rangers and Reading played completely different styles of football. Brian McDermott's side started strongly with a somewhat basic, traditional gameplan \u2013 they fielded two tricky wingers, spread the play wide and attacked directly. Their two forwards drifted into wide positions, finding space in behind the QPR full-backs, and won corners when trying to beat centre-backs on the outside. Reading appealed ferociously whenever the ball crossed the byline after a tackle, suggesting a particular keenness to win corners \u2013 and with good reason. Mark Hughes's side were disorganised when defending dead-ball situations, and floated deliveries towards the debutant Sean Morrison consistently caused problems.</p> <p>In contrast to Reading's combination of width and set-pieces, QPR were attempting to play intricate, technical football; Mackie dragged Kaspars Gorkss out of position and Ciss\u00e9 also dropped unusually deep. In combination with the movement of Junior Hoilett and Adel Taarabt inside from the flanks, QPR were overloading Reading's midfield duo, and getting men between the lines to shoot from the edge of the box. Samba Diakit\u00e9 contributed to this, sliding forward unnoticed from a central midfield position and dribbling forward ambitiously, leaving Esteban Granero to protect the defence. The majority of QPR's shots were from central positions, around 25 yards from goal \u2013 mainly from Taarabt, who had eight attempts, but Granero also went close from a couple of free-kicks after rash Reading tackles, when QPR's attackers had slipped into the space behind the midfield.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398846848\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/11/4/1352053881429/QPRs-wingers-moved-inside-001.jpg\" alt=\"QPR's wingers moved inside and Diakit\u00e9 dribbled forward to overload Reading between the lines\" width=\"620\" height=\"620\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">QPR's wingers moved inside and Diakit\u00e9 dribbled forward to overload Reading between the lines. Photograph: Graphic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Interestingly, Tottenham also encountered problems in that zone against QPR a couple of months ago. Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas's solution was to push his defence higher in the second half, minimising the space between defence and midfield, but Spurs were facing Bobby Zamora that day. That was harder with the threat of Ciss\u00e9's pace in behind, so Gorkss and Morrison defended deep and often had to charge towards the edge of the box to block shots.</p> <p>Morrison's aerial prowess had a key impact at both ends. He won two consecutive headers in the move that lead to Gorkss's goal, and was first to the majority of J\u00falio C\u00e9sar's goal-kicks \u2013 the Brazilian eventually started to spray the ball wide, but should have realised sooner that Ciss\u00e9 was winning nothing in the air. Morrison did miss a header for Ciss\u00e9's goal, possibly the only time the Frenchman outfoxed him in the game, but deserves to retain his place for next week's home fixture with Norwich \u2013 a game Reading really must win.</p> <p>At the other end, it was interesting to see the left-footed Anton Ferdinand playing to the right of the centre-back pairing, and right-footed Ryan Nelsen to the left. Their opposite numbers weren't technically impressive but moved the ball swiftly forward \u2013 not once did Gorkss and Morrison exchange passes, and the central midfielders Jay Tabb and Mikele Leigertwood rarely passed the ball backwards. Reading do not use possession to control the tempo, only to attack \u2013 explaining why they have the joint-lowest average possession this season alongside Stoke, but have attempted the joint-most crosses with Manchester United.</p> <p>Substitutions had little impact \u2013 McDermott replaced both his wingers, and while the pacy Jimmy K\u00e9b\u00e9 had a couple of bright moments down the right, he was less effective when Hughes replaced the tired left-back Armand Traor\u00e9 with Nedum Onuoha.</p> <p>With both clubs still looking for their first league victory, neither manager will have been particularly pleased with a point \u2013 QPR's dominance in open play was cancelled out by Reading's threat from set-pieces, and neither made significant tactical changes to alter the pattern of the game.</p> <h2>Liverpool need to play to their strengths</h2> <p>For the second consecutive weekend \u2013 following a fine first-half performance on the break against Everton \u2013 Liverpool looked significantly more dangerous when they attacked directly at speed, rather than when focusing upon interminable passing sequences.</p> <p>Luis Suarez's superb goal owed much to immaculate close control rather than a tactical plan, and it's unlikely that many goals will arise from long Jose Enrique passes this season. But the point remains \u2013 Suarez thrives when he receives direct passes into space, rather than when forced to battle multiple defenders packing the penalty box. The pace of Suso and Raheem Sterling also caused problems, while Steven Gerrard played a couple of excellent long diagonal balls in behind the defence.</p> <p>Gerrard criticised Everton for playing direct football last weekend, comments he later retracted. Yet Enrique's chip down the line was not dissimilar from the type of passes Leighton Baines regularly plays, and Liverpool might benefit from more immediate passing moves \u2013 they lack incisive passers, yet have plenty of driving midfielders and quick attackers. Rodgers must play to Liverpool's strengths.</p> <h2>Rooney and Van Persie impress in attack and defence</h2> <p>Robin van Persie acknowledged his growing partnership with Wayne Rooney following the 2-1 victory over Arsenal, describing them both as 'No9-and-a-halves' \u2013 somewhere between deep-lying forward and goalscorer. But the most impressive thing about their performances on Saturday afternoon was their defensive discipline. </p> <p>Rooney practically man-marked Mikel Arteta and prevented the Spaniard from starting Arsenal's passing moves. Van Persie, meanwhile, generally positioned himself close to Thomas Vermaelen, which meant Arsenal instead had to play out through Per Mertescker, a significantly weaker passer. United haven't looked entirely secure at the back this season, so the work rate of last season's Premier League top scorers proved particularly valuable, as Arsenal's passing was extremely slow.</p> <p><em>Michael Cox is the editor of <a href=\"http://www.zonalmarking.net/\">zonalmarking.net</a></em></p>",

  "<p>In 2006 the publisher of the Daily Mail passed up the opportunity to sell its regional newspaper business for about \u00a31bn, after bidders declined to meet its lofty expectations of a \u00a31.5bn price tag.</p> <p>Daily Mail &amp; General Trust is now poised to hive off regional operation Northcliffe Media, home to titles including the Leicester Mercury and Nottingham Post, into a joint venture led by former Mirror Group Newspapers and Mecom chief executive David Montgomery that values it at about \u00a3100m.</p> <p>This plummeting valuation highlights the battering the regional press has taken in the intervening period, with the industry one of the media sectors hardest hit by the growth of the internet and the post-credit crunch recession.</p> <p>Sales have slumped \u2014 the Leicester Mercury sold almost 100,000 copies a day a decade ago, today it sells 45,000 \u2014 along with advertising revenues. When DMGT rejected a \u00a31bn offer for Northcliffe in 2006, total annual UK regional newspaper advertising was \u00a32.5bn; today it is \u00a31bn and continuing to decline rapidly, according to media buying agency Group M.</p> <p>Further consolidation has been widely expected, and last week the starting gun was effectively fired with Montgomery's move, the first stage of a plan that he believes will reinvigorate the ailing sector. \"The industry is on a one-way street \u2013 everyone has been waiting for something to happen and unless there is market consolidation there will be no regional newspaper business,\" said one senior newspaper industry executive.</p> <p>The first stage of Montgomery's plan is to merge Northcliffe, the UK's fourth biggest regional newspaper group by circulation, with Iliffe News &amp; Media (the 11th largest), owner of titles such as the Cambridge Evening News, into a venture called Local World. DMGT and Iliffe will control almost half of the venture, with Trinity Mirror also in talks about taking a stake.</p> <p>Montgomery has backers lined up including hedge fund manager Crispin Odey and is also talking to former Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft about a stake.</p> <p>Montgomery will have the benefit of not having to deal with Northcliffe's pension deficit \u2014 DMGT is taking responsibility. The company deficit stood at \u00a3370m at 1 April, although how much of that relates to Northcliffe is unknown. Pension issues have hampered previous negotiations between major players about regional newspaper consolidation.</p> <p>Local World will also not own any printing plants, saving it from the considerable associated costs.</p> <p>However, there is scepticism about whether Montgomery, who was ousted in January last year from Mecom, the pan-European newspaper publisher he founded, is the shining knight with the masterplan that the industry has been waiting for.</p> <p>Journalists who remember Montgomery's time at the Mirror titles in the 1990s, when he had a reputation as a brutal cost cutter, may shudder at the thought of his return to UK newspapers.</p> <p>\"It is not a particularly compelling business; the combination will still leave them fourth in the pecking order of regional newspaper groups,\" said a former senior newspaper executive.</p> <p>\"Montgomery knows the regional business and it unequivocally needs to be done, but after Mirror Group and Mecom I'm surprised it is him and not an existing big player starting this.\"</p> <p>The big player most fancied to have done so is Trinity Mirror, the biggest UK publisher with regional titles including the Liverpool Echo and Newcastle Journal, which has spotted the potential of Local World. Trinity is negotiating to take a stake, thought to be less than 20%, but will not at this point be merging its titles into Local World.</p> <p>\"It is not possible to reverse the structural change in the industry but it is possible to start to develop a business much more appropriate with dealing with it,\" said one source. \"Local publishers tend not to recognise the value of what they have, who else has the infrastructure to collect local content and exploit it? They just don't seem to have got off first base in the digital world. Consolidation can give a new lease of life if savings are invested in modernisation.\"Putting Trinity Mirror's 100-plus titles into Local World would create a super-player much better able to cope with the digital challenge. One analyst compared such a super-merger to the regional newspaper equivalent of the joint venture between book publishers Penguin and Random House, a move designed to try to keep pace with digital upstarts such as Amazon.</p> <p>The critical question is whether the tough stance taken by competition regulators will finally soften in light of the parlous state of the regional market.</p> <p>One observer points out that Montgomery will be keenly watching the outcome of the Competition Commission's investigation into Global Radio's takeover of GMG Radio. That deal brings together the biggest and third biggest players in the UK radio market, and has been struck in the face of many of the same issues facing regional newspapers.</p> <p>\"How the regulator views local market competition will be make or break for whether Montgomery can really lead consolidation \u2013 the radio ruling will be the test for Local World's plans,\" said one source. \"The idea that local publishers restrict and control media content in the internet age is ridiculous. Montgomery has no plan if regulators don't acknowledge this.\"</p>",

  "<p>America experienced a moment last week when forecast became fact; shockingly, concretely. Tomorrow, the same thing will happen. A speculative river will solidify into a hard fact. Whether it is the trajectory of the \"super storm\" Sandy, or the outcome of the presidential election, recent US media discourse has been dominated by forecasts, forecasting and those who make and disseminate them.</p> <p>Informed judgment, or speculation as it is less flatteringly known, has formed a key component of reporting for as long as the practice itself. The faulty forecast has become the dry rot in the flimsy framework of public trust in journalism. Failures to adequately anticipate phenomena, from al-Qaida's rise to the financial system's collapse, have contributed to an erosion of credibility. The \"bendy tree\" journalism of wind-blown TV news reporters has too often misled audiences about the threat of weather systems; the charts say one thing, the man in the Berghaus clinging to a lamppost another.</p> <p>As with every other branch of journalism, the dynamics of reporting \"what will happen\" are shifting from the qualitative model of expert opinion to the quantitative model of what can be extrapolated from measurement. One of the astonishing aspects of Sandy was how accurate the forecasts often were; foreseeing, for example, its move offshore before landing, as predicted, smack in the middle of New Jersey's shoreline.</p> <p>Thorough reporting soon followed, as a torrent of social media updates and photos tumbled into the stream of innovative efforts by big media. The rapid, sketchy information, false rumours and photos made some kind of sense of the scattered chaos. We watched, with timelines, maps and commentary, journalism get better before our very eyes.</p> <p>In a real storm, it seems the media can pull together, and make use of the streams and technologies which arrived to disrupt it. In US political forecasting, however, punditry has created its own fake storm, centring on the predictive powers of one man, Nate Silver. Silver's FiveThirtyEight blog makes his voice one of the most listened-to in US politics. But Silver didn't develop his journalism through the traditional Harvard Crimson and Washington Post route, wearing out shoe leather on the campaign trail and drinking in Capitol Hill bars with interns and advisers. He has a background in economics and started his career modelling baseball statistics. His prediction modelling for the 2008 election gave him remarkable accuracy and elevated his blog to a sought-after source of political wisdom. A deal with the New York Times sealed his rise.</p> <p>His prominence has unsettled those he disrupts, and the possibility that he might be wrong encouraged the sceptics into open hostility. In his new book The Signal and the Noise, Silver lays bare how political pundits failed to predict accurately the scale of the Obama victory. Joe Scarborough, a commentator for MSNBC, and a former Republican congressman, levelled his guns at Silver last week, saying that he was an \"ideologue\", a far more insulting term in US journalism than in British, and that the election was in effect a \"coin toss\".</p> <p>At its most basic level, this argument goes beyond left and right \u2013 it is about a new emerging school of journalism challenging the status quo. Journalism delivered through lovely prose and burnished anecdote, developed through access traded, sometimes for truth, is under threat from spreadsheets and the numeracy of a different elite. All journalism in one way or another is about the performance of information; presenting, polishing, contextualising and reporting. Silver's performance is through numbers and methodology; those left outside it attack it, without acknowledging this might be a world where both can thrive.</p> <p>As of Friday Silver had Obama at an 81% likelihood of winning the election. The polls themselves, it seems, were disrupted by the politics of Sandy. And this was something no one predicted.</p>",
  "<p>Local authorities in London are preparing to send thousands of homeless families to live in temporary homes outside the capital, in defiance of ministerial demands that people should continue to be housed locally.</p> <p>Councils are acquiring properties in Kent, Essex, Hertfordshire, Berkshire, Sussex and further afield to cope with an expected surge in numbers of vulnerable families presenting as homeless as a result of welfare cuts from next April.</p> <p>They say rising rents in London coupled with the introduction next April of stringent benefit caps leave them in an impossible position, with no option but to initiate an outflow of poorer families from the capital by placing homeless households in cheaper areas, often many miles from their home borough. Draft guidance issued by ministers in May says councils must \"as far as is reasonably practicable\" offer accommodation for homeless families within the borough.</p> <p>This was ordered by the then housing minister, Grant Shapps, after <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/newham-council-accused-of-social-cleansing-after-attempts-to-move-poorest-families-7674939.html\" title=\"\">reports that Newham council planned to relocate households to Stoke-on-Trent</a>, a proposal Shapps, now Conservative party chairman, described as \"unfair and wrong\".</p> <p>Guardian research shows London councils have acquired rental properties in Luton, Northampton, Broxbourne, Gravesend, Dartford, Slough, Windsor, Margate, Hastings, Epping Forest, Thurrock and Basildon, and are considering accommodation as far away as Manchester, Hull, Derby, Nottingham, Birmingham and Merthyr Tydfil in south Wales.</p> <p>Councils said the move was inevitable because there was virtually no suitable private rented temporary accommodation for larger families in London that was affordable within government-imposed housing benefit allowances, which are capped at \u00a3400 a week.</p> <p>\"It is going to be practically impossible to provide affordable accommodation to meet our homelessness duties in London,\" said Ken Jones, director of housing and strategy at Barking and Dagenham council, east London. \"As the pressures increase we will be looking to procure well out of London, and even out of the home counties.\"</p> <p>All but four of the 33 London local authorities responded to the Guardian survey. Seventeen said they were already placing homeless families outside the capital, or had secured or were considering temporary accommodation outside London for future use. These included Kensington and Chelsea, which has moved a minority of homeless families to Manchester and Slough; Waltham Forest, which has acquired housing in Luton, Margate and Harlow; Brent, which has relocated some households to Hastings; and Tower Hamlets, which has relocated a handful of families to Northampton.</p> <p>Councils expect a wave of legal challenges from homeless residents who will cite <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/housing/pdf/21513539.pdf\" title=\"\">government guidance</a> to argue that their offer of accommodation outside the capital is \"unsuitable\" because of the impact on their health or their children's education, according to a <a href=\"http://www.cpag.org.uk/content/between-rock-and-hard-place-early-impacts-welfare-reform-london\">new study</a> published by the charity <a href=\"http://www.cpag.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Child Poverty Action Group</a> (CPAG) and <a href=\"http://www.lasa.org.uk/\">Lasa</a>.</p> <p>The CPAG report warns that thousands of homeless families already placed in expensive temporary accommodation in the capital face being uprooted for a second time. Councils could face the choice of picking up the bill for the rent shortfall for these households \u2013 expected to run to tens of millions of pounds a year \u2013 or moving the families to cheaper homes outside the capital.</p> <p>Alison Garnham, CPAG chief executive, said: \"Families are facing the impossible situation of being told to move to cheaper accommodation that just doesn't exist with London's rising rents. London boroughs are staring at a black hole in their budgets as a result, with costs transferred from central to local government.</p> <p>\"There's still time for government to do the sensible thing and think again when these reforms are debated in parliament before thousands of London's families find themselves uprooted, overcrowded and thrown into turmoil.\"</p> <p>MPs are expected to debate regulations that will set detail how the benefit cap will work at <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/calendar/#!/calendar/Commons/GeneralCommittee/2012/11/6/events.html\" title=\"\">a Commons legislation committee meeting</a> on Tuesday.</p> <p>Government guidance states: \"Homeless households may not always be able to stay in their previous neighbourhoods. However, the government considers that it is not acceptable for local authorities to make compulsory placements automatically hundreds of miles away, without having proper regard for the disruption this may cause to those households.\"</p> <p>The CPAG report, based on detailed interviews with 11 London local authorities, also found many working households would also face substantial income shortfalls as a result of housing benefit caps. Councils say families are reluctant to move if this would disrupt their children's schooling or cut them off from relatives and friends, causing fears of a surge in overcrowding as families improvise by sharing properties or trade down to smaller flats.</p> <p>Although it had been anticipated that affordable private rents in expensive inner city areas such as Westminster would be scarce, the acute housing shortage in the capital means market rents outstrip benefit cap levels in cheaper outer London boroughs including Haringey, Waltham Forest, and Barking and Dagenham.</p> <p>Families have already begun to move from inner London to outer boroughs, with more expected from this month as transitional support for families affected by the housing benefit caps runs out. The government had hoped the housing benefit reforms would force landlords to reduce rents to within cap limits.</p> <p>But councils say the demand for private rented property from tenants priced out of the housing market means most landlords see no reason to drop rents, and a substantial number say they will no longer consider renting to people who are claiming housing benefit.</p> <p>Some councils have estimated that up to a third of families affected by the introduction of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/benefit-cap\" title=\"\">\u00a326,000 benefit cap</a>, the <a href=\"http://england.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/housing_benefit_and_local_housing_allowance/changes_to_local_housing_allowance\" title=\"\">local housing allowance cap</a> and <a href=\"http://www.housing.org.uk/policy/welfare_reform/%E2%80%98under-occupation%E2%80%99_penalty.aspx\" title=\"\">under-occupation penalties</a>, known as the \"spare room tax\", will lose about \u00a3100 a week. They face the options of finding more income, moving into cheaper accommodation or presenting to the local authority as homeless. Most authorities have attempted to identify and advise residents at risk of losing income as a result of welfare changes. But there is acceptance among officials that many of the families affected will have few options.</p> <p>One cabinet member for housing in an inner city borough said: \"Let's face it, a lot of people with more than two or three children, and who are dependent on benefits in this borough are not going to be here for very much longer.\"</p> <p>Although ministers have introduced a \u00a3165m discretionary housing fund for London councils in 2013-14 to help families who can make a special case for staying, the CPAG report says this is inadequate and amounts to less than 10% of the shortfall in benefit income caused by changes.</p> <p>Councils say some of the households that will be hit by the benefit cap have also been identified by them as needing support under the \"troubled families\" scheme. But they fear a public backlash if they prioritise them for discretionary housing payments because this would signal that \"problematic behaviour was being rewarded\".</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \"It is neither acceptable, fair nor necessary for local authorities to place families far away from their area. The law is already clear that local authorities must secure accommodation within their own borough so far as reasonably practicable, and new rules will reinforce this.</p> <p>\"Our reforms restore fairness to a system that was allowed to spiral out of control under the previous government. It's not right that some families living on benefits should be able to live in areas of London that hard-working families could simply never afford to stay in.\"</p> <p><em>Additional research by Irene Baque </em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 15 October 2012.

  "<p>Alyona Korolyova thought she had seen everything \u2013 the lifting of Russia's ban on homosexuality after the Soviet Union fell, the slow appearance of mainstream gay clubs, and even, once, a young gay couple on a TV sitcom.</p> <p>Then last week, Korolyova, 48, was forced to stand pressed against the wall of a gay-friendly club and watch as a group of burly men, their faces hidden with surgical masks, repeatedly kicked her girlfriend in the head as part of an organised attack.</p> <p>\"I never thought I would live to see this,\" Korolyova said. \"It was like a movie, a nightmare.\"</p> <p>The attack on 7freedays, a club in central Moscow, has heightened fears among gay rights activists that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/12/st-petersburg-bans-homosexual-propaganda\" title=\"\">new laws targeting \"homosexual propaganda\"</a> in cities around Russia have created an atmosphere where discrimination \u2013 and violence \u2013 against gay people is now tolerated.</p> <p>\"The authorities have given a command \u2013 that such attacks will not be punished, that we are a group to be hated,\" Korolyova said.</p> <p>The incident took place last week during a celebration of the internationally observed National Coming Out Day. Despite the club's serpentine hallways, the men knew which room to run to, and divided up in planned formation, patrons said.</p> <p>\"At around 9.30pm, a group of masked men ran by me, yelled: 'This fight has been ordered' and began overturning tables, throwing chairs and beating whomever fell under their hands,\" Andrei Obolensky said. The attack lasted five minutes. Four people \u2013 three women and one man \u2013 were treated in hospital and at least a dozen left with cuts and bruises.</p> <p>The attack is one of several to have been reported since Russian cities began adopting the laws amid a wider government initiative to push for ultraconservative policies. Discrimination is even more widespread. Gay pride marches are regularly banned in Russia and this summer, Moscow's highest court banned gay pride parades in the capital for 100 years.</p> <p>Eight Russian regions have banned so-called \"homosexual propaganda\" in the past year \u2013 Arkhangelsk, Ryazan, Kostroma, Magadan, Novosibirsk, Krasnodar, Bashkortostan and, most controversially, St Petersburg, Russia's second city and its cultural capital.</p> <p>A bill on a national ban has been submitted to the Duma, the Russian parliament.</p> <p>Igor Kochatkev, the head of LGBT Network, a St Petersburg-based gay rights advocacy, said: \"Of course there is a link \u2013 we see that whenever such laws on propaganda are adopted, or even discussed, then the activism of violent groups increases.\"</p> <p>The day after the law was adopted in St Petersburg in March, a group of men attacked one of its most popular gay clubs, Malevich. Similar attacks were recorded in the city in May and June, according to LGBT Network.</p> <p>The attack on 7freedays came a day after People's Council, a nationalist group, called on authorities in Moscow to ban \"homosexual propaganda\".</p> <p>Oleg Kassin, a member of the group, denied any link to the attack. \"We don't go down the path of violence,\" he said. \"Only the path of law. We are working to create a necessary legal basis, the necessary laws.\" He accused LGBT activists of organising the attack themselves to raise their profile.</p> <p>Kassin said People's Council, an anti-immigrant pro-church group, worked with \"friendly deputies\" to push for the passage of anti-gay laws. One such deputy is Vitaly Milonov, an outspoken and religious MP in the St Petersburg legislature who has become the face of Russia's anti-gay movement.</p> <p>He has supported charging Madonna with promoting \"homosexual propaganda\" after an August concert in St Petersburg where she spoke out in support of gay rights. A city court has demanded the pop star appears for a hearing into the charges \u2013 she has not responded.</p> <p>\"Homosexuality is a sickness. It must be treated like a tooth that hurts,\" said Milonov, who put forward the St Petersburg law this year.</p> <p>According to the Levada Centre, an independent pollster, many Russians agree. A poll taken in July found 32% of Russians saw homosexuality as \"a sickness or the result of a psychological trauma\" \u2013 43% saw it as \"debauchery or a bad habit\".</p> <p>Milonov plays to those views, while pushing for the interests of Russia's Orthodox Christians.</p> <p>It is no wonder gay rights activists feel threatened. \"We see these new laws being adopted,\" said Obolensky, \"and then many clerical representatives and nationalists say that LGBT people are sick and need to be healed. This raises the level of intolerance in society\".</p> <p>Korolyova, who was in the Moscow club at the time of the attack, said that she would not change her behaviour: \"We will not go underground. We will not hide.\"</p>",
  "<p>Brendan Rodgers's post-match verdict was again a litany of \"if onlys\". If only Liverpool had marksmen to add penetration to possession football they would not be languishing 12th in the Premier League after 10 matches. If only Luis Su\u00e1rez was not the one guaranteed source of goals and the narrative behind every Liverpool performance they could \"fly\". The reality is far less compelling.</p> <p>The imponderable it paid the Liverpool manager to ignore against Newcastle United was the state his team would be in had Fabricio Coloccini embedded his studs into Su\u00e1rez's right knee with six minutes remaining. Coloccini was shown a merited straight red card, to the obvious disgust of his manager Alan Pardew, but Su\u00e1rez survived and continued to present Liverpool's only threat even with a limp.</p> <p>Rodgers described the Liverpool performance as \"outstanding\" after they recovered from Yohan Cabaye's first-half strike. The analysis applied to Su\u00e1rez alone following another mesmerising individual display but one that could not give Rodgers a better points return after 10 league matches than Roy Hodgson achieved.</p> <p>The contrast in Liverpool's performance level between Rodgers and Hodgson is night and day but the frustration is all-too familiar. Newcastle lost three key players to injury during the game but only a lapse in concentration denied them a first win at Anfield since 1994.</p> <p>Steven Gerrard was presented with an ornamental Liver bird in recognition of his 600th appearance for Liverpool before kick off, the captain becoming only the 10th player in the club's history to reach that impressive milestone.On hand for the presentation was Gerrard's former mentor in Liverpool's central midfield, Gary McAllister, and how Rodgers could do with the vision, command and experience the Scot brought to G\u00e9rard Houllier's team.</p> <p>The first half encapsulated Liverpool's recent home performances and the struggle facing Rodgers as he tries to implement a new style without all the necessary components in place. January cannot come quickly enough in the manager's quest for new strikers. Liverpool began brightly with the movement of Su\u00e1rez and Raheem Sterling stretching Newcastle and Gerrard prepared to shoot on sight. But too often, usually in the absence of a finishing touch from the relentless Su\u00e1rez, Liverpool have mastered the art of looking good without hurting their opponent and for 67 minutes Pardew's team were no exception.</p> <p>Newcastle toiled in those opening exchanges and the suspended Cheik Tiot\u00e9 was sorely missed as Liverpool found space behind the visiting midfield time and again. Coloccini commenced his exhausting afternoon of trying to keep Su\u00e1rez in check with an important interception at his near post and Suso had two efforts deflected wide having cut in from the right.</p> <p>Hatem Ben Arfa and Papiss Ciss\u00e9 gave scant protection to their full-backs but, perversely, once James Perch, one of their better performers, limped off with a thigh injury the visitors finally entered the contest. The introduction of Danny Simpson at right back and Vurnon Anita's switch into central midfield brought greater solidity, Liverpool were unable to find Su\u00e1rez so easily and both Newcastle's passing and threat improved. Though it was still a shock to Anfield when Pardew's team took the lead moments before the break.</p> <p>From a foul throw committed by Andre Wisdom, Newcastle broke in devastating style. Ben Arfa escaped the close attention of former team-mate Jos\u00e9 Enrique to reach the line from Demba Ba's pass and crossed perfectly for Cabaye at the back post. The French international had time to control before beating Brad Jones with a clinical finish across goal.</p> <p>Liverpool were re-energised after the interval. Su\u00e1rez and Nuri Sahin both went close with shots on the turn as the home side dominated possession and they finally found a route to goal from an uncharacteristic long ball. Jon\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez sliced a careless pass to Jos\u00e9 Enrique and the Liverpool left-back launched a first time ball over the Newcastle defence. Su\u00e1rez, having escaped Coloccini once more, controlled superbly on his shoulder, rounded Tim Krul and rolled the ball into an empty net.</p> <p>Sterling should have added a second when sent through on goal by Su\u00e1rez only for a moment's hesitation to allow Steven Taylor to make an excellent block. Su\u00e1rez also set up Jonjo Shelvey for a decent chance that the substitute could only roll at Krul before Coloccini collected a straight red card for a dangerous foul on his Liverpool nemesis. The ball had long gone from Su\u00e1rez when the Argentina defender arrived late, over the ball and raked the striker's calf with his studs. Referee Anthony Taylor had little option but to dismiss the defender for a foul reminiscent of one Su\u00e1rez inflicted on Sylvain Distin in the Merseyside derby last Sunday.</p> <p>A stoppage time free-kick from Su\u00e1rez bounced over Krul and onto the Newcastle bar and, for all their second half pressure, a winner was beyond Liverpool. But at least they have still have Su\u00e1rez.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Hello.</strong> How appropriate that after a week of goals, the weekend should end with the fixture that invented the 4-3 scoreline. Yet sadly, there appears little prospect of Liverpool and Newcastle rolling back the years this afternoon and slugging out a seven-goal thriller as they did so memorably in 1996 and 1997. The 'This is Anfield' sign in the tunnel is supposed to make the visitors shudder, but now the sight of it is making Liverpool queasy too. They have won just once here in the league this season and a mere three times overall in the league in 2012; on Wednesday, Swansea City pitched up in the League Cup and made off with a 3-1 win against the holders. Brendan Rodgers speaks a lot about the \"journey\" his players are on. So far, it looks decidedly rocky. Liverpool are 13th in the table, although a win this afternoon would actually leave them four points off the top four. See, there's some of the \"helicopter vision\" Rodgers has been wittering on about this week. </p> <p>Liverpool's problems largely lie in the goalscoring department, even though they should have had three at Everton last week. While they put five past Norwich at Carrow Road, at Anfield they have only managed to score more than one goal in a match once, against Manchester City in August. There's been plenty of pretty passing, as is the Brendan Way, but it has rarely been backed up by decisive finishing, Luis Suarez too often guilty of a wayward touch in front of goal. But then, he is expected to do it alone; Fabio Borini's injured, Andy Carroll's living it up in London and Clint Dempsey plays for Tottenham. They probably could have done with Brendan's Chopper Vision in August.</p> <p>Luckily Newcastle have a worse record at Anfield than Liverpool do. They haven't won at Liverpool since a 2-0 win in 1994 \u2013 goals from Andy Cole and Rob Lee since you ask \u2013 and have only picked up a couple of draws here and there since then. What's more, they're yet to win an away game this season and have not been as impressive as they were last season, perhaps a consequence of an unproductive transfer market and the demands of Thursday nights on Channel Five. Even so, Rodgers surely won't be able to steal a few jealous glances at some of the talent in Alan Pardew's line-up: Demba Ba, Hatem Ben Arfa, Yohan Cabaye, Papiss Cisse and Cheik Tiote were all secured for a snip. Now that's Moneyball.</p> <p><strong>Liverpool, who are unchanged from the draw with Everton:</strong> Jones; Wisdom, Skrtel, Agger, Jose Enrique; Gerrard, Allen, Sahin; Suso, Suarez, Sterling. <strong>Subs:</strong> Gulacsi, Assaidi, Henderson, Coates, Downing, Carragher, Shelvey.</p> <p><strong>Newcastle, boosted by a fit Demba Ba:</strong> Krul; Anita, Steven Taylor, Coloccini, Santon; Perch, Cabaye, Gutierrez; Ben Arfa, Cisse, Ba. <strong>Subs:</strong> Harper, Simpson, Williamson, Shola Ameobi, Obertan, Sammy Ameobi,<br>Ferguson.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Anthony Taylor (Cheshire) </p> <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 4pm.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>With all this talk of helicopters, it's a surprise Rodgers didn't sign Michael Owen, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD-LjX_K9Cg\">who is a trained helicopter pilot</a>.</strong> Or Les Ferdinand. Or land on the pitch in one in Kevin Keegan style.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>It has been noted that Brendan \"Brentan\" Rodgers bears a striking resemblance to David Brent in Being: Liverpool.</strong> So here is today's challenge: change scenes from The Office to incorporate Liverpool. For example.</p> <p><strong>Brentan:</strong> What's your name?<br><strong>Suso:</strong> Suso.<br><strong>Brentan:</strong> What's your real name?<br><strong>Suso:</strong> Jes\u00fas Joaqu\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez S\u00e1ez de la Torre.<br><strong>Brentan:</strong> That's a good name!<br><strong>Suso:</strong> Is it?<br><strong>Brentan:</strong> Yes!</p> <p><strong>Brentan:</strong> Jamie, under weaknesses you've put \"football\".<br><strong>Jamie:</strong> Yep.</p> <p><strong>Brentan:</strong> Sometimes my nines will be false.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>An email.</strong> \"Let The David Brent-Off begin!\" says Adam Hirst. \"A fascinating battle between two decent managers who believe their own publicity more than any other in British football... save only Sam Allardyce.\"</p> <p>\"I appreciate that this game hasn't kicked off yet, but I'm still mildly disappointed that there haven't been any goals so far,\" says Ethan Dean-Richards. \"Remember in the old days, under Keegan, when games would start with both teams having already scored at least twice? It was a simpler time, but also a better one.\"</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Here come The Teams.</strong> Please be upstanding for The Teams. Do Liverpool fans have horrible flashbacks to the Paul Konchesky Era when they see Jose Enrique's newly-shaved head?</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Off we go.</strong> Newcastle, kicking from left to right, attacking The Kop in the first half, get us going. They keep the ball for roughly 20 seconds, handing it to Liverpool with an agricultural hoof forward. The Anfield Hoodoo is overwhelming them already.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> Gerrard, making his 600th appearance for Liverpool, looks to mark it with a stunner from 35 yards out. No dice. The ball spins over to the left for Sterling, who's unceremoniously left on the floor by Anita. A free-kick for Liverpool in a promising position then.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Gerrard fizzes the ball into the six-yard box, forcing Krul to punch it away. But this is an excellent start from Liverpool, and especially Sterling. He links up well with Sahin on the left, breaking in behind Anita again and compelling Coloccini to turn the ball behind for a corner that comes to nothing. Here's Joseph Temple's offering. \"Love Liverpool and Suarez, but the scene with Brent's new PA came to mind:</p> <p><em>Brentan and Suarez are messing about with a ball in the offices of Melwood when he's signing his new contract. Brentan lunges in, and Luis goes down.</em></p> <p><strong>Brentan:</strong> That's a man's game, that is.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Newcastle are being pinned back here. Suarez skedaddles into the area and goes down under a strong challenge. The home fans cry for a penalty but Anthony Taylor waves play on.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> Liverpool are having joy down both flanks. Suso slips a lovely pass in behind Suso, but the ball bobbles up as Wisdom crosses and flies over for a goal-kick. Now then, a replay of the Suarez incident reveals that he was caught by Coloccini. It wasn't blatant but it could easily have been given. \"Would it be fair to say that Joe Allen is very much the Gareth Keenan and Steven Gerrard the Chris Finch?\" asks Tom Trevelyan.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> Suso cuts in from the right and sees a low skidder deflected wide for a corner on the left. Newcastle have barely been out of their half yet. Krul claws Gerrard's corner behind with some difficulty but Sahin's delivery is easily dealt with by Ba. Here's David Flynn:</p> <p><strong>Brentan:</strong> If you asked me would I like my teams to be functional and solid or entertaining and ropey, I would say, why can't they be both?</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> There are Newcastle players in the Liverpool half. But Liverpool have the ball.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> Sterling finds space in front of the Newcastle defence but his subsequent effort from long range is well wide. It's all Liverpool though. They've been very bright. Newcastle are playing as if they have some terrible record on their minds.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> Newcastle have just gone and strung four or five passes together. Hurrah! It ends with Perch sweeping a pass out for a goal-kick. Small steps. \"Is it too late for an Act of Parliament to be passed forbidding the sale of British football clubs to Americans along the lines that requires artistic 'national treasures' to remain British,\" says Lou Roper? \"The sight of the names 'Downing' and Henderson' among the substitutes (on the other might be another Act encouraging foreign buyers for certain British footballers if they remove them from Britain) provides a(nother) reminder that alleged knowledge of sport by American 'sport tycoons', such as the Fenway Group, translates, at best, to nowt in the football (as played with, you know, feet) scene.\"</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> Has anyone been calling this the Andy Carroll Derby?</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Newcastle are coming into this now. Santon scampers down the left and finds Ba to his right. He takes a touch and then larrumps one miles over the bar. Anfield is very quiet.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> A lull. Plenty of midfield sparring, without much of a punch in the final third so far.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> Now Newcastle threaten. Ben Arfa slices Liverpool open on the left with a pass inside Wisdom for Santon to chase. He gets to the byline and cuts back on to his right foot, before curling in a cross that's just too high for Cisse to do anything notable with. The ball comes back to Anita on the right, but his centre is a waste of time. Liverpool will surely be concerned with how easily they were taken apart there though.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> After some midfield harum-scarum, the ball breaks kindly for Liverpool to counter. Just as Suarez prepares to shoot from 25 yards out, just to the right, Perch halts him illegally.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Suarez, who scored a free-kick against Manchester City from a similar position this season, takes this one and bends it round the wall and just past the angle of post and bar. Tim Krul didn't move. The ball brushed the netting on its way into the crowd. Close. Maybe that will help Liverpool regain some of the fluency they showed in the first 10 minutes. Up the other end, Ben Arfa makes space for the shot but drags it wide from 25 yards out.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Suso sends Suarez away down the right, one-on-one with Taylor. Suarez runs at the backtracking defender and then shifts the ball to the right before drilling a low shot that Krul blocks with his feet. \"If you were to ask me to name three great players, I probably wouldn't say Maradona, Pele,\" says Stuart Jenkinson.\"I'd go Shelvey, Jones, Enrique....Downing.\"</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> Suarez causes more havoc in the Newcastle area with a zigzagging run. He eventually loses the ball trying to do much before Allen arrives on the scene trying to make something of it, only to send the ball behind for a goal-kick. It's encouraging for Liverpool though, even if there is a discernible lack of conviction in the final third. James Stenson emails:</p> <p><strong>Brentan:</strong> Team playing-I call it team individuality, it's a new, it's like a management style. Again guilty, unorthodox, sue me.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Newcastle have a problem with James Perch who is off receiving treatment. If he does have to be replaced, Danny Simpson will probably come on and move to right-back, with Anita going into midfield.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> Perch is moving very gingerly indeed. He's surely going to come off.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Indeed he does: Perch goes off, Danny Simpson comes on. Here's Brad McMillan.</p> <p><strong>Brentan:</strong> I don't live by \"The Rules\" you know, and if there's one person who has influenced me in that way of thinking, someone who is a maverick, someone who does 'that' to the system then it's Tony Adams.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Steven Gerrard, assistant to the Liverpool manager, hasn't done a lot on his 600th appearance.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> Gerrard drifts a high ball to the far post, where Suarez gets above Taylor to send a harmless header wide. This isn't going to end 4-3, is it.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>31 min:</strong> It's so flat inside Anfield. The home fans really need something to lift them. They've seen this match before. They saw it on Wednesday night, I fancy. \"Aside from the arrogant blundering that left us with just one striker (if we can call Suarez a striker) at an age where he can be licensed to drive a car on his own, how have Liverpool managed to find themselves unable to call on a proper goalkeeper or a proper ball-winner in midfield?\" wonders Lou Roper.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Martin Skrtel appears to have displaced a contact lens. It's that exciting. It does mean he won't get the benefit of helicopter vision.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> Suarez takes on three Newcastle defenders and pulls the ball into the area. Number of Liverpool players who had bothered joining him in the attack: 0. This match is frustrating.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> \"Ricky Gervais has said many times that his favourite scene in The Office is the \"I think there's been a rape up there!\" one,\" says Nick Hartman. \"What's yours? Mine would probably have to be the<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Itgyy2CBiso\"> Black Man's C0ck Joke</a>, which is rather coincidental considering that uh, well, um...\" Probably when Brent gets his guitar out.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>38 min:</strong> There's a growing suspicion that Papiss Cisse is a bit rubbish when he's not shooting.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> Steven Gerrard can do what he wants because it's his 600th appearance. Which means he can definitely channel the memory of Xabi Alonso and try to score with a free-kick from inside his own half. Oh Steven! Such ambition! Such helicopter vision! On the touchline Steve Harper, the victim of one such Alonso jape in 2006, has a wee chuckle.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> Suso again diddles in from the right, moving ominously on to his left foot, and sees his shot from 12 yards out deflected wide. The resulting corner comes out as far as Suso on the edge of the area. His volley is wild. Thomas Flynn again:</p> <p><strong>Brentan:</strong> I've sort of fused Barcelona with Wigan Athletic shit.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>WHAT A GOAL! Liverpool 0-1 Newcastle (Cabaye, 43 min):</strong> Newcastle take the lead with their first real shot. But what a shot it is. Liverpool have dominated this half, but now they're behind. The same old story. For the first time in the half, Ben Arfa was able to run dangerously at Enrique. He twisted this way and that, before slithering to the byline. His chipped cross evaded Ba and Cisse in the middle but no one had bothered to notice Cabaye at the far post. He took a touch and then battered a vicious volley past Jones and into the top corner.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> The mood around Anfield darkens as Gerrard plays a slack pass straight to Cabaye in his own half. He could play Ba in but buoyed by his stunner, he goes for goal again from long range. It's not too far off. In the crowd, the locals are using language of the industrial variety.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>45 min+1:</strong> Suarez takes down a high ball, turns and sends a dismal volley shamefully wide from 25 yards out.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>45 min+3:</strong> Liverpool are all over the shop now. Failure to clear a harmless free-kick on the edge of their own area ends with a Newcastle player - I'm not sure who - curling a snapshot wide. There's anger in the stands.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>Half time: Liverpool 0-1 Newcastle.</strong> Newcastle have the lead at the break at Anfield for the first time since May 2004. They didn't win then but unless there's a marked improvement from Liverpool in the second half, they will this time. As the players walk off, Suarez has a natter at the officials, as is his way. He'd be better off asking Brendan Rodgers to provide him with a partner up front.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>Half time emails.</strong></p> <p>\"If Sam Allardyce is reading this mbm, I wonder whether he is fuming that a Brent-off is taking place without him or does he secretly see himself as Finchy?\" says Dave Evans.</p> <p>\"I really had hopes that we'd formed some sort of team unity and identity but on that first half we seem as disjointed and utterly on different wavelengths as I've seen us,\" says Paul Quigley. \"Beginning to have doubts that brendon can do this. The lack of sacrifice for one another and making easy options to pass to is completely devoid. What do you think?\" I think they need a striker.</p> <p>\"When important people come to my house, see the self-portrait I've got hanging, they think 'here's someone to be taken seriously.',\" says Stephen Mitchell. \"But when everyday commoner types come over, they see it and know that I'm actually just having a laugh at myself, never taking myself too seriously. But it works both ways, and that's what's so brilliant about it!\"</p> <p>\"Ever noticed how much Luis Suarez resembles the American novelist <a href=\" http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2011/10/your-best-friend-calls-you-and-tells-you-heshes-really-sick-how-do-you-show-you-care-1.html\">Thomas Pynchon</a>?\" says Theo Finigan. </p> <p>\"Can't help but feel Liverpool might benefit from giving Suarez perhaps a tiny bit of support,\" says Richard South. \"Maybe having someone within 40 yards of him when he's in Newcastle's penalty area with the ball at his feet might help us look at little more threatening. Just a thought.\"</p> <p>Here's Lou Roper: <strong>Brentan:</strong> For me, it's all about living the dream: the team individualitiness generated by my system of ball-playing where we don't actually need to bother to get the ball or to do anything with it if you happen to have it.</p> <p>Here's Peter Oh: <strong>Brentan:</strong> When people say to me: would you rather be thought of as a funny man or a great boss? My answer's always the same, to me, Downing has got the qualities to play at left back.</p> <p>Here's James Stenson: <strong>Brentan:</strong> You know which \"philosopher\" said that? Ian Ayre..... And people say he's just a big pair of tits.</p> <p>Here's Niall McVeigh: <strong>At half time, to Pardew, Brentan:</strong> \"Name anything you want, and Agger will throw it over the Kop.

He'd say [Gives the bird] \"Do it yourself i've got to sign some strikers !!!\"</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>You could not make this up.</strong> A malevolent and malfunctioning sprinkler has just turned its ire on a section of Liverpool fans. A drenched man stands there, arms outstretched, an irate look all over his fizzog. A new indignity.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> Here we go again. Liverpool are going to have to do something thoroughly out of character and score a goal. \"Gerrard is playing worse than Andre Santos,\" says Sasu Laaksonen. \"Fact.\" Let's not go that far.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Ba has headed every corner from the right away.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> This is better from Liverpool. On the left, Suarez and Sterling work a short corner routine but Suarez is blocked off before he can shoot. Gerrard then tries to make inroads on the left, only to overrun the ball.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> Demba Ba, who was an injury doubt before the game, is replaced by Sammy Ameobi. Before he goes off, he gives his gloves to Ben Arfa. Is there a shortage of gloves at Newcastle or something?</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> Cisse is crunched by Sterling. The referee shows leniency though and lets him off without a booking.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Get Downing on.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> There's no real sign that Liverpool have a clue how to get the equaliser.

Here's James Stenson's latest.</p> <p><strong>Brentan:</strong> When Charlie Adam came he could barely speak English and I took him under my wing. It was a proud moment when he asked me to be his firstborn sons godfather. We had to let him go in the end. He was useless... Useless</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> With more than half an hour left, Krul is wasting time over a free-kick.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> Jose Enrique gets away with two clear fouls on two Newcastle players on the left, which allows Suarez to wriggle clear on the edge of the area and shoot, drawing a good save from Krul, pushing the ball wide for Liverpool's ninth corner. And for the ninth time, Newcastle deal with it with the minimum fuss.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> Suarez slips a pass into Sahin's feet in the area. He turns swiftly but his low bobbler bounces a couple of yards wide. Liverpool are gradually growing in confidence. Newcastle's defence is getting deeper.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> A rare attack from Newcastle. Sammy Ameobi isolates Skrtel on the left and looks like he has the beating of him as he lopes into the area, only for the defender to produce an inch-perfect tackle. And it had to be, because otherwise it surely would have been a penalty.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> <a href=\"www.101greatgoals.com/blog/gif-lolz-liverpool-fans-get-a-soaking-by-a-rogue-sprinkler-v-newcastle/\">Here's a clip of the Liverpool fans getting soaked</a>.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Sammy Ameobi runs the ball out of play, beating himself with his own quick feet. He walks away, expecting a Liverpool goal-kick. And gets a corner. Eh? From the corner, Skrtel heads it behind. So the referee gives Liverpool a goal-kick.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Suso is replaced by Jonjo Shelvey.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>WHAT A GOAL! Liverpool 1-1 Newcastle (Suarez, 67 min):</strong> Luis Suarez does come up with his moment of magic to drag Liverpool level. This is a sublime goal, although Newcastle will be furious with the way they've let Liverpool back into it because it all came from a loose pass from Gutierrez in midfield. Jose Enrique then hit a long ball over the top for Suarez, who had snuck in between the two Newcastle defenders. He took the ball down brilliantly on his chest, rolled it around Krul and then tapped it into the empty net. What skill!</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Newcastle respond by bringing on Shane Ferguson for their goalscorer, Yohan Cabaye.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> What a miss from Jonjo Shelvey! Suarez, now winning his personal duel with Coloccini, beats the Argentinian in a tussle on the right. He could shoot but instead tees up Shelvey, who was six yards out with the goal gaping - and the midfielder inexplicably toepokes a risible effort straight at Krul. Liverpool can't believe they're not ahead. But this is what Anfield does to Newcastle.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>72 min:</strong> Ben Arfa curls a tame free-kick wide of the right post from 25 yards out. Really, if Newcastle do lose this game, they can't complain. They haven't offered a lot.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> Sterling's drive from 25 yards out is deflected over by Coloccini, who threw himself desperately in front of the ball. Liverpool sense a winner is on the way.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Here comes trouble: Stewart Downing replaces Nuri Sahin.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> Take your time, Raheem. Liverpool break en masse, Suarez leading the charge and with options left and right. For once, he decides to pass and plays in Sterling on the right. He has a clear sight of goaland should score but takes an age to shoot, allowing Taylor to get across and deflect his effort over.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> Disastrous defending from Wisdom offers up a chance to Cisse. He could have let an aimless cross drift behind but presumably didn't get a shout and instead headed the ball straight to Cisse, who swivelled and volleyed weakly wide from 15 yards out.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> \"I take it Gerrard will complain about the long ball tactics used by Liverpool for the equaliser?\" says James Stenson.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> With Liverpool looking for the winner, they're caught short at the back. Ameobi curves a delicious pass from left to right for Ben Arfa, who greedily and wastefully cuts inside before shooting straight at Jones when Cisse was waiting in the centre.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Enrique dinks a cross into the middle where Suarez, all alone, can't rise high enough to head it home. The Enrique-Suarez combination is probably up there with Yorke and Cole.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> The tricky, gangly Ameobi nutmegs one man and then has a dig from 25 yards out, bringing a decent save out of Jones.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> <strong>FABRICIO COLOCCINI IS SENT OFF! NEWCASTLE ARE DOWN TO 10 MEN!</strong> At first I had no idea what this was for, but the replay shows it was a moment of madness from Coloccini. Suarez flicked a pass down the right flank but as he did so, Coloccini steamed in with his boot ludicrously high, catching Suarez on the back of the leg. Dearie me. A straight red and there can be no complaints. Maybe he's not the new Bobby Moore.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Simpson has gone to centre-back, with Anita moving back to right-back.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> A Gerrard free-kick from the right comes all the way to Shelvey at the far post - in a similar position to where Cabaye scored for Newcastle but his sidefooter is straight at Krul.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> What a chance for Shelvey. Downing reaches the byline and serves up a wonderful cross from the left, but Shelvey sends a downward header straight at Krul from six yards out. Either side of the goalkeeper and the points were Liverpool's. That's his second bad miss. I blame Sir Alex Ferguson.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>90 min+1:</strong> There will be four minutes of added time.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>90 min+4:</strong> Liverpool hit the bar! A Suarez free-kick - intended as a cross - is deflected by Cisse, the one man, in the wall. It loops up all the way to Shelvey six yards from goal. He can't make any contact with it but his presence and a horrible bounce deceives Krul ... and hits the bar! It's just not Liverpool's ground.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>Full time: Liverpool 1-1 Newcastle.</strong> And that's it. More frustration at Anfield for Liverpool, who have now won just two of their 10 league games this season. They might have dominated most of this match but even still couldn't overcome a Newcastle side with a terrible record at Anfield. Luis Suarez needs a friend or two up front. He can only do so much alone. Although what he can do is rather special. Thanks for reading. Bye.</p>",
  "<p>Veronica Romero was belting it out for Mitt Romney. Her band, Punto y Coma, flipped between Cuban and Puerto Rican numbers for a crowd of Republican supporters in Kissimmee, a central Florida town next to Disneyworld where a surge in Hispanic residents since the last presidential election is shaking up old assumptions about the Latino vote in an important swing state.</p> <p>The Cuban songs played to a community that has for decades defined Latino politics in Florida as solidly pro-Republican. The Puerto Rican music was an acknowledgement that hegemony is increasingly under challenge from Latino migrants whose votes are up for grabs.</p> <p>Romero is Puerto Rican and for Romney. But when she talks about the election she sounds much like a Barack Obama supporter four years ago.</p> <p>\"We are tired of the same old. We are looking forward,\" she said. \"We were looking for a change and we didn't get it. Especially the economy. We need more job opportunities. We are looking to work.\"</p> <p>Opinion polls show Obama commanding a sizeable lead among Latino voters across the US who support him about two to one against Romney. But Florida is different.</p> <p>The bulk of the Hispanic population in US border states to the west has Mexican roots. Florida's Latino politics has for half a century been dominated by Cubans who fled Fidel Castro's rule and their descendants, and they have generally been solid Republicans because of their hostility to communism.</p> <p>But years of immigration from South and Central America, and more recently migrants from Puerto Rico, has not only contributed to a dramatic change in demographics \u2013 with Latinos rising from one-tenth of the state's population 30 years ago to nearly one quarter today \u2013 but has shifted the ground in this year's presidential election. And unlike many other new arrivals in Florida, people born in Puerto Rico are Americans citizens and can vote, even if their island is not a US state.</p> <p>\"The Puerto Rican vote in Florida is up for grabs,\" said Puerto Rico's Republican governor, Luis Fortuno. \"Puerto Ricans in Florida tend to be very conservative socially. If they are second or third generation moving south from New York, that's different. Those coming straight from Puerto Rico are social conservatives for whom issues such as high taxes are very important.\"</p> <p>Democrats say some of that is true. \"The Puerto Ricans like Romney because they are conservative,\" said Nicole Murillo, secretary of the Democratic party's Hispanic caucus in Kissimmee. \"They don't like abortion. They don't like gay marriage. But Romney as a person who can fix the economy \u2013 very few believe in that.</p> <p>\"When I hear from Latinos that they're not going to vote for Obama because he hasn't fixed the economy, I say: are you going to vote for Romney who only cares about the rich? I say look at it this way: they're both bad but you have to look at the one that is less bad. They say that makes sense.\"</p> <p>There are about one million Cuban Americans in Florida. <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/10/28/3070930_p3/miami-dade-commission-term-limits.html#storylink=cpy\">Opinion polls show about three out of four of them back Romney</a>, in large part because they do not believe Obama has been tough enough on Cuba's communist leadership.</p> <p>But there are also now about 850,000 Puerto Ricans resident in Florida. Many of the new arrivals have settled in Orlando and neighbouring Osceola County, where Kissimmee is the largest town. Latinos now make up 40% of residents and the sharp rise in the number of Puerto Ricans led to the area getting a new congressional district this year.</p> <p>Tammy Celeste, the chair of Kissimmee's Republican party, said that knocking on doors campaigning, she hears a lot of disillusionment with Obama.</p> <p>\"The guy promised them change. He promised them the world and they fell for it,\" she said. \"There's a lot of them that's changing their politics. Mostly they are conservative. They believe in what we believe in \u2013 less government, family. But they just need to be told in Spanish what we stand for. There are those who are much more favourable to [Obama] but they're the ones who don't want to work.\"</p> <p>Murillo, an immigrant from Colombia and a substitute teacher, said she, too, hears the distress over jobs when she's campaigning on streets lined with closed restaurants and shops plastered with \"For Rent\" signs. But that does not necessarily translate into support for Romney.</p> <p>\"In this area, Disney is the biggest employer. They've been cutting a lot of people,\" she said. \"Most of the time we worry more about jobs; how we are going to provide for our families. One of the things that is happening in central Florida, people are having two jobs. That was difficult but now some people have three or four part time jobs in order to provide for your family. People don't look at Romney and think he is going to bring more secure jobs or better pay.\"</p> <p>The Romney campaign is hitting the unemployment issue hard in adverts targeted at Latino voters. It has also bought blocks of air time on a Spanish-language liberal talk radio show during which surrogates get to argue the Republican candidate's case with a sceptical host and Obama supporter, Fernando Miguel Negron.</p> <p>Obama scored points with some Puerto Ricans in particular, and Latinos in general, by appointing Sonia Sotomayor, who is of Puerto Rican heritage, to the US supreme court. Two former Democratic party governors of Puerto Rico, Carlos Romero Barcel\u00f3 and Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez Col\u00f3n \u2013 who are renowned as bitter rivals on the island \u2013 joined forces in Kissimmee to endorse the president.</p> <p>Obama has tried to woo the Cuban American community with an endorsement from Cristina Saralegui, a talk show host sometimes described as the Oprah Winfrey of Spanish-language television in Florida. Saralegui, who arrived in Florida as a child refugee from Cuba, says she is backing Obama because he \"understands the Hispanic community and has supported it unconditionally\".</p> <p>Saralegui joined Michelle Obama in an advert where the first lady said it was important to reelect her husband because of the promise of immigration reform and preserving achievements such as healthcare and widening access to higher education.</p> <p>But while immigration plays significantly as an issue with Latino voters in other parts of the US \u2013 and Obama said in an interview with Spanish-language television that his failure to pass comprehensive immigration reform is his biggest failure to date \u2013 it does not have the same weight in Florida.</p> <p>Puerto Ricans, who have automatic American citizenship, have the right to vote if they live in the US, and most Cubans who make it to Florida are generally granted legal residence.</p> <p>But Republican leaders' attitudes toward immigration do have an impact in Florida, where Latinos are generally more sympathetic to the plight of the undocumented even if it is not so much of a voting issue. Murillo said Republican-sponsored legislation, such as anti-immigrant statutes in Arizona and Alabama, reinforce the perception that the party is hostile to minorities.</p> <p>\"I haven't heard people talking about immigration,\" she said. \"It's not a big issue. But people do talk about the Republicans and how they want self-deportation and to bring the Arizona laws to Florida. They want to make the only language English, but we raise our kids bilingual,\" she said.</p> <p>Romero said that while immigration is not a voting issue for her, she thinks the Republicans have called it wrong. \"People have sympathy for illegal immigrants. I don't see them lying in a hammock, getting a suntan. Many of them work three times as hard as an American,\" she said.</p> <p>Which puts her at odds with Romney's views. \"I think it's fair to say there's always room for change. We need to continue to review the policy,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>The race is on. The polls are in. We have a frontrunner in trouble. A muscular challenger making hay. Gaffes. Melt-downs. Campaign coffers swollen with cash. The only question is: can the voters learn to love a sandcastle humper? I refer, of course, to the race for the Academy Award for best actor. You didn't know it was already underway? Where have you been? You've got better elections to be obsessing over? </p> <p>While everyone's attention was diverted by the small matter of who gets to lead the free world, Hollywood has begun the five-month-long jamboree that now constitutes the run-up to the Academy Awards. </p> <p>Here's what you need to know: everyone has decided Jennifer Lawrence is going to win best actress. Joaquin Phoenix was the front-runner for best actor until a few weeks ago, <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Joaquin-Phoenix-Calls-Oscars-Bullshit-Shouldn-t-Surprise-Us-33666.html\">when he called the Oscars \"bullshit\"</a>. </p> <p>Then everyone had a freak-out on Twitter over Daniel Day-Lewis' accent, as revealed in the Lincoln trailer.

This year it looks like a three way race between Joaquin Phoenix, Denzel Washington and Daniel Day-Lewis. Thus far, Phoenix has been dominating the conversation with his electrifying jumble of method voodoo and chemically-induced jibber-jabber in The Master, although he damaged his chances considerably by giving an interview in which he called the Oscars \"bullshit. I think it's total, utter bullshit, and I don't want to be a part of it. I don't believe in it.\" </p> <p>Actors have gotten away with this sort of thing in the past \u2014 Dustin Hoffman called the Academy Awards \"<a href=\"http://www.alternativereel.com/cult_movies/display_article.php?id=0000000004\">a beauty contest</a>\" while George C Scott, nominated in 1970 for Patton, called the ceremonies \"<a href=\"http://www.alternativereel.com/cult_movies/display_article.php?id=0000000004\">a two-hour meat parade</a>\" but that was then. Such comments don't go sit well in the world of $15m Oscar campaigns.</p> <p>And the performance? Phoenix's portrait of a man in a state of acute spiritual undress is right up the Academy's street. They certainly like their meat gamey: see Halle Berry's win in 2000 for Monster's Ball, or Natalie Portman's 2010 win for Black Swan. Although it's also a curiously opaque, depthless performance, raising more questions about the intentions of the director Paul Thomas Anderson than it does Phoenix's character. <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/movies/2012/09/paul-thomas-anderson-the-master.html\">As Richard Brody put it</a>, \"It's not a work of psychological realism,\" one reason, perhaps, why the film has failed to catch on the box office. Is it too nuts even for the Academy? As one of the commentators at Hollywood Elsewhere put it, referring to a scene in which Phoenix makes out with a beach, \"Oscar doesn't generally go for sandcastle humping.\"</p> <p>This could well turn out to be the question of the season.</p> <p>Well, do they or don't they? Phoenix's main competition couldn't be more dignified or draped in gravitas \u2014 and twice decorated already. Given his track record at bringing American period to life, I wasn't sure Daniel Day-Lewis was going to find much fresh turf in Spielberg's Lincoln \u2013 between his Hawkeye, Bill the Butcher and Daniel Plainview, haven't we already seen his Abraham Lincoln? \u2013 but Day-Lewis tacks in the complete opposite direction to come up with a soft miracle: stoop-shouldered, spindly of frame, his Abe Lincoln is slightly weary, sagacious soul, but ramrod straight, driving the entire two-hour-and-twnety-minutes of Spielberg's epic as surely as an ox. </p> <p>Ordinarily I would say: no contest. One of our greatest screen actors, playing one of America's greatest presidents. No humped sandcastles, just nations rebuilt with blood, sweat and oratory. Call it a night and go home early. The only question hanging over the performance is whether the Academy are quite ready to usher Day-Lewis into the hallowed company of three-time winners that include the likes of Hepburn, Streep and Nicholson. Put it like that, and the prospect seems irresistible. The Academy are whores for \"greatness\" and love to make their own history. Or would they prefer to bestow that honor on Denzel Washington?</p> <p>He's landed one of the meatiest roles of his career in Robert Zemeckis's Flight (released last week), playing Whip Whitaker, the substance-abusing pilot who <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/oct/15/flight-first-look-review\">lands a malfunctioning plane while high as a kite</a>. </p> <p>It's by far the best star performance of the year, which is not to downplay it. As <a href=\" http://www.vulture.com/2012/11/movie-review-flight.html\">David Edelstein said </a>of Washington:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He's not an actor who opens himself up \u2013 you never quite feel you know him, underneath. But that's why his onscreen explorations of control and its opposite feel so right, so true to who he is as a performer and a man. When you watch Joaquin Phoenix in The Master, you see the Method at its most perilous and wobbly: you see an actor who has lost control as an actor and with it the ability to shape his performance. Phoenix is vivid but he's all over the place: if he played Whip, he'd be dissolving in the first shot, randomly zigging and zagging in the ether. But Washington takes Whip to another level. Despite the script's overfamiliar beats (yes, there are twelve-step meetings), he anatomizes Whip's existential seesaw. He breaks Whip's \u2013 and his own \u2013 cool into pieces, the good and the bad, the supremely potent and pathetically impotent. This is a titanic performance.</p> </blockquote> <p>My own feeling is that it's too good for the Oscars. Like Brad Pitt's performance in Moneyball last year, Washington's work in Flight has the kind of sanded ergonomic beauty that sails right past the grimacing and gurning required by the Academy to reassure them they are in the presence of \"great acting.\" </p> <p>Washington's major impact on this year's race could be to draw enough votes away from Day-Lewis to allow Phoenix to slip through - but right now, it feels like Day-Lewis's to lose.</p> <p><em>From now until 24 February this column will examine all the major categories in the Oscar race (best picture, best director, actor, actress, supporting actor, supporting actress) factoring in all the elements \u2013 talent, history, buzz, 'narrative', the arrangement of the tea leaves in Harvey Weinstein's morning cup of tea \u2013 that make for an Oscar win.

  "<p>President Obama has run one of the most secretive administrations in history. His commitment to a free press and free speech in the digital age is, at best, limited. Yet, Mitt Romney's record tells you that he'd make Obama look like a paragon of openness.</p> <p>Let's start with Obama, whose performance has been just north of abysmal on these matters. Let's give him credit for one major initiative that has been on the positive side: the administration's <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/open\">\"Open Government Initiative\"</a>, which was a polar opposite to the Bush era's default condition of secrecy. While it hasn't remotely kept his 2009 promise of \"creating an unprecedented level of openness in government\", it has led to the public availability of more data than we've seen in the past. And <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2011/12/06/data-released-via-the-open-government-directive-has-been-put-to-good-use/\">that data has been used in any number of ways by any number of people and organizations</a> to shine some light on our society and its government.</p> <p>But the Sunlight Foundation, which focuses exclusively on opening data for public use, has <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2011/12/07/obamas-open-government-directive-two-years-on/\">made clear how many departments and agencies have blown off the White House directives</a>, and how there's been no penalty for their obfuscations. At best, as the foundation puts it, the administration's record is mixed.</p> <p>On secrecy in other respects, the Obama crowd has not been significantly different from the George W Bush administration, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/02/obama-civil-liberties-history\">as Glenn Greenwald has described</a>. The White House and agencies have taken an even more expansive view of their right to withhold even the most basic information about what government is doing in our names and with our money. Two examples among many: American drones, which are killing people in a variety of undeclared war zones, don't officially exist. And the Obama justice department has made the breathtakingly Orwellian argument that the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/29/opinion/surveillance-and-accountability.html\">public can't go to court over government's illegal, pervasive electronic surveillance because it's a state secret</a>.</p> <p>When pressed hard on free speech and a free press, the Obama administration takes a dim view of both. The logic of <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/12/06/war_on_speech/\">its attacks on WikiLeaks</a> \u2013 public and secret \u2013 could be used against any major journalism organization that solicits and publishes leaked information. The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/sunday-review/a-high-tech-war-on-leaks.html\">Obama government has prosecuted more leakers, or whistleblowers,</a> than all the previous ones combined, and has spied on journalists in the process.</p> <p>Free speech in a digital era is about data networks. Here, too, the incumbent has, at best, a mixed record. The White House has talked a reasonably good game, as well, on keeping the internet open and not letting the telecom industry, Hollywood and other corporate interests lock it down to serve their own narrow purposes. In almost every case that matters, however, the administration's actions don't support those words.</p> <p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), with its Democratic majority, adopted rules promoting network neutrality \u2013 the idea that the broadband duopoly of cable and phone companies should not be allowed to favor one kind of data traffic over another, with a few exceptions aimed at network management. But the FCC's rules for mobile data, which is increasingly the way people use the internet, allow the carriers to manipulate and limit traffic pretty much at will, and the regulations for wired lines \u2013 which the industry has challenged in any case \u2013 are full of loopholes.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Obama government has almost always sided with the \"copyright cartel\" in its wish to take control of the internet. There's been one notable exception: the administration's belated, but welcome refusal to support the odious Sopa (Stop Online Privacy Act) earlier this year. But the government has repeatedly acted in ways that threaten free speech online, including its theft \u2013 this is the right word \u2013 of any number of domains it has decided to take down from the internet (after \"intellectual property\" holders complain and with no input from the alleged offenders).</p> <p>One was a hip-hop blog that got its domain back a year after its theft by the government, with <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/12/ice-admits-months-long-seizure-of-music-blog-was-a-mistake.ars\">not even a pretense of an apology</a>. And the administration has supported \u2013 in many cases, as the principal author \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/10/ceta-replicates-acta\">secretive</a> <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp\">treaty</a> <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/acta\">negotiations</a> that would create Sopa-like, and worse, laws via backdoor methods.</p> <p>At the same time, the Obama justice department has repeatedly made clear that it wants ever more surveillance powers. This what every government does, no matter who runs it, but Obama once claimed to be in favor of civil liberties \u2013 and then broke almost every promise in this arena (with the one exception of gay rights).</p> <p>All of this \u2013 and there's much more \u2013 would make someone who believes in open government, free speech and an open internet long for a better candidate. Unfortunately, the other major-party candidate this year would almost certainly be worse in every way.</p> <p>Romney's penchant for secrecy goes beyond his refusal to disclose his own finances \u2013 thereby denying voters a chance to see how the man who claims his business record would make him a good president has actually behaved with his money. He and his associates hid or disposed of documents that would shed light on his two other major professional achievements: <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/politics/articles/2012/07/24/after_romney_pledged_transparent_olympics_key_documents_were_destroyed/?page=full\">his Olympics leadership in Utah</a> and <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/12/06/questions-raised-about-romneys-disposal-of-records/\">his administration as governor of Massachusetts</a>. </p> <p>Romney is against network neutrality \u2013 in favor of an internet that big companies control for their own purposes. His party wants to wage a war on pornography, even though that would be a proxy war on free speech itself. And he's even more hostile to civil liberties \u2013 except the right create home arsenals of firearms \u2013 than Obama, which is saying something.</p> <p>I wish the press had paid more attention to these matters in the past few years, or at least during the campaign, but in an era when journalists have abandoned even the pretense of doing their jobs, that's a forlorn hope. I'll have much more to say on the performance of the media in my next column.</p>",
  "<p>New York City and surrounding metro areas have other things to worry about right now, but local newspapers Newsday and the Daily News came out for Mitt Romney on Sunday (joining the New York Post, which predictably <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/mitt_will_get_the_jobs_done_9hpevJPvBnMgJ0GMyGb0GO\">backed Rommey a week ago</a>). In both latest cases the supporting arguments are \u2013 in a technical sense \u2013 nuts.</p> <p>Newsday's op-ed <a href=\"http://www.newsday.com/opinion/editorial-elect-mitt-romney-president-of-the-united-states-1.4182689\">explaining its endorsement </a>is largely about Obama's economic failures. But it goes on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Obama said he would pass comprehensive immigration reform, but he never made a significant attempt to address it.</p> <p>He said future generations would look back on his election as the time we began to slow the rise of the oceans and hasten the healing of the planet, yet he never introduced meaningful legislation aimed at achieving those goals.</p> <p>Obama promised a transparent administration but instead ran a secretive White House. And Obama promised a newfound respect for civil liberties, and yet, in an expansive reading of congressional authority to use military force, he has authorized the unilateral assassination of American citizens abroad</p> </blockquote> <p>Er \u2026 so for climate change action, immigration reform, civil liberties, vote Mitt Romney? What was it the Economist said? \"Mr Romney has an economic plan that works only if you don't believe most of what he says.\"</p> <p>The New York Daily News \u2013 the neglected plaything of forgotten Canadian media magnate Mort Zuckerman \u2013 has also flipped and endorsed Mitt Romney in this election.</p> <p>Its <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/choice-america-future-mitt-romney-article-1.1196299\">editorial</a> is also all over the place in making the case for Romney.

When DC finally got the breakthrough goal, having missed that first half penalty, they went straight back on the front foot \u2014 maybe thinking this was the moment to press home the advantage and maybe even put the tie out of reach. But one thing you can say about this New York side, is that there's always a goal in them, even when they look like they've had nothing to offer all game. Sure enough they got one...from the opposing goalkeeper, then they got a further gift, as Najar, who'd played his part in tormenting their wide defenders all night, picked up a stupid red card for throwing the ball back at the referee. Whether he meant it or not, it was a petulant reaction and he will be missing on Wednesday night.</p> <p>It would be a foolish man who tried to call Wednsday's game with any confidence. You'd expect a less cautious New York in that game, but you'd also expect Chris Pontius, dangerous all night here, to pick up where he left off.

The penalty and the miss by Pontius may prove costly, but at the moment you'd have to say DC look like there's a goal in them here, while you can't yet truly say the same for New York.&#xa0;</p> <p>As it is though, the rule is draw on the road and win at home, and at the moment New York are drawing on the road.

Up front Cooper and Henry have combined for 33 goals this season, with Henry having 15 goals and 12 assists. But behind them, everything seems to be in a state of constant flux. Dax McCarty anchored their midfield in the earlier part of the season, and won a lot of people round who\u2019d been unimpressed when he arrived in New York as part of the De Rosario deal last year. With the arrival of Tim Cahill and the slow return from injury of Teemu Tainio, McCarty has found himself being pushed out wide, which one again puts the focus on the defense he had been sweeping up in front of for much of the season (though he may be back in the center tonight, in the possible absence of Cahill). Decent defenders have arrived in Pearce and Conde, and rookies and fringe players such as Lade and Barklage have seized their chance when it has arrived, but from week to week there seems to be no consistency on the defensive line up and as a result New York have tended to leak goals in the opening 20 minutes of games. Against sides like Portland they were able to recover from early 2-0 deficits and win, against sides like Sporting KC, they just lost 2-0. There are rather more Sporting KC\u2019s than Portland Timbers in the playoffs.</p> <p>That said, the Red Bulls have recently hit a little bit of defensive form with two clean sheets, and last weekend won on the road for the first time since May, just in time for the playoffs. A lot though depends on what New York, and what Henry, shows up for each game.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5095abc395cb1506d2444813\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-03T23:41:55.292Z\">11.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">DC United</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back in the playoffs for the first time since 2007, DC United eased into the playoffs as the form team - at least looking at results. Performances during the run in have rather put their fans through the wringer though. They struggled to break down a wretched Toronto team, fell behind to Columbus in a crucial game, then with 2nd place and avoiding a wild-card game on the line, went a goal down to Chicago Fire. These were the sort of games they went on to lose in their collapse down the stretch last year. But this year, they got a scrappy goal against Toronto, came back to win in stoppage time against Columbus and equalized in Chicago - the latter goal sending the Fire to their date with ignominy in the wild-card game.&#xa0;</p> <p>All of this \"finding a way to win\" has in part been the result of coach Ben Olsen having his hand forced by the season-ending injury his playmaker Dwayne de Rosario endured at the start of the run-in. For a side whose attacking movement depended on the creativity and directness of DeRo, his loss could have been disastrous, but Olsen retooled the focus of the team on defense, and trusted that some combination of his forward men would get a goal at the other end. It\u2019s made the DC side harder to score against, and keeper Bill Hamid has really come into his own (he made some great stops to keep his team in the game against Chicago last week), though the goals, when they have come, have sometimes been from unexpected sources (Lewis Neal, anyone?). Still, it\u2019s working - and there\u2019s no questioning the spirit of the side Olsen has built.&#xa0;</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5095a99695cb1506d2444812\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-03T23:32:38.505Z\">11.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>OK, let\u2019s deal with the big one first. This game was supposed to be New York Red Bulls facing DC United at Red Bull Arena, as the first leg of their Eastern Conference semi-final. The decisive return leg was to have been played at DC\u2019s RFK Stadium on Wednesday.&#xa0;</p> <p>But then Sandy happened \u2014 and with power lines down, PATH trains flooded, blocked and otherwise unusable, and emergency services stretched, it swiftly became clear that the prospects for holding the game at Red Bull Arena tonight, let alone anyone being able (or inclined) to get there was absolutely minimal. So it proved - and the games have been switched, at the agreement of the teams\u2019 senior managers and the league. It means that instead of hosting the first game, the lower-seeded Red Bulls will actually be playing at home in the second leg, with tonight\u2019s game happening at RFK.</p> <p>Not that Wednesday\u2019s game is guaranteed to be played in New York yet \u2014 nobody is putting concrete figures on recovery times for vital infrastructure, as the full magnitude of the damage unfolds. The league offices themselves have been in the dark for much of the week, and everything is very provisional around the return leg. In theory, DC United will have a larger and better seat allocation for their fans to compensate for conceding the home advantage conferred on them by seeding, but that might all be academic - UPDATE: Just as this story was launching New York <a href=\"http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/news/2012/11/red-bulls-release-update-red-bull-arena\">issued a statement saying Wednesday's game will go ahead at Red Bull Arena</a>.</p> <p>Anyway, tonight it\u2019s DC United vs New York Red Bulls. And so far this year that has meant goals - fourteen of them in three games between the sides. A 4-1 home win and a Pontius hat trick for DC, Barklage\u2019s brace against his former team in New York\u2019s 3-2 revenge win, then DeRosario\u2019s 100th goal celebrations cut short by Wilman Conde\u2019s thunderous last minute goal to tie the rubber game 2-2. So should we expect goals tonight? Well, not so fast. A lot has changed since those games for both sides, not least the venue for tonight\u2019s game.</p> <p>I\u2019ll have more on those changes, build up and team news shortly.

  "<p>The mood around Loftus Road was encapsulated by a Queens Park Rangers fan sauntering into his favourite pre-match eaterie to rub his hands together and announce: \"Mark Hughes kebab, anyone?\" Some 65 minutes into this tussle between the Premier League's two winless wonders, with Reading ahead and QPR bottom of the table, the sentiment resonated. The atmosphere changed a minute later as Djibril Ciss\u00e9 scored to give his team \u2013 and his manager \u2013 a lifeline.</p> <p>Averting defeat was paramount. That did not prevent a smattering of boos, and some discontent aired at Hughes's stewarship, at full time. With more than a quarter of the season gone and the win column of the table still stuck on zero, it is understandable that there are jitters in the stands. Hughes did not attempt to hide from the reality of the situation. \"We are not sticking our head in the sand,\" he said. \"Our intention is to get out of it. This was an opportunity to do that and we haven't taken it.\"</p> <p>The Welshman had suggested a change of luck was overdue. But that was not the issue when they fell behind in the 16th minute, with the defence again suffering a sudden power cut. QPR struggled to deal with a corner, Sean Morrison looped a header on to the crossbar and the rebound fell towards Kaspars Gorkss. The Latvian centre-half did well to get his body into a shooting position and even better to thump the ball through a melee of hooped defenders. His effort was powerful enough to crunch through J\u00falio C\u00e9sar's attempted save.</p> <p>Gorkss's celebration was tinged with the emotion of the ex. He had been part of QPR's promotion team but was deemed surplus to requirements when investment rolled in. In the stands the visiting supporters tempered their elation with some gallows humour. \"We're going to win 8-6,\" they chanted. They have seen enough of their team not to expect a 1-0 scoreline to last for long this season.</p> <p>If QPR were hoping that Reading's enthusiasm would have been dented by their 7-5 defeat in the Capital One Cup in midweek, they were mistaken. Brian McDermott's team had abundant appetite and ferocious workrate, epitomised by the midfield pair of a buzzing Jay Tabb and confident Mikele Leigertwood. After conceding, the tension on the home team ratcheted up. You could hear it gnawing at the grumbling crowd. You could sense it in the body language of the players. Ciss\u00e9 rushed a shot that led to a vexed chorus.</p> <p>QPR found it difficult to click. They strained to build anything constructive in the danger zone, as most of their glimmers came from individuals taking pot shots from long range. There was little reason in QPR's gameplan, little rhythm in its execution. The maverick Adel Taarabt did as much as anyone to try to drag them back into the game, taking aim from distance three times in quick succession. Hughes praised the \"responsibility and maturity\" shown by a player who, for all his natural talent, has not always been the most dependable.</p> <p>There was more encouragement as the composed Esteban Granero whipped in a splendid free-kick, which Alex McCarthy tipped brilliantly on to the crossbar. It was the one moment of artistic merit within an agricultural first half. Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa followed up with slightly less refinement and the chance was lost.</p> <p>After the break QPR began to press, peg Reading back and look as if they had more capability of wearing their opponent down. The relief was palpable when they equalised midway through the second half. Ciss\u00e9 deserved all the plaudits as he intuitively controlled a cross, creating the space for himself to steer into the bottom corner.</p> <p>Buoyed, they went for the jugular. Taarabt's ferocious drive was palmed away by McCarthy. The Moroccan was astonished not to have won it seven minutes from the end when he latched on to the best move of the match, as Bobby Zamora and Ciss\u00e9 combined fluently to scythe through the Reading rearguard. Taarabt's shot was well directed and only an inspired save from McCarthy, with an outstretched leg, maintained parity.</p> <p>Although Reading also need a Premier League win, they were content enough with an away point, especially as QPR had seemed the likelier victor in the latter stages. McDermott has experience of seeing Reading clamber from an unpromising position to a happy ending, and at the moment betrays no obvious concerns. \"I take heart from our players. I walk into work every day and they pick me up. They have terrific spirit.\"</p> <p>QPR's contingent trundled off with their fears about the season's prospects still rumbling on. Hughes tried to tackle the sequence without a win as calmly as he could. \"The sooner it changes the better,\" he said. \"Before the season we anticipated a really successful season. The longer this goes on the less chance of that successful season happening. We need a break.\"</p> <p>Even those whose patience with Hughes is wearing thin could not argue with that.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Alex McCarthy (Reading)</p>",
  "<p>My sister Cynthia Gifford, who has died of cancer aged 65, was a successful and respected barrister dealing with family law. Many believed that had she come to the profession earlier in her career, she would have easily made the judiciary. Judges appreciated Cynthia's competent, caring advocacy in the courts, while solicitors liked her realistic, practical approach and sympathetic attitude.</p> <p>She was born in North Cheam, Surrey, and studied politics and modern history at Manchester University where, following the birth of her daughter, Emma, she gained a 2.1 and, in 1971, an MSc in public administration.</p> <p>Cynthia had a great love of Africa especially Nigeria and went there in the 1970s to do VSO work. She returned in the early 80s and for a time was involved in selling turn-key (fully equipped and ready to run) hospitals, travelling around unaccompanied from state to state, negotiating with governors and their senior officials.</p> <p>Law was always a subject of interest to her and it finally beckoned as a career. She was called to the bar in 1988. I remember her saying that it was one of the toughest things she had studied for but she was helped by being in a study group. Her friend Julia recounts how Cynthia's enthusiasm, clarity of thought and persuasiveness soon meant she became de facto \"captain\" of the group. These half dozen or so would-be lawyers often used to meet in Cynthia's flat near Bloomsbury, central London, and they formed enduring friendships.</p> <p>In Nigeria, Cynthia met her partner, Ray \u2013 attracted to him, he says, as he was the only other leftie among the expats there. They shared a love of literature, theatre, art, music, food and wine, and had a mutual desire for a world where all people are treated fairly and decently. They both supported the women's liberation movement and were members of the Labour party. Cycling was a passion of Cynthia's and for many years they enjoyed holidays on the continent.</p> <p>She was a superb cook and her apple strudel was legendary. She was also a fine artist. One retirement project was a book illustrating table settings for cuisines from around the world. This would have been an essential guide to hosting authentic dinner parties and the drawings would probably have been reproduced as prints, table mats and teacloths.</p> <p>She is survived by Ray, Emma and two nephews, Simon and Jamie.</p>",
  "<p>Now that Sandy has exacted a steep toll in lives and property, the question is unavoidable: why do so many people in America refuse to take climate science seriously?</p> <p>I am not assuming that Sandy was the direct consequence of human-caused climate change. But with this fresh evidence of the impact of climate issues on real people, how is it possible for anyone to think that thousands of scientists around the world are engaged in an elaborate hoax? </p> <p>The standard reply is that some powerful organizations \u2013 above all, in the fossil fuel industry \u2013 think that they can benefit from misleading the public, and have funded a successful disinformation campaign. There is a lot of truth to this answer, but it isn't the whole truth. </p> <p>For the average climate science denier in the street (and there are a lot of them on some streets), there is often little correlation between the vehemence of their denials and the so-called \"facts\" at their disposal. The average Chuck is like Chuck Norris, who has <a href=\"http://townhall.com/columnists/chucknorris/2009/12/08/chestnuts_roasting_on_a_copenhagen_fire/page/full/\">claimed that climate science is a \"trick\"</a>. Not an innocent mistake, not a systemic bias, but a premeditated fraud.</p> <p>Climate science denial needs disinformation to survive, but it has its feet firmly planted in a part of American culture. That culture draws on lots of different sources. But if you want to understand it, you need to understand something about America's religious landscape. </p> <p>Take a look at some of the most recent initiatives in the climate science denial wars. In Louisiana, Tennessee, New Hampshire and other states, legislatures have either passed or put forward bills intended to disinform secondary-school students about climate science. Sure, they paper over the assault on education with claims that they only want to teach \"both sides\" of the issue and encourage \"critical thinking\". But, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/feb/15/leaked-heartland-institute-documents-climate-scepticism\">leaked documents made clear in at least one instance</a>, the ultimate purpose is to produce a young generation of \"skeptics\" whose views on climate science will happily coincide with those of the fossil fuel industry.</p> <p>Who is behind these programs of de-education?</p> <p>The group writing much of the legislation is the <a href=\"http://www.alec.org\">American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec)</a>, a \"nonpartisan\" consortium of state legislators and business interests that gets plenty of money from the usual suspects. But the legislation has also received vital support from groups associated with the religious right. For example, the perversely named Louisiana Science Education Act, which opens the door to climate science denial in the classroom, was co-authored by the Discovery Institute, a Seattle-based creationist thinktank. That act also received <a href=\"http://lasciencecoalition.org/2012/01/05/gutting-bese-policy-untold-story/\">crucial support from the Alliance Defending Freedom</a>, the well-funded Christian legal advocacy group that has described itself as \"a servant organization that provides the resources that will keep the door open for the spread of the Gospel\", and which promotes a radical religious agenda in public schools. </p> <p>What does religion have to do with climate science? Radical religious activists promote the anti-science bills, in part, because they also seek to undermine the teaching of evolution \u2013 another issue that supposedly has \"two sides\", so schools should \"teach the controversy\". Now, you don't have to believe that Earth was created in six hectic days in order to be skeptical about climate science, but a large number of climate science deniers also happen to be evolution deniers. </p> <p>What exactly is the theology of climate science denial? The <a href=\"http://www.cornwallalliance.org\">Cornwall Alliance</a> \u2013 a coalition whose list of signatories could double as a directory of major players in the religious right \u2013 has a produced a <a href=\"http://www.cornwallalliance.org/articles/read/an-evangelical-declaration-on-global-warming/\">declaration asserting</a>, as a matter of <em>theology</em>, that \"there is no convincing scientific evidence that human contribution to greenhouse gases is causing dangerous global warming.\"</p> <p>It also tells us \u2013 on the firm foundation of Holy Scriptures \u2013 that policies intended to slow the pace of climate change represent a \"dangerous expansion of government control over private life\". It also alerts us that the environmental movement is \"un-Biblical\" \u2013 indeed, a new and false religion. If the Cornwall Declaration seems like a tough read, you can get what you need from the organization's DVD series: \"Resisting the Green Dragon: A Biblical Response to one of the Greatest Deceptions of our Day.\"</p> <p>Now, this isn't the theology of every religion in America, or of every strain of Christianity; not by a long stretch. Most Christians accept climate science and believe in protecting the environment, and many of them do so for religious as well as scientific reasons. But theirs is not the theology that holds sway in the upper reaches of the Republican party, or moves your average climate science denier Chuck. As <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/07/rick-santorum-global-warming-hoax_n_1260168.html\">Rick Santorum explained at an energy summit in Colorado</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We were put on this Earth as creatures of God to have dominion over the Earth \u2026 for our benefit not for the Earth's benefit.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Why does this theology of science denial have such power? For one thing, it gives its adherents something to throw back in the face of all those obnoxious \"elites\", which they think are telling them what to do with their lives. There's no need to master the facts if all you need is to learn a few words of scripture. </p> <p>But, perhaps, more to the point is that this kind of religion works for Chuck because it allows him to disguise the extraordinary selfishness of his position in a cloak of sanctimony. Translated into the kind of language that you can take to the shopping mall, it says that God wants you to squeeze whatever you can out of the earth \u2013 and to hell with the grandkids.</p> <p>I hear plenty of cynicism about the choice facing people this Tuesday, 6 November. Some say that it really doesn't matter who gets elected. It is true that Obama has largely kept climate change out of the campaign. But it is delusional to imagine that Obama is just the same as Romney and the Republican party on this issue. Paul Ryan is <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/08/11/677051/meet-paul-ryan-climate-denier-conspiracy-theorist-koch-acolyte/\">on record as a world-class climate science denier</a>. <a href=\"http://www.desmogblog.com/2012/10/31/romney-aide-andrea-saul-denies-climate-connection-hurricane-katrina-sandy-next\">Mitt Romney's press secretary</a> has been a shill for oil companies.</p> <p>Romney's proposals on energy policy and climate issues, so far as they can be discerned, are indistinguishable from those of the fossil fuel industry. And anyone who thinks that Republican party policies won't be informed by some of that old-time religion simply hasn't been listening to what its candidates have to say about women, reproductive rights, and what they speciously call \"religious liberty\".</p> <p>There is a choice. And even if <em>you</em> don't think it matters, your grandkids will.</p>",
  "<p>The mother of a 28-year-old man with <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Cerebral-palsy/Pages/Introduction.aspx\" title=\"\">cerebral palsy</a> is suing the hospital where he died, alleging its staff failed to consult her on a decision not to attempt resuscitation and did not administer his medication appropriately.</p> <p>A coroner has raised concerns about the way Carl Winspear received medication in hospital last year, writing an official letter to the Department of Health (DoH) and City Hospitals Sunderland NHS foundation trust over drug procedures at Sunderland Royal hospital.</p> <p>The legal action by Elaine Winspear comes as a separate case over the use of so-called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/aug/26/do-not-resuscitate-medical-patient\" title=\"\">\"do not resuscitate\" (DNR) orders</a> begins at the high court in London on Monday. That case has been filed by the family of a woman who died in Addenbrooke's hospital, Cambridge, last year.</p> <p>Relatives want to clarify the law on how DNR decisions are reached for patients with mental capacity to decide and force the DoH in England to establish a national policy, instead of medical staff being expected to follow <a href=\"http://www.resus.org.uk/pages/dnar.pdf\" title=\"\">professional guidance</a> and local policies.</p> <p>Carl Winspear, who did not have mental capacity to make all his own decisions, died of pneumonia in Sunderland Royal hospital in January 2011.</p> <p>His mother's lawyer says a doctor unilaterally decided not to attempt resuscitation if he suffered cardiac or respiratory arrest, recording in the medical notes \"speak to family in morning\".</p> <p>Mrs Winspear told the Guardian that later that morning she was approached by the doctor to ask if she would consider a DNR, but she was not told of any decision having already been made. She said she strongly disagreed with an order being put in place, but claims an undated DNR order was subsequently found by the family in the medical notes.</p> <p>\"His main concern was talking about 'people like this' or 'people like that'. He was talking about his condition. Because a person has a condition, it doesn't mean that every person is going to be the same.</p> <p>\"It seems the doctor assumed Carl did not have a quality of life. He had a better quality of life than you or I do. He went to a day centre five days a week, doing different things. One day, he might go out for fish and chips, another, they would take him to a pub, a third it would be the allotment.\"</p> <p>Derek Winter, the Sunderland coroner who recorded a verdict of death by natural causes at Winspear's inquest in July 2011, was worried by problems with the intravenous administration of drugs during his treatment. He wrote to the hospital and the health department over delays in giving Winspear loading doses \u2013 large doses of medicine over short times \u2013 to try to deliver quick therapeutic responses.</p> <p>Winspear's mother said: \"I am not saying he would have come through, but who is to say he would not have come through.\"</p> <p>Mrs Winspear's lawyer, Merry Varney, of <a href=\"http://www.leighday.co.uk/home\" title=\"\">Leigh Day</a>, said she \"has been left feeling that Carl was grossly let down by the hospital, that he did not receive the drugs that could have eased his suffering and that perhaps more could and should have been done for Winspear but his doctors seemed heavily influenced purely by his disability.\"</p> <p>She also pointed to the low involvement of patients or relatives in DNR decisions found in a review of current procedures by the <a href=\"http://www.ncepod.org.uk/2012report1/downloads/CAP_fullreport.pdf\" title=\"\">National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death</a>.</p> <p>The City Hospitals Sunderland NHS trust said it was unable to comment at this stage.</p> <p>Varney also represents David Tracey in his case against Cambridge University Hospitals NHS foundation trust. Monday's hearing will to establish the facts regarding the imposition of two DNR orders on his wife, Janet, while she was in Addenbrooke's hospital in March 2011. She suffered a neck fracture in a car crash soon after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. The trust disputes family accounts of the events. The hearing to resolve the facts is listed for up to 10 days. A full judicial review into the lack of a nationwide policy on DNRs is listed due to start in February.</p>",
  "<p>Leading Republicans in a key Florida battleground have condemned Mitt Romney's campaign for writing off African American voters and attitudes toward minorities that they say have cost the party crucial support.</p> <p>Art Wood, chairman of the Republican party in Hillsborough County, a diverse area of about one million people and one of the most heavily contested regions of the state, said his party's presidential candidate failed to even try to win over black voters.</p> <p>\"Romney did a really poor job with minorities. That was my greatest disappointment. You'd go on to his website and he'd have a column for outreach. You clicked on that and there was Catholics for Romney, Democrats for Romney, fishermen for Romney. You never saw blacks or African Americans for Romney until four weeks ago,\" Wood said.</p> <p>\"I think it's the big frigging smart guys at the top who think they know how to run a campaign, and they probably just wrote off the African American vote. Romney did a really poor job with the African Americans. They're in many ways like Hispanics. They favour traditional marriage, they go to church regularly, they're suffering worse from unemployment.\"</p> <p>Wood was backed by a Republican contender for the US Congress in the area, EJ Otero, who is not even including his party affiliation on his election posters and literature because he thinks it will harm his chances.</p> <p>\"I think it's true but not only with the Romney campaign. That's a problem with the Republican party as a whole, and not just with African Americans. Hispanics, too. The Republican party has written off African Americans and Hispanics for the past 20 years and it needs to change,\" he said.</p> <p>Otero, a former air force colonel who served in Iraq and is of Cuban descent, said part of his party's problem is how it discusses issues that are important to minorities such as immigration and welfare.</p> <p>\"I do believe we've got to get off the emotional argument of: the border, the border, the border. We need to control the border so white slavery stops and narco trafficking. But when it comes to the people, we're talking about community,\" he said. \"There's also this myth that all poor people want here is handouts. They don't. All they want is the jobs they used to have.\"</p> <p>Otero acknowledged that he has distanced himself from his own party. \"I put my ideas. Nowhere in there does it say I'm a Republican. That's not helpful,\" he said.</p> <p>African American and Latino voters waiting outside the C Blythe Andrews library in Tampa to cast their ballot in early voting said Republican attitudes towards the less well off, and even \"fear\" of a Romney presidency, is driving people in the area to the polls.</p> <p>\"This is a serious election,\" said Tonya Lewis who runs a charity, Children With A Vision, to help underprivileged young people in school. \"There's been so much negativity from the Republicans. Mitt Romney scares the hell out of me. Romney can't relate to the people, he has no connection to the people. People are really afraid because if you get somebody whose worth millions of dollars, how can they know?\"</p> <p>Betty Reed, a Democratic party representative in the Florida legislature, said that turnout for early voting in the area is so high that she was arranging buses to move people to less busy polling stations.</p> <p>\"Voters in this area support the president but they're turning out to keep Romney out. His campaign played a big role. He went to the NAACP meeting and he talked about how he wanted to get rid of Planned Parenthood, things that are good for poor people. He didn't talk about what he would do for us,\" she said. \"Race is also a part of it. There's more than one issue but we know some people did not want Obama to be successful as president and we know why.\"</p> <p>Vivien Warren, who was brought from Cuba to the US as a child, was among those at the library voting for Obama. She said that the Republican-controlled Florida legislature's cutting in half of the number of days early voting, along with attempts to introduce new photo identification requirements at polling places that were struck down by a federal court as discriminatory, also drove people to vote.</p> <p>\"There's been a lot of talk among people about voter suppression. People are angry. How dare they? They're trying to prevent us from voting,\" she said.</p> <p>\"People are also angry that Romney and the Republicans have been disrespectful of the office of the president. The way Romney talked to him at the debate. People think that's about race. They don't want a black person in the White House.\"</p> <p>The legislature's removal of the last Sunday before the general election as an early voting day \u2013 a day when many African Americans went to the polls after church \u2013 mobilised religious leaders to launch a campaign, Souls to the Polls, to get black people to vote the previous Sunday instead. Vote monitors say it was successful and that turnout in minority districts will at least match that of 2008.</p>",
  "<p>The view from the terrace behind the town hall in Corleto Perticara is as grand as any in Tuscany, taking in the majestic Sauro river valley and a line of towering hills that shepherd the river out to sea. But where a visitor might dream of building an idyllic second home, Rosaria Vicino, the town's mayor, is picturing the line of well-head pumpjacks that will soon pepper the undulating slopes beyond the Sauro.</p> <p>In May, Mario Monti's non-party government in Rome gave the go-ahead for the development of the so-called Tempa Rossa field, whose 200m barrels of heavy, sulphurous petroleum lie within Vicino's comune (borough). The French company Total has a 75% stake in Tempa Rossa. Shell has the remaining 25% interest in a field whose production capacity is expected to reach 50,000 barrels a day (b/d).</p> <p>\"Oil is central to our development plans,\" said Vicino fervently. \"It is the element around which all our hopes revolve.\"</p> <p>Onshore oil and gas production is similarly central to the Italian government's ambitious plan to lop \u20ac14bn (\u00a311.2bn) off the nation's annual \u20ac62bn bill for energy imports by 2020. The target is set in a proposed national energy plan that would be the first to be adopted in Italy for more than 20 years.</p> <p>A draft, put out for consultation last month, sees some of the savings coming from increases in \"green\" (renewable) sources and \"white\" (efficiency) economies. But it also envisages a doubling of domestic oil and gas production. The government estimates the increase in output could provide Italy with 7% of its total energy requirements and create 25,000 new jobs.</p> <p>Crude oil production in Italy peaked in 2005 at 115,000 b/d, and has since slumped below 100,000 b/d \u2013 not due to a lack of reserves (Italy's proven onshore deposits are the biggest in Europe), but because of a drastic fall in exploration and development, which the government is keen to reverse.</p> <p>It aims to boost crude oil production by almost 150%, and bringing the Tempa Rossa field on stream will take it about a third of the way to that goal. Even considering the beauty of the countryside around Corleto Perticara, Tempa Rossa is unlikely to stir much opposition locally.</p> <p>Mention of royalties brings an ear-to-ear smile to the face of mayor Vicino, who readily agrees that the 30 or 40 years of income will transform the fortunes of little Corleto Perticara and its 2,700 inhabitants. The cash should be ample recompense for the pumpjacks \u2013 often known as \"nodding donkeys\" \u2013 and a large, smelly oil-processing centre that Total plans to build beyond the hills, out of sight of the town.</p> <p>The scenic but remote region of Basilicata in which Corleto Perticara is situated, is often called Italy's Texas. It holds about three quarters of the country's total reserves. But not everyone is as enthusiastic about pumping them out as Mayor Vicino. Many in Basilicata resent the fact that the royalties from oil production go largely to the local authorities directly affected and make little impact on a region that, despite its black gold, is still Italy's fifth poorest.</p> <p>Basilicata's communications are dire. Unemployment is high and rising. In January, Monti's government slipped a clause into a bill ostensibly about liberalisation that allows future oil royalties to be used for regional infrastructure projects. A senior government official acknowledged it was designed specifically to assuage criticism in Basilicata. So far, it has not worked.</p> <p>In August, the regional assembly declared a moratorium on all further exploration and production in Basilicata. The next day, the governor, Vito De Filippo of the centre-left Democratic Party (PD), declared that the petroleum concessions that had already been granted were \"at the limits of sustainability\". His opinion matters because, as the law in Italy stands, approval from his government is essential for future projects to go ahead.</p> <p>It has not helped that Tempa Rossa is mired in a scandal that is set to unfold as the field is developed. On 26 September, four former executives of Total's Italian subsidiary, including its former managing director, went on trial in the regional capital of Potenza accused of rigging the tender for the oil treatment centre so that the contract went to a consortium headed by a local builder. The builder was in turn accused of paying a \u20ac200,000 bribe to a PD deputy in the national parliament.</p> <p>Total's former employees are also charged with using a local official to get landowners in the area to take lower-than-market offers for land needed to develop the oil field. All the accused deny wrongdoing.</p>",

I agree.</p> <p>The moments in teaching that stand out for teachers and pupils are the times when you ditch the lesson plan and follow a child's idea; when you change the layout of the classroom; or when you hear an expert speak and it changes how you see the world. But this isn't what Michael Gove means.</p> <p>On 23 October, he wrote to MPs in Derby and Leicester, areas of high deprivation, large multi-ethnic communities, and schools which are \"below the national average\" to tell them that they had to choose between supporting academies and free schools, or backing those who are blocking school improvement.</p> <p>This beautifully crafted rhetoric places Gove and his government firmly on the side of the angels, and the rest of us as the \"enemies of promise\". Robin Alexander, who led the Cambridge Primary Review, describes this kind of government rhetoric as \"<a href=\"http://www.robinalexander.org.uk/docs/UKLA.pdf\" title=\"\">the discourses of dichotomy, derision, myth and meaninglessness</a>\"</p> <p>The dichotomy is pretty easy to spot: you either have academies or you have failing schools. According to Gove the only one way to improve a school is to change its status and support mechanisms so that it is accountable to him as secretary of state for education.</p> <p>His derision is clear too. Those who don't believe academies and free schools are the solution to all education problems should be mocked as the forces of conservatism. By daring to call for consultations, suggesting that changes should be trialled and reviewed, and asking the government to assess the impact of changes on children and teachers we are derided for \"urging delay\" and blighting children's lives.</p> <p>Michael Gove is clever at creating myths about education as much by what he doesn't say as by what he does. Most people could be forgiven for believing that academisation is the only way to improve schools. We hear a lot about successful academies because government ministers visit them to make their announcements. And of course they should be celebrated; particularly those in enormously deprived areas. But there are also other extremely successful schools which are rarely mentioned.</p> <p>The most worrying aspect of the government's, and Gove's, one-solution school improvement policy is the single-mindedness with which it is pursued. Schools which fail an Ofsted inspection or fall below floor targets will be converted into academies. Outstanding schools will be turned into academies. Parents who are dissatisfied with their child's school will be persuaded to set up a free school. Any new school has to be an academy or free school. And quite conveniently Ofsted has tightened its criteria, floor targets are getting higher, exams will be harder and a shortage of primary places means we need new primary schools \u2013 all speeding the growth of academies.</p> <p>Of course there is always room for improvement. There are always pupils who don't do as well as they could, and schools which need to be challenged. There are innovations in teaching practice and leadership, and new research about how children learn. Teachers should be, and are, continually striving to become better teachers.</p> <p>But Gove's call for openness is all one way: teachers must be open to the government's ideas. A government that really believed in openness wouldn't start a consultation on the biggest exam shake up for decades by asking whether it's given the new exam the right name. It would listen when the public and professional consensus is that the phonics check forces six-year-olds to learn nonsense.</p> <p>I'm insulted to be told that I don't put children first by a government which is presiding over an increase in child poverty. I'm angry to be told this government knows better than teachers, parents and academics about children's needs.</p> <p>True openness requires the humility to realise that you might be wrong, an ability to listen to people with different ideas, and an acceptance that people with different views might also want what's best for children and young people. It will be too late to apologise in 30 years time; the damage will already have been done to today's children and teachers.</p> <p><em>Nansi Ellis is head of education policy at the </em><a href=\"http://www.atl.org.uk/\" title=\"Association of Teachers and Lecturers\"><em>Association of Teachers and Lecturers</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Throughout a long, warm, hazy Maharashtran afternoon, as Cheteshwar Pujara and Hiken Shah, over the course of almost four hours, were painstakingly constructing a third-wicket partnership of 163 that stopped England in their tracks, the tourists were reminded, if they had already forgotten, what days of drudgery can lie in store for visiting bowlers.</p> <p>The day's struggle was then compounded by the news that England's captain for this match, Stuart Broad, had required a scan on his left heel after the close. \"Stuart felt discomfort late on in today's play and has gone for a scan,\" said a statement from the ECB.</p> <p>Broad was among those who had been frustrated by Pujara, the young man who has taken over Rahul Dravid's coveted No3 spot in the Indian Test match lineup and immediately responded with a century against New Zealand in Hyderabad in August, to which he came within 13 runs of adding another, here against England. Shah is three years older at 27 and less celebrated, a fringe player in the Mumbai side, but until his batting partner pressed the accelerator late in the day against second- and third-string bowlers, as England tried to hustle their way towards a second new ball, he had matched him run for eked-out run and will resume the final day on 84, with Mumbai A 232 for four, still 113 behind England.</p> <p>In order to give their top order more time in the middle, England will be keen to dispose of the Mumbai innings with the second new ball, which is only one over old, and will certainly hope that the 9.30am start, while the hills are still hidden behind the morning mistiness, will offer them similar conditions to those that allowed the Mumbai seamers to swing the ball around quite alarmingly at times first thing on the second day.</p> <p>England had opted to bat on rather than declare at their overnight score and it was to little apparent avail, with only seven more runs coming in half an hour for the loss of three more wickets before Broad pulled the plug at 345 for nine.</p> <p>If England may appear to have missed a trick, however, then rather than take advantage of the potential movement themselves, they may have rationalised that they would discover more about the frustrations and demands of bowling on subcontinental pitches if they bided their time. In this they were not disappointed for the Mumbai batsmen, with intent rather than urgency, showed a capacity for batting time and constructing an innings at the expense of any expansiveness.</p> <p>Before Monty Panesar removed Pujara with a late strike, and Jimmy Anderson, with the second new ball, got rid of Surya Yadav with the day's final delivery, England had succeeded only in removing both openers, Bhavin Thakkar to Graham Onions after an excruciating 33 deliveries before he even made a run, and later the left-hander Shikhar Dhawan, who edged an off break from Joe Root to Anderson at slip as the ball turned and bounced out of some rough.</p> <p>Thereafter, until Pujara edged to Anderson at slip with four overs of the day remaining, it was hard graft for the bowlers, chances coming only when Panesar found the edge of Pujara's bat when on 22 \u2013 with the ball going fast, low but catchable past the left hand of Anderson at slip \u2013 and when Jonny Bairstow will swear blind (and probably did) that he had stumped Shah, then on 18, off the same bowler as the batsman overbalanced.</p> <p>England did not bowl badly and none of the main bowlers ever lost control. Largely they maintained their discipline throughout the day, making batting hard work. They could have made better use of the new ball, which required a fullish length, Broad erring a fraction too short. But thereafter, it was a matter of knuckling down, using attritional tactics, and, later on, some more adventurous field placings, such as the brace of short midwickets put in place as Anderson sought, but was disappointingly unable to find, the reverse swing that will be so important for England's success in the forthcoming series.</p> <p>To this end they will crave outfields less lush than that at the DY Patil Stadium. The steadiest of the bowlers was Panesar, who wheeled his way through 20 overs, trajectory habitually flat as is his norm, but still able to get remarkable energy on the ball. It was six years ago in this country that as a naive young bowler he made his Test debut at Nagpur and dismissed Sachin Tendulkar. He is a different fellow now on the field, in charge of his own destiny, setting his own fields with fastidious exactness, as he ought to have been allowed to do all along.</p>",
  "<p>An independent inquiry has called on the United Nations to investigate the \"systematic and widespread\" murder of political opponents by Ayatollah Khomeini's regime in Iran during the 1980s.</p> <p>In its judgment at the end of a three-day session in The Hague, <a href=\"http://www.irantribunal.com/Eng/EnHome.html\" title=\"\">the Iran tribunal</a> found that the Islamic regime had committed \"gross human rights abuses\" including torture, sexual violence, extra-judicial executions and unjust imprisonment.</p> <p>The ruling is the culmination of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/18/iran-tribunal-investigates-massacre\" title=\"\">five-year co-operation between international human rights lawyers, exiled Iranians and relatives of the victims</a>. As many as 20,000 people, mainly youths, are believed to have been killed in the state's prisons during that decade.</p> <p>The first stage of hearings took place in London this summer at Amnesty International's premises. About 75 witnesses, many surviving detainees, gave evidence \u2013 some in person, others via videolink.</p> <p>The final stage was held in the Peace Palace, home to the UN's international court of justice in The Hague. Proceedings were broadcast live online. The Iranian government was invited to participate but declined to reply or attend.</p> <p>The tribunal was based on the model developed by a private international war crimes tribunal established in 1966 by Bertrand Russell and Jean-Paul Sartre to investigate the US war record in Vietnam.</p> <p>In his closing speech, the British international lawyer Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, the tribunal's prosecutor, said the graves of the executed stretched \"as far as the eye can see; the gravedigger of Shiraz reported the delivery of 60 bodies on a single occasion, of victims at most 20 years old.</p> <p>\"Men were arrested at 10 in the morning and were dead by 11; entire families were eliminated and whole wards purged; rows of prisoners were shot by firing squad, still breathing until they were finished off by coup de gr\u00e2ce.\"</p> <p>One of the most chilling accounts was given by a man who admitted that as a child he was forced to shoot any survivors in the head. Nice added: \"Truckloads of bodies were tipped into mass graves \u2026 In no case was an execution ordered in accordance with due process.</p> <p>\"There has been not one witness who was not tortured in prison, both physically and mentally. Prisoners were hanged from the ceiling by their arms, flogged on the soles of their feet, beaten, deprived of sleep, kept in solitary confinement, subjected to mock executions and forced to watch other prisoners being tortured \u2013 or were tortured in the presence of their children.</p> <p>\"Shokufeh Sakhi told the tribunal how she was subjected to sensory deprivation in a dark box (the 'coffin') for hours on end, month after month. The general effect was to turn prisoners into zombies by destroying their senses of self and dignity.</p> <p>\"Another witness told the tribunal of the psychological rape that turned him into a puppet, who would shoot his fellow prisoners as member of a firing squad of <em>tavabeen</em> (repenters).\"</p> <p>Prisoners' families were forced to pay for the bullets used to shoot their loved ones and assaulted when they tried to hold mourning services, the tribunal heard. Gravestones were smashed; mothers were refused the right to recover their children's bodies.</p> <p>In its judgment, the Iran tribunal found that the Islamic Republic of Iran bears absolute responsibility for gross violations of human rights against its citizens and \"crimes against humanity under customary international law as applicable to Iran in the 1980s\".</p> <p>Among its recommendations, the tribunal called on the human rights council of the United Nations to establish a commission of inquiry to investigate \"these atrocities\".</p> <p>The tribunal was composed of six judges including the UK barrister Michael Mansfield QC, John Dugard, a South African professor of international law, and Professor Patricia Sellers, a former UN adviser on human rights.</p>",

But looking back I see that my own unstable upbringing was fundamental to becoming one. As I kid I went to 15 different schools. But I think what most influenced me was going to South Africa for my final year of high school. I won a rotary club scholarship to go there. I come from a very white, rural area of Australia and my family were pretty horrified that I decided to go.</p> <p>I'm not exactly sure why, but I've always been driven by social justice issues. I went to South Africa in 1992, it was the first year that black students were allowed into white South African schools. I was a kid of 16 or 17 and I saw things as very black and white \u2013 I didn't understand there were also many shades of grey and South Africa opened me up to the complexities of a country's and a community's problems.</p> <p>This was my first introduction to the concept of global citizenship. The family I stayed with were white. They were really loving people and who we would call their \"servants\" were seen as part of their family. They looked after their servants' family members and educated their children. It made me realise that people aren't necessarily bad even if they do hold views I don't agree with. It was also one of the first years that white students were taught about apartheid. I found it unbelievable that a girl from rural Australia would know more about black history and the policies of apartheid than my contemporaries who actually lived in the country. This really opened my eyes to ideas of how you shouldn't necessarily believe everything you read in the papers. I realised everything was more complex than I'd thought.</p> <p>I did a degree in youth work. I was very idealistic and I really wanted to help young people make something of themselves. I was really helped by the principal from my high school, <a href=\"http://www.emeraldsc.vic.edu.au/\">Emerald Secondary College</a> in the town of Emerald, Treva McGregor. He is still my mentor now. He was such a great down to earth bloke who always believed in spending time with you personally. I had a really bad stutter at school. I could barely say my name at high school. I did consider jobs that didn't involve speaking but none of them would have been right for me at all. But Treva really believed in me and that made such a difference to my life.</p> <p>Towards the end of my degree I realised I wanted to work in schools with young people. I didn't actually want to be a teacher at that time but you needed a teaching background to be a welfare officer, so I did my teaching qualification. I tried to persuade my university that I didn't need to do my teaching practice because I'd done so much youth work, but really it was because I was terrified of being in front of a class with my stutter. Of course they (quite rightly) made me do it.</p> <p>One of my teaching practices was at Lakeside Secondary School, an inner city school in Melbourne with a high ethnic makeup. It was such a tough school I swore I'd never go back but this was a time when teaching jobs were scarce in Australia and I ended up being offered a job teaching history there.</p> <p>Australia was quite behind the times in those days, especially in how you support kids with English as a second language. In some ways, I just put in the hours. It wasn't until I came to teach in England that I became more accountable in my practice. I think I really learned my teaching skills in England.</p> <p>But before I came to England to teach I spent an eye-opening year in Papua New Guinea on an Australian Volunteers International programme, which is a bit like VSO. People from the UK think of Papua New Guinea as a paradise but Australians don't think that at all and only go there for mining. It's got terrible problems with violence against women. I wanted to understand more about the issues there. Being in Papua New Guinea really made me realise how different people can perceive the world and events. I love the quote \"One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter\" and discovered the truth of that in Papua New Guinea. I was astonished to find highly educated students who believed in curses and voodoo. It made me really reflect on how people can see the world in a completely different way, it was a powerful lesson.</p> <p>Then I came to England and got a job teaching citizenship in Manchester at <a href=\"http://www.reddish.stockport.sch.uk/\">Reddish Vale secondary school</a> and later in <a href=\"http://www.salfordcity-academy.org/\">Salford City Academy</a>. This was in the very early days of citizenship education, so it was a really exciting time.</p> <p>I realised citizenship was a subject I was absolutely passionate about. Not just teaching the facts, but teaching the skills and critical thinking behind global issues. One lesson I got a class year 10 kids to believe there was a tribe of Aboriginal mermaids in Tasmania. The kids were enthralled and went off with the homework of creating a timeline of the tribe, I told them to research it using Google.</p> <p>The next day they came back and said: \"They don't exist miss!\" We talked about how we don't typically question authority. They believed me because I'm from Australia and I seemed a valid source of information. It was a very powerful lesson. I want my students to challenge the things they hear on the news, or hear their families say - and even challenge what I say as their teacher.</p> <p>Citizenship is about helping students get to the bottom of the difficult questions. I was teaching at the time of the London bombs and there were lots of controversial questions that needed to be asked and difficult discussions to have. What better place to discuss these uncomfortable issues than in a citizenship classroom?</p> <p>I honestly believe you need to show your human side as a teacher. You earn respect as a teacher, you don't just get it. I would stutter in class but because I had a relationship with the students I found that if one of them teased me, before I knew it the other kids would be telling that kid off. The students saw me as a person, they got to see me fail, they got to see me grow. When I left England my students said they were proud of me. They said \"Miss, when you came here you couldn't speak \u2013 look at you now \u2013 you can't stop talking!\"</p> <p>If students are going to develop as global citizens they have to be able to question global issues. They have to find out about power balances and be actively involved in asking questions. It's so important not to just be taught about tragedies overseas and then to disconnect from that as it seems nothing to do with your life. I don't like citizenship to be purely about fundraising, I find that a very submissive way of dealing with an issue. When you humanise the stories then you start to make inroads. I think having these experiences overseas can help and I would certainly encourage my students to spend time in other countries. Teachers can also bring people into their classrooms who can tell their story. For me the questions started flowing when I went to South Africa and they've never stopped.</p> <p>I've been back in Australia since last January. I'm working with people who have been marginalised by their community and don't want to vote or or think they can't \u2013 and voting is actually compulsory in Australia. It's a combination of my citizenship teaching skills and community work. I actually think it's a great idea to have compulsory voting, it requires you to think about what you want for your community.</p> <p>I would like to get more involved in citizenship education here but I'm not quite sure whether to go back into classroom teaching, at the moment anyway. Citizenship has just become part of the new national curriculum which is being developed in Australia at the moment.</p> <p>But the thing is teaching takes over your life; it's not a job, it's a bloody way of life. As all teachers know, it doesn't stop. I'm really enjoying combining teaching with community work at the moment.</p> <p><em>Billy Crombie trained and worked as a teacher in Australia.

  "<p>The problem with a trained owl bringing you a wedding ring, one might think, is that if the bird panics and pecks out a bridesmaid's eye, this could really take the shine off the reception.</p> <p>Nevertheless, according to the <a href=\"http://www.chpublishing.co.uk/product.asp?id=2398029\" title=\"\"><em>Church Weddings Handbook </em></a>(a new Church of England guide, based on a five-year study), many couples are keen to have their rings delivered by strigiformes. We can only hope, as the bridegroom demonstrates his confidence that the safest place for his wedding jewellery is in the beak of a wild animal, that the best man isn't too offended.</p> <p>The handbook recommends that vicars be more flexible about personalised ceremonies. Other modern ideas, alongside the avian ring twist, include arriving at church on horseback and walking down the aisle to the theme from <em>Test Match Special</em>.</p> <p>The recommendations are \"dynamite\", according to the Archbishop of York, who is clearly a cricket fan.</p> <p>You may wonder why a couple would choose to get married in church, then fill it with performing animals. After all, these days, you can just get married at the zoo.</p> <p>The five-year survey dispelled the myth that people marry in church for the sake of a pretty building. In his foreword to the handbook, the Venerable John Barton explains: \"The prime reason is an inner desire to do things properly and to take marriage seriously. It is for [priests] to sense in this a genuine yearning for God's blessing.\"</p> <p>If people want to \"do things properly\", you might ask, then why don't they just opt in to the exact traditional formula?</p> <p>Why fiddle with the historic and agreed ritual that is half the comfort of having a temple (any temple) to turn to at times of birth, marriage and death?</p> <p>The answer is hidden elsewhere in the Ven John Barton's essay, in his passing line: \"Brides-to-be spend hours studying wedding magazines.\"</p> <p>There's your answer.<em>Wedding magazines</em>. I've had cause to read a few of those recently; they are absolutely terrifying. Their wacky suggestions could form the basis of anxiety dreams for years to come.</p> <p>No disrespect to the editors and writers, who are doubtless kind and well-meaning people, but there is an inherent danger in the business model.</p> <p>For the buyer, this is a one-off purchase. No wedding magazine is ever going to lure lifelong subscribers, especially now Elizabeth Taylor's dead. There's no reason why they shouldn't be exactly the same every month: checklist of pre-wedding admin, planning timetable, directory of stockists. The magazine buyer would never know this is repeat material, since (fingers crossed) she'll never need to read one again.</p> <p>But this does not apply to those who work in the wedding industry. It is natural for businesses to devise innovations, and natural for genre magazine staff to be excited by them \u2013 especially with advertisers to please.</p> <p>So, when the time comes for your one-off purchase of bridal advice, you will find the magazines are light years ahead of you, filled with twists you didn't know you needed.</p> <p>This month's <em>You and Your Wedding</em>, for example, asks the question: \"What's hot in wedding biscuits right now?\"</p> <p>(The answer is \"Save the Date favours\". That is: icing the date on a biscuit and posting it to guests as a first announcement. What a triple whammy for the nervous bride: you're supposed to invite people twice, you're supposed to do it in an interesting way, and you're supposed to know about the latest trend in \"wedding biscuits\".)</p> <p>The current <em>Wedding Venues &amp; Services</em> asks the bride what she has planned for \"table entertainment and props\", recommending a \"personalised funfair heart (\u00a3145)\" for the latter and a music-themed trivia game for the former. Heaven help the poor fool who imagined the \"table entertainment\" would be a meal and the \"props\" some form of cutlery.</p> <p>Other magazines make suggestions for \"your going-home presents\", \"your seating-card novelties\" and \"your customised napkins\" \u2013 and that's before you graduate to the more specific publications <em>Wedding Flowers</em> and <em>Wedding Cakes</em>.</p> <p>Now imagine this bride, filled with (as John Barton says), an \"inner desire to do things properly\". The loud message, broadcast directly from these authoritative voices to her nervous and suggestible little heart, is that her wedding is supposed to be original, creative and different from everyone else's. Anxious to get everything right, no wonder she starts desperately planning to canter down the aisle on a zebra, throwing monogrammed hats at the congregation to the strains of \"I Don't Feel Like Dancing\".</p> <p>A strange paradox is at work: if your instinct is to be normal, the magazines imply, then you must express that in the form of making a dozen weird innovations. It may well be that the best thing a kindly vicar can do, as he counsels a couple before marriage, is give them permission to do things in an ordinary, traditional way.</p> <p>But there is a deeper message to the <em>Church Weddings Handbook</em>, about a much bigger sort of flexibility. It's not really about feathered ring-bearers; it's about inviting people to feel confident and at home in church. Consciously or not, the Church of England is showing that difference is not to be rejected; that it's possible to be both different and the same. There is a lot of hope here, for the future.</p> <p>Many people have gone shyly to the local church to ask for marriage with a patchy attendance record or an unconventional background; because they were brought up without religion, or differently from their partners, but they yearned to receive God's blessing and our national church has a unique ability to offer it in a simple, supple way. It's hard to express the power of that gentle, uncritical welcome, other than to say that one of my prayers is that gay couples will feel it too, within my lifetime.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.victoriacoren.com/\" title=\"\"><em>www.victoriacoren.com</em></a></p>",
  "<p>For the second time in two years, Sir Edward Heath's old house, the grade II listed <a href=\"http://www.arundells.org/\" title=\"\">Arundells</a>, has been closed to the public, with the aim of selling it off. This is in complete defiance of his wishes. Although he lived in the place for no more than 20 of his 89 years, two decades out of the roughly four he dedicated to sulking, Heath's will was dedicated to keeping the place open, along with its outstanding collection of nautical doodads, as a personal shrine. A charitable trust was set up to do this. If some question the philanthropic benefits of a Heath memorial, the precedent may encourage all those who hope, for instance, to see John Prescott's famous downstairs lavatory, defiantly redecorated by Pauline during the couple's time of trouble, or to touch the actual elephant lamps that landed the Goves in so much grief. In Heath's case, there is neither the cash nor the visitors to keep going. The National Trust has said it would not take it on for less than \u00a38m.</p> <p>Rather touchingly, given Heath's incredible unpopularity even within his own party, and his friendly associations with mass murderers and tyrants, the trust's decision to sell up and spend the remaining money on charitable activities has elicited some passionate defences of the Arundells legacy. On the <em>Daily Telegraph </em>letters page, one writer has called the closure a \"tragedy\".</p> <p>Wisely, Heath's supporters have accepted that the posthumous discomfiture of a widely detested man may not be the most persuasive argument in their armoury. Rather, they invoke national heritage and the tragedy of losing any of it, even the fraction that Ted Heath refurbed. \"How harshly History would have judged the Churchill family if they had succeeded in selling <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/chartwell/\" title=\"\">Chartwell</a> which is now an iconic piece of our heritage,\" caution the Friends of Arundells, a group dedicated to saving the house. Like Chartwell, the Friends say, Arundells provides \"a means of assuaging our curiosity as to how powerful and influential people lived\". Even with the house closed, the illustrated <a href=\"http://www.arundells.org/\" title=\"\">Arundells website </a>remains a great curiosity assuager, at the same time that it prompts questions that must remain forever unanswered. Was this upmarket version of dictator style copied by Heath from his important friends or was Heath, on the contrary, the original model for all the chandeliers and illuminated display cabinets, the gilt, marble and column -mounted busts favoured by tyrants the world over? Do the knickerish festoon blinds and entrail pinks of the dining room tell us anything significant about a man famous for his staggering rudeness to women? How often did Heath play his grand piano, when the top was littered with silver-framed photographs of his smirking self adjacent to one famous scoundrel or another? And how can the preservation of this vainglorious tat, in a house that could easily find a buyer, conceivably be passed off as a worthwhile charitable project?</p> <p>It will certainly have enhanced Heath's claims on posterity, that, after cunningly wresting its ownership from the Cathedral, he invested in the kind of listed, historic property that, unlike Mrs Thatcher's executive home in Dulwich, immediately entitles the owner to proclaim oneself a custodian of the nation's heritage. Even when these houses are permanently closed to the public, their owners, if the <a href=\"http://www.hha.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Historic House Association </a>is any guide, are likely to consider their costly maintenance or \"stewardship\" enough reason for tax breaks and subsidies not available to the struggling owners of uglier, newer or nonexistent properties. Have pity, for instance, on historic house owners who now dread a mansion tax on properties they can barely afford to run as it is. \"In the past 10 years or so one in eight such houses has had to sell works of art \u2013 often abroad \u2013 to help finance major repairs,\" the HHA president wrote to the <em>Telegraph</em>, as if daring readers not to laugh. How many stewards of non-historic houses have sacrificed as much?</p> <p>Thanks, above all, to the National Trust, since it made sheltered housing for feckless aristocrats its publicly funded mission, the British have become remarkably tolerant about appeals for help from unimaginably wealthy homeowners, as well as fantastically sentimental about celebrity homes. While Heath's supporters fight for the right of Arundells and its hideous paint-jobs to rank alongside Salisbury Cathedral, friends of the great travel writer, Patrick Leigh-Fermor, are agitating to save his villa in Greece and, closer to home, friends of Ringo Starr are celebrating a reprieve from demolition \u2013 in the face of an indifferent National Trust \u2013 of the notable drummer's birthplace.</p> <p>If Ringo fans were unmoved by the argument that he only lived at 9 Madryn Street for three months, and some time before his immortal Octopus's Garden, there could be no better testament to the trust's amazing success in persuading the public of the power of furnished property, no matter how vulgar, artificial or otherwise unprepossessing, to connect visitors with the past. Even when a house does not, in the words of James Lees-Milne, the saviour of strapped aristocrats, breathe \"that ineffable spirit essential to the legendary purpose of the country house\", the National Trust experience is intended to take you back. \"Imagine walking into the kitchen where John's Aunt Mimi would have cooked him his tea,\" it urges visitors to John Lennon's house. At 18th-century Shugborough, where the latest Lord Lichfield is presumably breathing his ineffable spirit out of sight of the paying public, it suggests that the animistically inclined \"try out the beds in the new servants' bedroom\" (check first, house closed October-March).</p> <p>On this basis, maybe the Friends of Arundells have a point. In comparison with the trust's circumscribed invitations to bounce on the reconstructed beds of imaginary skivvies, the chance to imagine oneself as a solitary Sir Edward, engaged, say, in his favourite hobby of scrawling abusive marginalia on an unflattering biography, is positively enticing. Now that the trust has democratised, as it had to, the credentials for a building's preservation, almost no house, and certainly no famous person's house, can be disrespected as built heritage. With the Lennon and McCartney homes now official, publicly funded historic destinations, it is understandable that Heath and Leigh-Fermor should have thought that their respective houses, stuffed with authentic kit and only recently vacated, were legacies equally deserving of support.</p> <p>Had they not coincided with national bankruptcy, civil unrest, grievous public suffering and pleas from Greek archeologists for help in saving their country's classical heritage from ruin, current efforts to transform Leigh-Fermor's Peloponnese home into a permanent writers' retreat might have looked quite normal, proportionate and not even a curious way to celebrate a celebrated nomad. Instead, thrown into Greek relief, the British determination to preserve certain, arbitrarily selected homes from estate agents is exposed for what it often is: excruciatingly poor taste.</p>",
  "<p>He is revered as the last true rock god and his band, Nirvana, created the soundtrack for the alienated grunge generation. So now, nearly two decades after Kurt Cobain's death in April 1994 at the age of 27, is it time for \"Kurt: The Musical\"?</p> <p>Certainly not, according to Cobain's combative widow, Courtney Love. Suggestions that a Nirvana musical could be in the works \u2013 masterminded by Love's sometime co-manager, Sam Lufti, and going ahead with her blessing \u2013 have led the singer-actress to come out swinging. \"There will be no musical,\" she told the <em>Observer</em>. \"Sometimes it's best just to leave things alone.\"</p> <p>Rumours that Lufti was working on a Broadway musical which would tell the story of Love's life with Cobain have coincided with reports of a new CBS sitcom entitled <em>Smells Like Teen Spirit</em>, and the auctioning of a smashed bass guitar <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTWKbfoikeg\" title=\"\">from the original Smells Like Teen Spirit video</a>. Love, and many Nirvana fans, fear the commercialisation of Cobain may be getting out of hand.</p> <p>The temperamental Love \u2013 who had grunge hits with Doll Parts and Celebrity Skin and starred in Milos Forman's <em>The People vs. Larry Flynt</em> \u2013 says that while she has been in discussions with the director of <em>The Kid Stays In the Picture</em>, Brett Morgan, over a film looking at her life since Cobain, she is opposed to commerical exploitation of his legacy.</p> <p>\"I said yes once \u2013 to Baz Luhrmann to use eight seconds of Smells Like Teen Spirit in <em>Moulin Rouge</em>. But he wasn't allowed to use it in the marketing. I didn't get the part in the film. I was so pissed off I made up the term to 'Baz' somebody.\"</p> <p>Love recently gave up some rights to Cobain's likeness and Nirvana's publishing but, contrary to recent reports, the singer says she has not ceded control of rights to their daughter, Frances Bean, saying: \"She doesn't have anything to do with it.\"</p> <p>Nirvana may now be a distant and glorious rock memory, said Love. But that does not mean the authenticity and rebel spirit of the man and the band are now fair game for profit-making schemes. \"Ryan Adams said something profound: 'Every time I play my guitar for money, and every time I play my guitar to get laid, I lose a little of my mojo.'\"</p> <p>Protection of the Cobain legacy explains why Love <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/16/jack-black-courtney-love-muppets\" title=\"\">condemned Disney's use of Smells Like Teen Spirit </a>in a <em>Muppets</em> episode that cast Nirvana as Queen from their Bohemian Rhapsody era.</p> <p>Love says she considered suing the entertainment giant but was dissuaded by her manager. \"What the fuck's with the Muppets? I happen to like Elmo and I think the Cookie Monster is interesting but I know him [Kurt] and I know he didn't want to be a Muppet. It was a disgrace. Like pissing on a grave.\"</p> <p>The CBS sitcom <em>Smells Like Teen Spirit</em> has been created by Dave Goetsch, the writer behind <em>The Big Bang Theory</em> and <em>3rd Rock From the Sun</em>. According to the <em>Hollywood Reporter</em>, the show will follow the foibles of an 18-year-old who drops out of university to launch a multibillion-dollar internet company from his garage with the assistance of his sister and his well-meaning but out-of-touch, grunge-loving parents.</p> <p>A Nirvana musical would undoubtedly offer rich commercial pickings. Abba are estimated to have madeup to $6bn (\u00a33.75bn) from <em>Mamma Mia!</em> \u2013 far more than they made during the lifetime of the group. The genre worked for the LA hair band musical <em>Rock of Ages </em>and it worked for <em>Jersey Boys,</em> about Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, which has made $2bn worldwide.</p> <p>But some investors in the Nirvana catalogue have found the music is largely too hard-edged to be useful in a commercial context, although a staged version offers some control.</p> <p>\"It all comes down to how intelligent and cool the work is,\" says former manager of Smashing Pumpkins Andy Gershon. \"It's possible to do a successful grunge musical, but you'd have to find a great story to tell.\"</p> <p>According to Love, that story is not going to be the tumultuous, star-crossed relationship between Kurt and Courtney. She says her policy is now to keep as much control as she can. \"I got so bullied into selling what I sold. I regret it so much. I'm never selling the rest of it.\"Love herself has recently branched out into fashion with a label called Never The Bride, selling the distressed baby doll looks of her youth. But she's not about to abandon music. The British label Wichita is about to release a new Courtney Love single. \"It's called This is War. It's two minutes, 59 seconds,\" she says. \"It's the best song I've written in my life.\"</p>",
  "<p>There's an old joke, currently being aimed at Marks &amp; Spencer's platitude-loving boss Marc Bolland, that he could talk in clich\u00e9s until the cows come&#xa0;home.</p> <p>To be fair to the Dutchman, he is hardly the only culprit in a sector riddled with soundbites that get more outings than Twiggy in an M&amp;S commercial, and one particular favourite goes: \"Top line is vanity, bottom line is sanity.\"</p> <p>If that piece of advice were ever true, then it would be fair to say that the chasing of revenues from overseas is viewed as very vainglorious \u2013 which might be the only explanation for why the retailer's alighted on it.</p> <p>Bolland \u2013 who has acquired the nickname of \"five minutes late\", on account of his schedule frequently being thrown by pauses to perfect his coiffure \u2013 plans to more than double the pace of M&amp;S's overseas openings. This eyecatching strategy comes despite his struggles to reverse woes at home \u2013 and this week the group is expected to report a drop in first-half profits following the biggest decline in non-food revenue since 2008.</p> <p>So with that backdrop, can a plan to sell lingerie to Parisians \u2013 the equivalent of a French merchant peddling towelling pyjamas here \u2013 be the clever answer? Sanity it may not prove to be.</p> <h2>Economists \u2013 right on the money again</h2> <p>Our nation's clairvoyant economists have been telling us for months how November's gathering of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee would be the moment when the printing presses belched magic money once more. \"There is a growing expectation the Bank will sanction more quantitative easing in November,\" Chris Williamson of Markit said only last month, just as Martin Beck of Capital Economics mused: \"We still expect more asset purchases \u2026 in November.\"</p> <p>That no longer represents the consensus, however, which has shifted to Threadneedle Street giving the whole QE thing a miss at this week's meet. The dismal scientists have settled on this latest take having been permitted a look at the less dovish tone of the October minutes, while also being taken by surprise by UK GDP leaping by 1% in the third quarter.</p> <p>Added to all that, there already appears to be a lot of free money stimulating the economy, courtesy of those high-street banks caught fleecing customers via payment protection insurance. Provisions stand at more than \u00a312bn and are likely to rise \u2013 which might prove socially useful. Or, as an economist might hedge, it might not.</p> <h2>Experian reveals its own credit check</h2> <p>Credit where credit is due: Experian is one of the few companies that can convincingly claim to be having a good financial crisis. While its former sister company Home Retail Group continues to flounder, the other business spun out of the old retailing conglomerate Great Universal Stores just seems to boom and boom.</p> <p>Experian shares have risen almost fourfold since the autumn of 2008 as the company, best known for helping banks check consumer credit histories, has grown in North and Latin America. It also turns out it's been making a tidy return from the public sector too, after being hired by the British government to cut benefit fraud: Experian gets a bounty for every suspected cheat grassed up.</p> <p>Still, the scenario gets flipped this week when the company has to divulge details of its own finances, as it reports interim results. Much of the focus will be on its decision to acquire another 29.6% of a Brazilian credit agency for $1.5bn (\u00a3935m) and take its holding to 99.6% \u2013 a purchase that will be funded from existing banking facilities.</p> <p>While that looks like a debt that can be quickly repaid, analysts at Seymour Pierce caution it will take leverage towards \"the top end of the target range\". That must irk: it sounds suspiciously like a credit check.</p> <h2>Ryanair: where the customer is always wrong</h2> <p>Another week, another public spat between Ryanair and one of its customers. Footage of a passenger being ejected by the Spanish rozzers from a flight last week is doing the rounds online - after the airline apparently insisted she be removed from the plane for boarding with, er, a poster poking out of the top of her carrier bag.</p> <p>These things always appear embarrassing, but chief exec Michael O'Leary has form in profiting from such rows. In 2002, he memorably refused to settle with Ryanair's millionth passenger, Jane O'Keeffe, who trousered \u20ac67,500 after taking the airline to court for reneging on its offer to give her free flights for life.</p> <p>Bad news for O'Leary? Don't be silly. \"For three days we got the worst publicity any company has ever had in its life,\" he recalled. \"Our bookings soared by 30% day by day by day.\"</p> <p>This week Ryanair reports interim results. You've guessed it: net profits are expected to rise by around 10%.</p>",
  "<p>A new law to stop councils using counter-terrorism powers to snoop on people is thwarting efforts to tackle noisy neighbours, according to environmental health experts.</p> <p>The Protection of Freedoms Act, which became law last Thursday, was introduced in response to concerns that local authorities were misusing the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) to mount surveillance and investigation operations.</p> <p>Revelations that councils had spied on homeowners putting out their bins and parents flouting school catchment area regulations prompted widespread concerns that Ripa, which was primarily intended as an anti-terrorism measure, was being exploited.</p> <p>The new act means councils must now apply to a magistrate before they can launch surveillance operations. According to the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health (CIEH), that means that monitoring sound levels without the consent of the householder concerned will have to be approved by a magistrate after a fee has been paid. It claims that Home Office officials have admitted that \"some\" noise pollution investigations will be subject to the new law.</p> <p>\"The new law is going to go one of two ways,\" said Howard Price, principal policy officer with the CIEH. \"Either local authorities will stop investigating complaints or they will ignore Ripa, which is not satisfactory. We don't like to ignore the law. It's not a good position for public bodies to be in.\"</p> <p>The institute claims the act was introduced in a hurry and will protect the freedoms of noise-makers at the expense of householders who want a peaceful night's sleep. It said the \"additional controls are neither justified nor in the public interest\", and pointed out that last year the Home Office minister James Brokenshire admitted to parliament that there was no evidence that noise investigations were being carried out inappropriately.</p> <p>Noise is the largest cause of complaints to local authorities. As many as 450,000 complaints are investigated each year by councils. Neighbour noise complaints comprise around two thirds of the total.</p> <p>The Home Office insists the new laws apply only when public authorities obtain private information covertly, when it is necessary, proportionate and in line with people's right to privacy. As a result it believes noise pollution investigations will usually fall outside the scope of the act.</p>",
  "<p>Jiang Xingsan's day job is helping to run a vast agricultural group, the All-China Federation of Supply and Manufacturing Co-operatives, which serves millions of farmers across China, and has increased its payroll by 200,000 in the past year alone. But he was in Manchester last week, paying tribute to the Rochdale Pioneers.</p> <p>\"I'm especially proud to come to Manchester, because this city was the birthplace for co-operatives,\" he says. When the so-called Rochdale Equitable Pioneers Society set up shop in 1844, promising good quality food at fair prices, and a share of the profits for their customers, they couldn't have known that their big idea would spread around the world.</p> <p>More than 7,000 people, from 90 countries, gathered at the vast Manchester Central venue for \"Co-operatives 2012\" \u2013 part trade-show, part conference, part jamboree and the culmination of a UN-backed \"Year of Co-operatives\".</p> <p>Namibian weavers, Canadian bankers and Malaysian tour guides gathered with just one thing in common \u2013 their business model. Instead of being owned by shareholders, who extract a slice of the profits, all these co-operatives hand over any gains they make to their customers and staff.</p> <p>Before the credit crunch, co-ops were easily dismissed as worthy but irrelevant. But the crisis, and the failure of many developed economies to generate a sustainable recovery, have raised public interest in alternative ways of doing business. In total, co-operatives worldwide now have a billion members.</p> <p>\"There's more of a spring in our step now,\" says Ed Mayo, general secretary of trade body Co-operatives UK. \"We have emerged from the crisis still holding trust.\" Dame Pauline Green, who leads the International Co-operative Alliance, told the delegates last week: \"We know that co-operative banks, and credit unions, have not collapsed; they are not in receipt of taxpayer bailouts. Our arguments have begun to find traction with global decision-makers on the back of the sustainability and resilience of our financial model over the past five years.\"</p> <p>Mayo has been appointed by David Cameron as a mutuals ambassador, to spread the word: and he says the argument is a much broader one than whether co-operatives are more ethical than their rapacious corporate rivals.</p> <p>\"There's a big story here: not just about responding to the credit crunch, but how the UK economy could be more productive and inclusive if it moves significantly towards a co-operative model,\" he says.</p> <p>Much of the movement's energy in the past year has been directed at persuading the government to commit to bringing together all the legislation affecting co-operatives in one so-called Consolidation Act, as previous governments did for charities and company law.</p> <p>Cameron has promised a Co-operatives Act by 2015, and the Law Commission has been given the job of doing the technical groundwork. \"Our vision is it should be as easy and natural to set up a co-operative as it is to set up a shareholder-owned business,\" says Mayo.</p> <p>Peter Kimotho, who works on promoting co-operatives for the Kenyan government, also extols the wider benefits \u2013 beyond ethics \u2013 of a co-operative.</p> <p>\"We have a co-operative development policy in Kenya,\" he says, explaining that a network of co-operatives offers credit to farmers, and helps them to bring their products to market. \"That way, even small-scale producers are able to benefit from economies of scale.\" In total, Kenyan co-operatives have 10 million members \u2013 one in four of the population.</p> <p>\"The co-operative model is better because it empowers the small-scale producer; and in terms of decision-making, it's the policy of one man, one vote.\"</p> <p>Some of the co-operatives represented are on a mind-boggling scale: the giant Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative sells to 55 million farmers, who belong to 40,000 co-operatives. Its boss, GN Saxena, says they trust IFFCO not to hoodwink its clients. \"We do not play with the market. When there's a shortage of fertiliser, we make it available at the right price. We don't play with the quality or quantity.\" More importantly, though, every co-op member has been paid a dividend, every year since 1975.</p> <p>In the UK, Peter Marks, chief executive of the Co-operative Group, which co-sponsored last week's conference, and is trebling the size of its banking arm by buying more than 600 branches from Lloyds, as well as expanding rapidly into legal services, says the co-operative movement is enjoying a renaissance.</p> <p>\"I have been with the company for 45&#xa0;years, and for most of that time the Co-op was in steady decline. When I joined, we had 25% of the food market; a few years ago it was just 4%.\" When the idea of Co-op buying the Lloyds branches was first mooted, its governance was criticised, with commentators pointing out that it has, for example, a Methodist minister on its board, which is chosen by ordinary members. But Marks is unashamed of its democratic structure. \"My board is full of ordinary people \u2013 they're risk averse. Perhaps if Barclays and RBS had Methodist ministers on their board, they wouldn't be where they are now.\"</p>",
  "<p>My favourite James Bond opening sequence occurred in <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0070328/\" title=\"\"><em>Live and Let Die</em></a>, which marked the debut of Roger Moore in the role. In it, we see a chap in a soft hat and grey suit (who is later revealed to be a British spy) watching a doleful New Orleans funeral procession led by a brass band. Soon, he is joined by a dapper wee bloke who looks like a Caribbean version of the shopkeeper character in <em>Mr Benn</em>. \"Whose funeral is it?\" asks the agent. \"Yours,\" says the shopkeeper and duly sinks a flick knife right into the Brit's ribs.</p> <p>Without breaking stride, the coffin-bearers move over to the prone spy and cover him with the casket. Whereupon the band breaks into a joyous Dixieland bacchanal and gaily clad dudes in jumpsuits and carrying parasols start leaping about in a manner that makes you think of the peerless Antonio Fargas as Huggy Bear in <em>Starsky and Hutch</em>.</p> <p>I am often left feeling undermined when I read reviews by film critics. For that is when I discover that I have completely missed all the nuances, symbolism and sly references to other movies. I may have thought I'd simply been watching a high adventure film with some decent action, a fleeting slice of carnality, some loss and redemption and a rollercoaster finale. My favourite film critic, though, will often have observed Shakespearean motifs running all the way through it. Sometimes, she will say that it is the work of an \"auteur\" at the top of his game and who has channelled Hitchcock or Kubrick and I am left feeling like a two-dimensional oik once more. Sometimes, in the middle of a film, and for no apparent reason, a runaway pram with baby is seen careering down some steps. And while I'm trying to deduce the relevance of this, everyone else is whispering <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015648/\" title=\"\"><em>Battleship Potemkin</em></a> to each other and nodding sagely.</p> <p>These are the same people who look at me with barely concealed contempt when I tell them that my favourite Bond is, and always will be, Roger Moore. This is a man who could bend the bones in a marquise's basque simply by cocking his eyebrow. Even after watching the estimable Daniel Craig in the latest film in the Bond franchise the other night, I still cling to the view that Moore remains the ultimate Bond and that <em>Live and Let Die</em> was his finest moment. Nevertheless, I enjoyed <em>Skyfall</em>. Daniel Craig is a fine 007, though obviously lacking the elegance of Moore.</p> <p>For once, though, and perhaps because <em>Skyfall</em> takes us back to Bond's Scottish roots, on departing the cinema I was left pondering something quite profound and pertinent to the conversation I've been having with myself about the prospect of an independent Scotland. And it is this: what would an independent Scotland's intelligence agency look like and what attributes would we seek in our own James Bond? And anybody who thinks that we won't need our own SAS or MI6 must also believe that we will be able simply to drive those nasty Trident submarines down the Clyde before handing them over to the English navy near Arran.</p> <p>Indeed, the first covert mission of Jimmy Bond could be to find a responsible buyer for the nukes and then have them shipped to the new owners while the English aren't looking. Afterwards, we could say they were stolen by those mad bastards at the CIA. Even though independent Scotland would be one of the most placid and friendly nations on Earth, there would still be plenty of foreign opportunists eager to take advantage of our good nature and who would require to be sorted out rapid. These would include recalcitrant Spanish trawlermen trying to steal our fish and rapacious Chinese and Japanese distillers keen to muscle in on the Scotch whisky trade. All the while, we would have to keep an eye on the English secret service as it would be forever hatching vile stratagems to destabilise the new Scotland and bring us back under its rule.</p> <p>I would urge our first minister, Alex Salmond, to give this some urgent thought and to help him focus I now submit an early application to be an agent of Scotia's secret service.</p> <p><strong>Dear first minister,</strong></p> <p>I wish to apply for the post of secret agent in the new independent Scotland as I feel I possess some of the attributes required. I'm no stranger to foreign travel and in recent years have been to Barcelona, Lisbon, London, Copenhagen and Munich watching my football club losing matches in the Champions League.</p> <p>On duty, I would never drink more than the Scottish government's newly recommended weekly alcohol allowance of two American cream sodas and a Diet Coke. I would always carry lots of consent forms indemnifying you from action if I breached any foreign country's health and safety rules. If forced to seek the companionship of exotic ladies for the purposes of keeping one step ahead of the authorities, I would deploy my Glaswegian charm and language skills to gain their confidence: \"Vous etes un vision pour les yeux maladies, ma cherie.\" But I am familiar with Holyrood guidelines governing relations in situations such as these: respect, inclusiveness and diversity.</p> <p>If a situation called for physical confrontation, I would deploy non-lethal means to incapacitate any enemies of the Scottish state in accordance with our Holyrood hate crime legislation. Rather than exploding pens and poisonous tablets, I would prefer the half-brick or broken bottle, each of which can be deployed with prejudice but in a non-life-threatening manner. At all times, there would be measurable outcomes and I would always adhere to European procurement laws.</p> <p>Finally, first minister, I would remind you that Scots established the navies of <a href=\"http://www.scottish-american.net/john-paul-jones-founder-american-navy.html\" title=\"\">America</a> and Argentina. We also founded the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Stirling\" title=\"\">SAS</a>. We have a long and vivid hinterland when it comes to geopolitical aggravation. Can I suggest that, instead of the rather bumptious \"Who dares wins\" motto of England's overrated and boutique special forces, Scotland's could be the more legally defensible \"Haud me back!\"?</p> <p>Yours Aye</p>",
  "<p>When David Montgomery founded Mecom 12 years ago, in a shrewdly timed effort to merge and cut costs on newspapers across northern Europe, he was treated as some kind of Ulster Dracula, out to drain the life from an apprehensive, family-based press. Now, post-Mecom, he seems to be playing marriage broker between two chunky British local newspaper groups \u2013 Northcliffe and Iliffe \u2013 with some of our biggest regional operators taking a keen interest. Here, perhaps, comes Local World, a consolidating way of rescuing hundreds upon hundreds of struggling local papers. It isn't a done deal yet, after many months of secret negotiating. Nor is quite clear where Montgomery (mover or shaker?) fits into the picture. Nevertheless, almost incredibly, he seems hailed as saviour now. Share prices rise when he knocks on the door.</p> <p>The assumption is that putting groups together, imposing cost-control policies more coherently, can turn a losing business into a winner. Here, perhaps, comes a definitive nationwide website that can move the hundreds of locally based ad sales people print employs into a new age. The belief is that, at long last, local papers can get together to save themselves.</p> <p>But don't get too euphoric too soon. British local papers are already far leaner, going on anorexic, than the European family ownerships Montgomery tried to cut down to a profitable size. More, the necessity for amalgamations doesn't seem to have dawned in Competition Commission circles yet. Government policy, as so often in media matters, is years off the pace. Saviours can come unstuck in an instant.</p> <p>But there is one central point here as you examine how to put Northcliffe's 84 locals into a \u00a3200m pot grotesquely shrunken from the \u00a31.5bn that Lord Rothermere valued them at only six years ago. For all the pervasive gloom, Northcliffe is profitable: operating profits up more than 50% in the last half-year. Other big players, such as Trinity Mirror and Johnston Press, are profitable, too. Just not, by a long chalk, as profitable as they used to be.</p> <p>But then, nobody expects newspaper margins to wow the FTSE any longer. What Local World might prove, though, is a nice little earner. And if it does that, then the whole of the regional press may have cause to shout \"salvation!\" as well.</p>",
  "<p>The easy answer to Sir Brian Leveson's problem has always been floating temptingly out there, just over the Irish Sea. Dublin's press-council-plus-ombudsman system already has all the Fleet Street papers who sell copies in Ireland as more-or-less voluntary members, without fear or overmuch fury. It also features a novel kind of statutory underpinning because both council and ombudsman are mentioned in the 2009 Defamation Act, which theoretically means members qualify for lower libel damages because they're fair and responsible citizens.</p> <p>What could be neater? A solution embraced and working that provides real incentives to join? Even Richard Desmond has signed up. No wonder the <em>Times</em> is predicting that the Leveson report, when it arrives, may boast a bright green cover and shamrock trimmings. It will be billed, apparently, as \"light-touch regulation\", a mild, modest blend of this and that no one need get too worked up about.</p> <p>Unless, of course, you want to light the blue touchpaper and retire immediately: because all is not quite as it seems. To begin with, the Irish regime does not involve fines as sanctions \u2013 just printed corrections and adjudications. It does not, in a strict sense, investigate anything beyond individual complaints from those personally affected. It is fundamentally \u2013 like almost every other press regulation body in the western world \u2013 a complaints-handling organisation. It takes up cases only after a complainant has failed to get satisfaction from a newspaper. It does not, in general, consider wider issues or secondhand beefs. Nor is membership of the system complete. Voluntary means voluntary and a number of smaller papers and magazines haven't joined \u2013 the <em>Private Eye</em> exception on a rather bigger scale.</p> <p>Every one of those points (well charted in a<a href=\"http://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/fileadmin/documents/Publications/Working_Papers/Regulating_the_Press.pdf\" title=\"\"> Reuters Institute study</a>) falls way short of the overarching Leveson diagnosis of what's needed. Many of them, indeed, are more rigorously addressed by the UK press's own scheme for a upgraded Press Complaints Commission bolted together by contract law. The Irish ombudsman \u2013 horror of horrors! \u2013 is a twinkly, humorous journalist turned politician, John Horgan. He's long on charm and common sense. But he is still a journalist by instinct \u2013 not at all the \"independent\" voice that Leveson prescribes. Nor is the press council itself especially independent by London lights. Six of its nominated members represent the press in various ways. Seven are appointed because they don't, but a former diplomat as chair, sitting with three academics and three lawyers, isn't necessarily a blend that speaks to a wider public.</p> <p>And as for the light-touch underpinning, remember two heavyweight things. One is that the press council is accountable to the D\u00e1il because the justice minister can revoke the order recognising it in the Defamation Act \u2013 with parliamentary scrutiny of its performance due in 2014-15. Another is that, in a crisis, the justice minister thinks he (and not the communications minister) has an obligation to intervene. So when the Irish <em>Daily Star</em> published those topless pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge, the ministry of justice was into action in a flash, ordering a review and threatening to introduce a pretty draconian privacy bill that was lying ostentatiously on the minister's desk.</p> <p>There's independence and independence, in short. There's a not-entirely-innocent underpinning that can lead to bigger things in a trice. And there's always a threat or two of something worse lurking not so far in the background.</p> <p>The Irish solution has flourished so far because, most of the time, it deals in persuasion \u2013 because it demands few of the penalties and obeisances Leveson has on his list. But don't think (small country/big country) it would function so sweetly over here, especially when Horgan himself adds one more caveat \u2013 that a solution should be negotiated and agreed as the Irish example was: not imposed by fiat.</p>",
  "<p>Michael Heseltine, the cabinet minister whose leadership bid precipitated the fall of Margaret Thatcher but not his own rise, has always been a breath of fresh air in British public life.</p> <p>When the Thatcher cabinet was divided, in her own terms, between \"wets\" and \"dries\" \u2013 the wets being ministers such as Sir Ian Gilmour, Jim Prior and Peter Walker, who opposed the monetarist policies adopted by Thatcher's \"dry\" entourage \u2013 Michael, now Lord, Heseltine, delighted in the ambivalent position of being regarded as \"half wet and half dry\".</p> <p>During a long period when it was unfashionable to say so, he made no secret of his belief in the important role of government, whether central or local, in promoting economic growth. With help from some ideas provided by the cabinet office thinktank, Heseltine played a major role in reviving Liverpool after the Toxteth riots.</p> <p>In recent years Heseltine has been an enthusiastic admirer of David Cameron's. It was a relief to some of us when the prime minister and chancellor called upon our wet and dry friend to come in from the cold, and he has not disappointed. What is more, the welcome accorded by Cameron and Osborne to a report that challenges their approach to many things has been warm enough to escape the accusation of \"damning with faint praise\".</p> <p>It is easy to lose count of the recommendations, on everything from transport infrastructure to local government, that Heseltine has made, but 89 seems to be the agreed figure for the total in his report <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/heseltine-review\" title=\"\"><em>No Stone Unturned: In Pursuit of Growth</em></a>.</p> <p>If we stand back from the detail, over which there will be endless arguments and infighting, it is the broad approach that matters. This country, in postwar decades, has lurched from one policy fashion to another in pursuit of the economic philosopher's stone. This stone, with due respect to Heseltine, has remained persistently unturned.</p> <p>In the 1960s and 1970s we had national plans and forums such as The National Economic Development Council that brought what were known as \"both sides of industry\" (employers and trade unionists) together with government. These were all collective efforts to resolve the British economy's weaknesses, accompanied by attempts by governments of both major political parties \"to back winners\".</p> <p>After the short life of the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation in the late 1960s, the fashion turned against intervention, the classic failure being the government-engineered merger of Leyland Motors with BMC to create British Leyland. But as Nicholas Comfort notes in his book <em>Surrender</em>, \"the IRC itself performed valuable work in bringing together companies in fields like engineering, between which there was a natural synergy\".</p> <p>Under Thatcher and her svengali Sir Keith Joseph \u2013 who thought the Department of Trade and Industry, which he headed, should be abolished \u2013 government intervention became dirty words, and the future lay in deregulation and low taxes.</p> <p>Well, we all know where that led. The wider significance of Heseltine's report is that the coalition is finally waking up to the fact that extreme free-market policies are bad for the nation's health, and \"may contain nuts\". It is foolhardy for governments not to take a strategic view of the supply side of the economy: why, the CBI has been crying out for this floppy coalition to make up its mind about energy and infrastructure \u2013 policies that affect the plans of business big and small.</p> <p>Heseltine is well aware of how the policies of recent years have aggravated the imbalance between manufacturing and financial services, as well as between London and the regions. It was significant that he launched his report in Birmingham, the base of one of his heroes, Joseph Chamberlain.</p> <p>I wish the noble lord nothing but the best in embarking on the long haul of British industrial and regional revival. But at this stage one has to sound a dissenting note. Economics is about supply and demand. Contrary to the belief of the early 19th century French philosopher Jean-Baptiste Say, (promulgator of Say's Law), supply does not create its own demand.</p> <p>Heseltine says he endorses the government's deficit reduction strategy. I wonder if he really does. There is a huge shortage of demand in this economy and in most of the rest of Europe. The Keynesian revolution was about the need to manage demand. As Martin Beck of Capital Economics points out, GDP in the UK is now about 14% below what it would have been if the long-run trend rate of growth had continued after the financial crisis. Beck reckons that, even assuming the crisis has permanently damaged some capacity, the economy is still operating at about 6% below potential because of premature \"fiscal consolidation\".</p> <p>Alas, the damage to our industrial structure is such that the recent devaluation of the pound has still left us with a formidable trade deficit. The Office for Budget Responsibility and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research are both concerned about the trend of the current balance of overseas payments. In a disconcertingly convincing pamphlet, <a href=\"http://astore.amazon.co.uk/civitas-21/detail/1906837376\" title=\"\"><em>A Price That Matters</em></a> (Civitas) the economist John Mills argues that the pound remains seriously overvalued. The terrible truth may be that, in order for exporters and rivals to importers to take advantage of all that spare capacity, and boost output and employment, we need yet another significant devaluation.</p> <p><em>William Keegan's new book, Saving the World?

The former Python is so nice that he can make even that saintly knight David Attenborough look like a professional grouch.</p> <p>No matter where he goes in the world, he unfailingly packs his diffident smile and self-effacing banter. You can understand why members of remote mountain tribes who have never seen the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese_Shop_sketch\" title=\"\">cheese shop sketch</a> still feel an instinctive warmth toward this engaging Englishman with his awkward decency and gentle quips. He appears utterly accepting of everyone he encounters.</p> <p>This is his strength as a traveller, but also the weakness of his popular travelogues, and never more glaringly than in his latest series, <strong>Brazil With Michael Palin</strong>. As he states in the credit sequence, although he's roamed the globe for 25 years, he had never previously been to the world's fifth largest country.</p> <p>Yet now he's made the effort, you wonder why he bothered. The first two shows have been a whistlestop tour of cultural cliches whose rehashing in no way required his presence.</p> <p>In the first episode, he visited north-east Brazil, where he discovered that Brazilians are obsessed with festivals and dancing. Not even the most unpromising neighbourhood shindig was safe from his jolly attendance as he crisscrossed the region's vast terrain in search of anywhere with colourful costumes and a rhythmic beat. Like the affable bobby at the Notting Hill carnival, he was only too happy to perform the role of clumsy white foil to uninhibited dark sensuousness.</p> <p>But in best travel guide tradition, Brazil is a nation of contrasts, so last week Palin took off into the Amazon rainforest to visit indigenous tribespeople, whose way of life, he told us, is very different from that of their countrymen in the big cities. For, deep in the jungle, they are obsessed with... festivals and dancing.</p> <p>Like some middle-class Prince Philip in chinos, Palin watched one ceremony after another, heroically maintaining a face of good-humoured interest. Who knows what he really thought, but any curiosity this viewer may previously have harboured about Amazonian tribal rituals in honour of the spirits of river fish is now comprehensively satisfied.</p> <p>The truth is that, whether prancing around in warpaint or waiting for modernity to swallow them up, the tribespeople were just walk-on exotics \u2013 literally in the case of one old naked man who wandered into shot wearing what looked like either a codpiece in the shape of an erection or simply an erection with no codpiece. As though in surreal homage to <em>Monty Python</em>, Palin continued talking about suspended hammocks.</p> <p>Palin noted that there are now only a fraction of the 5 million indigenous people in Brazil that were there when Europeans first arrived. By some accounts, the death count in North America was even worse. In <strong>Rich Hall's Inventing the Indian</strong>, the word \"genocide\" was used by at least one contributor. While that may not have been the explicit aim of American expansion, it was too often the result, if only as a consequence of the spread of European infectious diseases.</p> <p>As an exercise in sociopolitical anthropology, <em>Inventing the Indian </em>was the kind of sharply droll essay we have come to expect from Hall, following the <a href=\"http://www.qi.com/\" title=\"\">irregular <em>QI</em> guest</a>'s equally rousing forays into American history, <em>How the West Was Lost</em> and <em>The Dirty South</em>. But as an appreciation of cinema, it lacked the depth and richness of the former, for the very good reason that the cinematic depiction of Native Americans has, with few exceptions, been a travesty of concocted stereotypes.</p> <p>As sometime-comedian presenters go, Hall is the anti-Palin: opinionated, provocative and about as cosy as a wire-wool jockstrap. Although his set expression \u2013 a sort of stoic alarm \u2013 puts me in mind of Steve McQueen, he doesn't subscribe to his fellow American's taciturnity. Throughout some of his lengthier and more splenetic diatribes, Hall demonstrated no discernible desire or need to breathe.</p> <p>And when (accurately) describing James Fenimore Cooper's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_the_Mohicans\" title=\"\"><em>The Last of the Mohicans </em></a>as a \"bloated, turgid orotund work of spectacular historical misrepresentation\", he sounded in danger of his own bloated orotundity. But then self-critical parody was a playful theme in a serious film.</p> <p>Hall tore into the way that white people, such as Kevin Costner, insisted on becoming spokespeople for the pain of Native Americans. As the impassioned and conspicuously white Hall repeated the same sin, Dallas Goldtooth, an activist-comedian from the Dakota tribe, shook his head with mock disapproval. The unstated part of the joke was that Hall is said to be part&#xa0;Cherokee.</p> <p>During an appearance on <em>Top Gear</em>, Hall once made up a song about the mundane Rover 25. <strong>Top Gear: 50 Years of Bond Cars</strong> could have done with that brand of inventiveness. Instead, there was Richard Hammond working himself into paroxysms of pleasure over the many cars 007 has driven across 50 years of the film franchise.</p> <p>As Hammond is permanently situated on or around the trigger point of auto-climax, there was nothing particularly novel about that. There were a couple of good anecdotes about the impecunious early days of the film series, when the budget was pushed to the limit to hire a Sunbeam Alpine for 12 shillings a day and Aston Martin repeatedly refused to loan the film-makers one of its cars.</p> <p>But the effect of multiple spectacular stunts and crashes all slammed together threatened to do the impossible and dampen my appetite for the new Bond film. Nor was Hammond helped by his interviews with Roger Moore, who was always too camp to appreciate the Bond iconography (he claimed his favourite Bond car was a 2CV), and the director <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Hamilton\" title=\"\">Guy Hamilton</a>, who was responsible for guiding the series into its 1970s slump.</p> <p>Filmed against sunny backdrops of yacht-filled marinas, the octogenarian Moore and nonagenarian Hamilton might be said to be living the Bond dream. Except dreams, like Bond himself, are never meant to age.</p> <p>It's the privilege of each generation to look back at its predecessor and pronounce with bewildered relief that it was a different time back then. We've heard that conclusion a lot in relation to Jimmy Savile's recently revealed activities. Let's hope the next generation will say the same thing about the forced marriages and so-called honour killings of which countless young women continue to be silent victims.</p> <p><strong>Exposure: Banaz \u2013 An Honour Killing </strong>was a powerful indictment of the misogynistic control that menaces some communities, and the misplaced cultural sensitivity that allows it to go unchallenged. This told the story of Banaz Mahmod, a Londoner who fled an arranged marriage to a violent rapist and brought a death sentence upon herself by falling in love with a man from a different Kurdish clan.</p> <p>Her family arranged her garroting, then many in the Kurdish community tried to subvert the police inquiry. The police estimate that more than 50 people were involved. What made it all the more shocking was that Mahmod had been to the police several times to warn them that she was about to be murdered. Nothing was done.</p> <p>This excellent film reminded us that \"honour killings\" are often collective crimes committed by individuals who are supported by extended networks. When the day arrives that such murders bring not honour but only shame, the killers will face the communal rejection they most fear. Unfortunately, as things stand, the people in hiding are those who stood by Mahmod.</p>",
  "<p>There's something quaintly touching about the spectacle of two publishing conglomerates \u2013 Bertelsmann and Pearson \u2013 arranging for their book-publishing arms (Random House and Penguin respectively) to <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/29/us-pearson-idUKBRE89S0C120121029\" title=\"\">huddle together for warmth</a> against the icy blasts coming from California (Google and Apple) and Seattle (Amazon). When the deal (which still has to be approved by regulators) was announced, there was the usual corporate guff about \"synergies\" \u2013 aka job losses \u2013 and about how the new partnership will be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/table/2012/oct/29/penguin-random-house-key-facts\" title=\"\">\"the world's leading publishing house\"</a>, which will give it \"the upper hand\" in its dealings with Apple and Amazon.</p> <p>Ho, ho. In the long view of history, the Bertelsmann-Pearson deal will be seen as just the latest instalment of a long-running story: a tale of formerly dominant industries trying to prevent their venerable business models being dismantled by the internet. The early victims were travel agents, record labels, newspapers, magazines and broadcast networks.</p> <p>In each case, the relevant executives could be heard loudly declaring that while it was indeed the case that the guys \"over there\" (gesturing in the direction of some other industry) were being disintermediated by the network, nevertheless the speaker's own industry was special and therefore immune from technological contagion. Universities and book publishers have been arguing like this for quite a while. The Bertelsmann-Pearson deal suggests that the publishers have finally heard the tocsin. Universities haven't got the message yet.</p> <p>The funny thing about the publishing industry is that long before it was really threatened by the internet it was busily rearranging itself so as to make it more vulnerable to it. The process was vividly described by sociologist John Thompson in his book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0745661068/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0745661068&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=meme11-21\" title=\"\"><em>Merchants of Culture</em></a>, the best account we have of what happened to publishing. As Professor Thompson tells it, the transformation of the industry occurred in three phases. In the first, the retail environment changed as large chains (Barnes &amp; Noble, Waterstones, Borders et al) supplanted independent bookstores. This created a new phenomenon \u2013 the mass-market hardback. Second, a new breed of aggressive literary agent appeared, poaching authors and leaning on publishers for unsustainable advances for the aforementioned hardbacks. And finally, large public corporations (think Bertelsmann, Pearson, News Corp) started acquiring the smallish publishing houses that once constituted the bulk of the industry, in the process transforming something that was once based on private ownership, long-term thinking, the nurturing of authors and backlists into an industry driven predominately by the obsession of stock markets with short-term (ie quarterly) results.</p> <p>Thus publishing turned into an industry that was inordinately reliant on blockbuster products to deliver the results that Wall Street demanded. The result was a market characterised by what statisticians call a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail\" title=\"\">power-law distribution</a> \u2013 ie one in which a relatively small number of products sell in enormous volume while a \"long tail\" of other products sell in relatively modest quantities. The physical world of high street shops can't handle a long tail for the simple reason that shelf-space costs money. Every book has to earn its rent. But internet outfits such as Amazon don't have any problem handling the long tail; in fact, the company probably makes more from selling non-bestsellers than it does from blockbusters.</p> <p>Which is how we've arrived at the point where our conglomerate publishing giants are getting really scared. They can see themselves heading down the slippery slope that made the record labels prisoners of the Apple iTunes store, except, in this case, for Apple read Amazon.</p> <p>If you think that this might be good news for consumers, think again. Consider, for example, all those people who happily purchase books for their Amazon Kindles. (On the train the other day, five people in my immediate vicinity were reading on them.) The blogosphere was much exercised recently when a blogger, Martin Bekkelund, reported on the <a href=\"http://www.bekkelund.net/2012/10/22/outlawed-by-amazon-drm/\" title=\"\">plight of a Norwegian woman</a> \u2013 identified only as Linn \u2013 who found that she had lost all the books she had purchased for her Kindle. The device had been remotely erased by Amazon because of some mysterious \"problem\" with her account. Mr Bekkelund published the set of increasingly Kafkaesque emails Linn received from Amazon as she tried to find out why she had been victimised in this way. In the end, after the blog post received wide circulation, Linn's Kindle was \u2013 just as mysteriously \u2013 reloaded with the books she had bought.</p> <p>Except that she hadn't really bought them. All she had done was to buy a <em>licence</em> to read them on \"her\" Kindle <a href=\"http://blogs.computerworlduk.com/simon-says/2012/10/rights-you-have-no-right-to-your-ebooks/index.htm\" title=\"\">at Amazon's pleasure</a>. Which makes one wonder how the Trade Descriptions Act might view the company's invitation to \"Buy now with 1-Click\" on a Kindle book.</p>",
  "<p>China's incoming leaders face a growing clamour for reform as the days count down to the country's once-a-decade power transition, with demands for changes across the policy spectrum: from reining in the vast state-owned enterprises to increasing the accountability of cadres.</p> <p>\"Economic and political reforms must go together,\" urged an editorial in the <a href=\"english.caixin.com/2012-10-31/100454595_1.html\" title=\"\">influential magazine <em>Caixin</em> last week</a>. \"Too often, the heavy hand of government in the market and the dominance of state monopolies stifle competition, distort the market and allow rent-seeking and corruption to thrive.</p> <p>\"Abuses of power have wreaked havoc in society, causing political divisions, the income gap to widen and animosity between government and people. The polarisation and fragmentation in society is deeply worrying ... If reformers don't check the abuse of power and push for political reform, China could easily lose the gains it has made.\"</p> <p>Many saw the current leaders as potential reformers when they took office. Now, however, they are accused of missing opportunities and maintaining the status quo.</p> <p>\"Deng Xiaoping had a famous saying about how reform should go: 'Crossing the river by feeling the stones',\" said Gao Wenqian, previously an official researcher and now a senior policy adviser at the New York-based Human Rights in China, who says that he is sceptical that any significant changes will actually materialise. \"The present situation is 'feeling the stones, but not crossing the river'.\"</p> <p>\"The effervescence of the debate in recent weeks over reform and the Chinese Communist party's future is consistent with the atmosphere that always precedes a leadership turnover,\" noted Christopher Johnson of the US thinktank the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.</p> <p>The handover process begins on Thursday, when delegates gather for the 18th party congress in Beijing. A week or so later, the new politburo standing committee \u2013 the country's top political body \u2013 will be unveiled.</p> <p>Xi Jinping is Hu Jintao's designated successor as China's leader. It is assumed that Li Keqiang will replace Wen Jiabao as prime minister, but the full composition of the standing committee remains uncertain. It is expected to shrink from nine to seven members, which should make decision-making easier in the consensus-based system and, potentially, pave the way to bolder moves.</p> <p>The latest indications, however, suggest that figures who are thought to be more open to reform \u2013 such as Li Yuanchao, head of the powerful Organisation Department, and the Guangdong party secretary Wang Yang \u2013 have not been selected, though some believe Li may squeeze in.</p> <p>Optimists say that a younger generation of leaders may be more willing to rethink policy. They have more experience of the outside world; they have studied subjects such as law rather than engineering; and Xi has the confidence that comes of being born into a powerful communist family.</p> <p>Reformers are also buoyed by a recent meeting between Xi and Hu Deping, an influential liberal figure, and the fact that thinktanks have been drawing up proposals for overhauling the economy. They argue that problems such as corruption and state inefficiency have accumulated and become more obvious over the last decade.</p> <p>\"In the past, the high speed of economic growth could ease the problems. China's pace of economic development has declined right now, and it has exposed the social problems,\" said Gao.</p> <p>Others say that meetings and proposal requests commit Xi to nothing, and that any plans he develops will require the agreement of colleagues and party elders. In particular, the sceptics insist, any political reforms that do occur are likely to be minor, most likely in the form of fresh attempts to explore \"intra-party democracy\".</p> <p>That, argues Jeremy Paltiel, an expert on the Communist party at Carleton University in Canada, is simply a contradiction. \"The party cannot be an organisation of executives who are subject to a single discipline and at the same time a deliberative assembly of people free to present their opinions and pursue their interests,\" he said.</p> <p>\"If the discipline were to be relaxed, the party would cease to function as the backbone of the state and lower levels could no longer be relied upon to follow the will of the centre.\"</p> <p>Neither are economic reforms straightforward. Ideological opposition may have faded \u2013 these days, elders such as former president and prime minister Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji have their own record of reform \u2013 but in its place are powerful vested interests. Economic and political power are more closely wed than ever.</p> <p>Another powerful deterrent is the lesson the elite has drawn from the Soviet Union \u2013 that it would be most vulnerable at the moment of reform. Only a crisis, many think, could prompt major change. But in the end, argued the Beijing-based scholar Deng Yuwen, the future course of China must be down to its people. \"Whether reform can happen depends on society, not the leaders,\" he said.</p> <p>\"If society strongly demands reform, even if the leaders don't want to do it, they have to. For that reason, I think that the next generation will carry out stronger and more powerful reform than before.\"</p>",
  "<p>Paul Thomas Anderson is the critics' director, or one of them \u2013 and as if to prove it, at the press show of his latest epic, <em>The Master</em>, there were agonised male groans when it was announced that, rather than watching 70mm film, we would have to make do with digital (insoluble technical problem, apparently). Not that many of us left our seats, even though some had already seen the film at Venice, or wherever. This is how much the critics love Anderson: most were ready and willing to submerge themselves in his film's murky depths again, digital or not.</p> <p>Will the public want to see <em>The Master </em>twice? I doubt it. A few may not even be able to endure it once, all the way through. It is a long, inscrutable film, and one deeply in love with its own processes. Watching it is like being stuck in a one-way system in a strange town; with every loop, it grows more familiar and yet more confusing. Anderson seems not to care that his script is oblique to the point of folly, preferring instead to rely on the way it looks (his shots, so beautifully framed, make you think of the great American painters, of Edward Hopper, Grant Wood, even Richard Diebenkorn) and, more heavily, on its central performances. He wouldn't be the first to go this route \u2013 mass Oscar nominations, as Anderson's last movie, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/feb/10/paulthomasanderson.drama\" title=\"\"><em>There Will Be Blood</em></a><em>,</em> received, often send film-makers bonkers when next they go to work. But for this viewer, <em>The Master </em>was a huge disappointment. After an hour, I was baffled. After two, I was bored stiff.</p> <p>In interviews, Anderson has denied that <em>The Master</em> is about Scientology. In the disorienting years following the second world war, he insists, all sorts of barmy creeds and cults were able to claim their recruits; his film might depict any one of them. Nevertheless, The Cause seems a lot like Scientology to me. Its Hubbard-like leader, Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), aka the Master, is obsessed with human potential \u2013 \"Do your past failures bother you?\" his acolytes ask, as they accost folk in the street \u2013 and he is apt to talk of what happened \"trillions\" of years ago in the same manner that most people discuss what happened yesterday in Sainsbury's. He also \u2013 again, big L Ron springs energetically to mind \u2013 encourages his followers to \"regress\", the better that they might explore their past lives. He, it turns out, was something big during the Franco-Prussian war.</p> <p>Into his orbit comes Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) \u2013 the clue, we note, is in the surname \u2013 who has been discharged from the US navy with psychological problems. Freddie is an alcoholic, addicted to hooch he makes from paint stripper and cough medicine, and he has violent tendencies. What else is he going to do but follow Lancaster and his creepy wife, Peggy (Amy Adams)? He has no job, no people, no real desires. For his part, Dodd makes him a special project. Thanks to his ego, which has the proportions and toxicity of a mushroom cloud, he isn't built to resist a challenge. So, they hook up, and they travel, and should anyone question Lancaster, Freddie deals with them the old-fashioned way, throwing a punch in their direction rather than, say, the hefty first volume of the Master's, erm, masterwork.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fJ1O1vb9AUU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fJ1O1vb9AUU?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The first half hour of the film, in which we glimpse Freddie in the years before he collides with Dodd, is magisterial, as mesmerising and as singular even as the opening of <em>There Will Be Blood</em>. Freddie on a beach, pretending to screw a woman he and other sailors have fashioned from sand; Freddie working as a department store photographer, shooting those for whom the American dream might just become a reality; Freddie hacking monstrous cabbages from their brittle stalks. There is a wonderful scene in New York, when Lancaster is revealed as a fraud in the house of a rich recruit \u2013 and Freddie, by way of a portent, hurls a tomato at the accuser's chest.</p> <p>But once we've established that Lancaster is a phoney and Freddie a fuck-up, the film seems not to know where to go next. Over and over, Anderson has us listen to Dodd's silly, tautologous teachings. Over and over, we watch Freddie being \"programmed\" (Dodd makes him walk back and forth across a room with his eyes shut, who knows why). But what does all this achieve? Nothing. Neither one of them changes. It's not that I expected a reckoning; the Scientologists, after all, are a good deal more powerful in 2012 than they were in 1950. But no film, surely, should end exactly where it began.</p> <p>And what of these two actors, who will no doubt soon be slugging it out for an Oscar? Phoenix's face has more shadows than Vienna at midnight; usually, I'd rather watch him than almost any other actor. Here, though, he's trapped in a set of tics and winces. He does rage brilliantly, rallying every part of his body, even the sad hump of his back, for the fight. But after a while this fails to move you, its monotony pounding in your head.</p> <p>Seymour Hoffman, meanwhile, turns the charisma up to high, in the hope, I guess, of emphasising the showbusiness aspect to cult leadership. The only trouble is, his flashiness maroons him. You feel, always, that you are watching a turn. For sure, this reinforces your scepticism; even when he's being kind, you look at him with narrowed eyes. But it makes you doubt the film, too. It's so extravagantly showy. What is it that we're being sold, here? A movie that yearns to be great, but really isn't. A movie that is so long-winded, it could graze the hem of the irredeemably prolix L Ron Hubbard himself.</p>",

In honour of the date, this concert had two works on hallowed themes: HK Gruber's popular monstrosity <em>Frankenstein!!</em>, written in Brechtian cabaret style, and <em>Dead Elvis</em> by Michael Daugherty (b 1954), each a gruesome satire on the penalties of sin.</p> <p>Premiered by Simon Rattle and the RLPO in Liverpool in 1978, <em>Frankenstein!!</em> spins a free-fall tale of vampires, rats and Miss Dracula, the texts ghoulishly delivered here by chansonniers Daniel Shelvey and Andrea Tweedale, talented young singers from the Royal Northern College of Music poised for professional flight. <em>Dead Elvis</em>, written for the same instruments as Stravinsky's <em>Soldier's Tale</em> and echoing its \"pact with&nbsp;the devil\" theme, features a bebopping solo bassoon as Elvis, who dallies with Las Vegas excess, but has moments of lyricism too. RLPO principal bassoon Alan Pendlebury gave himself up to the part, even dressing in white Elvis suit and wig and managing to play on bended knee. I hope they paid him appropriately.</p> <p>As well as Var\u00e8se's <em>Octandre</em> and Elliott Carter's <em>Asko Concerto</em>, the programme featured the world premiere of <em>Perspectives</em>, a gritty, elliptical piece worth exploring further by the Italian composer Annachiara Gedda (b 1986). Another first, Ivor Hodgson's new <em>A Little Light Music</em>, full of magpie nods and echoes, was instead a light, bright party piece. Often in small ensembles, whether for particular reasons of repertoire or musical personality, a single player&nbsp;stands out. Tonight's man of the&nbsp;match was cellist Ian Bracken.</p> <p>The Glasgow-based <strong>Scottish Ensemble</strong>, whose autumn tour diverted south to London's Wigmore Hall on Tuesday, calls itself the UK's only professional string orchestra. It might better describe itself as a scintillation of ace soloists who combine bracing energy, flexibility and precision, breathing and moving as one. They bring new meaning to the term \"attack\" \u2013 the point at which a bow hits, strokes, caresses the string. Their control is phenomenal, their phrasing lean and sinewy. They can do warm and voluptuous too, as they demonstrated in a programme which culminated in an arrangement, by the ensemble's leader/director, Jonathan Morton, of Schumann's A major quartet Op 41.</p> <p>The idea of amplifying a work for a dozen players instead of four proves illuminating when the individuals are so well matched. Morton also arranged Britten's youthful <em>Three Divertimenti</em>, a joyous, at times raucous celebration full of open strings, pizzicato, glissandi and drones.</p> <p>In a programme full of variety \u2013 Mozart, Purcell, Bach \u2013 the ensemble gave the London premiere of Martin Suckling's <em>In memoriam EMS</em> (2012). This miniature \"postcard\", one of several he will compose for these players, packed aural variety and luminosity into its few minutes' duration. Microtones and harmonics, at the start, create strange tonalities reminiscent of the swoopy whoop of an Ondes Martenot. As the piece develops, the musical lines interweave independently and ethereally, as if angels had abandoned their pins to dance a Highland reel.</p> <p>Suckling (b 1981), himself a violinist who grew up in Glasgow playing in ceilidh bands but who was also a member of the <a href=\"http://www.nyo.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Youth Orchestra</a>, has an exciting, distinctive voice and a rigorous ear for detail. This tiny elegy is characterised by cheeping, bird-song conversation among upper strings, until a deep, lyrical cello lament emerges from the depths. The concert was broadcast live on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/\" title=\"\">BBC Radio 3</a>. Listen again on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01nj91c\" title=\"\">iPlayer</a> until Tuesday.</p> <p>Puccini never seemed to fall in love with his early opera <em>Edgar</em> (1887), maintaining it was best ignored. Mostly it has been. He revised it in 1905, squeezing four acts into three, and it enjoyed minor success. <a href=\"http://www.newsussexopera.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>New Sussex Opera</strong></a>, a mix of professionals and skilled amateurs, has mounted the&nbsp;UK premiere of the longer version, first in Lewes and London, with Southsea and Eastbourne to come.</p> <p>True, the plot is lurid and misshapen. Events lurch hither and thither. Fidelia loves Edgar and gives him an almond branch. Edgar fancies the \"exotic\" (meaning exactly what \"exotic\" is no longer allowed to mean) Tigrana. They go to church but a lynch mob appears. Edgar sets fire to the family home then dresses up as a monk&nbsp;and pretends to be dead. All ends badly. I have omitted some details.</p> <p>Peculiar and uneven though it is, the music is glorious, and absolutely worth hearing. All the seeds of the composer's later style are there, from the rapturous melodic choruses and arias (including a duet which resurfaces in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/tosca\" title=\"\"><em>Tosca</em></a>), to familiar orchestral scoring, the pairing of flute and harp, say, in embryo. New Sussex Opera's chorus was enthusiastic, with the women strong and lively, the men somewhat shy but never mind. The <a href=\"http://www.stpaulssinfonia.com/\" title=\"\">St Paul's Sinfonia</a> played with gusto, conducted by Nicholas Jenkins whose passion for the work was evident. John Hudson's Edgar, full of soaring moments, was perhaps too score-bound in this semi-staging. Mary Plazas's tender Fidelia, and Gweneth-Ann Jeffers's seductive Tigrana were the stars.</p> <p>The requiem in act three, sung for the eponymous hero who isn't in the coffin but is alive and well, is of special&nbsp;interest. As if to precis Puccini's own compositional life, or to&nbsp;predict his immortality, it was&nbsp;performed at his funeral.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/search/commentaire_id/the-gates-of-hell-8933.html?no_cache=1\" title=\"\"><em>The Gates of Hell</em></a>, a monumental sculpture by Auguste Rodin, was commissioned in 1880. The work depicts a scene from Dante's <em>Inferno</em>, and its form was inspired by the bronze doors of the Baptistery in Florence, where Dante was baptised.</p> <p>Rodin would work on <em>The Gates of Hell</em> until his death, 37 years later, but would admit eventually that his designs had become \"too distanced from reality\", and return to working from life with his models. Viewed today, the piece is an extraordinary technical achievement, but one which is clearly in thrall to, and limited by, its classical and Renaissance sources (you can see a similar struggle to wrest expressive form from the antique in Frederick Ashton's much-picked-at ballet <em>Sylvia</em>). Only when Rodin's individual figures are liberated from their mythological context and recreated as individual pieces \u2013 <em>The Kiss</em>, <a href=\"http://rodin-web.org/works/1881_shades.htm\" title=\"\"><em>The Three Shades</em></a>, <em>Fleeting Love</em> \u2013 do they become fully realised works of art.</p> <p><em>The Rodin Project</em>, Russell Maliphant's homage to the sculptor, is constrained by similar shackles, and triumphs precisely to the degree that these are thrown off. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/sep/29/russell-maliphant-sadlers-wells\" title=\"\"><em>AfterLight</em></a>, the choreographer's 2009 piece about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/vaslavnijinsky\" title=\"\">Nijinsky</a>, was a poignant meditation on the dancer's later years, but what made it transcendent was that at some unidentifiable moment you realised that Royal Ballet-trained Maliphant was also reflecting on his own life and career. It was highly nuanced \u2013 rarely has an artist inched more warily towards self-revelation \u2013 but it was there.</p> <p>To translate Rodin's oeuvre into dance would be impossible, and any attempt inescapably kitsch. Instead, Maliphant has used the sculptures as a starting point for improvisation, creating an eclectic language embracing capoeira, parkour and street moves, and setting a succession of tableaux to a score by Alexander Zekke. The first half of the piece, danced to Zekke's nervously skittering strings against a background of drapes lit by Michael Hulls in crocus shades of orange, purple and white, is unimpeachably beautiful. But beauty's a given with Maliphant, and his choreographic text is too referential, and perhaps too deferential, for us to gain much purchase.</p> <p>In the second half, though, Maliphant escapes his source material and remote past becomes vibrant present. From an academic exploration of sculptural tensions, Maliphant cuts to the tension of Rodin's domestic life \u2013 a wife, a younger mistress \u2013 and thence to a languorous erotic passage in which a bare-breasted Carys Staton and a wholly naked Jennifer White respectively embody (or so it seemed to me) a sexuality which is burnished by familiarity, and one which is alluring, mysterious and, ultimately, beyond reach. Rodin, at these moments, is lost from view. This is the choreographer's voice.</p> <p>An astounding duet for Tommy Franz\u00e9n and Dickson Mbi is equally unmediated. Performed to a yearning cello on a vertical surface which is at once rock face and prison wall, the two men seem almost&#xa0;weightless as they defy the limitations of their situation. Gravity reclaims them, of course, as his historical subject reclaims Maliphant.&#xa0;But not before we, and&#xa0;they,&#xa0;have glimpsed unbounded space.</p>",
  "<p>Looking for something to fuel long-held desires to become an old-fashioned cock-out rock star? Then welcome Pete Townshend's emotionally wrought and self-flagellating autobiography. For here is everything you hoped was true: the ability to buy Ronnie Wood's house, a fresh brow-mopping girl in the hotel room, the television-through-window exuberance of bandmates, the close encounters with Mick Jagger's bulge.</p> <p>But in Townshend's complex world there is much more too, perhaps enough to turn the rock dream sour: the awkward relationship with fans, the inability or unwillingness to recreate the hits of one's heyday with the Who (and the paranoid insecurity associated with that), the ordeal of sustaining a loving marriage, an unhinged childhood with an insatiable grandmother on the English coast. And at the end of it all is the auto-destruction, far more effective than his guitar smashing, an act that temporarily made Townshend one of the most reviled and misunderstood men in rock, which is saying something.</p> <p>In many ways, this is an important book, a fearless account by an influential cultural figure from a period when rock music could still transform lives. The writer Nik Cohn was the first to nail the Who's significance, observing in 1971 that they had made themselves into both the epitome and the entirety of rock music. The best thing about them? They were disaffected and they were loud, and often with rock that's all you need. We may now judge them as a template, a renewable rebellion that has led \u2013 via the Clash \u2013 to Nirvana and beyond. And Townshend's chords resonate still: with Keith Moon and John Entwistle gone, he and Roger Daltrey still fly the flag defiantly at rousing live shows, something Townshend calls a \"celebration machine\".</p> <p>But where Townshend can be an ungainly and a coruscating performer on stage, his writing is mostly the reverse; it is well-behaved and ordered, one catalogue of uppers and downers, mostly told at a flat pace. The book lacks the fiery eloquence of Townshend's windmilling mind, and there is a sad lack of hell-yeah enjoyment in his life, as found, for example, in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/31/keith-richards-life-rolling-stones\" title=\"\">Keith Richards's indulgent memoir</a>. There are occasional flashes of irony, but too much straight-faced telling without showing, and an uncharacteristic lack of imagination in the architecture of the narrative.</p> <p>But I did find myself laughing at the excesses, something Townshend also now finds absurd. In 1967, for example, he is worried that the Who are no longer the loudest group on Earth, surpassed in their ear-bleeding by (of all people) Vanilla Fudge. \"They had found a way of amplifying a Hammond organ up to rock guitar decibels,\" he writes. \"We were actually upset by this.\"</p> <p>Townshend's story is essentially one of searching. His songs powerfully reference the act of seeking and the concept of the seer, and he has always been keen to engage his own followers with this spiritual quest. But it's a mission that has barely concluded at the volume's close.</p> <p>The book is insightful about the creative process, haphazard and accidental as this often is; <em>Tommy</em> only makes sense to its creator once it has been performed live. I also enjoyed his memories of his time in the 1980s as an editor at Faber, an inspired shit-stirring exercise by chairman Matthew Evans and then head of fiction Robert McCrum (now of this parish), which managed the dual achievement of astonishing the old guard (PD James in particular was not impressed by his yobbo credentials), and bringing the fiercely old-school publishing house slightly closer to the modern world.</p> <p>Townshend's biggest concepts were usually too advanced for both his bandmates and his fans, and the sections in the book devoted to the lesser ones \u2013 the <em>Lifehouse</em>, <em>White City</em> and <em>Psychoderelict</em> projects \u2013 suggest deeply ingrained psychological trauma in which the writer is struggling to get something off his chest.His explanation for the charges relating to his use of a credit card to access images of child sex abuse holds up to scrutiny and what those close to him know of his generous and charitable character. He has always been digging for clues to abuse in his childhood and was now actively campaigning for a way of helping others with early trauma, and fighting against internet companies profiting from indecent images. Banged to rights and rightly so, he appears permanently humbled by the whole ordeal, no longer defiantly above the law in rock god strides.</p> <p>This is a worthwhile, comprehensive and culturally valuable account of a life, but its solidity is slightly enervating; it's no celebration machine. Unusually for me, it didn't inspire a rush to the iPod or Spotify, and it didn't leave me with the sense of elation I normally feel after brushes with the Who. In these sober and self-effacing times, Townshend gardens, sails, walks his dogs, loves his long-term companion Rachel Fuller, plans a new musical suite called <em>Floss</em>, and compiles definitive box sets. It may be unreasonable to continue to expect more from the man.</p>",
  "<p>Danish writer Lone Frank trained as a research scientist in biotechnology before becoming an award-wining science journalist. In her latest book, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/scienceandnature/9781851688333/my-beautiful-genome-exposing-our-genetic-future-one-quirk-at-a-time\" title=\"\"><em>My Beautiful Genome</em></a>, she turns her science on herself by embracing the latest developments in personal genomics to find out what these tests can tell us about ourselves and whether it's a good idea to take them. She is the only female writer to have been shortlisted for the <a href=\"http://royalsociety.org/awards/science-books/shortlist/\" title=\"\">2012 Royal Society Winton Prize for Science Books</a>.</p> <p><strong>Why did you decide to investigate your own genome?</strong><br>Genomics used to be like computers; for experts only. It was expensive. Nobody thought it would ever get out among the public. I heard about these first genome scans in 2008 and thought: this is momentous \u2013 now we can all get our own genetic information. We are at the beginning of a revolution where we can't really see where it's going, so I wanted to try it out for myself and see what it's like.</p> <p><strong>What tests did you do?</strong><br>I took tests that looked into my deep ancestry. I also had a genome scan where you can test variants that we know have to do with disease risks. You get a glimpse of what you could pass on to your children and also what diseases you might end up getting. I was tested for common breast cancer genes and also certain genes that are related to our psychological makeup.</p> <p><strong>Was there anything you were hoping to discover or that you were worried about?</strong><br>I was really worried about the <a href=\"http://cancerhelp.cancerresearchuk.org/type/breast-cancer/about/risks/breast-cancer-genes\" title=\"\">breast cancer genes, the BRCA genes</a>, because my mother and grandmother both died of breast cancer very early. I had always assumed that I probably have them. They convey up to 80% chance of getting breast cancer: they are the genes that make women get their breasts removed preemptively, so I was really worried. I was also interested in behaviour genetics and depression, and what we know about how genes will help to determine our psychology.</p> <p><strong>Do tests that link personality and genetics lead to an overly deterministic view of \u2013 it's not my fault, it's in my genes?</strong><br>One big message in the book is that genetic determinism is off. There is no geneticist out there who believes in genetic determinism or argues that it exists. Our genes are not our destiny. They are a hand of cards that we're dealt and we can play them differently. How we live our lives will impact on our genes and how our genes are expressed \u2013 some will be switched on, some will be switched off. Our lives matter and it's extremely important to get away from the false belief of genetic determinism.</p> <p><strong>You discovered you don't have the BRCA genes. Was that the biggest surprise? </strong><br>That was a nice surprise but it made more of an impact to get the results from the behaviour genetics test. My family is riddled with depression and I have recurring depressions myself. I found out all the genes that can predispose you to depression, I have them. And I am homozygous [have two copies], so it's the worst possible&#xa0;case.</p> <p><strong>Did the tests make you feel differently about your body?</strong><br>As a depressive person you often think of yourself as defective. But when you look into the biological background it can become easier to live with yourself and it can also become a tool to try to change things and think differently. Knowing I have a biological disposition means I am more able to distance myself from depressive moods; to say \"this is your biology speaking\" and try to not get involved in it. So living with both the family history and my own depressions has definitely become easier.</p> <p><strong>Might people become anxious about their health as a result of these tests?&#xa0;</strong><br>Theorists have said that must be the case because people can't really interpret the results \u2013 they are not a diagnosis. They are concerned that people will get nervous, they will have a lower quality of life. But when social scientists start to look into how people use this information it seems from all the studies that people do not in fact become more nervous; they do not fixate on diseases. Instead they use these tests proactively to say, what are the disease risks that I should do something about, should worry about, should get tested for?</p> <p><strong>You say consumers can't interpret the results but what about professionals?</strong><br>If you have a genome scan and take it to your GP, my guess is that she will react like my GP and say: \"Take it away, I don't know what that is\". Most GPs have learned a tiny bit of genetics in medical school and forgotten all about it. A lot of consumers who are into genomics know more genetics than GPs. But this is a wake-up call for society because this is the future, it's not something you can stop, so how do you upgrade healthcare personnel and how do we upgrade the population?</p> <p><strong>Surely if we all just strive to be healthier, that would negate the need for such tests. For instance, don't smoke, regardless of your risk for lung cancer.</strong><br>I'm not saying everyone should get tested but the people who do will use it as an incentive to do these things. In the future we may be able to say: if you have these genetic variants you should eat this kind of food or do this kind of exercise or take this kind of medicine to prevent this disease.</p> <p><strong>How close is that reality?</strong><br>The US Food and Drug Administration has standing recommendations on more than 100 drugs that they say before you prescribe this as a doctor you should do a genetic test, but only about 2% of GPs have ever ordered a genetic test. Instead of just doling out the same dose of the same medication to everybody who has a problem, they should test them.</p> <p><strong>Should people be worried about sharing their genetic information? There have been cases already of discrimination\u2026 </strong><br>I think it's very positive that a lot of people are willing to share their genetic and health information. Consumer genomics and citizen scientists and people donating their genetic and health information are going to be a boon for genetic research. But I also think it's a cultural question. Mainly it's in the US that you see these people who are all for open-source genomics. The worries you often find in Europe around genetics \u2013 privacy in particular \u2013 is kind of old-fashioned. It's built on genetic essentialism, the idea that this genome is really our essence, that it's who we are. And of course it's not, it's some information. If you are an employer, for example, you can tell much more from talking to a person than looking into their genome.</p> <p>But people can imagine running into the problems in the future where, if an employer finds out that a person is, say, at high risk of Alzheimer's or breast cancer, he won't hire them. So that's a question for lawmakers: how do we protect people but also make it possible for society to mine information?</p>",
  "<p>L\u00f6rrach, on the edge of the Black Forest, may be 700 miles away from Cadbury's historic home of Bournville, but it too can lay claim to a chocolate-making tradition dating back more than 100 years.</p> <p>The picture-postcard town is home to Milka, Germany's favourite chocolate bar; the factory gates are close enough to the Alps to receive milk from the herds grazing in the mountain meadows. Here too, a purple corporate livery is much in evidence \u2013 although Milka's art-nouveau lilac is of a distinctly lighter shade than Cadbury's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/oct/03/cadbury-trademark-colour-purple-open-thread\" title=\"\">now trademarked Pantone 2685C</a>. And both are now outposts of the sprawling Kraft global empire.</p> <p>Plant manager Peter Jungbeck says: \"L\u00f6rrach is like Bournville. They have been making chocolate for 170 years and we have been doing it for 130. The people are very proud that a brand like Milka is in their city.\" With 3m bars rolling off its production lines each day, Milka is the biggest local employer.</p> <p>Like Cadbury, it was once part of a family-run business, started by Swiss chocolatier Philippe Suchard, but it became part of Kraft following the 1990 takeover of Jacobs Suchard and is now one of its biggest brands, with annual sales of more than $1bn and spinoffs such as biscuits, cheese spread and hot chocolate. The Suchard name, in its classic gold embossed lettering, disappeared from the packets long ago.</p> <p>Cadbury was swallowed up by Kraft in 2010 after one of the hardest-fought takeovers in recent memory \u2013 but with the ink barely dry on the new stationery, it was all change again last month as the US group went ahead with a surprise demerger that saw more than 100 of its snack brands, including Cadbury, Milka, Toblerone and Oreo, spun off under the newly created banner of Mondelez International.</p> <p>The shakeup, unions fear, could spell change for 6,500 staff in the UK and Ireland, not least because factory workers are no longer protected by a pledge of no compulsory redundancies. The promise, which expired in March, was extracted from Kraft after it was called to account by parliament for reneging on the closure of the Cadbury plant at Somerdale near Bristol.</p> <p>Jennie Formby, national officer for food and drink industries at the union Unite, is concerned after 200 positions were cut at the end of last year: \"We never thought sites would close straight away, but there are certainly vulnerabilities \u2013 not just in the UK and Ireland but in the whole of&#xa0;Europe.\"</p> <p>At the Light Cube, a glass office block in Zurich, Mondelez's European head, Tim Cofer, met the press for the first time last week and waxed enthusiastic about the outlook for the month-old company \u2013 which, despite the split, is still the world's biggest chocolate and biscuit manufacturer with annual sales of $36bn.</p> <p>What was previously Kraft's European base is emblazoned with the company's garish new logo \u2013 also purple \u2013 and Cofer, a high-flier with the ear of group chief executive Irene Rosenfeld, insists the logic for the split was \"compelling\", creating two companies with different specialities and geographical footprints.</p> <p>But with 59 factories in Europe, the business is a jigsaw of assets amassed on an acquisition trail that has included Jacobs Suchard, Danone's biscuit arm Lef\u00e8vre-Utile (LU) \u2013 maker of classic French biscuits such as Petit Beurre \u2013 and most recently Cadbury. Cofer admits: \"There will be change over the coming years as we look for the most efficient network in the industry to support this snacking company. Our portfolio is too complicated, we have too many product lines and can unlock benefits from simplifying our portfolio.\"</p> <p>With nearly half its sales rung up in emerging markets, Cofer says Mondelez offers investors \"exposure to a higher growth profile\", and with eyes firmly on the demerger, he is eager to drive the corporate message home: \"This is not the old Kraft Foods \u2013 this is Mondelez International and we are a global company.\"</p> <p>The European business is also a big piece of the Mondelez pie, accounting for nearly 40% of sales, whereas North America, where it retains its listing, contributes less than a fifth of turnover.</p> <p>The opposite is true of the other half of the demerger, which will retain its original name. Kraft, famously described by one Cadbury descendant as that \"plastic cheese company\", will now account for turnover of around $19bn, having been left with a larder full of US grocery brands such as Miracle Whip, Jell-O and Kool-Aid.</p> <p>From Kraft's standpoint the \u00a311bn Cadbury deal was a good one, says Cofer, who led the integration: \"We are on track if not ahead of plan on everything we had hoped for. We created a business that grew faster than its separate parts.\" Costs as a percentage of sales decreased from 17.7% in 2009 to 14.2% in 2011 as savings made from bashing the two companies together were realised.</p> <p>Despite reports of mass defections, Cofer insists the group \"retained key talent\": former Cadbury executives Ruslan Kinebas and Andrew Gibson sit on the European leadership team while former UK managing director Trevor Bond is Cofer's counterpart in central and eastern Europe.</p> <p>\"We have legacy Cadbury folks leading categories, geographies and functions,\" he says, before stressing that it's not all about Cadbury. \"The same would apply for LU. On the sixth floor we have a fantastic collection of legacy LU folks. We are investing to bring together three legacy companies: Kraft, Cadbury and LU.\"</p> <p>But with the tax affairs of multinationals coming under increasing scrutiny, Kraft faced criticism when it shifted ownership of some of the UK companies to a Swiss holding company.</p> <p>There are \"many reasons\" to choose a Swiss base other than tax, insists Cofer, who says the company complies with \"all applicable tax legislation\" in the UK. \"Mondelez International pays corporation tax based on the laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates,\" he says, adding that Kraft has had a Swiss base for more than 50 years. \"It's not a new 'hey let's go to Switzerland'. From a talent attraction standpoint, it's a great place to live. It's no hardship to live in Zurich.\"</p> <p>If British consumers are perturbed about the fate of Cadbury under its latest new ownership, they are not showing it. The latest Nielsen data put the brand's UK market share at 29%, up 0.2% on the previous year.</p> <p>\"Our market share in the UK with Cadbury Dairy Milk has hit a record high,\" says Cofer. \"In the end the British customer is voting with her pounds and voting quite favourably.\"</p>",
  "<p>How much has the extraordinary wave of hope that swept the world four years ago, when President Obama was inaugurated, been borne out by his first term in office?</p> <p>Why do I think it is so vital that he wins again this week, for America and for the world?</p> <p>Let's remember President Obama inherited a very deep hole, a hole most Americans did not imagine existed. When he came in, we had lost four million jobs in four years \u2013 800,000 jobs evaporated in January 2009 alone. Since that time, we have created five and a half million new jobs. That's more than 30 straight months of job growth in tough economic times. In addition, he had to confront banks that, through their greed, had forced record-breaking home foreclosures. The global economy \u2013 from the US to Europe and around the world \u2013 was at the point of total collapse. The banks were bailed out.</p> <p>The automotive industry had collapsed. Now, because of the Obama administration's policies to rescue the auto industry, we're the number one auto-producing nation again. Autoworkers are once more working three shifts and producing high yields. The auto industry is back, though Romney said: \"Let them go bankrupt.\"</p> <p>Furthermore, when President Obama came into office, we were caught in a war of choice \u2013 an immoral, bad choice \u2013 in Iraq. President Bush and Tony Blair dealt us a severe blow. The whole world was telling them not to wage war \u2013 I was speaking in London at Hyde Park on the day of the big <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/2765041.stm\" title=\"\">protest</a>. We told them there was no basis for going into Iraq. Since then, we have lost British and American lives, resources and honour, and they have not been humble enough to apologise. That war cost us trillions of dollars, which took us from a budget surplus to a budget deficit.</p> <p>Now we have left Iraq and the administration has implemented a plan to wind down the war in Afghanistan, which is coming to a close in terms of American involvement. Billions of dollars spent on war can now be redirected to jobs, investment and economic development at home.</p> <p>There's a lot more we must do to be seen as leading the world by right. We have become addicted to leading by might and it takes some time to restore confidence and credibility. We're not there yet but we're moving in the right direction.</p> <p>So yes, when President Obama took office, the US and the world were in a deep, dark economic (and political) hole. But now we are moving through fields towards the mountaintop. Though we've yet to reach that point, the arrows are pointing in the right direction \u2013 jobs, industry, healthcare cover all on the rise, wars on the decline.</p> <p>Romney and the conservatives have derided the comprehensive health care plan as \"Obamacare.\" But the truth is that Obama does care. People would be dead without health insurance. And young people benefit as they can stay on their parents' health plans into their 20s. The insurance companies were charging higher and higher fees for ever lower cover and they claimed the right not to insure people. Obama broke up that kind of exploitative behaviour and today 30 million more Americans are covered. Obama's historic healthcare legislation will stand the test of time.</p> <p>And all of this achieved despite the attempt by the Republicans&#xa0;to demean the president.&#xa0;They called him a liar. They said that he's not an American, he's not a Christian, he's illegitimate.</p> <p>Romney offers no positive alternative for America. We are currently in the throes of a weather crisis, hurricane Sandy, which has wreaked havoc on the east coast. Railroads, subways, roads, bridges, houses, banks, whole communities have been devastated. Romney once said we don't need Fema, the federal government agency now co-ordinating the rescue and recovery programme related to these disasters. He says \"state authorities\" (not the federal government) should handle that devastation \u2013 and private investors.</p> <p>The fact is a state alone cannot handle such problems. And&#xa0;private investors should not be profiting out of such misery. It's the role of&#xa0;central government to be a part of the emergency repair and to be a part of the clean-up and reconstruction. Because of an act of nature, there must now be a massive investment in infrastructure. It will create jobs and contracts, new technology as well as other scientific advances.</p> <p>President Obama had made the case for that before the disaster \u2013 for the need to invest in infrastructure, in roads, buildings and bridges, to reinvest in America to put Americans back to work. Now that he's leading us in this crisis, even his adversaries are saying he's doing a good job. &#xa0;The president's leadership during hurricane Sandy is steady and confident.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/18/obama-inauguration-obama-white-house\" title=\"\">I said in an article in the <em>Observer</em> four years ago that Barack Obama's inauguration</a> was a magnificent moment in a five-decades-long race for civil rights in America and in the world as a whole. Has his first term&#xa0;stood up to the extraordinary hope he inspired? For black Americans, a ceiling has been removed. An African American, a woman or a Latino can&#xa0;now believe that their path through life will carry them as far as their dreams can imagine. If Obama can do it, it inspires women to think they can do it and Latinos to think they can do it. So the barrier to our dreams has been removed.</p> <p>But you cannot have racial reconciliation unless you have racial justice. Our <a href=\"http://www.rainbowpush.org/\" title=\"\">Rainbow</a> friends in the UK call it Equanomics \u2013 racial equality and economic justice. Black people are still facing tremendous racial injustice; we're number one in home foreclosure; the banks target us. We're number one in infant mortality. Number one in short life expectancy. Number one in unemployment. We're still very much on the margins.</p> <p>A few have done well enough to become symbolic examples. You look at Colin Powell, you look at Oprah and you look at some great athletes. But you can't measure the progress of the masses of black Americans by the symbolic value of extraordinary achievers. It's like swimming the English Channel. It's not the distance that makes it difficult to swim \u2013 it's the undercurrent. That's what we're struggling against \u2013 an undercurrent based on centuries of enslavement, institutional race inequalities and unfounded fears.</p> <p>I look at America embracing&#xa0;Olympic&#xa0;medallists, black and white; embracing the impact of black music upon the culture. You'd think those achievements would have brought more reconciliation. But we seem to be cherry-picking \u2013 selectively recognising black success while still disregarding racial injustice.</p> <p>The scar on America's soul is racial injustice. It is the key to equality, workers' rights, children's rights, environmental security and ending war. So how this issue is handled is the key to the salvation of our nation. Martin Luther King would say that the pursuit of racial justice is the way to redeem the soul of America. President Obama's achievement can only be seen as part of&#xa0;a long battle for civil rights. What one must appreciate is that his ascendancy is a long journey that can be traced in modern history He did not come to us unilaterally. He came out of a 64-year process. In 1948, President Truman ended military racial segregation. The Supreme Court knocked down decades of legal segregation in the Brown v Board of Education decision. We won a big victory in 1955 with the Montgomery bus boycott, after Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white person, leading to the end of segregation by 1964. We won the <a href=\"http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/1964_civil_rights_act.htm\" title=\"\">1964 Civil Rights Act</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/intro/intro_b.php\" title=\"\">1965 Voting Rights Act, e</a>nding discrimination at elections. We staged the anti-Vietnam war protests. From 1948 to 2008, there were 60 years of victories: overcoming obstacles, removing walls, pulling down barriers. Obama comes out of that process. &#xa0;He's a result of the &#xa0;years of struggle. He is the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. He ran a fast, able leg of the race we're in. He is a member of a team.</p> <p>So has the issue of race in American politics been transformed for all time? &#xa0;Absolutely not. The forces of hostility have in a strange way been reinvigorated, their fears have been revived, their anger has been rekindled, the mean spirits have resurged. America has a deep-seated commitment to unfounded racial fears and, win or lose, those fears will not go away.</p> <p>There are attempts to take the civil rights victories back. Our opponents are fighting the civil war of 1865. They're trying to pit states' rights against a more perfect union, the federal government. If Obama loses, they'll be empowered to undermine years of work. &#xa0;If Romney wins and puts right-wingers on the Supreme Court, the courts could rule to undermine the entire movement made by Dr King. Who appoints the next Supreme Court justices will determine the next 50 years of America. &#xa0;</p> <p>The scale of the president's achievement is not just a matter of his complexion, but the direction in which he has tried to take the country. He has done a huge amount, but a unified America could have achieved twice as much. Instead, the Republicans have been planning how to make him a one-term president since the time of his inauguration in January 2009. Their mission was not about job creation, bank reconstruction or to revive manufacturing. Their mission was not to rebuild. Their mission was at all costs to undermine his authority. &#xa0;</p> <p>If the president wins, conservative right-wingers will not stop fighting ideologically. &#xa0;We must maintain our struggle to prevail. We need to keep taking the nation forward by hope and never backward by fear. We need to keep hope alive.</p>",
  "<p>\"They said it was leaving me, the magic was leaving me: I don't think so,\" reckons Robbie Williams on Be a Boy, the opening salvo of his latest album \u2013 one that many will label a comeback. Given that Williams has sold out a run of <a href=\"http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a429187/robbie-williams-sells-out-three-o2-arena-shows-in-an-hour.html\" title=\"\">three shows at London's O2 Arena</a> this month in less than an hour, it's safe to say that the glitter of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/take-that\" title=\"\">Take That</a>'s record-breaking second reunion has stuck to the clown prince of British pop. If you cup your hand to your ear, the multi-tracked sigh of relief is audible all the way from LA. The formerly troubled star is now a happily married father of one, but his needy bluster continues to fascinate.</p> <p>The pixie dust doesn't quite settle uniformly on \u2026the Crown. After a pair of quirky records on which Williams chased a nostalgic synth-pop sound, <em>Take the Crown</em> marks a return to mainstream anthemics, with all the wearingly obvious moves that entails. His new co-writers are Tim Metcalfe and Flynn Francis of Australian band the Undercolours; his brother-in-law met them in a bar, or so <a href=\"http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a432230/robbie-williams-new-album-take-the-crown-was-written-in-eight-days.html\" title=\"\">Williams told <em>Music Week</em></a>. Collectively, Team Williams (producer Jacknife Lee is on board, too) struggle to find a copper-bottomed, gut-feel voice for Robbie 2.0, settling for a variety of puzzling gambits that miss as often as they hit.</p> <p>The single, <a href=\"http://www.muzu.tv/robbie-williams/candy-music-video/1523341/\" title=\"\">Candy</a>, written with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/gary-barlow\" title=\"\">Gary Barlow</a>, would better suit a boy band in a Caribbean time warp. But somehow, it looks as if it will re-establish Williams's presence in the charts today, regardless. The album's free-wheeling filler track, Hey Wow Yeah Yeah, is much more fun, even though its rush of vim mystifyingly fails to coalesce into a song. Adding to the tally of strange decisions, Be a Boy finds time for a cheesy sax solo teleported in from 1985.</p> <p>Talking of vim, some years ago, Williams was reported to be suffering from a mystery illness that many \u2013 including the singer himself \u2013 believed was depression. He was <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/3613725/.html\" title=\"\">diagnosed with low testosterone</a>. The hormone payload of Williams's regular injections hangs heavy on a couple of songs. Not Like the Others and All That I Want find Williams wiggling his eyebrows, and \"picking panties up off the floor\". You wouldn't go with the former track, but the latter pulls off an 80s club-floor Bryan Ferry impression with aplomb.</p> <p>Alongside the needy bluster, Williams has always been one of the more self-aware of British pop's big beasts; something of a meta-star as well as a mega-star who has sold more albums than any other British solo artist (his press release claims). As is his custom, many songs here are littered with contrite musings \u2013 not least Hunting for You, a song that tries epic U2 stadium balladry on for size. But even revelations like \"I am the wreckage of my past\" are trumped by <em>Take the Crown</em>'s riveting closer, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTKTNiTENpE\" title=\"\">Losers</a>.</p> <p>Offset against an acoustic guitar, Williams and his excellent female foil, Lissie, dissect the destructive nature of rivalry like a couple of backwoods Buddhists. \"There will always be someone better than you even if you're the best/So let's stop the competition now, or we will both be losers,\" it begins, calling a truce with the world. Earlier on, Williams's hub-hubba makes your flesh crawl a little; here, though, he raises proper goosebumps.</p>",
  "<p>There was an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/video/2012/oct/31/star-wars-lucasfilm-walt-disney-video\" title=\"\">amusing photograph in the papers</a> last week. It shows all the Disney theme park favourites \u2013 the human-sized but giant-headed mice, dogs and ducks \u2013 dressed up as <em>Star Wars </em>characters. Goofy is Darth Vader, Donald Duck is sporting elements of an imperial stormtrooper's uniform, Minnie Mouse is wearing a Princess Leia dress and Mickey is in full Jedi get-up, light sabre raised, giant immovable mousey grin turned perkily to the camera as he prepares to use the force to make Walt proud.</p> <p>But the most entertaining figure is in the middle \u2013 a rotund bespectacled old man, also holding a light sabre, dressed scruffily in shirt and jeans but with gleaming white trainers, a neat grey beard, and hair as precisely coiffed as a Mollie Sugden perm. His facial expression is somewhere between exhaustion, sorrow and bafflement, as if some kindly carers have taken him on a day trip of which he has little understanding. Of course in reality he fully grasps his surroundings, for this is billionaire film-maker George Lucas and the photo has been taken on the occasion of the sale of his movie empire, Lucasfilm, to Disney.</p> <p>I don't understand why he agreed to the picture if he wasn't going to enter into the spirit of it and make some attempt with his comparatively tiny human features to echo the massive Disney grins surrounding him. So maybe this snap caught him in a downbeat instant between exaggerated cheesy gurns. Or maybe he thought his glum look was more appropriate to the dignity of the great moment, like when a statesman signs an important treaty. Maybe he felt Mickey and co were lowering the tone with their gaping mouths.</p> <p>The announcement caused excitement among <em>Star Wars </em>fans, not just because it adds another range of funny outfits to the Disney parade wardrobe, but because, along with the purchase of Lucasfilm's renowned high-tech production companies, the Indiana Jones franchise and the rights to manufacture cuddly mouse-eared R2-D2s, this deal allows Disney to make a new <em>Star Wars</em> film. That's something which, very recently, seemed unlikely ever to happen again. Lucas told the <em>New York Times </em>earlier this year that he would never make another: \"Why would I make any more when everybody yells at you all the time?\" I think we can rule out his writing a column for the <em>Guardian </em>website any time soon.</p> <p>The guys at Disney have promised to bring out <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/oct/31/star-wars-7-return-jedi-again\" title=\"\"><em>Star Wars </em>episode seven in 2015 and to follow that with episodes eight and nine</a>. Thereafter their plan is to release a new film every two or three years pretty much indefinitely. Basically, they want <em>Star Wars </em>to go Bond.</p> <p>To Disney's investors, the prospect could hardly look more appetising. The latest release from the 50-year-old 007 franchise is being showered with critical praise and box-office cash. Having seen <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/oct/28/skyfall-james-bond-review\" title=\"\"><em>Skyfall</em></a>, I can't say I understand why. I mean, it's fine. It's probably an above-average Bond movie but then it benefits from both budgetary and technological possibilities that most of its predecessors lacked. It certainly isn't the \"best Bond ever\" as many are claiming. It is very nearly the longest Bond ever, narrowly beaten by Daniel Craig's first appearance in the role, <em>Casino Royale</em>. Maybe Craig has ambitions to be the longest-serving Bond but wants to get there in the fewest possible films.</p> <p>There's a lot wrong with it. It takes itself far too seriously, the suavity of the character is lost; the heartless charmer, the well-dressed psychopath who will unhesitatingly deploy violence to get what he wants \u2013 but who wants nothing more, due to an accident of his nature, than the furtherance of British national interests \u2013 has been replaced by a gnarled potato-headed bruiser haunted by his own past. Batman without the gear. I miss the jammy sod in the bow-tie whose toast always lands butter side up. Yet, for all this self-importance, the plot is still as daft as in the campest days of Roger Moore. I won't spoil the end for you \u2013 the writers have already done that \u2013 except to say: have courage, the film does, eventually, end.</p> <p>Comparisons with the Bond franchise are bound to make hard-core <em>Star Wars </em>fans nervous. Most would balk at an open-ended series of adventures vaguely set in the <em>Star Wars </em>universe but with the same variance of style, tone and competence that the Bond franchise has displayed. Will they have to endure different actors taking on the central characters? They've already seen Ewan McGregor struggle to fill Alec Guinness's shoes. But, as the roles of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia are taken forward, the opportunities for other actors to screw them up \u2013 or rather \"put their own stamp on them\" \u2013 are endless.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398814434\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/11/2/1351877794312/Mickey-Mouse-as-a-downed--001.jpg\" alt=\"Mickey Mouse as a downed Star Wars stormtrooper\" width=\"150\" height=\"203\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">  Illustration: David Foldvari</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Foldvari</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Will they have to cope with a moody Russell Crowe interpretation of Han in middle age, complete with inexplicable and shaky geordie accent? Will Maggie Smith turn an aged Queen Leia of the Universe into a wise-cracking old gossip? Will Mark Hamill be allowed to reprise the role he created or will he have to stand in line to audition with the likes of Bill Nighy, Steve Martin and that bloke from <em>Breaking Bad</em>? Or are Disney's real intentions hiding in plain sight in that photo? Are they going to give the galaxy to the Great Mouse?</p> <p>The prospect of a Disneyfied <em>Star Wars </em>would have appalled me 15 years ago. The thought of that corporate giant getting its weird three-fingered hands on the beloved space stories of my childhood would have seemed like sacrilege. Since then, of course, Jesus has desecrated his own altar and then set up as a money-changer in his own temple. And if you think that's a hyperbolic way of describing the fact that George Lucas made three disappointing sci-fi films, you need to get online more.</p> <p>As a feckless writer and comedian, I spend a lot of pub time railing against all the occasions when creative control is wrested from the people who have the ideas by the people who keep the accounts. So I find the story of the <em>Star Wars </em>franchise unsettling. Lucas had the successful idea and maintained rigid creative control over it, doubtless fending off the advances of avaricious predators who wanted to exploit or develop it differently. And yet that idea was more comprehensively ruined than if it had been left exposed to the worst and most idiotic corporate abuse imaginable.</p> <p>So what's to fear from Disney? They might make an entertaining film about a duck in space. It would be a lot edgier than Jar Jar Binks.</p> <p><em>David Mitchell's autobiography, </em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/tvandradio/9780007351725/david-mitchell-back-story\" title=\"\"><em>Back Story</em></a><em>, is out now.</em></p>",
  "<p>An independent British film company has won funding for six productions with a combined budget of $155m (\u00a396m), the <em>Observer</em> can reveal.</p> <p>The company's financial model is unusual in that investors are offered all six movies, spreading the risk significantly beyond the usual single film, and with a \"transparency\" that seeks to reassure investors stung by notorious abuses of tax schemes involving film investment.</p> <p>The producer, Miriam Segal, has a track record that includes the award-winning <em>Love is the Devil</em>, with Derek Jacobi as artist Francis Bacon, and <em>Good</em>, CP Taylor's Nazi drama with Oscar-nominated Viggo Mortensen.</p> <p>One of the films, a \u00a321m production entitled <em>The Infiltrator</em>, features a story of greed and deception surrounding the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International amid fraud allegations. \"It's 23 years old now, but has great contemporary resonance,\" she said. Others include a murder story, a drama about economic migrants, and an urban thriller with budgets of \u00a315m, \u00a38m and \u00a311m. \"Anything over \u00a39m outside a studio is a big thing in Britain,\" Segal said. Although a company such as Working Title, whose films include <em>Notting Hill</em>, also has a slate, they are backed by Universal, the US film giant.</p> <p>She plans to make \"intelligent but commercial feature films\", emulating the US independent model and shying away from more traditional \"British fare\" with \"too many films that three men and their dog will go and see\".</p> <p>Her announcement follows reports that HM Revenue &amp; Customs is investigating film schemes that exploit loopholes, which has rocked the confidence of investors who have also lost huge amounts of money.</p> <p>Her \"blueprint model\" involves the same sales agent, bank and equity source for all six films. Six UK-based businessmen have already ploughed \u00a32.5m just into developing the films.</p> <p>She said the Revenue has indicated preliminary approval for her tax model for its proper use of the Enterprise Investment Scheme, designed to help higher-risk business to raise funds. Investors will enjoy tax relief, but she said the model eliminates brokers, who in other film schemes were \"really\" selling just tax benefits.</p> <p>Segal said that investors are the lifeblood of independent filmmaking, but too many have been encouraged to invest unwisely. She said many potential investors say \"'Why the hell should I believe you, I've been so screwed in the past.\"</p> <p>\"But there are people trying to make films for the right reasons,\" she said. \"We're not all a bunch of shysters,\" she added. \"We're creating employment and economic investment. Our primary job is to protect their investment, not rip them off.\"</p> <p>Martin Rushton-Turner, founding investor and tax expert, said it means that these productions have been properly developed, unlike most independent films which are \"done on a hope and a prayer\".</p> <p>Scripts are already written, budgets worked out and they already have commitments from banks and the sales agent who will sell distribution rights, he said, noting that investors' money will only get drawn down when the banks give the green light for funding. They expect to raise 10% \u2013 up to \u00a310m \u2013 from investors, averaging \u00a3250,000 each, and the rest from the bank and distribution sales. He added: \"I have a tax background, so I'm pretty familiar with the uses and abuses of structured finance for tax. This is as good as you can get.\"News of the films was welcomed by Adrian Wootton, chief executive of Film London and the British Film Commission. Although he has yet to see details, he said: \"If they've managed to put together a slate like that with independent financing\u2026 it sounds very exciting.\"</p>",
  "<p>When those madcap Scandinavian satirists awarded the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19921072\" title=\"\">Nobel peace prize to the European Union</a>, they let everyone in on the joke by praising its commitment to \"reconciliation, democracy and human rights\". If the committee's 2012 citation were anything other than a spoof, you would have read denunciations of the rise of oppressive state power and neo-Nazism in Greece from concerned Euro commissioners long before now.</p> <p>The EU denounces threats to freedom of speech in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16390574\" title=\"\">Viktor Orb\u00e1n</a>'s Hungary with vigour. European politicians worry with good reason about the fate of independent institutions that stand in the way of the rabble-rousing regime. They notice the fascistic element in the new Hungarian right's flirtations with antisemitic and anti-Roma hatreds and its willingness to indulge the revanchist fantasy that Hungary can regain the lands it lost after the First World War. On the fate of Greek democracy there is silence, however, although there is much that Europe's leaders might talk about.</p> <p>You spot the pressure points of a failing state by looking at what it censors. In the case of Greece, the authorities' prosecution last week of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/01/greek-editor-kostas-vaevanis-acquitted\" title=\"\">Kostas Vaxevanis</a> showed that he had hit a pressure point with the accuracy of a doctor sticking a needle into a nerve. While Greeks live with austerity without end, while Greek GDP has shrunk by 4.5% in 2010 and 6.9% in 2011, and will shrink by a predicted 6.5% this year and 4.5% in 2013, the list of the names of 2,000 Greeks with bank accounts in Switzerland Vaxevanis published, suggested that the well-connected were escaping the burdens that fall on the masses.</p> <p>\"Instead of arresting the tax evaders and the ministers who had the list in their hands,\" thundered Vaxevanis in a call to arms that stirred the blood, \"they're trying to arrest the truth and freedom of the press.\"</p> <p>His acquittal on privacy law charges, though welcome, was less important than it appeared. It did not mean that freedom of the press was secure in Greece. Even in good times, independent journalism has rarely been a force in the land. Most Greek TV stations and newspapers are owned by either the state or plutocratic corporations, neither of which likes seeing corruption exposed. The leftwing daily, <em>Eleftherotypia</em>, which for all its faults and flirtations with terrorism at least challenged the oligarchs, filed for bankruptcy last year.</p> <p>Few of the employees of the remaining Greek news organisations reject the notion that they should keep quiet in the interests of holding on to their pay cheques. The state is hounding too many of those who do. \"We still have freedom of expression recognised by the law at a theoretical level,\" said Asteris Masouras, one of the free speech monitors at <a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/\" title=\"\">Global Voices</a>. \"On a practical level, well...\" And he proceeded to give me a list of instances of menacing forces intimidating reporters that would go on into the New Review section if I ran it in full.</p> <p>Where to begin? How about the self-defeating austerity policies the troika of the European Central Bank, European Commission and International Monetary Fund have forced on Greece? The authorities used an old warrant to arrest <a href=\"http://www.indexoncensorship.org/tag/spiros-karatzaferis/\" title=\"\">Spiros Karatzaferis</a>, after the journalist threatened to reveal confidential emails, that might have explained how the troika's alleged \"rescue package\" had pushed the country into depression.</p> <p>Police brutality is another pressure point, undoubtedly. The Greek left makes persistent allegations of collaboration between the supposed forces of law and order and the thugs in the neo-Nazi <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/26/golden-dawn-infiltrated-greek-police-claims\" title=\"\">Golden Dawn </a>movement. The <em>Guardian</em> ran reports that the police had beaten up anti-fascist demonstrators after they had confronted Golden Dawn. Yes, I know leftists call everyone \"fascists\" from headteachers to their mums and dads, but as Golden Dawn is building a mass movement while marching under a swastika, the term is correct on this occasion. The following day, Greek state TV replaced <a href=\"http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/336001\" title=\"\">Kostas Arvanitis and Marilena Katsimi</a>, the presenters of its morning news show, after they told managers they planned to follow up the <em>Guardian</em>'s claims. Another state TV reporter, Christos Dantis, has joined the ranks of the vanishing journalists. His editors assigned him to cover the celebrations of the centenary of the liberation of Thessaloniki from Ottoman rule. He was about to report on popular protests against the presence of the Greek prime minister and president in Greece's second city when his masters turned off the camera and cut to a more amenable hack.</p> <p>All the Greek journalists I spoke to emphasised that Athens was not Beijing or Tehran, but they described how the liberal certainties they once held now appeared flimsy. Helena Smith, our superb Athens correspondent, says that she feels as if she is standing on shifting sands. If the centrist coalition fails, and the troika's punitive demands have condemned it to failure, then the left opposition in Syrzia will probably take over. After that, Golden Dawn, maybe? No one knows. Nothing is unthinkable in a climate of fear and hopelessness.</p> <p>One can say with certainty that old alliances between extreme political and extreme religious movements are reviving. Hence, last month Christian fanatics and neo-Nazis (and the difference between the two is fine) protested against a \"blasphemous\" play with a homosexual theme in Athens. The theatre's management duly pulled it. Greek television cut a scene from <em>Downton Abbey</em> that featured a gay kiss. No one can explain why but a country that censors <em>Downton Abbey</em> on any grounds other than literary taste is in grave trouble.</p> <p>British Eurosceptics do not understand that the European Union once offered an escape to a liberal future for the peoples of Europe. When I visited Athens in the early 1980s, the old could remember fighting the Nazi occupation and the young had grown up in and on occasion fought the military dictatorship the colonels imposed. Joining the European Union meant saying goodbye to all of that. Now poverty, fear, suppression and state intimidation are back.</p> <p>You can blame the corruption Greek society tolerated. You can blame the bankers for the crash. But you must also apportion blame to Europe's politicians and bureaucrats who accepted Greece (and the rest of southern Europe) into a single currency area that has put them at a permanent competitive disadvantage and refused to write off debts Greece can never repay.</p> <p>No wonder they stay silent about the abuse of the human rights the Nobel prize committee insisted European integration guaranteed. Greece is the Eurocrats' very own Weimar on the Aegean. They helped build it.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron is facing huge embarrassment after details of intimate texts he exchanged with the former News International chief Rebekah Brooks emerged on Saturday.</p> <p>The existence of the messages has been at the centre of a row between Labour MP Chris Bryant and Cameron for several weeks and the contents will be a thorn in the prime minister's side. In one message, Cameron thanks Brooks for letting him ride one of her family's horses, saying it was \"fast, unpredictable and hard to control but fun\", it is claimed.</p> <p>In another, it is reported that Brooks, who is standing trial next year on charges of phone hacking and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, tells the Tory leader that she felt so emotional listening to his conference speech she \"cried twice\", adding: \"Will love 'working together'.\"</p> <p>The messages are part of a cache of texts and emails between Downing Street and Brooks handed over to Lord Justice Leveson's inquiry into media ethics by Downing Street and Brooks. In one, Cameron writes: \"The horse CB [Charlie Brooks] put me on. Fast, unpredictable and hard to control but fun.\" He signed off \"DC\".</p> <p>Bryant tweeted: \"These new texts are the tip of an iceberg.\" He also confirmed he has written to Leveson demanding that he publish all the texts and emails between the pair. Separately, the <em>Observer</em> understands there may have been as many as 150 messages exchanged between the two over a number of months, many of which would prove to be a considerable embarrassment to the government.</p> <p>Only a small number of the messages have so far been made public, leading to claims by Bryant, a former Europe minister, of a cover-up.</p> <p>A furious Cameron rejected a demand in the House of Commons by Bryant two weeks ago to disclose all the texts and emails exchanged with Brooks, whose husband, the racehorse trainer Charlie Brooks, has been friends with Cameron since they both attended Eton. The prime minister has refused to address Bryant's complaints on the basis that he broke an embargo on details disclosed to the Leveson inquiry and is said to have refused to apologise.</p> <p>But in a recent exchange, Bryant said: \"When the truth comes out, you won't be smiling.\"</p> <p>On Saturday it was also said that Bryant claims to have had contact with a No\u200910 \"mole\" involved in compiling Cameron's texts and emails, whom the Labour MP says has confirmed their \"salacious\" nature. Both texts revealed on Saturday are said to have been sent in October 2009, shortly after Brooks left her job as editor of the <em>Sun</em> and became chief executive of News International, which owns the paper.</p> <p>They shed further light on the extraordinarily close relationship between Cameron and Brooks, both members of the \"Chipping Norton set\" based around their Oxfordshire homes.Brooks told the Leveson inquiry earlier this year that Cameron signed some of his missives to her \"LOL\" \u2013 until she told him it meant \"Laugh Out Loud\", not \"Lots Of Love\".The disclosures are bound to lead to further Labour party demands that all messages between the Brooks and Cameron are made public so the true nature of their relationship can be seen.</p> <p>Cameron and Brooks met 22 times in a six-year period, an average of once every three months. Brooks said that at the height of the phone-hacking scandal he sent her a morale-boosting \"keep your head up\" message, and expressed his regret he could not be more loyal to her in public.</p>",
  "<p>This is a documentary about the veteran Ugandan gay-rights activist David Kato (in Uganda, gay men and women are known as \"kuchus\"). One year into filming Kato's struggle to fight the efforts of Ugandan politicians to introduce some of the most repressive anti-homosexual legislation the world has ever seen, the unthinkable happened: he was brutally murdered. The film includes footage of his funeral, at which the village pastor tells his grieving friends that their own sexual sins make them culpable for Kato's death. <em>Call Me Kuchu</em> isn't terribly artful; it would work better on television than the big screen. But it tears at that heart all the same. Such horror, such bravery.</p>",
  "<p><strong>In a world of polished computers, the Raspberry Pi has arrived to remind us that, with nothing more than time, patience and an exposed circuit board, you can create almost anything. Here are a few of the projects RPi pioneers have devised over the past year.</strong></p> <h2><strong>1. NIXIE CLOCK</strong><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398711759\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/11/1/1351769832804/pi-projects---nixie-clock-002.jpg\" alt=\"pi projects - nixie clock\" width=\"460\" height=\"267\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">nixieclock.co.uk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: nixieclock.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You will need</strong> an RPi and SD card, a self-assembly <a href=\"http://www.nixieclock.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Nixie Clock kit</a> (or digital clock capable of accepting GPS or microcontroller data), a Wi-Fi dongle or ethernet cable.</p> <p>Nixie tube clocks, with their neon digits, are popular with nostalgic electronics fans. One such enthusiast, Martin Oldfield, has built a clock that receives Network Time Protocol data from the internet via the RPi, and is accurate to ten-thousandths of a second. <a href=\"http://mjo.tc/atelier/2012/08/ntp-nixie.html\" title=\"\">Online instructions:</a> mjo.tc/atelier/2012/08/ntp-nixie. html</p> <p><strong>Difficulty: 4</strong></p> <h2><strong>2. ROBOT SLAVE</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>You will need</strong> an RPi and SD card, and (for a voice-recognition robot) a USB robotic arm, a USB microphone, a USB hub and voice-recognition software such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_(software)\" title=\"\">Julius</a>.</p> <p>Robots are a talking point across the RPi forums. One precocious aerospace engineer has used an RPi to run a voice-recognition program and now has a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_U_v9tRD68k\" title=\"\">robotic arm</a> literally at his command, while another developer has built <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PiC0Mp8u4A\" title=\"\">\"Roberta\"</a>, a highly sophisticated two-wheeled RPi robot who perpetually responds to gyroscopes to balance herself.</p> <p><strong>Difficulty</strong> <strong>8-10</strong></p> <h2><strong>3. WEATHER STATION</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>You will need</strong> an RPi and SD card, a home weather-station, a monitor and a USB cable.</p> <p>Britain's amateur meteorologists are already using the RPi to process weather data, highlighting once again the immediate, perhaps unsurprising proclivity felt by the hobbyist community for the tiny computer. With the RPi, having a single computer dedicated to a weather station is neither extravagant nor physically awkward, and several <a href=\"http://www.weather.dragontail.co.uk/index.php?page=station_setup\" title=\"\">tutorials</a> already exist to explain the necessary coding to prepare a web-accessible, personalised weather forecast.</p> <p><strong>Difficulty</strong> <strong>3</strong></p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <h2><strong>4. ROCKET LAUNCHER</strong><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398711760\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/11/1/1351769573283/pi-projects---rocket-laun-001.jpg\" alt=\"pi projects - rocket launcher\" width=\"150\" height=\"147\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">dreamcheeky.com</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: dreamcheeky.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You will need</strong> an RPi and SD card, a powered USB hub, a USB rocket launcher.</p> <p>This invention is designed to intimidate and humiliate co-workers who make mistakes while writing code. When set up in an office environment, the RPi detects errors in software development and automatically fires a foam missile at the offending employee. The program, nicknamed Retaliation, is described by its creator as working on \"a deep psychological level to offer productivity improvements\". Its <a href=\"http://itr8r.tumblr.com/post/31840231144/raspberry-pi-retaliation\" title=\"\">credentials</a> are listed online, with a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EGk2rvZe8A\" title=\"\">video</a> showing it in action.</p> <p><strong>Difficulty</strong> <strong>4</strong></p> <h2><strong>5. PORTABLE/IN-CAR PC</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>You will need</strong> an RPi and SD card, an adapted power supply to run off a dashboard cigarette lighter or a battery pack and a small monitor.</p> <p>It is said that Julian Assange used to travel with a desktop PC in his rucksack. He could have done with the RPi, which weighs 45g (1.6oz) and can be adapted to function as a portable or in-car computer. One motorist has already linked up his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSTCdjA82fg\" title=\"\">RPi to a nifty sliding screen</a>, and several others are working on ways of accessorising their dashboards to incorporate RPi-run GPS and media systems.</p> <p><strong>Difficulty</strong> <strong>2-7</strong></p> <h2><strong>6. JUKEBOX</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>You will need</strong> an RPi and SD card, a mini-speaker, a powered USB hub, a USB battery, various free media software.</p> <p>The giddy hope of building an iPod replacement from an RPi has yet to be completely realised, but a French computer science lecturer named Tarek Ziad\u00e9 has designed a portable, self-contained jukebox which can be controlled remotely from other computers. His <a href=\"http://blog.ziade.org/2012/07/01/a-raspberry-pi-juke-box-how-to/\" title=\"\">website</a> dispenses coding tips so the end product can run smoothly, and he has built a Lego case to contain the components.</p> <p><strong>Difficulty</strong> <strong>7</strong></p> <h2><strong>7. RADIO</strong></h2> <p><strong>You will need</strong> an RPi and SD card, a USB Wi-Fi adapter, various free media software, a battery-powered speaker and an Adafruit \"Cobbler\" (see glossary, right below).</p> <p>The proliferation of internet radio stations allows those with even the most outlandish music tastes to find their fellows out there in cyberspace. One exhaustive blogger named contractorwolf has built a successful RPi radio which shuffles between his favourite stations at the touch of a button. Hearteningly, he had no experience of programming in Linux before he built his radio so there is hope for the rest of us.</p> <p><strong>Difficulty</strong> <strong>6</strong></p> <h2><strong>8. ARCADE GAME</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>You will need</strong> an RPi and SD card, a monitor, a cabinet to contain them, gaming software.</p> <p>Shea Silverman of Florida has demonstrated his love of vintage video games by building an RPi into a miniature replica of an arcade game circa 1991, complete with a fully functioning version of <em>Street Fighter II</em>. Thousands of old arcade games have been preserved through an application called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAME\" title=\"\">MAME</a>, and <a href=\"http://blog.sheasilverman.com/raspberry-pi-emulation/\" title=\"\">Silverman's blog</a> outlines how to install MAME on the RPi as well as some more recent games including <em>Cave Story</em> and <em>Quake III</em>.</p> <p><strong>Difficulty 3</strong></p> <h2><strong>9. BABY MONITOR</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398711761\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/11/1/1351769639619/pi-projects---baby-monito-001.jpg\" alt=\"pi projects - baby monitor\" width=\"150\" height=\"210\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You will need</strong> an RPi and SD card, a webcam with microphone, an ethernet cable or Wi-Fi dongle.</p> <p>The keenest parents on the internet are scrambling to <a href=\"http://jeremyblythe.blogspot.it/2012/05/raspberry-pi-webcam.html\" title=\"\">design the first RPi-powered baby monitor</a> with a live audio and video stream so they can check on their offspring from the office. The most enterprising have suggested plugging the RPi into the TV, so if you hear a cry through the speaker, you can simply flip over to the \"baby channel\" rather than go all the way upstairs.</p> <p><strong>Difficulty</strong> <strong>7</strong></p> <h2><strong>10. HOME-BREWED BEER</strong></h2> <p><strong>You will need</strong> an RPi and SD card, an Arduino, temperature sensors, a fridge, yeast, hops.</p> <p>Making beer is a delicate process requiring vigilance and tenacity. During fermentation, if your beer slips one degree above or below the correct temperature, the whole batch will be spoiled and it's back to square one. Which is why a Dutchman named Elco Jacobs has designed an intricate program, run off the RPi, to detect the temperature of his nascent brews and automatically correct the temperature of his fridge accordingly. BrewPi is an open-source project so there is a <a href=\"http://brewpi.com/brewpi-released-all-source-code-online-a-wiki-a-forum-a-bug-tracker-lets-go/\" title=\"\">website</a> with in-depth instructions explaining how to adapt the RPi and build the program, which includes a function by which you can track the progress of your beer and even adapt the temperature over the internet. Jacobs himself has already set about creating his first computer-moderated beer, which he plans to name Raspbian Wheaty.</p> <p><strong>Difficulty 7</strong></p> <h2><strong>11. BIRDBOX</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398711762\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/11/1/1351769430303/Pi-projects---a-birdhouse-001.jpg\" alt=\"Pi projects - a birdhouse\" width=\"150\" height=\"156\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Birdhouse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You will need</strong> an RPi and SD card, a Pi-Face (see glossary), 2 infrared LEDs and two light detectors, a small webcam and a wooden box with a compartment to contain the RPi.</p> <p>The students and staff of the University of Manchester's Computer Science department, the Raspberry Pi's most innovative trailblazers, have designed a DIY nesting box which can photograph birds and amalgamate data relating to their behaviour. They have even written a function which can send you a tweet whenever a bird enters or leaves the box. Their online video shows the finished birdbox and explains how to power the RPi and the Pi-Face as well as providing them with internet access using only one ethernet cable.</p> <p><strong>Difficulty</strong> <strong>5</strong></p> <h2><strong>12. NEAR-SPACE CRAFT</strong></h2> <p><strong>You will need</strong> an RPi and SD card, a hydrogen balloon, a USB webcam, a GPS, a heatsink, a battery pack, permission from the Civil Aviation Authority.</p> <p>As keen on puns as it is on programming, the RPi community has produced nothing so spectacular as the Pi in the Sky, a huge hydrogen balloon carrying an RPi to an altitude of 40,000 metres \u2013 a full kilometre higher than the top of Felix Baumgartner's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/14/felix-baumgartner-lands-safely-record\" title=\"\">Red Bull Stratos descent</a>. Thanks to a webcam, it boasts the highest live images \u2013 picked up by receivers run by zealous enthusiasts all over the country \u2013 ever recorded during an unmanned amateur flight. Designed by Dave Akerman and friends, it was launched in Berkshire, and after its balloon burst at the edge of space, the RPi \"safely landed in long grass\" somewhere near Didcot. If the wiring and programming, itemised on <a href=\"http://www.daveakerman.com/?p=592\" title=\"\">Akerman's website</a>, seem too dauntingly complex, the flight should at least illustrate the possibilities available to any RPi fanatics whimsical enough to pursue them.</p> <p><strong>Difficulty</strong> <strong>9 </strong></p> <h2><strong>GLOSSARY</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>Adafruit \"Cobbler\" </strong>A special printed circuit board with a ribbon cable, custom-designed to simplify the Raspberry Pi's otherwise fiddly and confusing hardware pins.</p> <p><strong>Arduino </strong>A microcontroller computer which, combined with the Raspberry Pi, allows you to control a wider range of hardware.</p> <p><strong>Heatsink </strong>A hardware component which helps cool the computer and keep it stable.</p> <p><strong>Linux </strong>A secure open-source operating system which runs on the RPi in a distribution package called Debian. A version of Debian called <a href=\"http://www.raspbian.org/\" title=\"\">Raspbian</a> has already been developed with modifications specific to the RPi.</p> <p><strong>Open-source </strong>Open-source software is software which is distributed with accessible and visible source code so that you can see how it works and even adapt it yourself.</p> <p><strong>Pi-Face:</strong>An interface chip designed by the University of Manchester to improve the RPi's auxiliary capabilities.</p> <p><strong>SD card </strong>The hard-drive of an RPi is provided by an SD card, which must be bought separately.</p> <p><strong>USB hub </strong>A splitter to turn the RPi's single USB port into as many as you need.</p>",
  "<p>After trying and failing to find <a href=\"http://jessicaennis.net\" title=\"\">Jessica Ennis</a> in the <a href=\"http://eis2win.co.uk\" title=\"\">English Institute of Sport</a> in Sheffield, a female athlete helps me track her down. \"There she is,\" she says. Which is just as well as I'm not entirely convinced I'd have recognised the slight figure in tracksuit bottoms and a hooded top.</p> <p>I'm 5ft 10in, Ennis is just 5ft 5in, and with her muscles covered up and her six-pack under wraps, she seems teeny tiny, all skinny shoulders and narrow hips. If I hadn't seen her in action with my own eyes, and I didn't know she was the Olympic heptathlon champion, a&#xa0;sport which essentially involves being world class in seven different disciplines, I honestly would have said that I&#xa0;could have had her in an arm-wrestling match.</p> <p>One of her trainers, Mick Thompson, recalls seeing her at an athletics open day which her parents had taken her to age 10, and says that, \"She stood out a mile\u2026 she was probably one of most talented youngsters I've ever seen.\" We've become used to seeing these amazing physical freaks, the Michael Phelpses and Serena Williamses of the world, but Jessica Ennis just seems to be a perfect distillation of pure athleticism and absolute willpower.</p> <p>In her about-to-be-published autobiography, <em>Unbelievable</em>, she recounts how before her first event in the Olympics, her mum sent her \"usual\" text message: \"Don't let those big girls push you around.\" They didn't, of course. She didn't let them. Over the course of two days, and seven events, Ennis beat off the big girls and took gold in the Olympic stadium in a&#xa0;moment of high emotion in the middle of what came to be known as Super Saturday.</p> <p>Two and a half months on, and, she says, \"It still hasn't worn off.\" Has she had post-Olympic blues? \"People ask me that,\" she says. \"They say, isn't it an anti-climax? But it's been the best experience ever. And I'm still so busy trying to fit everything in. But it's still amazing. Every time my dad comes around, he's, like: 'You're an Olympic champion!' Everyone is still on a&#xa0;high.\"</p> <p>But, she says, it's \"weird\" when she goes out. \"You can hear people talking about you. And sometimes they see me and just go: 'Jessica Ennis!' like that in my face and then don't know what to say. But everyone is so sweet. They all just want to tell me their story. 'I was there!' Or 'I watched you and you made me cry.' That's one I've heard a few times.\"</p> <p>Jessica Ennis wasn't just carrying her own hopes and dreams into the Olympic stadium, she had the wonderful but terrible psychic burden of carrying all of the rest of ours, too, because spontaneously and without actually asking her, the media, sponsors and Olympic organisers collectively decided that she was the face of the Games.</p> <p>\"I don't really know how that happened,\" she says. \"One journalist asked me, 'Did you apply for that?' Like it'd been advertised or something. But, of course, I&#xa0;didn't. I really don't know why. It just sort of happened.\"</p> <p>But everyone else knows exactly why. Her Olympic performance in the heptathlon was nothing short of spectacular. But it was her post-Olympic performance, that lovely genuine smile she has and the absolute heartfelt joy she showed in winning that cemented her reputation as one of the nicest people in sport.</p> <p>But the pressure! In retrospect, and having read her autobiography, I'm amazed she didn't simply crack up. Or flee to the Priory. Or develop a cocaine habit. It's no coincidence, it seems to me, that in the ladies' loo at the Institute of Sport there's a poster with a tense-looking woman on it. \"Feeling under pressure?\" it asks. \"Ring the Samaritans.\"</p> <p>In Sheffield alone, she would pass five massive banner posters of herself on her way to training. She recalls how she once went out for a bag of chips and thought better of it when she saw herself blown up 20 times lifesize above the chip shop, the acme of physical perfection, and \"drove on to Sainsbury's instead\". The first thing that athletes arriving into Heathrow saw was a field-sized portrait of her face next to the runway. And arriving in Stratford, one athlete tweeted that it was like landing \"in a Jessica Ennis theme park\".</p> <p>What were we thinking? It seems to me that if you were trying to make someone crack under the strain, that's roughly the way you'd go about doing it. \"I'm not going to lie,\" she says. \"This year has been really hard. I've always said that you're obviously doing something right if you have got pressure on you. But it was hard. It's difficult when you're in the thick of it, to fully comprehend, but when you step out and look back, I wouldn't want to do it again. Not unless I knew the outcome. It was the not knowing what was going to happen.\"</p> <p>It's easy to think now that somehow it was all pre-ordained, but four years ago her training was going swimmingly and she was on track for the Beijing Olympics, when in a&#xa0;matter of seconds an injury changed all that. It was the darkest point of her career, though. \"It changed me as an athlete,\" she says, and has made her success now all the sweeter.</p> <p>The attention had its bonuses, of course: photo-shoots in LA with David Beckham and a 5-litre Jaguar from one of her sponsors. She's still only 26 and yet she's handled everything \u2013 the pressure, the nerves, the stress, and her glorious success \u2013 with great poise and grace.</p> <p>And now there's <em>Unbelievable</em>, her memoir. In it, she describes how being small hasn't just defined her physically, but also mentally. It opens with an account of how she was bullied at junior school. \"I was just different. I&#xa0;was such a scraggy little thing. And there were these two big girls who just used to pick on me.\" And, how, even now, going into competition against bigger, stronger athletes, the memory of that still spurs her on.</p> <p>I can't help feeling that it's hammed up a&#xa0;little in the book. Ennis's autobiography was ghost-written by Rick Broadbent, a&#xa0;sportswriter on the <em>Times</em>, and while the bullying story forms a neat narrative to begin the book, I'm not entirely convinced of its significance. Given the lack of psychodrama in Ennis's life \u2013 she's close to her parents and her sister, had loving and supportive grandparents, her only experience of racism was one lone, not terribly traumatic incident at school, and she has been in the same long-term relationship for the past seven years \u2013 it has a slight clutching-at-straws quality.</p> <p>The one thing that became apparent about Ennis during the Games was how normal she is. How humble she's been about her success and how grounded she is, still living in Sheffield where she grew up. But she's also, as she describes herself, \"a competitive animal\". And you just cannot underestimate the drive, determination and sheer dogged hard work that has gone into her career.</p> <p>\"Everyone else drifted away,\" she says. \"Every year, I'd be training with a different group, because people didn't stick at it.\" And yet, Ennis did. She can't quite explain why. Her mother is quite competitive, she says. And her father did a bit of sprinting in Jamaica \u2013 where he was born \u2013 as a boy. \"But then again, my sister absolutely hates sport and she was brought up exactly the same as me.\"</p> <p>Because Ennis is so likable and easy going, it's easy to forget this essential fact about her: the steel that enabled her, after two days of competition, physically exhausted, facing her worst and least-favourite discipline \u2013 the 800m \u2013 and knowing that unless she fell over she'd done enough to win the gold medal, to still find the drive to overtake the naturally faster runners ahead of her.</p> <p>\"I know. It is a contradiction,\" she says. \"I&#xa0;think that's one of the first things you'd say if you met me, that I am just nice and smiley. And that's how I might appear when I'm not competing. But I'm totally different when it comes to sport. It's just something that seems to be within me. It's not external or visual. But it's within me. You have to be totally up for it and motivated otherwise you just wouldn't win. But it's not something that a&#xa0;lot of people see. Apart from maybe my family.\"</p> <p>There's a tiny hint of this on <a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=8wBZ6PiCnd4\" title=\"\">YouTube</a> in a video that features an interview with her mother in which she says that, for a time, she thought that Jessica was \"selfish\" because her training \u2013 a strict, six-day-a-week schedule \u2013 and her needs took priority over everything else. \"I know I saw that. I was, like, 'Mum!' But she's right. I admit it. I do have to be quite a&#xa0;selfish person because of what I do. You simply have to be. It's an individual sport and you have to be constantly looking at what's best for you. And everything has to fit in with where you want to get to. I think that changes through life, but when you're in the thick of it, you do have to be like that.\"</p> <p>Ennis studied psychology at university, and even wrote her dissertation on \"self- regulation\", or self-discipline, and yet there's a&#xa0;sense that she is in some ways a mystery to herself. \"I've always known what I wanted. I've always wanted to be on top of that podium.\" But why or how she's become the master of \"self-regulation\" that she is is as unknowable to herself, it seems, as to anybody. In her memoir, she says she tried basketball, but team sports weren't for her. She always wanted the responsibility of controlling her own destiny.</p> <p>The cruelty of sport is that, in the end, however hard you try it's not entirely down to you. In the book, Ennis mentions <a href=\"http://phyllisagbo.co.uk\" title=\"\">Phyllis Agbo</a>. They competed as juniors against each other, Agbo consistently beating her, and the one \"who everyone thought would go on to do great things\". I Google Agbo and find she suffered injury after injury and never made the squad.</p> <p>\"It's such a fine line. I know Phyllis really well. And she was the one who everyone thought would make it. But different things happen. And, as hard as you work, you still need luck. Before the Olympics I&#xa0;was in the best shape of my life, but I really, really needed some luck. And I&#xa0;got it.\"</p> <p>ENNIS shares another trait with many successful athletes: a close and supportive family. Her mother is from Derbyshire farming stock and met her Jamaican-born father at the age of 19. He was 14 years older than her, and, just a few months later, she found herself pregnant with Jessica. \"It wasn't very easy for them. They never had a lot of money.\"</p> <p>Ennis started going out with her fianc\u00e9, Andy, a construction manager, at 19 \u2013 he was three years ahead of her at school \u2013 and he is, she says, \"very understanding\". He'd have to be, given her schedule, and the Denis Thatcher, fading-into-the-background nature of his role. But that's been her other luck. \"He's been a really big part of my success. At the end of the day, I come home to him.\"</p> <p>And despite offers of scholarships in America, Ennis has remained true and constant to Sheffield. One of the most satisfying incidents in the book is where the head of <a href=\"http://uka.org.uk\" title=\"\">UK Athletics</a>, Charles van Commenee, tries to lure her, and then force her, down to London. \"I wasn't having it. I just knew it wasn't the right thing for me.\"</p> <p>It's a rare glimpse of the other side of her. The resolute, take-no-prisoners, not-backing-down-no-way-never side. \"I dislike conflict, so I do try and steer clear of arguments,\" she says. \"Apart from with my coach. Who I literally have an argument with every day.\"</p> <p>Ah yes, Toni Minichiello or Chell, as she calls him. She's been with him since she was 13 and their relationship is one of constant feuds and battles. Despite the fact that she studied psychology, she says she's no great fan of sports psychology, or \"stating the obvious\" as she calls it, but at one point she and Chell took themselves for what sounds like couples counselling. \"We just had to learn how to communicate better. We are like an old married couple, basically.\"</p> <p>And, here they are, together again. The Olympics was everything Ennis ever dreamed of, and more. And going back into training \"has been hard. I can't deny it. But I'm five weeks in and it's gradually getting easier. I can feel my fitness returning. It was just such a big year last year. And I just wanted to make sure that I&#xa0;did everything right. And this year, the Olympics has gone, and I've won! And now I've got to get back into training, and I&#xa0;do think about Rio, but I can't think about it seriously yet, it's just too soon.\"</p> <p>Next year will bring the world championships \u2013 as well as her wedding. Andy proposed two years ago, but all plans were shelved until after the Olympics. She wants a family, \"and I don't want to leave it too late,\" she says, but \"I've also got more I want to achieve\". She says she just thinks she'll know when the time is right to stop.</p> <p>\"Men can go on as long as they like and still have a nice set-up at home. It is harder for women. But then that's true whatever career you choose. You have to make a choice. If you go away from your career you come back knowing you might be a lower level. That's a&#xa0;choice that each woman has to make. For me it's been so important to achieve what I set out to achieve first.\"</p> <p>The Olympics was, however, a great boost for women in sport. Ennis is a natural diplomat, but she says that \"a lot of people noticed the inequality with things like the <a href=\"http://bbc.co.uk/sport/0/sports-personality/\" title=\"\"><em>Sports Personality of the Year</em></a> awards last year when there wasn't a single woman nominated\". And while it's immensely cheering to learn that she beat \"Kim Kardashian and Kelly Brook\" to win the title of \"most desirable celebrity body\", less cheering is the fact that if you put her name into YouTube there's no end of really quite pervy stuff out there.</p> <p>She giggles when I mention it. \"I&#xa0;find it quite funny,\" she says. What about 'Jessica Ennis and her perfect bum tribute', I ask. It's the first video that comes up. \"Ugh. I've actually seen that,\" she says. \"It's all slow motion. That freaked me out a little bit.\" It's not surprising. The first comment beneath the video says: \"This is basically just a very strange and creepy video.\"</p> <p>But if you scratch the surface, you'll find salacious montages of women athlete's bodies all over YouTube. It's incredibly depressing in all sorts of ways. Sport should surely be the one area of public life where women's bodies are judged for what they can do, not what they look like \u2013 but Ennis is sanguine. \"I think it happens in every walk of life, doesn't it? None of us have gone into sport because we want to be looked at like that. We wear very little, but it's not for that reason. It's for performance reasons. It's a&#xa0;bit of a strange one.\"</p> <p>Success has mostly been strange-good for Ennis, rather than strange-strange. She's almost universally loved. The nation's newest sweetheart. It's not difficult to see why she became the poster girl for our British 21st-century Olympics: hard-working but good-humoured, humble but determined, the smiling multicultural embodiment of how we'd like to see ourself as a&#xa0;nation. And when, despite the pressure, she came good, on Super Saturday, it's not a huge stretch to see that somehow, we did, too.</p> <p>Unbelievable<em> by Jessica Ennis is published on 8&#xa0;November by Hodder &amp; Stoughton at \u00a320.

  "<p>Six years ago, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/william-friedkin\" title=\"\">William Friedkin</a>'s magnificently raw adaptation of Tracy Letts's paranoid psycho-thriller <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/115302/bug\" title=\"\"><em>Bug</em></a> managed to slip under the radar of most UK filmgoers, thanks in part to the bemusement of its distributor, which simply couldn't figure out how to sell the damned thing. Not so his next Letts collaboration, <strong>Killer Joe</strong> (2011, Entertainment One, 18), a deep-fried, jet black slice of twisted Texan gothic that has attracted the kind of attention and notoriety that Friedkin has not enjoyed since the days of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080569/\" title=\"\"><em>Cruising</em></a>.</p> <p>Boasting barnstorming ensemble performances from Matthew McConaughey, Gina Gershon, Thomas Haden Church and rising star Juno Temple, this tale of trailer park lowlifes conspiring variously to bump off and/or pimp family members became an outre cause celebre thanks in part to a grotesquely prolonged scene of quasi-sexual chicken-bone abuse upon which an attention-grabbing PR campaign was built. Ironically, it's the least well-judged part of a movie that veers throughout between smartly psychotic satirical dialogue and hackneyed virgin/whore gender role cliches.</p> <p>At its best, this reminds us what an unruly force of cinematic nature Friedkin can still be, encouraging a level of fearlessness in his cast that is electrifyingly captured by cinematographer <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/name/nm0221042/\" title=\"\">Caleb Deschanel</a>. Having cut his teeth adapting Pinter and Mart Crowley for the screen, the director still knows how to make a stage play look anything but stagey and there's little sense here of the text's theatrical origins. Good, too, to know that at the age of 77 Friedkin can still infuriate and alarm as much as ever, showing little sign of mellowing with age, and resolutely refusing to cut the movie to avoid a box-office-killing NC-17 rating in the US. The result is a visceral assault, impressively spiky and scuzzy, although anyone impressed by <em>Killer Joe's</em> down-and-dirty edge should also seek out its predecessor, which remains the real mother lode.</p> <p>Commercially speaking, neither of the Friedkin/Letts collaborations can hold a candle to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/84683/rules.of.engagement\" title=\"\"><em>Rules of Engagement</em></a>, a military courtroom drama that (briefly) topped the US box-office chart in 2000, and featured a typically committed performance by Tommy Lee Jones. There's none of that commitment in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Men-Black-III-DVD-Copy/dp/B003P9WHZO/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351682608&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><strong>Men in Black 3</strong></a><strong> </strong>(2012, Sony, PG), in which TLJ looks like a man world-wearily picking up the cheque while waiting for Josh Brolin to step into his time-travelling shoes and inject the missing zing as Agent K's younger self. Will Smith is as ebulliently bouncy as ever, and Emma Thompson makes the most of an all-too-fleeting cameo, but it's depressing to remember just how unexpectedly sparky the first movie was back in 1997 and how corporate this third instalment seems by comparison. For proof, check out the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Men-Black-I-III-DVD-Copy/dp/B008D05XSS/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351683099&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><em>Men in Black </em>trilogy box set</a>, which is an object lesson in diminishing returns.</p> <p>You could be forgiven for dismissing the kookily entitled <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Seeking-Friend-End-World-DVD/dp/B008CP2DXW/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351683172&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><strong>Seeking a Friend for the End of the World</strong></a> (2012, Studio Canal, 15) as merely a romcom rehash of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/141827/melancholia\" title=\"\"><em>Melancholia</em></a> in which existential angst is replaced by a saccharine sweet faux-alternative sensibility. Yet for all its formulaic offbeat tics (the character who loves vinyl and suffers from a lovable sleep disorder etc) there's something oddly endearing about this quietly apocalyptic affair. Steve Carrell and Keira Knightley play it fairly straight as the mismatched couple thrown together (and apart) by impending Armageddon and Lorene Scafaria retains the deadpan likability of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/feb/01/nick-norahs-infinite-playlist-review\" title=\"\"><em>Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist</em></a> as she graduates from writer to writer-director. Nothing like the bomb that its box-office failure in the States suggested, this may be uneven fare but it's also sweet, touching and occasionally quite poignant.</p> <p>In the self-explanatorily titled <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Five-Year-Engagement-DVD-Jason-Segel/dp/B006LK8JPQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351684038&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><strong>The Five-Year Engagement</strong></a><strong> </strong>(2012, Universal, 15), Jason Segel and Emily Blunt negotiate elongated prenuptial ups and downs as her career subtly threatens his, with relationship-challenging results. There's a terrific 90-minute movie buried in this more than two-hour offering from the post-<em>Bridesmaids</em> Judd Apatow production stable, with the disintegration of co-writer Segel's character being overcranked for comic effect, undercutting the more recognisable reality of the movie's best observed low-key moments. It's a credit to Blunt that even when things get dramatically out of hand her droll delivery and naturalistic responses stop the narrative from completely crossing the line of credibility. Rhys Ifans has fun as a lecherous academic whose predatory shtick is skin-crawlingly spot on, and the laugh count is satisfactorily high. A relief, too, that (in a break from Apatow tradition) there's no gross-out talking point, Segel and his Muppets collaborator Nicholas Stoller settling instead for a scene in which adult matters are discussed in the voices of Elmo and the Cookie Monster to wonderfully strange effect.</p>",
  "<p>Michael Haneke likes to say that his films are easier to make than to watch. Cast and crew have fun, but he expects his audience to be disturbed, affronted, even sickened. \"On the set I make jokes,\" he said when we met in Paris to discuss <em>Amour</em>, which deservedly won him the Palme d'Or at Cannes this year. \"I can't get too involved, or it turns into sentimental soup. I try to keep it light.\"</p> <p>What he tried to alleviate while making <em>Amour</em> was a grim anatomy of elderly debility and dementia, complete with incontinence, forced feeding and the eventual stench of putrefaction. The film follows the decline of an octogenarian musician, who after a stroke is nursed at home by her adoring but increasingly angry and bewildered husband. The roles are played, as Haneke said, by \"two great actors who go beyond acting. They both knew that this situation will concern them in their own lives in the very near future\". Emmanuelle Riva is now 85, Jean-Louis Trintignant is 81; because films from the 1950s preserve their nubile youth \u2013 Riva in bed with her Japanese lover in <em>Hiroshima Mon Amour</em>, Trintignant worshipping the bosom of Bardot in <em>And God Created Woman</em> \u2013 it's alarming to see them now with stiff but fragile limbs and worn, sagging faces. Their anxiety is unfeigned, their injuries not acted. Riva had to strip naked for a scene in which a bossy nurse bathes her; she didn't believe, until the moment came, that Haneke was really going to oblige her to undress. Trintigant's arduous limp is the memento of a motorcycle accident, and to compound his afflictions he broke his hand during the filming.</p> <p><em>Amour</em> is stark and sometimes brutal, as you would expect from a director who specialises in emotional extremity. Haneke's <em>The Seventh Continent</em> is about the doggedly meticulous suicide of an entire family, <em>Funny Games</em> about the torture and slaughter of another household; <em>The Piano Teacher</em> studies the hang-ups of a heroine who slices her genitalia with a razor and begs to be whipped. But the new film has a grave compassion not seen before in his work. Its subject, as Haneke put it, is \"How do I deal with the fact that someone I love is suffering?\", and its private source is the agony of the aunt who brought Haneke up when his feckless parents, both actors, realised they had no talent for child-raising. At the age of 92, crippled by rheumatism, his aunt overdosed on sleeping pills. Haneke found her in time, and rushed her to the hospital. She had previously begged him to help her die; he pointed out that since he was her heir, he might have ended in prison. A year after her first attempt, she swallowed more pills and put herself out of her misery. Though the circumstances in <em>Amour</em> are different, Haneke passes on his personal dilemma to Trintignant, who copes in his own mad, heroic way.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6Tuc3zjvJU8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6Tuc3zjvJU8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Earlier Haneke films have dealt with a casual, motiveless murder in <em>Benny's Video</em>, and the indiscriminate shooting of a crowd in <em>71&#xa0;Fragments of a Chronology of Chance</em>. But <em>Amour</em> examines dying, a process that is more protracted and much more upsetting to watch. There is less drama here, because the decay is predictable and wearily gradual. All the same, the climax of <em>Amour</em> is a scene that takes you by surprise and leaves you numb.</p> <p>Probably, like me, you won't know whether to be outraged or moved to tears by what you see. Haneke mistrusts the idea of catharsis, and thinks that Hollywood films have prostituted it by supplying \"false [because too quick] answers\". That's why his own plots are unresolved: <em>Hidden</em> is a whodunnit which leaves us unsure who did what to whom, and his adaptation of Kafka's <em>The Castle</em> breaks off, like the unfinished novel, in the middle of a sentence. At the end of <em>Amour,</em> the daughter of Riva and Trintignant, played by Isabelle Huppert, returns to her parents' apartment to sit and silently ponder what has happened. She represents us; perhaps, Haneke said to me, she incarnates \"our bad conscience\", since we have paid to witness the pain of fictional characters. Is she experiencing catharsis, which is a kind of purgation? It depends on what you project on to her frozen face; all I know is that my own feelings about <em>Amour</em>, when I calmed down enough to sort them out, were composed in equal parts of the terror and pity that Aristotle thought were the aftermath of tragedy.</p> <p>The man who devised these torments has a passing resemblance to El Greco's emaciated saints. Haneke dresses exclusively in black, offset by a waterfall of white hair. Although he refuses to appear in his own films \u2013 he casts his wife Susanne, an antique dealer, as an extra instead \u2013 he has said that he fancies playing a Capuchin monk, since they wear such stylish hoods. The remark catches his combination of asceticism and elegance: an American journalist once described him as \"a haute-couture Gandalf\", a wizard who is a little too fussy about his wardrobe.</p> <p>Haneke made his name by berating the complacency and amnesia of his native Austria and deriding the glossy, spendthrift consumerism of American movies: he relished the scandal at Cannes in 1998 when audiences jeered as the family in <em>The Seventh Continent</em>, having smashed their household goods, flushed wads of money down the toilet. Yet the enemy of the bourgeoisie is impeccably bourgeois, and when I arrived for our meeting at a swanky hotel near the Arc de Triomphe, I found Haneke \u2013 just off a flight from Vienna, where he lives \u2013 tucking into a luxurious lunch in the restaurant. Unhappy about being glimpsed in a situation where he wasn't in control, he scuttled upstairs to his suite and then, after an interval, made an entrance in the room set aside for our interview.</p> <p>I expected him to be detached, even haughty. Huppert, from whom Haneke extracted such a lacerating performance in <em>The Piano Teacher</em>, once called him \"a curious combination of Robert Bresson and Alfred Hitchcock\". Bresson in films like <em>Pickpocket</em> or <em>A Man Escaped</em> watches souls striving for redemption; Hitchcock in <em>Psycho</em> or <em>Vertigo</em> explores the incurably neurotic mind. Haneke mixes the contemplativeness of the one with the mischief and malice of the other. Like a god, he studies the world from a distance, unable to intervene, perhaps amused by the small, insignificant disasters he observes. Hence his fondness for placing the camera far away from its subjects: <em>Hidden</em> coolly watches as a child's small world falls apart, his cries muffled by the intervening space; and <em>Code Unknown</em> concludes by showing how life, likened by Haneke to a flea circus, indifferently unravels on a Paris boulevard.</p> <p>In person he is affable enough, but he prefers to have his contact with reality mediated by a camera. On this occasion his buffer was a translator; although Haneke's English is serviceable, he insisted on a go-between. He listened impassively as I told him how the climax of <em>Amour</em> had astounded me. He didn't require a translation, but responded by asking, in a syrupy Viennese accent, \"<em>Was ist die Frage?</em>\" (What is the question?) He then sat back to enjoy his power and my flustered impotence. I began to understand the discomfort of his actors, who are obliged to play by his rules. Huppert had a tantrum when he refused to allow her to decide on the motives of her character in his apocalyptic fable <em>The Time of the Wolf</em>. Naomi Watts, whom he directed in the American remake of <em>Funny Games</em>, broke down in tears and protested that she was not a marionette as he bossily choreographed a scene in which she bustled about the kitchen. Haneke's ideal interpreter was the late Susanne Lothar, who played Watts's role as the excruciated wife in the original Austrian version of <em>Funny Games</em>. \"She must have been masochistic,\" said Haneke approvingly, remembering that Lothar spent half an hour sobbing in her dressing room to prepare for one scene of abuse.</p> <p>Haneke has a sly, sceptical awareness of the way the cinema manipulates us, passing off propaganda or advertising as reality. He is also, however, an arch manipulator. Given notice that this was to be an inquisition not a conversation, I rephrased my compliments and asked him a question about the startling climax of <em>Amour</em>. On principle he refused to answer. \"Ah,\" he said, smirking as I tumbled into the trap, \"you are asking me to interpret, and I will not. Every meaning is fine, all interpretations are OK. I do not choose between them, because I dislike explanations. It happened so with Juliette Binoche in <em>Hidden</em>. She asked me if the woman she played was having an affair with her colleague at work. There were two scenes together with this man: I told her to play one as if they were involved, the other as if they were not. I doubt that she found this to be helpful advice.</p> <p>\"We must allow,' he said, \"for complexities and contradictions. When I am asked this kind of thing, I usually say I don't know the answer because I don't have such a good relationship with the author.\" He is of course himself the author, or auteur, since he writes all his films as well as directing them, so he was pleading lack of self-knowledge. He watched me fume for a moment, then giggled \u2013 a recurrent mannerism, perhaps an apology for his unco-operativeness, perhaps a signal of his temporary triumph.</p> <p>There is a theory behind this game of hide and seek. His films argue against \"the disempowerment of the spectator\", which is why <em>Amour</em> begins at a piano recital where we survey the audience in the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs Elys\u00e9es but don't ever see the pianist. \"I give the spectator the possibility of participating,\" Haneke said. \"The audience completes the film by thinking about it; those who watch must not be just consumers ingesting spoon-fed images.\" I was reminded of a scene in <em>Amour</em> when Trintignant spoon-feeds Riva, which might be another of Haneke's little parables: she spits the liquid back in his face, and he slaps her. \"A film cannot stop at the screen,\" said Haneke, repeating one of his mantras. \"Cinema is a dialogue.\" But it's not a dialogue in which he wants to take part: while empowering spectators, he chooses to baffle or obfuscate interviewers. Another fusillade of giggles filled the silence as I started again.</p> <p>I quoted a comment Trintignant makes in the film, when Huppert arrives to find she has been locked out of Riva's sickroom. Trintignant summarises the ghastly scene inside, and says \"None of this deserves to be shown.\" If it can't be shown to the patient's daughter, how did Haneke justify exposing it to a crowd of strangers in a cinema? \"A film can show everything,\" he said, retreating to an untested generalisation. \"It is different if someone from within the family says this. You have only not to betray your idea of what is human behaviour, and not add misery to what is actually there.\" That didn't seem to me to be an answer, since Trintignant is not talking about a bedside visit but about the propriety of making a spectacle out of decay and death. More giggles covered Haneke's reluctance to continue.</p> <p>I began to understand the reasons for his shiftiness. <em>Amour</em> extends Hitchcock's infringements of taboo in <em>Psycho</em>, which Haneke much admires. Hence Riva's ordeal in the bathroom, and another almost unwatchable moment that corresponds to the revelation of Mrs Bates rotting in the fruit cellar. (At least Riva was still able to act, which gave her a way of defending herself; by contrast Haneke cast Annie Girardot as a doddering matriarch in <em>Hidden</em> at a time when Alzheimer's disease had left her unsure of who she was.) Haneke makes us witness things from which we would usually avert our eyes. Is he doing so to cater to our prurience, as when Huppert visits the peep show in <em>The Piano Teacher</em> and sniffs a semen-caked tissue she picks from a bin while watching a gross, grunting video of copulation? Or is he punishing us by compelling us to confront mortality, as the young boy in <em>The White Ribbon</em> does when he studies a corpse?</p> <p>Haneke expects films to cause nightmares. When first taken to the cinema at the age of six to see Laurence Olivier's <em>Hamlet</em>, he began screaming in terror and had to be ushered out. After seeing Pasolini's Sadean epic <em>Sal\u00f2, or the 120&#xa0;Days of Sodom,</em> he remembers feeling nauseated for a month: that was the highest compliment he could pay the film's anthology of perverse and repellent sexual tableaux. In the past, he has had no compunction about admitting his sadistic motives. \"I've been accused of 'raping' the audience,\" he said in 2006, \"and I admit to that freely. All movies assault the viewer in one way or another.\" He added, rather snakily: \"I'm trying to rape the viewer into independence.\"</p> <p>When Haneke directed <em>Don Giovanni</em> at the Paris Op\u00e9ra in 2007, he turned Mozart's blithe seducer into a psychopathic rapist who ripped the clothes from one of his victims and violated her onstage. Haneke explained away the act metaphorically: his Don Giovanni was a pumped-up financier in an office tower, so we were watching Wall Street fuck the little people of the world. But I can't help speculating about his fascination with the ruthless libertine, especially since the cast of <em>Amour</em> includes an operatic baritone who was once a notable Don Giovanni: William Shimell plays Huppert's husband, a philandering musician. \"We met after I saw him as Don Alfonso in <em>Cos\u00ed Fan Tutte</em>,\" said Haneke. \"The part in the film is small, I thought it would be amusing. Why not? And he will sing Alfonso when I direct <em>Cos\u00ed</em> in Madrid next year.\" That too is telling, since Alfonso in Mozart's opera is a manipulator, an unmoved mover who dares two young male friends to seduce each other's fiancees. Instead of questioning Haneke about his self-identification with this elderly cynic, I asked why Riva, early in her illness, shudders with disgust at what she calls Shimell's \"British sense of humour\". It's easy to imagine her son-in-law jollying her along, boosting her morale by teasing her. Would that be so very wrong? \"I cannot say,\" replied Haneke with a disdainful sniff. \"I am not British.\" His giggle this time was entirely humourless.</p> <p>Foiled in my efforts to find out about his handling of people, I mentioned his lethal history with livestock. Trintignant traps a pigeon in <em>Amour</em>, and after appearing to smother it he chooses, in a beautiful rush of emotional release, to fondle and caress the bird. Haneke, I suspect, would have preferred to wring its neck, since like a method actor the pigeon ignored his direction. \"Ah, that was awful! There were little seeds to guide it, but it went its own way through the apartment, always differently.\" It survived, however, unlike its fellow creatures in previous Haneke films. The family dog is the first victim in <em>Funny Games</em>, several horses have their throats slit in <em>The Time of the Wolf</em>, and <em>Benny's Video</em> begins with the butchery of a squealing pig \u2013 Haneke's perfectionism required the sacrifice of three porkers. Of course he had a theory ready to account for this carnage. \"It is a hierarchy of power,\" he said. \"Men on top, then women, then children, then animals at the lowest end. They are the ones that have to bear it.\"</p> <p>But how much did these involuntary performers actually have to bear? I prodded Haneke about the aquarium in <em>The Seventh Continent</em>, overturned when the family wrecks its house as a prelude to suicide: the tropical fish flap and flounder in a sea of shattered glass. \"We did our best to protect the fish,\" he said, which is not quite the same as the \"no animals were harmed\" declaration that the RSPCA requires. \"To be honest, we did that scene many times. The whole studio was flooded, and the crew tried to grab the fish and put them in buckets of water every time I called 'cut'. By the end one or two were floating with their stomachs up. I believe they died of shock.\" This time he had the decency to not titter.</p> <p>Blocking my efforts to implicate him in his films, he resumed his theorising. \"You can use your means in a good and bad way. In German-speaking art, we had such a bad experience with the Third Reich, when stories and images were used to tell lies. After the war, literature was careful not to do the same, which is why writers began to reflect on the stories they told and to make readers part of their texts. I do the same.\" A film, according to this logic, exists only in the eye or mind of the beholder; Haneke, preserving his own moral superiority, takes no responsibility if someone sees <em>Funny Games</em> as a snuff movie or <em>The Piano Teacher</em> as pornography, and he remains blameless if we view <em>Amour</em> as a chilly experiment that vivisects its elderly actors.</p> <p>Haneke is the most incisive analyst of the kind of evasion he practises in interviews: it amounts, in his judgment, to a national psychosis. The Viennese parents in <em>Benny's Video</em> cover up the evidence of the murder their son has committed at home, and the German pastor in <em>The White Ribbon</em> indignantly refuses to recognise the horrors \u2013 including the crucifixion of a pet bird \u2013 that abound in his household. Haneke is dealing, as he has often said, with Austria's suppressed guilt, its refusal to acknowledge its shamingly recent past. Born in 1942, he grew up with this collective denial, which has become second nature to him; he has no war crimes to live down, but he must sometimes be alarmed by the darker, more transgressive impulses of his imagination. I didn't ask him about this, because he had already given me his all-purpose obstructive answer: he has only a nodding acquaintance with the author, so the dubious motives I attribute to him must be my own.</p> <p>His slipperiness left me feeling frustrated, and I heard the echo of his pesky giggle, an aural version of the Cheshire cat's smile, in the Paris street when I left. Then I remembered the impact <em>Amour</em> had on me \u2013 a tribute to the beatific grace of its actors and to their physical and moral courage, yet also to Haneke's unsparing quest for the truth about the way we live and die. A film director has the right to remain invisible; hauled out of hiding by the marketers, he is entitled to conceal or to profess ignorance of the urges that underlie his work. But it's easier to watch Haneke's films, harrowing as they are, than to meet the man who made them.</p> <p><em>Amour is released on 16 November</em></p>"
