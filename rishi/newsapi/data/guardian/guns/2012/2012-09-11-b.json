  "<p>Roy Hodgson admitted he was \"relieved\" after England salvaged a late draw against Ukraine but praised his players' perseverance and insisted the performance had been better than that which yielded a victory over these opponents at Euro 2012.</p> <p>The England manager's only real complaints centred upon the display from the referee Cuneyt Cakir, with Hodgson seeking him out at the final whistle to ascertain why Jermain Defoe's first-half goal had been disallowed. He was also unimpressed with the Turkish official's eagerness to flash yellow cards at his players, with the captain Steven Gerrard dismissed a minute from time having been penalised for fouls on Ruslan Rotan and Denys Garmash. He will miss the visit of San Marino next month, as will the full-back Glen Johnson after his second booking of the group, with three other England players also cautioned.</p> <p>\"People saw us at the European Championships in Ukraine, when we beat them [in Donetsk], but that was a better performance tonight than that which actually gave us a 1-0 victory over there,\" said Hodgson. \"You can't allow the result to cloud your judgment of the performance. We asked more questions of them tonight than we did over there, and had we lost it would have been harsh justice. As it was for them to have lost that game in Ukraine.</p> <p>\"In the end, I suppose you're always relieved when you're losing 1-0 and get a late equaliser. I'm not so certain I'm prepared to accept it wasn't a great performance. I didn't think we did that badly \u2013 we stuck to our task \u2013 even if we started very poorly but, once in our stride, we had control of the game. We went 1-0 down to a wonder strike, but I was pleased with the way we kept probing, playing our football and taking chances. We deserved our equaliser. I'm very pleased with the way we stuck at it and worked.\"</p> <p>Asked if he had been offered any explanation for Defoe's goal being ruled out, the striker having appeared to push Andrii Iarmolenko lightly in the throat only for the Ukrainian to fall clutching his face, Hodgson added: \"Not really, no. It was disallowed for a foul, apparently, but we didn't see it on the bench.</p> <p>\"I thought all the yellow cards were very harsh. I don't think there were a lot of bad fouls \u2013 or fouls, full stop \u2013 so I'm going to react and say there were far too many cards for the fouls committed, and we got too many. Steven Gerrard is extremely unlucky to be sent off. The two fouls he was adjudged to have committed were not worthy of them.\"</p> <p>Gerrard said of his dismissal: \"It's disappointing for me because it's a red card - my first one in 98 caps. But we play San Marino next. I'm sure the boys can do the job without me and then I'll be available for Poland. I'm gutted over the red, but happy with my performance.\"</p> <p>The Ukraine coach Oleg Blokhin departed encouraged by his side's point, describing it as a \"very big positive result\" and reasserting that his team are ready to challenge England, Poland and Montenegro to force passage out of the group.</p> <p>\"Before the game we'd wanted to win but, in the circumstances and after having a goal disallowed, it showed great character to get a point,\" said Frank Lampard, whose 26th international goal from the penalty spot secured the late point. \"I don't think you can pin it all on anxiety. It is a long group and this was not an easy game, so it was good to get a point.\"</p>",
  "<p>More than 200 schools across Britain are using CCTV cameras in pupils' toilets or changing rooms, according to figures obtained by anti-surveillance campaigners, who warned that the research raised serious questions about the privacy of schoolchildren.</p> <p>A total of 825 cameras were located in the toilets or changing rooms of 207 schools across England, Scotland and Wales, according to data provided by more than 2,000 schools.</p> <p>The figures are based on freedom of information requests lodged by the campaign group Big Brother Watch. Its director, Nick Pickles, said the full extent of school surveillance was far higher than the group had expected, adding: \"Schools need to come clean about why they are using these cameras and what is happening to the footage.</p> <p>\"Local authorities also need to be doing far more to rein in excessive surveillance in their areas and ensuring resources are not being diverted from more effective alternatives.\"</p> <p>The Radclyffe School in Oldham topped the list of schools with 20 cameras in toilets or changing rooms.</p> <p>Responses from 2,107 secondary schools and academies showed they used 47,806 cameras overall, including 26,887 inside school buildings.</p> <p>With 1.8m pupils being taught in these schools, there was an average of one camera for every 38 children.</p> <p>In all, 90% of schools had CCTV cameras, with an average of 24 cameras in each of the 1,537 secondary schools that responded and 30 cameras in each of the 570 academies.</p> <p>Big Brother Watch estimates the number of CCTV cameras in secondary schools and academies across England, Wales and Scotland was now 106,710.</p> <p>Pickles also claimed that the Home Office's proposals for a new regulatory structure was \"not fit for purpose\" and that a new post of surveillance camera commissioner \"will have absolutely no powers to do anything\".</p> <p>A Department for Education spokesman said: \"We have already acted to make it unlawful for schools to use biometric data like fingerprints without parents' permission.</p> <p>\"CCTV can be beneficial in some cases but this is a decision that head teachers should take. Schools using CCTV are required by law to adhere to the Data Protection Act.\"</p> <p>Sharon Holder, the GMB's national officer, said the trade union was appalled at the findings: \"Placing CCTV in school bathrooms poses a worrying development in school policy and raises a number of questions. How many parents have given headteachers permission to film their child going to the toilet or having a shower? What happens to the film afterwards? How much discussion has there been on governing bodies and to what extent have councils and councillors had any input into these developments? What problems are the schools trying to solve?</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Uncomfortable display means honeymoon is over</strong></h2> <p>England remain unbeaten, penalty shoot-outs aside, under Roy Hodgson, but the honeymoon period is clearly over. This occasion offered up many of the more sobering aspects of life in charge of the national team: a red card for the captain, Steven Gerrard, briefly announced as the sponsors' man of the match; a Jermain Defoe goal harshly disallowed; a flurry of other cautions; classy opponents cutting swathes on the counter against a jittery defence. Salvaging a draw felt like an achievement. Ukraine are ranked 39th in the world while England, albeit mystifyingly, are third, yet all Hodgson's team could offer was huff and puff until their luck turned late on. Next month's trip to Poland, another threat, feels horribly awkward.</p> <h2><strong>Lack of depth does not cover injury absentees</strong></h2> <p>The lack of strength in depth available to the manager is revealed by slogs like this. Danny Welbeck injected much needed urgency and energy into this performance, but everything up until then suggested this squad cannot cope when it has 12 absentees through injury and illness. Not many could, in fairness, but the evolutionary process of this squad will have to be gradual. England had no Evhen Konoplyanka to dribble at a sprint into enemy territory, and no Anatoliy Tymoshchuk to dominate midfield. That said a lot. It is contests like these when Hodgson needed to lean on a Wayne Rooney or Ashley Young, a John Terry or even an Ashley Cole. In their absence, this was an escape.</p> <h2><strong>Sloppy defending will be a big worry for manager</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Hodgson had sat on his bench cursing the sloppiness which seeped into the hosts' play. England surrendered the ball too easily and then seemed panicked and ill-prepared to retrieve it. The chaos of the opening few minutes set a dismal tone. There should have been familiarity in a back-line in which three players \u2013 Phil Jagielka, Joleon Lescott and Leighton Baines \u2013 had featured for Everton, yet the home side were off the pace in midfield and distracted at the back. The centre-halves looked leggy, while Lescott's poorly placed pass into a prone Andriy Yarmolenko proved key to Konoplyanka's fine long-range opening goal. The six cautions, including two for Gerrard, revealed the ill-discipline.</p> <h2><strong>Cleverley gets reality check at international level</strong></h2> <p>After all the time and space offered at the Zimbru Stadium last Friday, here was Tom Cleverley's reminder that this is international football. The Manchester United midfielder had revelled against Moldova, but Ukraine were far less accommodating. Anatoliy Tymoshchuk sat expertly in the territory Cleverely hoped to buzz, tracking his every move. It took the 23-year-old almost 10 minutes to take a meaningful touch and, when he did escape the Bayern Munich player, his attempts cannoned back first from Andriy Pyatov's legs, then from the outside of the post, or even dribbled wide. He deserves praise for endeavour, but every match is an education for Cleverley at present, particularly in an unfamiliar No10 role. This felt like a reality check.</p> <h2><strong>This qualifying group will not be an easy ride</strong></h2> <p>At first glance this section had an uninspiring look to it, with Ukraine and Poland the most glamorous visitors due at Wembley. That gave the impression that all would be a formality, attention drifting towards those fixtures that will commemorate the FA's 150th anniversary next year. Yet England must draw proper focus now. Ukraine might easily have prevailed here. Oleh Blokhin departed talking about claiming the group's automatic qualifying place, but pointing to the strengths of Poland and Montenegro to come. England, with their clutch of inexperienced performers, must take this as a warning; they may run up cricket scores against the likes of Moldova and San Marino, but this will not be a formality. <strong>Dominic Fifield<em> </em></strong></p>",
  "<p>It's all about dead animals and Nordic countries today. <strong>Lilyhammer</strong> (BBC4) first then, and here's Steven Van Zandt as an east-coast American mobster \u2013 as he should be, as he was in The Sopranos of course. So far, so not so strange. Van Zandt's character, Frank \"The Fixer\" Tagliano, has a small disagreement with the new boss. There's a shooting in a bar, Frank The Fixer's dog Lily \u2013 a little white fluffy thing, possibly a West Highland white terrier \u2013 gets tragically whacked. Frank's not happy, he testifies against the new boss, takes witness protection, gets a new identity, and a new life, in Lillehammer, Norway.</p> <p>Why Lillehammer? Because Frank thought it looked nice when he saw it on the Winter Olympics (I'm going to Lake Placid if I ever have to disappear). He even named his (now sadly deceased) dog after it. That's where the discrepancy in the spellings comes from.</p> <p>So there you have it, a New York gangster in embarrassing Scandi jumpers and moonboots, that's what Lilyhammer \u2013 a Norwegian-American collaboration \u2013 is all about.</p> <p>You can take the man out of the mob, but you can't ... etc. Frank hasn't left everything behind, soon he's up to his old tricks \u2013 dodgy deals, blackmail, extortion, violence, all carried out with a certain Italian-New Yorker charm of course. It won't be long before the whole town's going around saying <em>glem det</em> (that's Norwegian for fuhgeddaboudit, I'm actually quite good at Norwegian). And surely there will be a moose's head turning up in someone's bed. You'd have to saw the horns off first, though. Or use Mrs Moose's head. See, here is a severed animal's head, already. A sheep's in fact, and actually it's just fallen out of the shopping bag of Frank's new neighbour (they have sheep's head for tea over there). She \u2013 the neighbour not the sheep \u2013 happens to be the chief&#xa0;of police. Awkward.</p> <p>Another sheep gets whacked, this time by a wolf. So Frank whacks the wolf back (well, it's about honour really isn't it, and pride). And suddenly what was a charming sleepy winter wonderland is a hotbed of organised crime and whackage. The change coincides with Frank's arrival. His neighbour \u2013 chief of police, and chief sheep's-head-eater remember \u2013 begins to get suspicious ...</p> <p>You might expect (unfairly perhaps and based only on who's in it and where it's set) that Lilyhammer would be The-Sopranos-meets-The-Killing, a rich blend of grand American masterpiece and Nordic noir. It's not. It's more like fish-out-of-water fare. You know, a little bit Crocodile Dundee in New York, a little bit Local Hero, a little bit any number of BBC3 reality shows that send badly behaved British brats to the third world in order to buck up their ideas. Certainly a little bit odd (Sillyhammer?). But it has a certain charm to it, and Van Zandt is very watchable. I quite like it.</p> <p>One thing. After the tragic events of last summer, this slightly stereotypical portrayal of the country as an innocent place populated by charming naive sing-song people in bad knitwear looks if not wrong, then perhaps rose-tinted. Norway can be just as bad ass (in a bad way) as New York can.</p> <p>Always has been, in fact, as Neil Oliver explains, with relish, in <strong>Vikings</strong> (BBC2). \"It wasn't just what they did that made them dangerous, it was what they thought and what they believed.\"</p> <p>Now Neil's trying to get inside their heads, to think like the Vikings did (actually this first one is mainly about pre-proper Vikings, but he wants to understand what they came out of). That means taking a lot of trains around Scandinavia, looking out the window, thinking like a Viking. He meets experts, drinks coffee (so much coffee), studies rock carvings and burial mounds, eats some proto-Viking marinated pork (looks better than the sheep's head). And he sleeps in a bronze-age house.</p> <p>To be honest I got a little impatient for the main event, for the great voyages and invasions. Enough of these village people, bring on the pillage people. Love the Oseberg ship in Oslo though, which, says Neil, wasn't only used to ferry the living, but also the dead. People of course \u2013 Eric (or Erica, ladies got proper Viking burials too), or whichever bigshot it was. But they would also be sent off with everything they needed for whatever came next. Like animals. Horses were slaughtered, and dogs \u2013 hunting ones, pets, possibly West Highland white terriers \u2013 and thrown in. Imagine it, a ship piled high with corpses. And imagine the smell when they set fire to it all. Mmmmm.</p>",
  "<p>There's nothing that quite so reliably tips the British press into paroxysms of abuse and class contempt as workers having the gall to withdraw their own labour. Or even <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/11/tuc-to-consider-general-strike\" title=\"\">talking about going on strike</a>, as has been happening at the Trades Union Congress in Brighton this week.</p> <p>All the old tropes have been wheeled out in the last couple of days. These are \"mindless militants\" and \"professional whingers\", according to the Mail, the Sun and the Telegraph, determined to \"drag Britain back into the dark ages\" and holding the public \"hostage\" as they \"squeal like stuck pigs\".</p> <p>You might imagine that years of pay&#xa0;freezes and real pay cuts, attacks on pension entitlements and the loss of&#xa0;hundreds of thousands of jobs \u2013 which is what the government has imposed on the public sector \u2013 would be a reasonable basis for an industrial dispute for any workforce.</p> <p>Add to that the fact that these cuts are&#xa0;being made as part of an austerity programme opposed by most of the population and spectacularly failing to revive the economy \u2013 and industrial action is also an obvious mechanism to intensify the pressure for a change of&#xa0;economic direction.</p> <p>But as unions voted to back co-ordinated strikes and explore the practicalities of a general strike \u2013 industrial routine in other parts of Europe \u2013 the most polite criticism was they were \"out&#xa0;of touch\". For the rest, these were union \"boneheaded barons\", \"pygmies\" and \"sullen\" union \"bosses\" defending an outrageous (and fictional) public sector largesse. Nearly 200 years after <a href=\"http://www.unionhistory.info/timeline/1815_1834.php\" title=\"\">the repeal of the Combination Acts</a>,&#xa0;Britain's corporate media and political class still struggle in practice to&#xa0;accept the right to strike.</p> <p>The focus of the industrial campaign against austerity has now shifted from pensions to pay, with teachers launching a work-to-rule and the likelihood of wider action across public services in the spring. Whether that will prove to be on the scale necessary to force a government retreat is another question. But what is certain is that if workforces don't resist, cuts in pay and jobs will be&#xa0;driven through.</p> <p>Contrary to the fantasies of anti-union propagandists, the real problem for the British economy is not that unions are too strong, but that they have long been far too weak. Between 1975 and 2007, the share of wages in national income fell from 65% to 54%, while escalating inequality within that smaller share has meant stagnating real wages for low and average earners.</p> <p>A central factor in the shrinking slice of the economic cake going to workers \u2013 which helped lay the ground for the crisis of 2007-8 by fuelling personal debt \u2013 has been the weakening of trade unions, <a href=\"http://strongerunions.org/2012/04/26/2011-trade-union-membership-figures-released/\" title=\"\">whose membership halved over&#xa0;the same period</a>. In fact, the fall in union numbers since the 1970s is an almost exact mirror image of the increase in the share of income taken by the top 1%&#xa0;over the same period.</p> <p>The shadow chancellor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/11/ed-balls-heckled-tuc-pay?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Ed Balls was heckled in Brighton</a> today for backing the coalition's public sector pay&#xa0;cap as a trade-off for jobs and a token of Labour's fiscal discipline. But just as stronger unions are essential for greater equality and a better balanced economy, pay restraint now can only further deepen recession.</p> <p>If unions are successful in resisting pay and job cuts, that would boost demand and aid recovery \u2013 though it would also need the shift to a public investment and growth strategy the government remains resolutely opposed to. But public sector workers can't be expected to wait for a Labour government or for the coalition to \"understand why working people are so unhappy\", as Ed Miliband put it in Brighton.</p> <p>And however welcome the business secretary Vince Cable's conversion to an industrial strategy for the sectors of the future, the half-baked business bank George Osborne has allowed him doesn't begin to reflect the demands or scale of such an investment programme.</p> <p>Meanwhile his scrapping of health and safety regulations for small firms, as Tory leaders chafe at the bit to dump more employment and union rights, is a warning of threats to come. As the struggle over pay builds up, the government will again try to isolate public service from private sector employees, who are of course also suffering real terms pay cuts and large-scale job losses.</p> <p>Union weakness in the private sector \u2013 where only one in seven workers is now a member, compared with the majority in the public sector \u2013 is the product of decades of industrial change, fragmentation and anti-union legislation. But a string of private sector strikes this year \u2013 including on the buses, in construction and at Honda \u2013 has given a taste of how that can be turned round.</p> <p>Success has depended on bolstering industrial action with campaigns targeted at suppliers and executives, as well as working with protest groups such as UK Uncut and the Occupy movement. That is now likely to be extended to occupations and other forms of direct action, if Unite's leader Len McCluskey has his way.</p> <p>Such calls are regarded with horror by the political and media class. But the business unionism and supine \"social partnership\" they favour failed to protect jobs and living standards. Employers and politicians trampled all over it. Which is why the trade union movement now has its most radical leadership in modern times \u2013 and its most progressive general secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/05/frances-ogrady-tuc-hope-future/print\" title=\"\">Frances O'Grady</a>.</p> <p>A generation after Thatcher's assault on the trade unions, they are still treated as dangerous or embarrassing outsiders. In reality, they are not only far and away the largest voluntary organisations in the country, but now the only major area of public life where working class people are properly represented.</p> <p>Their agenda on recovery, jobs, services, inequality, privatisation, public ownership and the democratisation of economic life is closer to where public opinion is than the main parties' front benches \u2013 as Bill Clinton's former pollster Stan Greenberg underlined this week with his finding that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/10/britons-want-big-change-economy\" title=\"\">voters want \"fundamental change\" in the way the economy and country works</a>.</p> <p>And contrary to the way they are portrayed, unions are popular \u2013 as often are the strikes they call. Last November's public service walkouts were backed by <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15910621\" title=\"\">almost 80% of young people</a>. As the Tories prepare a new legal straitjacket and Labour frets about being seen as too close to the unions, their members will be at the heart of the battle over who pays the cost of this crisis.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeumasMilne\" title=\"\"><em>@SeumasMilne</em></a></p>",

And when I say a tad, that's in the same way that Death Valley is a tad warm, the Pacific Ocean a tad wet, and the Low Anthem's second album is a tad good. Wales are carved open once more, a final despairing slide from, I think, Darcy Blake can't prevent Filip Djuricic from restoring the home side's two-goal advantage.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p>8.17pm: <strong>GOAL! Scotland 0-1 Macedonia</strong> Storm clouds over Hampden. Nikolce Noveski has put the visitors ahead.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p>8.20pm: Rasmus Elm has put Sweden 1-0 ahead against Kazahkstan and at the Ernst Happel in Vienna, Marco Reus has got the opening goal for Germany.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p>8.23pm: In Group H, Poland are ahead against Moldova thanks to Jakub Blaszczykowski. And there's heartbreak for the hosts in Tbilisi \u2013&#xa0;with just four minutes remaining Roberto Soldado scored the winner for the European and World champions Spain.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p>8.26pm: Scotland are seeing plenty of the ball, but not really going anywhere against the Macedonians. It's not been a good few days for Craig Levein, although the current half-time score in Novi Sad puts Scotland's 0-0 draw with Serbia at the weekend into some context.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p>8.33pm: <strong>GOALS! GOALS! GOALS!</strong> An equaliser in Brussels \u2013&#xa0;Anderlecht's Guilaume Gillet has made it 1-1 between Belgium and Croatia. Misimovic's fourth goal of the campaign means Bosnia-Herzegovina now lead Latvia 3-1. And in friendly news, the Republic of Ireland are 3-0 up against Oman. Robbie Brady, Shane Long and Kevin Doyle have scored the goals.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p>8.37pm: So by my reckoning the only 0-0s at the moment in Europe are between France and Belarus and between Greece and Lithuania. What about England v Ukraine I hear you ask. Well, Ukraine have just taken the lead at Wembley with an absolute screamer from the very talented Yevhen Konoplyanka. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/11/world-cup-2012-england-ukraine-live\">For more, join Scott Murray</a>. I won't take offence.*</p> <p>*Please note: I will take offence.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p>8.41pm: So England losing, Scotland losing and Wales losing. Ah, scratch that. Kenny Miller has equalised for Scotland at Hampden, much to the relief of Craig Levein. A fantastic pass from Jamie Mackie puts it on a plate for the Vancouver Whitecaps man.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p>8.44pm: Someone has gone off with a knock in the Hungary v Holland game. Any Manchester United fans care to take a guess who? Those Arsenal fans over there will help you out. Robin van Persie has indeed been withdrawn by Van Gaal. Apparently just a knock, and the substitution came at half-time rather than during play, so there's cause for optimism that it's not too serious.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p>8.48pm: Half-time at Wembley and it's England 0-1 Ukraine.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p>8.49pm: Things aren't getting any better for Chris Coleman and Wales. In fact, seeing as Boris Tadic has made it 4-1 to Serbia, I'd suggest they're getting worse.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p>8.50pm: Mesut Ozil has doubled Germany's advantage in Vienna. And Jeremain Lens has put Holland 3-1 up in Budapest.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p>8.53pm: Northern Ireland continue to fly the flag for the home nations \u2013 they're still 1-0 up against Luxembourg. Lovely place Luxembourg. I recommend heading up to the northern bit to have a look at the Family of Man exhibition if you're ever in the area.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p>8.57pm: It's like 1998 all over again \u2013 Norwayt have roared back from falling a goal behind against Slovenia and have nicked three points thanks to John Arne Riise's 90th-minute penalty.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p>9pm: A quick rundown of the full-times so far in Europe:</p> <p>Bulgaria 1-0 Armenia<br>Romania 4-0 Andorra<br>Turkey 3-0 Estonia<br>Cyprus 1-0 Iceland<br>Norway 2-1 Slovenia<br>Israel 0-4 Russia<br>Bosnia-Herz 4-1 Latvia<br>Georgia 0-1 Spain</p> <p><strong>And the latest scores:</strong></p> <p>Serbia 4-1 Wales<br>Belgium 1-1 Croatia<br>Scotland 1-1 Macedonia<br>Italy 1-0 Malta<br>Sweden 1-0 Kazakhstan<br>Austria 1-2 Germany<br>Hungary 1-3 Holland<br>Switzerland 2-0 Albania<br>N Ireland 1-0 Luxembourg<br>Portugal 0-0 Azerbaijan<br>Slovakia 2-0 Liechtenstein<br>Greece 1-0 Lithuania<br>San Marino 0-4 Montenegro<br>Poland 1-0 Moldova<br>England 0-1 Ukraine<br>France 0-0 Belarus</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p>9.03pm: Early in the second half, France are close to falling behind against Belarus. Hugo Lloris makes an important block from Stanislav Dragun.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p>9.08pm: <strong>GOAL! France 1-0 Belarus</strong> And having survived that scare, Les Bleus have gone up the other end and taken the lead in Paris. Etienne Capoue with his first international goal.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p>9.09pm: In Budapest, Holland are now 4-1 up against Hungary, Klaas Jan Huntelaar with the fourth.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p>9.11pm: It's five in Novi Sad. Branislav Ivanovic gets the fifth for the home side with 10 minutes to go. Only Montenegro (playing San Marino) have scored more goals than Serbia tonight.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p>9.13pm: Macedonia are having a good little spell at Hampden. Ferhan Hasani has just wasted a very dangerous position on the break.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p>9.16pm: Scotland are reeling and Hasani has just pinged an effort from the edge of the area square on to the post with Allan McGregor beaten. Levein responds by swapping Kenny Miller for Charlie Adam, a striker for a midfielder, and the Tartan Army voice a certain amount of disapproval.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p>9.18pm: Charlie Adam goes into the book for thundering into Goran Pandev. Dangerous free-kick \u2026</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p>9.19pm: \u2026 which splats into the wall. Scotland are very much on the back foot now though.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p>9.20pm: France withdraw Olivier Giroud, but rest easy Arsenal fans \u2013&#xa0;there's no suggestion that he's crocked.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p>9.23pm: Wales are on the wrong end of a proper shoeing from Serbia \u2013 it's 6-1 now in Group A. Serbia are a stronger nation than they were given credit for after the draw against Scotland, but when you look at some of the other scores across Europe, that's nothing but embarrassing for Chris Coleman and his side.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p>9.25pm: A roar of joy from the home terraces at Hampden \u2013&#xa0;Jordan Rhodes is being brought off the bench. He's got 25 minutes or so to make an impression.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p>9.26pm: Full-time in Novi Sad: Serbia 6-1 Wales. And Scotland are inches away from going ahead against Macedonia, Rhodes nodding narrowly wide from a quick free-kick.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p>9.27pm: Over in South America Chile have taken the lead against Colombia thanks to Fiorentina's Matias Fernandez. With things pretty tight at the top of Conmebol qualifying, that's a big game. Argentina currently lead, but Chile would go top with a win tonight. Colombia are currently fifth and chasing Ecuador and Uruguay.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p>9.30pm: A few more full-times: Sweden 2-0 Kazakhstan; Austria 1-2 Germany; Hungary 1-4 Holland; Switzerland 2-0 Albania.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p>9.31pm: <strong>WHAT A SAVE!</strong> Or possibly <strong>WHAT A MISS!</strong> Pandev goes clean through for Macedonia and is denied by McGregor. The striker didn't hit his shot particularly well but the keeper (*checks big book of football cliches*) made himself big.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p>9.33pm: <strong>GOALS! France 2-1 Belarus</strong> The home side double their lead through Christophe Jallet, then find themselves pegged back almost immediately courtesy of Oleg Poutilo.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p>9.34pm: A pretty dire night (thus far) for the home nations takes another turn for the worse \u2013&#xa0;it's <strong>Northern Ireland 1-1 Luxembourg</strong> thanks to the rather wonderfully named Dan Da Mota.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p>9.36pm: That's another chance for Rhodes, and another diving effort bouncing just wide. Again it was only a half (or perhaps three-fifths) chance. Stats show Macedonia have had 12 shots to Scotland's seven.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p>9.37pm: It's not been a particularly impressive night for Italy in Modena. An injury-time own goal from Andrew Cohen has given them a two-goal buffer against Malta. And indeed that is the final score. Meantime, it's still Portugal 0-0 Azerbaijan in Braga. After all those thoughts about the need for pre-qualifying, is this the night than the minnows make their case?</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p>9.40pm: Nope. Apologies to all Azeris out there for putting the mockers on your team's efforts \u2013 Silvestre Varela has put Portugal ahead with just under half an hour to play.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p>9.41pm: Full-time in Belfast: Northern Ireland 1-1 Luxembourg. There'll be celebrating on the casements of Luxembourg City tonight.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p>9.42pm: Rib\u00e9ry. Dink. 3-1 France.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p>9.43pm: <strong>GOAL! England 1-1 Ukraine</strong> Frank Lampard spanks home a penalty with just five minutes to go.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p>9.46pm: Hearts-in-mouths at Hampden as Pandev pokes at goal. McGregor tumbles on it and Scotland, who have been pressing for the last 15 minutes, get back on the attack.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p>9.49pm: Macedonia pour forward like a tide of red custard over a jam roly poly. The break falters and it's Scotland's turn to go all Ambrosia in the other direction. Into injury time \u2026</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p>9.51pm: <strong>BOOOOOOOO!!</strong> Full-time at Hampden and the home crowd voice their disapproval. Macedonia looked a decent side, though, particularly going forward. Even so, Levein is in the firing line now.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p>9.54pm: News from Luxembourg: \"The city has just had a fireworks display to end the annual fun fair, but the news from Belfast will keep celebrations going well into the night,\" writes Duncan Roberts. \"Potato cakes, Battin beer and honey schnapps \u2026\"</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p>9.55pm: Here's James Alexander Gordon with the classified check:</p> <p><strong>Group A</strong><br>Serbia 6-1 Wales<br>Belgium 1-1 Croatia<br>Scotland 1-1 Macedonia</p> <p><strong>Group B</strong><br>Bulgaria 1-0 Armenia<br>Italy 2-0 Malta</p> <p><strong>Group C</strong><br>Sweden 2-0 Kazakhstan<br>Austria 1-2 Germany</p> <p><strong>Group D</strong><br>Romania 4-0 Andorra<br>Turkey 3-0 Estonia<br>Hungary 1-4 Holland</p> <p><strong>Group E</strong><br>Cyprus 1-0 Iceland<br>Norway 2-1 Slovenia<br>Switzerland 2-0 Albania</p> <p><strong>Group F</strong><br>Israel 0-4 Russia<br>Northern Ireland 1-1 Luxembourg<br>Portugal L-L Azerbaijan</p> <p><strong>Group G</strong><br>Bosnia-Herzegovina 4-1 Latvia<br>Slovakia 2-0 Liechtenstein<br>Greece 2-0 Lithuania</p> <p><strong>Group H<br></strong>San Marino 0-6 Montenegro<br>Poland 2-0 Moldova<br>England 1-1 Ukraine</p> <p><strong>Group I</strong><br>Georgia 0-1 Spain<br>France 3-1 Belarus</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p>10.01pm: <strong>Right, that's it from me.</strong> A pretty miserable night for England and Scotland. A very miserable night for Wales and Northern Ireland. But grand times fort Serbia and Luxembourg. Thanks for your company. Stick around on site for all the reports and reaction to tonight's games. But from me, cheerio!</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>England's World Cup qualification campaign begins here tonight.</strong> OK, technically it began <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/07/moldova-england-live-world-cup-qualifers\">last Friday night in Moldova</a>, but everyone involved knew that was just a box-ticking exercise, well as England played in dispatching the minnows. This is their first big Group H test. It is on!</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>\"It\", that said, should still be an easy enough home victory.</strong> England have played Ukraine five times previously, winning four, the most recent being that game nobody quite remembers from Euro 2012. Their one loss came in October 2009, a 1-0 defeat which meant little, for they had already qualified for the 2010 World Cup. History is on England's side.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>But Oleg Blokhin - or \u041e\u043b\u0435\u0433 \u0411\u043b\u043e\u0445\u0456\u043d if we're being pedantic - would love to gain a modicum of revenge over the teakm which knocked Ukraine out of their own tournament last summer.</strong> England are strong favourites for the victory tonight - you can win a bumper \u00a34 jackpot for an \u00a311 investment at your local turf accountancy - but Ukraine might just be in the mood to go for this. Blokhin has stated that his side \"will lose 8-0\" if they come out with the defeatist attitude (perhaps understandably) shown by the Moldovans. So hopefully, for the purposes of entertainment, they'll fly out of the blocks, and this could be quite the ding-dong affair. It's also to be hoped that Blokhin loses his rag again at some point before, during or after the match, so he comes up with another euphemism for throwing hands as good as \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/jun/20/euro-2012-oleh-blokhin-ukraine-outburst\">man conversation</a>\".</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Kick off:</strong> Eight bells.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>England:</strong> Hart, Johnson, Jagielka, Lescott, Baines, Lampard, Gerrard, Milner, Cleverley, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Defoe.<br>Subs: Ruddy, Walker, Bertrand, Cahill, Carrick, Livermore, Lallana, Sturridge, Welbeck, Sterling, Butland.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Ukraine:</strong> Pyatov, Gusev, Khacheridi, Rakitskiy, Selin, Tymoschuk, Rotan, Yarmolenko, Garmash, Konoplianka, Zozulya.<br>Subs: Koval, Shevchuk, Bezus, Mandzyuk, Nazarenko, Stepanenko, Butko, Devic, Dykan.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Cuneyt Cakir (Turkey)</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>The teams are out!</strong> England are in their trademark white with trademark red and no trademark blue. Ukraine sport their blue away shirts with blue breeks. And then the anthems. Ukraine's achieves a feat hitherto thought melodically impossible: it's even more of a dirge than God Save The Queen. Nevertheless, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1oMKa-BSvU\">I prefer it</a>. Shche ne vmerla Ukraina!</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>And we're off!</strong> England get the ball rolling, and lose it with extreme speed. A couple of challenges. Gerrard is limping around after a clatter with Zozulya, while Garmash is rolling around on the floor in agony, having been pelted with the ball. This is carnage. Onwards and upwards.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Ukraine are enjoying a lot of the ball here. Hopefully it'll stay that way for a while, if only to shut the house band up awhile. \"Nice to see where you're setting the bar for tonight by linking to something we can't see because, apparently, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/jun/20/euro-2012-oleh-blokhin-ukraine-outburst\">the copyright has expired</a>,\" writes Phil Sawyer, one ironic eyebrow going up and down so quickly it should come with a warning for epileptics. \"I'm quite tempted to have that on my gravestone: 'This content has been removed as our copyright has expired'.\" That's what I get for only reading down as far as the headline. But what a headline! Tells you all you need to know, and leaves everything else up to the imagination. It's our version of Hemingway's \"For Sale, Baby Shoes, Never Worn\". Sort of.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> Yarmolenko makes some space for himself down the right and loops a cross towards the far post. And it's towards the far post alright, because the ball hits that wooden upright after evading a confused Hart. The ball had been deflected, and bounces out for a corner which is easily cleared.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> Well this is quite a start from Ukraine. Husyev is sent towards the right-hand byline by Yarmolenko, who sends a low ball into the six-yard box. Zozulya traps with his back to goal, but can't control properly, and England hack clear. This is a very confident opening period from the visitors.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> But England respond well through Johnson, who was excellent going forward in Moldova and looks up for it tonight too. He takes on Selin, and waltzes past him into the area. He keeps drifing inside, then looks to slip in Lampard, who's bombing down the inside-right channel. But Rakitskly gets in the way to hoick the ball away from danger.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> England are living dangerously here. Konoplyanka twists down the left, finds some space, and curls a ball into the area for the onrushing Yarmolenko, who picks up the ball level with the left-hand post ten yards out. But he can't kill it dead, and it zips through to Hart, who was alert to the danger. Still, if the Ukrainian displayed a better touch there, England would probably be a goal down now.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> Defoe picks the ball up down the inside-left channel, drops a shoulder, and unleashes an absolute pearler into the bottom-left corner! It would be one of the great England goals of recent times - but in making good down the channel, he put his hand into the throat of Yarmolenko, who hits the ground. It's a bit of an over-reaction by the Ukrainian, but the referee's well within his rights to blow for a free kick, which is exactly what he does. It's probably also worth noting that the whistle went, clearly and loudly, well before Defoe hit his shot.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> Cleverley is robbed by Tymoshchuk in the middle of the park, putting England in all sorts of bother. Rotan slides the ball out left to Konoplyanka, who cuts inside and bundles the ball back for Zozulya, who looks to sidefoot into the bottom-right corner. He beats Hart, and the ball's going in, but Gerrard is back to clear superbly. England would have been livid had they conceded then, straight off the back of what was admittedly a soft free kick that cost them a goal.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> That was a fairly hectic few minutes, and the game's settled down again. England are struggling to get much in the way of possession, though, with Ukraine happily stroking it around the middle. \"Thought you'd be covering the Scotland game tonight, Scott, in honour of Olympic gold medallist and US Open champion Andy Murray and his new best buds Sirs Sean and Alex,\" writes Simon McMahon. \"Actually, probably wise to do England. Nothing is guaranteed to kill the party mood quicker than watching the Scotland football team.\" Aye, preach on brother. But regardless of what Levein's mob are up to, what's in danger of harshing Sir Sean's buzz? Marbella hasn't entered a team in the World Cup, has it?</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> This has got a very vague England-Italy-at-Euro-2012 feel all of a sudden. A lot of possession for the men in blue, England hoofing it up the channels whenever they get the chance. Nobody's really getting anywhere at present. \"Don't know when that pic of the mighty Sven was taken,\" begins John Smyth, \"but that Ericsson factory in Basingstoke has since been shuttered. As long lasting as Sven's own legacy.\" But at least twice as memorable, if your email alone is anything to go by.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>22 min:</strong> This is better from England, who are pinging it around patiently in the midfield. Eventually something nearly comes off for them, when Gerrard quickens the pace by sliding a ball straight down the middle for Defoe, who with his back to goal flicks it down the inside-right channel for Milner. The Ukraine defence panics a wee bit, but Pyatov has read the situation well and comes out to claim before Milner can get anywhere near the ball.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Ukraine were the better side during the opening 15 minutes or so, and England have done well to impose themselves on this game. Not in the dramatic up-and-at-'em sense, it's the possession thing again. But this is modern football, it says here. Anyway, seeing we're in the middle of something of a lull, here's some more on the building Sven opened in Basingstoke back in 2001. \"The building is in Chineham Business Park,\" reports Charlie Beauregard. \"It's ridiculously been built on marsh land so is sinking by about an inch a year which is not quite as quick as Sven's career is heading south.\" That's not too far from the dump, is it? Seeing were in the business of cheap metaphors, which I am.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Milner's been pretty lively, and here he comes again, blazing down the inside-right channel. He cocks his peg to shoot, but is denied at the last by a magnificent sliding tackle from Selin. From the resulting corner on the right, the ball's flown to the far post, where Jagielka is on hand to nut the ball goalwards. But his effort, while on target, is weak, and easily blocked. This has been a really good few minutes from England, who are playing some calm and considered football.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> Ukraine were attacking England at will down either flank for a while, but now the passes aren't sticking. Garmash thinks about making ground down the right, but Gerrard is on hand to break up the move. \"Are we allowed to offer our own six word short stories, a la Hemingway?\" wonders Phil Sawyer. \"'The MBM. Last hope. Hit 'send'.' There. That covers the full gamut of human emotion.\"</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> And then sleepy England nearly concede. Selin strokes a lovely curling, looping ball into the area from deep on the left. The English defence are fannying around, allowing Garmash to get a yard on them. He looks to stud the ball into the net from head height - and with no player near him, dangerous play wouldn't be a problem - but can only guide it over the crossbar. Not sure what anyone in white was doing then, or Hart in his red garb, come to think of it.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> What a miss by Basingstoke boy Tom Cleverley. Gerrard curls a ball into the area from the right. It finds Defoe level with the left-hand post, in acres of space and onside. Defoe miscues a header straight across goal to Cleverley, who only has Pyatov to beat from close range. He sidefoots straight at the keeper. You don't see this sort of nonsense at the Camrose. (Not sure that reference works particularly well outside of north Hampshire, but there you have it.)</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>36 min:</strong> A ball sent into the England area from the left is dummied by Yarmolenko for Zozulya, 12 yards out, level with the far post. He blasts a poor shot over the bar. It's becoming an increasingly difficult game to read, this one, although were this a Man Conversation I'd probably have England ahead on points.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>38 min:</strong> England again with the possession. This is the way forward, even if it's not always the way forward. \"So the ref's called 'Cuneyt'?\" notes Nick Pettigrew. \"I take it we're not touching that joke, then?\" No. No we are not. Got some Guardian values going on over here!</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>39 min: GOAL!!! England 0-1 Ukraine. </strong> What an amazing goal this is. Tymoshchuk has the ball in the middle of the English half. He takes a touch and knocks the ball wide left for Konoplyanka, who advances on the area, cuts inside, and curls a pacy effort into the top-right corner. Hart had absolutely no chance whatsoever, that was a stupendous strike.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> Cleverley romps down the right but his cross - hectically hit, the player desperate to make amends for that miss - is overhit. Oxlade-Chamberlain works well down the left to salvage a corner out of the situation, but the set piece is poor and comes to naught. \"If Sven's business park is in a marsh, then presumably it was built on the island in the marsh, or in northern parlance t'island,\" begins one-man double-act Robin Hazlehurst, a feedline which sets himself up for this: \"Which, coincidentally enough, is where Sven is now rumoured to be.\" He's here all week, ladies and gentlemen. Try the Chicken Kiev.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Ukraine are looking to see the half out, but it's getting desperate. Milner is <em>this</em> close to breaking free down the right, but he can't quite control. The ball's soon coming straight back at Ukraine, with Lampard taking his turn to skate free down the right. His low pullback finds Cleverley in the middle, eight yards out, but the young man's confidence looks a wee bit shot, and he fluffs a low-contact sidefoot miles wide left of the target.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> Cleverley's confidence shot, did I say? Not a bit of it. He ran back upfield from that missed chance looking pained, but now he's back, picking up a low ball inside from the right from Milner, dropping a shoulder in the area, and hammering a delicious rising shot past Pyatov and onto the right-hand post. The ball clanks away from danger.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>HALF TIME: England 0-1 Ukraine. </strong> And that's that for the first 45 minutes. England can consider themselves unlucky to be losing, especially as Defoe's strike was ruled out for a very soft foul. But if you raise your hands and dust someone's jowls with them, there's always a chance the ref is going to tootle his whistle. And oh me, oh my, that was some strike by Konoplyanka. It's a goal worthy of winning any match - although England will be hoping desperately that it doesn't get such reward here. Second half should be a cracker.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>HALF-TIME ADVERTISEMENT or Why The 1970s Chicken Kiev Revolution Had To Happen:</strong></p> <!-- Block 33 -->       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bchbbWsfDOA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bchbbWsfDOA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><br>And here's the fantastic Felicity Cloake explaining <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/jun/07/how-cook-perfect-chicken-kiev\">how to cook the perfect chicken \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432</a>.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>So, here we go, it's the second half!</strong> No changes. Ukraine get the ball rolling. \"Where can I buy these baby shoes you're flogging?\" asks Steve Buist. \"And how much?\"</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> A bit of a shapeless opening to the half. England knock it around a bit, but the possession's squandered when Johnson, down the right, lets the ball roll under his foot and out of play.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Defoe challenges for a high ball with Tymoshchuk. He plants his left elbow - not with any great force, it has to be said - into the Ukrainian's coupon. He's booked for his trouble, and can't really complain. Although that's exactly what he does do.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Gerrard sprays the ball wide right for Johnson, who romps towards the box. He trundles a magnificent ball along the corridor of uncertainty. It bounces straight through the six-yard box and away for a corner on the left, having taken the smallest of deflections off a Ukrainian peg. The corner is a total nonsense. \"Guardian values?\" splutters Dan Brake apropos my 38th-minute diktat re dubious ref-based wordplay. \"I remember a time when you could never print an article without a spelling mistake.\" Stay awhile. Click around. You'll find something soon enough.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> Oxlade-Chamberlain gifts the ball to Yarmolenko down the right. Yarmolenko whips a dangerous ball straight through the area, forcing Johnson to slide out for a corner to the left of goal with Zozulya lurking. The resulting corner isn't particularly good, but does allow Rotan to drag a risible shot wide left of goal.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> Defoe fights down the inside-left channel. On the edge of the area, the ball breaks to Lampard, who hits a first-time effort with the outside of his boot, looking for the top right. It's a clever off-the-cuff attempt, but always sailing wide right of goal.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> England have started pinging long balls down the channel again. It's not working for them. Gerrard is booked for planting his elbow, Defoe style, in Rotan's right cheek. That's drawn blood, and could easily have been a red card. A harsh red card, maybe, but you couldn't have run the referee out of town if he'd decided to punish the England captain further. Meanwhile here's Carey Smith with his own entry into the flash fiction canon: \"Brazil 2014. Final Tickets. Must Sell.\"</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> Selin is booked for clattering clumsily into Milner down the right. The free kick is level with the six-yard box. Gerrard swings it to the near post, where Yarmolenko heads clear with purpose. That was awful.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> What a run by Konoplyanka, who eats up half of the left wing with a burst that burns off Jagielka. He swings the ball into the centre for Zozulya, who connects at high speed but sees his effort deflected out for a corner. The set piece, sent in from the right, hits Garmesh on the shoulder and sails into Hart's hands. \"If we're discussing Hemingway-esque six-word short stories surely we can't ignore Mr. Roy's favourite new piece of fiction: 'Lampard and Gerrard can play together',\" writes Alex Hanton. \"A heartbreaking piece. Recommended by his predecessor I believe.\"</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> Tymoshchuk gifts the ball to Defoe, who scampers off down the left. The striker looks for support, but Cleverley can't keep up, and the centre is engulfed in a sea of blue.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> England are pressing forward a wee bit for the first time in a while. Defoe, Baines and Oxlade-Chamberlain all take turns to slap shots goalwards, but everything's mopped up easily enough. A lot of huff and puff with not much end product so far, but this is at least an improvement on the opening period of the half, which hasn't been great from an English perspective.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> Basingstoke's Tom Cleverley is replaced by Welbeck. \"A short story about a possible Ukranian win,\" offers Robin Hazlehurst: \"Vodka celebration. Outside now! Man conversation.\" Isn't this beat poetry?</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Ukraine seem quite happy to sit back, defend their lead, and see what happens on the break. Husyev isn't far from making something quite dangerous happen down the inside-right channel. \"I'm watching a Ukranian stream (don't ask), and the commentator keeps referring to Steven Gerrard as 'our commander',\" reports Robert Johnson. \"Do you think he's being ironic?\" Is he snorting and crying? Can you hear him slapping a thigh? That could be a clue.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Good work from Johnson down the right, and that's a corner to England. Gerrard, whose last free kick from a not totally dissimilar position was a disgrace to the eyes and all footballing sensibilities, is somehow allowed to take it. It's wasted. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEyaxm26YBI\">Wembley's getting upset!</a></p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> Johnson gets pelters for his defensive work, but he always shows up front, and here he cuts inside from the right and fizzes a marvellous low shot towards the bottom left. It's going in, until Pyatov gets a fingertip to it. Adding insult to injury, England don't even get the corner.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> Oxlade-Chamberlain is replaced by Sturridge.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> A bad minute for Rotan. First Lescott is booked for hauling down Zozulya 25 yards out. The free kick, in a fairly central position, ends up at Rotan's feet on the edge of the area. He takes a fresh air swipe. Ukraine manage to recycle the ball, but their period of pressure comes to an end when Rotan needlessly passes the ball out of play. Oh Rotan!</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> Milner's been one of England's better players tonight - admittedly not the longest of lists - and he glides a cross from the right that's just too high for the head of Defoe in the middle.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Bertrand replaces Baines. When play restarts, Milner becomes the third England player to go into the book for pressing his mitt into an opponent's mug. Rakitskly is the victim this time round.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Ukraine make their first change of the evening, swapping Selin for Shevchuk.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> Defoe has a lash from distance, but it's no good. Wembley is a very tense place now. Meanwhile here's a joke about the name of tonight's referee from Dan Brake: \"Hemingway was a bit Cuneyt. Apologies for any spelling mistakes.\" I had banned this sort of patter on Guardian style grounds regarding naughty swearies, but this counts as highfalutin literary satire rather than Football Banter, so we shouldn't get too much heat from the readers' editor.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Garmash is booked for cynically hauling back Welbeck as the striker sashays down the inside left. The set piece is 25 yards from goal. Gerrard hits a decent one this time, curled to the far post, where Jagielka challenges. Pyatov is out to punch. Corner - which is a terrible business. England have turned it up a notch here.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> Konoplyanka is a dangerous man. He tears down the left, leaving Johnson in his wake. Luckily for England, they have men back, and more of them than Ukraine have thrown forward. \"Poor, this, isn't it?\" asks Phil Sawyer. \"Sorry, I know that's two words short of a story but, like England tonight, I find myself lacking invention.\"</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> A <em>terrible</em> miss by Welbeck. Gerrard draws a few defenders with a right-to-left run along the face of the Ukraine area. He slips the ball down the wing to Sturridge, who fires a pass into the centre for Welbeck. He's got the ball at his feet, six yards out, but blasts the ball against the left-hand upright and out. He holds his head in his hands, and no wonder. On another day, that'd have pinged off the post and in, but not tonight, and it nevertheless qualifies as a dreadful miss.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> This match has turned wild. Garmash sticks a leg out in the area. Welbeck dives over it. Was there contact? England are sure there was; the ref - standing right in front of the incident - is having none of it. Ukraine sweep up the other end. Konoplyanka is sent clear down the left, but Zozulya can't guide in at speed.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>86 min: PENALTY FOR ENGLAND!</strong> Welbeck tries to set himself up in the area with a dink over Khacheridi. The ball clanks against the diving defender's arm. The referee points at the spot this time. Lampard will step up, and ...</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>87 min: GOAL!!! England 1-1 Ukraine.</strong> ... smashes an unstoppable penalty past Pyatov. Wembley erupts!</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>88 min: RED CARD FOR THE ENGLAND CAPTAIN!</strong> Gerrard is booked - and he can have no complaints for a crude lunge on Garmesh from behind. Straight through the player, that could have been a red on its own merits. But it's a second yellow, and he's walking anyway.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> Devic replaces Zozulya. Wembley is bouncing at the moment, a mix of relief and righteous annoyance.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> There will be four added minutes of this. The first sees Milner dance down the right, reach the byline, and dink one up into the middle. It's headed clear.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>90 min +1:</strong> Nazarenko replaces Devic.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>90 min +2:</strong> They've just shown the Welbeck penalty incident again. It was an outrageous dive. England can have no complaints.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>90 min +3:</strong> Johnson is booked for a late clip on Shevchuk near the left-hand corner flag.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>FULL TIME: England 1-1 Ukraine.</strong> Hart deals easily enough with the resulting free kick, and that is that. England will feel some relief here at snatching a draw, but have dropped two points at home in their first big test. That's far from ideal. More worryingly, for vast parts of the match, they were very much second best to unfancied opponents. Still, onwards and upwards. And at least England don't have Scotland's problems.</p>",
  "<p>The relationship between civil servants and outside advisers has long been a thorny one, especially when the external consultants have direct access to, and links with, ministers who are outside the control of the department.</p> <p>Senior civil servants warned the then defence secretary Liam Fox over his ties with the lobbyist Adam Werritty months before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/14/liam-fox-resignation-adam-werritty\" title=\"\">details of their working relationship surfaced and eventually cost him his job</a> in October last year, and No 10 staff often complained of the power and autonomy given to special advisers working for Tony Blair's government.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc-foi/decc-corporate-information/238-111477-correspondence-between-decc-and-miriam-mae.pdf\" title=\"\">Documents released by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc)</a> (pdf) show tensions frequently rising over ties between the minister of state, Greg Barker, and Miriam Maes, an energy consultant appointed as an adviser to the department.</p> <p>Maes, who has worked for multinationals for 30 years, was given an advisory role on a specific Decc programme and was issued with business cards and a staff pass.</p> <p>In the course of her time at the department, she attempted to secure meetings for Air Products, a company for which she acted as a consultant, and also sought direct ministerial intervention to expand her role, often leading her into direct conflict with civil servants.</p> <p>Some of them politely cautioned Maes that she needed to be careful to keep separate her Decc functions and her consulting role \u2013 she is chief executive of the energy efficiency adviser Foresee, whose clients include BAA, Morgan Stanley and British Gas.</p> <p>She was also pressed to give civil servants the chance to sit in on her meetings.</p> <p>In an email, the national climate change director Colin Church wrote: \"Your offer to provide a weekly review and look forward of meetings and activities you are engaged in is very welcome \u2013 it is vital that the team get the option to sit in on these meetings, especially in relation to MoD work, and to help make clear the separation of your Foresee/Matrix position and your contract with Decc.</p> <p>\"There is one other issue I wanted to mention. I know the team are keen to share the full range of our work with you to maximise their use of your experience. However, we are of course speaking to a range of outside contacts, where the parties concerned may have concerns on the level of disclosure of commercially sensitive material.\"</p> <p>The weekly updates were initially welcomed as \"very useful\" by civil servants, but stopped within months. Maes also continued to have direct contact with Barker without civil servants being present or copied in to emails.</p> <p>Barker asked Maes to lead or advise on issues outside the remit of her Decc contract, which then led to debates with civil servants over payment. \"[Redacted] is also aware and has agreed to help clarify for all when Ministerial requests are within contract or not,\" one email sent in November 2010 noted.</p> <p>By March 2011, officials objected to conflicting advice from Maes reaching ministers without their knowledge and attempted to get more information on her activities and advice: \"I would ask if you could restart your short weekly emails of what you have been doing,\" said the email, from an anonymous official. \"Secondly, it would be very useful to be copied your advice to Greg in same we share our advice with you.</p> <p>\"I trust you would agree that it is not efficient, effective or indeed fair, for me or my team to be in meetings where we are basing our support to GB [Greg Barker] or SoS [secretary of state] on one briefing, if they are working to another briefing we have not seen before \u2026 Besides providing clarity we do need to watch the 'audit trail' for decisions as it will be me and my management answering challenging select committee questions!\"</p> <p>Maes was evidently not happy with the requests made in the civil servant's email and quickly brought the matter directly to Barker's attention, saying that the communications were \"really getting to me\" and that sending officials weekly updates was \"out of the question, in particular as I am doing a lot of confidential work for you and not getting paid any more\".</p> <p>She continued setting out details of extension payments to her contract that she was attempting to secure \u2013 noting: \"The next extension can only be \u00a310k\" \u2013 and concluded by saying: \"I really appreciate your personal support in trying to solve this issue.\"</p> <p>Barker replied three and a half hours later: \"I am sorry about the continuing aggro with your invoice, I really am going to bang the desk about this today.\"</p> <p>Barker continued to be asked to involve himself in the contractual dispute between Maes and officials. \"Please find below the email regarding the outstanding invoices to Decc. Thank you so much in advance for dealing with this painful situation,\" Maes wrote. \"I greatly appreciate your personal support in this.\"</p> <p>A separate email from Maes drafted a reply for Barker to send to civil servants telling them Maes should head a particular Decc programme and asked: \"Could you please also figure out a way in which I could be paid for this work?\" Soon afterwards, Barker sent an email based on Maes's draft to civil servants.</p> <p>Maes eventually won a contractual extension for the additional funds, but then needed to secure a new role after the end of her time at the department. She drafted a note to Barker asking: \"Can you get a new contract under Whitehall District Scheme for example whilst the Chairman Energy Efficiency role is being sorted or just sort the Chairman role now?\"</p> <p>The note to Barker continued: \"You are reviewing the option of Chairman of the new Office for Energy Efficiency with Phil and Moira. You are also possibly discussing for me to temporarily take on the role of leading this unit.\"</p> <p>Soon after, she was appointed as an external adviser to Decc's energy efficiency deployment office.</p> <p>On Tuesday night, Maes defended her Decc role and said she took on unpaid work even though her consultancy Foresee employs just her and her personal assistant.</p> <p>\"I declared the clients I had in Foresee, of which Air Products was one. Air Products was also mentioned on my CV and Decc was aware of my commercial relationships in my consultancy as part of the recruitment process and beyond,\" she said. \"Decc contracted with Foresee as an adviser to the department because of my expert knowledge on energy efficiency, decentralised energy and transmission and distribution . In addition, I provided views to Decc and the minister on a pro bono basis.\"</p>",
  "<p>Your editorial (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/06/arts-reality-check?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">7 September</a>) on the appointment of Peter Bazalgette as the <a href=\"http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Arts Council</a> chair says that while philanthropy, made up of corporate and individual giving, does do a lot of good, it is less good at supporting new or experimental work. Though I could give you many examples of exemplary private giving in these areas, what is missing from your analysis is the vital role of trusts and foundations. The <a href=\"http://artsandbusiness.org.uk/News/2012/Feb/private-investment-in-culture-figures-2010-11.aspx\" title=\"\">Arts &amp; Business Annual Private Investment in Culture survey</a> this year saw giving by trusts and foundations leap 10% to \u00a3170m, which, for the second year running, is higher than business support. Much of this funding is for new and experimental work, much of it outside London. These trusts and foundations, though originating from the private wealth of individuals, have moved away from \"status-seeking conspicuous consumption\", as you put it, to become highly professional funders \u2013 for example, the Paul Hamlyn, Esm\u00e9e Fairbairn, Jerwood, DeHaan and Sainsbury foundations.</p> <p>These trusts and foundations are also leaders in funding arts in areas of social exclusion.

  "<p>It is worth adding to the Skidelskys' article (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/07/west-work-ethic-social-ideal?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Why we need weekends</a>, 8 September) that though, in the early 19th century, \"Sundays alone were left free for chapel or gin\", there was a serious attempt by the Church of England and various Tory MPs to introduce legislation in the 1830s to deal with what the bishop of London called \"the present neglect of the Lord's Day\": more chapel, therefore, and less gin. The attempt narrowly failed and one of its biggest opponents was the young Charles Dickens, who, fresh from his Pickwickian triumph, produced a pamphlet called <a href=\"http://www.pagebypagebooks.com/Charles_Dickens/Sunday_Under_Three_Heads/\" title=\"\">Sunday Under Three Heads</a>. This aspect of Dickens' writing ought to be given more attention, especially in his bicentenary year.</p> <p>The issues which he dealt with in his journalism throughout his life often reappear in his novels. For example, in 1850 he wrote two pieces about the importance of <a href=\"http://www.djo.org.uk/indexes/articles/the-amusements-of-the-people.html\" title=\"\">The Amusements of the People</a> and concluded with the hope that there is \"some congeniality between what will excite Mr Whelks (his imaginary character who has just been to the theatre), and what will arouse a duchess\" who may recently have been to an Italian opera \u2013 neatly uniting \"the two nations\".</p> <p>In 1855 Dickens opposed another piece of class-biased legislation attempting to stop Sunday trading. In <a href=\"http://www.djo.org.uk/indexes/articles/the-great-baby.html\" title=\"\">The Great Baby</a> (1855) he opposed the moralising teetotalism of his former illustrator, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Cruikshank\" title=\"\">George Cruikshank</a>, believing that the real need was to look closely at the causes of drunkenness and disorder. The picture of a \"gloomy, close, and stale\" London Sunday in <a href=\"http://www.online-literature.com/dickens/little_dorrit/4/\" title=\"\">chapter 3 of Little Dorrit</a>, written at the same time, gives a fictional illustration of the joylessness of the temperance vision. He was opposed to a parliament of the wealthy dictating how the poorer classes should behave on Sundays. I suspect he would have agreed that we do need weekends, as \"Lighten it!\" was his constant exhortation in the 1850s to those working on his periodical <a href=\"http://www.djo.org.uk/household-words.html\" title=\"\">Household Words</a>.<br><strong>John Chambers</strong><br><em>Bath </em></p>",
  "<p>Can I have my brain back now? I enjoyed the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012\" title=\"\">Olympics</a>, and my impression is that most Britons did so too. Holidaying at home, I noticed people in pubs and shops delighting in unusual celebrities and unusual challenges, especially from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/paralympics-2012\" title=\"\">Paralympians</a>. With Bradley Wiggins' success in the Tour de France and Andy Murray's in New York, it made for a satisfying summer of sport.</p> <p>Yet I saw nothing to justify the hysteria, the sobbing with joy and weeping with ecstasy, of the London media and politicians. The grasping for national pride and pseudo-psychological significance exaggerated the event and cheapened the athletes' achievement. As for the prime minister asking the Games minister, Jeremy Hunt, to run the NHS \"because of the Olympics\", it was worthy of Caligula.</p> <p>Mayor Boris Johnson's hilarious speech to the London crowd on Monday shamelessly upstaged David Cameron's. The latter had modestly suggested the London Games would be remembered \"for hundreds of years\" and showed Britain could \"do great things \u2026 and take on the world and, yes, we can win\". Johnson went berserk. He bellowed of a nation in paroxysms of joy, of orgasms on tube trains and songs on sofas, or vice versa. Both men shamelessly hijacked the games, acclaiming a nation on a shining path to collective recovery. They were like Soviet leaders lauding the virtues of higher tractor production.</p> <p>Hijacking any cultural enterprise to a political goal is dangerous. Johnson should know that those who lived by the Roman mob died by it. He exulted in his uproarious jokes and ridiculed \"the doubters and gloomsters\", but he never mentioned his own status as gloomster-in-chief. Only six weeks ago, he was telling Londoners on the tube to get out of town since hell was about to break loose. They did. Johnson must have cost the London economy millions.</p> <p>No one I know seriously doubted London could stage a successful Olympics, given enough money. The doubts were over value for money, given that it would be immeasurable. Britain does big events well, though in this case it needed American subcontractors at almost every venue. While Lord Coe showed himself adept at throwing public money at every problem, credit for the venues and the shows should go to Sir John Armitt's delivery authority and Danny Boyle's entertainers. But it was the athletes who triumphed, overwhelming the nasty taste of the International Olympic Committee, its ZiL lanes and fat cats.</p> <p>The real Olympic doubters were the organisers themselves. Those who argued for a low-cost, more open games within the original budget were ignored. The organisers simply panicked. They tripled the money needed and capitulated to the IOC's demand for unique stadiums, and to the security lobby's outrageous demands for cash. The Stratford site is now being shut down, and those whose taxes paid for it prevented from seeing it before dismantling.</p> <p>A tenth of the budget, almost \u00a31bn, went on security \u2013 not to mention missiles, submarines, frigates and jets. Despite weekly leaks from the securocrats of \"terrorist menace to Games\", there was no hint of one. Cameron is now forced to claim that every item of this paranoid spending was value for money because \"it worked\". On that basis he should go everywhere in a tank, with machine-gun nests on every street corner. I am sure that would \"work\".</p> <p>The Olympics were an enjoyable sporting event, well-delivered by those paid (handsomely) to deliver them. As the left has plausibly pointed out, this proves only that unrestricted public spending can work wonders. As during the Falklands, Iraq and Afghan wars, you simply tell the Treasury to shut up. Any amount of expenditure on the Olympics was permissible, even an extra \u00a340m on the opening ceremony. There was no stringency or budgetary responsibility. It just went wild.</p> <p>I love sport, so long as it is not made a sub-set of pop psychology. I can feel national pride, with due agony when England plays Wales. I was overjoyed to awaken on Tuesday to news of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/11/andy-murray-us-open-novak-djokovic\" title=\"\">Andy Murray's victory in New York</a>, as by Lewis Hamilton's in the Italian Grand Prix. But what moved me was the spectacle of talent and hard work rewarded. It was not Johnson's chauvinist glee at the humiliation of France, Germany and Australia, which bore uncomfortable echoes of Orwell's sport as war without guns, \"bound up with hatred, jealousy, boastfulness and sadistic pleasure\". It is too close to totalitarianism.</p> <p>If overlain with enough bombast, any public spending that yields no benefit beyond feel-good can simply be asserted as \"worth it\". Any questioning of its expense can be declared unpatriotic. The same is true of spending on defence. No sum is considered too great and no return too abstract. Like security, glory admits no audit.</p> <p>Those not glory-besotted are thus entitled to ask why, if we can spend like this for the Olympics, we cannot do so for other purposes. Money was certainly pumped into the economy. The coalition government now obviously craves a post-Olympics economic surge. So if it can blow \u00a39.3bn on sport, no questions asked, why not make similar injections into general consumption?</p> <p>Or why not celebrate youth in other ways? Why not shower money on intellectually rather than physically gifted young people, give them facilities, invite others from abroad and set them challenges? We could call it a university. How about \u00a39bn extra on that? Or will the coalition's doubters and gloomsters say we can't afford it?</p>",
  "<p>Justine Greening, the new international development secretary, has reassured Britain's main aid charities that she remains committed to meeting a UN target on overseas aid spending.</p> <p>As George Osborne told MPs that the government would abide by its commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income on aid by 2013, Greening told Save the Children and other charities that this is the \"right thing to do\".</p> <p>There has been speculation that Greening, who was furious when Cameron demoted her from the Department for Transport to prepare for a possible U-turn over a third runway at Heathrow, would weaken Britain's commitment to the UN target. Some aid groups had warned that the chancellor could abandon the 0.7% target in his autumn statement as he searches for new savings.</p> <p>But Greening said at her first meeting with aid charities: \"Delivering on our promise of 0.7% is the right thing to do, whether it's helping countries cope with natural disasters and famines, or working with some of the British charities who are world leaders in international development.\"</p> <p>Greening said she would continue the work of her predecessor, Andrew Mitchell, in ensuring value for money in Britain's aid budgets, one of the few to be ringfenced by the Tories. She said: \"I will critically assess our budget on behalf of the British taxpayer to make sure that, pound for pound, it goes exactly where it's intended and where it can make the biggest difference.\"</p> <p>She added: \"A strong focus on international development is also the smart thing for Britain to do. You only have to look at the business generated by China and India to see the potential they provide for UK companies as their export markets continue to develop. My work at international development will sit alongside the [Foreign Office's] work led by William Hague to build strong relationships around the world, as the developing countries of today become our trading partners of tomorrow.\"</p> <p>Osborne confirmed that the government would meet the 0.7% target when he was asked by the former Labour minister Tom Clarke when a bill to implement the pledge would be introduced. Osborne said: \"The short answer is yes, we are. It is not about legislation; it is about delivering the money.\"</p> <p>As Labour MPs interrupted him, Osborne said: \"Labour members say 'Ah'. But we can legislate as much as we like. The question is whether we are prepared to take the difficult decisions to deliver the money. They say they do not trust us, but this is the government who will deliver the 0.7% aid commitment that all parties signed up to.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong>The Treasury is preparing to abandon its chief fiscal target for this parliament in the autumn statement on 5 December if its retention would mean imposing further swingeing spending cuts before the next election.</p> <p>The fiscal mandate requires the government to ensure that public sector net debt as a proportion of national income is falling between 2014-15 and 2015-16. Abandoning the target would be a risky political decision.</p> <p>Current high borrowing figures and lower tax receipts have rapidly reduced ministers' chances of reaching the target, though the Treasury insisted on Tuesday it was premature to come to a final conclusion before further sets of borrowing figures are published.</p> <p>Well before the autumn statement, Osborne and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) will hold discussions with the Treasury on the implications of its spending plans for meeting the debt GDP target. In March, the OBR predicted the government would narrowly meet its debt target, but since then borrowing figures have been substantially higher than forecast. City experts are predicting the Treasury will borrow \u00a348bn more than forecast in 2015-16. The government's debt ratio would rise that year to 90% from 85.2% the previous year.</p> <p>There have been reports that the chancellor, George Osborne, who announced the date for the autumn statement on Tuesday, has even been considering a small fiscal stimulus to boost demand, a view that is gaining growing support in business circles and among Tory policymakers.</p> <p>Few believe a modest stimulus would lead to a surge in UK borrowing costs or a serious attack by credit rating agencies.</p> <p>At the weekend, the business secretary, Vince Cable, hinted at the scale of government discussions, saying: \"The problem of growth is that we have a very serious shortage of demand. It's nothing to do with those supply side measures basically. It's a demand issue.\"</p> <p>Launching his industrial strategy on Tuesday, he said there was no conflict between supply and demand measures.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat deputy leader Simon Hughes went further at the weekend, saying: \"Clearly plan A hasn't been enough, but plan A was the right place to start because, unless we restored the sense that we were in control of our own economy at home and retained international credibility in Britain, nothing else would be possible. Now what hasn't happened is that growth hasn't come nearly as quickly as people thought and hoped. The levers that have been pulled haven't adequately worked.\"</p> <p>The issue is likely to be raised at the Liberal Democrat conference in a week's time.</p> <p>The threat to the debt GDP target came into focus in August when it was reported that public sector net borrowing totalled \u00a30.6bn in July, compared with a surplus of \u00a32.8bn last year. This was way below the \u00a32.5bn surplus expected by analysts.</p> <p>In the Commons on Tuesday Osborne refused to accept the August borrowing figures inevitably signalled a new structural problem. He conceded that \"borrowing in the short term has been higher this year than in the first four months of last year\", but he pointed to \"particular one-off factors, such as the shutdown of the Elgin oilfield. That is why the increase in borrowing comes from weaker corporation tax receipts.\" He added: \"VAT, national insurance and income tax receipts have broadly held up, despite the weaker economic conditions here and around the world.\"</p> <p>Treasury sources concede that ministers may have to adjust their plans if there has been a permanent fall in tax receipts. The Treasury said on Tuesday that the government was committed to its fiscal plan.</p> <p>The government has an additional target of ensuring policy is consistent with achieving at least a cyclically adjusted current budget balance within five years, but this is a less politically challenging target as it only has to be met in five years' time from the point at which the latest OBR forecast is made.</p> <p>Labour sources claimed the government's recent set of supply-side announcements would do little to address the short-term issues of lack of confidence.</p> <p>Osborne appeared to cut off one route to make short-term spending cuts saying the government remained committed to its aid target, telling MPs: \"This is the government who will deliver the 0.7% aid commitment that all parties signed up to.\"</p> <p>There had been speculation that the arrival of Justine Greening as international development secretary presaged a weakening of the commitment.</p>",
  "<p>Setting out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/11/vince-cable-laissez-faire-work\" title=\"\">his new policy on developing Britain's industries</a>, Vince Cable began with a reference to the Olympic summer. And rightly so, because the story of how British sport staged a startling turnaround in just 16 years is not only fascinating in its own right, but instructive in thinking about how we rebuild a shattered economy.</p> <p>The story can be briskly told: after Britain scored a solitary gold at Atlanta in 1996, lottery money was pumped into elite sports, with special regard for how many medals could be won per pound spent. Around the same time, the Manchester velodrome and other world-class facilities sprang up and top-drawer coaches, such as cycling's Dave Brailsford, were brought on board. Physios and psychologists were laid on for the athletes; engineers and technologists streamlined the kit. The results we saw at the London Olympics: the best British performance in any Games for over a century. And, without wishing to take anything away from Mo Farah and other sporting heroes, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/20/osborne-pay-heed-olympics-triumph\" title=\"\">such across-the-board outperformance</a> was largely thanks to record investment, gimlet-eyed targeting and dogged planning.</p> <p>Compare this tale of triumph to the sorry story of Britain's industrial base. Since the 80s, even to mention the need for an industrial strategy was to risk dismissal from mainstream politicians as picking winners. Labour was as guilty of this as any son-of-Thatcher. It was pious nonsense, of course: politicians would love to pick winners; it's being lumbered with losers they can't stand. But the result has been to leave Britain as the only major economy without an industrial strategy, the only G8 country without a national investment strategy, and pretty much the only advanced country without a serious regional development policy. Britain is virtually the only big country in the world that thinks it can grow industry without having an actual strategy to do it. And the results of that neglect have been brought home in the wake of the banking crash, which has shown up the lopsidedness of Britain's boom-time economy.</p> <p>It's against that background that Mr Cable's intervention should be understood. The Lib Dem is by instinct a deregulator (which isn't necessarily the same thing as trashing employment rights, whatever the Conservative right may like to think); indeed, just a few years ago he called for the abolition of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2002/sep/25/libdems2002.liberaldemocrats\" title=\"\">the same Whitehall department</a> he now heads. Yet on Tuesday he called for a government strategy to develop new and existing industrial strengths.</p> <p>This was a bold move which deserves wider encouragement. A full-fledged Wiggo plan it is not: the government has no idea how much any of its schemes will cost, nor where the money will come from. Apart from aviation, cars and pharmaceuticals, there are frustratingly few specifics about which sectors should benefit. Most crucially, Mr Cable did not spell out what an industrial policy is for. To provide good new jobs? His speech did not so much as mention the words, yet jobs should surely be front and centre in any such plan. To diversify sources of tax revenue? Surely vital. To provide for future social needs? That would imply, say, improving care for the elderly \u2013 just as Japan plans to in its latest industrial strategy \u2013 but such activities do not fall into the category of \"knowledge-intensive services\".</p> <p>Such questions can't be addressed in a single day. Labour's <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/chuka-umunna-and-rachel-reeves-only-a-crossparty-plan-will-rebuild-britains-economy-8104229.html\" title=\"\">Chuka Umunna</a>, who has made thoughtful contributions to this debate, is also a long way from setting much down in policy. But the risk is that other countries are much further down this road. Tokyo has not only identified key sectors; it has thought about how to direct monetary policy to help them. The US has a full-blown venture capital sector \u2013 and state finances on hand too. Joining up Britain's future needs and opportunities with its present capabilities is a job that will probably pay little reward to the politicians who begin it. For that alone, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/11/vince-cable-industrial-policy\" title=\"\">Mr Cable deserves commendation</a>. But he and the rest of our political class also need to be pushed much further and much harder.</p>",
  "<p>The Law Commission today launched an overdue <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/11/divorce-law-incomplete-uninformative?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">consultation aimed at rectifying anachronisms at the heart of the family courts&#xa0;system</a>. For, despite a succession of landmark cases and the advent of pre-nuptial agreements, divorce laws have remained set in aspic since the paternalistic days of 1969, when the divorce rate after 15 years was one in five, with legislation calibrated to protect women as the dependents they so often were.</p> <p>Forty years on, one in three unions have failed by their 15th year, with about 40% of first marriages ending in divorce and 70% of second. Love and marriage no longer go together like the proverbial horse and carriage and, where they do, the situation is less till death us do part, more \"Let's regroup on this in a decade\". As one aspiring divorcee recently told me: \"Ours is an Ikea marriage: I don't see it outlasting the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium-density_fibreboard\" title=\"\">MDF</a>.\" What has changed is that this is furniture her job paid for; divorce a situation she expects to take in her financial stride.</p> <p>The consultation sets out possible ways forward, not least facilitating \"a transition to\" or \"incentives for independence\" rather than \"encouraging dependency\" on former spouses. If this does not yet represent <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Millett\" title=\"\">Kate Millett</a>'s utopian vision in which: \"Men and women were declared equal one morning and everybody could divorce each other by postcard\", then there is at least some recognition of the sea change British society has undergone in the last four decades. Instead of a premise that women represent a population of housebound hausfraus, implicit would be the not so very radical notion that both parties are assumed to have the capacity for independence.</p> <p>One can immediately imagine circumstances in which there might be exemptions: not least where many elderly women remain without pensions. There may be concern regarding the imposition of legislation that is based on those with more money than sense on those with just as little money as wit. However, such modernisations would recognise a zeitgeist shift in which marriage, motherhood and men and women themselves have evolved \u2013 and for the better.</p> <p>Our cultural expectation is that of gender equality, whether in our capacity to work, parent, or stand on our own two feet. Why should this be reflected in all but divorce law? If one is a fundamentalist or a footballer, one will still be able to pre-nup oneself a more regressive paradigm. However, women not seeking such unions can only benefit from being perceived as adults rather than male responsibilities.</p> <p>The message to the young is that marriage is not a meal ticket. But then with the exception of a token gaggle of Wag wannabes, few young women will harbour such delusions. Instead, with their superior grades and ever more sparkling prospects, they stand every chance of doing better than \u2013 and not being fleeced by \u2013 the chaps they wed.</p> <p>Child-rearing, of course, complicates matters, as any reforms would be obliged to take into account. Nothing sabotages a woman's short- and long-term earning potential like motherhood, while fathers tend to remain unaffected. However, it is possible that parenting will become necessarily more shared as women refuse to compromise their post-divorce prospects, or that new financial models may be developed to address this inequity.</p> <p>For such changes will be as much about how we see marriage as how we view divorce. Reform poses the question: what does it mean to be a wife or husband? The answer: not a helpmeet nor handmaiden, not a pater familias nor patriarch, but individuals who are partners for so long as that partnership is agreed, individuals again when it isn't.</p> <p>With divorce less momentous, so marriage will be less fetishised: one less feared, the other less exalted. Matrimony will be, as it is, simply another means of organising a relationship: an option, rather than some epically life-changing be all or end all. Whether they pre-nup or no, couples will be more likely to address why they are doing what they are doing and what their expectations are, rather than burying their heads in so much tulle.</p>",

  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Central London based, salary in the region of \u00a3300,000 and for a fixed eight-year term, the prestigious role needs a \"strong communicator\", with \"good interpersonal skills\" and \"a person of undisputed integrity and standing\".</p> <p>Such characteristics are often cited by many employers when seeking out candidates for key positions, but this is no ordinary role. It is by appointment by the Queen, requires close work with the chancellor of the day \u2013 and will bestow the title of \"governor\" on the successful candidate.</p> <p>In an unprecedented move, the Economist will on Friday carry a five paragraph advert to find the replacement for Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, who is unable to apply after his term expires in June next year.</p> <p>Released on Tuesday, the first advert for the increasingly powerful role calls for an \"advanced understanding of financial markets and good economic knowledge\" and a need to inspire \"confidence and credibility both within the bank and throughout the financial markets\".</p> <p>International travel is required \u2013 often to the sleepy Swiss city of Basel, the home of international banking regulation \u2013 as is a desire to chair three bodies that set monetary policy, check the health of the financial system and oversee bank regulation.</p> <p>Experience at other central banks \u2013 or indeed within the Bank of England \u2013 will be helpful.

  "<p>Barcelona was a sea of red and yellow Catalan flags as more than 1.5 million people brought the city to a standstill on Tuesday at a mass rally called to demand independence for the Spanish region.</p> <p>The planned route was already filled with demonstrators before the march began, in what marked a watershed for the hitherto marginal independence movement.</p> <p>At least one train and more than 1,000 coaches had been chartered to bring supporters to the march.</p> <p>Long-standing resentment about what Catalans see as their unfairly high contribution to central government has been inflamed by Spain's economic woes. Polls published on Tuesday show support for independence running at 46.4%, twice as high as in 2008, when the financial crisis began.</p> <p>The upsurge in support for secession has caught Catalonia's nationalist CiU government on the hop. CiU, which has governed Catalonia for 25 of the 33 years since democracy was restored, has never aspired to independence, preferring to wring more autonomy out of minority governments in Madrid.</p> <p>Artur Mas, the Catalan president, initially said he had no intention of joining the march but later said he would attend in a personal capacity. Carme Forcadell, a spokeswoman for the group behind the march, said: \"Anyone who attends should understand that they will be considered pro-independence.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396000137\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/9/11/1347359713425/Catalonia-map-001.png\" alt=\"Catalonia map\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catalan calls for independence have increased sharply since the financial crisis exploded in 2008, hitting Spain particularly hard</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Speaking on television on the eve of the rally, Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, dismissed the march, saying: \"This isn't a moment for big gestures like this. What we need to do is create jobs.\"</p> <p>Carles Brugueras, a documentary film-maker said he was not a nationalist but favoured independence from a strictly economic perspective. \"For a long time, Catalonia has been generating a lot of resources for Spain but the fiscal balance has been very unfair,\" he said.</p> <p>Laura Nu\u00f1ez, a law student and also a new convert to independence, said she believed it would boost the Catalan economy. \"We're economically the most powerful part of Spain, because of industry and tourism, and we contribute more than other Spanish regions,\" she said. \"We shouldn't be subject to this internal discrimination.\"</p> <p>The slogan for the march was \"Catalonia: a new European state\". But a European Union spokesman in Brussels pointed out that, were Catalonia to secede from Spain, it would have to leave the EU and could rejoin only if it met the economic criteria and if other member states voted unanimously in favour of its membership.</p> <p>Whether Catalonia would be viable as an independent state is an open question. Much of Catalonia's wealth comes from tourism, but there are major industries in the region, as well as a significant multinational presence. Whether these firms would want to remain in a small state that was not part of Spain is unclear.</p> <p>If the region continues to pursue independence, boycotts could follow, analysts warn. There was a damaging cava boycott in 2005, when Catalonia refused to back Madrid's bid for the 2012 Olympics.</p> <p>The economist Xavier Cuadras warned: \"A large-scale boycott could cause a 40% drop in exports of consumer goods to Spain, and a sustained boycott could cost Catalonia 4% of its GDP.\" Spain accounts for 54% of the region's exports.</p> <p>In sport, Catalans make much of the fact that half the victorious Spanish football team are Catalans. But it is doubtful whether many of those players would play for a small country that was unlikely to win anything at an international level. The same goes for the mighty Barcelona football club: if Catalonia were independent, it would be reduced to playing in a semi-professional league.</p> <p>And not all Catalans are pro-independence. Some 40% of Catalans are Spanish immigrants \u2013 or the children of those immigrants \u2013 who fled poverty in rural Spain after the civil war and retain strong family and emotional ties with Spain. Then there are a further 1 million people (14% of the population) who are from other EU states, Latin America, Morocco, Pakistan and China. Very few of these, were they given the chance to vote, would back independence.</p> <p>There is considerable antipathy in Spain towards the Catalans, who are widely perceived as rich, spoilt, constantly complaining and forever playing the victim. Catalans are, understandably, hurt by this. \"The rise in the pro-independence movement is directly related to the Spanish state's inability to include Catalonia,\" said Miquel Berga, professor of English literature at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra. \"It seems to me that only a profound change in constitutional arrangements can address the prevailing sense of dissatisfaction.\"</p> <p>Joan Fumaz, a chef, said: \"If we were independent, we wouldn't have to go on justifying ourselves. I'm Catalan. It would be nice not to have to explain that to people all the time.\"</p>",

But the Guardian has gained exclusive access to the former MP's diaries for September 2012, as yet unwritten but provisionally entitled But That's Enough About You. Now read on:</p> <p><strong>Belgravia (Edwina's London pied-\u00e0-terre), Tuesday 4 September</strong>: The papers all say David Cameron is planning a reshuffle, so I have stayed close to the phone all day. How well I remember the advice I gave him when he was a clueless young special adviser at the Treasury, helping John Major's useless government ruin the economy. But look at him now, despite not being physically very attractive (that face, doesn't he know any plastic surgeons?). Though Dave never made a pass at me (unlike that Boris, cheeky boy!) I'm pretty sure he's still grateful and may want me to help refresh his tired team. This wet coalition needs more super 60s ministers with experience. A certain Baroness Currie would make a lot better job at justice than Fatso Clarke.</p> <p><strong>Derbyshire (Edwina's country hideaway), Wednesday 5 September:</strong> I can't believe it. Cameron has overlooked me again; he's obviously a misogynist or gay. I do feel for poor Sayeeda Warsi, though she could lose a few pounds. But none of the women he's promoted are attractive. As for sending that Murdoch creep, Jeremy Hunt, to my old department, what can No 10 have been thinking? Jezzer's just the sort of twit to drop cringe-making and insensitive gaffes which upset voters and no one remembers \u2013 unlike my tough talk on salmonella in '88. I was right about eggs, as I explained to Margaret at the time. But she wouldn't listen. It was the beginning of the end.</p> <p><strong>Hull (where Edwina is doing a quiz show on Radio Humber), Thursday 6 September: </strong>Must check that No 10 has my new mobile number in case Cameron still has a surprise up his sleeve. Unfortunately the Paralympics and some ghastly murder in France is taking the spotlight off the reshuffle. But wasn't Michelle Obama's speech great at the Democratic convention! She certainly took my tips to heart, unlike my ex-lover who I can't identify because he's a former prime minister. So let's just call him JM. He's a sorry sight nowadays and has put on weight.</p> <p><strong>Antibes (Edwina's French bolthole) Friday 7 September:</strong> That Naomi Wolf, what a narcissist publishing a smutty book about front bottoms. Not what a fearless but respectable Scouse lass like me would do. But Cameron's reshuffle is looking worse. The tabloids say he was roaring drunk when he sacked poor Cheryl Gillan (lay off the chocs, darling) and threw Justine Greening down the stairs. These men \u2013 they think it makes them look tough. But Boris Johnson is managing to show him up. A pity I had to spurn Boris's overtures. But he was only nine, bless him.</p> <p><strong>Nice airport, Sunday 9 September:</strong> One of my kids rang tonight asking to borrow my Karl Lagerfeld suit. I ask you, young people today, it's all \"me, me, me\". No wonder George Osborne finds it so hard to connect with ordinary voters, he's barely out of Oxford. Some people just don't have the common touch \u2013 \"unlike you, Edwina\" as I once remember Michael Heseltine saying in front of Bill Clinton. Now Bill, he knew how to treat a lady, loved my cameo role on Strictly.</p> <p><strong>Belgravia flat, Monday 10 September:</strong> I've been watching question time on the parliament channel. What a bunch of losers. How did I stand that bad breath for 14 years? But it was great to see Esther McVey becoming a minister. She's from Liverpool, too, and even looks at bit like me from some angles. I hope she's not being harassed by all those blokes. Her boss, that Duncan Smith, always talks like a goody goody, but you can never tell. Just look at JM, my ex-lover. No one would have guessed what a bluebeard he was until I let it slip in my first Diaries (Amazon 45p).</p> <p><strong>M3 traffic jam, Tuesday 11 September: </strong>An exhausting book promotion takes me to Radio Pompey in the top 6.50am slot. But I later grabbed some downtime with the TV in the foyer. That Sebastian Coe, what a smoothie! How did I overlook his potential when we used to work out together in the Commons gym? Seb's been up before the home affairs (I'm an expert!) select committee and even Keith Vaz (too much pudding, Keith?) praised his running of the Olympics. No fun at all then. The TV news says Labour's Tessa Jowell has thrown in the towel. Some women just can't hack it. But I am cheered to hear George Osborne announce that there will be open competition to succeed Mervyn (what a bore!) King as governor of the Bank of England. I must remind George that I read PPE at Oxford. Appointing a woman would improve Britain's doddery image abroad. I once told the Queen as much, but she ignored me. Just look at her now!</p>",
  "<p>The new generation of secret courts proposed by the government could suppress evidence of British collusion in torture, according to the chief UN official responsible for investigating wrongdoing by security and intelligence agencies.</p> <p>Concern about the government's plan \u2013 contained in the <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/lbill/2012-2013/0027/13027.pdf\" title=\"\">justice and security bill</a> \u2013 was expressed by Prof Juan M\u00e9ndez, the UN's special rapporteur on torture. \"If a country is in possession of information about human rights abuses, but isn't in a position to mention them, it hampers the ability to deal effectively with torture,\" he said. M\u00e9ndez, himself a victim of torture in his native Argentina in the 1970s, was speaking at the thinktank Chatham House on Monday night.</p> <p>After attacking the US for what he called the \"extensive use of state secrets\" to suppress evidence of torture and other abuses, M\u00e9ndez referred to the so-called control principle, which allows governments to determine how its intelligence can be used once shared with another state.</p> <p>Ministers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/may/29/secret-justice-bill-not-perfect\" title=\"\">maintain that the new secret courts are needed</a> to protect its intelligence-sharing relationship with the US and other governments, while <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/09/secret-justice-bill\" title=\"\">critics say they are intended to conceal evidence of crimes</a> committed by the British government, including involvement in the rendition and torture of British citizens suspected of being terrorists.</p> <p>The issue was at the centre of high court hearings about the treatment of Binyam Mohamed, the Ethiopian-born UK resident secretly rendered to Guant\u00e1namo Bay after being seized in Pakistan in 2002.</p> <p>The high court ruled that CIA information that revealed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/10/binyam-mohamed-torture-ruling-evidence\" title=\"\">MI5 and MI6 knew of Mohamed's ill-treatment</a> should be disclosed. The ruling provoked a storm of protest, with some in the government claiming the US had threatened to withhold intelligence from the UK.</p> <p>At the same time, to avoid further incriminating evidence being disclosed, the UK government paid undisclosed sums, believed to amount to millions of pounds, in an out-of-court settlement to British citizens and residents who had been incarcerated in Guant\u00e1namo Bay.</p> <p>The government responded by introducing the justice and security bill, which would prevent the disclosure of any information in the hands of the security and intelligence agencies from being disclosed in civil cases.</p> <p>M\u00e9ndez said the control principle might be a good way of maintaining a good working relationship with other governments but could hinder attempts to suppress torture.</p> <p>He said he had expressed his concerns to the British government during discussions over the decision to suspend the work of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/13/uk-investigations-torture-rendition-guide\" title=\"\">Gibson inquiry</a>, the commission appointed by David Cameron in 2010, after police announced they were investigating <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/08/special-report-britain-rendition-libya\" title=\"\">the UK's role in the rendition of Libyan dissidents and their families to Tripoli</a> in 2004.</p> <p>While describing the talks as \"confidential\", M\u00e9ndez said he had specifically raised the problems that could be caused by the control principle and what he called the \"important issue\" of governments \"aiding and abetting torture\" by agents of other countries.</p> <p>In a clear reference to the treatment of terror suspects after the 11 September 2001 attacks on the US, M\u00e9ndez said torture had been used by states that claimed to be the strongest supporters of human rights.</p> <p>Defending the government's proposals, a Cabinet Office spokesperson said: \"Under the government's plans, nothing currently heard in open court could be heard in secret. Civil cases which are currently not heard at all \u2013 including cases where mistreatment is alleged \u2013 will be able to be fully investigated and scrutinised by the courts. The government has been clear that it stands firmly against torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment.\"</p> <p>In the European parliament, the Liberal Democrat European justice and human rights spokeswoman, Sarah Ludford, criticised EU states for failing to meet their obligations to carry out full, independent inquiries to investigate human rights violations.</p> <p>Referring to a report into alleged transportation and illegal detention of prisoners in European countries by the CIA, she said: \"It's vital that member states support independent inquiries to ascertain and secure accountability for their complicity in rendition and torture, without which we risk eroding citizens' trust in the democratic institutions of the EU to protect and promote our human rights.\"</p>",
  "<p>Germany's supreme court has long enjoyed a reputation that it is good for surprises. But its eight judges will never have felt their capacity for creating so much drama as in the run-up to a ruling they are due to deliver on Wednesday, and which could decide the future of the euro and even influence the world economy.</p> <p>The court in Karlsruhe is expected to announce whether Germany's participation in a permanent European bailout fund is in line with the country's constitution, a decision that has Angela Merkel's government on tenterhooks.</p> <p>If the court rules in favour of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and the fiscal pact on countries' budget limits, then debt-ridden countries like Spain and Greece will be able to be kept afloat as part of Europe's blueprint for tackling debt contagion in the eurozone.</p> <p>If the court rules against the plan, Europe may find itself in turmoil, with markets likely to react with panic to a decision that would have the potential to topple the single currency.</p> <p>A late legal challenge by a conservative member of the German parliament was rejected by the court on Tuesday, ensuring that the judges would stick to their original plan to deliver their long-awaited verdict on the bailout.</p> <p>But most analysts agree that the judges, not wishing to go down in history as the court that brought down the German government, and the euro and plunged the world economy into gloom, are likely vote in favour of the bailout mechanism.</p> <p>\"I don't think the court will strike down the ESM, because it wouldn't like to be seen to be killing off the euro. Just as the German government doesn't have the courage to do that, neither does the court. If it ruled that the government had adopted a wrong decision, it would cause a huge crisis of legitimacy in Germany,\" said Gunnar Beck, an EU law expert at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. \"Never in the 60-year history of the court has there been an example of the court killing an essential piece of government policy.\"</p> <p>What he and other analysts believe, though, is that the court will choose a \"middle way\" \u2013 allowing the ESM to go ahead but not without insisting on tight limits and conditions that would affect the Bundestag's decision-making procedures on future aid and further European integration.</p> <p>The court's decision not to accept the last-minute appeal by the eurosceptic MP Peter Gauweiler made a positive ruling more likely, analysts said. Gauweiler, who has plenty of allies within the government, had argued that Germany should not agree to the ESM until the European Central Bank reversed its bond-buying plan announced last week, which critics say will stoke inflation and offers no incentive for debt-ridden countries to reform. Gauweiler might still refile his challenge following the rejection.</p> <p>The case was brought by 37,000 petitioners, including academics, ordinary Germans, and members of Merkel's own party. Their main concern is that their taxes are being used to prop up parts of Europe they view as irresponsibly profligate.</p> <p>All eyes are on the constitutional court president, Andreas Vossk\u00fchle, who will deliver the historical verdict at 10am local time on Wednesday. Vossk\u00fchle, a quietly spoken 48-year-old lover of abstract art who eschews the limelight, is believed to support the growing concern in Germany that too much power is being ceded to Brussels. He once said the citizens of Germany \"shouldn't one morning wake up and find out that the people they elected have nothing to decide anymore\".</p> <h2>Sch\u00e4uble chastises US borrowing</h2> <p>Not content with taking a hard line with fellow eurozone countries that get too far into debt, Germany's finance minister turned his fire on America's borrowing habit.</p> <p>In a Bundestag speech to open a debate on the 2013 budget, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said worries about US debt were a burden for the global economy and questioned how the US would deal with high levels of government debt after the November presidential election \u2013 hitting back at Washington's criticism of Europe for failing to get a grip on its own debt crisis.</p> <p>In private, German officials often express concern about US debt levels and the inability of politicians there to reach a consensus on how to reduce it, but Sch\u00e4uble's public remarks underscore the extent of the worries in Germany.</p> <p>\"Ahead of the election in the US there is great uncertainty about the course American politics will take in dealing with government debts, which are much too high,\" Sch\u00e4uble said.</p> <p>\"We need to remind ourselves of that sometimes and the global economy knows that and is burdened by it.\"</p> <p>The issue has become a central theme of the US election campaign with Republican candidate Mitt Romney accusing President Barack Obama of fiscal mismanagement.</p>",
  "<p>Young journalists have to work hard to be taken seriously, the boyish writer and commentator Owen Jones warned students on Tuesday. \"Sometimes I get people asking me if I'm doing the paper round.\"</p> <p>He was one of the guests at the NUS-Amnesty student media summit in east London. The event was designed to help student journalists pick up useful advice from figures in the industry.</p> <p>It's tough to get a start in journalism these days. The journalism industry has shrunk considerably over the past decade, with a study conducted in 2010 estimating a 27% to 33% <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/oct/10/peter-preston-journalism-career\" title=\"\">reduction in paid positions</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://wannabehacks.co.uk/2012/09/04/why-its-not-a-surprise-applications-are-down-for-journalism-degrees/\" title=\"\">Applications to undergraduate journalism degrees were down</a> 18.95% this year, according to statistics from Ucas.

  "<p>Undergraduates! I greet you at the start of glorious careers! For what a time&#xa0;it is to be a student. You, more than any generation before you, have the opportunity to have a large number of browser windows open simultaneously. Truly it is a new world. And in this new world you will be able to express yourselves in ways no one in history has previously imagined.</p> <p>You can already in many places order a number of smaller plates rather than one large main dish, but without the difficult conversations this action would have involved in previous eras (the 90s). Ryanair will transport your physical being&#xa0;to practically any part of the EU for under \u00a310 (although there will be a \u00a379 surcharge if you wish your body parts to be transported intact and not split between flights). You, God help you, can&#xa0;download unlimited classics of world literature to your iPad for free, and then commission a developing-world student to read them for you and write an essay for a fee amounting to little more than the cost of a 5k Twitter following.</p> <p>What a world! A crunching economic downturn blights the horizon in terms of employment, that is true. But in this very inferno of old industries, old certainties, lies the opportunity to forge afresh new challenges! Maybe. I&#xa0;am not certain how this will work, but you have to agree it sounds at least theoretically possible.</p> <p>My friends, you stand at a cross-roads. One path leads to either economic hardship or a new flowering of human potential. The other path is the road less travelled by. The path ahead leads to we know not where, and the final path, from where we have just travelled (this is a crossroads, or if it is easier to visualise, a roundabout with four exits) is now barred by two guards, one of whom always tells the truth, and another who is carrying a fox, a bag of grain and would like to see the US embark on a nuclear confrontation with Iran. It is a confusing crossroads, or roundabout, and university in many ways is your opportunity to go round a few times (it's now definitely a roundabout) while you study the map and choose the particular exit you feel is the right one for you.</p> <p>But choose wisely! For if history has taught us only one thing, then this surely is an indication that it is underperforming as an academic discipline. Even geography tries to teach us a minimum of three things. But if history has taught us one thing, it is that those who do not learn its lessons are doomed to repeat them. The first time as tragedy, the second time as farce, the third time becoming increasingly irritated and the fourth time as part of a reunion tour where aged rock journalists take low-potency ecstasy tablets and complain about the&#xa0;acoustics.</p> <p>But what can I offer you as you take your first steps towards intellectual maturity? A couple of pointers. First: it is unfair that as students, as well as negotiating social and academic change, you are at the same time expected to succeed at the highest form of human endeavour and social interaction invented: communal&#xa0;living.</p> <p>For we know what happens when large groups of people are asked to live in close proximity. Waco. Jonestown. Indeed, as I understand it there has never been a successful communal living experiment. The finest minds have tried. Hawthorne, Thoreau, Stephen Baldwin on Celebrity Big Brother 7. All utopian communities have ended with the members secretly buying up rolls of stickers to mark the usage of toilet paper by their co-habitees. Many religious authorities suggest the unity of the apostles would have been seriously undermined had they been forced to share a fridge with&#xa0;Jesus.</p> <p>If you do end up living in a shared space, you need to have clear boundaries. What is acceptable to borrow? What is not? Can Dairylea be used as a temporary bath plug or grouting material and then returned to the owner for future consumption? Form a working party on establishing an equitable house temperature acceptable to all. Although it is now advisable to avoid 21.5 degrees, as this is the Aviva-sponsored Olympic Temperature\u2122 and if you use it you maybe liable to pay a royalty.</p> <p>One thing I can advise is not to have any truck with the rota. Nothing is sadder a few months down the line than the unobserved rota languishing reproachfully from the kitchen wall like the tattered Declaration of Universal Human Rights at the back of some repressive regime's kangaroo court.</p> <p>Similarly the revision timetable, when the time comes, is best avoided. Much wiser to fly, in terror, into a blind, random leafing through your books and notes, than to construct one of these schedules of dreams. If you do weaken and make one, keep it simple. If your revision timetable is embroidered, or illuminated with gold leaf, it is a sign you have probably spent enough time on it.</p> <p>Anyway. I wish you well. Life will never be the same again! The world entire is open for your inquiry! A wise man once told the story of the old fish who asked two young fishes how they liked the water they were swimming in. The young fishes' response? \"What the hell is water?\" As green younglings, you may not entirely \"get\" the wisdom of this observation. But let me interpret \u2013 the gist is: turn off your water at the stopcock during holidays and check your personal contents insurance covers flood damage.

  "<p>It took some time for the realisation to sink in that her grandson had finally claimed a grand slam title. \"After he had actually won, I just sat there,\" says Shirley Erskine, her husband, Roy, beside her in their conservatory, with its well-worn armchairs, unfinished jigsaw and windows overlooking Dunblane golf course.</p> <p>\"And I said: 'He's done it. He's done it.' It was such a funny feeling. You've wanted this all along and suddenly it's there and you can't take it all in. But it is absolutely wonderful.\"</p> <p>Shirley and Roy Erskine live a few hundred metres from the tennis court where Andy Murray first began swinging a racket aged four. A leather-bound cuttings book sits open on a table, each page holding carefully cropped newspaper articles tracing their grandson's progress. It is the seventh volume.</p> <p>The swelling mounds of unfiled cuttings nearby tell the story of Murray's triumphant summer. Roy, an optician, measures up the task ahead of him: \"It's going to run into two volumes. I have now reached the final against Federer at Wimbledon. I have still got the Olympics, the two tournaments he's played in America since, and now there's the US Open. And that will be a massive one.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395994291\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/11/1347381497136/Roy-and-Shirley-Erskine-004.jpg\" alt=\"Roy and Shirley Erskine\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roy and Shirley Erskine at Wimbledon this summer. Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"This year has been pretty good,\" says Shirley, with studied understatement.</p> <p>The cuttings collection started when Murray left Dunblane aged 15 to begin intense professional training in Spain. Friends and neighbours have a ritual, wholly in keeping with the town's steadfast loyalty and admiration for the star: they bring round all their papers \u2013 the Times, the Guardian, the Scotsman, the Telegraph \u2013 each time Murray features in print.</p> <p>The Erskines admit to a profound sense of relief. They have watched their grandson lose four grand slam finals and seen his hopes, his performance levels and his reputation ebb and flow, and now the tension has gone.</p> <p>\"The pressure is intense [from] being the sole Brit,\" says Shirley. \"We always tease him about being Britain's last hope. He has been on his own really, with no backup whatsoever, and naturally all the attention is on this one British player. That business of Fred Perry in 1936 [the last British male player to win a grand slam] is brought up and thrown at him, to remind him what people are expecting. I can't imagine how he must be feeling today but he will be euphoric. He must be.\"</p> <p>Roy says Murray has seemed a different player in the past six months. \"There's no question that the Olympics gave him a tremendous boost. He had such a convincing win over Federer. In the very first ball of the Olympics final, he was right into that match and we saw a positive side to him. He was so desperate to get a medal for the team.\"</p> <p>Murray's victory is the talk of Dunblane. In one cafe, a customer shouts over the noise of a coffee machine: \"What about Andy Murray! What a boy!\"</p> <p>Kate Oliver, a council officer, has lived in a property overlooking the all-weather courts at Dunblane sports club for 21 years. She says the town's adoration of Murray is built on respect for his resilience \u2013 and his flaws. \"He's human and he's real. We can relate to him,\" Oliver says. \"He's known where he's wanted to get to, and gone for it. I've watched him since he was the height of the tennis nets, playing with his mum. It's just determination and true grit.\"</p> <p>Outside his shop, the butcher Graham Fleming presents photographers with two trays carrying Andy's Big Apple Grand Slam sausages and Andy's Grand Slam Saltire burgers. Newspaper front pages with hefty Murray headlines are taped to the shop's windows.</p> <p>A few metres away is the commemorative gold postbox painted by Royal Mail after Murray won his Olympic medal. Tourists, residents and visitors have been posing for photographs with it, Fleming says, and it has been repainted several times, as trophy-hunters have been chipping off the gold paint with keys.</p> <p>Early on Tuesday morning it was a focal point for the town's celebrations. During the day, football fans en route to watch Scotland play Macedonia in Glasgow detoured to Dunblane to mark the occasion.</p> <p>\"It's been there for four weeks now and it's just been non-stop,\" Fleming says. \"The first Sunday there was a queue right the way down the road, with people waiting to get photographed. Even at three o'clock this morning there was a huge crowd out there, and the police were out trying to control them. They'd been in the pub all night and were trying to dance on top of it.\"</p> <p>As the town's florist, Irene Flaws is a woman close to Dunblane's pulse, called on to help mark anniversaries, weddings, funerals and birthdays. Like many others, she has been absorbed in Murray's fortunes on the court. \"It's a happy town today,\" she says. \"I don't think many of us had much sleep last night, right enough.\"</p> <p>Murray's triumphs have helped transform Dunblane's standing, 16 years after the shootings at the primary school. \"We go on holiday now and folk say 'where do you come from', and you're proud to say Dunblane because they relate it to Andy now, rather than what we've gone through in the past,\" Flaws says. \"It just raises the morale.\"</p>",
  "<p>9/11 was the day America has promised never to forget, but today, 11 years on, is the quietest anniversary of that terrible day we have yet seen.</p> <p>Last year, the tenth anniversary and the first after the death of Osama bin Laden, felt almost like the final one. Today, most newspapers have some pro forma editorial on the importance of \"pausing to reflect\", and the two presidential campaigns are suspended. But here in New York, the commemorations are minor, and the nation's politicians are not in town. In Washington, the National Cathedral isn't even bothering to hold a special service.</p> <p>September 11, as we never expected, is close to becoming just another day.</p> <p>If you go down to the World Trade Center site, you'll see some propaganda that the reconstruction process is \"picking up speed\", and that the city and the nation are \"honoring the victims\". But it won't feel that way. After 11 whole years, only one new building \u2013 7 World Trade Center, a block and a half away from Ground Zero \u2013 is open to tenants. Fumihiko Maki's 4 World Trade Center, the sole important work of architecture yet to arise from the ashes, is just reaching completion; Richard Rogers's 3 World Trade Center hasn't even begun to rise.</p> <p>And as for 1 World Trade Center \u2013 the compromised, tacky behemoth that looks exported from a third-tier Chinese boomtown \u2013 the hope now is to have it open by the end of 2013, years behind schedule.</p> <p>It's worth remembering who's to blame for this inferior monster of a skyscraper, complete with a 15-story, window-free bunker of a base, and the endless delays to its construction. In 2003, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, tasked with choosing a master planner, selected an ambitious design by the Think group, featuring a soaring pair of lattice structures in which individual buildings could be suspended. It would have been a glorious addition to the city's skyline.</p> <p>The LMDC members thought their decision was final. But Bloomberg and George Pataki, then New York's governor, thought otherwise.</p> <p>Everyone knew Pataki wanted to run for president \u2013 remember the 2004 GOP convention at Madison Square Garden? And in those dark days of Bush warfare, the governor could not resist the entreaties of Daniel Libeskind, who wore an American flag pin to meetings and cunningly proposed that the tallest tower (the \"Freedom Tower\", he called it) would top out at a sentimental 1,776 feet. He overruled his own selection committee, even after the selection of Think had been leaked to the press. \"The decision was crammed down our throats,\" <a href=\"http://movies2.nytimes.com/2006/09/11/nyregion/nyregionspecial3/11groundzero.html?pagewanted=all\">one LMDC member lamented in 2006</a>. </p> <p>And Pataki's unilateral decision, which pushed aside transformative architecture in place of something much more corporate, made it easier for the owner of the World Trade Center Site, the pugnacious Larry Silverstein, to oust Libeskind and install his own architect, David Childs, as head of the 1WTC building project. You know what follows: endless wrangling, less aspiring and more martial design, and a tower whose only virtue is being tall.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396004873\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/10/1347307607199/911-memorial-new-york-006.jpg\" alt=\"9/11 memorial new york\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Visitors to the National September 11 Memorial and Museum look at one of two reflecting pools at the World Trade Center.

Thankfully, it does not descend into the Bush kitsch of recent projects, such as Washington's offensive second world war cenotaph, with its eagles and laurel wreaths. But the memorial's predictable, minimalism-for-beginners design \u2013 waterfalls, list of names, rows of trees \u2013 doesn't hang together at the enormous scale our leaders demanded. The memorial had to preserve the footprints of the Twin Towers, each as large as a city block, and the experience is exhausting. Perhaps it looks all right from the bankers' eyries above Ground Zero.</p> <p>And the museum that should accompany the memorial is a long way off. It was supposed to open three years ago, but you know how money troubles are. Late on Monday night, the governors of New York and New Jersey <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444100404577644290597001100.html?mod=WSJ_latestheadlines\">cut a long-delayed deal</a> that allows construction to continue on the museum \u2013 but the very fact of the dispute suggests that nobody really cares enough to get it done.</p> <p>I'm harping on the failure to rebuild downtown Manhattan not only because I'm an irritable New Yorker, but also because I think it's symptomatic. Not too long ago, it would have been unthinkable for a politician or a major economic stakeholder to hold up progress at the site. The press would have flayed them; their reputations would be wrecked. </p> <p>But something has changed between then and now. Worrying about the fate of the museum at Ground Zero, or even paying attention to the ructions between our governors and the mayor, now seems like a specialist concern rather than a matter of national or even city-wide importance. It wasn't supposed to be this way \u2013 and it's not just the passage of time that has made 9/11 recede into the background.</p> <p>In the years after 2001, the narrative of the future was clear. We had a cold war, followed by an end-of-history decade a la Fukuyama. And then, on 9/11, the end of history was over; the \"war on terror\", or the Clash of Civilizations (the neocons loved capital letters in those days), had begun.</p> <p>But it hasn't panned out thus, not by a long shot. The clash of civilizations has not come. Appalling terrorism and crusading retribution are not, in spite of it all, the themes of contemporary American life. For the millions of dead, displaced and wounded in Iraq, 9/11 did indeed change everything. But for most Americans, its most visible and enduring legacy is the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/jul/15/internet-privacy\">giant body scanners</a> at the airport. Even New Yorkers don't think of it very much.</p> <p>What if it was the collapse of Lehman Brothers, rather than of the World Trade Center, that really marked the start of the new, darker American century?</p> <p>The financial crisis \u2013 like 9/11, a temporary name that stuck \u2013 is now four years old. What looked at first like a scary crash, and then like a prolonged downturn, has been revealed as something much larger: the moment of rupture, the point after which nothing will be the same. Maybe there will be, five or ten years in the future, another shock that turns this crisis into only (only!) a lost decade. But it seems more likely that all the historical baggage we had dumped on 9/11 \u2013 the day, we now know, that did not change everything \u2013 might weigh more on 2008 than 2001.</p> <p>On 9/11, we were told that the future hinges on war. But the future, it turns out, hinges on economics.</p> <p>For the millions of Americans, though, who still grieve for the victims of 9/11, who look at the skyline of New York and feel the absence of those towers like a ghost limb, there might be something to salvage: the banking crisis, and the wider depression it precipitated, have made all the pledges to \"rebuild\" and to \"come back stronger\" after 9/11 seem pathetically anachronistic.</p> <p>There is not going to be another American century. And for that, al-Qaida is not to blame. In such circumstances, perhaps we may finally find a way to look at the horrendous crime of 9/11 on its own terms, rather than those of our politicians. Then, at last, we might get back to the business of comforting the living and mourning the dead.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow Jason on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jsf\">@jsf</a></p>",
  "<p>Two of France's most powerful tycoons have squared up to sling insults in a public spat over who should pay what taxes under the country's Socialist government.</p> <p>In the left corner, Baron Edouard de Rothschild, scion of the Gallic arm of the banking family and main shareholder in the left-leaning daily newspaper Lib\u00e9ration. In the right, Bernard Arnault, billionaire businessman and head of the luxury goods group LVMH \u2013 Louis Vuitton Mo\u00ebt Hennessy \u2013 the richest man in France, and the world's fourth richest, according to Forbes magazine.</p> <p>It was Arnault who, arguably, threw the first punch when he announced that he was seeking to become a Belgian. This raised speculation that president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's determination to enforce a new \"super-tax\" \u2013 a 75% band rate for those earning more than \u20ac1m (\u00a3800,000), no exceptions \u2013 might have had something to do with the decision.</p> <p>Lib\u00e9ration replied with a front-page picture of a smiling Arnault carrying a suitcase under the headline \"Get lost, rich jerk\", a play on the comment by Nicolas Sarkozy to a visitor at the national agriculture show. When the man refused to shake his hand, the former rightwing president snapped: \"Get lost, poor jerk.\"</p> <p>The tycoon, the paper said, was applying for Belgian nationality so he could move to Monaco. A tax agreement between Paris and Monte Carlo means French people living in the Riviera principality are subject to French taxes. Belgians are not.</p> <p>Arnault, whose personal fortune is estimated at around $26bn (\u00a316bn), denied he was trying to wriggle out of Hollande's calls for \"solidarity\", and said he wanted to go north for \"personal reasons\". He announced he was suing the paper for \"public insults and injury\", describing the headline as \"violent and vulgar\".</p> <p>Enter Baron Rothschild, who went on French television on Tuesday to mount a strong defence of the newspaper. \"I'm not shocked. It's in keeping with Lib\u00e9ration's provocative style and I think it's a wonderful marketing operation,\" he said.</p> <p>Rothschild said it was the correct line for Lib\u00e9ration to take. \"It seems to me that when those who are among the most well off are asked to make an effort for two years, an effort of national solidarity, one adapts to this.\"</p> <p>On Tuesday Lib\u00e9ration announced in the headline on the story: \"Bernard, if you come back, we'll cancel everything.\"</p> <p>Again, the headline harked back to a text message Sarkozy was alleged to have sent to estranged second wife C\u00e9cilia after meeting third wife Carla Bruni, reading: \"If you come back, I'll cancel everything.\"</p> <p>Lib\u00e9ration carried a front-page advertisement for a new perfume by Yves Saint Laurent, a rival of LVMH, and changed the background to its title from red to purple: matching the colour of the YSL logo that took up a third of the newspaper cover.</p> <p>Lib\u00e9ration denied the YSL adverts were a dig at Arnault, saying the spot had been booked a long time ago.</p> <p>Arnault, who has opposed Hollande's economic programme, has also denied trying to reduce his tax bill. \"I will remain fiscally domiciled in France, and as such, will fulfil all my fiscal obligations, like all French people,\" he told AFP.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Rothschild denied there was anything fishy about his acquiring Israeli nationality, insisting he was a keen equestrian and needed double nationality to take part in the sport \"at the highest level\".</p> <p>\"The acquisition of this second nationality did not deprive the French tax authorities of a single euro. It's completely different, and so is the timing,\" he said, adding that he was prepared to pay his French taxes \"wholeheartedly\".</p>",
  "<p>Nawab had been crowned the best skateboarder in Afghanistan, a joker and unofficial leader of the unruly gang. Mohammad Esa was perhaps the cleverest of his friends, always studying or lost in dreams of the day he would become a doctor. Khorshid was an uncompromising teenager whose name meant sunshine but whose character was steel, always ready to show the boys she could do anything they could, despite growing up in a country that is not kind to women.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396002502\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/11/1347381224514/Kabul-skate-children-006.jpg\" alt=\"Kabul skate children\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Khorshid.

On a recent holiday they walked several miles to a reservoir out of town, to swim and picnic, before walking all the way back again to work in the afternoon. In a country splintered by bitter ethnic divisions, they were an unusual mix of Pashtuns and Tajiks.</p> <p>But on Saturday a teenage boy in a white shalwar kameez walked onto their patch, and when some of the boys told him to leave, an argument broke out. It escalated into shouting, then blows, and then ended abruptly when the stranger pressed a hidden trigger and detonated a suicide bomb, according to 14-year-old Reza, who survived because he had wandered off to buy a snack, watching the dispute from a distance. </p> <p>Police said the bomber was probably aiming for the nearby Nato or US embassy gates. He may have panicked when the children blocked his way, or perhaps given up hope of getting past them when the fighting began. One survivor does not even remember a fight, which raises the possibility the children were the target.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396002503\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/11/1347381045060/Kabul-skate-kids-006.jpg\" alt=\"Kabul skate kids\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mohammad Esa.

But it has ripped apart the circle of friends. Nawab, Mohammad Esa, Khorshid, her sister Parwana and young brother-in-law Asad are dead, and two others from the group in hospital with serious injuries.</p> <p>\"When I go to bed, my friends are all waiting for me, asking me to come swimming,\" said 14-year-old Omid, one of the group who was travelling in to work when the bomber struck. \"I see their faces, and I can't sleep.\"</p> <p>Several of the dead were also the main breadwinners for their families; one father disabled, another a drug addict, with many younger brothers and sisters to feed. Their killings bring more than just the agonising loss of a sibling or child to grieving families.</p> <p>They are the latest children to suffer in a war that damages hundreds of young lives each year. \"1,756 children were killed or seriously injured as a result of the conflict in 2011, which equates to nearly five children a day,\" said Unicef spokesman Alistair Gretarsson.</p> <p>In Nawab's home, packed with dozens of mourners, his family remembered a quiet 16-year-old, who liked eggs for breakfast when he could afford them and ignored their pleas to stop working near Nato. \"He was a very serious person, busy from morning to evening with his business,\" said his mother, Anisa, her face bruised and scratched from where she had battered it in mourning. \"After God, he was the person who fed the family.\"</p> <p>Nawab was different with his friends, says Omid, he was a joker and a natural leader, who looked out for the younger kids. He won the \"Go Skateboarding\" competition this year, and worked as a volunteer skateboarding teacher.</p> <p>He is buried nearby in a new graveyard that is marching up a hill, coffin by coffin, testament to the steady toll of the war and poverty in Afghanistan. There is a spectacular view of the city from his burial mound, where Omid stared at the dust and swore revenge. \"I have to find the people who killed my friend,\" he said. \"I want to become a pilot in the army.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396002504\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/11/1347381306298/Kabul-skate-children.-006.jpg\" alt=\"Kabul skate children.\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Parwana.

But if you do things, all that can happen is you succeed or fail.\"</p> <p>Her six-year-old sister Mersal survived the blast because she was playing down the street, but saw both her sisters' bodies. \"Khorshid was broken,\" she said, her eyes filling with tears. \"Do you have any pictures of my daughters?\" their mother, Jemila, asked a visiting journalist. The family was too poor to have a single print of their children.</p> <p>The families of those who survived have banned them from working outside Nato, and are filled with relief. \"We have told him to stop working and just concentrate on school,\" said Reza's older brother Mustafa. But the children themselves are haunted by their own escape, in a country where only a tiny minority have access to counselling services.</p> <p>\"I looked down at myself and saw I was covered with blood, then I passed out,\" said Naved, 15, stranded in Kabul's emergency hospital with a shattered hand and shrapnel wounds to his shoulder, leg and side. \"When I woke up, I saw the bodies of my friends lying on the ground and tried to go closer, but the police stopped me.\"</p> <p>He survived the bomb because of a chance thirst; he had walked a few metres down the street to a handpump a minute before the bomber detonated.</p> <p>Three years ago another bomb killed a group of street children just a few metres down the road, but many in the group have the recklessness of kids around the world, made many times more dangerous by their surroundings. \"I never thought it might be dangerous,\" Naved said of working near the heart of the western military mission.</p> <p>Elias, in hospital with serious injuries to his legs, ignored his parents' warnings that the national holiday might attract attacks and went into town with Nawab. \"I think I was closest to the bomber, but God saved me. I don't know why.\" He doesn't know what he will do when he gets out of hospital. \"I have no feelings now, except sadness for my friends who are dead.\"</p>",
  "<h2>The winner: the weather</h2> <p>Sunny weather in September is always a particular challenge for cinemas, as audiences tend to consider that this may be the last chance of the year to enjoy the sun, and are not going to pass it up. Arriving at the end of a summer that's had more than its fair share of rainfall, the sunshine proved an irresistible attraction for most of us, with any cinema plans put on hold until another, greyer day. Despite the arrival of some significant cinematic attractions, box-office fell 42% from the previous weekend, and overall the frame was the third worst of the past year.</p> <p>Emerging the winner of a thin field with \u00a31.05m, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/149147/dredd\" title=\"Dredd on theguardian.com/film\">Dredd</a> was able to claim bragging rights, the first 18-certificate film to top the chart since 2010. But the gross was the lowest for a number-one film since the climax of Euro 2012 football, when successive weeks of virtually no major releases culminated with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/148325/ice-age-4\" title=\"on theguardian.com/film\">Ice Age 4: Continental Drift </a>grabbing the top spot from its early rollout in Scotland, Ireland and Northern Ireland only.</p> <p>Although Dredd is the first 18-certificate chart-topper since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/137860/saw-3d\" title=\"on theguardian.com/film\">Saw 3D</a> in October 2010, that achievement needs to be put in context. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/131882/girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo\" title=\"on theguardian.com/film\">Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</a>, also 18 certificate, opened in the runner-up spot at the end of 2011 with \u00a34.33m including \u00a32.76m in previews. Even stripping out those significant preview takings, it achieved \u00a31.57m over the three-day weekend, and one of those days was New Year's Eve, which is not a good day for cinema attendance.</p> <h2>The losers: everything else</h2> <p>Be they a new entrant or an existing title, all films wilted in the sun. The gentlest decline for a wide release was experienced by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0431021/\" title=\"on IMDb\">The Possession</a>, down 45%. Everything else fell more than 50% from the previous weekend, and several top titles (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146821/brave\" title=\"on theguardian.com/film\">Brave</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/147726/bourne-legacy\" title=\"on theguardian.com/film\">The Bourne Legacy</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/148845/expendables-2\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">The Expendables 2</a>) fell 60% or more, in certain cases compounded by a steep drop in screen count. <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2147365/\" title=\"on IMDb\">Keith Lemon: The Film</a> plunged 79%, following a 69% drop the previous weekend.</p> <p>Landing in second place, moonshine-distilling western <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146652/lawless\" title=\"on theguardian.com/film\">Lawless</a> kicked off its run with \u00a3973,000 including \u00a382,000 in previews. With a cast including Tom Hardy, Shia LaBeouf, Gary Oldman, Jessica Chastain, Mia Wasikowska and Guy Pearce, that's a disappointing number. John Hillcoat's previous film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/131971/road\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">The Road </a>debuted with \u00a3627,000 back in January 2010, but that was from just 157 screens, as against 410 for Lawless. An 18 certificate \"for strong bloody violence and strong language\" might be considered a handicap, but you'd think Lawless's tale of heroic bootleggers resisting corrupt law enforcement, plus a side order of romance, would have broad appeal.</p> <p>With \u00a3876,000, Working Title's latest literary adaptation <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/149093/anna-karenina\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">Anna Karenina</a> likewise disappointed in third place. This is the company's third picture with director Joe Wright, following<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/107877/pride.and.prejudice\" title=\"at theguardian.com\"> Pride and Prejudice</a> (debut of \u00a32.53m including \u00a3270,000 in previews) and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/119568/atonement\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">Atonement</a> (\u00a31.63m). Reteaming the director with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/keiraknightley?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"the actor at theguardian.com/film\">Keira Knightley</a> and a period classic previously proved a winning formula, but audiences have so far not flocked to their collaboration on the Leo Tolstoy doorstopper. Critical responses to the adventurous theatrical presentation have tended towards praise for trying something new, tempered by some reservations about the outcome. At Rotten Tomatoes, scores from all critics (65% fresh), top critics (67% fresh) and site users (64% like it) are untypically similar. Midweek grosses are traditionally healthy for older-skewing upscale fare, so it's by no means all over for this one.</p> <p>Adam Sandler's latest, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146343/that-s-my-boy\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">That's My Boy</a>, landed disastrously outside the top 10, with just \u00a3255,000. His last effort, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/145608/jack-and-jill\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">Jack and Jill</a>, debuted with \u00a3849,000 in February.</p> <p>Although all films experienced a rough weekend, Universal will take comfort that its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/148370/ted\" title=\"the acerbic bear at theguardian.com/film\">Ted</a> (down 52%), with \u00a329.19m, is now in sniffing distance of Ice Age 4 (\u00a329.24m), the third biggest hit so far in 2012. (In fact, reports reach us that last night, Monday, Ted overtook Ice Age 4.) And Disney will be pleased that Brave, with \u00a319.34m, will soon be the 11th film to cross the \u00a320m barrier this year. Many successful animated films have run out of puff around this box office level, so if Brave can push a little harder, it will overtake <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/125070/kung.fu.panda\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">Kung Fu Panda</a> (\u00a320.3m), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/140039/tangled\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">Tangled</a> (\u00a320.5m), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/144411/arthur-christmas\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">Arthur Christmas</a> (\u00a320.8m) and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/129059/monsters-vs.-aliens\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">Monsters Vs Aliens</a> (\u00a321.4m).</p> <h2>The event</h2> <p>Although sunshine was the predictable enemy for all regular releases, it proved otherwise for Future Cinema's presentation of Grease, attracting more than 9,000 punters to London's Barnes Common for what it billed as \"the ultimate Grease experience\". The creators of the more famous brand Secret Cinema will take heart from such a success under the Future Cinema banner, indicating that it's the participatory themed experience, rather than the surprise element, that is key to appeal. A gross of \u00a3290,000 would have been enough to earn Grease tenth place in the box-office chart, had it been tracked by the official data gatherer \u2013 and this from a single venue.</p> <p>The distributor of concert film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2012/aug/31/lcd-soundsystem-exclusive-clip\" title=\"at theguardian.com\">Shut Up and Play the Hits</a>, which captures the last ever performance of LCD Soundsystem, also sparked audience interest through building a one-off event. The lion's share of its \u00a369,500 opening comes from last Tuesday's premiere at the Hackney Picturehouse, including a live Q+A with frontman James Murphy and other band members, which was relayed to 59 other sites nationwide. (See \"Other openers\" below for the breakdown.)</p> <h2>The arthouse market</h2> <p>Unless you count Anna Karenina, playing wide on nearly 500 screens, there are no arthouse titles in the top 15, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/145816/imposter\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">The Imposter</a>, in 17th place, flying the flag for the sector. Grosses fell significantly, presumably due to the double whammy of period-drama Keira and the sunshine, but joint distributors Revolver and Picturehouse will take comfort from The Imposter's gross to date of \u00a3889,000. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/145818/shadow-dancer\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">Shadow Dancer</a>, which is performing better in Ireland than elsewhere, also fell hard, and is now at \u00a3674,000. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/148212/berberian-sound-studio\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">Berberian Sound Studio</a> dropped a gentler 57%, and has achieved \u00a397,000 after 10 days. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/143130/samsara\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">Samsara</a> is right behind it, with \u00a395,000, also after 10 days.</p> <h2>The future</h2> <p>With the market down 29% on the equivalent frame from 2011, and 44% down on average weekend takings for the past year, cinemas are crying out for strong fresh product, and preferably some more conducive weather for cinema going. Arriving Wednesday is Nick Love's take on 70s TV cop classic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146754/sweeney\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">The Sweeney</a>, starring Ray Winstone and Ben Drew. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/148983/hope-springs\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">Hope Springs</a>, with Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones rekindling their stale marriage, is aiming for the currently buoyant older audience.

  "<p><strong>Moneysupermarket.com</strong>, the price comparison website which recently bought Martin Lewis' MoneySavingExpert for up to \u00a387m, is coming under attack from Google in one of its key market.</p> <p>Google has launched a car insurance comparison site following forays into credit card, savings and current account comparison. David McCann at Numis said car insurance was Moneysupermarket's biggest division, accounting for around 55% of revenues. In a sell note on the company, he said:</p> <blockquote> Moneysupermarket unjustifiably trades on a premium rating given the threat to earnings from Google taking some of its share of the value chain (we calculate Google traffic accounts for over half of its earnings). <br> Google has already invested more than \u00a340m in UK financial price comparison and has recently started cannibalising high value search terms (eg \"credit cards\") to drive traffic to their own site, some of which would have previously gone to Moneysupermarket.  Most of the earnings \"at risk\" is that derived from free search results, which the company reports to date has not been materially impacted by Google's initial efforts and management claim they have successfully adapted to numerous changes in the free search algorithms in the past. Nonetheless, we feel that this is a subtlety different type of change to those in the past and that it is impossible to predict how consumer click behaviour might change in the future in response to explicit actions by Google trying to tempt visitors to click their own links. </blockquote> <p>Moneysupermarket closed 6p lower at 133p.</p> <p>Overall the market ended virtually unchanged once more as investors braced themselves for Wednesday's German court decison on the European fiscal treaty and the ESM bailout fund, as well as the Dutch election and Thursday's US Federal Reserve meeting. The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished down just 1.01 points at 5792.19.</p> <p>The biggest faller was <strong>Burberry, </strong>whose shock profit warning reverberated around the luxury goods sector. Burberry plunged 287p to \u00a310.88, a 21% decline, while luxury handbag maker <strong>Mulberry</strong> was down 57p to \u00a313.01.</p> <p>With copper prices easing, investors took some profits from the recent rise in the mining sector. <strong>Anglo American</strong> fell 46.5p to \u00a319.55, while <strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> fell 24.5p to 978.5p after India's Goa state said it was temporarily suspending iron ore mining to check if operations there were legal. So Vedanta subsidiary Sesa Goa has stopped ore extraction, and will submit all relevant documents as soon as possible.</p> <p><strong>Xstrata</strong> dipped 15p to 1011.5p as key shareholders the Qataris said they had not yet decided on their response to the latest bid proposals from <strong>Glencore</strong>, down 5.65p at 364.35p.</p> <p>B&amp;Q owner <strong>Kingfisher</strong> lost 9.4p to 272.3p after Deutsche Bank repeated a report cutting its recommendation from buy to hold.</p> <p>But <strong>Arm</strong> added 3p to 552p after UBS issued a buy note and raised its target price from 645p to 750p. Analyst Gareth</p> <blockquote> Jenkins said: <br>We believe Arm is in an excellent position to leverage many key themes in the digitisation occurring all around us.  Potential opportunities to Arm include encouraging \"hold-out\" customers into the Arm fold (eg Broadcom/Renesas), penetrating new markets (the networking market alone could add 7% and 18% to revenue and earnings respectively in five years), and providing the existing customer base with higher-value/royalty products. Other than the macro outlook, the key risk remains the loss of a major account to Intel, and while newsflow will remain mixed (expect a Motorola-Intel device soon, and a Samsung-Intel Tizen phone over time), we see a major disruption as unlikely. </blockquote> <p>Cigarette companies <strong>British American Tobacco</strong> and <strong>Imperial Tobacco</strong> edged higher despite analysts at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch saying it was too soon to turn positive on the companies:</p> <blockquote> BAT and Imperial have underperformed due to a recent surge in negative regulatory newsflow, unusually weak top-line trends in the latest quarterly results and sector rotation out of defensives. Near-term, we expect these headwinds to continue \u2013 regulatory headlines will likely continue until Europe's review of its Tobacco Products Directive at year-end, Philip Morris has confirmed ongoing weak European volumes, and consensus positioning is gradually turning more cyclical. </blockquote> <p>It remained neutral on both while preferring BAT. It cut its price target on BAT from \u00a334 to \u00a333 and on Imperial from \u00a327 to \u00a323.50, but these are both still above the current share price. BAT closed 57.5p higher at \u00a331.82 while Imperial rose 21p to \u00a322.71.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps spread betting group <strong>IG </strong>ended 28.3p higher at 461.7p after reporting first quarter revenues of \u00a381.5m, down 18% but in line with expectations.</p> <p>Defence equipment group <strong>Chemring</strong> fell 9.1p to 321.5p ahead of Fridays' deadline for potential purchaser Carlyle Group to make a firm bid for the company or walk away. Some analysts believe that, following a recent profit warning from Chemring, the private equity group may decide not to proceed.</p> <p>Finally Aim-listed drug discovery company <strong>Summit</strong> soared 30% to 3.25p. after it signed a technology agreement with US giant Bristol-Myers Squibb. Bristol-Myers will use Summit's seglin technology to identify and develop drug candidates for up to ten targets. It will pay Summit an initial $100,000 fee and milestone payments of up to $30m per product, plus royalties on any subsequent sales.</p>",
  "<p>The Palestinian prime minister has been forced to declare an emergency economic package after more than a week of escalating protests over rising prices in West Bank cities. Thousands of Palestinians have taken to the streets, some burning tyres, stoning buildings and clashing with security forces.</p> <p>Among the measures announced by Salam Fayyad, who has been the main target of protesters' anger\u201a were cancellation of recent price rises in fuel and cooking gas, a cut in VAT, a promise to pay half of the salaries due to public employees by Wednesday, and \"progressive deductions\" from the salaries of senior officials including ministers.</p> <p>The head of the Palestinian public transport union rejected the package. \"These decisions are unsatisfactory, and we will continue in our protests,\" Jawad Omran told Reuters.</p> <p>Fayyad called upon donor countries, particularly Arab states, to increase aid to the Palestinian Authority (PA). It was unclear whether the measures would prove sufficient to quell the protests.</p> <p>Hundreds of protesters took part in a peaceful demonstration in Ramallah on Tuesday evening after the announcement of the emergency package. On Monday, several thousand protesters threw stones and rocks at a police station and municipal offices in the volatile city of Hebron. Dozens of police officers and protesters were injured in clashes, during which tear gas was fired.</p> <p>Protests have hit Ramallah, Bethlehem, Jenin, Nablus, Tulkarem and Jericho, with roads blocked by burning tyres and rubbish bins. Strikes by taxi and bus drivers have paralysed the West Bank's transport system. Many schools and universities have also been shut.</p> <p>The immediate cause of the protests is anger over the rising cost of living. Petrol prices went up by 5%, to more than $2 a litre, after similar rises in Israel, which supplies fuel to the West Bank. The cost of basic foods is also up.</p> <p>Taxi drivers in Ramallah said the price cut announced by Fayyad, which would take the cost of fuel back to its August level, was not enough to stop strikes planned for coming days.</p> <p>Fayyad announced that the PA would pay its 153,000 employees half their August salaries immediately and would strive to pay the outstanding amounts within a week. The PA has been unable to pay full salaries since June because of shortfalls in aid donations. According to the World Bank, unemployment in the West Bank and Gaza is more than 20%, but the figure rises to almost 35% among young people.</p> <p>Initially the protests were welcomed by the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, who described them as the \"Palestinian spring\". Fayyad, an independent politician, is disliked by both main political factions, Fatah and Hamas, and is frequently accused of being too compliant with Israel and the West. Calls for his resignation have been widespread during recent days. However, some protesters have also called for Abbas to go and attacked PA corruption in general, indicating the potential for the protests to spin beyond the control of the dominant faction, Fatah.</p> <p>Some protesters have demanded the scrapping of a 1994 economic agreement signed between Israel and the Palestinians, known as the Paris protocol. It gave Israel control over the Palestinians' external trade and collection of customs duties on behalf of the PA, and pegged VAT and prices in the Palestinian territories to Israeli rates. Critics say it has led to prices in the West Bank being similar to those in Israel, while wages are around a third.</p> <p>Palestinian economist Sam Bahour said blame for the current economic crisis in the West Bank belonged to \"the Paris Protocol and Israel's occupation. The issue is the framework of occupation that is causing economic hardship, not a tax increase here or a tax increase there.\"</p> <p>One senior Palestinian official predicted that protesters' anger would be turned against Israel's occupation of the West Bank. \"People on the streets are suffering from a lack of income, high prices and restrictions on movement,\" said Nabil Shaath. \"This is a war against our total loss of political horizon. People are going back to struggle, non-violent struggle, and will eventually turn against Israel.\"</p>",

  "<p>Ten minutes walk from Frankfurt's main railway station, through a warren of sex shops and seedy gambling dens, two dozen of the most powerful unelected people on the continent gather once a fortnight to try to save Europe from itself.</p> <p>Around a large circular table on the 36th floor of the Eurotower that soars over the city centre red-light district, Mario Draghi chairs the meetings of the governing council of the European Central Bank which have supplanted EU summits and finance ministers' sessions as the key events deciding the fate of the euro \u2014 testimony to the failures and fecklessness of the EU's elected leaders.</p> <p>The Italian central banker radiates understated gravitas and charm, has been in office not even a year, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/06/mario-draghi-profile-ecb-eurozone-crisis\" title=\"\">has already been dubbed the euro's saviour, the most important central banker on the planet</a>, the most powerful person in Europe with the possible exception of chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.</p> <p>Draghi's expanding battery of weapons for combating the euro crisis is to be strengthened immensely on Wednesday when the European Commission unveils new draft legislation putting the ECB in charge of supervising the eurozone's 6,000 banks, with the power to grant and withdraw licences.</p> <p>Within a month of taking office last November, Draghi delivered a coup, launching a trillion-euro programme of cheap loans for Europe's banks. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/06/eurozone-crisis-ecb-unlimited-bond-buying\" title=\"\">Last Thursday he went much further</a>, announcing a new policy of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/06/ecb-bond-buying-10-essential-terms\" title=\"\">limitless purchasing of eurozone government bonds known as OMT \u2014 outright monetary transactions</a>.</p> <p>The markets went quiet, Spain, Italy, and Ireland rejoiced, as Draghi emphasised for the third time in six weeks that the euro is irreversible. He framed his bold intervention as solidly within his remit to defend the embattled currency.</p> <p>But German monetary purists erupted in howls of protest, although it was the German on the ECB's six-strong executive, J\u00f6rg Asmussen, who played a key role in drafting the new policy.</p> <p>\"Only a currency whose existence is out of the question can be stable,\" Asmussen told the Guardian in an interview. \"What for us is clearly within our mandate is to guarantee the stability of the euro.\" Extreme times generate extreme moves. There is no doubt that the eurozone's exhausted political leaders are quietly relieved that Draghi is taking some of the heat out of the crisis. While Merkel, the central actor in the euro drama, could never say so publicly, her aides have been known to concede that Draghi is the only person who can rescue the euro \u2013 so let him get on with it.</p> <p>And since the stakes could hardly be higher, for Asmussen the end would appear to justify the means.</p> <p>\"I see an incomplete currency area,\" he said. \"We're at a very decisive moment. We need to aim for more Europe, define our place on the globe in the 21st century. If we're not willing or able to embark on that route, all the achievements of the monetary union, and even of the single market, could be at risk. We don't know if we'll succeed, but we'll work for it.\"</p> <p>But the sweeping new banking supervisory powers, the bond market intervention, and the increasing influence the ECB wields over the fiscal and budgetary policies of the governments of the eurozone have many worried that the ECB president and the 22 others on the governing council \u2014 the 17 central bank chiefs of the eurozone plus the six-strong ECB executive, all men in suits, not a woman among them \u2014 are getting too big for their boots.</p> <p>\"The ECB is getting very powerful,\" said Jean Pisani-Ferry, director of the Bruegel thinktank in Brussels. \"It has emerged from the crisis as a strong institution. It deserves more powers, though this is a major challenge.\"</p> <p>Draghi's predecessor, Jean-Claude Trichet, played a key role behind the scenes in unseating Silvio Berlusconi as prime minister of Italy last year. Trichet's letters to the Irish government, some of them recently published by the Irish Times, show how he pressured Dublin into its eurozone bailout, arguing that the dire condition of the Irish banks was imperilling the entire European banking system.</p> <p>Through its involvement in the \"troika\" with the European Commission and International Monetary Fund, the ECB is dictating fiscal and economic policy to eurozone strugglers. And in Brussels, senior officials report that ECB staff are ubiquitous at crisis meetings, seeking to steer and influence policy-making by eurocrats and eurozone government officials.</p> <p>\"They're all over us, wanting to discuss legislation. We try to keep them at arm's length as it's none of their business,\" said one EU official. \"Now with the banking supervision, the buck will stop in Frankfurt. It seems the ECB's dream may be coming true.\"</p> <p>Asmussen dismisses the talk of an over-mighty central bank, indirectly describing the ECB's activism as a necessary response to the inadequacies of the eurozone's politicians.</p> <p>\"Nobody should think that the people in the ECB are megalomaniacs. We think we have an important mandate, but a limited one,\" he said. \"Some people say that the ECB was the only institution in the crisis able to act. That's crisis management. It cannot and it should not stay like this. We're slowly but surely working on empowering other institutions to be able to act.\"</p> <p>But the conditions Draghi says are needed to trigger the bout of bond-buying are frequently explicitly political demands of elected governments.</p> <p>\"The governing structure of the euro area has clear design flaws,\" said Asmussen. \"It should be clear to everyone that we stand ready to do our part, repairing the monetary transmission mechanism. But in order to be successful others must do their part. Member states must show fiscal discipline, regain competitiveness, and where needed clean up bank balance sheets. And the community of states in Europe must improve the institutional architecture of the incomplete monetary union.Only if these three elements are together can it work.\"</p> <p>Improving the euro's \"institutional architecture\" entails the 17 countries surrendering large chunks of sovereignty over budget and fiscal policy to a eurozone \"fiscal union\" seen as the logical successor to the \"banking union\" being proposed on Wednesday.</p> <p>While arguing that a common currency cannot function without common fiscal policies, the ECB is playing a much more overtly political role than it did before the crisis when, on the model of Germany's Bundesbank, it restricted itself to monetary policy-making, inflation-fighting, and jealously guarded its independence.</p> <p>Analysts say that that independence will be further eroded by the new powers over eurozone banks, resulting in a conflict of interest between different functions since the ECB will be responsible for supplying liquidity to the banks it is policing and because it will need to be politically accountable in supervising the banks while politically independent in setting monetary policy.</p> <p>\"Accountability is a potential problem,\" said Daniel Gros, a German economist who heads the Centre for European Policy Studies. \"You want the ECB independent of political pressure but to be accountable on banking supervision. How to square that circle?\"</p> <p>Asmussen is the first to agree and is calling for a \"Chinese wall\" to be erected at the ECB to avoid any overlap, conflict, or confusion.</p> <p>\"Monetary policy by definition is independent. Banking supervision by its very nature is not. It must be subject to parliamentary and judicial control. We're open to this request to show accountability to the European parliament and the council [of eurozone governments]. Accountability is needed. In the end it's about taxpayers money and this is the core competence of any parliament.\"</p> <p>Draghi has already shown himself to be much bolder than his predecessor, facing down the might of the Bundesbank \u2014 apparently with a wink and a nod from Berlin \u2014 and taking on a much more political role, always the aim of the French for the ECB and always resisted by the Germans.</p> <p>\"This is uncharted territory,\" said a senior EU official. \"Draghi is taking risks with his own authority. He's getting away with it because of the leadership vacuum he's stepping into. But this can't last. We know that the politicians will have to come back one day.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Frances O'Grady: 'The worry is we've heard this before'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395994826\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/7/25/1343230313175/FrancesOGrady.jpg\" alt=\"Frances O'Grady\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Brendan Barber's keynote speech to the TUC said that policymakers should learn the economic lessons of the Olympics: government can pick winners, invest and plan for growth. So <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/news/topstories/2012/Sep/cable-outlines-vision-for-future-british-industry\" title=\"\">today's speech</a> from the business secretary, Vince Cable, is certainly welcome. Unlike some members of the coalition he understands that, to generate growth and drive up living standards, there is a lot more that government can do than simply getting out of the way.</p> <p>Cable is right that Britain needs a modern industrial policy, something neglected by governments in Britain for much of the last 30 years. His comments on supporting key sectors and reforming procurement rules are steps in the right direction. By setting a strategic direction and using its power as the biggest actor in the economy to support British business, the state can help to shape the direction of the economy.</p> <p>But the worry is that we've heard this before. The business secretary is right to be looking at the case for a British business bank, but his proposals lack detail and may just amount to a rebranding of some existing programmes. The government has been talking about a growth plan for two years; it's time they got on with it. We need to build a new economy, one that is balanced, sustainable and works for ordinary people. Achieving that will mean an active role for government.</p> <p>And while Vince Cable may be moving in the right direction, business does not simply face credit problems. It needs confident public and private customers, and that's up to the chancellor.</p> <p>\u2022 Frances O'Grady is the TUC's general secretary elect</p> <h2>Aditya Chakrabortty: 'Today's speech is full of holes'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395994827\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/6/8/1307529997306/Aditya-Chakrabortty.jpg\" alt=\"Aditya\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>For most of the past three decades, the merest suggestion of the need for a British industrial strategy would get you rubbished by politicians of all main parties. The result has been to leave Britain occupying a disastrous niche: we are the only major economy not to have an industrial strategy; the only G8 country not to have a national investment institution (yes, that includes the US) and now virtually the only advanced economy not to have a serious regional development policy.It's against that background that we should read today's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/11/vince-cable-laissez-faire-work?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">speech by Vince Cable</a>. As I've been asked to keep it brief, I'll make three brief points.</p> <p>1. It's big. Here you have a cabinet minister who just a few years ago wanted to scrap the DTI, now in charge of its successor department \u2013 and taking his first steps towards establishing an industrial strategy. This is a major advance \u2013 especially in the context of a Conservative-led coalition that has spent most of the past couple of years thinking that the way to encourage businesses was to blah on about \"attitude\" and the need to cut red tape.</p> <p>2. It's not big enough. Today's speech is full of holes; the government admits as much. How much money might any of this cost \u2014 and where will it come from? Which sectors do the coalition think are worth developing and why? Cable is very weak here, using catch-alls like \"advanced manufacturing and \"knowledge-intensive services\". And, the biggest question of all, what is an industrial policy for? I would say that one of the highest priorities of any such strategy ought to be creating good new jobs, but Cable's speech made scant reference to employment.</p> <p>3. Other nations are thinking bigger. Spain has picked out key sectors to develop to rebuild itself after the housing crash. Japan has done that \u2014 and been thinking about how to direct monetary policy to these new industries. One of the things that helped the SNP take Holyrood at the last elections was its rhetoric about how to reorient the North Sea oil industry towards developing green energy. But from Westminster, we have an interesting speech delivered over lunch that highlights some intriguing new policy directions \u2013 and possible lines of conflict within the coalition. It's nowhere near enough.</p> <p>Look, I don't know want to knock today's announcement: it's sunny out, and I respect Vince Cable and his team. Besides, a serious consideration of the need for an industrial strategy is to be encouraged. But all this timid step shows is the vastness of the ground Britain has to make up.</p> <p>\u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty is the Guardian's economics leader writer</p> <h2>John Cridland: 'We need a renewed emphasis on specific sectors'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395994828\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/10/3/1317635739600/John-Cridland-003.jpg\" alt=\"John Cridland\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">  Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Vince Cable says he's planning a government-backed bank to increase lending to businesses. When it comes to business lending at affordable rates, the Government has already launched myriad financial initiatives, including <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/aug/01/funding-for-lending-scheme-scepticism\" title=\"\">Funding for Lending</a>. For smaller firms, these have been hard to penetrate, which is why the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) recommends a \"one-stop shop\" to make the whole process easier.</p> <p>I'm not convinced we need a state business bank on the high street, but the Government can add to what banks do.

  "<p>For 11 years, Americans have remembered the victims of the 9/11 attacks in a series of memorials and ceremonies whose rituals have become familiar.</p> <p>But something seems to have changed this year.</p> <p>Some news organizations are taking steps to scale down their coverage of the 9/11 anniversary.</p> <p>\"The pain, the outrage, the loss \u2013 these never fade. The amount of journalism, however, must,\" New York Times <a href=\"http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/11/how-to-cover-the-11th-anniversary-of-911/\">public editor Margaret Sullivan wrote</a> in a Tuesday post about the paper's decision to bump a 9/11 anniversary mention from the front page. The Times wasn't the only paper to make the editorial call: the Wall Street Journal's <a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/188013/911-anniversary-forgotten-on-the-front-page-of-todays-new-york-times/\">only reference appeared as an ad</a>, Poynter notes.</p> <p>Memorials are simplifying, too: for the first time, <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444554704577644053333702124.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_MIDDLENexttoWhatsNewsForth\">no elected officials</a> will speak at the New York site.</p> <p>Still, conversations about 9/11 continue. People still take time to share where they were, how they felt, and what they remember most. But perhaps, like many other national tragedies \u2013 the civil war, JFK, Pearl Harbor \u2013 the memories will eventually become less fresh.</p> <p>So, we're turning this discussion over to you.

Listen here<br></a><br><strong>Hometown:</strong> New York.</p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Michael Quattlebaum (voice).</p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> Mykki Blanco is the \"teenage female rapper\" alter ego of 25-year-old New York poet, actor and author Michael Quattlebaum. Like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/may/02/new-band-le1f\" title=\"\">Le1f</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/24/new-band-zebra-katz\" title=\"\">Zebra Katz</a> he uses producers to fashion a sound inspired presumably by his lyrics. It's hard to tell where Quattlebaum ends and Blanco begins: (s)he describes himself as transgender, with the fluidity that suggests, but seeing as he is still known formally as Michael we'll refer to him from hereon in as \"he\". There are allusions on his forthcoming single Wavvy to his sexual orientation, and it seems legitimate to address the fact that he is gay, even though there are some already who raised concerns that in this identification of a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jun/09/zebra-katz-rise-of-gay-rappers\" title=\"\">strand of the culture</a>, we are guilty of boxing the various artists into a corner.</p> <p>The first thing worth pointing out about Blanco's music is how it's actually not even in the same smeary, hazy ballpark as the current wave of trippy, narcotically sugary hip-hop that has, of late, been used to signal the softening or \"gay-ification\" of hip-hop by A$AP Rocky et al. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aW_QYpjlpSw\" title=\"\">Head Is a Stone</a>, all voice, clatter and echo, sounds more like industrial metal, or the dogmatic, apocalyptic rock of a 21st-century Doors. And that isn't rapping, it's tweaked/treated cyber testifying, with Blanco in the video coming across not as a junior Minaj but some kind of freak cross between Diamanda Galas and Marilyn Manson. Wavvy is totally different: raw, minimal electro over which he doesn't so much subvert rap bravado as just use it \u2013 the intent is the same (the annihilation of the competition), so does it mean something different to the usual ubermensch bragging? On Join My Militia (Nas Gave Me a Perm), Blanco's \"flow\" is a bit Minaj, but the music is something else: a single blurred, murky keyboard note and a smudged, smothering sound.</p> <p>This isn't, however, the exquisite ethereality of a Clams Casino production: it's colder and more alienating than that. Betty Rubble (I Got the Midas Touch) is even more sci-fi and strange, all eerie bloops and vast acres of dub space, Blanco's voice pitch-shifted to sound like a possessed gremlin. These are future-poetical ravings over disconcerting synthesiser music reminiscent of the earliest, creepiest <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6lFNP5yGWk\" title=\"\">Human League</a>. It's rap, Jim, but not as we know it. And our belief isn't that Blanco is being stereotyped or treated as a member of a novelty group, rather that it's him that's doing the holidaying, in the world of hip-hop, and soon he'll be somewhere else, in performance art or acting.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Seeing Blanco perform leaves one feeling mesmerised as though they've been introduced to something unbelievably out-of-this-world while his bravado evokes a mysterious, intriguing sense of optimism\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.vogue.it/en/vogue-starscelebsmodels/focus-on/2012/03/michael-david-quattlebaum-jr-\" title=\"\">Vogue</a>.</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> Hip-hop is his entree into the wider world of entertainment.</p> <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Join the anti-journalist militia.</p> <p><strong>Least likely to:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f49ELXpzyHE\" title=\"\">Blow our mind</a>.</p> <p><strong>What to buy:</strong> Wavvy is self-released on 24 September.</p> <p><strong>File next to:</strong> Zebra Katz, Le1f, Nicki Minaj, Big Freedia.</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/mykkiblanco\" title=\"\">facebook.com/mykkiblanco</a>.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday's new band:</strong> Blacks&amp;.</p>",
  "<p>Penalties for growing and selling cannabis must be toughened because a surge in the trade is driving up shootings and gang-related violence, a senior police officer has warned.</p> <p>Assistant Chief Constable Andy Ward of Merseyside police, who chairs the <a href=\"http://www.titanrocu.org.uk/\" title=\"\">North West Regional Organised Crime Unit</a>, says the punishments for those caught cultivating and dealing in cannabis are not a deterrent and the drug is now causing greater problems for police than class As.</p> <p>According to Ward, an \"explosion\" in cannabis production has resulted in bitter struggles between rival gangs keen to exploit the ease by which cannabis can be manufactured and what they regard as easy money. Shootings in Merseyside have soared by a third since April and officers believe their experience is mirrored across the regions.</p> <p>Ward, who also heads the force's elite Matrix unit that works to combat drug and gun crime, said: \"A lot of these shootings are linked to activity around cannabis.</p> <p>\"We are seeing big increases in cannabis production on Merseyside. Individual groups are fighting turf wars \u2026 We have huge issues around cannabis.\"</p> <p>Over the past three years, more than 5,120 cannabis factories containing in excess of 345,000 plants with an estimated annual yield of \u00a3560m have been discovered across north-west England.</p> <p>In March, a month-long operation involving officers from six forces targeting cannabis farming resulted in the seizure of cannabis with a street value of nearly \u00a39m. In Merseyside alone, police arrested 147 people over the four-week period.</p> <p>Ward said: \"There has been an explosion in the market for cannabis. Unlike class A drugs, which the criminals can't make themselves, there is the opportunity to grow cannabis in the bathrooms or bedrooms of houses. They can make a lot of money very quickly at less risk [to themselves] and less risk in terms of sentencing.</p> <p>\"Criminals who have previously been involved in something else are drifting into the cannabis world \u2026 The amount of money being made by criminals should be reflected in the sentencing.\"</p> <p>While the maximum terms for cultivating and supplying cannabis are not dissimilar to equivalent offences involving class A drugs, in practice the sentencing lengths differ vastly. For instance, in May last year, <a href=\"http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2011/05/24/widnes-businessman-jailed-for-2m-cannabis-factory-hidden-in-barn-100252-28749324/\" title=\"\">Stuart Thompson was jailed for 15 months</a> after allowing a \u00a32m-a-year cannabis factory to be set up in a barn he owned near Widnes. Alan and Ian Farley, two Liverpool brothers who were part of a \u00a32m heroin operation, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-12196151\" title=\"\">were each sentenced to 14 years in January 2011</a>.</p> <p>Five years after 11-year-old Rhys Jones was shot on his way home from football practice, shootings and gang-related activity account for a small proportion of crime on Merseyside. But, as Ward himself admits, the impact on people's lives and local communities is huge.</p> <p>Residents in Norris Green, Liverpool, have first-hand experience of the devastating consequences of gun crime. In the early hours of 13 June, Joseph Thompson, 32, was shot and killed opposite Scargreen sports ground.</p> <p>One woman who has lived in the area for 32 years described how Thompson died outside her front gate. \"It was late and I thought I heard someone knocking on the door so I went to see.</p> <p>\"I opened the door and a man was falling to his knees. Someone said I should call an ambulance so I did. I heard someone shout 'He's dead, he's dead'.</p> <p>\"The ambulance hadn't turned up so I called again. The police turned up and said the ambulance was on its way. The man was just lying there. After a couple of hours they put a blanket over him. By 5am they had erected a tent.\"</p> <p>The woman, who wished to remain anonymous, said it was frightening: \"I couldn't leave my house for two days because the forensics were doing their work. I feel like I'm walking over his grave every time I go out my front door.\"</p> <p>Three men have been arrested and bailed over the shooting of Thompson. But his death has had seemingly little impact on gun violence.</p> <p>Less than two months after Thompson was killed, four teenagers in Bootle received treatment for shotgun injuries. The violence, believed to be part of a feud between two rival gangs, was the fifth shooting in the area in just over a week.</p> <p>Last week, four people were arrested after shots were fired in the back yard of a Liverpool house. After the shooting in Tuebrook, central Liverpool, a man was admitted to hospital with a gunshot wound to his arm. At the weekend, another man was shot in the back in Toxteth.</p> <p>In total, there have been 68 firearms discharges in Merseyside since the beginning of April. But the statistics do not tell the whole story. While some troubled districts embody the 1980s stereotype of a broken society \u2013 rusted supermarket trolleys, boarded-up terraces, abundant litter \u2013 community leaders believe there are reasons to be optimistic.</p> <p>Lee Donafee is the network director for the Merseyside Inclusion Network and runs the Croxteth Gems, a centre that helps young people realise they have an alternative to a life of crime.</p> <p>\"I know for a fact we are making headway because of how popular the centre is,\" Donafee said. \"We guide and support the kids. It's been hard, I was funding it myself at first, but last year it really took off. The kids say it's easy money to go round selling drugs. We make them aware of what can happen if they follow the wrong path.\"</p> <p>Michael Waldock, 16, has been coming to the centre for the past two years. \"Coming here brings new opportunities, we go out to places and we can get jobs and work through the centre,\" he said. \"If I wasn't here, I'd be sitting on the street, walking around not doing much at all.\"</p> <p>Despite the rise in gang-related violence, Merseyside police says things can improve.

The impact of that law reform had wide social consequences and Allan can be seen as one of the founders of both the gay movement and the gay community.</p> <p>Born in the Lancashire village of Laneshaw Bridge, Allan was brought up by his grandparents whom he described as \"god-fearing Conservatives and fervent upholders of law and order\". He met other gay men during three years in the RAF but rather than move to the anonymity of a city he returned to his home county to work for the National Coal Board. Small-town gay life was very secretive and when, after the publication of the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/4/newsid_3007000/3007686.stm\" title=\"\">Wolfenden Report in 1957</a>, Allan became involved in the politics of law reform, several gay acquaintances warned him of the dangers of rocking the boat.</p> <p>He became a member of the Labour party at the time of the Suez crisis and many members were of the view that homosexuality was not an issue for the working class. Allan became associated with the London-based Homosexual Law Reform Society in 1958 and was one of the founding members of the North West Committee for Homosexual Law Reform in 1964. In an act of enormous political bravery, he used his home address in the mining community of Atherton as the contact point for the organisation. He also took the controversial view that homosexual supporters should not have to conceal their sexuality for the sake of the cause of law reform.</p> <p>After years of campaigning and public meetings, the law was changedand Allan and others set up the <a href=\"http://www.c-h-e.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Campaign for Homosexual Equality (CHE)</a>, much to the distaste of some of their parliamentary supporters. He eventually became president of CHE and, though he always remained politically active, his role in the removal of the stigma of criminality from homosexuality remained his crowning achievement.</p> <p>In recent years, a younger generation became inspired by his story and he spoke about the travails of campaigning in the 1960s at events organised by groups such as LGBT History Month and Manchester Trades Council. In 2009 he was interviewed for the Millthorpe oral history project; the recording can be accessed at the Sound Archive of the British Library.</p> <p>Allan's partner, Harold Pollard, died in 1996.</p>",
  "<p>It was supposed to be one of the smaller but more immediate legacies of London 2012: an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/11/olympic-games-water-chariots-london\" title=\"\">Olympic and Paralympic passenger boat service along east London's river Lea</a> which, once the Games were over, would evolve into a popular leisure business over the course of its 15-year contract.</p> <p>Instead, the company which was awarded the exclusive deal \u2013 and then <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-18050472\" title=\"\">attracted savage criticism</a> for charging up to \u00a395 for a ticket \u2013 has seemingly gone bust before London 2012 even finished.</p> <p>Water Chariots boasted it would offer up to 120 return trips a day to the Olympic Park from its newly-renovated base at Limehouse Basin marina, south of the venue by the Thames, and from Tottenham Hale to the north, using a fleet of 15 specially-built vessels. One of these, the archly-titled Usain Boat, had its name plate unveiled by Prince Charles in his role as patron of the Canal and River Trust, the charity which is one of the successors to British Waterways, which awarded the contract.</p> <p>With its own entrance to the Olympic Park, the company marketed itself as the only guaranteed way to reach the Games on time and marketed the service as a premium product, complete with jazz bands and a complimentary glass of champagne. But return tickets costing \u00a395 for adults and \u00a350 for children, plus the lack of the predicted transport chaos elsewhere, saw boats reportedly sail half empty, and prices were soon slashed. A week ago, halfway through the Paralympics, the <a href=\"http://www.water-chariots.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Water Chariots website said</a> the company had stopped taking bookings \"due to events beyond our control\". Some websites <a href=\"http://www.narrowboatworld.com/index.php/news-flash/4820-warningtwo-chariots\" title=\"\">reported that staff had not been paid</a>.</p> <p>Before the Games the Canal and River Trust said it had no input into Water Chariots' pricing or view about it, but that the company was handed the monopoly to run the service \"as they presented a sound business plan that had significant legacy value\". This planned legacy would see some of the 80-passenger boats converted into self-hire vessels based at Limehouse, with others still used for general transport. The hope was this would help promote further investment in an area which faces serious economic deprivation.</p> <p>A Canal and River Trust spokeswoman said she did not know definitively whether Water Chariots had gone bust. She said: \"We've had discussions with them, but we're not privy to their business decisions. We're aware they've stopped operating the service.\"</p> <p>The trust awarded the company a six-month Games-based contract to run passenger services until October. The wider 15-year contract, to use the moorings at Limehouse Basin, was with <a href=\"http://www.bwml.co.uk/\" title=\"\">British Waterways Marinas Ltd</a> (BWML), a private company which operates moorings for the Canal and River Trust. A spokesman for BWML said it knew Water Chariots had gone out of business but little beyond that. He said: \"We're waiting for notification from the administrator. We know there's an administrator that's been put into place, but other than that we're waiting for information.\"</p> <p>The renovation of the Limehouse marina before its use by Water Chariots had been entirely financed by BWML, he added, with no public funding. The company was confident it would not lose out over Water Chariots' demise, given the \"very high demand\" for moorings in the area, for both commercial and residential use. He said: \"To be honest with you, we can sell those moorings whether Water Chariots are on them or not. We were putting some investment into the site in any case.\"</p> <p>Water Chariots, run by Peter Coleman, a property developer, could not be reached for comment. The PR company which represented it ahead of the Olympics said it no longer worked for the company.</p>",
  "<p>Marketers clearly understand the need to create an affinity between brands and people, but their method is misdirected. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2012/mar/23/mind-control-advent-of-neuroscience?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Neuroscience has shown that behavioural mirroring is where real empathy happens</a>, yet marketers' obsession with such things as Facebook \"likes\" could not be more out of sync with the concept of mirroring.</p> <p>Here are ten new behaviours you can adopt to achieve greater affinity and a more meaningful collaboration between departments, partners and consumers:</p> <h2>1. Avoid the big data crush</h2> <p>Instead of holding out hope for the promise of big data, which according to McKinsey we currently lack the skills to interpret, embrace the concept of intuition and use what data you can interpret to test your hunches.</p> <h2>2. Capitalise on digital's malleability</h2> <p>The ease and speed with which products, platforms and services can be created, launched and improved through strong feedback mechanisms makes digital one of the most malleable forms of prototyping available.</p> <h2>3. See the consumer through new eyes</h2> <p>Start every engagement with questions about consumer behaviour. Challenge yourself to think about what behaviours you want to affect and what behaviours you can play to. These questions will better serve you than the elusive search for an insight.</p> <h2>4. Borrow existing behaviours</h2> <p>When thinking about your brand and its interaction with consumers, look to the behaviours people already exhibit through their current brand interactions and see what can be borrowed.</p> <h2>5. Make what already exists more useful</h2> <p>When it comes to innovation, think about making the stuff you own more useful rather than always trying to make more stuff. Look for relationships across business verticals that, when combined, could create a new proposition for people.</p> <h2>6. Eliminate the distance between product creation and marketing</h2> <p>Consumers are having a greater influence in the development of new products and the advancement of existing products, so for marketing to be effective it has to start side by side with the product guys.</p> <h2>7. Put communication partners at the centre</h2> <p>Bring your communication partners into the centre of your product/marketing ecosystem \u2013 they bring lateral thinking and a perspective that lives outside of the day-to-day business, which is probably closer to that of your consumer.</p> <h2>8. Fix your agency partners' dysfunctions</h2> <p>If meetings with your communication partners are often overcrowded and unproductive, you clearly have a level of dysfunction within your partner ecosystem. Get your partners to work in small multidisciplinary teams, where everyone in the meeting has an active role in delivering on the brief.</p> <h2>9. Develop frameworks, not processes, to achieve more innovative solutions</h2> <p>Set processes are something your teams lean against while frameworks provide your teams with something to lean into. The introduction of principles and values \u2013 the ingredients of a strong framework \u2013 enable a reduction in the reliance on processes. This results in increased creativity, increased ownership, and fresh ideas.</p> <h2>10. Be courageously patient</h2> <p>Changing set ways of doing things will create anxiety among those who lean on routine, but will excite those who thrive on being in sync with the new behavioural dynamics of the consumer. Both parties are likely to be critical to your business, so it will be down to you to decide on the pace of change that respects the human dynamics of your employees.</p> <p><em>Alasdair Lloyd-Jones is COO of </em><a href=\"http://www.bigspaceship.com\" title=\"\"><em>Big Spaceship</em></a><em> \u2013 this comment will form part of the SoDA report Digital Marketing Outlook Volume II</em></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/media-network/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> to the </strong><a href=\"http://theguardian.com/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

  "<h2>THE RETURN OF NORMALITY, IF NOT THE PREMIER LEAGUE QUITE YET</h2> <p>There were amazing scenes on the streets of London yesterday, as the nation paid its respects to everyone involved in the Olympic and Paralympic Games. It was a spectacular carnival celebrating a month during which Great Britain excelled at disciplines such as the Heptathlon, the Road Race C4-5, the 5,000 Metres, the Discus F51/52/53, the Lightweight Double Sculls, the Passive Aggressive Jingoistic Smug Reacharound, the Watching Sport Every Four Years And Spotting Something Achingly Obvious Then Telling People Who Watch Sport All The Time The Achingly Obvious Thing They've Just Spotted In A Confident Manner Bordering On Outright Braying Which Clearly Suggests They Consider People Who Watch Sport All The Time To Have Severe Cognitive Difficulties, and the Dressage.</p> <p>But that's all over now, and Britain can go back to concentrating on the pastimes we're normally interested in. Stuff like tennis, internet trolling and football. Andy Murray winning the US Open last night covers the first two bases, while this evening there are some World Cup qualifiers to further ease us back to normality. The big match, need we tell you, is Scotland versus Macedonia. Now, you can tell the mood Craig Levein is in by the length of his beard, which he squeezes in and out like Play-Doh hair. A full, wild fungus means he's up for a rammy. Severe stubble suggests he's up for a rammy. Somewhere in between and guess what?</p> <p>That's right, and apparently it's \"nonsense\" that Scotland's qualification is in the balance after the draw against Serbia last weekend, a match which saw Levein once again controversially name an XI without a striker by selecting Kenny Miller. \"Come the end of the tournament, the point against Serbia might be the one that makes all the difference,\" he growled, without going on to mention the two dropped that might make an even bigger difference, two points that were on offer to anyone brave enough to give Jordan Rhodes more than 0.00035876 seconds of game time.</p> <p>Serbia are meanwhile back home in Novi Sad, where they face Wales, whose biggest worry is ostensibly the fitness of Joe Allen, but actually should be Chris Coleman's slightly less than proactive managerial masterplan. \"We're going to score and we're going to win, sooner or later that's going to happen,\" he yawned, swinging his feet up on the desk. \"People say you're only as good as your worst game. Nonsense, that doesn't make sense. You're as good as your best game, because that's the level you've shown. Somehow.\" Glad that's sorted out, then.</p> <p>Norn Iron 1-0 fans are likely to be in much less of a panic than their Welsh brethren, as their lads are only playing tiny Luxembourg, who are... hold on, they're 23 places higher than the Iron in the Fifa rankings! When did that happen? Oh. Oh dear. Moving swiftly on, then, and finally there's England, who will face Ukraine with the cast that starred in Moldova minus virus victim Theo Walcott, and who we mention only briefly in a pathetically transparent ploy to annoy grown adults who should know better but nevertheless get jolly het up about such things.</p> <p>And finally, in this weekend's Global Champions Tour showjumping, Nick Skelton and Michael Whitaker are hoping to make up ground on Australian rider Edwina Tops-Alexander who has been leading the event since April, when she ... hey, where have all the Watching Sport Every Four Years People gone?</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football\" title=\"\"><em>Follow England 2-0 Ukraine with Scott Murray's minute-by-minute report and all the other matches we can't be bothered incorrectly predicting the scores of for precious little comic effect with John Ashdown's clockwatch from 7pm</em></a></p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\"There's a bit of a media spotlight on me so if we go down, I'm going to take a lot of s**t.

  "<p>When Sir Peter Bazalgette, the man who brought Big Brother to the UK, was appointed chairman of Arts Council England, the level of opprobrium from some quarters was entirely predictable. \"It is very worrying that someone who has dumbed down, trivialised and sexualised mass TV viewing with Big Brother has been put in charge of British culture,\" Labour MP Denis MacShane told Bazalgette's most relentless critic, the Daily Mail.</p> <p>It was the Mail's Quentin Letts, Bazalgette's tormentor-in-chief, who named him one of the \"10 worst Britons\", and dubbed him a \"brutal populist\" and \"buttery schmoozer\" who \"throws champagne parties at his \u00a310m house\" in Notting Hill. Bazalgette \u2013 or \"Baz\" as he is known to friends and colleagues \u2013 does indeed throw a memorable summer party in the gardens of his west London home. \"It is probably the best group of media people you will get to meet, very eclectic but powerful,\" says venture capitalist Luke Johnson, chairman of Channel 4 when Bazalgette, 59, was one of its non-executive directors.</p> <p>Where else could you meet Mark Thompson, outgoing director general of the BBC, and celebrity chef Ainsley Harriott, star of one of Bazalgette's earlier TV hits, over the canapes?</p> <p>\"He's a sort of renaissance man because not only has he been a great programme-maker and entrepreneur,\" adds Johnson. \"He's written books, and he writes a food column for the FT. He's a fabulous networker, he's great company and \u2013 let's face it \u2013 he's ambitious.\"</p> <p>In a 30-year television career, Bazalgette's list of credits extend beyond Big Brother. He was also responsible for the rise of programmes such as Ready Steady Cook, Changing Rooms and Ground Force which became global hits in the 1990s and would help make Bazalgette his fortune. The chattering classes looked down on those too. \"He believed if something was popular then it was probably good,\" says Tim Hincks, president of Endemol Group, producer of Big Brother, who worked with Bazalgette for many years. \"He enjoys controversy, he certainly likes a debate.\"</p> <p>Knighted for services to television earlier this year, he will succeed Dame Liz Forgan \u2013 who also chairs the Scott Trust, owner of the Guardian \u2013 as chair of Arts Council England in February next year. He takes over at a critical time. The patron of 690 arts bodies across England and with \u00a31.4bn to disburse, along with \u00a3850m from the National Lottery, has already suffered a near 30% cut in grants and faces the prospect of further cuts in 2015. The council is also in the process of slashing the amount of money it spends on its own administration from 11% of its total budget to 3.5%. \"It's a very nervous time internally,\" says one insider.</p> <p>Bazalgette is familiar with the challenges of funding the arts. He is a long-time board member and deputy chairman of the English National Opera, and was appointed its chairman in June. He has also served as a non-executive director at the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), giving him a glimpse, when it comes to the next round of funding negotiations, over both sides of the fence.</p> <p>\"It is going to be another really tough spending round, and he needs to find the right arguments to convince the government that quite a small amount of spending on arts and culture brings phenomenally great rewards,\" says Tony Hall, chief executive of the Royal Opera House. \"We have to demonstrate that we are doing absolutely everything we can to bring money into the arts, but we still need support, especially outside of London. Having someone of Peter's background making those arguments will be really powerful.\"</p> <p>The great-great grandson of Sir Joseph Bazalgette, who built London's Victorian sewer system, Bazalgette was born in London in 1953 and went to Dulwich College in south-east London, where his contemporaries included Financial Times editor Lionel Barber, and then to Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, where he become president of Cambridge Union. His university friend John Makinson, chairman of Penguin and the National Theatre, remembers him as a \"superstar of the union. His trademark qualities are that he manages to be both irreverent and self-deprecating on the one hand, and yet serious and thoughtful on the other, all features that were well in evidence in his Cambridge days\".</p> <p>He is variously described as \"fantastic fun and thoroughly approachable, with a mischievous twinkle in his eye\", but with an occasional tendency to nod off in meetings. Linked to various of the big broadcasting jobs over the last decade, he came closest in 2002 when he was in the running to be chief executive of Channel 4, only to pull out at the last minute. Channel 4's Johnson discussed the same role with him two years later.</p> <p>\"I think he took the view that it was too much grief,\" remembers Johnson. \"He had the entrepreneurial bug and was more interested in pursuing a range of different things.\"</p> <p>Johnson also has a warning: \"He may find chairing the Arts Council constraining. I am sure he is up to the task but he won't necessarily find it what he has been used to in recent times.\"</p> <p>Sir Nicholas Kenyon, managing director of the Barbican Centre and, like Bazalgette, a member of the ENO board, describes him as \"absolutely the right man for what is a very difficult job\".</p> <p>\"The fact that Baz has been on the board of the DCMS will ensure there is continuity of thinking. The challenge will be how far he is prepared to criticise and distance himself from it; he does not want to be seen as an agent of the DCMS as chairman of the Arts Council.\"</p> <p>Kenyon is quick to praise the marketing and digital nous that Bazalgette brought to ENO, and the new Arts Council chief is understood to be particularly keen on highlighting the commercial and cultural payback from state sponsorship of the arts. Both Stephen Daldry, head of the Olympics ceremonies, and Danny Boyle, who directed the acclaimed opening spectacular to the London Games, had their breaks in state-subsidised theatre (Daldry at the Sheffield Crucible, Boyle at the Royal Court Theatre).</p> <p>Former ENO board member Janis Susskind, who stepped down in July, describes him as \"thoughtful and energetic\". She says: \"It is better that he has seen from the inside what the challenges are in a major arts organisation rather than being some abstract theorist coming in from the outside.\"</p> <p>Emerging from university with a third in law \u2013 possibly as a result of spending too much time writing the student newspaper gossip column \u2013 Bazalgette has joked that he had no option but to pursue a career in the media. He joined the BBC as a news trainee and was spotted by Esther Rantzen, who hired him to work as a researcher on That's Life. Bazalgette later said that he learned all he knew \"at Esther's knee&#xa0;\u2026 it's all about informing and entertaining\". He went on to produce BBC2's Food and Drink and set up his own company, Bazal, in 1987, which was sold to Dutch company Endemol three years later. He rose to become its creative director in 1998, stepping down from the company nearly a decade later.</p> <p>Although he did not create Big Brother, he was closely involved in its UK incarnation which debuted on Channel 4 in 2000. It has been sullied by a string of controversies, including racism rows and an episode of on-screen violence which prompted viewers to call the police, but the first series was genuinely groundbreaking, not least for its use of streamed video on the internet. Axed by Channel 4, it has since been picked up by Channel 5.</p> <p>Estimates of a seven-figure salary at Endemol are said to be over-inflated, but he did enjoy a bonus payout worth several million pounds during his time with the company, and enjoyed a further windfall when it was sold to Telef\u00f3nica in 2000. He is certainly not doing his new job, which pays \u00a340,000 for a two-day week, for the money.</p> <p>Married with two children, he has earned enough to have two holiday homes, one in Tuscany and one on the south Devon coast, and his official Debrett's biography lists \"gluttony\" among his recreations. He is also a cricket fanatic \u2013 a colleague once said that he only hired him because he needed a wicketkeeper for his team.</p> <p>Bazalgette consistently refuses to be drawn on his politics. The most anyone has got out of him was that he has voted for different parties. He was briefly involved with a Conservative party commission on reviving popular interest in the democratic process, but stepped down when it became too high-profile.\"He is interested in the political process and how government works, rather than having political ambitions in any obvious way,\" says Makinson. \"He has very strong views on the BBC and Channel 4, and is interested in those organisations which sit on the boundary of private and public sector. He is very comfortable patrolling those boundaries. That's where [the Arts Council role] sits and I think he will be very good at it.\" Bazalgette was also on the advisory board of The Space, a digital joint venture between the BBC and the Arts Council that played host to new arts projects as well as archive material such as John Peel's record collection.</p> <p>It had echoes of an idea Bazalgette floated four years ago for a new platform to showcase content from arts institutions, museums and galleries, if not the way it is funded \u2013 which, he suggested, could include the sale of Radios 1 and 2.</p> <p>Roly Keating, the BBC's former director of archive content, and now chief executive of the British Library, who was closely involved in setting up The Space, says: \"I was a huge fan of Liz Forgan. But if Liz is to leave, then in Baz they have found someone very different but of equal calibre and charisma.</p> <p>\"What Baz has is a zest for life and people and restless curiosity that made him a very good TV producer. Behind that sometimes sardonic facade is a very sharp brain at work.\"</p> <h2>Curriculum vitae</h2> <p><strong>Born:</strong> 22 May 1953</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 59</p> <p><strong>Career:</strong> A TV producer and entrepreneur credited with helping to invent reality TV, Bazalgette created television shows including Ready Steady Cook, Changing Rooms and became creative director of Endemol, the company behind Big Brother and Deal or No Deal</p> <p><strong>High point:</strong> Launching Big Brother in the UK in 2000, after which he was routinely held responsible for everything that was good or bad about TV entertainment.

  "<p>A charity is likely to have to move from the high street that it helped to win extra government cash to regenerate. Bath Place Community Venture (BPCV), which was the community lead partner in the bid for Leamington Spa to became a \"Portas pilot\" and win \u00a3100,000 to improve its old town, is being forced to vacate its premises in the heart of the rundown area to make way for the development of luxury flats.</p> <p>Leamington Spa was one of 15 town centres awarded funding in July, following a review by television presenter and government retail adviser, Mary Portas, of how to revitalise troubled high streets. Some of the buildings in the old town have been empty for more than 20 years, and the focal point of the area is a grimy, disused railway bridge.</p> <p>Bill Hunt, deputy chief executive at Warwick district council, who worked closely with the Leamington Spa team that developed the bid, says: \"Bath Place Community Venture is an integral part of that team. But clearly there is a significant concern as to its future viability as an organisation, given its need to leave their current premises.\"</p> <p>BPCV sees more than 500 visitors a &#xa0;week at the Old Library, which provides support and facilities for 40 community organisations, including Springfield Mind, Warwickshire probation service and the Leamington community kitchen, which provides free meals each Sunday.</p> <p>Warwickshire College, which owns the Old Library, offered the facilities rent-free after BPCV's previous home was destroyed in a fire in 2009.</p> <p>\"[BPCV's] use was always understood to be a temporary 'stopgap' measure,\" says Chris Paget, executive director for asset development at Warwickshire College. He&#xa0;adds that the college needs to raise funds for \"essential investment\" in its \"ageing buildings\" at its Leamington Spa site.</p> <p>Tag Exclusive Properties has submitted a planning application to convert the Old Library to 28 residential apartments. BPCV says it would have used the building to create a community hub to offer space to other charities and provide services focused on learning new job skills.</p> <p>Chris Barrow, BPCV manager, says had the charity's lease been extended until legislation supporting the Localism Act was put in place later this year, then BPCV could have used the new Community Right to Bid clause to express interest in purchasing the building. If successful, it would have been given a few months in which to raise the necessary funds.</p> <p>Both Warwickshire College and the district council have offered to help BPCV find a new site from which to continue to provide its charitable services. \"We have always supported the Venture,\" says Paget, \"and have offered ongoing help to them in looking for alternative premises and in applying for capital funding in support of their future.\"</p> <p>Hunt adds that the council has offered to find BPCV a council-owned property or approach local landlords on the charity's behalf.</p> <p>BPCV staff are pessimistic as to the likelihood of finding a building that can offer the same opportunities as the Old Library. \"We're looking at alternative premises,\" says Barrow. \"If we can find a new building, a larger building, then we will go for it, but it's unlikely. There's no building like this that could fulfil our wishes.\"</p> <p>Clayton Denwood, BPCV's site manager, says any move will be detrimental to the charity's beneficiaries. \"The important thing is the number of groups that will have no affordable place for their activities or enterprises,\" he says. \"We're costing the taxpayer nothing but need the facilities with which to provide our service.\"</p> <p>More than 1,700 visitors signed a petition to save the Old Library and BPCV, which was circulated earlier this year and has been sent to the district council and local MP Chris White. The petition points to a covenant from 1898 that dictates the Old Library should always remain a public building.</p> <p>One signatory wrote: \"Evicting Bath Place would rip the heart out of a community, uproot so many groups that simply have nowhere else to go, and cause further suffering for those who have already been through enough.\"</p> <p>Despite the imminent upheaval, BPCV still plans to help with the regeneration of the old town. \"Although there is a certain irony that our strong community presence was one of the factors in helping Leamington old town to secure the Mary Portas bid,\" says Barrow, \"we will remain committed to contributing to regenerate this part of the town even after having to leave.\"</p>",
  "<p>There should be little mystery about China's next leader. Xi Jinping is expected to take the helm of the Communist party in a matter of weeks, in the long-awaited, once-a-decade transition of power. Next spring, he is expected to become the country's president.</p> <p>But for 10 days, there has been no sign of the country's heir apparent. His absence from the public eye \u2013 and the lack of any coherent explanation \u2013 has unleashed a storm of bizarre rumours and wild speculation, and raised fresh questions over the secrecy and rigidity of the party system.</p> <p>Xi's last recorded public appearance was on 1 September, and since then he has skipped a string of expected meetings with foreign politicians. Officials have so far stone-walled, telling journalists they have no information about Xi's whereabouts and condition. Other sources have suggested the 59-year-old is suffering from health issues; possibly a bad back or perhaps even a mild heart attack.</p> <p>\"Everybody's looking for him \u2013 I'm looking for him,\" said Bo Zhiyue, an expert on Chinese politics. \"It seems like it's a little bit serious. He's been absent for 10 days without any explanation.\" Xi cancelled meetings with Hillary Clinton and the Singaporean prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, last week. According to a media advisory, he was also due to meet the Danish prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, for a photo opportunity on Monday, although she later said he had never been included in her schedule.</p> <p>His name was also missing from a list of attendees of a meeting of the Central Military Commission, of which he is a vice-chairman. Xi is expected to become general secretary of the Communist party next month, although no date for the party congress has been formally announced.</p> <p>The party hoped this year's leadership transition would be smooth and uneventful, but it has already seen the dramatic toppling of the populist politician Bo Xilai and, more recently, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/03/china-scandal-fatal-ferrari-crash\" title=\"\">reassignment of one of President Hu Jintao's key allies</a> after his son's reported involvement in a fatal Ferrari crash.</p> <p>Jean-Pierre Cabestan, professor of political science at Hong Kong Baptist University, said the silence over Xi's whereabouts \"opens the door to all sorts of rumours, including some pretty incredible ones\".</p> <p>The most outlandish \u2013 since retracted by the US-based Chinese-language site that published it \u2013 suggested he had been hurt in a car crash orchestrated by a military official seeking to injure or kill him.</p> <p>Amid baseless speculation and official silence, one journalist asked a foreign ministry spokesman if he could at least confirm Xi was still alive. \"I hope you can ask a serious question,\" was the reply.</p> <p>Reuters said two unnamed sources had blamed a minor ailment. \"Xi injured his back when he went for his daily swim,\" a source close to the Beijing leadership told the news agency last week, after he cancelled a meeting with Clinton. Another source, citing people close to Xi, said this week: \"He's unwell, but it's not a big problem.\"</p> <p>Analysts say insiders may well have an interest in playing down problems. But they also point out that the health of leaders is a highly sensitive subject in China and that it would be foolish to read too much into the silence of authorities. \"Part of this is standard operating procedure; it's not obfuscation or misdirection as much as it is bureaucratic default,\" said Russell Leigh Moses, a Beijing-based political analyst.</p> <p>In the west, the persistent pressure for officials to explain themselves would result in disclosure. In China, \"I don't think anyone sees a compelling need,\" he said. But as China takes an increasingly central role on the world stage, such an approach is no longer tenable, argued Cabestan. \"For a country like China \u2013 the world's largest by population and its second largest economy \u2013 to keep this degree of opacity in the political process \u2026 I think it's unsustainable.</p> <p>\"In their view it shouldn't be a problem. In our view it is \u2013 and in the eyes of more and more Chinese people who are on the internet and trying to get information that way,\" he said.</p> <p>Online discussion about the leadership is heavily censored in China. Microbloggers on the Sina Weibo service skirted control by referring to Xi as the \"crown prince\", but on Tuesday evening it was no longer possible to search for the words \"back injury\" on the service.</p> <p>Steve Tsang, an expert on Chinese politics at the University of Nottingham, said that while the party's handling of such issues eroded trust and therefore stability rather than protecting them, it would probably continue thanks to habit and vested interests in the bureaucracy.</p> <p>He added: \"It doesn't matter if they tell the truth; no one will believe them anyway. The credibility of the party is so bad that unless people see Xi Jinping is physically well, nobody will believe what they say.\"</p>",

The library closed down by Barnet council in April is under new management.</p> <p>Eight squatters entered the north London library last week through an open window. Since a law change on 1 September made it a criminal offence to squat residential properties, they have turned to commercial properties to find a bed for the night. The occupation has the blessing of many residents who are delighted to see the locked doors of the library flung open once again. It's the first time that squatters have morphed into \"community librarians\" by occupying and reopening a public lending resource in this way. Book loans will be manually recorded and stamped.</p> <p>Council officials have been trying for months to persuade locals enraged by the library closure to become volunteer librarians in a room in a nearby council building instead. The proposal has not been well received: residents want to see their much-loved local library reopened and stalemate has prevailed.</p> <p>All that changed when the squatters moved in and embarked on unprecedented negotiations with senior council officials about the future of the library.</p> <p>To everyone's surprise, instead of starting eviction proceedings immediately the council agreed to a series of meetings with the squatters to discuss ways to provide a new, volunteer-run library. Senior council officials including assistant chief executive Julie Taylor were invited to the library on Monday to meet the new occupants who treated them to tea and cakes. Another meeting has been scheduled for next week.</p> <p>On Tuesday the squatters, who describe themselves as caretakers, are opening for business, lending books for the first time since the council closed the library. While they don't have the knowledge and expertise of trained librarians they have plenty of enthusiasm. They have set up a rota of volunteer librarians so that the library can open four days a week. &gt;</p> <p>The closure of Friern Barnet library is part of a pattern of library closures nationwide. Barnet council is hoping to save money by no longer employing paid staff at the library and plans to sell off the land on which the library sits to a developer within the next six to 18 months. The <a href=\"http://www.publiclibrariesnews.com/\" title=\"\">Public Libraries News website</a> run by librarian Ian Anstice estimates that nationally 270 libraries have closed or are under threat out of a total of 4,612. Bolton, the Isle of Wight and Lewisham in south-east London have been hit hard by the closures and Surrey has approved plans to remove paid staff from 10 libraries and rely on trained volunteers instead. Brent residents are fighting for the right to run Kensal Rise library which the council has closed.</p> <p>While Anstice praises the work that volunteers are doing to keep open local libraries, he warns of the alarming effect this is having nationally. \"All this makes it easier for councils to divest themselves of libraries and it destroys what is already a very fragmented network. We are facing the worst trend in public library provision in peacetime history,\" said Anstice.</p> <p>The libraries minister, Ed Vaizey, has said the government is \"not currently minded\" to prevent library closures in Bolton, the Isle of Wight and Lewisham. The children's laureate, Julia Donaldson, has written an open letter to the new culture secretary, Maria Miller, condemning library closures.</p> <p>Mike Gee, a resident campaigning to reopen Friern Barnet library, backs the squatters for achieving what residents, 7,000 of whom have signed a petition protesting about the closure, have so far failed to do. \"One action is worth 1,000 words,\" he said. \"I fully endorse what the squatters have done but I am concerned about the situation. Does the council pay a librarian to do an honest day's work or does the council chief executive, who is on 10 times a librarian's salary, get volunteers to do the job for free?\"</p> <p>Another resident, Rosa de Souza, said: \"I couldn't believe it when I walked past and saw the library open again. Since it has closed, me and my kids have to get on a bus if we want to borrow a book.\"</p> <p>A Barnet council spokeswoman said: \"We are still continuing conversations with the protesters but at the same time the council has started the legal process to have the occupants removed. No papers have been served as yet but the council has a duty to protect its public assets. At the same time it wants to continue to have these conversations.\" One squatter, Pete Phoenix, said: \"We want to bring back empty buildings into public use and this is a great example of it. I've learnt many skills over the years as a squatter \u2013 roofing, fixing electrics, unblocking toilets; now I can add community librarian to my CV.\"</p>",
  "<p>A detainee at Guant\u00e1namo was found dead in his cell on Saturday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/10/guantanamo-bay-us-military?newsfeed=true\">according to camp officials</a>. He is the ninth person to die at the camp since it was opened more than ten years ago. As former Gitmo guard Brandon Neely <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrandonTXNeely/status/245299643653701633\">pointed out Monday</a>, more detainees have died at the camp (nine) than have been convicted of wrongdoing by its military commissions (<a href=\"http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/our-work/law-and-security/military-commissions/\">six</a>). This is the <a href=\"http://my.firedoglake.com/centerforconstitutionalrights/2012/09/10/ccr-condemns-ninth-shameful-and-tragic-death-at-guantanamo/\">fourth detainee who has died</a> at the camp since Obama's inauguration.</p> <p>Although the detainee's identity has not been disclosed, a camp spokesman acknowledged that he \"had not been charged and had not been designated for prosecution\". In other words, he has been kept by the US government in a cage for many years without any opportunity to contest the accusations against him, and had no hope of leaving the camp except by death.</p> <p>Indeed, dying in due process-free captivity now appears to be the only way for many of these detainees to leave. The last person to leave the camp via death was a 48-year-old Afghan citizen, Awal Gul, who <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/02/04/guantanamo_16/\">died in February 2011</a> of an apparent heart attack. Gul, the father of 18 children, was accused by the US of being a Taliban commander \u2013 a charge he vehemently denied because, as his lawyer <a href=\"http://my.firedoglake.com/phoenix/2011/02/03/awal-gul-you-cannot-wash-blood-with-blood/\">put it</a>, \"he was disgusted by the Taliban's growing penchant for corruption and abuse.\" But the due process-free indefinite detention policy still in place at the camp meant that those conflicting claims were never resolved, and he died after more than nine years in captivity \u2013 thousands of miles from his family, in the middle of a foreign ocean \u2013 despite never having been convicted of anything.</p> <p>In the hierarchy of evil, consigning someone who has been convicted of nothing to a cage year after year after year, until they die, is high up on the list. And in that regard, this latest episode demonstrates not only the ongoing travesty of the US's war on terror policies, but also the dishonesty of the attempt to exonerate Obama for those policies.</p> <p>What has always made Guant\u00e1namo such an assault on basic notions of justice, and what still makes it so, is not its physical location in the Carribean sea. Its defining evil is its system of indefinite detention: that human beings are imprisoned indefinitely, sometimes for life, without the obligation to prove they are guilty of anything. Notwithstanding the authoritarian eagerness on the part of many to blissfully assume that people in Gitmo must be guilty terrorists because the US government says so, punishing people without trials or charges is as tyrannical as it gets, and it continues in full. </p> <p>To the extent they ever address any of this at all any more, Obama defenders love to point out that he tried to fulfill his promise to \"close Gitmo\", but was thwarted by congressional opposition from both parties. That claim is true as far as it goes, but it does not go very far at all. </p> <p>That's because Obama's plan was not so much to \"close Gitmo\" as it was <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/07/23/the_obama_gitmo_myth/\">simply to relocate it</a> a few thousand miles north onto US soil, with its system of indefinite detention \u2013 which makes the camp so odious \u2013 fully preserved. That is why civil liberties groups such as the ACLU <a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/national-security/creating-gitmo-north-alarming-step-says-aclu\">harshly denounced</a> Obama's plan as \"Gitmo North\". As the ACLU explained, long before Congress obstructed what Obama wanted to do, \"the administration plans to continue its predecessor's policy of indefinite detention without charge or trial for some detainees, with only a change of location.\"</p> <p>Indeed, as I <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/07/23/the_obama_gitmo_myth/\">documented several months ago</a>, the system of indefinite detention from the start has been central to Obama's plan for these detainees. Put another way, even if Congress had given Obama everything he wanted, the system that means that death is the only way out for many detainees would have been fully preserved. The excuse-making for Obama \u2013 <em>\"oh, he tried to close the camp but Congress would not let him\"</em> \u2013 is simply a deceitful tactic Democrats have concocted to justify their total silence about a grave injustice they once pretended to find so appalling and their raucous swooning for a president who supports it.</p> <p>There is, however, one significant difference in this regard between Bush's and Obama's policies. Whereas Bush preferred to detain people without due process or judicial review, Obama simply kills them. Bush's former NSA and CIA director, General Michael Hayden, <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/09/bush-obama-war-on-terror/\">spoke this week at the University of Michigan</a> and, as he (<a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/10/11/continuity/\">yet again</a>) heaped praise on Obama for continuing the crux of the Bush/Cheney approach to terrorism, he made this precise point, as reported by Wired [my emphasis]:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"President Barack Obama has closely followed the policy of his predecessor, President George W Bush, when it comes to tactics used in the 'war on terror' \u2013 from rendition, targeted killings, state secrets, Guant\u00e1namo Bay to domestic spying, according to Michael Hayden, Bush's former director of the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency.</p> <p>\"'But let me repeat my hypothesis: Despite the frequent drama at the political level, America and Americans have found a comfortable center line in what it is they want their government to do and what it is they accept their government doing. It is that practical consensus that has <em>fostered such powerful continuity between two vastly different presidents, George W Bush and Barack Obama, when it comes, when it comes to this conflict</em>,' Hayden said Friday while speaking at the University of Michigan \u2026</p> <p>\"'And so, we've seen all of these continuities between two very different human beings, President Bush and President Obama. We are at war, targeted killings have continued; in fact, if you look at the statistics, targeted killings have increased under Obama.'</p> <p>\"He said that was the case because, in one differing path between the two presidents, Obama in 2009 closed CIA 'black sites' and ratcheted down on torturing detainees. But instead of capturing so-called 'enemy combatants', President Obama kills them instead, Hayden said.</p> <p>\"'We have made it so politically dangerous and so legally difficult that <em>we don't capture anyone anymore,' Hayden said. 'We take another option, we kill them.</em> Now. I don't morally oppose that'\".</p> </blockquote> <p>Of all the pretzels of hypocrisy Democratic partisans have twisted themselves into, in order to defend their leader, this has to be the most extraordinary. They spent years screaming bloody murder because Bush and Cheney merely wanted to eavesdrop on and detain people, including Americans, without any judicial review: <em>a shredding of our constitution, an assault on our values, a blight on our nation</em>, they bellowed. During the Bush years, I echoed those same sentiments.</p> <p>Yet now, when their own party's leader seizes the power to target people (including their own fellow citizens), with no judicial review, not for mere eavesdropping or detention, but for assassination, they have nothing to say \u2013 except to <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/02/08/repulsive_progressive_hypocrisy/\">express their approval</a> and even <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/liberal-msnbc-guest-slams-networks-dnc-coverage-felt-like-obama-for-america-meet-up/\">admiration for his \"toughness\".</a> </p> <p>Identically, that Obama sought to continue the wretched system of indefinite detention that causes people like this latest detainee to spend his entire life in a prison camp with no charges could not be less of an issue to them and, therefore, continues with little opposition.</p>",
  "<p>Realising that neither a full-scale military intervention nor Libya-style air strikes are feasible options for Syria, some western politicians are considering a Yemeni-style transition of power in Damascus.</p> <p>The three main aspects of the Yemeni model were based on <a href=\"http://www.al-bab.com/blog/2011/blog1111a.htm#yemen_a_question_of_immunity\" title=\"\">granting immunity</a> to the Yemeni leader from persecution, <a href=\"www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17177720\" title=\"\">transferring his political power to his deputy</a>, and forming a national consensus government, with half of the ministers from the ruling party. For many reasons, however, such a model would be difficult to implement in today's explosive and badly traumatised Syrian socio-political arena.</p> <p>First, from an international relations point of view Yemen is fundamentally different. The roadmap for political transition in Yemen was designed mainly by Saudi Arabia, the powerful giant of the Arabian peninsula, which has a vast network of patronage-based close connections with numerous state and non-state actors inside Yemen. Riyadh has the ability \u2013 and every national security reason \u2013 to throw its weight behind brokering a peaceful transition of power in Sana'a. The Yemeni political file, basically, is a Saudi security file.</p> <p>The crisis in Syria, on the other hand, has a far wider international context: it is about strategic alliances with Iran, Russia and China \u2013 the growing anti-US hegemony nexus in the post-cold war era. Unlike Yemen's politically and culturally homogenous neighbourhood of oil-rich gulf monarchies, the Syrian neighbourhood is heterogeneous, with clashing political agendas and interests inside Syria.</p> <p>Therefore the roadmap to transition in Syria, unlike that in Yemen, cannot be regionally designed. The insistence of Russia on deleting from the UN resolution any text that calls for President Assad to transfer power to his deputy illustrates the difficulty of applying the Yemeni model.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The divergence of the interests of major international players in Syria stands in a sharp contrast to the convergence of their interests in implementing the Saudi-orchestrated Yemeni model of transition. The Yemeni formula also serves Washington's narrow fixation on knocking out terror threats emanating from the country.</p> <p>Second, the degree and duration of the brutal response of the Assad regime to the popular uprisings has exceeded the aggressive reactions of all the regimes of the toppled leaders of Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen and Libya. As a result, the collective traumatising experience of Syrian society today is much wider and far deeper than&#xa0;in all the other places visited by the Arab Spring. With tens of thousands killed, scores of towns destroyed and hundreds of thousands seeking refuge in camps along the borders with Jordan and Turkey, it's difficult to imagine the duplication of Yemen's scenario for peaceful transition of power.</p> <p>Third, President Ali Abdullah Saleh's Yemen was a fragile political entity governed by a familial-clan-tribal structure, which penetrated the institutionally faceless and heavily tribalised military. The structure was sustained via a network of patronage. At society level, the chronic weakness of Yemen's central authority, and the long continuous history of instability have equipped the people of Yemen with the skills of resilience, traditional conflict resolution and mediation, quick absorption of political shocks and coping with uncertainties.</p> <p>Owing to the unique particularities of the fabric of the Yemeni society, the Saleh option secured a safe political exit for the political leader without dragging his clan or tribe into a battle with the rest of the society.</p> <p>The strongly centralised and iron-fisted Assad regime in Syria, on the other hand, is centred on sectarian-based control of the military, security and state institutions. The fierce <em>mukhabarat</em> (intelligence) state of the Assad regime has deepened sectarian paranoia. In generic terms, it is far more problematic to deal with the aftermath of bringing down a sectarian-based regime than dealing with the aftermath of removing a tribal-based regime. Sect is constructed on the foundations of an ideology; tribe is a dynamic identity.</p> <p>If Assad did agree togive away his presidential chair in return for immunity from prosecution, as Saleh did in Yemen, and the perpetrators of the atrocities in Syria are not brought to justice, the urge for revenge against the Alawite sect will become the way for many Syrians to avoid further suffering. The application of the Yemeni model in Syria would fuel a sectarian existential battle.</p> <p>The double standards of the international community on the issue of the Arab spring, and the consequences of toppling four Arab leaders teach us that democracy and respect for human rights cannot be delivered from the sky or via foreign military intervention.

  "<p><em>Today's extract from the updated edition of <strong>The phone-hacking scandal: journalism on trial,*</strong> is by <strong>Steven Barnett</strong>. Arguing that ownership is the key to the exercise of press freedom, he outlines the principles and policies required to create an effective ownership regime. He begins by considering why it matters...</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395983998\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/11/1347370993509/HackBookFront.jpg\" alt=\"hac\" width=\"165\" height=\"250\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Corporate culture, and the decisions that flow from it, have a direct bearing on media content. It does not require a heavy-handed interventionist owner overtly to dictate editorial priorities.</p> <p>Editorial influence can be achieved as much through acts of omission as<br>commission and through investment and personnel decisions, appointing like-minded lieutenants who are trusted to pursue styles or news agendas that are consonant with their owner's view of the world. </p> <p>Through this process of osmosis, media owners routinely influence the nature and style of stories, programmes, ideas and expressions of opinion that are disseminated through their media outlets.</p> <p>Thus, one of Rupert Murdoch's editors described him as running his empire \"by phone and by clone\". According to one of his most senior executives, Murdoch very rarely issued directives or instructions to his senior executives or editors. Instead, he made known his personal viewpoint on a certain matter. </p> <p>What was expected in return, at least from those seeking tenure of any length in the Murdoch empire, was a sort of \"anticipatory compliance\" - an almost unconscious absorption of corporate values.</p> <p>It does not require the unsubtle interventions of a Lord Beaverbrook or a Robert Maxwell for ownership to have a demonstrable and substantial impact on editorial output. </p> <p>Moreover, the professional values and practices of journalists themselves will inevitably be influenced by, and sometimes subordinated to, the corporate world vision and editorial inclinations of the owner and editor. </p> <p>These overarching pressures underline the need to put in place structural mechanisms which ensure that those owners who are prepared to allow \u2013 and perhaps even encourage \u2013 unethical practices in pursuit of profit, will at least be challenged on an equal footing by other more principled media enterprises.</p> <h2>Unaccountable corporate power</h2> <p>As the scandal around phone-hacking unravelled, with stories of police corruption and political connivance, it became increasingly clear that the heart of the problem lay in a burgeoning and unaccountable corporate power. </p> <p>It derived partly from incessant cross-promotion of corporate and commercial interests, and a relentless hounding of the regulator which verged on intimidation.</p> <p>News Corporation \u2013 whatever the denials of Rupert Murdoch to the contrary in his disingenuous evidence to the Leveson inquiry \u2013 has long demonstrated an understanding of how its media properties can enhance its worldwide commercial activities, calling on its huge editorial presence to mobilise interest in new product launches, pricing innovations, major sports contracts or Hollywood movies. </p> <p>Conversely, it can obstruct competitors by failing to publicise rival initiatives, or by distorting coverage against them. Perhaps the best documented example in Britain occurred during the launch of Sky TV in 1989. An independent study from Manchester university found that the (then) five News International titles were used as vehicles for promoting Sky at the expense of its satellite rival, British Satellite Broadcasting, devoting more than seven times as much space to promotional events than other national papers. </p> <p>An integral element of this corporate strategy by News Corp to promote its wider commercial interests has involved almost relentlessly negative coverage and commentary on the BBC.</p> <p>Other examples abound of promoting corporate self-interest. In 1994, in pursuit of his business interests in China, Murdoch removed the BBC's international news from his Asian Star satellite service because the Chinese authorities had been offended by a BBC programme about Mao Zedong. </p> <p>The lesson is abundantly clear: the greater the consolidation, the smaller will become the opportunity for genuinely independent and critical reflection across a whole range of reporting activities.</p> <p>Theoretically, an effective regulator should be able to curb excessive corporate power. In the UK, while Ofcom has demonstrated its independence and determination to implement its statutory duties under the 2003 Communications Act, it has been vulnerable to the burgeoning power of BSkyB in the television market and to attack from News International newspapers.</p> <p>BSkyB now has enormous economic power in that market: its revenues of \u00a36.8bn in 2012 \u2013 and annual profits of \u00a31.2bn \u2013 are not far below the combined revenues of the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5. The vast majority of this revenue comes from pay TV, which has increased 40% over the last five years despite the economic downturn. </p> <p>Even without News Corp as its controlling shareholder, this would be a hugely powerful media enterprise in the context of British broadcasting. No wonder Murdoch wanted to control the whole shooting match.</p> <p>BSkyB derives its strength primarily from its stranglehold over premium sports rights, particularly Premier League football. It has already been deemed by Ofcom to be exploiting its market power in its wholesale pricing strategy for premium sports channels, and also holds exclusive contracts with the six US studio majors for films within the subscription pay TV window as well as securing exclusive access to all HBO programming. </p> <p>Every regulatory decision and investigation by Ofcom is denounced and challenged by Sky through lengthy and costly litigation that drains the resources of the regulator and other competitor parties. So a powerful media conglomerate can enhance its power by subjecting the regulator to intense, unremitting pressure through regulatory challenges that also serve to diminish the competitive muscle of its rivals.</p> <h2>Regulation: what needs to change</h2> <p>The current regime needs to be replaced by a new legislative framework based on clear, unambiguous principles of promoting the maximum number of viable media enterprises while preventing the massive accretion of corporate power.</p> <p>The new Communications Act likely to be enacted during the 2014-2015 parliamentary session is an ideal opportunity for root and branch reform. It needs to incorporate eight key changes:</p> <p><strong>1.</strong> <em>Launching an inquiry</em>. Discretion for initiating an inquiry into media mergers, acquisitions, or other market activity with potentially harmful consequences for media plurality, should not be vested solely in the secretary of state. It should be held jointly by the minister and by Ofcom.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> <em>Flexible triggers.</em> Greater flexibility is required in the circumstances which might trigger such an inquiry, including organic growth. </p> <p><strong>3.</strong> <em>Regular reviews.</em> Share of market and share of audience should be monitored on a regular basis by Ofcom to provide the data for making any necessary public interest interventions.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> <em>Eliminate regulatory overlap.</em> Under the current regime, both Ofcom and the Competition Commission have a role in determining whether there are plurality grounds for refusing a merger or acquisition. During the inquiry over BSkyB's 17.9% stake in ITV, they came to opposite conclusions about whether the deal would represent a threat to plurality. Ofcom should be given authority over all such inquiries.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> <em>Eliminate the politics.</em> Final decisions on divestments, conditions, and mitigations should not be left to government ministers for whom it is virtually impossible to make decisions in a \"quasi-judicial\" capacity. Just as decisions on competition issues are currently binding \u2013 subject to appeal and, ultimately, through the courts \u2013 so should Ofcom's decisions on media ownership.</p> <p><strong>6.</strong> <em>Public interest obligations.</em> These might include increased investment in original journalism, training initiatives, subsidies for non-profit media initiatives elsewhere, appointment of an independent ombudsman, and an automatic right of reply, with equal prominence, for inaccurate stories.</p> <p><strong>7.</strong> <em>Transparency.</em> All communication and negotiations between relevant parties \u2013 both formal and informal \u2013 must be properly recorded and minuted. There should be an assumption in favour of publication, subject only to a convincing case for commercial confidentiality.</p> <p><strong>8.</strong> <em>Accountability.</em> There will need to be some mechanism of accountability to parliament, which could take the form of mandatory appearances in front of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee and its Lords equivalent. Though constitutionally unable to overturn the regulator's decision, a highly critical (and unanimous) committee report will bear heavily on subsequent Ofcom enquiries.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This is an unprecedented opportunity for our political leaders to produce a coherent media policy that maximises the number of viable media enterprises, and ensures that such unrestrained media power is never again allowed to accumulate in the hands of a single, dominant media owner.</p> <p><em>Tomorrow:</em> <strong>Nicholas Jones</strong> on why the Leveson hearings were a missed opportunity because they failed to get to grips with Rupert Murdoch's influence on the British press</p> <p>*<em>The phone hacking scandal: journalism on trial</em>, second and updated edition, edited by Richard Lance Keeble and John Mair, will be published by Abramis on 17 September.

  "<p>Glenys Stacey, the head of the exams watchdog Ofqual, has admitted that she would have forced one of England's biggest exam boards to alter its GCSE English boundaries to avoid grade inflation had it not agreed to voluntarily this summer.</p> <p>The regulator has the power to direct grade boundary changes and would have done so if Edexcel had not revised them this summer, she suggested. Exam boards moved the grade boundaries this summer in order to avoid inflation in the results, leading to an outcry from schools complaining that their students had been moved down a grade.</p> <p>The disclosure came as new figures showed that at least 143 secondary schools were set to fall below the government's floor target for pupils achieving at least five Cs including English and maths as a result of the GCSE English fiasco \u2013 putting them at risk of being considered failing.</p> <p>Appearing before the Commons education select committee on Tuesday, Stacey was asked what Ofqual would have done if Edexcel had stuck to its first response to the regulator and insisted that its proposed grade boundaries were fair.</p> <p>\"If they had done so, then the legislation provides that the regulator can direct grade boundary changes,\" Stacey said. Pushed on whether Ofqual would have done this, she added: \"I think we would have done, yes.\"</p> <p>The admission shows the extent of the pressure on the exam boards to move the boundary this summer.</p> <p>The inquiry was taking place after the Times Educational Supplement published letters between Ofqual and Edexcel on Tuesday, which appeared to show Ofqual putting pressure on the examiner to lower the English grades in the weeks before they were published.</p> <p>Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, claimed that pupils who sat their English GCSEs this summer were given lower grades to compensate for the award of inflated grades to students who sat the exam earlier in the year.</p> <p>Lightman said 26.7% of students who sat foundation tier units in English a year early in June last year had got a grade C, while in January that figure had jumped to 37% and in June it dropped sharply to 10.2%.</p> <p>\"These are enormous differences and there's no evidence that those papers had any difference in the level of challenge between those times,\" said Lightman. \"Therefore it cannot be that the standard was the same across those two years.\"</p> <p>One of the MPs, Damian Hinds, asked whether Lightman was suggesting that pupils who sat the exams this June were \"particularly harshly treated\" and marked down so that across the whole year group the results were in line with previous years.</p> <p>Lightman replied: \"You have hit the nail on the head there. That's what did happen, we think.\" Challenged to justify his claim, Lightman added: \"That's the 10.2% statistic I quoted. How can it be in January 37% were getting a C, and in June 10.2? It's been adjusted to give a comparable outcome across the year cohort.\"</p> <p>Questioned later in the session, Stacey defended Ofqual's handling of the problem. Ofqual has admitted that the grade boundaries were moved, but suggested that the downgrading in June was only to correct an over-generous boundary earlier in the year, saying pupils in January \"got lucky\". Pupils who failed this summer have been offered a free resit in November.</p> <p>Stacey said that before the grades were amended, Edexcel had been planning to release grades that would have been a 6-7% \"inflation\" in the pass rate, something they assess based on previous year's results and pupils' results earlier at key stage two.</p> <p>Stacey also resisted calls for the grades to be revisited, which would hold out the prospect of some pupils who had failed being given a pass. \"The June boundary setting was done properly,\" said Stacey.</p> <p>The headteachers' leaders also said there was evidence that other grade boundaries \u2013 A*, A and B \u2013 had been affected by the raising of the boundary for the C grade, and there was some evidence that a similar problem might have occurred in maths, though on a smaller scale.</p> <p>Mike Griffiths, headmaster of Northampton school for boys, defended a strong statement in which he said that pupils who should have passed with a grade C had had their \"future destroyed\".</p> <p>\"I know a number of youngsters who are dropping out who shouldn't be,\" said Griffiths. \"It depends on their background and the support they get.\"</p>",
  "<h2><strong>1 Working with Ivan Lendl</strong></h2> <p>It is too simplistic to suggest that the arrival of Ivan Lendl at the turn of the year changed Andy Murray from a serial runner-up into <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/sep/11/andy-murray-us-open-novak-djokovic\" title=\"\">a grand slam champion</a> but the player has acknowledged what Lendl has brought to the table. Having lost his first four grand slam finals before winning eight, Lendl knows what Murray has been feeling in the buildup to big moments and has helped him to relax and believe in his game. Having someone such as him back you and your ability to win the sport's biggest titles has added to Murray's inner belief and he has helped the Scot to commit to go for his shots and never have any regrets. In the big moments against Novak Djokovic, especially after the fourth set, Murray stepped closer to the baseline again and was aggressive while always being in control. That was pure Lendl.</p> <h2><strong>2 Winning Olympic gold</strong></h2> <p>There is nothing like winning a big one to give you the taste for more. Lendl told Murray the pressure was off in New York because he had already won a \"major\", <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/blog/2012/jul/08/andy-murray-roger-federer-wimbledon\" title=\"\">driven on by the near miss at Wimbledon</a> a few weeks beforehand and by a patriotic and at times raucous crowd. Victories over Djokovic <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/03/andy-murray-olympic-gold-medal-chance\" title=\"\">in the Olympic semi-final</a> and then <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/05/andy-murray-olympic-gold-great-britain\" title=\"\">revenge over Federer</a> in the final for that Wimbledon loss were stunning performances and convinced Murray that he really did belong in the same breath as those two and Rafael Nadal. Perhaps more importantly, it may even have shown the top three that Murray would no longer be crushed by doubt and was now a true champion. As Lendl said, if that was worth one or two points in a match, perhaps a point in that dramatic first-set tie-break on Monday, then it was all worth it.</p> <h2><strong>3 Pushing Djokovic so close in Australia</strong></h2> <p>In the immediate aftermath of Monday's win, Lendl mentioned how crucial Murray's performance <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jan/27/novak-djokovic-andy-murray-australian-open\" title=\"\">in the semi-final of the Australian Open</a> in January had been to his progress. The way the Scot matched Djokovic for almost five hours, physically and mentally, gave him huge belief that the next time they went toe to toe over five sets in the heat of the battle, he would be able to live with the Serb. When the pair met in the final of the Australian Open in 2011, Murray froze; this time, he knew that despite a long hard summer he had enough in the tank to stay with Djokovic, even when the inevitable fightback began. Having first played each other in an under-12 event in France there are no secrets between the two friends, but after Melbourne Murray knew that, despite the disappointment, he was right there. Djokovic would have known it too.</p> <h2><strong>4 That bit of luck</strong></h2> <p>Unlike Federer, Nadal and Djokovic himself, all of whom played \"lesser\" players in their first grand slam final, Murray's four previous attempts had been thwarted by proven champions (Federer three times and Djokovic once). This time, with no Nadal to worry about and placed in Federer's half, he benefited from not having the mental stress of trying to beat the Swiss after he lost to Tomas Berdych in the quarters. Berdych could not handle the wind against Murray in the semis and then the extra day of rest he had had countered the fact that he had spent five hours more on court than Djokovic going into the final. It is hard to say whether that helped in the deciding set of the final on Monday because Djokovic is a phenomenal athlete. But it can't have hurt. Murray deserved that bit of luck and he took advantage.</p> <h2><strong>5 The New York crowd and those Wimbledon tears </strong></h2> <p>New Yorkers have always liked Murray; they enjoy the variety he has and they appreciate the mental anguish he sometimes goes through on court. He has been a crowd favourite ever since he won the junior title in New York in 2004 but his speech at Wimbledon after losing to Federer in the final this summer turned an already favourable crowd into true believers. Sitting with some New York fans for the last set of Monday's final, they both mentioned how Murray's speech, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/jul/08/andy-murray-wimbledon-crowd-2012\" title=\"\">when he was fighting back the tears</a>, made him more human and easier to root for and when Djokovic began to fight back they were desperate for Murray to find a second wind. Murray responded, got them involved again and found the energy and the nerve to come through in that tense final set. When Djokovic took an injury time-out at 5-2 down in the decider, they were livid. When Murray won, they were ecstatic.</p>",
  "<p>Recently a debate erupted on Twitter: would outsourcing services, where the focus is often on achieving economies of scale, be an obstacle to better services or an opportunity? While it's true that economies of scale are often treated with suspicion when it comes to the public sector, where the vision of private sector monoliths stacking it high and selling it cheap is understandably unwelcome, we are seeing a growing trend for service providers being enabled to spread their delivery model beyond the boundaries of geography or even service type, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.</p> <p>For our part, the <a href=\"http://www.transitioninstitute.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Transition Institute</a> entered the debate pointing out that while spin-outs can achieve economies of scale, we need to look at how that affects the quality of delivery. This is developed in our publication <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCMQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.transitioninstitute.org.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2012%2F07%2FDRAFT-Starting-Point-Paper-4_Expansion-models_Dan-Gregory.pdf&amp;ei=TgJOUJOPKMXIhAfc5ICQCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFR4m1GvA-ccGUx6wKZMeqXENG_5A&amp;sig2=2gPL3SopkXsqG-BVXgUW3w\" title=\"\">Scaling up Your Business: Expansion Strategies for Spin-Outs</a>, where the benefits to the service user are examined.</p> <p>Once free of geographical or single institution administrative boundaries, spin-outs can spread quickly across boroughs and towns. A good example of this is <a href=\"http://www.better.org.uk/b2b/\" title=\"\">GLL (Greenwich Leisure Limited)</a>, which started from one leisure centre in Greenwich, was threatened by cuts, and has now grown into a company that manages more than 100 facilities across more than 20 local authorities, including <a href=\"https://socialenterprise.guardian.co.uk/social-enterprise-network/2012/jul/11/social-enterprise-olympic-games-london-2012\" title=\"\">the Aquatics Centre in the Olympic Park</a>, and is now looking beyond sports leisure facilities to libraries as possible services that could benefit from their model of co-operative ownership and community engagement.</p> <p>This is how outsourcing service provision can achieve economies of scale, but how can that move also unleash innovation? Does the act of removing administrative boundaries enable providers to look outside the original site or district? Or can enlightened contracting actually encourage increased innovation?</p> <p>A good example is the <a href=\"http://www.innovationunit.org/\" title=\"\">Innovation Unit</a>, an organisation that started life as part of the Department of Education, from which it spun out in 2006. While it was part of the department, the unit supported innovative programmes for schools, and was highly successful in doing so. It is reasonable to assume that the unit would have remained successful had it remained where it was; however by spinning out the department and becoming a self-determining social enterprise, they established a model that enabled a coalition of ideas and innovations developed in studying education trends to other services right the way across the public sector. As an early adopter of independent status, the Innovation Unit now operates in areas like environmental policy, health and social care and education.</p> <p>By spinning out, they have made their transformative potential available to more public services than if they had remained a service managed within the public sector. It is our observation that this trend is helping to build data and models that could generate a more forward looking and innovative public sector.</p> <p>We are seeing more expert agencies that are able to operate beyond a single local authority, and in doing so, move tried and tested ideas from one site to another without the expense of repeated trial and error. A good example is Pure Innovations, which has developed an innovative approach to social care and employment services. Once they had spun out from local authority control they have not only continued to diversify and grow, but have also been able to establish consultancy services.</p> <p>The public sector has started to benefit from agencies like <a href=\"http://www.pureinnovations.co.uk/purely-us.html\" title=\"\">Pure Innovations</a>, the Innovation Unit and GLL, not only through the economies of scale they can generate, but also by looking beyond the sell-by-date approach often found in established but unchallenged public service delivery.</p> <p>One final example is the <a href=\"http://www.clevelandfire.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Cleveland Fire Brigade</a>, which we believe is the first fire and rescue service to spin out and that now plans to finance itself with additional revenue achieved in <a href=\"http://www.clevelandfire.gov.uk/2012/07/cleveland-fire-brigade-wins-ground-breaking-new-contract-that-will-help-keep-community-safe/\" title=\"\">providing services as security consultants</a>. If their model succeeds, they will have found a way to maintain a public service while also generating income from operating as experts in the market place. In this way Cleveland Fire Brigade could act as a useful example to other emergency and security services.</p> <p>These trends are interesting in that they offer solutions at a time when budget cuts and increased demand are prompting commissioners to seek alternative approaches. When an organisation spins out, it could be a success story, not only by achieving economies of scale but by also improving service delivery and increasing the public awareness of a diversity of models beyond the perceptions of conventional public/private sector delivery. In this way these new, enlightened providers are helping to build a more efficient and resilient public sector, fit for the challenging 21st century.</p> <p><em>Allison Ogden-Newton is former chief executive of </em><a href=\"http://www.sel.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Social Enterprise London</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>After pastygate, could <strong>Greggs</strong> now be facing a pig of a problem?</p> <p>That's the view of Jonathan Pritchard at Oriel Securities, who points to reports that pig production is becoming increasingly uneconomic, what with poor weather causing the price of feed to rocket and prospective EU legislation next year.</p> <p>With many pig farmers deciding not to carry on, that would lead to a fall in supply and price inflation. That would be bad news for Greggs, he said, given its \"disproportionate reliance on pork products\" - presumably all those sausage rolls and bacon butties.

  "<p>Children from immigrant families in the UK face \"significant challenges\" in schools which are among the most socially segregated in the developed world, a major annual report has found.</p> <p>According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), children from immigrant as well as poorer backgrounds are more likely to be clustered in disadvantaged schools than their counterparts in other countries such as France, Sweden and the Netherlands.</p> <p>The phenomenon is illustrated by statistics in the latest <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/edu/eag2012.htm\" title=\"\">Education at a Glance </a>report, which found that 80% of children of immigrant families in the UK were being taught in schools with large numbers of other immigrant or disadvantaged pupils \u2013 the highest proportion of any country in the survey and significantly above the OECD average of 68%.</p> <p>It found that 79.8% of immigrant students whose mothers did not receive a high level of education \u2013 five good GCSEs \u2013 attended disadvantaged schools. More surprisingly, among those with highly educated mothers, more than twice as many immigrant students as non-immigrant students attended disadvantaged schools \u2013 42.5% compared to 18%.</p> <p>More than half of non-immigrant children with mothers not educated beyond GCSE level were also in disadvantaged schools, the report found \u2013 a higher proportion than any other country except Canada, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Israel, Japan and Slovakia.</p> <p>The report, which has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/sep/11/education-compared-oecd-country-pisa\" title=\"\">collated data</a> from 2008 and 2009 and compared figures from countries across the developed world, said: \"The socioeconomic composition of UK schools poses significant challenges for disadvantaged students and students with an immigrant background.\"</p> <p>The OECD warns that high concentrations of disadvantage in schools can have a strong influence on students' outcomes in life.</p> <p>The government hopes its \"pupil premium\" scheme \u2013 which should pump extra money to schools with a large number of disadvantaged students \u2013 will help ease the problem, alongside new free schools and academies in deprived areas.</p> <p>The Department for Education said: \"We are determined to tackle the appalling gap in attainment and opportunity between the richest and poorest pupils.

  "<p>If you are an Indian, you are probably angry, sad or deeply frustrated at the moment. In the past few years the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, and his coalition government have been embroiled in corruption scam after corruption scam, from the embarrassing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/25/delhi-commonwealth-games-organiser-arrested\" title=\"\">Commonwealth Games scandal</a> to the massive looting of food stocks. The latest scam, termed \"Coalgate\", involves the <a href=\"http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/india/india-coalgate-corruption\" title=\"\">government allocation of coal</a> and is estimated to have cost the country more than $50bn. For the last two weeks, parliament has ground to a halt, as the opposition and ruling party fight like schoolboys over who is more corrupt. From bitter experience, Indians know that all political parties are equally, obscenely, venal.</p> <p>So, it is ludicrous that cartoonist Aseem Trivedi was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/10/indian-cartoonist-jailed-sedition\" title=\"\">taken into custody</a> on Sunday for drawing what everyone is thinking. Trivedi has been charged with sedition and insulting the constitution for a series of <a href=\"http://cartoonsagainstcorruption.blogspot.in/\" title=\"\">anti-corruption cartoons</a>. One replaces the three lions of India's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashoka_Chakra\" title=\"\">Ashoka symbol</a>, the national emblem, with three bloody-jawed wolves. The usual legend under the symbol is <em>Satyamev Jayate</em>, translated as \"truth alone triumphs\". Trivedi's version changes the line to <em>Bhrastamev Jayate</em> which means \"corruption alone triumphs\". Another cartoon shows the 26/11 terrorist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jul/20/mumbai-terrorist-attacks-gunman-trial\" title=\"\">Ajmal Kasab</a> urinating on the Indian constitution.

Yet, the explanation points out that comments expressing \"disapprobation \u2026 with a view to obtain their alteration by lawful means\" are not offences. Nowhere has Trivedi called for a violent overthrow of the government.

  "<p>The rush hour coincides with nightfall in Lima, Peru's capital (population 8.4 million). Avenida Javier Prado, which crosses the city, is packed with hundreds of buses and brightly coloured combis (mini-buses), all competing to attract passengers, whose number determines the driver's wages.</p> <p>The jam amuses tourists, who see it as typical of the modern city, so different from the aristocratic stronghold founded nearly 480 years ago by the Spanish, who set up the court of the viceroyalty of Peru here. But all these different-sized buses are a nightmare for Lima's residents, who spend an average of two to three hours a day in the creaking transit system.</p> <p>The leftwing leader of the city council, Susana Villar\u00e1n, who was elected in 2010, is determined to end the mess. \"We want to guarantee well ordered transport and get rid of the chaos and accidents which cost so many lives,\" she said, adding that she will not be discouraged by transport union strikes.</p> <p>Reform of public transport, so often promised but never implemented, is one of the biggest challenges facing the sprawling conurbation which extends more than 40km from north to south. \"More than 80% of Lima residents use public transport,\" says deputy mayor Eduardo Zegarra. He condemns the \"slow, poor quality service\", which he blames on the \"complete lack of control for several decades\".</p> <p>At present 30,000 buses operate in the city, competing with 200,000 taxis, many unlicensed. By regulating public transport and taking the oldest, most polluting vehicles off the road, the city council hopes to halve the number of buses by 2021. Improving the efficiency of vehicles still operating should lead to reduced journey times. \"This reform will have a huge impact, in particular on the quality of life of the poorest members of the community living in the outskirts,\" says Zegarra, adding that one-fifth of Lima's population lives in poverty.</p> <p>After coping with the massive influx of migrants from the Andes and the Amazon basin between 1960 and 1990, population growth in the Peruvian capital has steadied.</p> <p>\"It's a city of young people which has really taken shape in the past few decades,\" Zegarra says. He believes that Lima should stop spreading outwards and rise upwards instead. \"More sprawl entails major costs and problems providing basic services,\" he explains.</p> <p>\"The problem is that policies are being introduced for the benefit of middle-class and wealthy groups, not for working-class,\" says town planner Gustavo Riofr\u00edo, who condemns the lack of government aid for Lima's poorest communities.</p> <p>\"There is a lot to be done to promote vertical growth in the most deprived areas where thousands of families live in harsh conditions,\" Zegarra admits. Despite powerful economic growth in Peru over the past 11 years, more than 1&#xa0;million Lima residents still lack access to clean drinking water.</p> <p>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/\" title=\"\">Le Monde</a></p>",
  "<p>Beauty is famously in the eye of the beholder, and for some of the beholders in <a href=\"http://www.northumberland-coast.co.uk/alnmouth.php\">Alnmouth</a>, the concept doesn't include a sky-blue ice cream van decorated with beige-yellow cones.</p> <p>The beautiful port, selected by the <em>Guardian Northerner</em> as the place to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/aug/21/uk-cheapest-flat-alnwick-alnmouth-northumberland\">start a new life</a>, Reggie Perrin-style, should that ever be necessary, rose up earlier this year to try to get the 'mobile eyesore' moved on.</p> <p>Or some of it did, to be accurate. Another 300 people signed a petition saying that Helen Smith and her cornets, choc bars and lollies should be allowed to stay.</p> <p>Their view and Mrs Smith have now prevailed after quite a complicated exercise in local democracy which has gone on since May. That was when the van's street-trading licence, granted in 2010 for a site at the corner of Riverside Road, came up for renewal and <a href=\"http://www.apc.alnmouth.org.uk/\">Alnmouth parish council </a>objected on grounds including the damage to the view.</p> <p>The little port and estuary of the river Aln is part of an area of outstanding natural beauty on the Northumberland coast, and the <a href=\"http://www.northumberland.gov.uk/\">county council </a>accepted the parish's view, as those closest to the van.

It was initiated to address prenuptial and post-nuptial agreements, as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/radmacher-divorce-case\" title=\"\">Radmacher v Granatino case</a> progressed through the courts. . A string of subsequent cases, notably <a href=\"http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2011/41.html\" title=\"\">Jones v Jones</a>, have thrown the unpredictability and confusion which bedevils the overall division of marital property on divorce into sharp relief. But should sperm count as a marital asset?</p> <p>At first glance, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2003/sep/19/genetics.uknews\" title=\"\">Diane Blood</a> and the unnamed Surrey woman who currently <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2193780/Sperm-donation-Wife-man-secretly-donated-sperm-calls-spouses-consent-mandatory.html\" title=\"\">seeks a reform of the rules on sperm donation</a> might seem unlikely bedfellows. Blood, over a decade ago, sought and won the right to use her husband's sperm, taken while he was in a coma, without his explicit consent. The unnamed woman, whose husband donated sperm without her consent, seeks to prevent that from happening again. The common ground is an idea of the communality of sperm as a shared resource of the marriage.</p> <p>Blood cited the marriage vow \"All that I have is yours\" to support the proposition that she should be entitled to use the sperm; the unnamed woman believes the sperm \"must be some sort of marital asset\" and therefore that she should be able to stop her husband using it. Both believe: if you're married to me I control your sperm.</p> <p>This recent debate arises following the government's disastrous decision to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/jan/26/uk.health1\" title=\"\">remove anonymity</a> from sperm donors, effected by the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2004/1511/contents/made\" title=\"\">Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority Regulations 2004</a>. Donor-born children conceived after 1 April 2005 can now apply to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority when they reach 18 to find out the identity of the donor. The concern is that 18-year-olds will be turning up out of the blue on doorsteps all over the country to meet their biological fathers and disrupting family life. Far from what your average altruistic donor anticipates at the time of providing a service designed to help infertile couples conceive.</p> <p>The regulations were introduced because it was considered important that a child know his or her genetic origins. Controversially, this was placed ahead of donors' rights to privacy.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/oct/19/egg-sperm-donors-more-compensation\" title=\"\">Reports suggest</a> clinics are suffering shortages of donor sperm and there is evidence that infertile couples are seeking treatment abroad in order to avoid their donor's identity being discovered. The regulations may have also made it less likely that infertile parents will tell their child he or she was born as a result of assisted reproduction. Won't this prevent more children from knowing their origins? It will be worse, from a health perspective, than the halfway-house before the reforms, in which children could access certain information for medical purposes without revealing identity.</p> <p>The unnamed woman feels that to have a child from a sperm donation arrive at their door would be like having introducing a child from an adulterous relationship into her family. Equally, she feels she would not be able to turn that child away or avoid emotionally engaging with him or her.</p> <p>Beyond emotional demands, there is also the risk of financial claims. The law has proven itself unpredictable, and a donor cannot feel safe from shifts in policy with retrospective effect. While there are presently legal distinctions in place to prevent sperm donation in certain circumstances giving rise to legal fatherhood, the rules are tight.</p> <p>Either the donation takes place via a licensed clinic, or to a married/civilly partnered woman, with a consenting husband/civil partner, without intercourse. A man who selflessly donates sperm to help friends or acquaintances conceive in more informal circumstances or without the woman's partner being married/civilly partnered to them will find that he, as the biological father, is also the legal father. That means he could be liable for child maintenance or even provision of a home for the mother and child.</p> <p>The unnamed woman's position is not unsympathetic. It seems to come from a position of warmth - she feels her husband took a unilateral decision to enable the creation of children with whom she is likely to feel emotionally involved. Therefore she feels entitled to have had a right of veto. You can see why she feels it should have been a shared decision.</p> <p>However, taking control of another person's right to reproduce, or indeed to donate blood, organs or make other such gifts of themselves simply because you are married to them is a bridge too far. Anyway, men bring abut the creation of children through extra-marital relations all the time. What are wives to do to control that?</p> <p><em>Ayesha Vardag is a divorce lawyer.

  "<p>Delivery was the watchword in Downing Street as the prime minister shuffled his pack last week. By that token, an innocent observer might have imagined that there are calm waters ahead for the Department for Work and Pensions. After all, the new ministerial team is remarkably like the old one. Steve Webb and David Freud stay in place as the brains of the operation on, respectively, pensions and welfare. Former TV presenter Esther McVey picks up disability, and a man from the Treasury \u2013 Mark Hoban \u2013 moves into operational charge of employment, but neither move signifies any great shake-up as much as the fact that their ambitious predecessors have taken another step up. Most important of all, the grand architect of the universal credit, Iain Duncan Smith, remains at the helm.</p> <p>Our innocent observer, however, would not have clocked that the promotion of the outgoing employment minister, Chris Grayling, who has taken charge of the Ministry of Justice, was possible only because Duncan Smith had obstinately refused to budge when the PM pleaded with him to go there. The reality is that Whitehall in general, and the Treasury in particular, is decidedly nervous about looming welfare reforms. Indeed, George Osborne and his officials were desperate to send IDS packing, fearing that this former Scots Guard, who is supremely convinced that he has the answers, has set off on a merry march that will end in big bills, or \u2013 worse \u2013 abject chaos.</p> <p>Whitehall intrigue aside, what does the prospect of another two years of IDS entail for benefit claimants? First, the good news, so desperately needed with all those cuts in the pipeline. Duncan Smith will fight to prevent the next phase of austerity being so heavily loaded on to working-age poor. Indeed, he <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17877732\" title=\"\">went public</a> against Osborne when the chancellor signalled he wanted another \u00a310bn on top of the \u00a318bn in annual cuts already announced. Duncan Smith is proud of his big idea, and painfully aware that the credit is compromised by want of funds. He won't stop the blood-letting from social security, but \u2013 popular with his party \u2013 he might just have the clout to minimise it.</p> <p>Design is one thing, however, delivery is another. The bad news is that another prolongation of the IDS tenure carries acute operational risks. Duncan Smith is far better on the morality (or his version of&#xa0;it \u2013 which mixes charity, reward and punishment) and big sweeping themes, such as simplification, than the detail. That much is evident in his breathtaking decision to cede control of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/27/universal-credit-welfare\" title=\"\">council tax rebates to hundreds of cash-strapped town halls</a>, freeing each to reinvent the poverty trap in their own way.</p> <p>But it is evident, too, in the disregard for potential practical snags that could yet unravel the whole system. It was only decided this summer, for instance, that <a href=\"http://www.landlordreferencing.co.uk/blog/2012/06/23/confirmed-universal-credit-ends-direct-payment-of-housing-benefit-to-landlords/\" title=\"\">landlords will lose their right</a> to demand direct payment of rents. Some warn of a vicious cycle of defaults, evictions and owners turning benefit cases away. Case workers fear that the move to pay benefits monthly and to process them online will pose huge problems for the millions of poor Britons who are unfamiliar with computers and not used to managing budgets over long periods. There are persistent rumours about software glitches, and \u2013 it <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19534488\" title=\"\">emerged at the weekend</a> \u2013 70 organisations, from charities to businesses, have submitted evidence to a parliamentary committee about these practical dangers to a system that's meant to go live in months.</p> <p>I've not even got on to the Work Programme where providers are said to be feeling the pressure of operating on extraordinarily tight margins in a flatlining jobs market. A separate crisis here could soon test both Hoban and Duncan Smith. The good ship DWP is set for choppy waters all right, even though \u2013 for better, or worse \u2013 the same captain remains at the wheel.</p> <p><em>Tom Clark is the Guardian's social affairs leader writer</em></p>",

Both have been held in maximum security detention for many years, pursuant to a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/05/babar-ahmad-outsourcing-terror-case\" title=\"\">US request for their extradition</a> on charges related to exactly the same conduct for which their UK prosecution is now sought.</p> <p>Their case, together with that of four other terrorist suspects wanted by the US, is currently before the grand chamber of the European court of human rights, which is deliberating whether to hear their appeal against an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/10/abu-hamza-extradited-us-court\" title=\"\">earlier decision of the court</a> this year that their extradition to the US, and possible lifelong detention in solitary confinement, would not breach their human rights.</p> <p>Within minutes of that previous judgment having been handed down, the home secretary, Theresa May, was in front of the television cameras expressing her desire to see the men shipped out of the country at the earliest opportunity. Given that one of them was Abu Hamza, she presumably thought that public opinion would be squarely behind her, and she was probably right.</p> <p>It's not quite that simple, though.</p> <p>Over the years, during the media and parliamentary controversy surrounding cases such as that of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/20/natwest-three-gary-mulgrew-book\" title=\"\">NatWest Three</a>, of which I was one, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/07/open-letter-gary-mckinnon?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Gary McKinnon</a>, the case of Ahmad has been cited almost as a footnote. Arguably, though, it is the case that most strongly demonstrates the need for a UK judge to determine the most appropriate forum for a trial, something which is currently precluded by the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/41/contents\" title=\"\">Extradition Act 2003</a>.</p> <p>Whatever the public prejudice against alleged terrorists, the bald facts are these; Ahmad and Ahsan are two British citizens who are alleged to have run websites from their homes and places of work in London, inciting violent jihad in Afghanistan and Chechnya. Neither has set foot in the US. If they have committed any crime, they have demonstrably committed it in the UK.</p> <p>Today is the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 atrocity. As a result, one of the legacies of the Blair government is some of the world's most draconian anti-terrorist legislation in the UK. So why on earth would we put these men on a plane to America, where the nexus with the case is tenuous at best? Why not try them here?</p> <p>In the original extradition hearing in 2005, the senior magistrate <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4554829.stm\" title=\"\">described Ahmad's as \"a difficult and troubling case</a>\" because there was no doubt that it could be heard in the UK.</p> <p>Ahmad's legal team have spent years pressing for a UK prosecution, as we did, only to be rebuffed by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) on the basis that there was insufficient evidence in their possession to bring a prosecution. In the absence of such a prosecution, as the NatWest Three found, extradition to the US becomes all but inevitable.</p> <p>It was revealed late last year, however, that the reason that the CPS have been claiming that there is insufficient evidence is that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2012/apr/06/babar-ahmad-extradition-laws\" title=\"\">Metropolitan police</a> did not share with them much of what was seized from Ahmad's home in December 2003, instead giving it directly to the US. No explanation for this has yet been forthcoming, despite questions being asked in parliament.</p> <p>I have visited Babar Ahmad in prison, and he knows my views on terrorists as a former soldier who served in Northern Ireland. But he is a British citizen, accused of crimes committed exclusively in Britain, and the right place for any trial is the UK. It's not complicated. It is inconceivable that the US would allow one of their citizens to be extradited if the roles were reversed. Nor should they. The US do legal sovereignty perhaps better than any other nation.</p> <p>Watkin's solicitors clearly believe they have sufficient evidence for the case to be committed to trial here. Public interest therefore demands that it should be.</p> <p>Two separate parliamentary committees have specifically cited Ahmad's as a case which ought to be heard in the UK, and last year nearly 150,000 people signed a <a href=\"http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/885\" title=\"\">petition</a> calling for just that. That is approximately five times the total number of people who voted in Theresa May's constituency at the last general election.</p> <p>In opposition, members of the current cabinet <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmhaff/644/64403.htm\" title=\"\">argued for the \"forum\" test</a> that would see Ahmad, Ahsan and others like them tried in the UK. In government, however, a huge dose of moral cowardice has seemingly replaced their principles.</p> <p>The DPP has it within his power to take over a private prosecution and either run with it, as advocated by Watkin's lawyers, or discontinue it, a course which is doubtless being urgently pressed upon him by the Home Office. To do the latter would be the easy option, but would effectively confirm what many already suspect; that we have forsaken legal sovereignty and outsourced our criminal justice system to America.Doing the right thing is often the hardest, but it is what distinguishes leaders from followers.We are all Babar Ahmad and Talha Ahsan.</p>",

On the Institute for Government blog, Peter Thomas asks <a href=\"http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/4849/who-wants-to-be-a-senior-civil-servant/?source=rss&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Publicsectorblogs+%28PublicSectorBlogs%29\" title=\"\">Who wants to be a senior civil servant</a>? Downsizing, a dwindling sense of personal achievement and continuous criticism from ministers, advisers and select committees may all be factors in recent departures of high profile senior civil servants, he suggests:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Downsizing at this scale and pace inevitably takes a toll on the capacity, energy and emotions of managers and senior leaders. The requirements of consultation, selection for redundancy, matching remaining staff to the remaining posts create a huge management burden on line managers. Overstretched HR functions are left with little capacity to do anything else. It is draining to run comprehensive downsizing programmes.<br>Civil Service managers and their much abused HR colleagues deserve credit for managing big reductions in staff \u2013 up to 30% in little more than 15 months. With the support of the better trade unions this has generally been done as fairly and humanely as you could expect given the pace of reductions.<br>Some who saw this phase through have already seized their voluntary redundancy or even resigned with a sense of relief and sometimes glee \u2013 depending on their age, their ability to get another job, or the respective sizes of their redundancy package, savings and pension.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the public leaders network Kevin Lloyd explains <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network/2012/sep/11/civil-service-whitehall-voluntary-redundancy\" title=\"\">why he left the civil service</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don't regret leaving. What I observe about further change in Whitehall suggests that much of it would not have been positive from my perspective. What, for instance, are the consequences of the well-publicised suggestion that ministers should have a say in annual appraisals and the emergence of ministers on departmental boards that will be considering a whole range of organisational arrangements?<br>It is probably not too fanciful to see the odd sign that being a civil servant, certainly at very senior levels, is now viewed by some less as a vocation and a career and more as a philanthropic gesture once the hard yards have been done in business or finance.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Lloyd will be on the panel for a public leaders discussion on Thursday about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network/2012/sep/06/civil-service-talent-getting-out\" title=\"\">whether the civil service is failing its talent</a></p> <p>\u2022 Defining <strong>social enterprise</strong>. Following the news that computing specialist Salesforce.com has given up an effort to trademark the term \"social enterprise,\" David Floyd on his Beanbags and Bullsh!t blog admits he is <a href=\"http://beanbagsandbullsh1t.com/2012/09/09/may-salesforce-be-with-you/\" title=\"\">sceptical about the idea that we need a definition of social enterprise</a>. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Frankly, I couldn't care less if, at various points in the past, woolly definition of social enterprise has led to private sector businesses receiving some free business planning training or a free Business Link mouse-mat. It's more of an issue when there's important services and serious cash involved.<br>There's also the Public Services (Social Value) Act 2012, which will come in force next year. While being a social enterprise is no guarantee of providing additional social value, and not being a social enterprise is no guarantee of not providing additional social value, it seems likely that the fact that an organisation is a social enterprise may be a factor in commissioners' considerations under the act.<br>The growth of the social investment market \u2013 however skeptical some of us might be about the way it's currently developing \u2013 is another good reason for 'a social enterprise' to be defined for tax purposes.<br>I think the time has come for clear, inclusive legal definition that enables organisations to register as 'a social enterprise' and be regulated accordingly. </p> </blockquote> <p><br>\u2022 An interesting piece on <strong>mental health and the internet</strong> by Vanessa Bartlett for Mind's blog.

Although I had reached a point where I was ready to start externalising some of my experiences, telling close family and friends how I was really feeling was still too daunting. So I told the internet instead.<br>Two years after starting my blog, I am completing a research qualification where I am considering the value of using online writing to help with mental health issues.

  "<p>It's no real secret that much of the most exciting and innovative game design work is being done in the indie sector these days. While mainstream publishers stack their chips behind safe brands and long running licenses, smaller studios and lone coders are continuing to explore the wider, more surreal possibilities of the medium. </p> <p>The past month in particular has seen an astonishing range of indie releases across all formats and genres. Here are ten examples you should really check out before \u2013 or perhaps instead of \u2013 the Triple A Christmas hits to come.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.markoftheninja.com\">Mark of the Ninja</a> (Xbox Live Arcade)</strong></h2> <p>From the creators of the brilliantly deranged brawler, Shank, this stealth platformer is effectively every eighties Ninja flick rolled into one engrossing adventure. Players must traverse a series of environments, using firecrackers to distract enemies, crawling through vents, avoiding guard dogs and killing silently with throwing stars. The action is depicted via lovely cell-shaded visuals, the complex background designs bringing a real sense of depth to the single plain gameplay. If you thought Shadow Complex was the pinnacle of scrolling 2D gameplay on Xbox 360, you may need to think again.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.smudgedcat.com/gateways.htm\">Gateways</a> (PC, Xbox 360)</strong></h2> <p>If you loved Portal 2 and have already finished Kim Swift's ideological follow-up, Quantum Conundrum, this is the one for you. Gateways is a 2D platformer in which a mad scientist must escape his lab using a gateway gun that shoots traversable portals onto flat surfaces. Instead of simply cribbing Valve's masterful physics puzzler, however, developer Smudged Cat has added a range of different guns, including one that shrinks or enlarges the inventor as he passes through and another that allows him to time travel. It's mind bending stuff, wonderfully designed to inhabit one enormous level and a real treat for gamers seeking a well-crafted intellectual challenge. Available on PC via Steam or Desura, and on the Xbox Live Indie Games service.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://superhexagon.com/\">Super Hexagon</a> (iOS)</strong></h2> <p>Game writers are calling this the cruellest game ever made, but Terry Cavanagh's minimalist blipvert of a puzzler is also magical in its Zen-like purity. The set up is simple \u2013 you control an arrow as it rotates left and right, trying to find the small gaps in a series of incoming hexagons; if the walls of the shape touch you, you're dead. That's it. Sessions are frantic, chaotic and confusing, often lasting little more than a few seconds, but you'll be compelled to continue because this is effectively game design compulsion at its most cleanly distilled. The pulsating visuals and rousing chiptune soundtrack add to the almost hypnotic onslaught, and the global leader board will compel fanatics to continue through the rage barrier. This game made Guardian contributor Simon Parkin so angry, he <a href=\"http://www.hookshotinc.com/exposing-super-hexagon-creators-lies-investigative-journalism-special/\">wrote a fictional revenge drama</a> in response. Few games do that to people. </p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://hermitgames.com/qrthphyl.php\">Qrth-Phyl</a></strong> (PC, Xbox)</h2> <p>Indie coder Matt James wrote the conceptually wonderful Leave Home, a shooter about growing up and coming of age. Now he has re-invented the Nokia classic Snake (or if your influences go back further, Blockade) for a new age. In this mesmerising puzzler, available on PC and the Xbox Live Indie Games service, you control a sort of snake-like space craft as it gobbles energy balls on a series of hallucinogenic space platforms, growing larger with every meal. Hit a wall or your own tail and you lose a life, finish off enough dots and you open up a new realm. The visuals swap between 2D planes and 3D environs, and the levels are emergent, building themselves on the fly so the challenge is different every time. It's just so clever and so gorgeous to look at, and it is as challenging to play as the title is to pronounce. </p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.retroaffect.com/games/1/Snapshot/\">Snapshot</a> (PC)</strong></h2> <p>The latest masterwork from indie gaming prodigy <a href=\"http://kpulv.com/\">Kyle Pulver</a> is a neat puzzle platformer featuring a super cute robot whose camera can capture objects and then re-materialise them in other places.

That's essentially the idea behind Mike Bithell's blocky odyssey following a collection of sentient sprites as they navigate the interior of a computer, forming friendships along the way. In a way, it's another platformer, but featuring a rather touching narration from Danny Wallace it somehow becomes a somewhat cinematic quest, touching and funny, and still functioning perfectly as an abstract puzzle. Not bad for an idea that Bithell originally developed and prototyped in just 24 hours. </p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://blendogames.com/thirtyflightsofloving/\">Thirty Flights of Loving</a> (PC)</strong></h2> <p>Big Triple A titles like Uncharted and Call of Duty aspire to cinema through their use of narrative sequences and epic visuals, but they rarely engage with the form and methodology of the medium. This surreal first-person heist game, which can be played and completed in barely 15 minutes, does amazingly clever things with editing and character perspective, grabbing players from the first moment to the fade out, despite the lack of dialogue and the expressionistic design. Play this game now because in years to come people may point back and say that's where video game story telling changed forever.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://closuregame.com\">Closure</a> (PC)</strong></h2> <p>Developed by a three-man team at Eyebrow Interactive, this creepy monochrome puzzler has you controlling a weird alien creature that must navigate a junk-strewn underworld using light beams as traversable pathways. Nothing in this environment exists while in dark, and plunging into the inky blackness means death, so everything from locating and manipulating objects, to reaching the end of each stage is governed by how you manipulate light. It's atmospheric and deliciously gothic, reminding some of Playdead's Limbo; and out there in the void, there is a strange story to uncover...</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.noogy.com/main.html\">Dust: An Elysian Tail</a> (Xbox Live Arcade)</strong></h2> <p>Released in mid-August to huge critical acclaim, Dust is an ambitious action RPG crafted by one coder, Dean Dodrill, who took over three years to complete it. Eponymous hero Dust must traverse a beautiful hand-drawn world, battling enemies and gaining XP. Hardly revolutionary stuff, of course, but the intricate yet accessible combat system and lavish environments really set this apart from conventional mainstream RPG hits. A true spiritual progeny of Castlevania and Metroid.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.weareminority.com/\">Papo and Yo</a> (PlayStation Network)</strong></h2> <p>Very few video games are autobiographical, and few attempt to deal with real-life tragedy or trauma. The beguiling adventure title Papo and Yo, however, handles both. It is effectively about creator Vander Caballero's childhood with an alcoholic and abusive father \u2013 except in the game, the father is a monster who must be controlled and tamed by the lead character so that he is no longer a danger to his friends. It is a game that's both emotionally fascinating and utterly compelling as a ludic experience. It is the anti-Call of Duty. At times it represents what everyone in the industry must aspire to if people are going to refer to games as an artform without others sniggering derisively.</p>",
  "<p>The United States is beset by four deficits: a fiscal deficit, a jobs deficit, a deficit in public investment, and an opportunity deficit. The budget proposals put forward by the presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan, could reduce the fiscal deficit, but would exacerbate the other three.</p> <p>To be sure, Romney and Ryan have failed to provide specifics about how they would reduce the fiscal deficit, relying on \"trust me\" assertions. But the overarching direction of their proposals is clear: more tax cuts, disproportionately benefiting those at the top, coupled with significantly lower non-defence discretionary spending, disproportionately hurting everybody else \u2013 and weakening the economy's growth prospects.</p> <p>Despite 30 months of private-sector job growth, the US still confronts a large jobs deficit. The unemployment rate remains more than two percentage points above the \"normal\" rate (when the economy is operating near capacity). Moreover, the labour-force participation rate remains near historic lows.</p> <p>More than 11m additional jobs are needed to return the US to its pre-recession employment level. At the current pace of recovery, that is more than eight years away. In the meantime, persistent high unemployment reduces the economy's growth potential by robbing today's workers of skills and experience.</p> <p>When weak aggregate demand causes the economy to operate far below its potential, cuts in government spending enlarge the jobs deficit. Indeed, in his recent speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, the US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke warned that such cuts significantly inhibit job creation.</p> <p>Without revealing which programmes he would reduce, Romney promises to slash federal spending by more than $500bn in 2016, capping it at 20% of GDP thereafter. He also promises an immediate 5% cut in non-defence discretionary spending in 2013, on top of the huge cuts already scheduled to take effect. And he has ruled out additional temporary fiscal measures aimed at job creation, like President Barack Obama's proposals for additional grants to states and additional infrastructure spending.</p> <p>Romney acknowledges that large spending cuts, along with the scheduled expiration of tax cuts at the end of this year, could throw the economy back into recession in 2013. But he vows to steer the economy from the fiscal cliff by extending the tax cuts enacted under George W Bush, doubling down with a further 20% across-the-board cut in income-tax rates and cutting the corporate rate from 35% to 25%.</p> <p>With the possible exception of the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts, these changes would take considerable time to implement. Even when enacted, their near-term effects on job creation would be minimal. An across-the-board reduction in tax rates performs poorly in terms of budgetary effectiveness (the number of jobs created per dollar of foregone revenue). Payroll-tax relief and spending on programmes like food stamps and unemployment compensation are much more effective.</p> <p>Romney overstates his tax proposals' long-term growth effects as well. Reducing individual tax rates and taxes on savings and investment at best fosters modest increases in employment, work effort, and income. Despite the Bush-era tax cuts, the 2001-2007 expansion was the worst of the post-war period in terms of investment, employment, wage, and GDP growth. Job creation and growth were much stronger following President Bill Clinton's tax increases in the 1990s.</p> <p>Moreover, if all of Romney's additional tax cuts were financed in a revenue-neutral way, as he promises, only the composition of taxes would change; the overall tax share of GDP would not. There is no evidence that this would significantly boost growth, as Romney claims.</p> <p>Based on what Romney has told us, we can conclude that his plan would exacerbate the public-investment deficit as well. Romney's vow to cap federal spending at 20% of GDP by 2016, while maintaining defence spending at 4% of GDP and leaving both Social Security and Medicare unchanged for those 55 or older, implies exempting more than 50% of government spending from cuts for the next decade. So, to hit the 20% cap, spending on everything else would have to be slashed by an average of roughly 40% by 2016 and 57% by 2022.</p> <p>Everything else includes government investments in three major areas on which growth and high-wage jobs depend: education, infrastructure, and research. These areas account for less than 8% of federal spending, and their share has been declining steadily. Under Romney, it would plummet to new lows.</p> <p>Everything else also includes spending on programmes that help low-income families, like food stamps, student grants, and Medicaid. The Centre on Budget and Policy Priorities finds that almost two-thirds of the Ryan budget's spending cuts would come from such programmes. Romney offers few specifics, but simple arithmetic shows that his plan would require even deeper cuts in these programmes than Ryan's plan would.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Romney's plan would actually increase taxes on middle-income families. His plan would pay for lower income-tax rates by eliminating tax deductions like those for charitable giving and mortgages, while maintaining tax preferences for saving and investment. But there are not enough tax breaks for the rich to cover another 20% reduction in their income-tax rate. That is why the nonpartisan Tax Policy Centre found that Romney's plan would cut overall taxes for households with incomes above $200,000, but would require an average annual tax increase of at least $2,000 for households with incomes between $100,000 and $200,000.</p> <p>Romney's budget plan would also make the federal tax-and-transfer system considerably less progressive, thereby worsening income inequality, which is already at its highest level since the Great Depression. Rising income inequality fuels a growing opportunity deficit for children born into poor and middle-income families, reflected in disparities in educational attainment by family background, and a decline in intergenerational mobility. Under Romney, the opportunity deficit would widen, robbing the country of future talent and productivity.</p> <p>Romney has provided few details about his deficit-reduction plan. But, based on what he has revealed, we know that it would increase the jobs deficit, the investment deficit, and the opportunity deficit, with negative consequences for future growth and prosperity.</p> <p>\u2022 Laura Tyson, a former chair of the US president's Council of Economic Advisers, is a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.</p> <p>\u00a9 <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/\" title=\"\">Project Syndicate</a> 1995\u20132012</p>",
  "<p>A judge has dismissed part of a lawsuit by the Velvet Underground, over the rights to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jan/11/velvet-underground-protect-banana-design\" title=\"\">iconic banana image</a> that featured on their debut album. The band were told they do not have a valid copyright claim, though they may continue pursuing the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts for trademark infringement.</p> <p>In January, members of the Velvet Underground filed a lawsuit in New York, alleging that Warhol's banana print on the cover their 1967 album, has become \"a symbol\" of the defunct band. They demanded that Warhol's organisation stop licensing the image for use on goods such as iPod covers, and pay them for past licensing.</p> <p>In response to this suit, the Warhol Foundation issued a binding legal covenant, promising to never sue the Velvet Underground, or related parties, for copyright infringement. They offered indemnity \"under the current, former, or any future copyright law of the United States \u2026 [and] regardless of whether said claim arises from VU's or any other [related] party's past, current or future conduct\".</p> <p>On Friday, US district court judge Alison Nathan ruled that because of this covenant, there is no longer a copyright dispute. \"Without a specific dispute over imminent activity, a declaratory judgment here would simply be 'an opinion advising what the law would be under a hypothetical state of facts,'\" <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/105511778?access_key=key-qgubyzswxlxjvktb76z\" title=\"\">Nathan wrote</a> (via the <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/velvet-underground-lawsuit-andy-warhol-foundation-369103\" title=\"\">Hollywood Reporter</a>). \"The [US] Constitution gives this court no power to issue such an opinion.\"</p> <p>It is still not clear who is the legal rights-holder for the banana design: Nathan has simply ruled that for the moment, it's irrelevant. The Velvet Underground can only proceed with the trademark aspect of their case, arguing that the Foundation's use of the banana causes \"confusion as to \u2026 affiliation, approval or sponsorship\" by the group.</p> <p>The Warhol Foundation has responded by pointing to the fact that the Velvet Underground broke up in 1972. Trademarks are apparently only relevant if they are linked to an ongoing business, and the group is scarcely a going concern. According to court papers, it has been 11 years since the band last licensed the banana image, for an Absolut Vodka advert.</p> <p>Last month, in what may have been a related move, the Velvet Underground <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/26/velvet-underground-first-album-reissue\" title=\"\">announced plans</a> to reissue The Velvet Underground and Nico on 1 October.</p>",
  "<p>If there's a special relationship between the UK and the US, then talking points about reproductive health are like STDs: once the contagion has been incubated on the American side, it's sure to be transmitted to us in time. We caught the kerbside vigils, we got the disingenuous chatter about the \"abortion industry\" and soon we're going to suffer from something new. The very latest in the fight to make sure ladies get up the duff and stay up the duff shifts the argument away from whether women have the right to end their pregnancies should they choose to, and on to the question of whether they have a right to avoid getting pregnant in the first place.</p> <p>It's not framed as a question of rights, of course. It's framed as a question of costs \u2013 because you can argue about ethics all you like, but money is its own argument and absolute. That's the tack taken by <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/declarations.html\" title=\"\">Peggy Noonan in the Wall Street Journal</a> on Sandra Fluke's appearance at the Democratic National Convention. (Fluke, you'll remember, is the American student who was labelled a \"slut\" and a \"prostitute\" by the ever-gentlemanly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/mar/02/barack-obama-condemns-rush-limbaugh-slut-remarks\" title=\"\">Rush Limbaugh</a> because she campaigned for contraceptives to be covered by insurers.)</p> <p>\"She really does think \u2013 and her party apparently thinks \u2013 that in a spending crisis with trillions in debt and many in need, in a nation in existential doubt as to its standing and purpose, in a time when parents struggle to buy the good sneakers for the kids so they're not embarrassed at school \u2026 that in <em>that</em> nation [author's italics] the great issue of the day, and the appropriate focus of our concern, is making other people pay for her birth-control pills,\" writes Noonan, as if a course of oral contraceptives were a delicious sugar-coated snack and Fluke was selfishly dipping into the public pocket for the cost of her candy. (Personally, I'd say that a nation in \"existential doubt\" really doesn't need a lot of unplanned babies to worry about as well.)</p> <p>Noonan's keen on price tags, so let's get the sticker gun out and apply some more numbers to contraception and childbirth. Having a baby is expensive, whether you can stretch to the superior make of trainers or not. Even if you kept your kids in plimsolls (\u00a39 a pair when I was doing the annual ritual of levering out a kidney and splatting it on the counter of the school uniform shop last week), you'd still have to stump up for the rest of the food, the clothes, the housing that children are inconvenient enough to need.</p> <p>But that's all still a personal cost to the parents, so by Noonan's logic contraception could still be lumped back onto women as a long-term saving. There's more, though: having a baby blows a massive hole in <a href=\"http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/25/rich-mom-poor-mom/\" title=\"\">women's earnings</a> and the less money you have to start with, the worse the motherhood penalty is. That's a loss to individuals; it's also a loss to the economy as a whole. Helping women to time their pregnancies helps them to stay employed after they've become mothers. I see that as allowing women to maintain their independence and dignity, but if it's more palatable to Noonan, she could always imagine them as \"continuously productive economic units\" rather than \"people\".</p> <p>And of course, there are the healthcare costs of being pregnant and delivering a baby \u2013 which American insurers are unsurprisingly <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40201197/ns/health-health_care/t/pregnancy-not-covered-most-individual-health-policies/#.UE3k1bJlQ_w%20as%20well.%20According%20to%20a%202005%20report%20by%20the%20National%20Institute%20of%20Clinical%20Excellence%20www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/10974/29916/29916.pdf\" title=\"\">keen to wriggle out of</a>; just moving women from the pill to more-reliable long-acting reversible contraceptives like the implant or coil could save the NHS in England <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicyexchange.co.uk/docs/8J02-PPE_Jacquie_Rowlands.pdf\" title=\"\">about \u00a3100</a>m per year. That's loads of money saved simply by moving from a good method to a really good one. Now imagine how much money the NHS saves by offering some contraception rather than none at all and you'll see a figure astronomically greater.</p> <p>The ability to control fertility is a usually seen as a victory for women, but that's too narrow: the revolution in fertility is a victory for everyone, male or female, parents or childfree. Personally I'm amazed that men haven't cottoned on to the joy of sex without the risk of a surprise baby and started to clamour for their own version of the implant. (Seriously, guys, it's amazing; and you get to pretend you're bionic when you feel the magic plastic stick just below the skin of your arm.) If someone tells you contraception is too expensive, the first thing they're telling you is that they're not very good at maths; the second, that they think we can afford to go back to a time when women were just mothers-in-waiting rather than people in their own right.</p>",
  "<p>A French hiker who was one of the first to reach the forest clearing where a British family was murdered has described how the seven-year-old girl, who was shot, badly beaten and left for dead at the scene, showed no signs of life.</p> <p>The witness, Philippe Didierjean, 41, said: \"She wasn't responding to our calls. I clapped my hands but she did not respond. I even spoke a few words in English, because I saw the car was registered in Great Britain, but there was nothing. To me, she was dead.\"</p> <p>He then went back down the hill leading to the Alpine beauty spot near Lake Annecy to call the emergency services. They discovered the Iraqi-born British engineer Saad al-Hilli, 50, his dentist wife, Iqbal, 47, and her 74-year-old mother dead from bullet wounds in the car. Each of the victims had been shot twice in the head.</p> <p>The body of a French cyclist who had been shot seven times, twice in the head, was found nearby.</p> <p>The first person to discover the horror was a British former Royal Air Force pilot who was cycling up La Route de Combe d'Ire, near the village of Chevaline, last Wednesday.</p> <p>The man, who has a house in the area, arrived at the car park at the top of the hill and saw a British-registered BMW with its windows shot out and the motor still running. The Hillis' eldest daughter, Zainab, staggered towards him, covered in blood, and collapsed at his feet.</p> <p>Didierjean, 41, told Le Parisien newspaper he had been hiking up the Combe d'Ire with two friends when he noticed the British cyclist coming down at speed: \"He was in a panic and was coming down the route. He explained to me with difficulty in bad French that there had been a drama a little higher up. He wanted to alert the emergency services.</p> <p>\"I wasn't sure whether he didn't have a mobile telephone or he couldn't get a signal up there.\"</p> <p>Didierjean said he followed the British cyclist for a few metres before arriving at the car park. \"I approached the car. I didn't touch anything, but I saw at once that there was nothing more to be done. There was no sign of life.\" He said he heard no shooting and \"seen nobody passing&#xa0;\u2026 not a car or motorbike\".</p> <p>Police took statements from all four \u2013 including the RAF officer \u2013 and took them back up the Combe d'Ire at the weekend to determine exactly where they were when the killers struck.</p> <p>Didierjean said: \"A few minutes earlier and it could have been us in place of the murdered cyclist. We didn't know&#xa0;\u2026 if we were in danger or not \u2013 if those who had done all that were still there or not. It felt like we were taking a risk.\"</p> <p>It emerged on Tuesday that French investigators were looking at claims Saad al-Hilli unexpectedly moved his family from one campsite to another two days before the attack.</p> <p>A Dutch couple who had a neighbouring caravan said they believed the family had been planning to spend a week at the three-star Village Camping Europa site in Saint-Jorioz, but left after just two nights.</p> <p>The campers said Saad al-Hilli had acted \"strangely\" during the stay, going off and leaving his family alone several times a day. There were also reports of an \"eastern European looking man\" wearing a smart jacket visiting the Hillis.</p> <p>The family moved to Le Solitaire du Lac campsite, on the banks of Lake Annecy, where investigators said they had stayed in previous years.</p> <p>A member of staff at Village Camping Europe denied the family had left suddenly. She said: \"They came to stay with us on Saturday evening and left on Monday. That was pre-planned.\"</p> <p>She dismissed suggestions that Hilli behaved oddly during his stay: \"There was nothing strange. All families leave the campsite at all sorts of times to run errands, go to the shop, organise activities, that sort of thing.\"</p> <p>She said comments about a mysterious man described as appearing \"to come from the Balkans\" were \"ridiculous\". She said: \"That was an Italian man who was here. He left and got on his plane, as was planned.\"</p> <p>Zainab al-Hilli, who was shot and so brutally beaten that doctors placed her in a medically induced coma, is conscious but heavily sedated.</p> <p>She is said to have indicated to relatives at her bedside that she is aware of what happened, but she has not yet been questioned by French investigators, who are waiting for doctors to declare her well enough to speak of her ordeal. She is under armed guard as a key witness.</p> <p>Her four-year-old sister, Zeena, escaped unhurt by huddling in the footwell of the rear of the car under her dead mother's legs, where she lay terrified for eight hours before being discovered.</p> <p>French police are examining two mobile phones found in the car and are understood to be examining the hard disk of a laptop.</p> <p>British police are working with French officers to try to unravel the mystery surrounding the four deaths. The public prosecutor at Annecy, Eric Maillaud, has announced a press conference for 5pm on Wednesday (4pm BST).</p> <p>Afterwards, Maillaud and one of the investigating judges appointed to oversee the inquiry will travel to London to meet the four gendarmes working with British police to find clues.</p> <p>Doctors at Grenoble University Hospital have said it will be several days before Zainab can be interviewed.</p> <p>French law requires that any questioning of Zainab is filmed, but the interview will be carried out by gendarmes who are specialists in dealing with children.</p> <p>Maillaud explained to French journalists: \"The idea is to bring the child to say things without asking them too many questions.</p> <p>\"Too often, a child wants to please and has a tendency to say 'yes' because they think it will please if they say 'yes'.

  "<p>The Conservative party needs to learn a lesson from Margaret Thatcher and re-establish itself as a broad church if David Cameron is to win an overall parliamentary majority, according to the former defence secretary Liam Fox.</p> <p>Fox, who was speaking at the launch of the new centre-right Conservative Voice group, said the party must play host to a broad \"internal\" coalition of competing views if it is to avoid being forced to form an \"external\" coalition in future.</p> <p>Along with the former shadow home secretary David Davis, Fox was one of two former Tory leadership contenders who attended the launch of Conservative Voice, which has been formed to reach out to what the group calls \"aspirational voters\".</p> <p>The group, the brainchild of the former head of the party's voluntary wing, Don Porter, who is supported by the founder of <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/\" title=\"\">ConservativeHome</a>, Tim Montgomerie, was initially designed to put a brake on Cameron's modernisation of the Tory brand.</p> <p>But at the launch of the group Porter and other supporters, including the new MPs Dom Raab and Steve Barclay, modified their criticism of Cameron by saying they were simply ensuring that a Conservative view could be promoted while the party shares power with the Liberal Democrats.</p> <p>Fox, who is seen as one of the party's heirs of Thatcher, said the Tories needed to learn from the former prime minister who led a broad coalition in her first term. Thatcher's first cabinet was famously dominated by \"wets\", such as the Foreign Office minister Sir Ian Gilmour and the employment secretary, Jim Prior, who strongly disagreed with her monetarist economic policies.</p> <p>Fox told the Guardian: \"In our political tradition we have avoided external coalitions by maintaining internal coalitions. The wider the spectrum within the party the more likely we are to reach that critical mass of voters that gives us a majority.</p> <p>\"So it is not a question of shifting the Tory party artificially to the right or to the left to suit what is perceived to be the views of the electorate at any one time. It is about widening the appeal of the Conservative party to ensure we are able to reach all voters in all regions of all backgrounds in a way that, certainly in the last couple of decades, we have not been able to do. That is why we have not formed a majority government.</p> <p>\"After Thatcher's first win we did have our widest coalition. That is what the Conservative party needs to understand. When we represent the widest possible range of the British public, that is when we are at our strongest. In recent years we have failed to connect with the aspirational voters \u2013 those who are trying just to achieve something a little better. We need to reconnect with all those people.</p> <p>\"When I joined the Conservative party in the west of Scotland [in the 1970s] you didn't do it because you wanted a career. But at that time the Tory party was genuinely offering people from whatever background the opportunity to prosper and achieve whatever by their own efforts.</p> <p>\"We need to get back to some of those concepts as a party. Politics is not just about policy. It is not just about what you are saying on any one issue on any one day. It is also about the wider beliefs you have and the wider impression you create among the voters about what it is you stand for, not just what you are actually going to do.\"</p> <p>The launch of the new group shows the frustration among many Tories on the centre-right at the constraints of the coalition. This was forced on the Conservatives, in their view, after Cameron's failure to reach out to aspirational voters by concentrating too much attention on metropolitan voters.</p> <p>Porter expressed this view in <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/9194154/The-Tory-party-has-lost-sight-of-its-true-values.html\" title=\"\">a Daily Telegraph article in April</a>. \"In recent times, there has been an almost evangelical focus on the 'modernisation' or 'detoxification' of the Conservative brand. The result has been a growing disconnect between the party leadership and the grassroots, and a loss of clarity, principle and policy direction.\"</p> <p>Davis told the launch that he accepted Porter's invitation to support the group for three reasons. \"One was the fact that all political parties today are shrinking. Second, when I had my byelection, we raised \u00a380,000. Apart from one big donation of \u00a310,000 we raised the rest in fivers and tenners online. The third is the campaign I have been running on the snoopers' charter. It took three days online to get 130,000 people signed up to a petition.</p> <p>\"These two latter [examples] used online techniques. But they wouldn't have worked if the message hadn't been there. Clear Conservative messages have appeals far, far beyond the Conservative party. Partly what this [group] is about is trying to get that message across in new ways for all those people who are potential supporters of the Conservative party.\"</p> <p>Porter said the group would help Tory candidates. It has identified the 25 most vulnerable Tory MPs and the 25 most \"aspirational seats\" the Tories must win to form a majority government. This suggests that the group may be hoping to win financial support from Lord Ashcroft, who has sunk some of his fortune into marginal seats in recent elections.</p>",

  "<p>In the UK, the history of regulation, certainly regulation of the media, is one in which, time and again, successive governments lacked the \"bottle\" to enforce the powers that were available to them.</p> <p>We saw this 25 years ago with Rupert Murdoch's acquisition of the Times and the Sunday Times, when the government wriggled around its obligation to refer the purchase of either newspaper to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, on the grounds that both papers were in imminent danger of closure.</p> <p>As the passage of time has revealed, this was a somewhat exaggerated claim in the case of the Times, and wholly without foundation in respect of the Sunday Times.</p> <p>As a compromise, a set of safeguards regarding \"editorial independence\" were incorporated into the articles of association of Times Newspapers \u2013 which were changeable only with ministerial approval.</p> <p>But those safeguards all too quickly turned to dust; in fact the new proprietor later boasted that they were \"never worth the paper they were written on\".</p> <p>As Harold Evans writes in his book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Good-Times-Bad-Harold-Evans/dp/1857991249\" title=\"\">Good Times, Bad Times</a>, \"when in Murdoch's presence, it was barely possible to believe he would break his word, however away from him, it was barely possible to believe he would keep it.\"</p> <p>For as Rupert Murdoch himself is reported as telling one of his biographers, Thomas Kiernan, in his book Citizen Murdoch, \"you tell these bloody politicians whatever they want to hear, and once the deal is done, you don't worry about it. They're not going to chase after you later.\"</p> <p>That pretty well describes exactly what's been going on over the last quarter of a century here in the UK.</p> <p>In fairness, the rise of social media offers some genuine cause for optimism, not least because it enables people to start speaking the truth directly to power, and in ways that were unimaginable even 10 years ago.</p> <p>At least in the west politicians, corporations and media moguls can no longer take for granted their power to control the public discourse \u2013 and have it go unchallenged.</p> <p>So technologically and socially there can be no going back \u2013 the response to the Queen's diamond jubilee, and the public outpouring of affection that preceded the miracle of the London Olympics, makes it clear that we've reached a watershed in deciding the type of nation we want to be \u2013 and wish to be seen to be.</p> <p>But it's Michael Sandel's recent book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/What-Money-Cant-Buy-Markets/dp/184614471X\" title=\"\">What Money Can't Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets</a>, which took me to the root of this issue.</p> <p>Although his analysis is principally focused on the US; much of what he says translates directly to the Britain that's been bequeathed to us by 25 years of obeisance to the (demonstrably false) gods of the marketplace.</p> <p>Writing in the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/13/opinion/sunday/friedman-this-column-is-not-sponsored-by-anyone.html\" title=\"\">New York Times</a>, one of my favourite columnists, Tom Friedman, summarised the book's key insights like this:</p> <blockquote> Sandel argues that market values are crowding out civic practices. When schools are plastered with commercial advertising, they teach students to be consumers rather than citizens. When we outsource war to private military contractors, and when we have separate, shorter lines for airport security for those who can afford them, the result is that the affluent and those of modest means live increasingly separate lives; and the class-mixing institutions and public spaces that forge a sense of common experience and shared citizenship get eroded. <br> Throughout our society, we are losing the places and institutions that used to bring people together from different walks of life.  Unless the rich and poor encounter one another in everyday life, it's hard to think of ourselves as engaged in a common project.  At a time when to fix our society we need to do big, hard things together, the marketisation of public life becomes one more thing pulling us apart. </blockquote> <p>\"Democracy does not require perfect equality,\" he concludes, \"but it does require that citizens share in a common life \u2026 For this is how we learn to negotiate and abide our differences, and how we come to care for the common good.\"</p> <p>This is something that the most powerful and influential people on both sides of the Atlantic could be accused of having lost sight of over the last three decades.</p> <p>And they've been encouraged to do so by a good deal of the media \u2013 whether it be the Daily Mail or Fox News.</p> <p>However, encouraged by Lord Leveson's forensic investigation and by the spirit of the London Olympics, I'd like to think that we are beginning the process of recovering a sense of common purpose in this country.</p> <p>Lord Leveson and his colleagues have some very difficult and incredibly important judgments to make over the coming months.</p> <p>As I see it, the most important of these is which Britain to go into bat for.

  "<p>Olympic fever gripped the nation to such an extent that no one was betting on any other sports in August, according to online gambling exchange <strong>Betfair</strong>.</p> <p>So after a first quarter boosted by Euro 2012 - with revenues of \u00a37.8m from the tournament helping total sales climb 13% - the company's performance since the end of July has faltered. Second quarter gaming revenues so far have fallen 2%, it said. Finance director Stephen Morana said:</p> <blockquote> A slower start to the football season and reduced interest in other sports during the Olympics resulted in slower revenue growth in August. After a strong first quarter, this leaves year to date revenues in line with our expectations. <br> </blockquote> <p>The company's new chief executive Breon Corcoran joined at the start of August, but he faces a number of challengers. No sooner has he started than Betfair needs to find a new finance director, with Morana announcing his intention to step down once a successor is found.</p> <p>On the trading front, as well as the Olympic effect, the company has seen restrictions on the products it can offer in Spain and Cyprus, while new taxes have been introduced in Germany.</p> <p>After the update, Betfair's shares have dropped 18.5p to 729.5p. James Hollins at Investec repeated his sell recommendation, saying:</p> <blockquote> The shift from a technology-led (David Yu, ex-chief technology officer) to an operations-led chief executive (Breon Corcoran, ex-chief operating officer at Paddy Power) should drive superior levels of cost control and a closer match of ongoing expenses to the reality of Betfair's existing and potential global sports betting footprint. <br> Our aggressively bearish stance has been tempered by the senior management change and the emergence of some clarity on regulation (eg Italy and Spain). However, (1) ongoing legislative/tax risk (eg Germany, Greece and UK), (2) below sector average free cash flow generation, (3) sector premium multiples (25 times 2013 PE versus our gaming sector peers average at 14 times), and (4) a new discounted cash flow-based price target of 625p result in a maintained sell recommendation. </blockquote>",
  "<p><strong>Burberry</strong> has seemed to defy gravity for so long that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/sep/11/burberry-warns-profits-sales-luxury-fashion\" title=\"\">an unexpected warning on profits</a> was bound to send it crashing to earth.</p> <p>The luxury goods group's shares have dropped 248p to \u00a311.27, an 18% decline which makes them by far the biggest faller in the FTSE 100. There had been a nagging concern that the sector could not buck the global downturn forever, and signs of a slowdown in key market China have added to these worries.</p> <p>In the event Burberry said like for like sales in the second quarter were unchanged year on year, with signs of a slowdown in recent weeks. It said it was taking action to manage costs and protect short term profitability. Analysts said it had frozen headcount and travel expenditure, cut marketing spend and deferred IT projects.</p> <p>The news has sent shockwaves throughout the European luxury sector, with <strong>LVMH</strong> down 4.2%, Cucci owner <strong>PPR </strong>4.1% lower and <strong>Richemont</strong>, the maker of Cartier jewellery, down 5%. Back in the UK handbag maker <strong>Mulberry</strong> is off 68p at \u00a312.90, a 5% decline.</p> <p>Analyst Kate Calvert at Seymour Pierce cut her recommendation, saying:</p> <blockquote> The trend Burberry is talking about may seem at odds with the rest of the sector news of late but we note that this is current news up until 8 September and would not be surprised if other luxury players are seeing similar trends. The recent de-rating of the shares has already started to anticipate a slowdown and this slowdown is nothing like the brick wall the sector impacted in 2008 when the financial crisis hit. Indeed, Burberry is in a much stronger position brand and infrastructure wise to react to a slowdown given recent system investment so is unlikely to have the same stock issues. <br> This news will obviously hit sentiment towards Burberry and the luxury sector and the shares are likely to underperform until there is better news on demand so we are cutting our recommendation to hold [from buy]. </blockquote> <p>Bethany Hocking at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> We understand market forecasts are for \u00a3407m-\u00a3455m. We had expected \u00a3440.6m, so for us this represents a downgrade of around 8%. <br> We have been fans of Burberry, and remain of the view that the strategy, luxury positioning and management team should lead to long-term sector outperformance. Today's statement does, however, imply a significant slowdown and Burberry is not immune from wider macro-economic turbulence. We place our forecasts, target price and recommendation under review. </blockquote> <p>Burberry's slump knocked 4 points off an already downbeat <strong>FTSE 100</strong>. The leading index is 20.11 points lower at 5773.09 ahead of the anticipated German court ruling on the European fiscal pact and bailout fund, due tomorrow, and the US Federal Reserve meeting on Thursday.</p> <p>With copper prices easing, investors took some profits from the recent rise in the mining sector. <strong>Anglo American</strong> is down 82p to 1919.5p, while <strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> has fallen 49.5p to 953.5p after India's Goa state said it was temporarily suspending iron ore mining to check if operations there were legal. So Vedanta subsidiary Sesa Goa has stopped ore extraction, and will submit all relevant documents as soon as possible.</p>",
  "<p>Up to a million people are expected to converge on Barcelona to join a rally demanding independence for Catalonia in Spain's north-east.</p> <p>At least one train and more than 1,000 coaches have been chartered to bring supporters to Tuesday evening's march, which is likely to mark a watershed in the hitherto marginal independence movement and a rupture with Spain's federal government.</p> <p>Long-standing resentments about what Catalans see as their unfairly high contribution to central government have been inflamed by Spain's economic woes. Polls show support for independence running at 51%, twice as high as in 2008 when the financial crisis began.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396025448\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/9/11/1347359713425/Catalonia-map-001.png\" alt=\"Catalonia map\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Map of Catalonia </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Carles Brugueras, a documentary film-maker, said he was not a nationalist but favoured independence from an economic perspective. \"For a long time, Catalonia has been generating a lot of resources for Spain but the fiscal balance has been very unfair,\" he said.</p> <p>Laura Nu\u00f1ez, a law student, is also a new convert to independence, believing it would boost the Catalan economy.</p> <p>\"We're economically the most powerful part of Spain because of industry and tourism and we contribute more than other Spanish regions..\"</p> <p>The rise in support for secession has caught Catalonia's nationalist CiU government off guard. CiU, which has governed the region for 25 of the 33 years since democracy was restored after the death of the dictator Franco, has never aspired to independence, preferring to wring more autonomy out of minority governments in Madrid.</p> <p>Artur Mas, the Catalan president, initially said he had no intention of joining the march but now says he will attend in a personal capacity. An attempt by another senior CiU politician to justify his attendance at the rally by portraying it as pro-Catalan rather than pro-independence fell flat when Carme Forcadell, spokeswoman for the group behind the march, said: \"Anyone who attends should understand that they will be considered pro-independence.\"</p> <p>Catalonia is one of 17 autonomous regions in Spain's federal system, which has come under attack from, among others, the European Central Bank, who have questioned the system's viability. Most of the regions have been run as virtual fiefdoms by local politicians hand in hand with the savings banks, almost of all of which are now bankrupt. Earlier this month, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/28/catalonias-plea-brings-spanish-bailout-nearer\" title=\"\">Catalonia asked Madrid for a \u20ac5bn (\u00a34bn) bailout</a>, while claiming that it was only asking for what was rightfully its own in the first place.</p> <p>There is considerable antipathy in Spain towards the Catalans, who are often viewed as complaining and, from a Spanish point of view, disloyal. Catalans are, understandably, hurt by this. \"I'm fed up with the way we're criticised whatever we do,\" said Gemma Soler, a secretary. \"And I'm tired of having to justify myself wherever I go in the peninsula, that we're not the extremists they make us out to be, as if we went around burning cars and flags all the time.\"</p> <p>Montse Agell, who works for a charitable foundation, said one of the reasons she was pro-independence was that \"basically, I don't want to live among people who don't like me\".</p>",
  "<p>Bernard Arnault, the fourth richest man in the world, and the richest man in France as a result of the wealth he has made from selling luxury goods to the world's mega rich, is, according to press reports, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/9530638/Bernard-Arnault-Frances-richest-man-applies-to-be-Belgian.html\" title=\"\">applying for Belgian nationality</a>.</p> <p>The media are <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/french-fashion-tycoons-threat-to-move-shakes-socialist-govts-plan-to-tax-rich-at-75-percent/2012/09/10/486efb68-fb51-11e1-98c6-ec0a0a93f8eb_story.html\" title=\"\">making much of this</a>, suggesting that a <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/10/opinion/arnault-france-tax-rate/index.html\" title=\"\">flight of the wealthy</a> is about to happen and Arnault may be just the first of many to leave France as a result of the new higher rate taxes targeted specifically at the wealthy that President Hollande is introducing. That, however is both simplistic and quite possibly wrong.</p> <p>It could be wrong because Arnault says it is. Now, believing a wealthy person's PR on tax can often be a mistake but in this case it seems there may be merit to his claim. If Arnault keeps French tax residency, as he claims, then he is still going to be paying tax there.</p> <p>Furthermore, let's be clear, in Europe tax residence has nothing to do with citizenship. It has in the US, where having the passport means paying tax as the membership fee, but elsewhere that's not the case. Arnault's claim that this has nothing to do with tax may therefore have credibility in that case. He could in fact simply lose his French tax residence by leaving that country and following its tax rules for doing so without ever having to become a citizen elsewhere. So the Belgian passport looks like it could be a tax red herring, not least because he would almost certainly do better by becoming a British non-domiciled person with a French passport instead of going to Belgium if tax was his real motive.</p> <h2>So what is this story really about? </h2> <p>1. The press doesn't understand tax very well: the hype could be about nothing at all.</p> <p>2. It may be that the press know that but are running the story anyway. The story that the \"wealth creators\" are fleeing is a rightwing media staple designed to spread fear amongst those who first believe people like Arnault are wealth creators and second who that where these people live somehow influences where they create jobs as if it were still essential to live above the shop if you are going to invest in it.</p> <p>3. It is about ensuring that the true way in which the wealthy hide their wealth from tax remains hidden behind such simple tales.</p> <h2>So how do ultra high net worth people like Arnault hide their wealth from tax? </h2> <p>1. By using corporations and all the tax breaks that go with them. Remember, most of Arnault's wealth comes from owning shares in a company. The money is not in his own hands, but in his companies, and that fact is that the world over, companies enjoy massive tax breaks he need do nothing but own the company to enjoy; they're his company's by right in a tax system stacked against ordinary people.</p> <p>2. The wealthy try to keep their ownership of wealth as far removed from themselves as possible for tax whilst retaining effective control for all other purposes. This is still where trusts, foundations and offshore companies still have a massive role to play in hiding where wealth is. As the <a href=\"http://www.taxjustice.net/cms/upload/pdf/Price_of_Offshore_Revisited_120722.pdf\" title=\"\">Tax Justice Network noted in July</a>, maybe \u00a313.5 trillion of wealth might be hidden offshore in this way.</p> <p>3. Only when absolutely essential do the ultra wealthy move, and the number of occasions when this really happens can be counted on the fingers of a few hands of late. That's because, to be candid, options one and two for escaping tax are so effective really moving is usually pointless for the ultra rich: the world's tax system is laden with tax loopholes for their use.</p> <h2>So do we really need to worry about a new tax exodus from France, or the UK come to that? </h2> <p>The answer is no. First, it's unlikely for the reasons noted. Second, it's unlikely because candidly the wealth of the ultra wealthy has already gone to tax havens; there's little reason for the owner to follow. And third, these people don't create wealth, they just own it. They're dependent upon real people doing real work in real places serving real people in real places like the UK to make the wealth for them. So they have to leave the jobs behind here in the UK if they flee for tax because without jobs on the ground the ultra wealthy people would rapidly become worthless. They, and the media, just don't want you to realise that.</p>",

I cried a little bit on the court. You're not sad; you're incredibly happy. You have a bit of disbelief because when I have been in that position many times before and not won, you do think, is it ever going to happen?</p> <p>\"It was an incredibly tough match. Relief is probably the word I would use describe how I'm feeling just now. Mentally, the last three, four days have been pretty tiring. When the conditions have been like they have been, you need to focus so hard on almost every shot because the ball is very hard to control.\"</p> <p>He said he did not think about Fred Perry on match point, but he was aware of the significance of his achievement. \"When I was serving for the match, there was a sense of how big a moment that is in British tennis history,\" he said. \"More than most British players, I have been asked about it many times when I got close to winning grand slams before.</p> <p>\"It's great to have finally done it. I hope it inspires some kids to play tennis and also that it takes away the notion that British tennis players choke or don't win - or it's not a good sport. Tennis is in a very good place in the UK right now. Laura [Robson] has done very well. The Olympics [where he won gold and he and Robson won silver in the mixed doubles] was great for us. Liam Broady was in the final here in the juniors. It's in a good place. I hope it stays that way.\"</p> <p>He admitted he was worried before the match whether he could deliver on his own and the nation's expectations.</p> <p>\"I was still doubting myself right up to a few minutes before I went on to play the match. You're thinking, are you going to be able to do this? This is going to be tough. I have been in this position many times and not managed to get through.\"</p> <p>Murray said he struggled also with his response to victory. \"I'm thinking a lot just now,\" he said. \"I'm thinking a lot about a lot of different things. It's hard to explain. It's been a long, long journey. I don't know if it's disbelief or whatever. I'm very, very happy on the inside; I'm sorry if I'm not showing it as you would like.\"</p> <p>He was also at pains to deny rumours that he was about to marry his long-time partner, Kim Sears, saying, \"Well, I don't have any plans for it just now.\"</p> <p>As for the ghost he had just laid, Murray said he had never met Perry but, \"It would have been nice to have spoken to someone from Britain who had won majors before. I used to wear his clothing line when I was growing up. I'm sure he's smiling from up there that someone has finally managed to do it from Britain. I'm very, very happy, and I just hope I hope I can see another British player in my lifetime win a grand slam.\"</p> <p>He revealed his taciturn coach Ivan Lendl had given him a hug later. \"I saw the guys in the locker room afterwards, and I saw him. He just said, I'm proud of you; well done. We had a hug. Then someone sprayed champagne all down my back and over him. I think it was Danny Vallverdu [Murray's long-time hitting partner]. That kind of ended that. He started swearing.\"</p> <p>As for where this historic victory leaves him, as a person and a player, Murray said, \"I hope it doesn't change me as a person. That would be a bad thing. On the court, hopefully if I get into situations like this in the future I won't be having all the doubts that I was having before the match today.</p> <p>\"[But] I'm still going to have all the same friends and family and stay in the same house and train in the same places. There may be a few more busy press conferences and a few more demands on my time, but that's part of the job and that's worth it.\"</p> <p>As for his legacy, he said \"I'm very happy to be part of this era in tennis. I think everyone here would agree it's one of the best ever. Playing against [Nadal, Federer and Djokovic] has made me improve so much. I always said that maybe if I played another era I would have won more, but I wouldn't have been as good a tennis player.</p> <p>\"That's how you should be judged at the end of your career, not just on how much you're winning but on the people you're competing against and how good a player you actually were. Those guys are some of the best of all time.\"</p> <p>He admitted he, \"didn't always listen to all my coaches\", when he was coming up. \"I was very immature some times on the court. I have tried to improve that side of things. Proving that to myself is probably the most pleasing part about tonight, because there are times when I didn't know if I was going to be able to do it.\"</p>",

The TUC is also expected to back a motion to explore the \u201cpracticalities\u201d of staging a general strike.

These hearings are supposed to perform an investigatory function, allowing MPs to find out what happened and why, but this morning Glenys Stacey, the Ofqual chief regulator, splatted the committee with gobbledygook. I certainly found it hard to follow what she was saying and, although it's quite possible that I was being dim, I did get the impression that members of the committee did not have a forensic understanding of what she was saying either.&#xa0;</p> <p>But it was not entirely hopeless. You always learn something during these hearings and today was no exception. Here are the main points.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Ofqual has admitted that it contacted two exam boards, Edexcel and WJEC, because it thought their English results were too high.</strong> Stacey said there was a particular problem with Edexcel.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Edexcel - the preliminary results were high. If the provisional results had been left to stand I think we were looking at 6% or 7% inflation and I suspect there would have been a different outcry had that been the outcome. They were certainly out of line with the other awarding body results.</p> </blockquote> <p>She said that Edexcel accepted Ofqual's demand for it to raise its grade boundaries. If Edexcel had refused, Ofqual could have forced it to comply she said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Ofqual has said that it was surprised that schools had such high expectations for their GCSE English results this year.</strong> The point was made by Amanda Spielman, the Ofqual chair.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You might have thought that this year, in the first year of a completely different exam, schools would be a bit more cautious about their predictions and have brought them down a bit. I\u2019m not saying it is the schools\u2019 fault, I\u2019m saying school expectations were in a very different place. We would have expected in the face of a new specification to see schools being more cautious and what we actually saw was that school expectations for Cs went up by 2%.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Ofqual has said that further education colleges were hit particularly hard by the decision to toughen grade boundaries in GCSE English.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Ofqual's chair has said that t<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/gcses-will-be-regraded-for-pupils-in-wales--but-ofqual-refuses-to-reassess-the-grades-in-england-8122408.html\">he Welsh government decided to regrade its English papers</a> for political reasons.</strong> It was embarrassing for them to accept poor results, Spielman said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Ofqual has said that it is wiling to release details of all its correspondence and calls with the Department for Education, including Michael Gove and his advisers.</strong> There was no political interference in its decision to toughen grade boundaries, Stacey said.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-11T11:46:34.334Z\">at 12.46pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-504f1bd858f94f441baa7a3e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-11T11:09:14.076Z\">12.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Times Educational Supplement has now published in full<a href=\"http://www.tes.co.uk/tesassets/images/resources/Ofqual_Edexcel_Documents_2012.pdf\"> the leaked letters (pdf)</a> that formed the basis of <a href=\"http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storyCode=6289695\">its story saying Ofqual ordered Edexcel to raise its grade boundaries.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-504f1addc0e312b4deaa4803\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-11T11:05:02.140Z\">12.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ofqual submitted written evidence to the education committee before this morning's hearing. I have not seen it yet, but the Press Association has filed a story based on what it says. Here's an excerpt.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The GCSE English grading fiasco has had a \"serious impact on perceptions of fairness\", Ofqual admitted today. <br>The exams regulator said it recognised the significance of the issues faced this summer, and the impact of the \"generous\" results awarded earlier this year. <br>In a written submission to MPs, Ofqual also said that nobody could have seen that January's results were too generous, and that all the evidence pointed towards decisions being harsh. <br>And it insisted that there has been no political interference in the exams. <br>The submission, sent to the Commons education select committee ahead of today's evidence session, sets out Ofqual's investigation so far into this summer's GCSE English grading crisis. <br>It says that, in general, the awarding of modular GCSEs - in which pupils sit exams and submit coursework over a two-year period - has been successful. <br>But this was not the case with new modular English GCSEs, which were awarded for the first time this year. <br>\"We recognise the significance of the issues with GCSE English this summer: the generosity of the awards in assessments taken before June 2012 has had a serious impact on perceptions of fairness at qualification level,\" Ofqual said. <br>\"If we were not already planning to remove modular GCSEs after the current school year, we think there would now be a strong case for doing so.\" <br>Overall English GCSE results at grade C and above were down by 1.5 percentage points this year - in line with predictions. <br>But Ofqual adds: \"There has been an unusual distribution pattern, a greater variation between schools than expected. And for some schools the results are a far cry from their expectations.\" <br>The report says it is important to note that \"there has been no political interference\". <br>And it insists that the regulator played its \"proper role, regulating standards\". <br>\"Awarding in January and before was generous, but neither exam boards nor the regulators could have seen it at the time. <br>\"All the evidence at the time was that awarding decisions were if anything harsh.\"</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-504f19d7c0e312b4deaa4802\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-11T11:00:41.034Z\">12.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The hearing is over.

Low pay and poverty-level pensions are issues that require urgent ministerial attention. But this is not the argument I hear from Brighton. I hear indiscriminate arguments against a freeze on all public sector pay and in defence of all pension deals.</p> <p>I am wary of using personal anecdotes but while I was at the Edinburgh Festival I bumped into old friends in their early fifties with public sector pensions so generous that I cannot compete with their lifestyles. They were between foreign holidays, recommended lavish restaurants, enjoyed the theatres and good wine. One told me that she had been offered a pension only a few pounds lower than her monthly salary. It was too good to refuse. The drinks were on her, but I won\u2019t support strikes so that there will be many more drinks on people like her.</p> <p>Similarly, some in the public sector earn wages they do not deserve, with responsibilities so ill-defined they are lucky to get away with a pay freeze. They \u201cwork\u201d side by side with those who are appallingly paid and who work very hard.

This is not about replacing Lord Ashcroft\u2019s previous support to candidates in winnable seats. It is about supporting those same candidates with advice and counsel from seasoned campaigners about everything from harnessing social media and local media relations to how to build great campaign teams.</p> <p>Any political party needs to continue to adapt and learn. The Conservative campaigning operation has always been a force to be reckoned with, but we cannot \u2013 and must not \u2013 stand still.

I have not read the full text yet, but according to extracts released overnight, he is going to propose a crackdown on bogus self-employment - workers being falsely categorised as self-employed. This allows employers to avoid tax, but it also means workers lose benefits like sick pay and holiday pay. It is a particular problem in the construction industry and is said to cost the Exchequer \u00a3350m a year.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the issue of bogus self-employment, in the construction sector and more widely, I am determined that we look at this issue again.</p> <p>There is a careful balance to be struck. I do not want in any way to undermine genuine self-employment. But nor should contractual arrangements be distorted and misrepresented to avoid tax and undermine terms and conditions. It\u2019s not fair to taxpayers. And it\u2019s not fair to your members either.</p> <p>So I have asked the Shadow Chief Secretary, Rachel Reeves, to look again at the then Treasury's 2009 proposals for reform \u2013 abandoned by this government \u2013 and to consult employers, UCATT and the wider TUC to see if there is a better and fairer way forward.</p> </blockquote> <p>But the full speech seems more wide-ranging.

To coincide with the hearing, <a href=\"http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storyCode=6289695\">the Times Educational Supplement has published an exclusive story saying that Ofqual ordered an exam board to raise its grade boundaries for English GCSE.</a> Here\u2019s an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>England\u2019s qualifications watchdog forced an exam board to make significant changes to GCSE English grades examiners had insisted were \u201cfair\u201d just two weeks before the publication of this summer\u2019s controversial results, TES has learned.</p> <p>Ofqual\u2019s intervention - which contradicts a key finding from its inquiry into the marking crisis - has prompted calls from a former Ofqual board member for chief regulator Glenys Stacey to resign, describing her position as \u201cuntenable\u201d.</p> <p>June\u2019s grade boundaries were correct and set by examiners \u201cusing their best professional judgement, taking into account all of the evidence available to them,\u201d Ms Stacey concluded when publishing Ofqual\u2019s inquiry report ten days ago. But letters between Ofqual and exam board Edexcel, seen by TES, reveal that examiners\u2019 professional judgement was actually overruled by the regulator.</p> <p>Ofqual ordered Edexcel to dramatically toughen up its English GCSE grade boundary despite strong protests from the board that its original decision was \u201cfair\u201d and backed by \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d. The last minute changes will have led to many pupils missing out on crucial C grades.</p> </blockquote> <p>I\u2019ll be covering the Ofqual hearing in detail.</p> <p>But there\u2019s lots of other politics around today too. Here\u2019s the agenda:</p> <p><em>8.30am:</em> David Davis and Liam Fox are among the Tories launching a new group, Conservative Voice. As Nicholas Watt reports, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/11/tory-group-cameron-detoxifying-values\">it will tell David Cameron to spend less time on modernising and detoxifying the Conservative brand and focus more attention on core Tory values if the party is to win the next election.</a></p> <p><em>10am</em>: Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, gives a speech to the TUC conference.</p> <p><em>10.15am:</em> Glenys Stacey, the Ofqual chief regulator, and other Ofqual executives give evidence to the Commons education committee about the GCSE grading row.</p> <p><em>10.15am:</em> Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Metropolitan police commissioner, gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee about Olympics security. The committee is also hearing from Paul Deighton, Locog\u2019s chief executive, and Lord Coe, its chair, at 11am; from Charles Farr, director of the office for security and counter-terrorism at the Home Office at 11.45am: and from Nick Buckles, the G4S chief executive, at 12.30pm.</p> <p><em>12.30pm:</em> David Cameron and Owen Paterson, the new environment secretary, host an event marking 70 companies signing up to provide training and work placements for young people in the food industry.</p> <p><em>1pm:</em> Vince Cable, the business secretary, gives a speech setting out his industrial strategy. As Patrick Wintour reports,<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/10/cable-business-bank-industrial-strategy\"> he will say that the government will set up a British business bank.</a></p> <p><em>1.30pm:</em> Theresa May, the home secretary, gives a speech to the police superintendents\u2019 annual conference.</p> <p><em>2.30pm:</em> George Osborne, the chancellor, takes questions in the Commons.</p> <p>As usual, I'll be covering all the breaking political news, as well as looking at the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web. I'll post a lunchtime summary at around 1pm and another in the afternoon.</p> <p>If you want to follow me on Twitter, I'm at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@AndrewSparrow.</a></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-11T08:56:49.435Z\">at 9.56am BST</time></p>  </div>",
  "<p>An <a href=\"http://www.humanism.org.uk/news/view/1108\" title=\"\">extraordinary poll</a> published by the British Humanist Association (BHA) highlights the public ambivalence about assisted suicide and euthanasia. In conjunction with other recent surveys, it shows that more people are in favour of the law allowing the killing of relatively healthy patients like Tony Nicklinson than of those who are terminally ill.</p> <p>The \"respectable\" wing of the assisted dying movement, Dignity in Dying, wants a very limited right to medically assisted suicide: only people who are terminally ill and in full possession of their faculties would qualify. Even this limited position is hugely controversial.</p> <p>But the BHA believes that doctors should be allowed to help kill anyone who really wants to die and who cannot manage for themselves. This applies explicitly to perfectly healthy people as well as the terminally ill. And it is more popular than the limited position. No more than 15% of the population are opposed, or strongly opposed to it.</p> <p>In fact, these attitudes are perfectly coherent and show that people understand there are clear limits to individualism. What the public wants is for everyone to have the right to determine as much as possible about their own lives. This includes the manner and moment of death. Suicide then becomes the grandest and clearest declaration that our lives are our own to do what we want with.</p> <p>You may think that this kind of autonomy is unrealistic and that it can lead to a distorting egoism. I certainly do. But that doesn't make it any less attractive. It speaks to a rather gnostic idea of our being free spirits trapped in gross bodies, which is why someone like Nicklinson made such a powerful figure: his mind was unaffected but his body was ruined.</p> <p>Yet in practice we do know that no one is like that, and certainly no one is like that all the time. Nicklinson's reasoning powers may have been entirely unimpaired by his illness, and may even have been sharpened by it. But a mind is much more than the sum of its reasoning powers. The condition of his body furnished the contents of his mind, and the material he had to reason on.</p> <p>Just as important was the attitude of his family and those around him. I don't want to suggest for a moment that they were actuated by anything but love and the desire to help him realise the end he wanted for his life. The point, however, is that their decision and their support were very important. Had they opposed his wishes he would hardly have got anywhere.</p> <p>And, of course, families often do disagree about what's best for a family member. In almost all normal circumstances, the ideal of autonomy comes up very sharply against the reality of interdependence, and sometimes straightforward dependence.</p> <p>That is why people are \u2013 quite rightly \u2013 suspicious of the apparently more limited programme of allowing doctors to kill off the terminally ill who are clear that they want to die because their life offers nothing more than suffering.</p> <p>Those who stand to benefit from someone's death are very likely, sincerely, to see the life they want to end as hardly worth living. This is a nasty fact about human nature, but any kind of humanism that isn't grounded in human nature is no more than ludicrous and sinister self-deception. Our propensity to self-serving self-deception is one reason why Christians must insist that God loves every one of his creatures; no one except God does or could.</p> <p>No wonder that the most recent piece of anti-euthanasia propaganda that I was sent highlighted a figure of 300,000 incidents of elder abuse every year. Supporters of assisted dying see this point. But it just makes them believe more firmly that the right kind of legislation, with the clearest possible safeguards, will stop unwanted grannies being liquidated for their asset value.</p> <p>I can't share that confidence. Really demented and unpleasant old people can appear rather less human than foetuses do and the changing interpretations of the Abortion Act show how little legal safeguards are worth when the sentiment behind them evaporates. Whether or not you think that British women ought to have access to abortion on demand, that's not what the law says, nor what parliament intended in 1967.</p> <p>If a mother has the right to dispose of an unwanted foetus, why doesn't a daughter have the right to dispose of an unwanted, incoherent and incontinent old person whose miserable life will only ever get worse? What could be easier than to propose to such a creature that its life is not in fact worth living?</p> <p>The Tony Nicklinsons are the easy cases to legislate for, not just because they are rare.</p>",
  "<p>Few people would notice the willow blister, a spore-shooting fungus that grows parasitically on twigs in a small corner of Wales. Fewer still are likely to realise that this is one of the rarest fungi in the world, a distinction that gives the blister a place on an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/11/100-most-endangered-species-planet\">unenviable list: the world's 100 most threatened species</a>.</p> <p>Equally unlikely to be noticed is the spoon-billed sandpiper, a small, dull-coloured bird that breeds in Russia and migrates to south-east Asia, targeted by hunters on the way.</p> <p>The pygmy three-toed sloth, no bigger than a newborn baby when fully grown, is found only on a single island, off the coast of Panama. The woolly spider monkey, from the Atlantic forest of Brazil, is under threat from the increasing fragmentation of its last remaining habitats.</p> <p>The list, published on Tuesday at the World Conservation Congress in South Korea, the quadrennial meeting of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), was compiled by 8,000 scientists, and is the first of its kind.</p> <p>The only obvious common characteristic of the animals on it is that all are clinging precariously to existence as a result of human actions such as destroying habitats, polluting, hunting and changing the climate. But the scientists who compiled the list had another criterion: they have highlighted species they fear will be allowed to die out without a murmur because they have no obvious benefits for human beings.</p> <p>The list is presented as a challenge, with the title: \"Priceless or worthless?\" Its compilers ask whether we care only for species that are iconic and \"charismatic\", such as tigers and pandas and those, such as the appetite-suppressing hoodia cactus of the Kalahari, that may yield benefits for medicine or other purposes. Or should we decide, they wonder, that even the apparently less-favoured species we are wiping out deserve to be preserved.</p> <p>For Jonathan Baillie, director of conservation at the Zoological Society of London, which compiled the list along with the International Union for Conservation of Nature, this dilemma reflects serious problems with the way conservation is funded today.</p> <p>He said: \"The donor community and conservation movement are increasingly leaning towards a 'what can nature do for us?' approach, where species and wild habitats are valued and prioritised according to these services they provided for people. This has made it increasingly difficult for conservationists to protect the most threatened species on the planet.\"</p> <p>In order to justify spending money on conservation efforts, scientists have felt under increasing pressure to argue for the human benefits that would accrue \u2013 for instance, calling for forests to be preserved because they can prevent landslides and naturally purify water for human consumption rather than because forests should be maintained for their own sake.</p> <p>In some cases, the potential for \"useful\" purposes for some species is contributing to their destruction. The wild yam of South Africa is supposed to have cancer-alleviating properties, according to traditional medicine, but the resulting hunt for the plant is threatening its very existence.</p> <p>In others, the commercialisation of nature is having a damaging effect \u2013 the Franklin's bumble bee, found in California and Oregon, is under threat because of diseases spread by commercially bred bumblebees. Attenborough's Pitcher Plant, named after the famous naturalist Sir David, lives only on Mount Victoria, in the Philippines, but is under threat from collectors because of its fame.</p> <p>Prof Baillie presents a stark choice: \"We have an important moral and ethical decision to make: do these species have a right to survive or do we have a right to drive them to extinction?\"</p> <p>Some of the creatures on the list are down to the last few individuals. For example, numbers of the saola \u2013 an antelope known as the Asian unicorn, so rarely is it sighted \u2013 have been whittled down to the last few tens in existence.</p> <p>Ellen Butcher, of the Zoological Society of London, explained: \"All of the species listed are unique and irreplaceable. If they vanish, no amount of money can bring them back. If we take immediate action we can give them a fighting chance for survival. But this requires society to support the moral and ethical position that all species have an inherent right to exist.\"</p> <p>It is possible that some future medical application may be found for the willow blister fungus, or other plants or even animals on the list. But the conservationists involved stressed that this should not be the decider on whether we make efforts to halt the decline of species that we are destroying.</p> <p>\"All species have a value to nature and thus, in turn to us humans,\" said Simon Stuart, chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission. \"Although the value of some species may not appear obvious at first, all species in fact contribute in their way to the healthy functioning of the planet.\"</p>",

Thank God we can let Fred Perry lie easy. Thank God for Andy Murray.</p> <p>The Scot's career reached an apogee of excellence over five sets in the wind-whipped testing ground of the Arthur Ashe Court at Flushing Meadows in the US Open final against the defending champion Novak Djokovic, who was spent and gracious at the end. He was spent because Murray made him run miles; gracious because he is a decent man.</p> <p>Murray's 7-6 (12-10), 7-5, 2-6, 3-6, 6-2 victory over an opponent exactly a week younger than him and whose career he has trailed like a jet vapour since they were 11 years old, equalled the longest in a final here, four hours and 54 minutes \u2013 exactly the same time it took Murray's coach, Ivan Lendl, to lose to Mats Wilander in the 1988 final.</p> <p>Murray reckoned he saw Old Stone Face smile at the end. Well he might. It was a flawed, heroic, unforgettable contest, taking about as long as a decent production of Macbeth, with nearly as many twists and turns. A scattered collection of Scots watched, headed by the loud knights Sean Connery and Alex Ferguson \u2013 as well Andy's delighted mother, Judy \u2013 as a final that arrived a day late due to a rain-made postponement, the fifth here in five years, held New Yorkers spellbound. But it was worth the wait. This, after all, was the culmination of a quest that has frustrated British males in 287 grand slam tournaments since 1936.</p> <p>\"They were incredibly tricky conditions,\" Murray said. \"After the third and fourth sets it was really tough for me. Novak is such a fighter. I just managed to get through. I think that was almost a smile I just saw [motioning towards Lendl]. He's one of the greatest players, made eight consecutive finals. I want to thank not just him, but the whole team, who have been there from the start.\"</p> <p>As Murray lifted the trophy, the thought crept through none the less: could this really have happened? It could. It did. And it could not have happened to a nicer guy. Djokovic added: \"I want to congratulate Andy on his first grand slam, he thoroughly deserves it. I really tried my best. I gave it my all. It was a tremendous match.\"</p> <p>When the sainted Perry won his third US title in 1936, beating Don Budge in five quick sets with wooden rackets in the same event under a different name, the National Championships, it was at a different venue, on the grass of the West Side Tennis Club at nearby Forest Hills. They wore long trousers and slicked their hair. They didn't watch television nor fly often in aeroplanes. They didn't play tie-breaks and they didn't get paid.</p> <p>Murray earned $1.9m (\u00a31.1m) for his maiden major victory to go with career earnings of $21.5m (\u00a313.4m) and is worth \u00a324m through endorsements and prize-money; Perry turned pro after beating Budge and made much more through his famous shirts than he ever did with a tennis racket. This was hardly about the money, though. As in Perry's case, it was about fulfilment of personal ambition, as well as a nation's absurdly drawn-out longing to adjust tennis history.</p> <p>And how he made us suffer. Again. He seems incapable of winning easily in the really big matches; indeed, at four times of asking in grand slam finals, he has lost fairly convincingly. This was a victory against a rival who'd been in sublime form all fortnight and who, after going two sets down, came back at him as if he'd stolen his car. The first two sets were as tight as the scores suggest, the tie-break lingering 26 minutes before Murray converted his sixth set point. In the second, he raced to 4-0 and there were not many who reckoned on what was to come. Murray held his advantage, with a little difficulty, took the set and then we got down to some serious fighting across the net.</p> <p>The last player to win the US Open from two sets down was Pancho Gonzales in 1949. Djokovic might not have known that. He did know that this was the first time Murray had won two sets in five slam finals. Under the cosh in the third, Murray aced to hold after giving up two break points; the drama would not leave the building. Murray never imagined Djokovic would disintegrate without assistance. He had to crack him again. He could not afford to do what he had done too many times before and let the moment go free.</p> <p>Their gaze now saw only the other, two kids who'd come such a long way. A second Murray double fault gave Djokovic two break points in the third game \u2013 and he did not flinch. When he hit long from deep under pressure in the sixth game, he put the gun back in Murray's hand with two bullets. Murray shot wide three times, and the Serb held for 4-2 after three hours. Djokovic did that bull-snort and swagger as he broke for 5-2. The dynamic of the contest and the energy on the court had shifted considerably. He smashed an overhead to take the set and, although Murray had a one-set cushion, it was one with pins in it. He had nowhere to rest his head yet.</p> <p>A beautiful disguised drop-shot earned Djokovic two break points at the start of the fourth, and a stout backhand volley clinched it. Murray was in trouble, not so much because he was playing poorly \u2013 although his level had slipped \u2013 but because his opponent had found his A game and did not look like losing it. Djokovic saved two break points in the fourth game, fired up by a time warning he thought unjust. The message was: don't get in my way.</p> <p>Murray did his best. In a memorable 30-shot rally at deuce and 3-2 on Djokovic's serve that earned a standing ovation, the Serb fell heavily behind the baseline and Murray hit the winner with malice. Yet still Djokovic kept the break intact \u2013 and levelled for two-all.</p> <p>Murray, energised despite giving two sets in a row, broke in the first game of the deciding stanza and it was Djokovic's turn to cope with the anxiety. He had proved so many times that these were the situations that brought out the animal in him \u2013 so memorably in two semis and two finals, here last year against Federer and Nadal, and in Melbourne this year, against Murray and Nadal. He doesn't look like a tank, but he is as strong as one.</p> <p>The test for Murray was to match this inspired lunatic and, at the end of a long, muscular rally that pulled both players here and there and had the fans screaming into the night, Murray held serve and gave out a crowd-scream of his own. He was engaged again, all right.</p> <p>They'd been on court just half an hour short of their four hours and 50 minutes purgatory in Melbourne and Murray could smell history in his nostrils \u2013 or was it cordite? They were playing tennis as if they wanted to get out some guns and go at it for real, each unbelievable rally containing one high-quality shot after another.</p> <p>Somehow, they were playing the most remarkable tennis, in tandem, when their bodies surely were screaming for relief. Even when Murray broke a second time, there was no certainty about the outcome; Djokovic, after all came from four games down in the third set. Anything was possible in those most improbable of contests. Of course, he broke back, for 1-3.</p> <p>There was sweat in every stroke and that was just on this keyboard. Djokovic's first serve and volley, four and a half hours into the match, was as brave a shot as we'd seen all night, but he was desperate, and rightly so.</p> <p>Murray's ground-strokes grew short; Djokovic found strength from somewhere, but the Scot was almost cruel in the way he pushed and pulled him across the baseline for deuce, yet could not get the break, and, although leading 4-2, was hanging on like Frank Bruno when he outlasted Oliver McCall to win the world heavyweight title \u2013 at his fourth attempt.</p> <p>Djokovic started cramping up at 0-30 on his serve in the seventh game. The power drained from his serve, not his spirit, but a weary forehand into the net gave Murray the opportunity for the final knockout punch. Djokovic went to his stool for treatment on his groin. Murray idled behind the service line. Then they pounded out the final act of their special bout.</p> <p>Murray batted down a backhand volley for 15-0; Murray successfully challenged a called-out ace, fingernail legal, for 30-0; Djokovic hit long and Murray had three match points \u2013 Djokovic roused his legs to hunt down a smash and save the first; Murray went for an ace down the T, just long \u2013 and Djokovic hit the return long on the second, his Lendl-improved second, and he was a grand slam winner at last.</p> <p>It is difficult to convey the feeling that rippled around the stadium, even along the press row, but let's just say there were a lot of grown men crying \u2013 and I know who they are.</p>"
