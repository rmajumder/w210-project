  "<p><strong>\"Ricardo did it in a shoot-out against England in the summer but has any goalkeeper ever saved a penalty and scored in normal time?\"</strong> asked Joe Blair in 2004.</p> <p>The answer is: yes, yes and kind of, Joe. We've dug up two bona fide examples, as well as the curious case of Niall Quinn.</p> <p>First up, is the former Paraguayan captain Jose Luis Chilavert, whose goal-scoring record - as Tom Adams was quick to point out - was rightly famed. \" I reckon it must be inevitable that Chilavert scored and faced penalties in the same game,\" writes Mr Adams. A shame then, that he decided to \"leave the laborious trawl through Velez Sarsfield and Colombian results over the 1990s for someone else\". He left them for John to be precise, who diligently confirmed that Chilavert scored and saved a penalty in Velez Sarsfield's 2-0 win over Independiente in 1999.</p> <p>Less well-known are the goal-plundering exploits of current Bayer Leverkusen keeper Jorg Butt, who has scored 24 goals (all penalties) in his career to date; while playing for previous club Hamburg, he even managed to end up top scorer with nine goals in the 1999-2000 season. It was in the same season that Butt scored and saved a penalty in Hamburg's 3-1 victory over Schalke.</p> <p>Which leaves us with Niall Quinn. Back in the days of the 'old' first division and no substitute keepers, Quinn - who had already scored - was stuck between the posts after Tony Coton was sent off for Manchester City against Derby at Maine Road during the 1990-91 season. Dean Saunders stepped up to take the penalty and, in the immortal words of James Sweet, Quinn \"got a hand to it and it went over the bar in the style of Banks against Pele\". Indeed, according to Kenneth O Brien, \"such was the big man from Perrytown's expertise, he actually travelled to Italia 90 as Ireland's third goalkeeper\". Which, we suppose, makes Niall Quinn nearly count. But not quite.</p> <p>And, to go back to Joe Blair's original question, we turn to <a href=\"goalkeepersaredifferent.com\" title=\"\">goalkeepersaredifferent.com</a>. Apparently, prior to 1912, goalkeepers regularly appeared on the score sheet thanks to rules that allowed them to handle the ball up to the halfway line.</p> <h2>ROONEY AND MANCHESTER UNITED</h2> <p><strong>\"Will Wayne Rooney be the first Scouser to play for Manchester United?\"</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/sep/15/theknowledge.sport\" title=\"\">asked Alex Freudmann in 2004</a>.</p> <p>The answer, quite simply, is no. But here's Richard Bryce to provide a little background information. \"Young Wayne will be the eighth Scouser to pull on the red shirt of Manchester United,\" he begins. \"The most illustrious predecessor was Croxteth-born Steve Coppell, who played almost 400 games for United between 1975 and 1983, and 42 for England.</p> <p>\"Before him, Liverpudlians Willie Anderson and Albert Kinsey played ten times and once respectively in the sixties and Ted Connor played 15 matches between 1909 and 1911, with Arthur Marshall notching up six in 1902-03.\"</p> <p>There's more. \"Neither is Rooney the first Scouser to sign from Everton. Alf Schofield joined Newton Heath (as United were then called) from Everton in 1900 and played 179 games until retiring in 1907. More recently, John Gidman racked up 115 games in United red after signing from the Toffees in 1981.\"</p> <p>As several of you point out, Peter Davenport, who scored 26 goals for United between 1986 and 1988, may also be added to the list, though it depends whether you consider his birthplace Birkenhead to be a Scouse area.</p> <h2>PELE AND STOKE</h2> <p><strong>\"I went to watch Stoke v Santos as a young boy in 1969 and I could have sworn that Pele did not play in this game,\" </strong>said Andrew Pimlott back in July in 2003.<strong> \"Now someone I know reckons I am mistaken and not only did he play but he also scored. Is this true?\"</strong></p> <p>Alas your memory isn't what it was, Andrew.</p> <p>\"A friend of mine who was at the game says that Pele did play, although he doesn't remember if he scored or not,\" says Mike Lockwood. \"He does, remember, nevertheless, that it finished 3-2 to Brazil, and Dennis Smith had a goal disallowed just before half-time when the ref blew a la Clive Thomas when the ball was in the air from a corner, and micro-seconds before Smith powered an unstoppable header into the back of the net\".</p> <p>Carl Andre concurs and is able to add a detail or two. \"Pel\u00e9 didn't just play, he also netted twice in that particular game. Santos won 3-2 and Jimmy Greenhoff scored at least once, maybe twice. I'm not sure.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Send your questions to</strong><a href=\"mailto:\" title=\"\"><strong> knowledge@theguardian.com</strong></a></p>",
  "<p>Brazil have never won Olympic gold, a failing that pains a proud football nation and has prompted the team's coach, Mano Menezes, to label this tournament \"The London Project\", but a glorious chance to break new ground awaits at Wembley on Saturday having swept aside South Korea in the semi-final.</p> <p>Menezes' side, inspired by the mesmerising Neymar, the polished Oscar and the potent Leandro Dami\u00e3o, cruised into Saturday's final against Mexico \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/07/mexico-beat-japan-olympic-semi?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">3-1 victors over Japan</a> \u2013 with a performance that doubled as an emphatic riposte to accusations in the Brazilian media of not taking the Olympics seriously enough. Angered, they cancelled an open training session for on the eve of the semi-final. They also punished South Korea by taking their goal tally to 15 in five matches and demonstrated they possess the pedigree to improve on the silver medals from Los Angeles in 1984 and Seoul in 1988.</p> <p>\"It is 24 years since Brazil were last in the Olympic final and that shows it is not easy to get there,\" Menezes said. \"We have always had quality players but we have also faced a lot of quality and it shows the merits of this team that it has reached the final. But it is only the final. There is one more step to go.\"</p> <p>Brazil arrived in the semi-final with a 100% record and their forward line gelling perfectly, justification for taking umbrage to criticism back home, but South Korea were not initially overawed by their opponents or the occasion. They took the game to the favourites, a decision justified by a vulnerable Brazilian defence and the movement of the Korean front pair of Ji Dong-won and Kim Hyun-sung, and should have led before Neymar, Oscar and Leandro found their imperious rhythm.</p> <p>Kim Hyun-sung had a back-post header hacked clear by Sandro after a fine turn in the area by Nam Tae-hee and was put through by a lovely chip from Ji. A brave header beyond the Brazil goalkeeper, Gabriel, lacked the pace to cross the line and prompted an equally courageous effort by the Sunderland striker only for Thiago Silva to intervene. Ji began impressively and was close to finding the top corner with an audacious drive from 35 yards. Once Brazil had withstood the early pressure, however, they took complete control and South Korea wilted before the quality of the opposition attack. \"We blew the early chances and we tired,\" said their coach Hong Myung Bo, his side having played 120 minutes against Team GB on Saturday.</p> <p>Oscar, Chelsea's new \u00a325m recruit, has shown a fine understanding with Neymar throughout the tournament and the pair were involved in the majority of the chances that fell to Brazil from midway through the first half onwards. Leandro twice went close before Neymar found Oscar and, after an unchallenged run across the Korean area, he rolled a perfectly weighted pass into Romulo, who beat Lee Bum-young inside his near post too easily. In fairness to the keeper, he had injured a knee moments earlier when colliding with Leandro to block a poor back-pass.</p> <p>Ji shot inches over from another ambitious attempt on the stroke of half-time but there was no concerted response from South Korea and the tie was effectively ended when Leandro doubled Brazil's lead early in the second half. Neymar was the architect, playing an incisive one-two with Marcelo into the area, and though Brazil's left-back missed the cut-back it fell invitingly for the unmarked striker to tuck away.</p> <p>Leandro's second, Brazil's third, was a clinical touch of improvisation into the bottom corner after Oscar and Neymar, of course, had weaved their way through the Korean defence once more. They ultimately progressed to Wembley with a stroll.</p>",

They have been charged with hooliganism motivated by religious hatred after performing a \"punk prayer\" against President Vladimir Putin in a Moscow cathedral.</p> <p>Performing in Moscow's Olimpisky Stadium on Tuesday night, Madonna donned a balaclava and stripped off her clothes to reveal the words \"Pussy Riot\" scrawled across her back during a performance of her 1984 hit Like a Virgin.</p> <p>She was the latest in a long list of global stars who have come out to support the trio.</p> <p>\"I know there are many sides to every story, and I mean no disrespect to the church or the government, but I think these girls \u2026 have done something courageous and they have paid the price for this act and I pray for their freedom,\" Madonna said earlier in the show to massive applause. \"They deserve the right to be free.\"</p> <p>Pytor Verzilov, Tolokonnikova's husband, praised the move: \"She might be changing Russia's history by this. To give a sentence after something like this would be commiting international political suicide, admitting that you're no better than North Korea.\"</p> <p>In closing arguments on Tuesday, lawyers for Pussy Riot appeared to accept a conviction as a foregone conclusion. \"If the order is handed down from above to jail them, then they will be jailed. This is a political case from beginning to end,\" lawyer Mark Feygin said.</p> <p>Prosecutors used their closing statements to argue that the women were not carrying out a political act, but acting on deep hatred for Russian Orthodoxy.</p> <p>\"They violated the traditions of our country,\" Nikiforov said. He said the fact that \"no politicians\" were named in the punk band's song proved it was not a political act. The name and chorus of the song Pussy Riot performed was Virgin Mary, Chase Putin Out.</p> <p>Prosecutors presented the women as dangerous feminists. \"All the defendants talked about being feminists and said that is allowed in the Russian Orthodox church,\" said Yelena Pavlova, a lawyer for several of the nine complainants who claimed they were insulted by Pussy Riot's performance.</p> <p>\"This does not correspond with reality. Feminism is a mortal sin.\"</p> <p>The Pussy Riot case has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/03/pussy-riot-trial-russia\" title=\"\">reawakened anti-government passions</a> that first emerged when Putin announced last autumn that he was returning to the presidency. Opposition activists have called for an impromptu protest to be held on 19 August.</p> <p>Addressing the court in the afternoon, defence lawyers for the band argued that the women's performance was an act of opposition against Putin and was not motivated by religious hatred. \"The 'prayer' they sang was a political one,\" lawyer Violetta Volkova said.</p> <p>Feygin gave an impassioned speech warning of the consequences of a conviction, which ended with applause from the journalists witnessing the trial.</p> <p>\"Russia has no rule of law. Russia has no justice system,\" he said. \"Nothing has changed from Soviet times.\"</p> <p>He warned that a guilty verdict would \"definitely tear up relations between society and government\".</p> <p>Society would never forgive the government for jailing three innocent women, he said, warning that tensions, including between society and the church, were building to similar levels as before the Bolshevik revolution of 1917.</p> <p>But Feygin appeared to accept a conviction as a foregone conclusion. \"If the order is handed down from above to jail them, then they will be jailed. This is a political case from beginning to end.\"</p> <p>Pussy Riot have argued that their performance inside Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in February was designed to call attention to the politicisation of the Orthodox church, which was a key agitator for Putin's re-election.</p> <p>Church officials have said their trial has been willed by God. The women have apologised if they offended any Orthodox believers.</p> <p>Prosecutors said on Tuesday that their apologies were insincere and that the victims had \"the right not to be merciful\". They argued that the leader of the church, Patriarch Kirill, had been personally insulted and was \"not just an ordinary citizen\".</p> <p>The three women addressed the court on Tuesday and urged the judge to deliver a not-guilty verdict.</p> <p>A verdict is expected in coming days.</p>",
  "<p>Please check you have a full stomach and empty bladder before we begin. I'm going to need your full attention here. Right. So. <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-girl-who-became-three-boys\" title=\"The Girl Who Became Three Boys\"><strong>The Girl Who Became Three Boys</strong></a> (Channel 4). Gemma Barker, Jessica Sayers and \"Alice\" (who didn't want her identity revealed in the programme) were all friends. Alice began an online relationship with a boy called Aaron. When they eventually met in person, he was very nice. The only odd thing about him (apart from the number of family members he had lost to accidents or illness, so Alice was unable ever to meet them) was that he refused to take off his hat. Soon, Jess began a similar relationship with Aaron's friend Luke. He wouldn't take his hat off either. Not because they had alopecia, as the girls surmised, but because they were both Gemma in disguise.</p> <p>Then \"Luke\" (and from this point on, inverted commas begin to be strewn with an ever more lavish hand) started pressurising Jess to take things further. \"I was very frigid as a teenager,\" said Jess \u2013 now 18 and a beguiling mixture of bathos and chirpy innocence \u2013 regarding her 15-year-old self. So \"Luke\" was \"unfaithful\" to Jess and up popped Connor (or, as perhaps you already, unlike Jess, suspect \u2013 \"Connor\") as an online \"friend\" of Luke to comfort Jess in her hour of need. He too never removed his hat. She could barely see his face. \"He was very good-looking,\" recalled Jess, nevertheless. \"Him or his picture?\" asked the interviewer, after a pause. \"The picture.\"</p> <p>Luke was also silent. He would text and hold up his phone for Jess to read his contributions to their conversations.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Alice (she's real, remember, just protecting her identity on telly) was losing her virginity, relatively pleasurably, to Aaron. Connor took Jess's later, by force. Then Alice found a dildo in Aaron's bag and Jess removed Connor's hat when he fell asleep after the deed. She thought \"he\" was Aaron. After that, the police got involved, arresting \"Aaron\" for sexually assaulting Jess. During a strip search at the station the truth was literally revealed.</p> <p>This gift of a subject was well served by the programme makers, who guided viewers firmly through a welter of tangled friendships and shifting tenses, pronouns and prosthetics. It kept track of characters who moved from online to reality and back again without anyone involved feeling the need to explain the number of dimensions being dwelled in. Teenage love, need, innocence and vulnerability tore holes in reality, forged connections between everything and nothing and blinded everyone \u2013 maybe even including Gemma \u2013 to the truth. It was a vivid testimony to the potent blend of insecurity and overconfidence that defines our teenage years. The means and methods of its demonstration may change, but adolescence stays the same.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/lost-children/episode-guide/series-1/episode-2\" title=\"Lost Children\"><strong>Lost Children</strong></a> (Channel 4) looked at what can happen when teenage hormones flood the body of an emotionally battered boy. Josh was taken from his heroin-addicted mother at the age of three and placed in more than 20 different homes before he was six, when he and his little sister Demi were adopted by Sue, a social worker prepared to handle a difficult child. \"You think a lot of attention and love will be enough,\" said Sue. But Josh is now 14 and it seems she was wrong. After a good start at a special school run by Barnardo's for those who have been excluded from the mainstream system, his behaviour deteriorated there and at home. His drug use escalated and valuable objects started to go missing from the house. Sue's voice got smaller, weaker, sadder by the minute.</p> <p>Eventually, agonisingly, the adoption broke down and Josh returned to the care system. He seemed almost relieved and his behaviour at school improved. Perhaps it is easier not to have a home or someone who loves you at all than live in perennial fear that they will be taken from you again. Demi, one presumes, was removed from her mother at a younger age. Maybe fewer memories will save her.</p> <p>It was a sensitive portrait of the terrible damage that can be passed down through generations (Josh's mother was herself in multiple care homes from an early age) but overall it left you with a feeling that it was just another drop in the ocean of evidence for something we already surely know. Without asking more questions, providing more context and furthering the debate about how things can be changed it didn't feel quite weighty enough to justify the intrusion into, maybe even borderline exploitation of,&#xa0;the subjects' lives.</p>",
  "<p>The hangover from the weekend is getting worse. After all that success on Saturday evening, there have been a string of disappointing British performances on Monday and Tuesday, culminating in Lawrence Okoye's last-place finish in the men's discus. Okoye took up the sport seriously only in the summer of 2010, but every serious decision he has made since then has been shaped by his dreams of competing in the final in London.</p> <p>The one thing he never imagined, as he said himself, was that he would end up finishing last. Now, at the age of 20, he will have to decide whether he wants to carry on in the sport. He admitted that he has \"some big decisions to make\" but was too shrewd to act on the spur of the moment, when his mind was still clouded with a disappointment that will linger for a long while yet.</p> <p>Only an hour earlier, Tiffany Porter had been knocked out in the semi-finals of the women's 100m hurdles, and that followed a morning in which neither Phillips Idowu nor Goldie Sayers made it through the first round of their own events. All four of the athletes were in the top 10 of the world rankings this year. It turns out winning gold is not as easy as all that.</p> <p>For Okoye, it was an especially hard defeat. Idowu, Porter, and Sayers had all been struggling with injuries in the run-up to the Games. Okoye, on the other hand, was fully fit and had nothing to blame except his own failings.</p> <p>He reckoned he \"had tried too hard\". It was not as flippant an excuse as it sounds. He was just too distraught to do much talking, and was certainly in no mood at all to explain himself to the press or the public. His demeanour was so thunderous that it took some pluck just to summon up the will to ask him anything at all.</p> <p>The lure of competing at these Olympics had been strong enough to persuade Okoye to give up his promising rugby union career at London Irish, and also to defer a place to study law at Oxford University. Okoye, 21-stone heavy and 6ft 6in tall, runs the 100m in under 11 seconds, and has a physique that could have been carved out of teak.</p> <p>He only took up the discus in the summer of 2010, and simply had not spent enough time honing his technique. He could not rely on it to go right, and was something of a scatter gun, combining the odd brilliant throw with a series of shockers that threatened anyone unfortunate enough to be in the vicinity of the infield.</p> <p>Okoye uncorked a new British record throw of 68.24m back in May. If he had been able to replicate that in the final he would have won silver, ahead of Iran's Ehsan Hadadi and Estonia's Gerd Kanter. In fact it was only 3cm shy of the distance that won gold for Germany's Robert Harting. If Okoye had even managed to repeat the 65.28m he threw in qualifying then he would at least have ensured he got to take all six throws in the final, rather than only the first three.</p> <p>It is one thing to throw well in low-key meets on the athletics circuit, another altogether to do it in front of 80,000 people when an Olympic medal is at stake. Okoye is as talented a discus thrower as Britain has ever produced, but this is not a young man's event, it takes time to master. Harting, 28, has not lost a final of any sort in the last two years.</p> <p>Porter finished ninth in the 100m hurdles, one place shy of qualifying for the final. She surely would have made it had an old back problem not flared up at the Crystal Palace Grand Prix three weeks ago. Even without that, though, it is unlikely she would have got near the medals. Australia's Sally Pearson won the final in 12.35sec, setting an Olympic record. She just held off a desperate dip to the line from the USA's Dawn Harper. Kellie Wells of the USA took bronze in a personal best time. All three ran quicker than Porter has ever managed.</p> <p>It gets worse. Neither Margaret Adeoye nor Abi Oyepitan made it to the final of the women's 200m. The new Olympic 400m champion, Sanya Richards-Ross, was the fastest qualifier, in 22.30sec, while her team-mate Allyson Felix was only a single-hundredth of a second behind her. The two Jamaicans, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Veronica Campbell-Brown were both within three-hundredths too. The final promises to be an extraordinary race.</p> <p>As ever, though, hope springs anew for British fans. There were a pair of superb performances in qualifying rounds. Shara Proctor, who was born and raised in Anguilla but is competing for Britain, nailed a 6.83m leap in the first round of the long jump.</p> <p>\"This is a dream come true,\" she said. \"All I wanted to do was make it through to the final, that was the hardest part. I did it, now I've just got to go back tomorrow jump far and get a medal. I feel like I'm in good shape and I want to go over seven metres.\"</p> <p>Andrew Osagie was even more impressive in the 800m semi-finals. He came round the final bend in fifth place, a long way behind the world record holder and world champion David Rudisha. But Osagie timed his kick superbly, and came through into second-place. He will be the first British man to run in an Olympic 800m final in 20 years.</p>",
  "<p>The destruction of Syria is now in full flow. What began as a popular uprising 17 months ago is now an all-out civil war fuelled by regional and global powers that threatens to engulf the entire Middle East. As the battle for the ancient city of Aleppo grinds on and atrocities on both sides multiply, the danger of the conflict spilling over Syria's borders is growing.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-19156286\" title=\"\">defection by Syria's prime minister</a> is the most high-profile coup yet in a well-funded programme, though unlikely to signal any imminent regime collapse. But <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-19133227\" title=\"\">the capture of 48 Iranian pilgrims \u2013 or undercover Revolutionary Guards</a>, depending who you believe \u2013 along with the increasing risk of a Turkish attack on Kurdish areas in Syria and an influx of jihadist fighters gives a taste of what is now at stake.</p> <p>Driving the escalation of the conflict has been western and regional intervention. This isn't Iraq, of course, with hundreds of thousands of troops on the ground, or Libya, with a devastating bombardment from the air. But the sharp increase in arms supplies, funding and technical support from the US, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey and others in recent months has dramatically boosted the rebels' fortunes, as well as the death toll.</p> <p>Barack Obama has so far resisted the demands of liberal hawks and neoconservatives for a direct military assault. Instead he's authorised more traditional forms of CIA covert military backing, Nicaragua-style, for the Syrian rebels.</p> <p>The US, which <a href=\"http://www.us-foreign-policy-perspective.org/index.php?id=323\" title=\"\">backed its first Syrian coup in 1949</a>, has long funded opposition groups. But earlier this year Obama gave a <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/01/us-usa-syria-obama-order-idUSBRE8701OK20120801\" title=\"\">secret order</a> authorising covert (as well as overt financial and diplomatic) support to the armed opposition. That includes <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/21/world/middleeast/cia-said-to-aid-in-steering-arms-to-syrian-rebels.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">CIA paramilitaries on the ground</a>, \"command and control\" and communications assistance, and the funnelling of Gulf arms supplies to favoured Syrian groups across the Turkish border. After Russia and China blocked its last attempt to win UN backing for forced regime change last month, the US administration let it be known it would now step up support for the rebels and co-ordinate <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/22/world/middleeast/us-to-focus-on-forcibly-toppling-syrian-government.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">\"transition\" plans for Syria with Israel and Turkey</a>.</p> <p>\"You'll notice in the last couple of months, the opposition has been strengthened,\" a senior US official told the New York Times last Friday. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/22/world/middleeast/us-to-focus-on-forcibly-toppling-syrian-government.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">\"Now we're ready to accelerate that.\"</a> Not to be outdone, William Hague boasted that Britain was also increasing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/03/hague-uk-help-syria-rebels\" title=\"\">\"non-lethal\" support</a> for the rebels. <a href=\"http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/10783\" title=\"\">Autocratic Saudi Arabia and Qatar are providing the cash and weapons</a>, as the western-backed Syrian National Council acknowledged this week, while Nato member <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/27/us-syria-crisis-centre-idUSBRE86Q0JM20120727\" title=\"\">Turkey has set up a logistics and training base</a> for the Free Syrian Army in or near the Incirlik US air base.</p> <p>For Syrians who want dignity and democracy in a free country, the rapidly mushrooming dependence of their uprising on foreign support is a disaster \u2013 even more than was the case in Libya. After all, it is now officials of the dictatorial and sectarian Saudi regime who choose which armed groups get funding, not Syrians. And it is intelligence officials from the US, which sponsors the Israeli occupation of Syrian territory and dictatorships across the region, who decide which rebel units get weapons.</p> <p>Opposition activists insist they will maintain their autonomy, based on deep-rooted popular support. But the dynamic of external backing clearly risks turning groups dependent on it into instruments of their sponsors, rather than the people they seek to represent. Gulf funding has already sharpened religious sectarianism in the rebel camp, while reports of public alienation from rebel fighters in Aleppo this week testifies to the dangers of armed groups relying on outsiders instead of their own communities.</p> <p>The Syrian regime is of course backed by Iran and Russia, as it has been for decades. But a better analogy for western and Gulf involvement in the Syrian insurrection would be Iranian and Russian sponsorship of an armed revolt in, say, Saudi Arabia. For the western media, which has largely reported the Syrian uprising as a one-dimensional fight for freedom, the now unavoidable evidence of rebel torture and <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2012/08/03/159888/accounts-of-syria-rebels-executing.html\" title=\"\">prisoner executions</a> \u2013 along with kidnappings by al-Qaida-style groups, who once again find themselves in alliance with the US \u2013 seems to have come as a bit of a shock.</p> <p>In reality, the Syrian crisis always had multiple dimensions that crossed the region's most sensitive fault lines. It was from the start a genuine uprising against an authoritarian regime. But it has also increasingly morphed into a sectarian conflict, in which the Alawite-dominated Assad government has been able to portray itself as the protector of minorities \u2013 Alawite, Christian and Kurdish \u2013 against a Sunni-dominated opposition tide.</p> <p>The intervention of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf autocracies, which have tried to protect themselves from the wider Arab upheaval by playing the anti-Shia card, is transparently aimed at a sectarian, not a democratic, outcome. But it is the third dimension \u2013 Syria's alliance with Tehran and Lebanon's Shia resistance movement, Hezbollah \u2013 that has turned the Syrian struggle into a proxy war against Iran and a global conflict.</p> <p>Many in the Syrian opposition would counter that they had no choice but to accept foreign support if they were to defend themselves against the regime's brutality. But as the independent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/22/syria-opposition-led-astray-by-violence\" title=\"\">opposition leader Haytham Manna argues</a>, the militarisation of the uprising weakened its popular and democratic base \u2013 while also dramatically increasing the death toll.</p> <p>There is every chance the war could now spread outside Syria. Turkey, with a large Alawite population of its own as well as a long repressed Kurdish minority, claimed the right to <a href=\"http://blogs.channel4.com/alex-thomsons-view/international-relations-unravelling-syrian-borders/2493\" title=\"\">intervene against Kurdish rebels in Syria</a> after Damascus pulled its troops out of Kurdish towns. Clashes triggered by the Syrian war have intensified in Lebanon.

But intervention in Syria is prolonging the conflict, rather than delivering a knockout blow.

  "<p>What does all this money, in the most well-funded presidential race ever, buy?</p> <p>There's the $750m for the president; $800m for Mitt Romney; and then there's a couple of hundred more in Super Pac funds.</p> <p>What do the people putting up all this dough in politics actually get? Or maybe a better question: how do people keep falling for this?</p> <p>Here are the political contributions I have made:</p> <p>I have a Democratic private equity friend in Massachusetts who set out to build a political career. He was richer than me by a factor of probably 100, and yet, as reliably as the rain, he was back over and over again to ask for checks. (I'd once heard that the governor of Massachusetts could get anyone he wanted into Harvard, so I told myself I wrote these checks for my children.) But he never won \u2013 and yet, unfortunately, and on my dime, he persisted. I wrote check after check so he could run, and lose, and come back for more.</p> <p>My other check was to Bill Clinton in 1992. I wanted something specific: a blurb for a book I had written. I knew a top fundraiser for the campaign who said that if I maxed out the individual contribution, he'd take my request for a blurb directly to the candidate \u2013 done deal, he said. The last time I saw him, he was putting my folded check into his wallet.</p> <p>The next day, he was, tragically, killed in a plane crash. But not before having deposited my check. So, no blurb and no thank you \u2013 but, along with thousands of others, I did get my one-and-only inaugural invitation.</p> <p>Sheldon Adelson has been one of the big spenders during this campaign (by some estimates, his spend may go to $100m), first for Newt Gingrich, and now for Romney, accompanying the Republican candidate and his entourage on their recent trip to Israel. This might be what Adelson wants: some big-man travel, some personal press, a sense of bully-boy insinuation into Israel-US relations, some faith-based pride. But does he get real influence? </p> <p>It surely doesn't seem like a match: the self-made Jewish gambling magnate and the upper-class Mormon teetotaler. Let's be practical: what Adelson becomes, with his political investment, is a monster pain in the ass for the Romney people. Politicians spend the same amount of time raising money as they do giving the slip to the people who gave it to them. Precisely because Adelson will think he's owed big, he'll be avoided, mocked, handled, by a Romney White House (if it comes to that). Dollars to donuts, bitterness is what Adelson will get.</p> <p>Still, at his age and with his $25bn, it may be something of a cheap and final public splash for him (many of the biggest campaign donors are old men). But even here, I'll bet this turns to ash: there isn't much press for donors <em>after</em> an election. (But, count on it, he'll keep getting called for more money.)</p> <p>Do Romney's Bain supporters fair better? Or is Romney the burden they uniquely bear?</p> <p>The strategy for all the private equity guys I have known \u2013 unless, like my friend, and like Mitt Romney, they want to get into politics \u2013 is to fly under the radar. Press isn't good for private equity. As President Obama is now betting, there's really no way for most people to understand the PE business \u2013 and even less of a chance that they will be sympathetic to it. So, even if Romney wins, and private equity gets a finance-friendly White House, what it has also bought with its millions of dollars in support is a vastly increased branding problem.</p> <p>Still, for donors, there is the feeling of engagement in a great national contest, isn't there? Contributing a few dollars, or a few thousand dollars \u2013 or, if you have billions, its many-millions equivalent \u2013 represents a kind of interactivity. You're part of the whole. You signify. You've reached out. You matter.</p> <p>It's like posting a comment on the internet. And yet, really, how many commenters seem like satisfied and mellow people? Rather, engagement of this sort seems demonstrably an activity of the angry, hostile, begrudging, and dyspeptic. My guess is that what animates an internet commenter is very similar to what compels most campaign contributors to write a check: I give because I'm mad. Clearly, all campaign advertising strategies are guided by the premise that the negative is a stronger call to action than the positive. </p> <p>Politics is the province of the unhappy and querulous; perhaps all the more so because, having paid, people feel particularly gypped. (Or having paid, they feel they are entitled to their self-expression.) The manifest disappointment many of Barack Obama's 2008 supporters feel is surely heightened by the fact that, in that great surge of small contributions, they had to pay for the privilege.</p> <p>But somebody must get something valuable out of this $2bn election, besides the man who gets elected.</p> <p>This is the point where the analysis of campaign financing may well go seriously astray, seeing the underlying purpose of the $2bn as buying some insidious and indirect influence, instead of looking at exactly who is pocketing the cash and hence promoting the game. </p> <p>First off, there is the media. Presidential politics has become the difference between profit and loss for many television stations in battlefield states (most of them owned by major media companies). If you look at who has the largest financial interest in maintaining the hostility and partisan divide of modern politics, it is the media business. A curious conflict: the media stokes the fires of political acrimony while directly profiting from it.</p> <p>And second, there are the people who buy the media. Standing between the campaign donor and the recipient, there are the people who actually spend all this money. In most instances, they get a cut of it: a percentage of the ad buy (usually between 8% and 15%) goes to them. This is the political operative business: the outside consultants attached to every campaign (at almost every level of politics), and, now as well, the Super Pacs making big media buys around the country. (In other words, the Super Pacs are now very profitable businesses.)</p> <p>Karl Rove is not helping to run the American Crossroads Super Pac for free. In essence, the people who define the battleground states \u2013 the more money that's spent, the greater the contest \u2013 and who determine the tone of the campaign, and who set the budget requirements, are the people who most directly benefit from the campaign spend.</p> <p>Everybody else gets much less than they expected.</p>",
  "<p>So Stuart Jeffries, in a dig at Britain in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/aug/03/london-2012-olympics-blubbing-emotion?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">his summary of the Olympic Games</a> (4 August), has become accustomed \u2026 to loathing this \u2026 country \u2013 its meanness, racism, imperial shame \u2026 mediocre royals\". Why does he stay if he hates us so? The racism jibe is particularly hurtful \u2013 and s urely, in its generalisation, racist itself. True, there'll always be the ignorant and abusive, but from living on the multicultural east side of London, I know that for every bigot there are others who celebrate and champion diversity and equality, and many more who, quite frankly, aren't that bothered one way or another. How else to explain, despite nearly 70 years of mass immigration, the lack of race riots, supremacist paramilitary organisations, deliberate ethnic or religious ghettoisation (class is another matter), discriminatory legislation, segregated services, or widespread and persistent support for fascist parties?</p> <p>As for imperial shame, I know of no one who now thinks empire was a good thing. Many of my acquaintances whose families came from ex-colonies bear no ill will towards the British empire. Nor do they see this country as mean, racist, imperialist or backward-looking, but as a place of opportunity. Many even adore the royal family (though I'm on Stuart Jeffries's side on that one). I'm no flag-waving little Englander, or Tory supporter. I just find it odd that so many of those on the left have ended up, in Jeffries's words, loathing this country \u2013 or rather, many of its people. <br><strong>Karen Lane</strong><br><em>Ilford, Essex</em></p> <p>\u2022 Not rivers of blood, but rivers of gold (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/06/london-2012-british-racial-attitudes?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Hugh Muir</a>, 7 August)<br><strong>Tony Hirst</strong><br><em>Darwen, Lancashire</em></p>",
  "<p>Harriet Harman's assertion that \"If we had known then what we know now, we would not have allowed this [deregulation of betting shops and one-armed bandits]\" rings hollow among those who predicted that it would end up \"ruining the high street (and) ruining people's lives\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/05/labour-mistake-gambling-law-harman?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Labour's betting laws ruin lives, Harman says</a>, 6 August). Significantly, this deregulation was an example of New Labour's centralising control of policy which ensured there was no discussion of the issue at local branch, constituency or national conference level, wherein experienced members close to their communities could have pointed out the reasons for the labour movement's longstanding opposition to the gambling industry's pernicious effect on working communities.</p> <p>Rather, the metropolitan elite, who now claim to represent the common man and woman, listened to the siren voices of the gambling industry and its sponsored \"experts\" in academia, with its promises of high returns to the exchequer and of that phrase which has hidden so many ills: \"freedom of choice\".

  "<p>\u2022 A correction to a picture caption said we should not have described Jerusalem as the Israeli capital. It went on to relay the advice in our style guide that the capital was Tel Aviv. In 1980 the Israeli Knesset enacted a law designating the city of Jerusalem, including East Jerusalem, as the country's capital. In response, the UN security council issued resolution 478, censuring the \"change in character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem\" and calling on all member states with diplomatic missions in the city to withdraw. The UN has reaffirmed this position on several occasions, and almost every country now has its embassy in Tel Aviv. While it was therefore right to issue a correction to make clear Israel's designation of Jerusalem as its capital is not recognised by the international community, we accept that it is wrong to state that Tel Aviv \u2013 the country's financial and diplomatic centre \u2013 is the capital.

  "<p>The reactions to London's latest mega-structure have not been moderate. \"The Shard has slashed the face of London forever,\" wrote <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/03/shard-slashed-the-face-of-london\" title=\"\">Simon Jenkins in the Guardian a month ago</a>, invoking the destruction of Timbuktu, Dresden, Moscow and Peking, not to mention the bulldozing of the great Buddhas of Afghanistan. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/19/shard-london-skyscraper\" title=\"\">Jonathan Jones, the Guardian's art critic, has described the Shard as</a> \"self-evidently a monument to wealth and power run way out of control. It screams with dazzling arrogance that money rules this city and says money inhabits a realm way above our heads.\"</p> <p>But when have great buildings and structures \u2013 since the pyramids of Egypt and before \u2013 been anything other than monuments to wealth and power? The fact is that, in recent decades, in this country and all over the world, power has resulted in many vulgar and nasty blots on the landscape. London, of course, was terribly damaged during the second world war. Bomb sites scarred the city and, for the most part, what has come to replace them has been pretty abominable architecturally, with only a few honourable and sporadic exceptions. Any sensitive person crossing the Thames on Norman Foster's pedestrian bridge, looking left and right towards Christopher Wren's Baroque masterpiece, can only want to put on blinkers. Nasty skyscrapers have been built all over the West End and the City of London, from Centrepoint to the former NatWest Tower, not to mention London's Barbican. Here, many wonderful cultural events take place, but it can only be described as a city planning monstrosity. Think too of the expensively hideous Portcullis House, built to house the offices of our MPs next to the beautiful fantasy of Westminster Palace.</p> <p>Finally, along comes something that is genuinely magnificent to look at \u2013 namely the Shard, as it has affectionately come to be known. I don't care about its function or who built it, or even who financed it. It is a masterpiece of visual design by one of the great living architects, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/renzo-piano\" title=\"\">Renzo Piano</a>.</p> <p>Elegant and as inspiring to look at as a great cathedral, I keep discovering it from all sides \u2013 near and far. Its apparently broken apex makes for one astonishingly poetic image. As a pure glass edifice it resembles the most amazing cut diamond, both by day in the sunshine and at night lit up as a beacon over the city, as thrilling as the Eiffel Tower in Paris \u2013 which was also hated by establishment figures when it first went up. Now we cannot imagine Paris without it. I cannot now imagine London without the Shard and would go so far as to say that it is arguably the greatest and most beautifully skyreaching building to be erected in London since St Paul's Cathedral.</p> <p>Critics who profess to be concerned with London and the way it looks would spend their energy better if they were to turn their attention to those ghastly sculptures mushrooming up all over the city's squares and parks. The idea of walking around Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens now fills me with horror as my eyes are continually assaulted by absurd and corrupt objects such as the <a href=\"http://www.demotix.com/news/statue-horses-head-appears-marble-arch-london#slide-2\" title=\"\">horse's head at Marble Arch</a>, not to mention the stupid <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/m_j_b/5260851177/\" title=\"\">jelly babies</a> nearby, or the monument to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animals_in_War_Memorial\" title=\"\">poor animals killed in the two world wars</a>.</p> <p>The beautiful <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2011/nov/07/royal-artillery-memorial-english-heritage\" title=\"\">Royal Artillery Memorial</a> of Sargeant Jagger has been horribly upstaged by a succession of hideous monuments commemorating fallen heroes of the Commonwealth, most recently a ghastly parody of the beautiful screen of Decimus Burton next to Apsley House. One can argue about the rights and wrongs of erecting a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/29/bomber-command-memorial-artistic-jingoism?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">monument to Bomber Harris</a>, who in the understandable hysteria of the second world war caused, among other things, the destruction of the beautiful city of Dresden. What one can also argue, if one has any aesthetic sensibility, is that the retrograde and cheap monument, which is impossible to overlook as one passes through Hyde Park Corner, is the most ghastly eyesore and should have been prevented.</p> <p>In the meantime, one can only be grateful that at least the Shard is here to give continual visual pleasure from all aspects and distances across town.

  "<p>Few issues will seem as remote to most people in Britain, right now, as the Scottish independence referendum. Partly, that is because the Scottish government does not wish to have the vote until autumn 2014, which is more than two years away; partly, it is because the issue of Scotland's separation from the rest of Britain is not a priority for many voters, even in Scotland. But the sense of unreality is unusually strong right now because the Olympics have underlined \u2013 with Edinburgh's Sir Chris Hoy's second gold medal adding to the mood yesterday \u2013 just how comfortable the majority of the public feels with this hugely rewarding, shared aspect of our British identity.</p> <p>Yet the clock is ticking towards the referendum all the same. And it is high time that the Scottish and UK governments showed a greater sense of urgency towards settling some of the terms on which the referendum is held. Yet there is little sign of that from either Edinburgh or London at the moment. Both governments put forward opening bids about the terms some months ago. Alex Salmond's<a href=\" http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/0038/00386123.pdf\" title=\"\"> nationalist Scottish government </a>wants to drag the issue out, wants a multi-question ballot paper and refuses to allow London to have any authority over the poll; David Cameron's coalition British government <a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/transcript-pm-scotland-speech/ wants\" title=\"\">wants an early vote</a>, demands a single in-out question and seeks Edinburgh's recognition that the referendum must comply with existing constitutional law. Since then, however, there has been little engagement.</p> <p>Mr Salmond is playing the long game because he does not have enough support for independence \u2013 the polls remain solidly against the idea. The SNP is therefore hoping for something to turn up which will turn the mood in favour of independence. Mr Cameron, aware of Conservative unpopularity in Scotland, is reluctant to be drawn into a process which might offer such political rewards to the nationalists. The result is a stand-off, in which too much of the necessary debate about independence versus the union is being played out on surrogate issues.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Westminster's <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmscotaf/542/542.pdf\" title=\"\">Scottish affairs committee </a> tried to break the logjam on one of the most important of these. MPs believe that the nationalists should concede that the Holyrood parliament has no legal authority to call the planned referendum. They want London to hand Holyrood the necessary powers so that the vote, when it comes, is \"legally and morally watertight\". This is certainly essential. If Holyrood calls the referendum without such legal authority, it is certain to be challenged in the courts. No one wants the issue of independence to be decided anywhere except in the ballot box. The two governments should stop playing cat and mouse on these issues. Unfortunately, there is little sign of that.</p>",
  "<p>Fran Abrams singled out the cleaning industry for criticism, citing \"big corporates\" who \"rip off the vulnerable\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/09/cleaners-living-wage-protest\" title=\"\">They do the dirtiest jobs</a>, 10 July). The truth, however, is much more complicated than this and no amount of \"undercover cleaner\" expos\u00e9s will ever give the full picture.</p> <p>Abrams gives a solitary example of when \"the wage slip didn't add up or compulsory overtime wasn't paid\" to draw conclusions about the whole industry.</p> <p>In our experience, examples of such behaviour are extremely rare, and as the largest trade association for the contract cleaning industry, adherence to employment law is an absolute minimum prerequisite for all our members. Abrams then complains that cleaners are being subjected to \"the threat of redundancies and swingeing cuts in hours\", as if the cleaning industry is a special case. As the UK economy languishes in its longest, deepest post-war recession, are there any industries that are not facing difficult decisions towards their staff?</p> <p>The truth is that the contract cleaning industry wants to be able to provide better conditions for its workers. My organisation, the Cleaning and Support Services Association, has a long history of supporting the living wage \u2013 we have enjoyed a close working relationship with those Abrams calls \"great organisations\", such as <a href=\"http://www.citizensuk.org/\" title=\"\">London Citizens</a>, and have introduced their campaigners to many cleaning contractors and their clients. But our industry experience shows that for living wages to be successfully implemented, three things need to happen.</p> <p>The first is that from a client perspective, the contractor needs sufficient time to deliver the improved value a living wage contract can bring. Abrams' rejection of \"persuasion\" in favour of instant results is simply not realistic. Changing a contract needs careful planning and implementation, and the key benefits of the living wage, such as reduced employee churn and HR costs, need to be given time to materialise.</p> <p>Second, if the client needs time to make wage increases, then so do employees. Paying a living wage cannot simply be about making the existing labour costs more expensive \u2013 work needs to be reorganised to be able to deliver better value and better productivity. Employees need to accept this as part of the process, rather than fighting it every step of the way.</p> <p>Third, cleaning contractors have to take responsibility as well. They should be the catalyst for bringing together the needs of clients and employees into a single sustainable package that offers better value and conditions for all parties. The contractor also bears the primary responsibility for implementation, although success will depend on the support and cooperation of the client and workforce.</p> <p>When all parties work together in this way, a living wage can be achieved. Since 2001, over 100 businesses in London have been accredited as living wage employers \u2013 Abrams's claim that \"little has changed\" in the past 10 years is patently false. Her one-sided article helps no-one. Implementing the living wage is not easy, and requires the full support of clients, contractors and employees to make the changes required, but it can be done. So let's stop arguing and start working together to make it happen.</p>",
  "<p>Back in the not so distant days of 2008, the City blazed, but two towers of banking stood in splendid isolation from the inferno. As Lloyds, RBS and HBOS flared up and tumbled, neither HSBC nor Standard Chartered felt obliged to call 999, largely because both did so much of their business at a safe distance from British shores. Something of a halo has hovered above StandChart, in particular, ever since. Only last week, Richard Meddings, the finance director, was being <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/08/01/stanchart-barclays-ceo-idUKL6E8J1JWY20120801\" title=\"\">talked up as the man to salvage the battered standing</a> of Barclays, while StandChart's chief executive, Peter Sands, was being spoken of in connection with the governorship of the Bank of England. But after HSBC was beset by one scandal a fortnight ago, on Monday American regulators dragged the name of StandChart into the mud. Dealings a long way from home no longer look like such a sure way of safeguarding a reputation in banking.</p> <p>It did not take long after the initial catastrophe for the country to cotton on that all those CDSs, CDOs and other acronyms were little more than a complex code to conceal big bets being placed with other people's money. It was, after all, hard not to notice, seeing as the rest of us were left footing the bill when things went wrong. The initial conclusion in respectable circles was not that the financiers had flouted the rules exactly, but rather that they had used big brains and ruthless cunning to enrich themselves by working around them. The Guardian's revelations about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/17/barclays-tax-secret-documents\" title=\"\">complex web of arrangements through which Barclays avoided tax</a> while sticking on the right side of the law epitomised the perception.</p> <p>After Barclays was fined \u00a3290m in June for fibbing about the market's readiness to lend it money, the so-called Libor-rigging scandal, the old narrative about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/02/more-lie-than-bore-editorial\" title=\"\">\"cunning law-abiders\"</a> began to give way to muttering about \"<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21558260\" title=\"\">banksters</a>\". Rumbling along in the background at this time were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/13/jp-morgan-doubles-reported-loss\" title=\"\">JP Morgan's dodgy dealings in London</a>, RBS's busted computers that briefly <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19107537\" title=\"\">separated customers from their accounts</a> and the continuing saga of mis-sold payment protection insurance. So the reputation of banking had hit a new low even before <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-18993476\" title=\"\">HSBC's $27.5m fine</a> in connection with the laundering of Mexican drug money a fortnight ago. Then \u2013 late on Monday \u2013 a <a href=\"http://www.dfs.ny.gov/banking/ea120806.pdf\" title=\"\">dossier of allegations</a> from the New York State Department of Financial Services accused Standard Chartered of breaking American sanctions by concealing some $250bn of transactions with Iran.</p> <p>StandChart <a href=\"http://www.standardchartered.com/en/news-and-media/news/global/2012-08-06-response-to-NY-State-Department-comments.html\" title=\"\">strenuously denies</a> \"the portrayal of facts\" given by the New York watchdog, only one of several regulators. It is also worth pointing out that the fiery condemnation of this business, which was born out of the marriage of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19161362\" title=\"\">two venerable banks of the Victorian Empire</a>, as a \"rogue institution\" is very much of a piece with a mercantilist instinct in American regulation, which has often resulted in foreign-based businesses being more aggressively interrogated than those listed in the US. Even so, the charges look serious, and \u2013 in wiping 16% off the bank's value on Tuesday \u2013 the markets let it be known that they were less than convinced by the late-night response that StandChart eventually scrambled together several hours after the news dropped.</p> <p>We must wait to see how the stand-off between aggressive regulator and defiant bank plays out, but what's clear is that these allegations come at the worst possible time for the City. Its traditional motto is \"my word is my bond\", but today New York congresswoman Carolyn Maloney can claim that \"every big trading disaster happens in London\". She may have her own reasons, but if this view takes hold, it will have sweeping implications. This is a nation whose governments have routinely failed to distinguish between the interests of the City and those of the broader population, and have allowed negotiating hands in the EU to be dictated by financial interests, as is seen with the UK's resistance to a Tobin tax. Alienation from the Square Mile has been building for some time, but such is the sense that standards have slipped that the City's ancient charters no longer command any respect.</p>",
  "<p>It was 1987 when I started drinking Diet Coke. It only dawns on me now how fashion forward this was, considering it had been invented just five years before (the other drink I took to this same year, beer, had been discovered in early Neolithic times). Although it would be an exaggeration to say that everyone at my school was anorexic, I do remember someone trying to find out how many calories were in human flesh, because she'd just absent-mindedly chewed some skin off her thumb (this was before Google). To drink Fat Coke in an atmosphere like that would have been a gesture of defiance. Which was fine, people made those, even in the 80s, but you had to be really thin. Otherwise you just looked as though you had no control.</p> <p>Diet Coke celebrates its 30th birthday this year, as the second most popular soda in the world, after Coke. This placement happened in 2010, and was a cataclysmic fizzy-pop event, a diet drink outstripping a full-fat drink \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2011/03/18/diet-coke-overtakes-pepsi-number-spot/\">Pepsi, formerly the second most popular</a>. Finally, at 28 years old, Diet Coke's wish had come true \u2013 people were drinking it just for the taste. Sales in Britain have gone up 6% in the past five years; 40% of colas sold are either Diet Coke or Coke Zero.</p> <p>Like anything else whose only imaginable ingredient is carbonated water (can you picture aspartame? Acesulfame K?), it comes in for a certain amount of mistrust, ranging from real health anxieties (we'll get to those) to a sniffy, \"if they don't sell it in Monmouth Coffee Company, I'm not drinking it\" disapproval. It will never meet that test of the wholesome foodstuff (would your grandmother know what it was?) and it will never be rehabilitated by a <a href=\"http://www.nigella.com/recipes/view/ham-in-coca-cola-171\">Nigella recipe</a> (unlike Coke and even Cherry Coke, which can both be used to bake ham). There has always been a slight shame attached to it, since \u2013 with the caffeine, and that sheer unknowable lift \u2013 it bespoke an addiction that couldn't be hidden behind a connoisseurship, unlike alcohol or coffee. You'll never be a connoisseur about something that's mass produced and always tastes the same. (In fact, this isn't true of Diet Coke \u2013 there's a different recipe for some parts of the Mediterranean market, and it isn't as nice. Still, \"nice\" and \"not as nice\" \u2013 there is not enough stratification here.) In the 80s, it was too new to be cool. So it was very uncool not to drink it, but it wasn't totally cool to drink it either.</p> <p>Diet Coke had another stroke of genius in the middle of the decade. Its first stroke of genius was changing its name from Tab, which had been the name of the Coke diet-variant since the 60s. They hadn't wanted to use \"diet\" in the title originally, since they didn't want the drink to be associated with self-denial. In fact, you can associate a diet drink with almost any negative idea or trait (look at Diet Tango's sell line \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUAYZDMD0-o\">\"you need it because you're weak\"</a>) and people will still drink it, because it's fizzy. But nobody knew that to begin with. The other problem with the \"diet\" concept is that it locks the drink pretty firmly to one gender, which is a needless waste \u2013 in terms of marketing opportunities \u2013 of the other gender. This started out true and remained so for years \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/dynamic/press_center/2010/09/happy-birthday-coke-zero.html\">Coke Zero was introduced as late as 2005</a> to appeal to the men who liked the taste and idea of zero calories, but didn't want to look like those kinds of men (women). Coke Zero seemed like a failure because nobody stopped consuming Diet Coke to drink it; in fact, it took off; the public embraced it as a totally separate drink. If they'd written that on a strategy document \u2013 we're going to make the same drink, with very slightly different ratios of wholly artificial taste-simulators, give it a nakedly manipulative name and hope to sell it without denting the sales of its diet prototype - I like to think they'd have been laughed out of a job.</p> <p>Anyway, it wasn't an entirely necessary invention because a decade before Diet Coke had had its second stroke of genius which made the drink such a universal that it became unisex. In 1983 it bought Columbia Pictures, pioneering the idea of product placement, which led to the Coke-chasm, where the nation at large drank more and more regular Coke, and the inhabitants of Hollywood, like an aneurysm in America's bloodstream, drank more and more Diet Coke, to the point where, in 1988, it was almost the drink of choice at the Governor's Ball following the Oscars (it was eschewed in the end, in favour of booze. You can embrace aspartame as throatily as you wish, but you cannot pretend it makes you drunk). The upshot of this is that America as a whole has become larger and larger, while its stars have become smaller and smaller, to the point that if you put Teri Hatcher next to a regular person, you'd have to assume she belonged to a different species.</p> <p>That was just a flight of fancy. Teri Hatcher would never stand next to a normal person for fear of catching normality. And there is no evidence that Diet Coke actually makes you thin, though <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2161715/Could-diet-soda-make-fat-How-zero-calorie-sweeteners-trick-brain-thinking-youre-hungry-youre-not.html\">attempts by the media to prove that it makes you fat</a> have come to nothing. There have been studies showing that people who drink a lot of diet soda generally (not Diet Coke in particular) have larger waist circumferences, but none prove cause and effect. However, as amusing as it is to think of the discovery \u2013 maybe it will arrive in time for the half centenary \u2013 that Diet Coke makes you fat, there are other health scares which, if true, would be much more troubling.</p> <p>Aspartame, like every other chemical or activity that is peculiar to modern life, has been thoroughly investigated as a possible cause of cancer, diabetes, heart disease, fertility problems; at the moment there's just nothing in it. But in the world where products are tested, and there are agencies of food standards, and there are rules about who can sell what to whom, on the grounds of health the only serious recommendation ever made was that you shouldn't drink more than 18 cans of aspartame-containing drink a day. I was drinking a Diet Coke when I met Carole Caplin once, and she said, \"It's osteoporosis in a can, you know\". But she wasn't talking about diet drinks, she was talking about any carbonated drink \u2013 the bubbles irritate your stomach, your stomach responds by producing alkaline, which most likely it will get from the calcium in your bones. I know someone who gave himself osteoporosis by eating nothing for three years but baked beans poured over pasta. I'm just saying, there are a lot of ways to give yourself a bone disease, and they are not all as enjoyable as Diet Coke.</p> <p>In the absence of any damning evidence, Diet Coke now occupies that twilight zone \u2013 along with dairy, wheat and Snack-a-Jacks. There's nothing actively wrong with them, but if you feel your body is a temple, you won't let them in it. Understanding this, in 2007, DC (that's what they call it in America) launched <a href=\"http://m.dietcoke.com/about-diet-coke/our-products.jsp\">Diet Coke Plus</a>. It was all the fun of the chemicals, with added nutrients. Nutritionists didn't get it \u2013 why would you need vitamins in your drink? Why couldn't you just take vitamins with your drink? If everybody thought like that, they'd never have invented the cocktail. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Diet Plus went nowhere. People didn't want vitamins in their drink, because the last thing you want to be reminded of while you're drinking artificial sweetener is the health-giving bounty of the natural world. If I had to accompany Diet Coke with anything, I'd want it to be freeze dried space food. Personally, I favour the drink when I have drunk so much coffee that it feels morally wrong to drink any more. Since Diet Coke has caffeine in it as well, this is an irrational measure, but no less irrational than the people who drink it when they want some sugar but don't want the calories, and then go ahead and have a bar of chocolate as well.</p> <p>The appeal of the drink in public life is, I believe, for the sorts of people who aren't allowed to have a visible vice to show that they have the devil in them somewhere. <a href=\"http://celebritiesdrinkingdietcoke.tumblr.com/post/24608449833/former-president-bill-clinton-enjoys-a-nice-can-of\">Bill Clinton famously loved Diet Coke</a> (in fairness to him, he had no need to manifest his saturnine desires with a soft drink. So he just probably likes the taste). <a href=\"http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/barack-obama?before=1338303990\">Barack Obama loves it</a> (I like to think it's something he wishes he didn't drink. You can't imagine in his best self, when he and Michelle get together to work out their weight targets for the year, pledging to drink more Diet Coke). Furthermore, in the UK at least, it is the mark of the metrosexual (for men) and the mark of the slut (for women \u2013 I mean slut in the older sense, of being a bit ramshackle around the house). I'm not making any statement about the economy or about Iraq, OK, but I cannot imagine Gordon Brown knowing one end of a Diet Coke from another, whereas I can imagine Tony Blair (and Alastair Campbell) drinking it quite a lot, Carole Caplin's reservations notwithstanding. Since you ask, David Cameron drinks Beefeater triples and Nick Clegg drinks Schloer. Still in my imagination.</p> <p>In real life, accidental endorsements and the atmospheric support of Hollywood have always served Diet Coke better than its chosen celebrities, whom it gets wrong (Paula Abdul). This doesn't mean they've never had a good advert: I'm thinking specifically (only) of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdrE1VMxzoE\">Diet Coke break</a>, in which a number of women gather round to watch a male construction worker, who always removes his shirt at 11.30am, the better to enjoy his Diet Coke. The women aren't drinking, they're just looking; there are a few of them, so it's much more like the appropriation of a male sexual fantasy (group ogling, a kind of fellowship in desire) than it is a classic female one (which tends to be one woman fixed on one man). It's meant to be witty (reversal of expectation), and modern (sisters are doing it for themselves), but it had the apparently unintended consequence of making men think: \"Huh. There's a man drinking a woman's drink, and it looks&#xa0;like he's really enjoying it!\"</p> <p>Plenty of people never came round to the taste of it, and they would see it as one of the punishments of self-improvement, along with sugar-free jelly and cottage cheese. They will see its 30th birthday as a mystery of marketing, a baffling triumph of habit and gullibility over sense, health, reputation, gender-expectation (in some cases) and taste. Everybody else will understand how it came of age \u2013 it's because it's delicious.</p> <h2>'Diet drinks have no nutritional value': the nutritionist's view<br></h2> <p>Diet drinks are very processed substances and can contain a high amount of caffeine, which works as a diuretic on the body, leading to significant losses of water. This causes dehydration, while various nutrients \u2013 including calcium, magnesium, and vitamins B and C \u2013 can be lost through urine. My second concern relates to the phosphoric acid preservative in them, which creates phosphates in the body. These can reduce the absorption of calcium in the gut, and can trigger the parathyroid gland to cause the release of calcium from bones, both of which can contribute to poor bone density. Diet drinks have no nutritional value.</p> <p>Artificial sweeteners are a very controversial subject. Some governmental health authorities may say they are safe enough, but in the nutrition industry, that's still up for debate. Some studies indicate that the man-made molecular structure of some artificial sweeteners could be linked to certain health problems. This requires much more research. Research however, has indicated other adverse issues from consumption of artificial sweeteners, including encouraging sugar cravings; and increasing appetite. Replacing sugary drinks with diet drinks doesn't help to reduce weight by itself. In fact, some epidemiologic data suggests a positive correlation between artificial sweetener usage and weight gain. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2892765/\" title=\"\">Recent research</a> suggests that water promotes weight loss better than diet drinks, as well as improving blood pressure and hydration levels.</p> <p><em>Anne-France Rix is a nutritional therapist (www.TheFoodDoctor.com).

  "<p>Do not adjust your medal table: this really is happening. Beleaguered by security blather, troubled at times by its own unfathomable ticket regime, the London 2012 Olympic Games has now delivered gloriously and unanswerably where it really matters.</p> <p>Gold medals on Tuesday afternoon in triathlon, dressage and \u2013 you again? \u2013 cycling, took Britain's medal table tally decisively past the 19 golds achieved in Beijing four years ago. It is the best British gold medal tally at any Olympics since London's White City Games in 1908, when deer shooting and the tug of war were among the medals on offer. To give a more telling perspective on a vertiginous achievement, as recently as the 1996 Atlanta Games, Britain won just a single gold \u2013 in rowing.</p> <p>After a weekend of giddily received track and field success, the start of the Games' final week had already brought a reprise of that rather disorientating golden glow. Monday's equine and cycle-based exploits had left the gold tally just one short of Beijing's intoxicatingly grand haul overnight. Such are Team GB's current riches that the card for Tuesday's Olympic competition almost felt like a race within a race, a sprint for the wire to claim that historic 20th gold medal.</p> <p>In the event it was the triathlete <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/07/london-2012-brownlees-triathlon-success\" title=\"\">Alistair Brownlee who won the gold that equalled the modern record</a>, taking first place in Hyde Park ahead of his brother Johnny. It was a fitting triumph at these Games, an event staged in the heart of London in front of 200,000 ticketed and unticketed spectators, and taking in one of the few open active green spaces in the heart of this cramped and burdened, but still seethingly sport-centric city. Brownlee's was a hugely popular 19th gold after an awesome display of endurance athletics by the 24-year-old Yorkshireman. Despite slowing slightly to bask in the applause his time for the 10,000 metres was just 80 seconds down on Mo Farah's gold-medal winning effort in Stratford on Saturday. Mind you, Brownlee had just swum 1500m and cycled a marathon.</p> <p>And then all eyes turned to the Velodrome at the Olympic Park, that gorgeous piece of urban sporting design with its flipped-pancake roof and alluring coil of lacquered pine track. It is the most striking emblem of the reinvigoration of British Olympic sport. With newly enthroned two-wheel royalty Sir Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton both in action in the afternoon there would surely be no more fitting stage for the cracking of the 20-gold barrier.</p> <p>Except it didn't turn out like that. Instead, three miles south in the shadow of the Queen's house in Greenwich Park it was the British dressage team who surged through to take the decisive gold. There are those who will suggest dressage, an affair of immaculately top-hatted sideways galloping, might not represent the most fitting symbol of an Olympic sporting legacy. They might perhaps even opine that the likelihood that the streets of Britain will now be thronged with boys and girls parading their show-horses up and down the kerbs until teatime is remote. But this was a genuinely fine achievement, a first ever gold in this most exacting of horse-based disciplines.</p> <p>It is a common misconception that equine sports are only for the posh, the landed and the horsey, but many of the best riders are everyday people. The gold-winning dressage team featured the daughter of a German billionaire, a former farmhand from Sark and a woman from Enfield. Greenwich has been perhaps the most picturesque venue at these Olympics, a park designed for Henry VIII to hunt deer. There was a sense of jubilee-ish pageantry to the celebrations afterwards, with Princess Anne, who really does seem to have been lucky with her ticket application at these Games, leading the cheers.</p> <p>It was then time for the astonishingly accomplished British cycling team to begin putting clear water between London 2012 and the best efforts of four years ago. By 5.40pm there was a 21st rendition of the new dual national anthem - God Save The Queen followed by David Bowie's impossibly moving Heroes \u2013 at the Velodrome as Laura Trott won gold in the Omnium. This was a brilliantly nerveless victory for Trott, who beat the American Sarah Hammer in the final pursuit, a hugely popular second gold in London for the 20-year-old from Essex, who was born with a collapsed lung, later diagnosed with asthma, and who took up cycling on the advice of her doctor.</p> <p>Once again the world had turned a peculiar shade of British gold, the texture of Olympic sport so bizarrely altered at these Games that it was almost a shock when Victoria Pendleton was beaten by Australia's Anna Meares in the final of the women's sprint shortly after Trott's medal ceremony. Pendleton was consigned to taking a silver medal in the final race of her career. As she bowed in tears to all sides of the Velodrome there was, however, the consolation of departing as arguably the greatest British sportswoman ever, with her swag-bag of nine world championships and two Olympic gold medals.</p> <p>The obvious question, as Britain's sports fans peer, replete, down the Olympic medal table, waving to the lowly powerhouses of Germany and Australia, is how exactly did all this happen? As ever, the main reason is money, combined with a perfect storm of youthful talent in the right disciplines. It is no coincidence that improvement began almost immediately after Lottery funding was first introduced into Olympic sport a year after the single-gold Olympics of Atlanta. At the Sydney Games in 2000 Britain won 11 golds, as they did again in Athens in 2004. Then came Beijing, on the back of \u00a3235m investment in infrastructure and training over a four-year cycle.</p> <p>The numbers have been similar here. Combined with the stunning results of London 2012 it amounts to a very public triumph of funding, management and performance. For now the vexatious issues of legacy and the continuing sale of school sports fields can wait just a little bit. It has, after seven years of rather fraught Olympic preparation, been an extraordinarily golden six days.</p>",
  "<p>The Labour MP John Mann, an outspoken member of the Treasury select committee, has called for a government inquiry into money laundering, and outlined fears that US regulators have British banks in their sights as they try to shift business from London to New York.</p> <p>The allegations against Standard Chartered, made on Monday by the little-known New York state department of financial services, also prompted calls by the investment advisory agency Pirc for discussions with top bankers about the industry's ethics.</p> <p>One large shareholder in banking stocks warned that it was considering ditching all its investments in the sector in the wake of the Libor scandal and the money laundering allegations at HSBC \u2013 which were compounded by the allegations against Standard Chartered.</p> <p>The damning criticism of Standard Chartered, which intends to contest the claims that it worked with Iran, is another blow to the reputation of UK banking businesses, and is thought to be feeding prejudice in the US that the UK's regulators have allowed a \"wild west\" culture to become established.</p> <p>Mann, the MP for Bassetlaw, said he would request a government review into money laundering and \"an increasing anti-British bias by US regulators and politicians aimed at shifting financial markets from London to New York\".</p> <p>He said: \"I have no truck whatsoever with British banks profiteering from Iran and Burma, nor with US banks profiteering from drug and illegal arms money or the private accounts of world dictators. The British parliament should instigate an unbiased and far-reaching investigation into money laundering in Britain, involving British banks and endangering the wellbeing of British interests and the British people.\"</p> <p>The sharp fall in Standard Chartered shares demonstrated that the accusations were being taken seriously by investors, who last week were celebrating the 10th successive year of record profits at the bank, which though based in London specialises in emerging markets.</p> <p>\"Shareholders should now be thinking about industry-wide engagement to sort out the reputational and ethical crisis that is engulfing the UK banking sector,\" said the agency Pirc.</p> <p>Standard Chartered's share price was hit particularly hard by fears that the hitherto top-rated management team might be forced out by the allegations and worries that the bank would be at risk of losing its licence in the US.</p> <p>Banking analysts at Credit Suisse said that licences had not been revoked from other banks for similar offences, but acknowledged: \"The market is already concerned about litigation risk and regulatory issues in the sector, especially given recent events at Barclays and HSBC, so this does not help sentiment at a time when it is fragile.\"</p> <p>More details were being sought by investors and analysts, although the Credit Suisse analysts noted that Standard Chartered was not the first bank to encounter the wrath of US regulators over sanctions breaches.</p> <p>Lloyds TSB was fined $350m in September 2009, and Barclays $176m in August 2010, according to Credit Suisse. Other banks, such as the Dutch ING group and Wall Street's JP Morgan, have also had to pay big penalties.</p> <p>Gary Greenwood, banking analyst at Shore Capital, thought it was unlikely Standard Chartered would lose its US licence. \"A loss of its US banking licence would not only jeopardise part of this profit stream, but the associated reputational damage could also have a severely damaging impact to its operations within emerging markets \u2026 However, at this stage, we view this outcome to be unlikely.\"</p> <p>City analysts have been supporters of Standard Chartered shares throughout much of the financial crisis, which the bank survived without taxpayer bailouts.</p> <p>Even so Sandy Chen, at Cenkos Securities, who has recommended buying the shares for most of the past decade said he was downgrading to sell. \"We regard this as hugely damaging to its global franchise,\" he said.</p> <p>Mike Trippitt, an analyst at Oriel, cut his rating to \"reduce\" from \"buy\". He said: \"The tone and language of the report is quite shocking, but it was equally a very firm rebuttal from Standard Chartered to say it was acting lawfully and measuring what they think was outside the rules.\"</p> <p>There were also supporters. Ian Gordon, banking analyst at Investec, described the US regulators' move as \"unexpected and ferocious attack\".</p> <p>Gordon said: \"Standard Chartered is not an ordinary bank. It has a proud reputation, a management team of high integrity, and is known for its magnificent work with the charity Seeing is Believing. It is of grave concern to see its reputation sullied before the facts are known.\"</p> <p>Greenwood added: \"As is par for the course in these situations the spotlight will now fall on management, with the inevitable calls for heads to roll by politicians and the media alike. However, while not wishing to vindicate senior management in this issue, we believe a knee-jerk reaction of removing them is not the answer as it may only exacerbate the situation.</p> <p>\"We believe that the management team now needs to focus all of its efforts on mitigating the potential reputational damage.\"</p> <h2>Key players<br></h2> <p><strong>Peter Sands</strong></p> <p>Sands is one of the few bankers to remain at the top of their institution through the financial crisis after taking the top job in 2006. During his tenure, he more than doubled the number of employees from 28,000 to more than 80,00 and could seemingly do no wrong. He has been close to successive governments and used the bank's central London offices to host meetings with ministers and civil servants at the height of the downturn, creating the scheme for taxpayers to save RBS, HBOS and Lloyds. His reputation surged, helped by the decision to waive his \u00a32m bonus in 2010, and he had been mooted as the next governor of the Bank of England. More recently he was part of the review into university funding, which suggested fees rise to \u00a39,000-a-year, and is a non-executive director at the Department of Health.</p> <p><strong>Richard Meddings</strong></p> <p>The polite finance director had been one of the front-runners to replace Bob Diamond at the helm of Barclays. He worked there as group financial controller before joining Standard Chartered in 2002 and was finance director of Woolwich when it was bought by Barclays in 2000. At Standard Chartered the married father-of-three was group executive director responsible for risk, and is said to have been on a list of those warned by the bank's US chief executive about the potential problems in dealing with Iran in 2006. A month later he was named finance director. In 2008, amid the financial crisis he advised the government at the height of the financial crisis and more recently he has been fending off questions about whether the bank will move its HQ overseas.</p> <p><strong>Mervyn Davies</strong></p> <p>The fast-talking Welshman was a virtual unknown outside banking circles before he was named chief executive of Standard Chartered in 2001, having previously run the bank's Asian operation. The football and rugby fanatic, who started his career with the bank in 1993 after 10 years at Citibank, quickly built a solid reputation and impressed politicians. After five years as CEO, he was promoted to chairman in 2006 \u2013 in breach of corporate governance codes. Gordon Brown appointed him chairman of his Business Council for Britain in 2007 and at the height of the banking crisis Davies helped provide the outline to the bailout. He was given a life peerage and became trade minister under Lord Mandelson, although Brown was keen to make him RBS chairman. He is the government's board diversity czar and is calling for more women in boardrooms.</p> <p><strong>Benjamin Lawsky</strong></p> <p>The superintendent of financial services in New York State is a newly created role which Lawsky has taken to with aplomb.

With a ferocious work ethic and a talent for public relations, the 42-year-old grandson of refugees from Nazi Germany wanted to become an architect, but settled for law, prosecuting white collar crime, organised crime, and terrorism cases in New York. He says his objectives are \"keeping New York on the cutting edge as the financial capital of the world, protecting consumers better than ever before, and serving as a model of efficient government.\"</p> <p>Profiles by Simon Neville<strong> </strong></p>",
  "<p>After Phillips Idowu's failure to qualify for the triple jump final on Tuesday morning there will, inevitably, be people who come out and criticise him for how he managed his preparations ahead of these Games. Personally, I will not be one of them. I support him for doing things his own way. I admire him for being brave. He had his back against the wall and he did what he felt was right.</p> <p>Three or four weeks out from a major championships, if an athlete has a problem I believe he or she has the right to make their own decisions about which path to take. After all, they are the ones who have to go out and perform, not just in front of 80,000 spectators in the stadium, but in front of millions of people around the world.</p> <p>With the injury problems Phillips had there was always going to be a question mark over whether he could perform at these Games. As an elite athlete, you do not want to give your competitors an edge. Everybody knows that Phillips is the man to beat in the triple jump, he is always standing on the podium when the medals are being awarded, so why would he want to give his rivals an extra boost and confirm that he is not fully fit?</p> <p>I got worried when he came out and I noticed that his hair wasn't dyed. In the past he has always said that when he dyes his hair he is ready to perform. I know he had a funky mohican hairstyle, but that's not quite the same, so I did find myself wondering how he was feeling.</p> <p>Many people will no doubt say it was predictable that he did not perform better but it looked very close to me. The distances he posted were well below what he is capable of \u2013 16.47m and 16.53 when he needed 17.10 \u2013 but he had the first two phases of his jump bang on. If only he could have timed that last phase better I think he would have flown over the automatic qualification mark without a problem.</p> <p>In the end he was only 10cm away from a place in the final. Most importantly he said he was jumping pain free, which means that his physio plan worked. I was watching him very closely, and it seemed on a knife edge to me. Had he been able to nail that jump in qualifying I really believe he would have been dangerous in the final. But it did not work out.</p> <p>Had he qualified everyone would be saying: \"Good on you Phillips\", and wishing him well for the final. It just goes to show how those margins between success and failure are so narrow at this level.</p> <p>I think Phillips will be frustrated. As will all of the athletes whose competitions did not go right on a day that I have dubbed \"Terrible Tuesday\", after the highs of Super Saturday. Anyone who thinks an athlete gets over these things is wrong. You carry it with you for the rest of your life.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, coaches, friends and family will have their work cut out lifting all these disappointed athletes off the floor. Life does go on but if you have not performed in front of your home crowd it will feel like the end of the world. For those athletes to come back to an Olympic Village with medals all over the place, and walk among team-mates who are buzzing, it is very difficult to take.</p> <p>The closest I ever felt to that in my career was at the Commonwealth Games in Manchester. I was out-and-out favourite to win the gold medal, but I pushed myself so hard in training that I tore a hamstring and I didn't even get to the start line. Getting over such disappointments can take weeks, months or even years.</p> <p>But one bad competition does not make you a bad athlete. And it can happen to the very best in the world. We tend to focus only on the fortunes of British athletes, but look at what happened to the former world record holder Liu Xiang. Colin Jackson will tell you that the Chinese hurdler has the best technique in the world \u2013 and yet he came out in the first round and hit a hurdle. One mistake and his Olympic Games was over. It can happen to the very best in the world.</p> <p>If Phillips had gone to Portugal and done what everyone else wanted him to do things may still have turned out this way, but he would have had to lay blame elsewhere. At least he knows that he took control of the situation and made his own decisions.</p> <p>At the end of the day, the fact that people the world over wanted to know where Phillips was, how his injury was going and how he was likely to perform in the Olympic Games says everything about what an athlete he is. A superstar.</p>",
  "<p>Which is it? Is Standard Chartered a \"rogue institution\", as the New York state department of financial services alleges? Or is the new US body a rogue regulator led by a lawyer, Benjamin Lawsky, seeking to make his name in the style of Eliot Spitzer, one-time scourge of Wall Street before his downfall?</p> <p>It has to be one or the other because the positions of the two sides are miles apart. The New York DFS alleges that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/06/standard-chartered-iran-transactions\" title=\"\">Standard Chartered hid $250bn (\u00a3160bn) of transactions with the Iranian government</a> by falsifying records.</p> <p>The bank maintains Lawsky is talking rubbish. It says 99.9% of the transactions disclosed to regulators complied with the rules and that the infringements involve the relatively modest sum of $14m.</p> <p>Further, Standard Chartered asserts that the DFS's interpretation \"is incorrect as a matter of law\".</p> <p>An honourable draw isn't possible here. Consider the tussle as a head-to-head confrontation in the Olympic velodrome: somebody will win, somebody will be eliminated.</p> <p>The stock market's reaction was to knock 20% off Standard Chartered's share price. That's not investors prejudging the facts. They are just reflecting the possibility that, in a single blow, the bank could lose its reputation, a chunk of its senior management and its licence to process dollars in New York. The risk of a triple whammy may still be remote but it has to be priced.</p> <p>Standard Chartered, don't forget, is an institution that likes to think of itself as a cut above the rest. The reason it hasn't got into scrapes, management likes to proclaim loudly and often, is because it conducts itself properly.</p> <p>Consider this self-congratulatory statement by the chairman, Sir John Pease, only last week: \"In recent weeks, issues have surfaced around governance and behaviour in banking. At Standard Chartered, we believe it is not just about what we do, but how we do it. Our culture and values continue to be a source of strength and a competitive advantage. Strong corporate governance and an obsession with the basics of banking remain key areas of focus for our board.\"</p> <p>Pease, we must assume, would not have chosen to sound so puffed up if he had known that Lawsky was about to publish his explosive allegations. The timing is an unusual aspect of this tale. Scandals in banking-land or, rather, their revelation, tend to be choreographed when regulators become involved. The existence of an investigation is often known (and it was at Standard Chartered) but the details of the wrong-doing, the admission of fault and the nature of the punishment tend to be published simultaneously.</p> <p>That's how the plot worked with Barclays and Libor-rigging \u2013 the Financial Services Authority issued its final notice, imposed a \u00a3290m fine and the directors made a grovelling apology. Similarly, HSBC said sorry immediately when a US senate committee said the bank's lax systems had allowed drug cartels to launder money.</p> <p>In the Standard Chartered case, the choreography has collapsed. The bank complains that it was in discussions with five US agencies, including the US department of justice, and was surprised to receive the New York DFS's order. It grumbles that \"resolution of such matters normally proceeds through a co-ordinated approach by such agencies\".</p> <p>Fair point. So why did the DFS go public? It's not clear. Is Lawsky, who has argued that regulators do too much in secret, trying to maximise his profile and that of his 10-month-old department? Or was Standard Chartered deemed not to be co-operating with the investigation?</p> <p>Of more concern to Standard Chartered shareholders will be the size of the transactions involved: $250bn. The bank's two-sentence summary of the investigation in its recent results statement gave no hint that the affair could be that big or that regulators might seek to revoke the licence to operate in New York. Now they know. If the chief executive, Peter Sands, is to survive in his post, he needs to be vindicated in full.</p> <p>Mind you, Lord Davies, the lauded former chief executive and then chairman during the period under scrutiny, would also be dragged into the affair if Standard Chartered ends up paying a fine that investors might regard as tolerable \u2013 say, the $600m at which Dutch bank ING settled similar allegations.</p> <p>Such sums don't ruin profit and loss accounts at banks as successful as Standard Chartered \u2013 but they do undermine reputations.</p>",
  "<p>Egypt has a chronic sectarian problem, and the main obstacle to addressing it is official and popular denial that it has one.</p> <p>Following each sectarian conflagration the government in Cairo issues its customary denials and denunciations and sends a delegation of officials and elders to reconcile the Muslim and Coptic sides.</p> <p>It's a well-known routine that has with time become increasingly absurd and out of touch with reality. The problem has been known for some time and acknowledged by all sensible people in Egypt, but apart from the rhetoric, no concrete steps have been taken to defuse it.</p> <p>Egypt should apply the law to everyone and stop treating sectarian violence as a minor fight between brothers that is best kept within the family.</p> <p>Last week's flare-up was classic: a banal dispute between a Christian laundryman and a Muslim customer plunged the entire village of Dahshour, south of Cairo, into <a href=\"http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/49581/Egypt/Politics-/Clashes-leave-Dahshur-with-no-Christians,-angry-Mu.aspx\" title=\"\">a perilous sectarian conflict</a> culminating in the Copts abandoning their homes and businesses in the village.</p> <p>As one Muslim was killed accidentally in the brawl that followed the altercation with the Christian laundryman, fellow Muslims went on the rampage plundering Christian shops and torching homes.</p> <p>Locals accuse the police of standing by and of failing to act in time, despite warnings of revenge attacks. Human rights groups had also urged the police to be prepared for the worst, but their warnings fell on deaf ears.</p> <p>As has been noted many times before, the practice of \"informal reconciliation\" instead of applying the penal code on what is fundamentally a criminal act, has only made matters worse by sending the wrong signal.</p> <p>The Egyptian leadership's handling of the crisis shows that it has learned little from past mistakes.</p> <p>Instead of rushing to the village to inspect the damage and reassure Christians there, President Mohamed Morsi did more or less what the now jailed former president Hosni Mubarak used to do: he denounced the violence and urged the authorities to punish the culprits. Bizarrely, his office later released a statement saying the presidency had received assurances that the Copts were not forced out of their homes, but simply fled out of fear for their own safety.</p> <p>Given his Islamist ideology, which is often blamed for sectarian attacks on Christians in Egypt and elsewhere in the region, and that he is the country's first democratically elected president, Morsi could have used the Dahshour incident to convince Egypt's sizeable Christian minority (who are justifiably fearful of him) that his brand of Islamism embraces in deeds, and not just in words, the secular values of equal rights to citizens regardless of gender and religion. But he clearly missed that opportunity.</p> <p>The Copts have heard the Islamist mantra far too often \u2013 that Allah has obliged Muslims to protect \"the people of the book\". As Islamists assume power in Egypt, the sectarian violence in Dahshour offered them an opportunity to prove their critics wrong. But Morsi's behaviour has so far failed to reassure his Coptic subjects.</p> <p>Egypt's sectarian malaise runs deeper than many might imagine. Those who think it is confined to rural Egypt and poor communities should abandon that illusion. I was shocked to hear abominable views of Copts among Egypt's affluent and supposedly well-educated Muslims: \"They want to take over the country\", \"They should be kept in their place,\" etc. A Muslim architect once told me: \"Guns are the only language they understand.\" Not to mention, of course, talk of \"monasteries being turned into fortresses and weapons depots\".</p> <p>Such views are hardly surprising given the official attitudes. The authorities never acted against public events or the TV talk shows that denigrate Christianity and present it as <a href=\"http://www.christian-dogma.com/vb/showthread.php?p=2584744\" title=\"\">an inferior religion</a>. The logical conclusion is that they seem to condone what amounts to incitement to hatred of Copts.</p> <p>The Egyptian state has never accepted the obvious: the Copts \u2013 estimated to be 10% of the population \u2013 suffer discrimination. Not only are Copts hard to find in senior government and military and security posts, but their right to worship is seriously undermined. While Muslims can build mosques anywhere they like \u2013 even illegally, and the state never dares to knock them down \u2013 Copts face often-insurmountable bureaucratic hurdles to obtain planning permission, not just for new churches, but even to renovate existing ones.</p> <p>The Copts don't like to describe what happened in Dahshour or elsewhere many times before as \"clashes\". They describe each such sectarian incident as an \"attack\" on them, and rightly so.</p> <p>But they too bear part of the responsibility for their ordeal. The more they take refuge in their own religious institutions the more they walk into the sectarian trap. Relatively few are active in public life. The deeply conservative Coptic church, which has resisted social change as much as its Islamic counterparts, has sought to speak on behalf of Christians \u2013 which tends only to aggravate Egypt's sectarian wounds.</p> <p>Religious solidarity along sectarian lines is part of the problem, and certainly not the solution. While it is understandable that the church has to defend the interests of its followers, the response to the dangers of politicised Islam should not be politicised Christianity.</p> <p>The interests of Copts are best served by defending the separation of religion from politics and not by turning the church into a political platform.</p>",

Nothing else moved on the barren streets of the city's north. Aleppo is now in virtual lockdown ahead of what is expected to be an imminent showdown between loyalist forces and opposition guerillas.</p> <p>Late on Tuesday, the shelling in Salahedine had subsided long enough for casualties to be removed for the first time in 24 hours. Among them was a smiling 24 year old from the town of al-Bab, named Zeitoun, who had been hit by a tank round. He was the 63rd rebel from al-Bab to have died in the siege for Aleppo and its surround in the past fortnight, according to the FSA.</p> <p>\"We know he will not be the last one,\" said one of his colleagues, Abu Nour, as he raced back from Aleppo to bury his friend. \"But we are right and we will prevail. This is a momentum that cannot be stopped.\"</p> <p>The young rebel was lowered into the red earth of a graveyard brimming with white tombstones just before the end of another day of Ramadan fasting.</p> <p>\"Of course we are sad for his family,\" said Aheikh Omar, the dead rebel's spiritual leader. \"But we are also happy for his family that they raised a man like this.

  "<p>Wade Michael Page's neighbours are largely of one view about the man who shot dead six worshipers at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin on Sunday.</p> <p>\"I stayed away from him,\" said Char Brown, who lived in the same building and said she endured him playing loud rock music late into the night.</p> <p>Another neighbour, Jennifer Dunn, a psychiatric nurse, said she regarded Page as \"creepy\" in part because he would not look her in the eye. Dunn too complained about the music and said that the night before the attack on the Sikh temple it seemed particularly loud.</p> <p>FBI investigators will be looking into what it was Page was listening to in the hours before the massacre and whether it shaped his state of mind given he played in two white power bands that performed with lyrics urging racial domination.</p> <p>The bands \u2013 Definite Hate and End Apathy \u2013 came to be an important part of Page's life after a failed army career, dismissal from a series of jobs and a rocky relationship with a girlfriend who left him earlier this year.</p> <p>Char Brown's husband, David, called Page \"very standoffish\" and \"not real friendly\". He said he rarely saw Page emerge from his flat other than to go out with an instrument case on his back.</p> <p>But Page's stepmother, Laura Page, said it wasn't always that way. She described him as a \"normal little boy\" and struggled to explain how he came to be a mass murderer with a Facebook picture of him in front of a Nazi swastika.<br>Laura Page said that joining the military had appeared to be good for her stepson because it \"gave him focus\".</p> <p>\"Now I greatly question that direction. I don't know if the military was good for him. I don't know. I wish I had some answers. And we're not going to have answers because he's dead,\" she said.</p> <p>Page did well enough after joining in 1992 to be assigned to a psychological operations unit at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The unit is regarded in the US military as exclusive.</p> <p>But at the time Fort Bragg was also a recruiting centre for white hate groups including the <a href=\"http://www.natvan.com/\">National Alliance</a>, once regarded as one of the most effective such groups and also among the most extreme because it openly glorified Adolf Hitler. The Military Law Review at the time reported that National Alliance flags were openly hung in barracks and, out of uniform, soldiers sported neo-Nazi symbols and played records about killing blacks and Jews.</p> <p>\"White supremacists have a natural attraction to the army,\" the Military Law Review said. \"They often see themselves as warriors, superbly fit and well-trained in survivalist techniques and weapons and poised for the ultimate conflict with various races.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394361699\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/7/1344358074826/Wisconsin-Sikh-community--008.jpg\" alt=\"Wisconsin Sikh community vigil\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wisconsin governor Scott Walker at a candle light vigil at the Sikh Religious Society of Wisconsin on Monday.

Soldiers were also arrested as members of skinhead gangs involved in assaults.</p> <p>Chris Robillard described Page as his \"closest friend\" in the military. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/06/us/wisconsin-shooting-suspect/index.html\">He told CNN that Page was</a> \"a very kind, very smart individual\" but even then had taken up the white supremacist cudgel.</p> <p>\"He would often mention the racial holy war that was coming,\" he said. \"We just looked at it like he was trying to get attention to himself because he was always the vulnerable type of person. Even in a group of people he would be off alone.\"</p> <p>Another former colleague in the psychological operations unit, Fred Allen Lucas, said that Page called him a \"race traitor\" for dating Latina women and took to calling other races \"dirt people\".</p> <p>\"It didn't matter if they were black, Indian, Native American, Latin \u2013 he hated them all,\" Lucas told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.</p> <p>He said that among Page's tattoos was one that repeated a mantra popular among white supremacists: we must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children. Because the sentence has 14 words, some white supremacists wear tattoos and clothing with the number as a code. Page had the number 14 tattooed on his left shoulder.</p> <p>By the time Page's contract with the army was complete in 1998 he had a poor enough record, marred by drunkenness and failing to report for duty, that the military did not permit him to re-enlist. He had already been demoted from sergeant.</p> <p>After the army, Page drifted between jobs, including a motorbike parts dealership before he was sacked in part because he did not like taking orders from a woman, and then as a lorry driver. But mostly he focussed on playing in white power bands.</p> <p>Sometimes he performed with a Nazi swastika hanging behind the drummer. His first band, Definite Hate, produced an album called Violent Victory with a cover design of a white fist punching a black man in the face.</p> <p>The fist is tattooed with the letters HFFH for \"Hammerskins Forever, Forever Hammerskins\" after a national skinhead organisation.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://wst.siteintelgroup.com/\">Site Monitoring Service</a>, which tracks white supremacist groups, said Page appeared regularly on various white power websites including Stormfront and Hammerskin. He signed off on at least one occasion with \"88\", used by Nazi sympathisers to mean \"Heil Hitler\" because H is the eighth letter of the alphabet.</p> <p>Definite Hate's songs included lines such as: \"Wake up, white man, for your race, and your land\".</p> <p>Page told <a href=\"http://www.label56.com/\">Label 56</a>, a record company that distributed his band's albums and sold Definite Hate T-shirts, that he founded his second group, End Apathy, to wake people up.</p> <p>\"A lot of what I realised at the time was that if we could figure out how to end people's apathetic ways it would be the start toward moving forward,\" Page is quoted as saying. \"Of course after that it requires discipline, strict discipline, to stay the course in our sick society.\"</p> <p>After the Oak Creek shooting, Label 56 issued a statement distancing itself from Page.</p> <p>\"We have never sought attention by using \"shock value\" symbols and ideology that are generally labeled as such. With that being said, all images and products related to End Apathy have been removed from our site. We do not wish to profit from this tragedy financially or with publicity,\" it said. \"In closing please do not take what Wade [Page] did as honorable or respectable and please do not think we are all like that.\"</p> <p>But the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist groups, lists Label 56 as a \"hate site\" because of its promotion of racist bands such as Children of the Reich and Stormtroop 16.</p> <p>While the local police and FBI said that Page was not on their radar because he had not committed any crimes, <a href=\"http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/news/alleged-sikh-temple-shooter-former-member-of-skinhead-band\">he came to the attention of the Southern Poverty Law Center</a> a decade ago. It describes Page as a \"frustrated neo-Nazi\".</p>",
  "<p>Indian relatives of the victims of the Wisconsin Sikh temple shooting have called on US authorities to release the bodies of the victims, as more details emerge of the dead and wounded.</p> <p>Most of those killed by Wade Michael Page, a 41-year-old army veteran, were Indian nationals; some were religious workers who had travelled from India, where the Sikh religion was founded in the 15th century.</p> <p>Investigators have said they are still trying to work out what motivated Page to carry out his attack on Sunday.</p> <p>Dr Harcharan Gill, a veterinarian and trustee of the Oak Tree temple, said the Wisconsin community was expecting families of the two injured victims, Punjab Singh and Santokh Singh, to arrive from Delhi on Tuesday.</p> <p>Gill, whose brother-in-law Satwant Singh Kaleka was among those killed, said Punjab Singh was seriously ill. \"Punjab Singh is very critical and has gone into a coma after undergoing surgery for his bullet wounds. He had arrived here just a few days ago,\" Gill said.</p> <p>He said Santokh Singh had been in the US for about three or four years, and was in the process of applying for a green card, so that his family could join him. He had traveled to India last month to visit his family in West Delhi.</p> <p>One woman, Parmjit Kaur Toor, 41, died on Sunday. The four men killed were Seeta Singh, 41; Parkash Singh, 49; Ranjit Singh, 39; and Subegh Singh, 84.</p> <p>The traveling religious workers who died, or were injured, would visit immigrant Sikh communities in America to help with duties such as reciting of the scriptures at the gurdwaras, and perform rituals in other community events like marriages. \"A morning prayer at the temple had got over at 10.20am, and just as these workers were coming out on a break, they found themselves in the face of Wade's gun attack\", said Gill.</p> <p>Two of those killed, Seeta Singh, 41, and Ranjit Singh, 39, were brothers. Gill said: \"Ranjit Singh had been here for many years, but his brother joined him recently, about four to five months ago.\" They are survived by their wives and children, who live in Delhi.</p> <p>The former president of the body that manages Delhi's gurdwaras, Harwinder Singh Sarna, who visited both bereaved families in Delhi on Tuesday, told the Guardian that they were struggling to make sense of Sunday's killings. He added an appeal for American authorities: \"We would request them to release the bodies of Ranjit Singh or Seeta Singh. If that is not possible, they should issue visas on an urgent basis for their families so that they can travel to the US and perform the last rites.\"</p> <p>Sarna said his organisation had announced financial assistance for the families, including a fund to meet the educational expenses of the children whose fathers died. The body also wishes to donate $5,000 to lieutenant Brian Murphy, the police officer who was seriously injured in the attack. Despite his injuries, Murphy tried to wave off assistance from other officers and directed them into the temple instead.</p> <p>\"We are very grateful to him for his courage and we will be very happy if he would accept this,\" Sarna said.</p> <p>Wade's oldest victim was Subegh Singh Khattra, 84, a wheat farmer from Punjab who emigrated to Wisconsin in 2004 to live with his son, Baljinder Singh Khattra.</p> <p>Baljinder, a taxi driver, who moved to America as a young immigrant in the mid-1990s, said he asked his aging parents to come and live with him so that he could take greater care of them. \"My father would go off to the gurdwara early every morning. He was devout, but that was also a place where he could meet other elderly members of the community, and escape being lonely and bored at home.\" Baljinder said he was yet to see his father's body. </p> <p>Baljinder's wife, Kulwant Kaur, who was at the temple during Sunday morning's attack, saw her father-in-law lying in the hallway, bleeding from a wound in his head, as she was being rescued by security officials responding to the attack.</p> <p>Baljinder said he was moved by the fact that all his neighbours, across various backgrounds, had reached out to his family since the tragedy, and offered solace. \"It was just one individual who lost his head that morning and committed this senseless killings. May God give his soul peace,\" he said.</p> <p>Wade's mother, Laura Lynn, has said she was devastated by her son's actions and that she apologised to the victims and the families. She told <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2184602/Wisconsin-temple-shooting-Devastated-mother-Sikh-temple-killer-Wade-Michael-Page-apologizes-sons-victims.html\">Mail Online</a>: \"He was such a precious little boy, that's all I can say. We was a very fun-loving, typical little boy. He was just a very soft spoken, gentle young man.\"</p> <p>Lynn said she had not been in contact with him in the 12 years since she and his father divorced.</p> <p>Investigators have said they are still ascertaining what exactly pushed Wade to open fire. The Southern Poverty Law Center said in a statement that Wade Michael Page was a member of two racist skinhead bands \u2013 End Apathy and Definite Hate, the latter a band whose album Violent Victory featured a drawing of a disembodied white arm punching a black man in the face.</p> <p>The fist is tattooed with the letters \"HFFH,\" the acronym for the phrase \"Hammerskins Forever, Forever Hammerskins.\" The Hammerskins is a nationwide skinhead organization with regional factions and chapters that once dominated the racist skinhead movement in the United States, the SPLC said.</p> <p>The killings have revived the debate over America's troubled relationship with guns, and now foreign nationals are weighing in, too. When US ambassador Nancy Powell visited one of Delhi's leading Sikh temples, the Gurudwara Bangla Sahib, on Monday, members gave her a written statement that dealt with gun control as well as prejudice against Sikhs living in the US.</p> <p>Sarna, who met Powell, said: \"Powell assured us that the US government would do its best to prevent such incidents from happening again in the future. But we are concerned about the gun culture and would ask the American authorities to try to curb this in their country. Innocent lives were lost in Colorado too because of this.\"</p> <p>Responding to a tweet, India's ambassador in Washington, Nirupama Rao, said on Twitter on Monday evening: \"u can't expect me to lead charge on gun control as a foreigner here. Although, it has to come from American citizens, and them alone.\"</p>",

  "<p>Authors are asking a New York judge to order Google to pay them $750 (\u00a3479) for every book the search giant scanned without authorisation as part of its controversial Google Books programme.</p> <p>The litigation has been running since 2005, when Google began to digitise millions of books without permission from authors to<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2005/sep/22/books.booksnews\" title=\"\"> huge protests</a>. A proposed $125m (\u00a379) settlement <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/23/google-online-library-plans-thwarted\" title=\"\">was rejected last year</a> when judge Denny Chin ruled that Google's plans had gone \"too far\", and now the legal wrangling is kicking off again.</p> <p>A motion for<a href=\"http://thepublicindex.org/docs/cases/authorsguild/1049-ag-sj-motion.pdf\" title=\"\"> summary judgment</a> filed in late July, and made public at the end of last week, shows US writers body The Authors Guild asking the court to rule that Google's \"unauthorised reproduction, distribution, and display of in-copyright books are not 'fair uses'\" under copyright law.</p> <p>The guild, led by the bestselling author Scott Turow, also states that writers are entitled to statutory damages of $750 for each book Google has copied, distributed or displayed in violation of copyright law. With at least 12m books scanned by Google, the majority of which are believed to be protected by copyright <a href=\"http://blog.authorsguild.org/2012/06/01/scott-turow-on-google-ruling-one-big-step-closer-to-justice-for-us-authors/\" title=\"\">according to the Authors Guild</a>, the claim lays the search giant open to potentially having to pay out hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.</p> <p>The named plaintiffs in the motion are authors Betty Miles, Joseph Goulden and Jim Bouton, the former New York Yankees baseball pitcher. Earlier this summer <a href=\"http://thepublicindex.org/docs/cases/authorsguild/2012-05-31-opinion.pdf\" title=\"\">Chin granted the Authors Guild the right to move forward with a class action lawsuit against Google</a>, saying that \"given the sweeping and undiscriminating nature of Google's unauthorised copying, it would be unjust to require that each affected association member litigate his claim individually\", and that class action was \"without question, more efficient and effective than requiring thousands of authors to sue individually\". Turow, author of the legal thriller Innocent, said Chin's decision meant \"we're one big step closer to justice being done for US authors\".</p> <p>Chin will hear summary judgment motions on the case next month. Google believes it \"passes with ease\" the test of fair use, because the service provides \"enormous transformative benefit\" to the public without \"reducing the value\" of any authors' work. \"Google Books is an important advance on the card-catalogue method of finding books,\" <a href=\"http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/copyright/article/53341-google-says-book-search-is-fair-use.html\" title=\"\">its brief argues</a>. \"Readers benefit by being able to find relevant books. Authors benefit because their books can be more readily found, purchased, and read. The public benefits from the increase of knowledge that results.\"</p> <p>Authors, however, <a href=\"http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/copyright/article/53444-damages-could-exceed-1-billion-in-authors-guild-case-against-google.html\" title=\"\">say that Google's \"unauthorised uses fall far outside the parameters of section 107's fair use doctrine\"</a>, and that they \"are for a commercial purpose; involve verbatim copying, distribution and display of protected expression; are not transformative, and if they become widespread would adversely affect actual and potential markets for copyrighted books.\"</p>",
  "<p>When the International Olympic Committee president, Jacques Rogge, declared at the opening ceremony that London 2012 was \"<a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/2012olympics/2012-07/28/content_15626066.htm\" title=\"\">a major boost for gender equality</a>\", perhaps he had not heard that on their flights to London the Japanese women's football team and the Australian women's basketball team were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/19/london-2012-japan-australia-sexism\" title=\"\">relegated to economy class, while the men flew business</a>.</p> <p>Still, hopes that this Olympics may yet live up to its billing as the \"equality games\" have been boosted as the Japanese Football Association (JFA) suggested its women footballers may get an upgrade on the way home, while Basketball Australia promised a review of Olympic travel policy.</p> <p>The JFA's treatment of its female team prompted outrage, in less than 24 hours more than 17,000 signed an online petition on the campaign website <a href=\"http://www.change.org/petitions/jfa-provide-equal-treatment-to-the-japanese-women-s-and-men-s-soccer-teams-on-their-flight-back-home-from-the-olympics-nadeshiko-london2012#\" title=\"\">Change.org</a> to push the JFA to change their minds. Or maybe they just stuck to a promise: after the row exploded the chairman stated that a business-class flight for the women \"would be considered for the women's team if they bring a medal home\".</p> <p>On Monday, the <em>Nadeshiko</em>, as they are known, won <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012-football\" title=\"\">2-1 against France</a> in the women's football semi-final, assuring themselves a place in the final on Thursday and at least a silver medal.</p> <p>Coach Norio Sasaki said the women may now fly business class back to Tokyo. \"The Japan Football Association is trying to work something out,\" Sasaki told Kyodo News. \"When we came here we came in premium economy and there wasn't a problem,\" he said.</p> <p>But critics will continue to question why the more successful women's team \u2013 they won the World Cup in Germany last year, bringing joy to a country still reeling from the tsumani which killed 20,000 people \u2013 were given places in economy while the men's squad relaxed in business class on the same plane. Asked about the situation at the time Homare Sawa, the star of Japan's women's football team and Fifa's 2011 world player of the year, told journalists: \"I guess it should have been the other way around. Even just in terms of age, we are senior.\"</p> <p>And the upgrade does not even appear to be in the bag. \"The problem is when we go back there will probably not be enough business seats available. If that's the case we will be in premium again,\" said Sasaki. \"If you look at the way we played then you will see that we are very patient and would put up with economy.\"</p> <p>The Japanese women, nicknamed <em>Nadeshiko</em> after a pink flower that symbolises femininity and grace in Japan, have shown no mercy in their quest to win gold. They beat Brazil 2-0 in the quarter-finals.</p> <p>The less successful men's team also reached the semi-finals, for the first time in 44 years, beating Egypt 3-0. They will now face Mexico on Tuesday.</p> <p>Sohko Fujimoto, 28, co-organiser of the petition on Change.org said the debate was an opportunity for the JFA to prove its commitment to women's sport in Japan. \"Whatever happens we'll be cheering on <em>Nadeshiko</em> on Thursday,\" she said.</p> <p>\"If the JFA lends an ear to the thousands of fans around the world who have backed our campaign, that would be a great result, and starting point, for women's soccer in both Japan and around the globe.\"</p> <p>There is also movement from <a href=\"http://www.basketball.net.au/index.php?id=284\" title=\"\">Basketball Australia</a> which was criticised for flying the male squad, known as the Boomers, in business class while the female squad, the Opals, flew economy. The Australian women have taken silver at the last three Games. The men have never won a medal.</p> <p>In a statement, Basketball Australia's acting CEO, Scott Derwin, <a href=\"http://www.rte.ie/sport/olympics/basketball/2012/0720/329920-aussie-basketball-to-review-travel-discrimination/\" title=\"\">promised a review </a>of the travelling arrangements, which were a \"longstanding policy\", with each team given a budget, over which they had control. He said that, historically, the Opals had been given more funding.</p> <p>However, he recognised that the furore had left the organisation open to claims of sexism. \"The simple fact is when a policy results in gender inequality, it's very clearly not the right policy going forward,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I am putting in place a review of our Olympic travel policy with the goal of ensuring there is equity between travel arrangements for the men's and women's teams attending future Olympics.\"</p> <p>Kristina Keneally, incoming CEO, welcomed the move. \"In this day and age, there's just no excuse for men's and women's sporting teams to be treated differently when they both compete at the same world class level. In fact, in this circumstance, the disparity is even more glaring when you consider that our women's basketball team is one of the best in the world \u2013 enjoying the No 2 spot in international rankings.\"</p>",

At least, that is how Le Pen has chosen to see it. Before the president of the Front National flashes up on screen with a swastika across her forehead, we see various iterations of Madonna \u2013 her little face peering out of a hijab; the top half of her head combined with the Ayatollah's beardy chin; wearing what I think is General Pinochet's hat; definitely a shot of Sarah Palin's eyes in there and, possibly, former president Mobutu's leopard print fedora; finally, Madonna again wearing a Hitler moustache, while, in the background, she sings, \"It's no good when you're misunderstood.\"</p> <p>I think this is called irony, but who knows. As commentary, it has the same political content as a game of Guess Who? (Deluxe Dictators Edition).</p> <p>The singer did have a chance to be political last year with the release of WE, her biopic of lovable old Nazi sympathizers Wallace Simpson and Edward VIII. Madge vigorously countered claims she was glamorising their dubious politics by insisting she had looked into it thoroughly and determined that they did nothing improper \u2013 an assertion she underlines in the movie by having a character point out that although the pair were wined and dined by Hitler, it was in 1937, before he had done anything <em>too</em> naughty. (The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Laws\">Nuremberg laws</a>, prohibiting Jews from enjoying German citizenship, were introduced in 1935, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_concentration_camps#Pre-war_camps\">concentration camps for political prisoners had been opening since 1933</a>, but why be a bore about it?)</p> <p>The sad thing is, Madge doesn't need to do anything particular to be political. She is at her most political when she does nothing at all. Like Gaga, the very fact of her \u2013 her continued success in a marketplace where most female pop stars look like the Pussycat Dolls \u2013 is all the argument she needs. If only she'd leave it at that.</p>",
  "<p>China is braced for its highest profile trial in more than three decades when Gu Kailai, the wife of disgraced politician Bo Xilai, enters the dock to face charges of murdering British businessman Neil Heywood.</p> <p>The last case to attract such global attention was the show trial of Mao Zedong's wife Jiang Qing, following the Cultural Revolution.</p> <p>Then, as now, there is little doubt about the outcome: a guilty verdict. But the differences are more striking than the parallels. Jiang's trial was long, avowedly political and was broadcast on television. Gu's trial, which is due to begin on Thursday, is likely to last a day or less and authorities are keen to portray it as a standard criminal trial, dissociating the party from the lurid scandal as it prepares for a once-a-decade transfer of leadership this autumn.</p> <p>The decision to hold it in Anhui province \u2013 far from the capital and from south-western Chongqing, scene of the alleged murder \u2013 underscores Beijing's keenness to reduce the glare of publicity.</p> <p>\"It is almost the opposite of a show trial: it's a trial of procedure, to tick certain boxes and show there is the rule of law in China,\" said Professor Rana Mitter, an expert on modern Chinese history and politics at the University of Oxford.</p> <p>\"It is an attempt to get this out of the way ... The flipside is the acute worry that if there is too much investigation and exposure of the background of what went on in court, other powerful leaders might in some way be pulled in.\"</p> <p>At the heart of the storm is the untimely death of a 41-year-old man, who left a wife and two young children. Gu, 53, and family employee Zhang Xiaojun, 33, are accused of killing Heywood following a conflict over unspecified economic interests. Xinhua said she had feared for the safety of her son, Bo Guagua. The state-run Global Times newspaper earlier acknowledged that the case was \"quite complicated\" but insisted it would be fair.</p> <p>The overwhelming majority of Chinese trials end in conviction and Xinhua has already said that the evidence against the defendants is \"irrefutable and substantial\". Heywood's mother Ann told the Los Angeles Times this week: \"There are no human rights in China, of which I'm totally aware.\"</p> <p>Hong Kong's South China Morning Post said an unnamed member of the prosecution team had told it that Gu had confessed to murder and economic crimes. \"Gu told investigators everything she could remember and, as for those accusations about which she couldn't remember clearly, she asked the investigators to go ahead and write up anything they'd like to,\" the source said.</p> <p>Pu Zhiqiang, a well-known human rights lawyer, said: \"We hope [the trial] is fair. This case has been influenced by political factors, such as in the choice of court and lawyers. Gu's family could not choose the lawyer for her; the lawyer was assigned to Gu.\"</p> <p>Li Xiaolin, a well-known Beijing lawyer hired by co-defendant Zhang's family, was also rejected. He said officials in Anhui told him that Zhang had accepted a government-appointed lawyer. Li said he planned to travel to Hefei anyway and hoped to attend the trial. He said his understanding was that Zhang, who has a wife and young child, had not known Heywood personally. \"From this point, he did not have a motive to kill him, so he should not be the principal offender,\" he added.</p> <p>The defence lawyers appear to have been appointed only recently and meetings with their clients would have been relatively short and monitored. Jerome Cohen, an expert on Chinese law, has pointed out <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/china/rough-justice-awaits-gu-kailai/p28776\" title=\"\"> that they are unlikely to see prosecution evidence before the trial or to be able to cross-examine witnesses</a>, since statements are usually read into the record rather than evidence being given in person.</p> <p>Rights lawyer Mo Shaoping said that unless lawyers request an extension, the verdict and sentence are due within a month and a half of the indictment \u2013 announced on 26 July, but apparently issued earlier.</p> <p>The defendants will be allowed to have relatives in court and, unusually, two British diplomats have been given permission to attend in a consular capacity. Foreign media have already been told they have no hope of access.</p> <p>An employee at the Hefei intermediate people's court said no places were available due to limited seating. \"We will release the results to the public punctually,\" she added.</p> <p>If convicted as expected, Gu and Zhang face punishment ranging from a lengthy prison term to the death penalty. Gu, a former lawyer, once compared the Chinese system favourably to the protracted legal processes in the US, writing: \"As long as it is known that you, John Doe, killed someone, you will be arrested, tried and shot to death.\"</p> <p>Many suspect that her family connections may have paved the way for a lesser punishment \u2013 most likely a suspended death sentence \u2013 due to diminished responsibility, or because a confession or the claim she saw Heywood as a threat to her son may be taken in mitigation. She is the daughter of a well-known revolutionary and her husband's high profile presents authorities with a dilemma.</p> <p>Too severe a punishment may be seen as political retaliation against the family of a charismatic, popular former leader. Too lenient a penalty may be read as proof that the powerful can escape responsibility for their deeds. The defendants will have the right to appeal, but seem unlikely to do so.</p> <p>\"Since the sentence will be determined politically, amongst Beijing's highest leaders, it will not be subject to change,\" noted Cohen.</p>",
  "<p>A lifetime of exhaustive training, blood, sweat and tears, learning from highs and lows, relationship sacrifices and time away from the ones you love most while you travel the world seeking competition all go into one Olympic Games. Then you get your one chance \u2013 one shot at putting all of this dedication together, to create an achievement you would be proud of. The gun goes and you're off and racing, using the skills you have honed to give you the best start, using the biomechanics you spend hours and hours researching to execute the perfect physical technique, and using the guts, drive and determination to push you through the final 10m of the race when pain is searing through every inch of your body.</p> <p>You cross the line, touch the wall or stick the landing to the best standard you could ever imagine. You turn around, check the scoreboard, and that lifetime of work is condensed down into a bright shining No2. Wow, you think, I've just won a silver medal at the Olympic Games, all of my work has paid off! You receive your medal, it's heavy, it's real, and it's yours, forever! A victory lap is completed where yes, most of the attention is paid to the gold medallist, but they wouldn't be there without you. Still buzzing, you make your way through the mixed zone of media to what you expect to be more praise and excitement. Then, you're stopped dead in your tracks \u2026</p> <p>\"How does it feel to have lost the gold medal?\" \"How does it feel to be so close, but yet so far?\" And the most gut-wrenching question of all: \"You must be disappointed?\"</p> <p>Your head does a spin. Here you are, soaking up the most magnificent performance of your career, a career that you chose to do purely for the love of sport, and someone is telling you that you should be disappointed?</p> <p>They call it winning a silver medal, because that is exactly what it is: winning. They only give out three medals per event. You have one day to bring your A-game, put your career on the line, and execute the best performance you can to grab one of those medals. That is why claiming a silver or a bronze medal takes winning.</p> <p>Now, I can comment only on what I have been able to observe from down here in Australia but I am sick and tired of athletes being almost forced into disappointment at not winning gold. All of the headlines are the same: \"Seebohm falls short\" (silver medal in the women's 100m backstroke), \"Ginn faces defeat\" (silver medal in the men's four rowing), \"Magnussen sinks\" (silver medal in the men's 100m freestyle).</p> <p>Australia, as of now, sit 19th on the medal table with two gold, 12 silver and eight bronze medals. I will admit, based on our past Olympic performances, this is a low standing. But let's look into why this may be: John Coates, the president of the Australian Olympic Committee, blames the athletes' failure (there's that terrible word again) on a decline in government funding along with decreased participation in compulsory school sport. Kevin Gosper, as Australia's most senior member of the IOC, supports this, and adds that our coaches need to be paid more so they can dedicate themselves solely to athlete performance.</p> <p>Even our coaches aren't free from criticism, with one headline on Tuesday reading: \"Aussie coaches win gold! (for another country)\". Australian coaches are offered big money to take on international athletes. They can't refuse an increase in money when it means they will also be able to provide for their national athletes better. Australia put on one of the best Olympic Games the world has ever seen only 12 years ago, and was a sporting world super power \u2013 can Great Britain expect to be in our position come 2024? Here's hoping not.</p> <p>The reason athletes themselves feel disappointed with a silver medal is the enormous amount of pressure placed on them to perform. This pressure comes from many places but, mostly, it comes from within; they just don't want to let anyone down. In the lead-up to an Olympic Games, so much media hype swirls around anyone who is even within a whisper of a gold medal. By the time that athlete gets to race day the expectations of the country are on their shoulders; if they fall short the entire country will be in shock.</p> <p>Also swirling around in the athlete's head are the sacrifices their family has made to get them to this point. With the minimal funding that is received by all amateur sports across Australia, and the world, it is rare for athletes to find themselves in a position where they can dedicate all of their time to their sport. Most hold down a job in between the six hours of training they complete each day.</p> <p>More often than not, it is your family which pays for your trips away, helps you with training fees and pays for physio and massage appointments to keep your body functioning. They pay for any competition equipment you may need to put you on par with anyone else in the world, they even cook meals for you when you know that the time and money you have just won't be enough to provide yourself with adequate nutrition.</p> <p>Your family will always be proud, and no matter the colour of the medal, or the placing beyond that, they will hold you close and congratulate you with the best form of words they can get out without crying with joy! But you want to win the gold for them, as much as you do for yourself \u2013 and when you get silver, you do have momentary feelings of disappointment at letting your family down, even though you know you never could.</p> <p>An increase in funding would allow an athlete to train, rest, and train again, without having to worry about how they are going to pay the next bill. They could exclude the pressures of performing for others, and just perform for themselves, hence bringing back the winning part of a silver medal.</p> <p>So to all of this I say, let's rally together and increase funding for athletes, worldwide, so they can do what they have always dreamt to do. Let's congratulate their families for every single moment of their lives that have been dedicated towards their children's success \u2026 and let's raise our glasses to every single silver and bronze medallist at this Olympics, as well as at previous and future Games.</p> <p>You have done yourselves proud, you have done your families proud and you always do your countries proud, simply by wearing your team tracksuit. Congratulations, you won!</p>",
  "<p>When Alistair Brownlee <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/07/alistair-brownlee-olympic-triathlon-jonny\" title=\"\">won gold in the triathlon</a> earlier today, trumping his younger brother Jonny who received the bronze, he showed elation, relief, and sheer pride. Absent was any expression of the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/triathlon/9457292/London-2012-Olympics-Brownlee-brothers-get-down-to-family-affair-in-triathlon-as-they-prepare-for-capital-Games.html\" title=\"\">earlier declaration</a> that an ideal finish would involve the brothers finishing at the same instant, both winners, both best, yet neither ousting the other. Is this an example of public support but private competition between siblings? Does this suggest that the greatest rivalries are home-grown? Or might we benefit from listening to the disparate expressions \u2013 both what the brothers' said and how they behaved \u2013 and consider how these are incorporated into the mix of feelings we have towards siblings.</p> <p>We are easily intrigued by the enactment of sibling rivalry on the public stage. Made larger than life by talent and ambition, sibling pairs such as the Miliband brothers, the Williams sisters and now the Brownlees arouse our interest. Watching siblings compete for a prize that simply cannot be divided into equal parts (a ploy so many parents use, in spite of the fact that a child's notion of \"fair share\" is rarely an equal piece) resonates with issues many of us dealt with in childhood, and which can linger throughout our lives. However much we love a sibling, his or her sudden success may make us uneasy; and however much we love a sibling, his or her disappointment may inject a moment of thrilling relief. These feelings do not arise from nastiness, but from the power of mixed feelings that arise from our earliest experiences of having a companion, ally and comforter who also competes with us for the attention and care we need to survive.</p> <p>In the rough and tumble of life, we learn to jostle for our place in the family pecking order and to mark out a highly individual niche. It is common for siblings to differentiate themselves from one another in order to avoid starkly exposed comparisons. For example, a common cognitive manoeuvre against that unsettling sense of being inferior to a sibling is: \"She is highly paid and high profile, but my work offers pleasure to more people,\" or, \"He's a brilliant cellist, but I'm a better son.\" More rationally, we develop our own interests, our own talents, or own set of friends, and stand behind a somewhat different set of standards. Such differences protect us from the endless, exhausting comparisons that shadowed our childhood.</p> <p>So when we see siblings who have no contrasting goals (as far as we can see) to soften the starkness of competition and comparison, we are thrilled by the theatre in which old issues are re-enacted. What is it like still harbouring the brutally direct competition when you are a grown-up? Does the victor destroy the loser? Does the competition kill the good that might otherwise thrive in the relationship?</p> <p>Not necessarily. And that's why the Brownlee brothers' vision where they both enter an event in which one gold medal will be awarded, and one wins but neither loses to the other is a wonderful emotional puzzle. It is a way of accepting that each of them is highly competitive, but denying that they compete against one another.</p> <p>The reality of course was very different. The older brother did what older brothers so often do: he pulled out all the stops to race ahead, used his ability to exert sharp bursts of speed to exhaust the others, and when he looked back, it was not to check whether his little brother Jonny was OK; it was to check that he was in front.</p> <p>A choreographed double \"win\" is a sweet idea. However, more impressive, psychologically speaking, is how siblings can compete with one another and leave their bond intact. In 2007 when Venus and Serena Williams were competing against one another at the semi-finals of the US Open (in fact they have competed against one another eight times in a Grand Slam final) Venus said that a perk of playing Serena was that each was reassured the winner would be a Williams.</p> <p>The Brownlees are not alone in having a fraternal relationship with one of their competitors. Usain Bolt ran against his long-term training partner Yohan Blake. While he had no problem in unrestrained crowing after his victory in the 100m, he did not neglect brotherly feelings. In essence his message was, \"I'm the best today, but Yohan works hard and is talented.\" Bolt was happy to allow for the possibility that one day Blake would grab the gold.</p> <p>Sibling bonds run deep. Some people look to the animal world for the power of sibling rivalry \u2013 and there is plenty there, particularly among avian species where larger chicks can battle and starve a smaller one \u2013 but other species also express protectiveness, caring for siblings, feeding them, even risking their lives. After all, the psychology we have that may be shaped by our selfish genes, makes it likely that we want a sibling (who shares roughly half of our own genes) to thrive. And so it is not surprising to hear Alistair's response: \"To get two of us, two brothers, two British brothers on the podium is absolutely \u2026 you couldn't ask for any more.\"</p>",

At its first half results, it demonstrated what we liked about the shares: increasing non-TV advertising revenues, cost control, a very strong balance sheet and a strong position within the TV advertising market. <br> Up to now, the market's chief question is whether ITV returns cash at its full year results in March. We think a more important point is that ITV is likely to become a regular returner of cash: it is net cash positive, highly cash generative and unlikely to make big acquisitions.  [We] estimate it could return \u00a31.3bn (40% of market cap) over four years while maintaining a conservative net debt/earnings figure, while remaining a story where we believe consensus estimates are very much behind the curve. </blockquote> <p>ITV ended 1.5p better at 81.15p. Another company where the main topic of discussion was a share buyback was <strong>InterContinental Hotels</strong>. The group added 103p to \u00a317.25 as it announced plans to return $1bn to shareholders, funded by the expected proceeds of the sale of the New York Barclay hotel. It also said the InterContinental Park Lane in London was likely to be the next of its trophy assets to go on the block.</p> <p>Overall the market continued its recent rise into the third day, with the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finishing 32.47 points higher at 5841.24. The outcome would have been even better if not for <strong>Standard Chartered</strong>. The bank slumped 241.5p to 1228.5p - although it came off its worst levels - in the wake of accusations from New York of illegal transactions involving Iran. Its decline knocked nearly 19 points off the leading index.</p> <p>Mining groups were among the main risers, with <strong>Xstrata</strong> adding 13.9p to 896.9p after better than expected figures. <strong>Anglo American</strong> finished up 82p to \u00a320.08 while <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> climbed 23.8p to 426.9p. A rising oil price lifted <strong>BP</strong> 12.8p to 453.8p and <strong>BG</strong> 41p to \u00a313.24.</p> <p><strong>Legal and General</strong> edged up 0.1p to 131.6p. The insurer reported half year operating profits up 5% to \u00a3518m and an 18% hike in the dividend. But it warned:</p> <blockquote> We expect the industry will continue to face challenging economic headwinds and continue to plan accordingly. The UK economy is likely to perform poorly and we expect further macro shocks across the world, particularly in the eurozone. <br> We remain confident that in spite of economic conditions we will continue to grow. </blockquote> <p>Kevin Ryan at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> The big surprise with these results was the 18% increase in the interim dividend which reflects management's continued confidence in the business. We continue to see Legal &amp; General as strategically challenged, with just 12% of operating profit coming from outside the UK. However, on the positive side, we view the quality of the cash number the company declares as improving. <br> The recovery from the low of 2008 is complete, we believe, but given the difficult operating environment and the recent run in the shares, we retain our sell as we believe all the good news is more than adequately reflected in the current price. </blockquote> <p>Leading the FTSE 250 was <strong>Heritage Oil</strong>, which finished 25.8p higher at 148.8p. Its shares came back from their recent suspension, after Monday's publication of its half year results and a rights issue prospectus relating to the proposed purchase of a major stake in Nigeria's OML 30.</p> <p>Finally, <strong>Sareum</strong> soared 0.95p to 1.575p after the cancer drug discovery business said it was in advanced talks with a potential licensing partner.</p> <p>Traders were betting this would have an impact on one time collaborator <strong>Physiomics</strong>, up 33% to 0.12p. But the biology company's shares came off their best levels after it issued a statement saying:</p> <blockquote> There are no agreements in existence between Sareum and Physiomics which will have a material impact on the company. </blockquote>",
  "<p>Prosecutors have called for three members of the feminist punk band Pussy Riot to be jailed for three years after arguing they had insulted all of Russian Orthodoxy and posed a danger to society.</p> <p>\"They must be isolated from society,\" the federal prosecutor Alexei Nikiforov told the Moscow court on Tuesday. He and lawyers for the victims argued that if they were not jailed, they would strike again.</p> <p>The three band members \u2013 Maria Alyokhina, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Yekaterina Samutsevich \u2013 have been charged with hooliganism motivated by religious hatred after performing a \"punk prayer\" against President Vladimir Putin in a Moscow cathedral.</p> <p>In their closing arguments, prosecutors argued the women were not carrying out a political act, but acting on deep hatred for Russian Orthodoxy. \"They violated the traditions of our country,\" Nikiforov said.</p> <p>He said the fact that \"no politicians\" were named in the punk band's song proved it was not a political act. The name and chorus of the song Pussy Riot performed was called Virgin Mary, Chase Putin Out.</p> <p>Prosecutors presented the women as dangerous feminists.</p> <p>\"All the defendants talked about being feminists and said that is allowed in the Russian Orthodox church,\" said Yelena Pavlova, a lawyer for several of the nine victims who claimed they were insulted by Pussy Riot's performance. \"This does not correspond with reality. Feminism is a mortal sin,\" she said.</p> <p>The Pussy Riot case has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/03/pussy-riot-trial-russia\" title=\"\">reawakened anti-government passions</a> that first emerged when Putin announced last autumn that he was returning to the presidency. Opposition activists have called for an impromptu protest to be held on 19 August.</p> <p>Addressing the court in the afternoon, defence lawyers argued that the women's performance was an act of opposition against Putin and was not motivated by religious hatred. \"The 'prayer' they sang was a political one,\" lawyer Violetta Volkova said.</p> <p>Mark Feygin, another lawyer for the women, gave an impassioned speech warning of the consequences of a conviction, which ended with applause from the journalists witnessing the trial.</p> <p>\"Russia has no rule of law. Russia has no justice system,\" he said. \"Nothing has changed from Soviet times.\"</p> <p>He warned that a guilty verdict would \"definitely tear up relations between society and government\".</p> <p>Society would never forgive the government for jailing three innocent women, he said, warning that tensions, including between society and the church, were building to similar levels as before the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917.</p> <p>He appeared to accept a conviction as a foregone conclusion: \"If the order is handed down from above to jail them, then they will be jailed. This is a political case from beginning to end.\"</p> <p>Pussy Riot have argued that their February performance inside Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Saviour was designed to call attention to the politicisation of the Orthodox church, which was a key agitator for Putin's re-election. Church officials have said their trial has been willed by God.</p> <p>The women have apologised if they offended any Orthodox believers.</p> <p>Prosecutors said on Tuesday that their apologies were insincere and that the victims had \"the right not to be merciful\". They argued that the leader of the church, Patriarch Kirill, had been personally insulted and was \"not just an ordinary citizen\".</p> <p>The three women addressed the court on Tuesday and urged the judge to deliver a not guilty verdict. A verdict is expected in coming days.</p>",

And yet somehow they don't sound like a cross between the former's quirk-pop and the latter's electro-punky soul, probably for good reason \u2013 it would have been a bit of a mess. No, they sound like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/fleetwood-mac\" title=\"\">Fleetwood Mac</a> with a tinge of urban. A bit like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/mar/23/new-band-haim\" title=\"\">Haim</a>? Exactly. Or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/sep/01/new-band-the-pierces\" title=\"\">the Pierces</a> if they'd listened to the-Dream as often as they had <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNavPWHmfI0\" title=\"\">Dreams</a>.</p> <p>Apparently Nordwind and Smith bonded over British indie from the early 80s including <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/smiths\" title=\"\">the Smiths</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/joydivision\" title=\"\">Joy Division</a>, not that you can tell. Their music at its best is MOR with a twist and a dash of dark, with the occasional spurt of new wave energy on some of the tracks where Smith would rather be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/debbie-harry\" title=\"\">Debbie Harry</a> than <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/stevie-nicks\" title=\"\">Stevie Nicks</a>. It also feels accomplished and major label, even if it was originally put together using a less than sophisticated system \u2013 a combination of email and GarageBand. Their debut EP, Human Beings, already out in the States and due for a UK release in September, is neither electronic nor acoustic but contains elements of both, and the songwriting is strong, conventional, with proper structures, verses and choruses and such, and has been well received, one webzine giving it 74 out of 100, which would be a borderline A grade at GCSE, or a 2:1 at university.</p> <p>There's some great stuff on the EP. It starts with That Ain't Right, which sets out PYYRAMIDS' stall with regard to their blend of classic west coast rock with electronic touches and textures, and a chorus that could wow programmers at Radio 2. Literally make them go \"Wow!\" if not the full \"Gosh!\" They peak early, with track two, Don't Go, which has a tribal rhythm and a finger-clicking poppiness without being remotely saccharine \u2013 they give good dynamics and drama, do PYYRAMIDS. Perfect Picture sounds as though it was designed by robots: think <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/blondie\" title=\"\">Blondie</a> if they'd worked with Giorgio Moroder. Actually, Blondie did work with Moroder, on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aH3Q_CZy968\" title=\"\">Call Me</a>, which incidentally was originally meant to be a team-up between the producer and the aforementioned Nicks. Anyway. Perfect Picture is closer to what you'd have expected Call Me to sound like than Call Me itself, which was more rocky than synthy.</p> <p>The EP's title track features a TV spy show theme bassline and is quite new wavey, as is penultimate track Animal, which moves at a fair old sprint and sounds like a Blondie B-side from 1978, with a cutely crude attempt at a snarl from Smith \u2013 who, by the way, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/PYYRAMIDS\" title=\"\">isn't an eight-year-old girl</a> \u2013 on the verses and crudely cute woah-oh-oh harmonies on the chorus. There's a remix of Human Beings by one of Nordwind's OK Go bandmates at the end, but it doesn't tell you much about PYYRAMIDS or their intentions/ambitions. Our ambition is for them to make an R&amp;B <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2011/sep/30/rumours-fleetwood-mac\" title=\"\">Rumours</a>, but we probably said that about Haim, or, for that matter, the Pierces.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Reminds me of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/the-xx\" title=\"\">the xx</a>\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://inyourspeakers.com/content/review/45-pyyramids-human-beings-12062011\" title=\"\">In Your Speakers</a>.</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> They will go their own way.</p> <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Start some rumours.</p> <p><strong>Least likely to:</strong> Tango in the night.</p> <p><strong>What to buy:</strong> The EP Human Beings is released by Paracadute on 17 September.</p> <p><strong>File next to:</strong> Haim, Fleetwood Mac, Pierces, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/904769a8-4494-476c-b4b2-2c146610ec39\" title=\"\">Jezabels</a>.</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Pyyramids\" title=\"\">facebook.com/Pyyramids</a>.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday's new band:</strong> Piff Gang.</p>",
  "<p>The entire 16,000-strong crowd stood to applaud the Chinese women's hockey team, newly defeated by Japan and out of the Olympics, as they made a teary-eyed lap of honour around the pitch.</p> <p>But for at least two of the Chinese nationals in the crowd even this gesture did not overcome what they perceived as an in-built bias against the Olympic medal table-toppers. \"I thought it was a bit disappointing, not very fair,\" said Guo Dongyi, standing with girlfriend Luo Zhoungyue, both from Chengdu in south-west China and studying at Glasgow University. \"They were cheering for Japan all the way through. There was no support for China. I went to the Beijing Games, to watch the basketball. I thought the crowds there were much more friendly, much more welcoming to other teams.\"</p> <p>This, in microcosm, is the dilemma faced by China in the era of its Olympic success, fuelled by a vast and focused national production line of sporting talent, which in turn is a reflection of its increasing world status. Tuesday's dramatic fall by 2004 Olympic champion Liu Xiang, who crashed out of the 110m hurdles in his first race, was a relatively rare loss by a Chinese medal hope.</p> <p>For some Chinese fans and pundits the pleasure of another bumper crop of medals \u2013 33 golds, 20 silvers and 14 bronzes at the time of writing \u2013 has been tempered by what they believe is foreign resentment and jealousy. They see this manifesting itself in speculative claims that the times posted by the teenage swimmer Ye Shiwen must have been achieved through illicit means, in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/01/badminton-body-apologises-players-disqualified\" title=\"\">the disqualification of the Chinese women's doubles badminton top seeds for throwing a group match</a>, even in the demotion of the victorious women's track sprint team to silver for an illegal changeover, despite a similar fate befalling the British duo earlier in the contest.</p> <p>Particularly with regards to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/30/ye-shiwen-world-record-olympics-2012\" title=\"\">Ye Shiwen</a>, this disquiet has been expressed at the highest levels. Such suspicions, said a commentary this week in the People's Daily, the official Communist party paper, indicated \"double standards that have taken aim at the Chinese team and its athlete\".</p> <p>It added: \"This, unfortunately, is hard to explain as inadvertent missteps \u2013 it might be closer to the truth to see it as deliberate attacking and interference.\"</p> <p>An editorial in the Global Times, a state-run populist tabloid, was blunter still: \"Negative comments about her and Chinese athletes come from deep bias and reluctance from the western press to see Chinese people making breakthroughs. It shows that the unfriendliness of the west to China is spreading.\"</p> <p>In truth, whatever the wider tensions of global geo-politics you would have to search hard to locate openly anti-Chinese feeling at the London Games. While the support for home athletes is, inevitably, noisy and partisan, with an associated bias towards nations with British ties, such as New Zealand, Australia and the Caribbean islands, claps and cheers tend to otherwise be distributed fairly equally, with perhaps a tendency of bias towards perceived underdogs.</p> <p>As with all crowds, the later the hour and the more alcohol consumed, the more likelihood of hostility. But even here the enmities tend to be more traditional, such as the isolated and somewhat half-hearted boos in the Saturday night boxing ring when an official was announced as Argentinian.</p> <p>At a spot-check of half a dozen venues around the Olympic Park on Monday, the reception for Chinese athletes announced to the crowd seemed no more or less effusive than for other nations, even when, as with the track cyclist Guo Shuang, they were a threat to a British favourite, in this case, Victoria Pendleton.</p> <p>A more combative atmosphere could be found in the basketball arena, where Britain's men were en route to a surprise victory against a Chinese team. Here, a number of red-and-yellow Chinese banners were hung from the stands, alongside the ubiquitous Union flags. Pro-British chants were met by an equally vocal response from Chinese fans.</p> <p>Sun Jeanyu, a 25-year-old restaurant owner, had the dual perspective of Chinese origin \u2013 and a red shirt proclaiming his allegiance \u2013 along with an upbringing in his home country of France.</p> <p>\"I think in general there's been a real sense of fair play,\" he said of his four-day trip to the Games, which had also taken in diving and gymnastics. \"Yes, there's a lot of shouting, 'GB! GB!' in the arena, but that's normal \u2013 both sets of fans want their team to win.\"</p> <p>Sun contrasted the experience with the events he witnessed at the 2008 Olympics: \"In Beijing it was almost all Chinese crowds. London is such a cosmopolitan city, so there's people from all over the world. I think the Chinese populations from every European city are here at the moment.\"</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the British fans view it differently, many attesting that the 2012 Games are the fairest yet in cheering on competitors from all nations.</p> <p>Sharon Leach, from Woking, Surrey, had watched the China-Japan hockey game with her daughter and son-in-law and had a different take on the crowd to Guo and Luo.</p> <p>\"We knew that if Japan won it would get GB through to the semi-finals, so more of the crowd was cheering them, but I think it was understandable,\" she said. \"The standing ovation for the Chinese team was lovely, though. These are athletes who have tried as hard as they can, so they all deserve our support.\"</p> <p>Leach recounted a Team GB v Poland volleyball game in which the home support was outnumbered: \"It was a sea of red and white flags. It must have been two-thirds Polish. You'd think that might cause a problem but the British fans didn't seem to mind. Maybe it was just that they knew we're not very good at volleyball, so not very likely to win.\"</p> <p>However, Leach and her daughter and son-in-law, Cassie and Benjamin Schifano, were willing to concede reservations about the occasionally regimented system which produces the never-ending stream of Chinese medallists.</p> <p>\"You're cheering the athletes, not the system,\" said Leach. \"With the badminton players who got disqualified at first I was angry with the players, but then I realised they were probably just being told what to do by the coaches.\"</p> <p>Added Cassie: \"I heard [British diver] Tom Daley saying how hard he had to train because his Chinese rivals did nothing else.</p> <p>\"People realise how tough the Chinese system is with the athletes, and how hard they train. That can make it very difficult for other countries. But there's nothing wrong with it \u2013 training really, really hard isn't cheating.\"</p> <p>Few people were looking quite as American as Teddy Schneider, a 23-year-old from New Jersey who was among a group dressed in skin-tight Lycra stars-and-stripes outfits to watch the US women's hockey team \u2013 including his girlfriend \u2013 play South Africa.</p> <p>\"I think it's more healthy competition than anything,\" he said of the US-China medals tussle. \"I never want the Chinese athletes to do badly. You want to beat people at their best, you want a good contest.\"</p> <p>It was time for Schneider to console his newly arrived girlfriend. \"They lost 7-0. No country can be good at everything.\"</p>",

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hPvE58LuyBKVNafqrT3cZzQXv97w?docId=CNG.386652d9a0613864ad9f110c6b41963f.231\" title=\"\">visit of the Iranian president</a>, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to Saudi Arabia comes at a crucial time for the conflict in Syria. Few observers can be optimistic about the chances for diplomacy, with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/02/kofi-annan-resigns-syria-envoy\" title=\"\">Annan plan abandoned</a> and the quieter efforts at reaching a US-Russia deal stalled.</p> <p>Most analysts predict that Syria's uprising against dictatorship \u2013 which began as a peaceful cross-sectarian movement calling for basic freedoms \u2013 will increasingly mutate into a sectarian civil war. Much of the western policy debate is moving on to the risks of prolonged state failure in a post-Assad future.</p> <p>Within the Arab world, the debate over Syria is increasingly becoming polarised along ideological and sectarian lines, as the country's strategic importance to the region's great powers seems to be obscuring the commonalities between the basic demands of the Syrian protesters and their counterparts in other Arab countries. Any efforts to draw back from the brink \u2013 and to stop the Syrian uprising against dictatorship being derailed by a sectarian regional proxy war \u2013 deserve attention.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad's visit, which an aide has said will go ahead, is a rare one. He last visited Saudi Arabia in 2007, at a time when the Gulf states were trying so hard to reach out to Iran that Qatar even invited him to join in the annual summit of the Gulf Co-operation Council (the regional organisation representing the six Gulf Arab monarchies, which was founded in 1981 partly in response to the perceived threat of the Iranian revolution).</p> <p>Although there is a long history of rivalry and competition between the Gulf Arab countries and Iran, relations have not always been so conflicted. Back in 2008, Ahmadinejad visited Bahrain and signed an agreement for Iran to supply Bahrain with natural gas. The deal, which seems almost unthinkable today, never materialised.</p> <p>By contrast, Ahmadinejad's most recent foray to the other side of the Gulf was in April, when he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/10189891\" title=\"\">toured Abu Musa</a>, an island occupied by Iran but claimed by the UAE. This <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/10204191\" title=\"\">prompted fury in the Gulf monarchies</a>, where rulers saw it as a sign of Iranian expansionist tendencies, and were frustrated by the lack of reaction from their western allies (who were preparing for talks with Iran over the nuclear issue and who are not deeply engaged on the islands issue).</p> <p>It is in Syria that the Saudi-Iranian confrontation has become the most pronounced and dangerous, but the two are competing for influence in the wider region. They back rival camps in Iraq, Lebanon, and to some extent Yemen and the Palestinian territories (though Hamas has always had some support in the Gulf and is now distancing itself from both Iran and Syria). They are also at odds over the treatment of Shia protesters in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia's own eastern province. Saudi officials routinely suggest that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/20/bahraini-uprising-iran\" title=\"\">Iran is fomenting the protests</a> in both cases.</p> <p>For its part, Iran's interests seem to be best served by giving only moral support to the protesters, so it can sit back and watch its rivals challenged from within, without the kind of direct involvement that could spark retaliation.</p> <p>Both Iran and Saudi Arabia are effective exploiters of \"soft power\", making use of their various media channels and religious networks to try to discredit the other.</p> <p>One of the disadvantages of this approach is that it is never quite clear how centralised the control of foreign policy really is. Another problem is that the Middle Eastern media are becoming increasingly sectarian \u2013 a trend that is <a href=\"http://www.chathamhouse.org/publications/papers/view/185115\" title=\"\">worrying many people</a> in the ethnically and religiously diverse countries of the Gulf.</p> <p>Now, with the collapse of Kofi Annan's mission to Syria, the Gulf Arab monarchies are becoming more open about their support for the Syrian opposition, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/22/saudi-arabia-syria-rebel-army\" title=\"\">including the armed Free Syrian Army</a>. Saudi Arabia has hosted a variety of Syrian opposition visitors, from members of the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood to <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/07/24/the_prince_and_the_revolution\" title=\"\">Assad's estranged uncle, Rifaat al-Assad</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/12/syria-defection-rocks-assad-questions\" title=\"\">Manaf Tlass</a>, a senior Syrian military officer who defected just a few weeks ago.</p> <p>The latter visitors illustrate that Saudi Arabia is not only supporting the Islamist opposition; it has its own concerns about the rising regional influence of the Muslim Brotherhood, whose focus on electoral politics represents a major challenge to the Saudi model of partnership between clerics and hereditary rulers.</p> <p>The UAE is also pursuing a delicate balancing act, as it is home to a number of Syrian National Council activists \u2013 who recently announced <a href=\"http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/syrian-ambassador-to-uae-defects-with-wife\" title=\"\">the defection of the Syrian ambassador to the UAE</a> \u2013 but is extremely wary of the role the Muslim Brotherhood could play in its own territory, and is investigating around 50 imprisoned Islamist political activists who are accused of conspiring with foreign organisations.</p> <p>Even before the Annan mission collapsed, the Saudi and UAE foreign ministers were expressing extreme frustration with what they see as international inaction over Syria. Saudi Arabia has never seemed particularly convinced by western diplomatic efforts; Kofi Annan did not visit Riyadh during his Syria mediation efforts, and neither Saudi Arabia nor Iran was included in the last \"Friends of Syria\" meeting.</p> <p>Most indications point to further conflict rather than a diplomatic resolution. But in the highly personalised realm of Saudi politics, a personal invitation from the king is symbolically important.</p> <p>In Lebanon, in 2008 and 2009, the confrontation between the Saudi-backed 14 March alliance and the Iranian-backed 8 March alliance occasionally looked like it could lead to renewed civil conflict. But there, the rival factions stepped back from the brink, negotiating power-sharing agreements before and after the 2009 elections.</p> <p>This would be far harder to achieve in Syria, with its daily bloodshed and its asymmetry of forces, but the cost of conflict is high enough for any remaining diplomatic options to be worth exploring.</p>",

  "<p>Mohammad Hanif is still trying to piece together the night his life changed for ever. One minute he was sitting down for dinner with his family at his home in the Maungdaw area of Burma's Arakan state. The next a mob wielding long knives and nail-studded clubs had burst through the door. Within minutes, two family members were dead. Within days the clan was separated, destitute and in flight [see footnote].</p> <p>\"They were our neighbours,\" said 65-year-old Hanif of the attackers who killed his son and son-in-law. \"They cut them down in front of my eyes \u2013 hacked at them the way knives slice through cabbage. We ran for our lives.\"</p> <p>Hanif, his wife and two daughters made for the jetty where they knew a boat was tied.</p> <p>\"My wife and younger daughter got separated and never made it to the boat,\" he said. \"We waited for them. But as the mob came nearer, we had to leave. It's been a month and I haven't heard from them. Maybe they're dead, maybe they're lost.\"</p> <p>Such tales are familiar in the remote fishing villages of south-eastern Bangladesh, where thousands of ethnic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/26/burma-rohingya-persecution-ethnic-violence\" title=\"Rohingya people Burma violence\">Rohingya</a> people, driven from their homes in neighbouring Burma, have been arriving since violence between the predominantly Buddhist Rakhine and the Rohingya \u2013 a Muslim minority with South Asian features \u2013 broke out in Arakan in early June.</p> <p>Most refugees carry horrifying accounts of murder, arson and rape perpetrated by Rakhine mobs, they say, with direct support from the administration. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates 80,000 people have been displaced by the violence in Arakan.</p> <p>Although both the Burmese and Bangladeshi governments say the violence has abated, fleeing refugees claim mass arrests and arson attacks aimed at driving out the Rohingyas continue.</p> <p>Bangladeshi authorities have refused to accept the refugees and have pushed back <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jun/29/burma-rohingya-refugees-bangladesh\" title=\"\">boatloads of Rohingyas</a>. Last week, Dhaka ordered three international charities helping Rohingya refugees with food and medicine \u2013 Doctors without Borders (MSF) and Action Against Hunger (ACF) as well as Britain's Muslim Aid UK \u2013 to stop operations immediately, arguing that they were creating a \"pull factor\" for refugees.</p> <p>Although the Bangladesh government claims the influx of refugees has stopped, the boats continue to come \u2013 mostly by night to avoid being arrested by Bangladeshi coast guard or shot at by Burmese border troops.</p> <p>Mohammad Hanif, his daughter Salma and five-year-old granddaughter Nafisa made it to Teknaf on Bangladesh's southeastern tip after spending two days in an open boat. Two attempts at landing were thwarted by Bangladeshi border guards, but the third attempt, under cover of darkness, succeeded. The three now hide in a ramshackle hut belonging to a fisherman who risks arrest by sheltering them.</p> <p>\"I've met people from my village who have fled here,\" said Hanif, squatting in the damp dirt-floor shack.</p> <p>\"The entire village was burnt down by Moghs [Rakhine] backed by Nasaka [Burmese border troops]. The government said it would protect us, but that was all talk. They want to exterminate us.\"</p> <p>On the run from the Bangladesh police and without any legitimate means of livelihood, Rohingyas face a bleak future on the Bangladesh side of the border. But that hasn't prevented Shah Noor, 23, from the Akyab area of Arakan state, from making the perilous trip along the Bay of Bengal to Teknaf.</p> <p>Noor, sheltering with a Bangladeshi fish trader he befriended two years ago, said he was sent to Bangladesh by his mother mid-July after police started rounding up young Rohingya men.</p> <p>\"I didn't want to leave but when the police arrived, she swore on her head that she couldn't bear to see me tortured,\" he said. \"So I ran away and hid in the bushes. The police told all the men to lie down and then they kicked them one by one. Many people have been arrested and turned over to Rakhine mobs.\"</p> <p>Such accounts are difficult to verify, since much of northern Arakan state is a no-go area for journalists and independent observers. But the refugees' claims are consistent with reports by human rights organisations such as <a href=\"http://amnesty.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Amnesty International </a>and <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/\" title=\"\">Human Rights Watch </a>that say security forces have targeted Muslim-inhabited areas following the riots. Rohingyas have been beaten, raped and killed by security forces and Rakhine Buddhists, according to <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/myanmar-rohingya-abuses-show-human-rights-progress-backtracking-2012-07-19\" title=\"\">Amnesty</a>.</p> <p>Burma declared a state of emergency on June 10,&#xa0;deploying troops to quell the unrest. But Human Rights Watch has accused the government of mounting a \"<a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/07/05/burma-mass-arrests-raids-rohingya-muslims\" title=\"\">brutal and biased police response</a>\". Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said the international community had been \"blinded by a romantic narrative of sweeping change\" in Burma.</p> <p>Rohingyas such as Hanif and Shah Noor accuse the government of fomenting the massacre by urging Rakhines to kill the Rohingya \"Kala\" (blacks) \u2013 an overtly racist strategy that turned neighbours into killers.</p> <p>They point out that many of the victims of the riots died of gunshot wounds, though the rioters were mainly armed with machetes and clubs. \"It was the government,\" Shah Noor said quietly. \"Without the military backing, the Moghs would never dare attack us. The government wants to drive us out.\"</p> <p>On 11 July, Burmese President Thein Sein suggested that the country could solve the problem by expelling all of its Rohingyas or by having the United Nations resettle them \u2013 a proposal that a United Nations official quickly rejected.</p> <p>Burma considers the Rohingya Muslims as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Bangladeshi officials say the geopolitical reality of the region makes that improbable.</p> <p>\"Why would any Bangladeshi move from his country where he is safe to where he is sure to be persecuted or killed because he has no rights there?\" asked one foreign ministry official in Dhaka, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p> <p>\"Since independence from British rule in 1947, Bangladesh has been more prosperous and open than Burma.\"</p> <p>The official pointed out that Burma had signed agreements with Bangladesh to take back refugees in 1979, 1994 and 2011.</p> <p>\"Voter lists of several elections in Burma in the last 50 years along with the agreements signed with the Bangladesh government prove that the Rohingya are citizens of Burma,\" he said.</p> <p>Mohammad Hanif says Arakan is the only home he knows.</p> <p>\"We hope the nations of the world will help us go back.

  "<p>I was in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janakpurdham\" title=\"\">Janakpur</a> to collect a painting by Gangawati Das, a 45-year-old Maithili woman who works in the <a href=\"http://www.asianart.com/exhibitions/jwdc/\" title=\"\">Janakpur Women's Development Centre</a>, an organisation set up in 1989 to promote the work of female artists. Maithili women are among the poorest and most marginalised people in the Terai plains of east Nepal.</p> <p>India's oldest love story began in Janakpur. It is where Rama, Prince of Ayodhya, came to marry the beautiful daughter of the King of Mithila, the lovely Sita. Their story is told in the most popular of the Indian epics, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramayana\" title=\"\">The Ramayana</a>, written around 500BC.</p> <p>It is also why Janakpur boasts 120 temples, including the fantastic Mogul-inspired <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janaki_Mandir\" title=\"\">Janaki Mandir</a>, one of Nepal's most picturesque. Next door to its elegant stucco facade is a hideous modern brick-and-glass building that commemorates the spot where Rama and Sita married. Thousands of pilgrims visit every day.</p> <p>Fortunately, the JWDC where Gangawati works is surrounded by green paddy fields and shady mango groves. The artists work sitting cross-legged on the floor painting on Nepali lokta paper, made from the bark of Himalayan shrubs.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maithil\" title=\"\">Maithili</a> culture it is only the women who paint; on the freshly plastered mud walls of their houses, they celebrate marriages, births or Hindu festivals such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali\" title=\"\">Deepawali</a>.</p> <p>The paintings usually depict some of the pantheon of Hindu gods. Nowadays, the artists have a more modern repertoire: recent commissions include posters that highlight the danger of HIV or the need to register for elections.</p> <p>When I visit Gangawati, the outside of her simple, mud-plastered house is adorned with a large painting of Hanuman, the Monkey King who helped Rama rescue Sita after she had been abducted by the evil King Ravana.</p> <p>Gangawati ushers me in for a cup of tea served by her daughter-in-law, who hides shyly behind her. Gangawati was married to her husband at the age of 16.</p> <p>I look at my painting. In the folk style of Maithili artists, Gangawati has painted all the birds around her home: tiny screech owls, a crested hoopoe, a colourful openbill stork and a dazzling blue peacock.</p> <p>The celestial lovers are here as well, eating a cob of corn while Hanuman watches discreetly over them.</p> <p><em>Every week </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/weekly\" title=\"\">Guardian Weekly</a><em> publishes a </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/series/letter-from\" title=\"\">Letter from</a><em> one of its readers from around the world.

  "<p>For years Bali, the pearl among the Sunda Islands, has been touted as an earthly paradise, thanks to the its tropical landscapes, its white sandy beaches, the tormented beauty of its Hindu temples and its inhabitants' reputation for kindness and tolerance.</p> <p>But this idyllic spot may soon be a thing of the past, with the threat of Bali \u2013 population 3.5 million \u2013 changing beyond recognition, a prey to the accumulated effects of mass tourism, unbridled consumption of resources and environmental collapse.</p> <p>\"From the 1970s onwards Bali really became a tourist destination,\" says Wayan Suardana, head of&#xa0;Walhisimilan, a conservation group campaigning for the environment. \"But to begin with it was mainly cultural tourism. Now we are seeing mass tourism. And that's a problem.\"</p> <p>Hundreds of hotels use up a large share of freshwater reserves, with each four-star room consuming 300 litres a day. \"By 2015 Bali could be facing a drinking water crisis,\" Suardana says.</p> <p>More than a million visitors came to Bali in 2001. The figures for 2011 suggest that numbers have more than doubled since, ultimately unaffected by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/21/indonesia-militant-bali-bombings\" title=\"\">2002 terror attack</a>, which left 202 dead, including many Australians. Every year 700 hectares of land is lost to hotels, luxury housing for rich foreigners or just roads to improve connections on the island. Every day some 13,000 cubic metres of waste is dumped on public tips and only half is recycled. With 13% more cars on the roads every year, the steadily increasing traffic causes massive jams.</p> <p>In an attempt to mitigate the ill effects of mass tourism on the local Hindu culture \u2013 an exception in largely Muslim Indonesia \u2013 the authorities have introduced environmental legislation. One of its provisions makes it compulsory for resorts to be set back at least 150 metres from beaches, with no hotels within 5km of Hindu temples.</p> <p>So far this initiative has made no difference. Efforts to decentralise government in Indonesia \u2013 a patchwork of 17,000 islands with a population of 240 million \u2013 have given a disproportionate share of power to the <em>bupati</em> (elected high sheriffs), who run areas roughly equivalent to a British county. The bupati are not in favour of the new law. \"The law on environmental protection has been passed but the bupati, who have financial interests and are hand-in-glove with property developers, have done all they can to prevent the law from being enforced,\" alleges the deputy leader of Bali's regional assembly, Ketut Adnyana.</p> <p>\"Local leaders have no long-term perspective,\" he adds. \"They want a quick return on investments and tourism allows that. The irony is that one day, when development has reached a certain level, visitors will no longer find what they seek here.\"</p> <p>In January 2011, the governor of Bali, Made Mangku Pastika, issued a ban on new buildings in heavily developed areas, warning that Bali was in danger of becoming a sterile land bristling with concrete. The ban is far from popular with investors.</p> <p>\"Tourism is partly due to the attraction of our culture: if mass tourism develops in a way that threatens our culture, we will lose our specific attraction,\" says Ida Bagus Ngurah Wijaya, head of the Bali tourist board and the owner of a hotel at Sanur, a prime destination.</p> <p>\"We have used culture as merchandise,\" says poet and theatre director Ketut Yuliarsa, a native of Ubud. He is horrified by the turn of events. \"The Balinese are deeply attached to their religion and culture: they spend a lot of time in the temples and respect the ritual. But mass tourism has upset such practices: the diversity of local cultures and the specific character of certain rites are being harmonised. Foreigners are offered a standardised package,\" the poet explains.</p> <p>It is all the more difficult to halt such trends, because the travel trade does have a positive side. \"People are better off, living standards have improved. Many Balinese are unaware of the changes going on,\" Yuliarsa says.</p> <p>\"Four-fifths of Balinese society is deeply committed to daily worship,\" says Audrey Lamou, who headed the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise on the island for several years. \"But some youths, who must pay a form of monetary compensation to their village when they cannot attend ritual gatherings, are fed up with such strict rules.\"</p> <p>At the same time, \"the Balinese are increasingly obsessed with easy money,\" Lamou says. \"Institutions such as gamelans [musical ensembles] are dying out and the Balinese language is gradually losing ground to the official language of Indonesia. With such massive changes it sometimes looks as if, in cultural terms, the population is heading for disaster.\"</p> <p>Compared with other holiday venues in south-east Asia, Bali has retained much of its magic, at least in the areas so far spared by mass tourism. But if nothing is done to halt current trends, it may suffer the same fate as other dream destinations.<strong> </strong></p> <p>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/\" title=\"\">Le Monde</a></p>",

Alcuin, who was originally from York but was writing from the safety of Charlemagne's court at Aix-la-Chapelle, said </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>fornications, adulteries and incest have poured over the land, so that these sins have been committed with no shame and even against the handmaidens dedicated to God.

A couple of generations later, however, in 875, with the Vikings by now occupying most of northern England south of the Tyne, and their leader Halfdan threatening to attack northwards, the monks decided that it would be better to move their treasures somewhere safer \u2013 St Cuthbert, on his deathbed, was reported to have said that, if the place appeared threatened, they should</p> <blockquote> <p>take up my bones from the tomb and remove them from this spot.</p> </blockquote> <p> The hunt for sanctuary saw the monks and their cargo of bones visiting many places from Cumbria to Yorkshire, with the lengthy anabasis eventually leading to the foundation of Durham Cathedral.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394305897\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/6/1344259075423/lindisfarne_castle.jpg\" alt=\"Lindisfarne Castle\" width=\"160\" height=\"120\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lindisfarne Castle \"with its battled walls\".

  "<p>How do you drive a rover that's 248m kilometres away?</p> <p>The advantages of having wheels on your Mars lander are obvious \u2013 having safely delivered your scientifically priceless instruments over interplanetary distances, the last thing you need is for a particularly fascinating rock to be tantalisingly out of reach. When you're able to move your instruments to your target, it's so much easier to answer the mysteries of the universe, or at least a tiny part of it.</p> <p>The three <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/index.html\" title=\"Nasa: Apollo programme\">Apollo</a> astronaut crews who travelled to the moon with their own rovers in 1971-72 just had to hop in and drive off to explore sites well away from their landing sites. For unmanned rovers, however, adding wheels introduces more complexity and expense. Although the obvious way to drive a rover that's far away is through direct remote control, radio commands sent at the speed of light still take a long time to travel the huge distances between driver and wheels.</p> <p>This was a problem for the first unmanned planetary rovers: the Soviet Union's <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/multimedia/lroimages/lroc-20100318.html\" title=\"Nasa's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spots Russian rovers\">two Lunokhods</a>, which landed on the moon in 1970 and 1973. Despite commands taking only 1.3s to reach the rovers, the team of five controlling them suffered from the stress of always trying to second-guess where the rover would be a few seconds hence. One small steering mistake on a slope could have left the rovers stranded like upturned beetles on the lunar surface. Despite the strains involved in driving them, both missions were hugely successful, with the wheeled robots operating for several months and covering tens of kilometres. You can see tracks <a href=\"http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/news/index.php?/archives/538-Lunokhod-1-Revisited.html\" title=\"LRO: Lunokhod 1\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/news/index.php?/archives/198-Soviet-Union-Lunar-Rovers.html#extended\" title=\"LRO: Soviet Lunar Rovers\">here</a>.</p> <p>Such remote control is largely impractical on Mars: radio signals currently take almost 14 minutes to reach it, so if Curiosity, known also as Mars Science Laboratory, was being sent individual commands to make each movement, it'd take almost 30 minutes to check whether it had responded correctly. Mission operators either have to live with the painfully slow progress associated with operating a craft very gingerly so far away, or develop sophisticated fail-safe onboard systems to control rovers' movements and avoid any hazards.</p> <p>The first mini-rover was delivered to Mars on the <a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1971-049F\" title=\"Nasa: Soviet Mars 3 Lander\">Soviet Mars 3 lander</a> in 1971 but perished within minutes, having landed in a dust storm. Twenty-six years later, Nasa's <a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/index1.html\" title=\"Nasa: Mars Pathfinder\">Mars Pathfinder</a> was delivered to the surface following a very bouncy, airbag-cushioned landing. Its Sojourner rover, which was the size of a microwave oven, trundled around a few metres from its landing pad carrying cameras and an X-ray spectrometer to test the make-up of rocks. It was issued regular commands to drive to new targets which it followed while continually testing for hazards using lasers, imaging and tilt sensors. Sojourner's baby steps continued for almost three months until the lander through which it was communicating with Earth fell silent.</p> <p>In 2003/04, Nasa's <a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/\" title=\"Nasa: Spirit and Opportunity\">Mars Exploration Rovers</a>, Spirit and Opportunity, landed on opposite sides of the planet to begin its most extensive surface exploration yet. Controlling these more sophisticated vehicles sometimes proved fiddly, especially early on. \"Though the hardware and software had been thoroughly tested, you never know exactly how they're going to perform until you start driving them,\" recalls former operations team member Dr Craig Leff, now working on the European Space Agency's <a href=\"http://exploration.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=46048\" title=\"ESA: ExoMars programme\">ExoMars rover</a> at University College London's <a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/\" title=\"Mullard Space Science Laboratory\">Mullard Space Science Laboratory</a>. \"They will all have little variances and you need to learn the idiosyncrasies of any particular vehicle.\"</p> <p>The rovers were equipped with autonomous navigation: when told their next target, they planned their own route to that spot and avoided hazards on their own. The hazard-avoidance systems were very sensitive early on in the mission, but operators became more comfortable with pushing the rovers' abilities, and sometimes drove the rovers blind to maximise their speed. However, Opportunity spent almost 40 days immobile after an innocent-looking dune turned out to be a sand trap.</p> <p>Although meant to operate for only three months each, Spirit didn't fall silent until 2010, after two of its wheels stopped turning. It eventually succumbed to the harsh Martian winter. Opportunity is still going strong, and has driven 34km in the 3,000 Martian days since landing. It recently snapped <a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/press/opportunity/20120522a.html\" title=\"Nasa: Dark Shadows on Mars: Scene from Durable NASA Rover \">this view eastwards</a> across the Endeavour crater on Mars.</p> <p>The Mars Science Laboratory team obviously hope to clock as much mileage from the latest rover, but once the dust has settled today at Gale Crater, they plan to go easy on Curiosity: it may be a week before it leaves its landing spot.</p> <p>Once it gets going, progress is expected to be quicker than for Spirit and Opportunity. Nuclear power means there's no need to wait for sunlight to turn Curiosity's wheels, which are bigger to carry it largely unhindered across the rocky surface, and it won't be affected by dim lighting conditions during dust storms. It should cover at least 19km during its two-year mission.</p> <p>Scientists are eager for Curiosity to get rolling, but with no insurance or breakdown cover, it won't put its foot to the floor. Its maximum speed will be ninety metres per hour - about twice that of a giant tortoise.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mssl.ucl.ac.uk/~ghj/\" title=\"\"><em>Geraint Jones</em></a><em> is a British Science Association Media Fellow and planetary scientist at UCL's Mullard Space Science Laboratory in Surrey</em></p>",
  "<p>For many years, London schools \u2013 and particularly its secondary schools \u2013 have had an unwelcome reputation. In the 1980s and 1990s it was common for parents in London to send their children to state primary schools, which were generally perceived as good, but then to opt for private schools if they could afford it, or to move out to the suburbs or further if they could not, once their children approached secondary school age. There were undoubtedly serious problems in many London secondary schools, but even 30 years ago, London's schools were actually pretty effective \u2013 and its secondary schools were actually more effective than its primary schools in terms of academic progress made by students.</p> <p>This comes as a surprise to many people \u2013 so much so that some people frankly refuse to believe it \u2013 because they assume that schools that get good results must be good schools. However, data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) shows that one cannot judge the quality of a school by its results in any OECD country. In most countries, the school a child attends accounts for less than 10% of the variation in the results he or she gets. The remaining differences in results are caused by differences in the students, their backgrounds, and a number of other factors over which the school has no control. In fact the same OECD data shows that the average achievement in private schools in the UK is the same as that in state schools, once social class is taken into account, even though the average class size is 13 in the private sector and 25 in the state sector.</p> <p>Most people grasp this intuitively with hospitals. Few would be surprised to learn that the mortality rate at Great Ormond Street hospital for children was higher than for ordinary hospitals, because people realise the hospital takes many children that other hospitals cannot help. Low mortality rates might indicate a good hospital but could equally well be a sign that the hospital admitted only people who weren't very ill. For this reason, the NHS compares hospitals not in terms of mortality rates, but in terms of risk-adjusted mortality rates, that take into account how ill the patients at each hospital were.</p> <p>When we do the same for secondary schools \u2013 when we compare schools in terms of how much students learn \u2013 we find that schools in London have been rather good for a considerable time. Ten years ago, only one secondary school in six across the country was as good as the average secondary school in Tower Hamlets in terms of the progress made by students.</p> <p>However, in the last three years, something even more extraordinary has happened. London schools have been outperforming schools in the rest of the country not just in terms of the progress made by students, but also in GCSE grades. Two years ago, London became the only rich world capital city in which student achievement was higher than the national average, and last year \u2013 as reported in the Financial Times on Monday \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-19151471\" title=\"\">London schools outperformed those in all the other English regions</a>.</p> <p>As the Chinese say, \"Success has a thousand fathers\", and a number of people have queued up to claim that their pet initiative was the cause of this extraordinary achievement. Some have claimed that the improvement is due to the conversion of secondary schools into academies, but the truth is that the GCSE grades of academies have been no better than equally low-performing schools that were not converted into academies. Others have claimed that schemes to increase the quality of entrants into teaching such as \"<a href=\"http://www.teachfirst.org.uk/TFHome/\" title=\"\">Teach First</a>\" are the reason, but there is no evidence that Teach First teachers are any better (or any worse) than those trained through traditional university-based teacher training programmes. Moreover, since Teach First teachers made up less than 5% of the teaching force in London schools during this period, even if they were as good as the very best teachers (which is highly unlikely), their impact could not have produced the improvements seen in London.</p> <p>The truth is much more prosaic. London's success has been the result of focusing on the boring, unspectacular task of helping teachers improve their practice. <a href=\"http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/resources/london-challenge\" title=\"\">London Challenge</a> supported London's schools but also, through the \"Families of schools\" reports asked tough questions about why similar students in different schools got very different results.</p> <p>We now know that the <a href=\"http://psychologyandeducation.edublogs.org/files/2010/11/HESEDU2018-22nnshp.pdf\" title=\"\">quality of teachers is the single most important determinant of how much students learn</a>. This has led some to obsess about replacing existing teachers with better ones, either by sacking the least effective, or improving the quality of new entrants to the profession. The lesson from London's success is that by themselves such measures are the policy equivalent of rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic. Improvements in student achievement will come from investing in the teachers already in our schools, and helping them do an even better job.</p>",

  "<p>Let me start by saying that I am not a proponent of directing academics away from blue-sky research towards second-rate contract research for the highest bidder. I am passionate about the long-term economic, social and cultural value of intellectual exploration through curiosity-driven research. But there seems to be a commonly held view that if you wish to preserve academic freedom, it's impossible to provide any substantial economic benefit to the UK, and that attempting to do so will create profound damage to our research base. I simply don't buy that argument.</p> <p>The UK needs an economic game changer and we are incredibly fortunate to have a platform from which we can launch it \u2013 our universities. We already make a major contribution to GDP yet we can do much more if academics engage even more extensively with business. We should be using the base of our higher education sector to help our businesses innovate and grow, to encourage overseas corporations to invest in the UK and to create jobs for UK citizens. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/aug/02/the-value-of-research-collaborations\" title=\"\">Many academics already do collaborate with business</a>, recognising that it can enrich and enhance the quality of scholarly work. Such interactions will become increasingly important if we are to remain competitive in the global business that is higher education.</p> <p>The government started well in 2010 by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/oct/19/spending-review-science-budget-spared\" title=\"\">protecting the research budget</a> \u2013 a tall order but essential given that our competitors are investing much more into research. What is frustrating is we are not joined-up in using our assets for the best interests of the UK. Research activity generates highly trained staff, as well as data, knowledge, and intellectual property (IP), and we should use them to our competitive advantage. We all know the benefits of seeing new developments, from academics who attend the latest conference to see unpublished work to businesses who have always recognised the importance of technology adoption and first-mover advantage. Recognising the value to business of access to our research first is a no brainer.</p> <p>The question, then, is why, when we create some of the best knowledge and IP in the world, are we intent on pursuing initiatives such as <a href=\"http://www.easyaccessip.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Easy Access IP</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/jul/23/finch-report-open-access-research\" title=\"\">gold open access</a>, without giving due consideration to the benefits for our economy. I am not opposed to the underlying principles of these initiatives, but in some cases they are unnecessary and in others they are unlikely to work. At worst they could mean that, as a nation, we will spend more money, do less research and accrue less economic benefit for the UK. In my view, we can be smarter than this and use these assets as part of a package of measures to collectively make the UK the most attractive place for businesses committed to generating jobs and growth here.</p> <p>What then should we be doing? We should create a network of research and innovation enterprise zones across the nation; places where large corporations could work alongside SMEs and university researchers from across sectors, rubbing shoulders, exchanging ideas and researching and innovating together. This would generate exciting new discoveries and then ensure their transformation at lightning speed into products, jobs and growth in the UK, for the UK. I'm not simply talking about science parks \u2013 but genuine research and innovation accelerators, promoting inward investment on scale and generating thousands of jobs.</p> <p>The government would need to offer significant incentives to achieve this goal, perhaps including reduced corporation tax and flexibility on VAT to allow sharing of spaces. University researchers could make their research outputs preferentially available for a fixed period, perhaps alongside the embargo period of a <a href=\"http://www.ercim.eu/publication/Ercim_News/enw64/jeffery.html\" title=\"\">green open access policy</a>, providing an early view and hence opportunities for early uptake. We could also use these zones to pilot new ideas to liberate us from the stranglehold of red tape and burdensome regulation around employment law, immigration policies, procurement and others, which currently inhibit entrepreneurs and stifle growth.</p> <p>Finally, the main assets of our universities are our people. It is people who innovate, collaborate and discover, not institutions. We need to nurture this talent and to boost innovation through enabling academics to gain exposure to new and different techniques in different settings. We need to enable people from across universities \u2013 from professors, to post-docs and PhD students \u2013 to move more freely amongst different types of institutions than is currently possible. We could establish a scheme whereby high-fliers rotate around a selection of small business, larger companies and university research departments to gain a variety of experience to develop new ways of innovating.</p> <p>We are going to see profound changes in the next few years. The shift in economic power is clear and growing \u2013 and the signs are there for similar shifts in the global higher education market. We can chose to maintain a 19th century view of higher education, or we can recognise academic research can be enhanced by serious collaboration with external enterprises. We must be bold and recognise that the depth of our knowledge base provides a competitive advantage that most countries are desperately trying to emulate, because they know that it creates enormous economic, social and cultural value. We have the opportunity of a generation to build a sustainable economy for the 21st century \u2013 but we need to open our eyes and seize the opportunity.</p> <p><em>Professor Stephen Caddick is vice-provost (Enterprise) and Vernon professor of chemistry at </em><a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>University College London</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>So we are now living in \"betting shop Britain\". <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/4od/\" title=\"\">Last night's Dispatches documentary on Channel 4</a> has focused minds on the sight of more bookmakers on the high street, and the seeming explosion of quick-play, high-stake slot machines known as fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs). Confronted with stories of people losing everything on FOBTs, Harriet Harman, the former Labour minister who led the liberalisation, said she had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/05/labour-mistake-gambling-law-harman\" title=\"\">made a \"mistake\"</a>.</p> <p>So why did MPs from all three parties suggest last month that betting shops should be allowed even more FOBTs? As bizarre as it may sound, some MPs feel they missed a golden opportunity to recognise gambling as legitimate entertainment back in 2005. The <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/120724-gambling-report-publication/\" title=\"\">select committee report last month</a> was an attempt to fix some of the perceived mistakes of the 2005 Gambling Act. Dropping the arbitrary cap of four FOBTs per betting shop will stop bookmakers from opening up more stores, and prevent so-called \"clustering\" on Britain's high streets, the MPs' report argued.</p> <p>There is also a lack of hard evidence on how dangerous these machines are. A report by NatCen and Geofutures, produced last year before the Dispatches documentary, showed that seaside areas and satellite towns around major cities with higher deprivation tended to have <a href=\"http://www.geofuturesonline.com/RGF/\" title=\"\">more betting shops and gambling machines</a>. However, it did not set out to answer whether this has created more gambling addicts.</p> <p>Nor have many tried to answer the wider question of why it is wrong for the poor to gamble and not the rich. Some betting advocates have said the clustering of betting shops is a simple case of supply and demand. They point out, slightly tongue-in-cheek, that the high street in Barnes, west London is full of estate agents. \"Not everyone wants them but the demand is clearly there,\" they say.</p> <p>Some of the more colourful suggestions by select committee MPs last month, including more slot machines in betting shops, are unlikely to ever be picked up by ministers. The government already has enough rebellions on its hands over Europe and House of Lords reform without stepping into the explosive area of gambling.</p> <p>Another reason for the government's reluctance is what gambling companies ruefully call the \"Daily Mail effect\". Coalition ministers are too frightened to iron out glaring kinks in the 2005 act, the industry argues, in case they are on the receiving end of a bruising crusade by the newspaper. Harman admitted that Labour was influenced by the Daily Mail over gambling policy, and wrongly limited the number of slot machines in casinos, when she appeared before the select committee earlier this year.</p> <p>To complicate matters, even the definition of problem gambling is disputed. Should we be talking about \"gambling addicts\", \"gambling obsessives\", or, a wider catch-all, \"problem gamblers\"? That is without looking at the thousands of under-18s spending hours on social poker and casino games on their mobiles and Facebook.</p> <p>Last year's <a href=\"http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/research__consultations/research/bgps.aspx\" title=\"\">British gambling prevalence survey</a> found a small but measurable rise in problem gambling to 0.9% of the population, or 451,000 adults, since the liberalisation introduced by New Labour. Putting aside differences in methodology, Britain has the same rate of problem gamblers as Germany and Norway, where much of the gambling is under government control. Britain is also some way behind Hong Kong, Singapore and the United States.</p> <p>And it is not just British politicians who are grappling with the problem. Across Europe governments are being asked to look at the spread of high-stake slot machines. In Sweden, the state-run gambling monopoly Svenska Spel \u2013 supposedly free of the hunger for profits that drives publicly listed bookmakers \u2013 is also under pressure for installing addictive slot machines in poorer areas. Likewise, in Italy local councils are trying to stop the relentless expansion of slot gambling. Italians have already spent \u20ac44bn on gambling this year, more than half of that on slots, and are well on course to outspend the \u20ac80bn they gambled in 2011. More than \u20ac8bn of that went to the Italian government in gambling taxes.</p> <p>The question is whether here in the UK the economic benefits of FOBTs outweigh the drain on people's incomes? Perhaps betting operators will also ask themselves whether extra FOBTs in each of their shops are worth a sustained bout of negative headlines.</p>",
  "<h2>Obviously everybody has heard of HSBC and Barclays, but what is Standard Chartered and why do we care?</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/07/standard-chartered-short-history\" title=\"\">Standard Chartered is a bank that offers similar services to HSBC and Barclays</a> \u2013 some customers hold standard savings accounts, credit cards and loans while it also has business and investment banking divisions. But it doesn't offer retail banking in the UK, concentrating instead on emerging and Asian markets. Its heritage in Hong Kong means it is as familiar a name on the high street as the main banks here.</p> <p>It is important to the UK because it has been listed on the London Stock Exchange since 1969 and London is the bank's headquarters. The City is also a key part of its investment banking business, while a significant part of its private and international banking operations are run from its London base. Oh, and the banks sponsors the shirts of Liverpool Football Club.</p> <h2>So what is it supposed to have done?</h2> <p>One of the bank's regulators, the New York state <a href=\"http://www.dfs.ny.gov/banking/ea120806.pdf\" title=\"\">department of financial services (DFS), has accused the bank of skirting US sanctions</a> by running a rogue unit that schemed with Iran's government to hide more than $250bn (\u00a3160bn) in illegal transactions for nearly a decade. The DFS's report states: \"For almost 10 years, [Standard Chartered] schemed with the government of Iran and hid from regulators roughly 60,000 secret transactions, involving at least $250bn, and reaping [Standard Chartered] hundreds of millions of dollars in fees. [Standard Chartered's] actions left the US financial system vulnerable to terrorists, weapons dealers, drug kingpins and corrupt regimes, and deprived law enforcement investigators of crucial information used to track all manner of criminal activity.\" It said it achieved this by a process called \"wire-stripping\".</p> <h2>Wire-stripping?</h2> <p>The process of changing banking codes to hide where a transaction has come from \u2013 often by altering the Swift code which identifies the beneficiary's bank. The DFS report cites an example it claims was contained within a Standard Chartered manual, which explained to staff how they should achieve this. The DFS report said the directive read: \"Ensure that if the field 52 of the payment is blank or displayes [sic] any Swift code that it is overtyped at the repair stage to a '.' \u2026 (Note: if this is not done then the Iranian Bank Swift code may appear \u2013 depending on routing \u2013 on the payment message being sent to [the New York branch]).\"</p> <h2>These allegations sound similar to the recent money-laundering allegations against HSBC \u2013 and the sanctions violations charges against Barclays in 2010. Are they the same?</h2> <p>They are similar, but there is a big difference between the cases.</p> <h2>Which is?</h2> <p>Unlike HSBC and Barclays, Standard Chartered refutes the allegations. In a statement it says it \"strongly rejects the position and portrayal of facts made by the New York state department of financial services\" and points out that it has previously highlighted in its annual report how it is conducting a review of its historical compliance and that it has been discussing that review with US agencies, including the DFS, the department of justice, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Federal Reserve Group of New York and the district attorney of New York since January 2010.</p> <p>Following that enquiry, Standard Chartered said it \"does not believe the order issued by the DFS presents a full and accurate picture of the facts. The analysis, that the group shared with all the US agencies, demonstrates that throughout the period the group acted to comply, and overwhelmingly did comply, with US sanctions and the regulations relating to U-turn payments. As we have disclosed to the authorities, well over 99.9% of the transactions relating to Iran complied with the U-turn regulations. The total value of transactions which did not follow the U-turn was under $14m.\"</p> <h2>Hang on. What is a U-turn payment?</h2> <p>Until November 2008, the US Office of Foreign Assets Control rules had permitted, under limited circumstances and with close regulatory supervision, US financial institutions to process certain transactions for Iranian banks, individuals, and other entities. Pursuant to federal regulations, such transactions were permissible in some circumstances provided that they were initiated offshore by non-Iranian foreign banks and only passed through the US financial system on the way to other non-Iranian foreign banks. Such transactions are commonly referred to as U-turns.</p>",
  "<p>\"No news is good news\", the old dictum goes. But someone should explain to Mariano Rajoy, Spain's prime minister, that it only qualifies as good news if there really is no news. This doesn't mean firing as many journalists as you can. Even if you sack almost everybody from TV and radio, as will soon be the case if the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/05/spanish-government-critics-national-tv\" title=\"\">purge</a> of Spanish public-sector broadcasting is to continue, there will still be news, and that news will presumably be just as bad as it has been up until now. Getting a new cohort of faithful journalists to suppress or distort the facts won't turn it into good news; it will turn it into what is technically known as \"lies\".</p> <p>Ana Pastor, Xabier Fortes, Juan Ram\u00f3n Lucas, Fran Llorente \u2026 the casualty list from the Spanish national broadcaster (RTVE) reads like a competition for the most popular journalist in the country. But as the spin doctors would put it, state broadcasting in Spain has never been about the popularity of the channel, it's about the popularity of the government. And with <a href=\"http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2012/07/28/actualidad/1343506962_981706.html\" title=\"\">polls</a> already indicating a 16% fall in support since March, this government seems to be running low on that.</p> <p>And yet to Rajoy it's simply unbelievable that his austerity policies \u2013 harsh, unpopular and, what is probably worse, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19009751\" title=\"\">ineffective</a> \u2013 may have anything to do with the quick erosion of his political capital. He and his advisers are convinced that it is the national broadcaster's fault, staffed as it is with unsympathetic journalists who keep talking about cutbacks and unemployment. That the government's reaction has been to make them unemployed and to cut back on RTVE budgets is an irony that seems to have escaped ministers.</p> <p>Purges are not news at RTVE. But in 2006, at least, a decision was made to put an end to this Tony Soprano-like approach to human resources. A new law was passed that required a two-thirds parliamentary majority for key appointments in RTVE. The government has seen it as a matter of the utmost urgency to scrap that law and return to the good old vendetta system. That, rather than the personal fate of a particular number of news anchors, is what is worrying, because this Putin-esque \"changing the rules of the game as you go\" game is quickly becoming the government's only firm policy. It has also tried to change the way in which judges are selected, and is toying with the idea of touching up the electoral law, without seeking any consensus with the rest of political forces, in order to tip the scales in its favour in an upcoming <a href=\"http://ansamed.ansa.it/ansamed/en/news/sections/economics/2012/07/27/Crisis-Galicia-cut-14-regional-MPs_7244864.html\" title=\"\">regional election</a>.</p> <p>But then there's also the way in which journalism is understood, or misunderstood, in Spain. Maybe the sacked journalists are left-leaning or progressive. So what? While everybody expects reporters working for private media organisations to be biased to the point of militancy (as they are), those working for the state media are not supposed to have any views at all. Actually, the opposite is true: all views should be represented. That's the point of having a public media \u2013 those who lose elections pay taxes too.</p> <p>Spain has always struggled with impartiality and objectivity. Impartiality \u2013 never taking sides \u2013 is neither possible nor desirable in journalism. Objectivity is what is needed, and that means simply handling the raw data with care and with honesty.</p> <p>That is why it's interesting that most of those who have been dismissed are interviewers, a job that only makes sense when the journalist takes the opposing side. Politicians in Spain are not used to being contradicted, or even pressed to answer a question. They expect the interviewer to nod sheepishly while they deliver their speech, and most do. The newly jobless represented a new trend in Spanish political journalism: they asked real questions to our political leaders. That's why they were popular. And that's why the government, increasingly, is not.</p>",
  "<p>Despite protestations to the contrary, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_science_fiction\" title=\"\">hard SF</a> is a boys' club that is undermining its own potential by resisting the contributions of women writers.</p> <p>There's a logical fallacy in this club's claims that it welcomes women members, which is rather like the rhetoric of the well-schooled military officer.&#xa0;Of course they want&#xa0;women in the army. It's just, well, a soldier must be physically strong, naturally violent and preferably&#xa0;have a todger so you can pee standing up. Any woman who fulfils those criteria is more than welcome to take the king's shilling! Women writers are more than welcome in hard SF, assuming they have a background in the hard sciences and value hard logic to the exclusion of all emotional experience. And while it's not compulsory to have a personality at the far end of the autistic spectrum, it certainly helps. &#xa0;</p> <p>Not that there are no women who fulfil these criteria. But it's the implicit male chauvinism of SF that has alienated many of its greatest women writers. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/margaretatwood\" title=\"\">Margaret Atwood</a> has consistently railed against being pigeonholed within the SF genre despite writing some of its greatest work. Alice Sheldon became one of SF's most significant writers under the pen-name <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Tiptree,_Jr.\" title=\"\">James Tiptree Jr</a>, in a period when the biased belief that women could not write SF caused US author <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/robert-silverberg\" title=\"\">Robert Silverberg</a> to state categorically that \"on the basis of his writing\" Tiptree could not be a woman. As a consequence, hard SF continues to be less than the sum of its parts, a genre that succeeds in investigating the revolutionary potential of science and technology, but fails in understanding the emotional complexity of that revolution.</p> <p>In her debut novel vN, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/madeline-ashby\" title=\"\">Madeline Ashby</a> takes on that perennial trope of hard SF, the android. Ashby's androids are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_machine\" title=\"\">Von Neuman machines</a>, capable of self-replicating and hence a credible model for artificial life that could arise as a consequence of nanotechnology. Significantly, the three generations of vN at the heart of this novel are also all female. Ashby's vN are not constrained by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/isaac-asimov\" title=\"\">Isaac Asimov</a>'s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics\" title=\"\">three laws of robotics</a>. Instead, they have been engineered with a much more debilitating weakness: empathy. Unable to bear the suffering of humans the vN are enslaved by their own kindness as servants, wives and often far worse. In Ashby's expert hands vN cuts a painful incision into the emotional complexity of oppression in our society, and the way love can feed the worst kinds of hate. vN is a powerful novel and a fine exemplar of exactly the perspectives chauvinist SF so often stifles.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/tricia-sullivan\" title=\"\">Tricia Sullivan</a> is the writer of some of the most conceptually complex novels in contemporary SF, and recently <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Tricia-Sullivan/e/B000APTADI/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_pop_1\" title=\"\">reissued as ebooks</a>.

Sullivan sets up a rational explanation for Xavier's obsession, but nonetheless takes great glee in toying with her maturity-phobic male lead. Men who never grow up, live in video games and fail to communicate their emotions to the outside world \u2013 it's almost as though Sullivan has something to say about SF geeks.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/mjohn-harrison\" title=\"\">M John Harrison </a>is not a woman.

That's not a mere technical challenge, but a necessity for any literature that seeks to understand what it is to be human in a reality shaped by science and technology. Which is, of course, now the task of all literature.</p> <p>There's nothing more likely to infuriate a hard SF fan than confusing their rigorous, scientifically grounded genre with the namby-pamby made-up magic of high fantasy. But chauvinist SF creates a comforting fantasy world of its own. One free from emotional complexity, and hence largely free of women. The reality of our technological future is that it presents an enormous challenge to our psychological and spiritual state as humans. If we're to find real insights into that challenge, it won't come from the narrow escapism of chauvinist SF. If the genre is to fulfil its potential it must not just encourage women writers but focus intently on the contribution they have to make.</p>",
  "<p><strong>How did you first come into contact with </strong><a href=\"http://contactmcr.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Contact</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p> <p>It was through Benji Reid and <a href=\"http://www.breakingcycles.co.uk/\" title=\"\">his company Breaking Cycles</a> \u2013 we met at the <a href=\"http://www.hhtf.org/\" title=\"\">Hip-Hop Theatre Festival</a> in Washington DC in 2004 and really connected. Theatre and hip-hop are my two main interests and passions. The next step was bringing him over to New York to co-direct a theatre project I was working on and we kept building a relationship from there.</p> <p>I'd never been to the UK at that stage but when Benji was describing <a href=\"http://contactmcr.com/\" title=\"\">Contact</a> to me, it sounded like a really amazing place. My father and I came over and did a double bill in space one in 2005 and I was blown away. I've worked in the arts and with young people for most of my career but very rarely have I found a building-based organisation or venue with young people so much at its heart.</p> <p><strong>Is it true you grew up surrounded by theatre?</strong></p> <p>A lot of my childhood was spent in a theatre building \u2013 my parents were part of <a href=\"http://www.livingtheatre.org/\" title=\"\">Living Theatre</a>, one of the important political theatre companies in the US. The first three years of my life we lived as this big community and then Living Theatre went back on the road and my parents didn't want to raise me touring. Then, when I was ten or eleven, I began to break with theatre \u2013 it didn't really seem to connect with my generation at the time, and that's when I started to get into hip-hop and spoken word.</p> <p><strong>When did you see your two worlds coming together?</strong></p> <p>In New York I was aware of performance artists like Danny Hoch, but it was really when I moved to Australia that things came full circle. I went for family reasons, to visit my grandmother who was ill at the time. But in my first few days, I mentioned to people I was interested in theatre and hip-hop and someone said: \"Come to this gathering.\" I went to check out this old powerhouse in the western suburbs of Sydney and discovered this fantastic community-theatre project where I ended up being a volunteer.</p> <p><strong>What gave rise to hip-hop theatre as an artform?</strong></p> <p>I think it was a frustration that theatre didn't really represent the wider community. A lot of theatre can be very historic, traditional and classical, and people started saying: \"Actually, we're going to tell stories and show perspectives of people right now.\" A friend of mine once called it: in Shakespeare's time, it was the upper classes who spoke in verse; in modern times, it's everyone else. Hip-hop also brings in these incredible dance, visual and musical traditions, and that's what I'm passionate about in theatre \u2013 hip-hop or not, companies that have a rich language.</p> <p><strong>Was it daunting taking on the artistic director role at Contact in 2009?</strong></p> <p>It was a huge leap but at a time in my life when I was ready for a new challenge. I was feeling very confident in other areas but to go from running a small company to running a venue was a big learning curve. One of the biggest challenges was learning the politics and context of it all, understanding the language of the arts and how institutions work here, while bringing in my own new ideas.</p> <p>The best thing is the genuine commitment that I've felt from local funders and council members \u2013 I've met people in Manchester City Council who care about culture in a very genuine way. The arts are really not valued in America in terms of public sector engagement, but in the UK, there is a sense that the arts are still a vital part of society, not just a commercial operation.</p> <p><strong>What could we do better in this country?</strong></p> <p>Something I try to work on is to get people thinking more entrepreneurially. To be artists first and foremost, but also to be developing some kind of business infrastructure, whether it's learning the skills or getting someone in who has those skills.</p> <p>In the UK, artists can be somewhat passive about their own careers, waiting for funding or not maximising an opportunity if it presents itself. Some don't have a website, business cards or a mailing list \u2013 the personal infrastructure that builds momentum. There are companies that are very savvy, and with others, I've tried to help develop those aspects. The only challenge is that they are now becoming tough negotiators \u2013 they are taking me to task over contracts!</p> <p><strong>What makes Contact such a successful venue?</strong></p> <p>Not underestimating young people, and treating everything we put on as a professional production with an expectation of, and commitment to, the highest quality production values. From hip-hop artists to Coney to young performers, we see everyone at the same level and invest in them.</p> <p><strong>Which is more important: nurturing young performers or young audiences?</strong></p> <p>Actually we do both: 65% of our audiences are under-35, which is very rare in theatre. There's a real sense that an audience member can become a participant and we really encourage performers to see other work \u2013 it's a fluid crossover. Over the past couple of years, we've also brought in a school audience.</p> <p>It's also the relationships that young people have with the building. We're very holistic with free drop-in workshops and there is always <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2011/nov/29/young-people-arts-organisations\" title=\"\">a core of young people involved in big decisions</a> \u2013 it all contributes to how we communicate both online and offline.</p> <p><strong>What kind of leader are you?</strong></p> <p>I think my strength is very much in my background as a performer. It means I can be a public speaker and represent \u2013 engaging on platforms or one-on-one to get the word out about Contact. My brief was really to build and develop relationships, maintaining our strength at a time when everything is getting cut and changed.</p> <p>One of the hardest things, also because of my background, is learning how to say no, while still being respectful and clear. You're going to upset and disappoint people and you can't keep everyone happy, so just try your best and continue to be an artist of integrity. That's why I've been directing <a href=\"http://thespace.org/items/e0000b0g\" title=\"\">Countryboy's Struggle</a> with the performer Maxwell Golden; the chair of my board was always asking: \"When are you going to make a show?\"</p> <p>When I took the Contact role, I wanted to put it out there that someone from the world of hip-hop could see themselves in this. It doesn't happen enough, that the people who do these top jobs come from some other world, some other community. I wanted to make it clear that people from a lot of different artistic backgrounds can step forward.</p> <p><em>Baba Israel is artistic director of </em><a href=\"http://contactmcr.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Contact, Manchester </em></a><em> \u2013 follow him on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BabaIsrael\" title=\"\"><em>@BabaIsrael</em></a><em> and follow Contact </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ContactMcr\" title=\"\"><em>@ContactMCR</em></a><em>. </em><a href=\"http://www.pleasance.co.uk/edinburgh/events/countryboys-struggle\" title=\"\"><em>Countryboy's Struggle</em></a><em> is at Pleasance, Edinburgh from 1-31 August</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>After a number of entertainingly unsuccessful relationships, Richard marries Sarah and they retreat from London to a country cottage in the Suffolk village of Worth. That name, with its layered meaning, gives a hint of the very particular comic style deployed in this novel. Richard and Sarah find themselves living next door to Catherine and a friendship develops, characterised by a series of delicate rebuffs and rapprochements. The agonies of being a neighbour haven't been so well anatomised since <em>The Good Life</em>. There are some lovely plot twists, but this is not a situation comedy so much as a grammatical one, the humour being wrung out of tightly wound sentences, drop by distilled drop. With an unusual degree of control, Canter seems somehow to have engineered the novel's action purely in order to deliver his impressive linguistic flourishes and set pieces. He can execute a verbal three-point turn in the tightest cul-de-sac of a sentence. It's skilful stuff and mesmerising to read. Funny, too.<strong> </strong></p>",
  "<p>Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawrence will earn around $10m (\u00a36.4m) for reprising her role in the sci-fi blockbuster's upcoming sequel, Catching Fire, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jennifer-lawrence-scores-10-million-hunger-games-sequel-358636\" title=\"\">according to the Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p> <p>Lawrence, who plays Katniss Everdeen in the big-screen adaptation of Suzanne Collins's bestselling young adult trilogy, is being rewarded by studio Lionsgate after the first film made a hugely impressive $683.8m at the global box office earlier this year. It has only just been surpassed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight Rises</a> as the second highest grossing film of 2012 so far.</p> <p>Lawrence was reportedly paid just $500,000 plus bonuses for her turn in The Hunger Games, but the studio recognises that an upgrade is necessary despite having already contracted the Oscar-nominated actor for four films. Co-stars Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth are getting far more meagre wage rises, suggesting that Lawrence is recognised as the franchise's key figure.</p> <p>Catching Fire starts shooting in September with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/141589/water-for-elephants\" title=\"\">Water for Elephants</a> director Francis Lawrence taking over from Gary Ross, a controversial shift fostered by the latter's refusal to adopt a time frame for the sequel which suited the studio's desire for a quick return to multiplexes. Lionsgate has also announced plans to shoot the final instalment in Collins's triptych, Mockingjay, as two separate movies.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Lawrence is not the only one cashing in on The Hunger Games' success. US store Target is to sell a replica 14-carat gold \"Mockingjay\" pin similar to the one worn by Everdeen in the film for a whopping $999. For those who cannot afford such prices, a replica of her leather hunting jacket will go on sale for just $349, or you can pick up a lithograph signed by 10 of the film's leading castmembers for $699. Only 100 of each sale item will be available to purchase.</p> <p>Earlier this week it was announced that US actor Lynn Cohen, best known for her role as Magda in the TV series Sex and the City, is <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lynn-cohen-catching-fire-hunger-games-357784\" title=\"\">to join the cast of Catching Fire as Mags</a>, an 80-year-old woman who finds herself returning to the Hunger Games arena after decades away.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkraCshPB4w\">\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again \u2026</a>\"</p> <p>Everyone who loves film knows the opening words of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iQIuQBzhP0\">Rebecca</a>, that astonishing mixture of emotional hothouse and freezer that was Hitchcock's first American film, made for David O Selznick and released in 1940. But for all the portent of that opening voiceover, or the symbolic drama of the great Cornish mansion burning down as the film ends, it's not about a place. It's not really a thriller, either, in any meaningful sense \u2013 despite the suspense of the closing reel.</p> <p>Rebecca is a film about abusive relationships, and the way power might shift within them \u2013 and, most unusually, even for its time \u2013 its hero is the worst of the abusers. The romantic might view <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/olivier\">Laurence Olivier</a>'s Max de Winter as someone haunted by his past; the realist would see him as someone haunted only by his inability to control his past, specifically his titular deceased wife, and so he alights upon Joan Fontaine's gauche, clumsy (and nameless) gentlewoman's companion as a wife who will give him no trouble.</p> <p>Briefly, Fontaine has accompanied the ghastly Mrs Van Hopper (Florence Bates) to Monte Carlo as her paid companion. There she meets de Winter, a dark and brooding widower, prone to staring moodily over cliff edges and contemplating death.</p> <p>After a whirlwind romance \u2013 much of which consists of him admonishing her in tones that would see any modern man dumped on the spot (his proposal: \"I'm asking you to marry me, you little fool\") \u2013 they marry and return to his ancestral home, where Rebecca's old personal maid, Mrs Danvers (Judith Anderson, portraying a <a href=\"http://terriermandotcom.blogspot.co.uk/2009/11/dogs-and-other-pets-on-bicycles-and.html\">Miss Gulch</a> of the servant class), makes the second Mrs de Winter's life a misery. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CU_8njaC1RE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CU_8njaC1RE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CU_8njaC1RE\">Reading on mobile? Watch here</a></p> <p>Everywhere she turns, Mrs Danvers summons the ghost of Rebecca, constant reminders of her own unsuitability for the role of ch\u00e2telain of Manderley. Only when Manderley is destroyed and the mystery of Rebecca's death \u2013 accident, or suicide, or murder \u2013 is solved, can Mr and Mrs de Winter, and Mrs Danvers, be freed. And like her mistress, the latter must die to be free. </p> <p>Rebecca was one of three films Hitchcock adapted from stories by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/daphnedumaurier\">Daphne du Maurier</a>, and much the most successful. Du Maurier had been distressed by the liberties he took with <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031505/\">Jamaica Inn</a>; <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056869/\">The Birds</a> suffered in being transformed from a perfect, ever-tightening noose of a short story set in Cornwall into an expansive movie set on the California coast. Rebecca's near fidelity is owed to Selznick, who was \"shocked and disappointed beyond words\" at Hitchcock's first treatment of the story and told the director: \"We bought Rebecca and we intend to make Rebecca.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/13Be_qo3Wxo?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/13Be_qo3Wxo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://youtu.be/13Be_qo3Wxo\">Reading on mobile? Watch here</a></p> <p>The only significant departure from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/classics/9781844080380/rebecca\">the novel </a>was unavoidable. Du Maurier made Max de Winter a murderer: he killed Rebecca in rage at her affairs (feminist readings of the story posit her as its heroine; any modern reader will view her sympathetically the more they see of her husband). The Hollywood Production Code, however, could not allow a murderer to escape unpunished and so an accidental death had to be engineered. Clumsy it might have been, but because that plotline is tacked on at the end, it doesn't interfere with the mighty central pillar of the film: the desperate, suffocating, co-dependent relationships of Mr and Mrs de Winter, Mrs Danvers and Rebecca.</p> <p>Reliant though the film is on dialogue, Hitchcock throws in those inimitable visual touches, too: Max staring over the cliffs to the Mediterranean, the sea swirling sickeningly beneath him, showing us his death wish; his sister explaining to the second Mrs de Winter how much Mrs Danvers loved Rebecca, and the screen fading to black behind Fontaine's face, a startling representation of the fall in your stomach when you hear something you have dreaded. And, of course, that critical, crippling moment when Fontaine descends the grand staircase to the Manderley masquerade ball, having been tricked by Mrs Danvers into wearing a replica of one of Rebecca's old gowns.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yZsDV_evon8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yZsDV_evon8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yZsDV_evon8\">Reading on mobile? Watch here</a></p> <p>It's Fontaine's film, really, rather than Olivier's. He supplies the danger (though in the novel, the fact that Mrs de Winter conspires to conceal Rebecca's murder shows how she has been corrupted by her awful marriage), and she is our representative: the one who shows how we might fare transplanted into minor aristocracy. She's obviously too beautiful to be the mousy, dowdy wallflower the character demands, but by hunching her shoulders and darting her eyes, by playing up the clumsiness and never acknowledging her own beauty, she convinces. She has to: for without her, this would be only a film about vile snobs.</p> <p>The reason Rebecca still grips lies in the fact that we can all see ourselves in Fontaine's role: everyone plunged into a new and unfamiliar milieu has felt her uncertainty and fear that they are the wrong person, in the wrong place. We have all had relationships in which we cannot be sure where the ground lies, in which the dynamics of power leave us isolated and clinging desperately to whatever fixed points we can find.</p> <p>\"Our marriage is a success, isn't it? A great success? We're happy, aren't we? Terribly happy?\" Fontaine asks Olivier halfway through the film. He turns and strolls away from her. She continues, the note of desperate hope gone from her voice. \"If you don't think we are happy, it would be much better if you didn't pretend.\" By now she's almost whispering. \"I'll go away. Why won't you answer me?\" And there, in those few seconds of speech, is the most human, heartbreakingly vulnerable person ever to appear in a Hitchcock film.</p>",
  "<p>I have deliberately waited 24 hours before commenting on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/aug/06/mirror-group-digital-matt-kelly\">the departure of Matt Kelly as Mirror group digital publisher.</a></p> <p>I am sure Trinity Mirror's executives were anticipating that I would use the event to repeat my consistent criticisms of the publisher's inadequacy.</p> <p>So I stayed my hand overnight in order to avoid a knee-jerk response. It also enabled me to canvass some insider opinions.</p> <p>But nothing I have heard has changed my thinking. Kelly's going is part of a pattern, confirming that a company that publishes newspapers and news websites has no respect for journalism... and certainly none for journalists.</p> <p>Trinity Mirror, while paying lip service to the need for online innovation, has failed to invest in digital journalism with anything like the necessary nous and enthusiasm.</p> <p>For example, one of Kelly's main projects - <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/\">MirrorFootball.co.uk</a> - contained all the ingredients that could, and should, have made it the most successful sporting website in the UK.</p> <p>It was a good idea. It had a terrific archive. It built an audience, but it hasn't done anything like as well as it should have done because it required targeted investment in resources. The team was too small. There were too few journalists and an obvious lack of digital developers to make the site dynamic enough. There has been a lack of intelligent support.</p> <p>As so often with TM, there was also precious little marketing and promotion involved. Penny-pinching may make for good business. But national newspapers cannot be run in that fashion. They are businesses like no other. TM has never grasped this uncomfortable truth.</p> <p>Most importantly, the company has not grasped that journalists tend to be idiosyncratic and often troublesome individuals. They are not \"units\". Their skills and enthusiasm are invaluable.</p> <p>Indeed, the small teams dedicated to producing both the print paper and the website prove the point. That they manage to produce what they do is a small miracle. But more journalists are required.</p> <p>I cannot understand why the relatively new chairman, David Grigson, hasn't perceived that fact. Though he is a chartered accountant, he has worked in the past at EMAP and Reuters. So he surely knows that journalistic excellence is key to the company's success. It is, if you like, the main \"product\".</p> <p>The departure of Sly Bailey and arrival of Grigson was viewed by staff as offering a glimmer of hope. Instead, talent has been bleeding away in recent months. Grigson hasn't got a grip. There is no strategy for growth, merely a set of insufficient and derisory decisions enabling the publisher to tread water.</p> <p>The firing of Daily Mirror editor Richard Wallace and Sunday Mirror editor Tina Weaver in order to introduce seven-day publication need not have happened if they and the management had been singing from the same hymn sheet.</p> <p>But they were not, of course. Wallace and Weaver too often found themselves completely opposed to management's cost-cutting decisions. They understood the business logic, but the cuts occurred too often and were too deep.</p> <p>In a sense, Kelly's departure after 18 years with the company is of a similar order. Doubtless he will be snapped up elsewhere. Having joint journalistic and digital skills is a great calling card nowadays.</p> <p>Meanwhile, TM still has no chief executive. This will be a crucial appointment. Will it be a number-cruncher (such as the stand-in Vijay Vaghela, the finance director)? Will it be a digital airhead (such as Johnston Press's CEO, Ashley Highfield)? Or will it be someone from an editorial background but with commercial experience?</p> <p>The last would be best, though there are few around nowadays. Almost all newspaper managements have gradually evacuated journalists from their boards.</p> <p>But without someone at the Trinity Mirror helm who understands the primacy of journalism, the papers will go on declining at an even faster rate than they are currently.</p>",

The 60-year-old didn't want to die. He wanted the ventilator to stay on. He was determined to walk out of the intensive care unit and he wanted everyone to know it.</p> <p>But Marsh couldn't tell anyone that. The medics believed he was in a persistent vegetative state, devoid of mental consciousness or physical feeling.</p> <p>Nothing could have been further from the truth. Marsh was aware, alert and fully able to feel every touch to his body.</p> <p>\"I had full cognitive and physical awareness,\" he said. \"But an almost complete paralysis of nearly all the voluntary muscles in my body.\"</p> <p>The first sign that Marsh was recovering was with twitching in his fingers which spread through his hand and arm. He describes the feeling of accomplishment at being able to scratch his own nose again. But it's still a mystery as to why he recovered when the vast majority of locked-in syndrome victims do not.</p> <p>\"They don't know why I recovered because they don't know why I had locked-in in the first place or what really to do about it. Lots of the doctors and medical experts I saw didn't even know what locked-in was. If they did know anything, it was usually because they'd had a paragraph about it during their medical training. No one really knew anything.\"</p> <p>Marsh has never spoken publicly about his experience before. But in an exclusive interview with the Guardian, he gave a rare and detailed insight into what it is like to be \"locked in\".</p> <p>\"All I could do when I woke up in ICU was blink my eyes,\" he remembered. \"I was on life support with a breathing machine, with tubes and wires on every part of my body, and a breathing tube down my throat. I was in a severe locked in-state for some time. Things looked pretty dire.</p> <p>\"My brain protected me \u2013 it didn't let me grasp the seriousness of the situation. It's weird but I can remember never feeling scared. I knew my cognitive abilities were 100%. I could think and hear and listen to people but couldn't speak or move. The doctors would just stand at the foot of the bed and just talk like I wasn't in the room. I just wanted to holler: 'Hey people, I'm still here!' But there was no way to let anyone know.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vegetative-state/pages/diagnosis.aspx\" title=\"\">Locked-in syndrome</a> affects around 1% of people who have as stroke. It is a condition for which there is no treatment or cure, and it is extremely rare for patients to recover any significant motor functions. About 90% die within four months of its onset.</p> <p>Marsh had his stroke on 20 May 2009. Astonishingly, four months and nine days later, he walked out of his long-term care facility. Today, he has recovered 95% of his functionality; he goes to the gym every day, cooks meals for his family and last month, he bought a bicycle, which he rides around Napa Valley, California, where he lives.</p> <p>But he still weeps when he remembers watching his wife tell the doctors that they couldn't turn off his life support machine.</p> <p>\"The doctors had just finished telling Lili that I had a 2% chance of survival and if I should survive I would be a vegetable,\" he said. \"I could hear the conversation and in my mind I was screaming 'No!'\"</p> <p>Locked-in syndrome is less unknown than it once was. The success of the 2007 film, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/feb/08/worldcinema.drama\" title=\"\">The Diving Bell and the Butterfly</a>, the autobiography of the former editor of French Elle magazine editor, Jean-Dominique Bauby, brought awareness of the condition to the general public for the first time.</p> <p>Then in June, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jun/23/tony-nicklinson-assisted-suicide-twitter-interview\" title=\"\">Tony Nicklinson</a> challenged the law on assisted dying in England and Wales at the High Court as part of his battle to allow a doctor to end a life he said was \"miserable, demeaning and undignified\". Judgment was reserved until the Autumn.</p> <p>Marsh, however, did something almost unheard of: he recovered. On the third day after his stroke, a doctor peered down at him and uttered the longed-for words: \"You know, I think he might still be there. Let's see.\"</p> <p>The moment that doctor discovered Marsh could communicate through blinking was one of profound relief for Marsh and his family \u2013 although his prognosis remained critical.</p> <p>\"You're at the mercy of other people to care for your every need and that's incredibly frustrating, but I never lost my alertness,\" he said. \"I was completely aware of everything going on around me and to me right from the very start, unless when they had me medicated,\" he said.</p> <p>\"During the day, I was really lucky: I never spent a single day when my wife or one of my kids wasn't there. But once they left, it was lonely \u2013 not in the way of missing people but the loneliess of knowing there's no one there who really understands how to communicate with you.\"</p> <p>The only way for Marsh to sleep, was to be medicated. That, however, only lasted four hours, after which there had to be a three-hour pause before the next dose could be administered.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/blog/2012/jul/30/richard-marsh-lockedin-syndrome\" title=\"\">In questions submitted by Guardian readers to Marsh ahead of this interview one asked about his experience of his hospital care while the staff did not think he was conscious.</a> Marsh said: \"The staff who work at night were the newest and least skilled, and I was totally at their mercy. I felt very vulnerable. I did get injured a couple of times with rough handling and that always happened at night. I knew I wasn't in the best of care and I just counted the minutes until I would get more medicine and just sleep.</p> <p>In response to another question, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/blog/2012/jul/30/richard-marsh-lockedin-syndrome?commentpage=1#comment-17419896\" title=\"\">about the right-to-die debate, </a>Marsh said he has no opinion. All he will say is: \"I understand the despair and how a person would reach that point.\" But he is co-writing a book that he hopes will inspire hope and provide information to victims of locked-in syndrome and their families.</p> <p>\"When they first told my family that I was probably locked-in, they tried to find information on the internet \u2013 but there wasn't any. One of my goals now is to change that \u2026 to be able to reach out to families who find themselves in the same situation that mine were in so they can help their loved ones.</p> <p>\"Time goes by so slow ... It just drags by. I don't know how to describe it. It's almost like it stands still.</p> <p>\"It's a terrible, terrible place to be but there's always hope,\" he added. \"You've got to have hope.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 10 August 2012. The original said that Tony Nicklinson had failed in his High court bid to change the law on assisted dying in England and Wales. This has been corrected.</p>",

In the hours before his race at London 2012, one commentary published in China Daily said: \"The nation has been waiting four years to hear the Olympic starting gun for the star hurdler Liu Xiang.\"</p> <p>However, now 29, Liu, had arrived at the Olympics amid speculation that he was carrying injuries, despite showing some impressive form in elite events this year. Liu's coach had expressed concern about his recurrent foot injury in the last few days in widely reported remarks, leading many to conclude his prospects of reclaiming his title were poor.</p> <p>Wearing heavy strapping on his right achilles, Liu rose from the blocks in his opening heat, but hit his first hurdle and fell to the ground. He stood up and hopped on his left leg back towards the start, then turned around and tottered all the way down the straight.</p> <p>Some of the commentators on Chinese state television were unable to control their tears. The subject immediately dominated domestic microblogs, with around 20m mentions of a \"Liu crashed\" hashtag within half an hour of his tumble. \"Liu fell to the ground.

Some dubbed him \"Liu Shuai Shuai\" (\"Liu Fell Fell\") and spoke harshly of his failure.</p> <p>One cynical microblogger wrote: \"Liu is the best actor in the world.\" But most showed their sympathy, with one user writing: \"Anyway, you were already the champion when you made it to the field.\" Another scolded the critics, writing: \"Maybe there is a low point for everyone.

So Murder One is something I finally saw, in box set form, about two years ago, and it is utterly brilliant. What the hell was I thinking, studying when this was on? One crime, one defendant, one law firm, and best of all, one Teddy Hoffman, played with theatrical conviction by the excellent Daniel Benzali.

But before she was the Queen, she was Jane Tennison, a genuinely groundbreaking TV detective. Tennison's personal life is messy, but her doggedness, her passion, and her inability to give a toss about petty office politics override everything else. She faces down sexism and police hierarchy in her relentless pursuit of the truth. The grittiness of the cases and the calibre of the actors (in addition to Mirren, the first episode alone featured Zoe Wanamaker, Tom Wilkinson and Ralph Fiennes) raises this show above its many pretenders.</p> <h2>Danger Mouse</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pjw2JshcIT4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pjw2JshcIT4?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>I most certainly did say Danger Mouse.

  "<p>Music apps and children's apps are two of the most creative and innovative categories in modern-day app stores, but also two of the hardest to make money from. It's a brave company that looks to make its fortune from music apps for kids, then.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.gabuduck.com/\">Gabuduck</a> is that company. The Las Vegas-based developer's first two iPad apps were released in July 2012: storybook <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/miko-and-cola/id537748482?mt=8\">Miko and Cola</a>, and <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/kbc-kids-kid-friendly-hip-hop!/id540244798?mt=8\">KBC Kids \u2013 Kid Friendly Hip Hop</a>.</p> <p>Both include music-making as key features, with children tapping characters and items in on-screen scenes to trigger samples and loops. Gabuduck used a technology called Art Jam from another startup, <a href=\"http://www.moonrider.com/\">Moonrider</a>, to make this happen.</p> <p>The company was co-founded by chief executive Angela Abshier, a \"recovering IP lawyer\" with a music industry background, and partner John McClain, an Emmy and Grammy-winning sound designer.</p> <p>\"Music is central: we are working with as many musicians as possible and relying largely on the marketing power of some of the personalities we are using,\" says Abshier.</p> <p>\"Every musician to have a child wants to be in this space. We are using them as voice talent, licensing existing tracks and commissioning new works.\"</p> <p>Gabuduck customised Art Jam's interface after meeting its developer in January at the CES show, but it's also working on its own \"kid-friendly mixing studio\" for future apps.</p> <p>The company is already working on its next app, Go Go Greta, a storybook app that involves two music artists. Lisa Loeb is providing the voice narration, while the theme song will come from a band called Happy Racers.</p> <p>Loeb is also on board for an app called Jenny Jenkins, where she'll take the form of a guitar-playing cat. \"We've created these amazing music homages,\" says Abshier. \"Black sounds like Johnny Cash, and yellow sounds like The Beatles\u2026\"</p> <p>Gabuduck is hoping to create new revenue streams for artists at a time when many are looking beyond their traditional live and recordings income. The company is also ambitious beyond this.</p> <p>\"We would love to have a music subscription service,\" says Abshier. \"If ArtJam connects and people love it, we will absolutely put it all in one place and charge a small monthly fee, and constantly update.\"</p> <p>Like other companies making apps for children, especially new startups, Gabuduck needs to build trust with parents. Abshier says the company has decided that \"there will never be ads in our apps\", although it is using in-app purchases.</p> <p>So, KBC Kids costs \u00a31.99 and includes two songs to play with, then charges 69p for a third, with more to come. Miko and Cola also costs \u00a31.99, which includes its storybook element, then charges 69p for the ArtJam songs.</p> <p>\"We have worked hard to create proprietary parental controls: when you buy a Gabuduck app, it is delivered in a locked state,\" says Abshier.</p> <p>\"For us its about the consumer, and we have two: the parent and the child. We want parents to trust us and kids to be delighted by what we create\u2026 Our apps are expensive to produce. We will always charge premium prices but we believe that you get what you pay for.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Burmese authorities have lifted suspensions on two weekly magazines after journalists staged a rare protest to demand greater press freedom.</p> <p>The editors of The Voice Weekly and Envoy were summoned by the country's media censorship bureau, known as the Press Scrutiny Board, and informed them they could resume publishing from 18 August.</p> <p>A week ago the editors were ordered to suspend publication indefinitely for having violated unspecified regulations.

  "<p>I enjoyed my afternoon at the Olympics, sitting in my public lottery-assigned \u00a350 seat at the ExCel, with a fine view of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012-boxing\" title=\"\">men's boxing</a>. And I enjoyed it not least because I was finally able to watch the sport itself without the surrounding hype, the layers of commentary. For a moment there was only that pleasure special to sport: the spontaneity of a story being fashioned in front of your own eyes, once and once only (despite digital repeats), robustly itself and not pretending to be anything else.</p> <p>As a lover and student of sport for many decades, I don't need to be reminded how compelling sport can be. But I've also learned what sport is not and that overstating or misstating its importance does it no favours.</p> <p>As one, the media are cajoling us into appropriate displays of Olympic enthusiasm, particularly in relation to British victories. Breathless BBC commentators reiterate the same round of superlatives \u2013 \"unbelievable\", \"incredible\", \"amazing,\" \"brilliant,\" \"unbelievable\" \u2013 telling us again and again how unique, how special, how extraordinary these Olympics are. It feels like they're the ones on performance-enhancing drugs, not the usually sober, poised and realistic competitors.</p> <p>Sadly, at the ExCel, after the refreshment of the boxing came the utterly formulaic torpor of a video package in which celebrities waxed banal on the \"atmosphere\" that makes the Olympics special and the \"unforgettable\" moment we're privileged to be part of. Sorry, but generally I prefer to decide for myself \u2013 or let time decide \u2013 if something I've witnessed is unforgettable. Olympic competitions, like other sports competitions, as any sports fan knows, are not an uninterrupted succession of climactic highs. The boring and the (relatively) mediocre play a necessary role.</p> <p>Commentators and politicians rush to squeeze Olympic results into preferred narratives and to draw apposite moral lessons. These lessons are invariably platitudes that tell us little about either sport or the outside world. It's as if there's a fear of letting us exercise our own powers of interpretation.</p> <p>The paradox is that at the core of the micro-managed Olympic spectacle is a phenomenon whose essence is its unpredictability, its uncontrollability, its sublime indifference to all extraneous narratives. Sport, even encased in the Olympic armour, retains an autonomy; each competition operates under impersonal self-contained laws. Unlike art, or the opening ceremony, sport cannot be orchestrated. Indeed, that's a condition of its legitimacy. It does not unfold according to a preconceived scenario, or illustrate a preconceived \"lesson\". Once the gun is fired or the clock starts, competitors are subject only to the egalitarian law of the level playing field, something otherwise conspicuously absent in our world. This is why we celebrate a Jesse Owens, an Abebe Bikila, a Cathy Freeman \u2013 because they used the level playing field to overturn (for a moment) historical hierarchies.</p> <p>The Olympic hype has helped me understand an observation made by the philosopher <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/jul/15/slavoj-zizek-interview-life-writing\" title=\"\">Slavoj \u017di\u017eek</a>. Under the old regime, he says, the command was \"Thou shalt not\", whereas under the new it's \"Thou shalt\" \u2013 a ceaseless injunction to enjoy, consume, spend, celebrate. Or as Olympic sponsor Nike says, \"Just do it\". All of which is in its own way as oppressive and self-distorting as the old prohibitions.</p> <p>I've been an Olympics follower since the Tokyo games of 1964 but I perfectly understand that many people do not share my interest, and there is no civic requirement for them to do so. The Olympic boosterism treats competitive sport as something it is not and never should be \u2013 mandatory. To be itself, sport needs to be a freedom exercised, an option not an obligation. The injunction to \"stop moaning\" or \"whingeing\" should be roundly rejected, not least by genuine sports fans. The issues raised by the Olympics are not trivial: security in the context of the war on terror and the erosion of civil liberties; outsourcing and privatisation; the global ethics of giant corporations; the colonisation of the public realm through the super-enforcement of intellectual property rights; the subordination of local needs to the imperatives of global capital. These are not peripheral questions that can be wished away, and the success or failure of British competitors or of \"London 2012\" as a one-off event will have no bearing on any of them.</p> <p>Sport does offer a kind of escape, an alternative, exterior focus (like Shakespeare, a Twilight movie, or a game show). But it is not a vacation from critical thought. I find no difficulty thoroughly enjoying the best of the competition without compromising for a moment a necessarily critical perspective on what the Olympic enterprise has become.</p> <p>\u2022 A longer version of this article can be found at <a href=\"http://www.mikemarqusee.com/\" title=\"\">mikemarqusee.com</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>You are widely credited as the architect of welfare reform. Why is it so important to change the system?</strong></p> <p>Currently the benefit system is not only complex to navigate, but it is also difficult to run. It acts as a disincentive to work as it creates uncertainty for those thinking about taking the leap back into employment. It also makes people very risk averse and hinders them from breaking welfare dependency.</p> <p>The new universal credit system will support people back into work and take away the risk of starting employment by ensuring that people know that they are better off in work. It will also help people to feel more in control as they will have a clearer understanding of what is expected of them and what they will receive in return. Having a clear benefits system will have a remarkable impact on the social life and health of the country.</p> <p><strong>Welfare reform has received a mixed reception from professionals tasked with delivering it. How do you respond to their concerns?</strong></p> <p>Any change can cause uncertainty, but that is why my department is looking closely at each and every part of the reforms to ensure that what is being rolled out is viable. Parts of the housing industry have raised concerns about cash flow. I am committed to ensuring that we do not undermine the social landlord sector, but we must allow people to run their lives independently.&#xa0;</p> <p>We are running demonstration projects in six locations that are designed to pick up any issues that arise from paying housing benefit directly to tenants and to deal with these before universal credit begins its full rollout in October 2013.</p> <p><strong>How will you ensure that the right leadership is in place as the reforms come through?</strong></p> <p>Work is ongoing to ensure that housing and local government leaders are with us, designing how these reforms will be rolled out, and how they will impact upon people in their day-to-day lives. Local authority-led pilots will be up and running in the autumn. These will provide a unique opportunity for councils to shape the development of universal credit.</p> <p>Councils have a strong understanding of local job markets and the needs of their residents, so there can be no doubt that they will have a central role in providing face-to-face assistance and advice in the new welfare system. I am encouraged to see local authorities taking the lead in ensuring that local people are supported as the reforms move forward.</p> <p><strong>The majority of </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2012/mar/30/cost-of-housing-benefit-grows-working-households\" title=\"\"><strong>new housing benefit claimants are already in work</strong></a><strong>, but are often paid below a living wage for their area. How does the DWP plan to tackle low pay, as it attempts to move families off benefits and back into the economy?</strong></p> <p>Universal credit is intended to ensure that people are always better off in work and will directly help people back into work. People on low incomes, under the credit, will be able to increase their hours without the fear or uncertainty of leaving the benefits system, only to be forced to wait for an extended amount of time to have their benefits reinstated if their employment doesn't work out.</p> <p>The intention is that any work pays, and in particular, low-hours work. Where people on low incomes cannot increase their hours for legitimate reasons they will continue to be supported by the welfare system.</p> <p><strong>What else can the housing sector do to make sure the tenants that it supports have the best opportunity to get off benefits and into work?</strong></p> <p>Many social landlords already work closely with their tenants on a range of issues. Helping people to find employment and reduce benefit dependency is not only good for tenants themselves but for whole communities, and landlords are in a unique position to help.</p> <p>Landlords have a close relationship with their tenants that many branches of government don't. This means they can use their local knowledge and expertise to support people.</p> <p><strong>You have some very outspoken critics in the housing and charity world. Is there anything you'd do differently if you had a chance to work on welfare reform again?</strong></p> <p>Throughout the process of welfare reform, from taking the Welfare Reform Act through parliament to the detailed implementation we are now working on, we have worked with groups to make sure we get it right. This is continuing as we bring forward the universal credit regulations. From day one we came in with a plan to deliver universal credit and have set ourselves a very clear timetable. But we have learned lessons along the way, and the smart way we are implementing universal credit over four years means we can continue to learn lessons.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for news, views and the </strong><a href=\"http://housingjobs.theguardian.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>latest job vacancies</strong></a><strong> direct to you</strong></p>",

  "<p>More than \u00a311.5bn has been wiped from the stock market value of Standard Chartered bank since <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/06/standard-chartered-iran-transactions\" title=\"\">US allegations that the bank had illegally moved $250bn of Iranian money around the financial system</a>.</p> <p>The share price fall on Tuesday puts the top management of the bank \u2013 described by the US authorities as a \"rogue institution\" \u2013 under intense pressure even though they have denied the allegations made by the US.</p> <p>By midday Tuesday in London the shares had lost \u00a34.81 of their value \u2013 some \u00a311.5bn in total \u2013 since the shock announcement which caused the sudden 6% fall in the shares on Monday and a further 24% fall on Tuesday.</p> <p>The stunning drop comes after the surprise announcement, just as the London market was closing on Monday, by the New York state department of financial services that Standard Chartered's actions had left the US \"vulnerable to terrorists, weapon dealers, drug kings and corrupt regimes\".</p> <p>Even though the highly regarded London-based bank <a href=\"http://www.standardchartered.com/en/news-and-media/news/global/2012-08-06-response-to-NY-State-Department-comments.html\" title=\"\">denied the accusations</a>, investors took fright following a spate of banking scandals that have unseated management at rival banks and amid fears Standard Chartered could lose its banking license in the US.</p> <p>Standard Chartered had attempted to calm nerves overnight by issuing a statement at midnight refuting the allegations.</p> <p>Until now, the bank has been the only global bank regarded as having a reputation untarnished by the growing number of scandals. Top management was stunned by the scale of the allegations, of which it had no prior warning before late Monday afternoon.</p> <p>The US regulator's 30-page report reproduces emails and conversations between Standard Chartered staff, including a remark from a London-based director when warned by a US colleague of potential problems in dealing with Iran. \"You fucking Americans. Who are you to tell us, the rest of the world, that we're not going to deal with Iranians,\" the director said.</p> <p>The director is not named but the exchange is said to have taken place when the bank's chief executive for America warns, among others, the head group executive director for risk. At the time, October 2006, this title was held by Richard Meddings, who was promoted to finance director the following month. The bank would not comment on individuals.</p> <p>Meddings and Peter Sands, who was promoted from finance director to chief executive in November 2006, are highly regarded and respectively regarded as potential candidates for top jobs at Barclays and as the next governor of the Bank of England.</p> <p>Until November 2006 Mervyn Davies had been chief executive \u2013 a role he held since 2001 \u2013 until he was elevated to chairman. He later became Lord Davies when he joined the Labour government during the financial crisis and left the bank. Among others to have sat on the board are Lord Turner, who was a non-executive director for two years until he left in late 2008 to become chairman of the Financial Services Authority.</p> <p>While the US authorities said that $250bn had been hidden for nearly a decade, Standard Chartered conceded that \"under $14m\" had breached so-called U-turns, which were transactions that US authorities allowed to take place as long as the money did not end up in Iranian banks. The bank stopped dealing with Iran five years ago.</p> <p>\"As we have disclosed to the authorities, well over 99.9% of the transactions relating to Iran complied with the U-turn regulations. The total value of transactions which did not follow the U-turn was under $14m,\" Standard Chartered said.</p> <p>In 2010, 2011 and only last week when it published another rise in profits, the bank has admitted it was in discussions with US regulators about historic breaches of sanctions.</p> <p>But it appears to have been wrong footed by the New York regulator, which it had expected to co-ordinate with other US agencies. Standard Chartered is also in discussions with the department of justice, the office of foreign assets control, the Federal Reserve group of New York and the district attorney of New York.</p> <p>Standard Chartered said it had \"voluntarily approached all relevant US agencies\" in January 2010 and \"informed them that we had initiated a review of historical US dollar transactions and their compliance with US sanctions\".</p> <p>\"This review focused primarily on transactions relating to Iran in the period 2001-2007, and in particular, their compliance with the U-turn framework established by the US authorities to enable ongoing US dollar trade with Iran by other countries.\"</p> <p>Several thousands of pages of documents and interview notes, plus analysis of approximately 150m payment messages were handed over. The New York regulator accuses Standard Chartered of hiding the transactions by wiping out codes used in the payment system that would have identified Iranian clients.</p> <p>\"The group does not believe the order issued \u2026 presents a full and accurate picture of the facts. The analysis, that the group shared with all the US agencies, demonstrates that throughout the period the group acted to comply, and overwhelmingly did comply, with US sanctions and the regulations relating to U-turn payments,\" said the bank.</p> <p>Its review of its Iranian payments also did not identify a single payment on behalf of any party that was designated at the time by the US government as a terrorist entity or organisation,\" it said.</p> <p>\"The group takes its responsibilities very seriously, and seeks to comply at all times with the relevant laws and regulations. It is in this spirit we initiated this review and have engaged with the US agencies,\" the bank said.</p>",
  "<p>Preparing to host the 2012 Olympic Games presented a whole range of challenges for London: the transport system, ticketing arrangements, even the thorny topic of bin collection. One issue that has been largely absent though is what child protection arrangements would be in place during the Games.</p> <p>Why would the Olympics have any particular impact on the day to day running of child protection services in the city? Is this something that London even needs to worry about? Since no one else seemed to be asking these questions, the <a href=\"http://www.londonscb.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">London Safeguarding Children Board</a> formed a new Safe Games for Children subgroup back in 2010 to do just that.</p> <p>Initially set up as a forum for the Olympic host boroughs to discuss and co-ordinate their own local arrangements, it soon became apparent that a large number of organisations were already looking at these issues and were keen to join up and share their expertise. Before long, the subgroup had expanded to include a huge number of voluntary and statutory groups, all looking to work together more closely and make sure the protection of children remained high on the agenda.</p> <p>The major problem facing the group was that London had never held an event of this scale before, and no recent host city (for the Olympics or any other major sporting event) had attempted to record the level of general child protection activity during their event.</p> <p>We had our own thoughts on the key concerns, from a possible increase in domestic violence to fears that vulnerable teenagers may be drawn to London with subsequent risks from increased gang activity, youth crime or alcohol and drug misuse. But with nothing but anecdotal evidence to work with, the major issue for the group was how to ensure that services were prepared to cope with any increased demand.</p> <p>Training leads from eight local safeguarding children boards joined up with representatives from the police, the <a href=\"http://www.redcross.org.uk/\" title=\"\">British Red Cross</a> and seven voluntary sector organisations to develop a comprehensive training pack for volunteers at the Games. Delivered free of charge to training leads from a whole host of organisations, over 400 people attended these sessions and departed ready to train up their own teams of volunteers.</p> <p>The next step was to make sure that London's child protection teams were ready to cope with any increased demand that might arise during Games time, while continuing to deliver their usual functions for local children. This work focussed particularly on the huge Olympic park site and surrounding area, known as the \"Olympic co-ordination zone\", spanning four local authority areas.</p> <p>With no borough given overall control for the zone, safeguarding leads from Hackney, Newham, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest led the development of a unique arrangement to share child protection responsibility for this area, working closely with the police and Olympics organisers to develop a single point of contact telephone number for referrals from the zone.</p> <p>This number is rotated between the four boroughs every few days throughout the Games, with each local authority having capacity to boost its usual social work and out of hours capacity during its time on rota to help ensure a swift and high quality response for any children who do need safeguarding during the Games.</p> <p>In support of this work, all 33 London children's services teams agreed to provide a named contact to take any onward referrals from the zone and all agreed to take immediate responsibility for children from their local authority area to ease the burden on the four boroughs.</p> <p>Perhaps most impressively, every single London borough also agreed to join a rota and share responsibility for providing safe accommodation to any children who couldn't be returned home immediately (including trafficked children), a commitment which could potentially carry significant resource implications.</p> <p>Whatever impact the Olympics does have on child protection services in London, the support and commitment we have secured from across the capital has been outstanding. Entirely led and resourced by local authorities and their partners, the response we have developed leaves London well placed to deal with whatever challenges arise.</p> <p><em>Ian Dean is manager of the London Safeguarding Children Board.</em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2012/jul/16/become-member-guardian-social-care-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the social care network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",

  "<p>Development conferences are smart-suited affairs these days. At the recent <a href=\"http://www.uncsd2012.org/\" title=\"\">Earth summit in Rio</a>, dozens of chief executives jetted in to voice their thoughts and <a href=\"http://www.unglobalcompact.org/NewsAndEvents/rio_2012/index.html\" title=\"\">\"showcase\" their commitments to sustainability</a>. Twenty years ago, corporate representatives were almost entirely absent.</p> <p>In a curious twist of roles, it was business leaders \u2013 not policymakers \u2013 who trumpeted progressive ideas like <a href=\"http://www.naturalcapitaldeclaration.org/\" title=\"\">\"natural capital\"</a>, <a href=\"http://www.unido.org/index.php?id=1002609\" title=\"\">\"green industry\"</a>, <a href=\"http://www.aviva.com/corporate-responsibility/programme-updates/13023/\" title=\"\">mandatory sustainability reporting</a>, and so on. Last week's appointment of Unilever CEO Paul Polman to a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/aug/01/panel-lead-global-development-agenda-named?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">high-level UN panel</a> signals a formal acceptance of corporations in the development debate.</p> <p>The UN has been reaching out to business for some time. Its flagship set of business principles, the <a href=\"http://www.unglobalcompact.org/\" title=\"\">UN Global Compact</a>, now has 6,000 company signatories. Companies have deep pockets, knowhow and technical capacity \u2013 assets aid agencies frequently lack \u2013 so it makes rational sense for the UN to embrace the private sector.</p> <p>But should the development community be concerned about businesses sharing their patch? First, some perspective. This isn't a Wall Street invasion. Polman is the only corporate boss on the 26-member panel. In fact, most come from the same cadre of summit-weary diplomatic types who so unsurprisingly failed at the Earth summit. UK prime minister <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jun/12/david-cameron-rio20-earth-summit\" title=\"\">David Cameron, who didn't even manage to attend the Rio jamboree</a>, is co-chair.</p> <p>Then there's Polman himself. Most chief execs can spout the \"sustainable business\" chat these days, but along with Puma's Jochen Zeitz and Kingfisher's Ian Cheshire, Netherlands-born Polman is one of the few who genuinely knows his stuff. Nor is he afraid to stick his neck out. He's previously urged governments to impose a <a href=\"http://www.unilever.com/mediacentre/pressreleases/2009/Unilevercallsformoratoriumondeforestationoftropicalrainforest.aspx\" title=\"\">moratorium on the deforestation of tropical forests</a>, and to make sustainable reporting mandatory. He is also on record as telling Unilever shareholders not on board with his sustainability objectives to \"get out\".</p> <p>Even so, the idea of business meddling in development still discomfits many. After all, large, publicly-owned corporations are unapologetically profit-driven; they're about making money and increasing dividends, not reducing poverty. Nonetheless, if meeting development needs can help the bottom line, companies have every reason to get involved.</p> <p>Unilever is an arch proponent of the so-called <a href=\"http://www.unilever.co.uk/sustainable-living/ourapproach/oursustainabilitystrategy/\" title=\"\">\"business case\" for development</a>. On the supply side, it sources thousands of tons of agricultural raw materials every year, much of which comes from African and other developing countries. If farmers can't make a viable living, then supplies of sugar, soy, tea and so forth will dwindle and Unilever's procurement bill will spike.</p> <p>Other companies understand this, too. <a href=\"http://www.mars.com/global/brands/cocoa-sustainability/mars-and-cocoa-sustainability.aspx\" title=\"\">US confectionery giant Mars</a> works with cocoa farmers in the Ivory Coast and Ghana to improve their skills and increase their incomes. It pitches its Vision for Change programme as a corporate responsibility project. Far more importantly, however, it's a way of keeping Snickers bars on the shelves.</p> <p>Similarly significant is the demand side. Consumer goods firms need customers. Two billion times a day, someone, somewhere uses a Unilever product. The company needs to increase that figure if it's to double its business by 2020 under its <a href=\"http://www.unilever.com/sustainable-living/\" title=\"\">sustainable living plan</a>. Turning the world's poor into consumers is a logical way to achieve that. In rural India, <a href=\"http://www.hul.co.in/careers-redesign/insidehul/oursuccessandchallenges/shaktiprogrammeindia.aspx\" title=\"\">Unilever is marketing its shampoos and washing powders in affordable, sachet-sized units</a>. It presents this exercise as responsible business, since getting soap into the hands of the poor is shown to cut disease.</p> <p>The development community is right to be wary, however. Just because there's a business case for development doesn't necessarily mean there is a development case for business. For starters, the business case isn't flawless. When companies talk of the <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/1746818/fortune-bottom-pyramid\" title=\"\">\"bottom of the pyramid\"</a>, it's the so-called \"productive poor\" they have in mind, not the poorest of the poor. Even then, the <a href=\"http://hbr.org/2012/06/reality-check-at-the-bottom-of-the-pyramid/ar/1\" title=\"\">high penetration rates</a> required make profits hard to come by.</p> <p>Moreover, the private sector's solution to development evolves from capitalist orthodoxy. Developing countries, the argument runs, need more consumer-driven capitalism, not less. With the world's natural resources depleting fast, a rethink here can justifiably be demanded. Polman talks of \"decoupling\" economic growth from environmental impacts. It's a nice idea, of course, but hugely difficult in practice. Only one fifth of Unilever's energy is renewable, for example \u2013 and that's from a market leader.</p> <p>Lastly, there's the very real danger of tokenism. While Unilever has done more than most to integrate sustainability principles into core business operations, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/sustainable-living-plan-progress-unilever\" title=\"\">Polman's decoupled dream</a> remains a long way off. Most other companies are miles behind. Of course, <a href=\"http://www.businessfightspoverty.org/\" title=\"\">innovative business solutions</a> that tackle poverty are highly attractive. But not if they're tacked on to the main job of making widgets, as most still are.</p> <p>A company's primary development contribution derives from its everyday activities: the people it employs, the materials it sources, the products it sells, and the taxes it contributes. Ask any developing world policymaker if they'd rather have a free school or a fat royalty cheque, and the response should go without saying.</p>",
  "<h2>Equestrian 10am<br></h2> <p>Monday saw Team GB win gold in the team showjumping, beating their Dutch rivals in a jump-off. Great Britain's Nick Skelton, Ben Maher, Scott Brash and Peter Charles won Team GB's first equestrian gold in London 2012 and the country's first showjumping gold in 60 years. Germany, who are currently dominating the sport's medal table, will try to extend their lead in today's individual dressage and the team dressage.</p> <h2>Diving 10am<br></h2> <p>The men's 3m springboard semi-final and final will take place in the Aquatics Centre. With China dominating the diving medal table as expected, the favourites to collect the gold are He Chong and Tom Daley's big rival, Qin Kai.</p> <h2>Track cycling 10am<br></h2> <p>This is the last day in the velodrome and it will host one of the most exciting and keenly anticipated events at the Games. Sir Chris Hoy races in the men's keirin final with a chance to grab his sixth gold medal. Sir Chris will be up against the second favourite, Germany's Max Levy, who took silver behind the Scot in the World Track Championships in April. So far Britain have dominated in the velodrome and the golden performances look set to go on right to the end.</p> <h2>Athletics 10am<br></h2> <p>The athletics continues with the qualification rounds in women's javelin, the men's triple jump and women's long jump. There will be first rounds of the men's 110m hurdles, women's 5,000m and men's 200m, as well as semi-finals in the men's 800m and women's 200m and finals in the men's high jump, men's discus and men's 1500m. Team GB's Goldie Sayers competes in the women's javelin and her compatriot Andrew Osagie will attempt to sail through the men's 800m semi-finals.</p> <h2>Triathlon 11:30am<br></h2> <p>Saturday's women's triathlon, which saw Britain's world champion Helen Jenkins finish fifth, drew large crowds in and around Hyde Park. Today it is the men's turn. Great Britain have not won a triathlon medal since the sport was introduced at the Olympics at Sydney in 2000. The brothers Jonathan and Alistair Brownlee are favourites and are hoping to end that sequence on home soil. The world No1 Alistair and the world No2 Jonathan \u2013 at 22 the younger by two years \u2013 have been warned by the sport's world governing body they will be disqualified if they try to cross the finish line simultaneously in an act of brotherly love.</p> <h2>Beach volleyball 6pm<br></h2> <p>After battling their way out of the group stages to the semi-final, April Ross and Jennifer Kessy of the USA will play Brazil's Juliana Silva and Larissa Franca, below, who have not lost a set so far. China also play another USA duo, dubbed the \"queens of the beach\" \u2013 Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh Jennings \u2013 for a chance to compete in the final and prevent an all-American showdown.</p> <h2>Football 5pm<br></h2> <p>Having beaten Stuart Pearce's Team GB on penalties, South Korea now face Brazil \u2013 who have never won the Olympic gold medal \u2013 at Old Trafford at 7.45pm. Brazil look favourites after scoring 12 goals in four games. The first of the day's matches sees Mexico against Japan at Wembley. Mexico will be hoping Tottenham's Giovani Dos Santos can continue his fine Olympic form.</p> <h2>Brits to watch<br></h2> <p><strong>Phillips Idowu</strong></p> <p><strong>Athletics, triple jump</strong></p> <p><strong>10.45am</strong></p> <p>Phillips Idowu finally begins his hunt for gold in the men's triple jump qualification today. Idowu has been a source of mystery since before the Games began after it was thought he was \"missing\". However, he reassured fans saying: \"I'm in London where I have been for the last few weeks, finalising my prep and receiving therapy.\" Idowu arrived at the athletes' village yesterday, quashing rumours that an injury would end his London 2012 dream. He grew up in Hackney, a stone's throw from the Olympic Stadium, and it is there he will strive to obtain gold after a 5cm difference from Nelson Evora pushed Idowu to the silver medal position at the Beijing Olympics four year ago. He has won world and European championships in recent years.</p> <p><strong>Victoria Pendleton</strong></p> <p><strong>Cycling \u2013 Track, sprint </strong></p> <p><strong>4.00pm</strong></p> <p>Victoria Pendleton's gold in the women's keirin helped to make up for her disappointment at being disqualified from the team sprint, despite setting a world record. Today could see Pendleton pick up her second gold of London 2012 in the individual sprint. She won gold in this event in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, making her the defending champion this time. In the course of qualifying Pendleton smashed the Olympic record with a personal best time of 10.724sec. The 31-year-old's most serious rival is Australia's Anna Meares, who came second in the heat, and the two will meet again if both reach the final of this event. Pendleton is retiring after London 2012 and nothing would give her a better send-off than another gold medal.</p> <p><strong>Lawrence Okoye</strong></p> <p><strong>Athletics, discus</strong></p> <p><strong>7.45pm</strong></p> <p>Relatively unknown but tipped to be a star, Lawrence Okoye is 20 years old but finds himself in the final of the discus in his first Olympics. He was not among the favourites to go through but threw 65.28m with his final throw of qualification. Okoye is the British record holder in the event after throwing 68.24m at the Hallesche Werfertage meeting in May this year. He also won gold in July last year at the European Under-23 Championships. Okoye has deferred his place at Oxford University to study law in order to give athletics his undivided attention. He said: \"The two years I've spent doing this would have gone down the pan if I didn't get through.\" Okoye has a chance of getting a medal if he can throw close to his best today.</p>",
  "<p>With its wooden floors, leather sofas and customers peering at their Apple laptops as they sip their coffees, Mocca Cafe is the not the den of iniquity that might normally attract a police raid.</p> <p>But Islamabad's police have suddenly found cause to turn their attention to the capital's poshest eateries in an effort to enforce a patchily applied, decades-old law forbidding people from eating or drinking in public during the fasting month of Ramadan.</p> <p>Customers and proprietors were shocked on Saturday when, nearly halfway through the holy month, Mocca and at least two other popular eating spots in the well-heeled Kohsar market were visited by police officers cracking down on the illicit consumption of muffins and brownies, not to mention smoothies and skinny lattes.</p> <p>Members of what pass for Islamabad's cafe society said they could not remember anything like it. The manager of Gloria Jeans, a nearby restaurant, said he had never even read the Ramadan law until the police arrived. He has now placed a sign in the restaurant saying it is only \"open to the communities not observing the fast of Ramadan\".</p> <p>A message circulated on an expatriate email list by a customer who had been in the Gloria Jeans coffee shop at the time reported a \"large commotion\".</p> <p>\"There was a lot of hostility in the air because foreigners were being served while others (Pakistanis) were being told to leave,\" the email said, before going on to advise expats to give restaurants a wide berth until the end of Ramadan.</p> <p>\"Personally, I wouldn't take the chance after the anger I felt while in the coffee shop.\"</p> <p>The raids, which police say were prompted by a complaint from a member of the public, followed last month's police assault of a journalist who had the temerity to consume a soft drink in his car at a secluded hilltop beauty spot overlooking Islamabad.</p> <p>He said he was beaten with belts by the officers, who threatened to charge him under the Ramadan Ordinance, a law passed in 1981 by General Zia-ul-Haq, the then military ruler who did much to make Pakistani society more Islamic.</p> <p>Prior to the law, which allows for transgressors to be jailed almost on the spot for up to three months, restaurants simply covered their windows to conceal diners from public view.</p> <p>The heavy-handed policing of eating raises fears among some critics of a rising tide of Islamic conservatism within the state and society at large.</p> <p>\"This sort of behaviour is totally unwarranted, and a sign of the extremism that has infiltrated into the police,\" said Raza Rumi, a newspaper columnist.</p> <p>\"We have this double standard where the police take no action on the important things but when it comes to enforcing these Islamist positions they are more efficient than ever,\" he said.</p> <p>The police involved in last week's raids say they were simply enforcing the law. One senior officer, who did not wish to be named, said he was actually trying to discourage extremists.</p> <p>\"Personally I have no problem with people eating, but if the restaurants and hotels in the less privileged parts of the city are not serving food then it gives us an image problem with militants and religious people. They say the common people abide by the law, why don't you take action against the posh areas?\"</p> <p>The sensitivities of Pakistani liberals are all the more acute in Kohsar market. The small collection of shops and restaurants located between a mosque and a children's play area was the place where Salman Taseer, the governor of Punjab province, was gunned down by one of his government bodyguards in January 2011.</p> <p>He was walking past Mocca Cafe when his guard, furious at Taseer's public defence of a Christian woman sentenced to death under the country's much-criticised blasphemy laws for allegedly insulting Islam, shot him dead.</p>"
