  "<p>Scientists have pinpointed the Scots pine as the next well-loved British tree species that could fall victim to foreign pathogens. They believe that the expected devastation triggered as ash dieback disease sweeps Britain \u2013 which could see most of the country's 90 million ash trees killed off \u2013 could soon be followed by a second invasion.</p> <p><em>Pinus sylvestris</em> is considered to be particularly vulnerable because two major pests that attack it have already established themselves in western Europe: the pine wood nematode, a worm that infects pine trees and causes pine wilt, and the fungus <em>Fusarium circinatum</em>,<em> </em>which causes the disease pitch canker.</p> <p>Both pathogens are poised to spread to Britain, say tree experts, and a simultaneous double attack would be devastating. The Scots pine is the national tree of Scotland and is distinctive for its blue-green needles and rich orange-red bark. It is also an important source of timber in the UK.</p> <p>\"I am extremely worried about the Scots pine,\" said Dr Steve Woodward, reader in tree pathology at Aberdeen University. \"It is an iconic tree to these islands and it is particularly vulnerable to these two tree pathogens, both of which have established themselves in France, Spain and Portugal and are causing tremendous damage there.\"</p> <p>Woodward was speaking last week at a briefing at the Science Media Centre where leading researchers outlined the risks now facing the forests, woods, gardens and parks of Britain following the discovery that ash dieback, caused by the fungus <em>Chalara fraxinea</em>, has established itself.</p> <p>Ian Boyd, chief scientist at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), said the disease was probably now infecting mature trees in Kent as well as East Anglia, where it was first found. \"The disease almost certainly spreads through spores on the wind but may also spread through fallen leaves,\" said Boyd. However, he ruled out the use of chemicals to treat the disease as impractical given the numbers of trees involved.</p> <p>Ash dieback is just one of \"a tidal wave of pathogens\" that are arriving in Europe, added Dr Martin Ward, Defra's chief plant officer, who described the situation as terrifying. \"Unless we have better biosecurity in the EU it will be very difficult to stop them coming in,\" he added.</p> <p>This view was backed by Woodward, who feared the Scots pine was the most vulnerable of all UK trees to future pathogen invasions. \"We know that pitch canker is now established in northern Spain where it affects native pines, and we know that the Scots pine is susceptible to it. We also know that thousands of hectares of pines have had to be felled in Portugal to try to contain the pine wood nematode there. Now it has spread to Spain. It could arrive at any time.\"</p> <p>Billions of plants and trees are now traded within the EU every year, often with large amounts of soil attached to each plant, and experts like Woodward and Boyd fear such quantities of material make it impossible to control pathogens. \"Some plants have 1,000 litres of soil with them,\" said Joan Webber, principal pathologist of Forest Research, the research agency of the Forestry Commission. \"That soil is a black box full of billions of bacteria. It is very difficult to inspect and intercept.\"</p> <p>Most experts blame the rising trade in exotic plants from Asia as a key cause of the rise in outbreaks of tree diseases in the UK. Webber said that during the whole of the 20th century, Britain had five major pest and pathogen outbreaks, including two outbreaks of Dutch elm disease. So far this century, there have been more than double the total figure for the previous 100 years.</p> <p>Suggestions to try to limit future outbreaks include plant passports to reveal the origin of a sapling or cutting and placing some woods and parks in quarantine. Walkers have been urged to wash their boots after strolling in woods or forests. \"We are going to have to be very careful about how we treat our woods in future,\" Woodward said.</p>",
  "<p>Keith Hackett, who introduced the microphones worn by referees and their assistants, has called on the Football Association to bring forward a proposal to record match officials' conversations.</p> <p>The former general manager of Premier League referees has spoken out in the wake of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/31/chelsea-mark-clattenburg-complaint-fa\" title=\"\">Chelsea's allegations that Mark Clattenburg racially abused the midfielder Mikel John Obi</a> during their 3-2 defeat to Manchester United at Stamford Bridge last Sunday. Clattenburg denies the allegations <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/nov/02/sir-alex-ferguson-mark-clattenburg-innocent\" title=\"\">that prompted Sir Alex Ferguson to speak out in the referee's defence</a> on Friday.</p> <p>The FA say it is too soon following that incident to consider how they will address the issue with the International Football Association Board, the body that rules on law changes. However, if the game's various stakeholders wish to take up the issue in the future the FA would be open to it.</p> <p>Hackett told the <em>Observer</em>: \"The FA are members of the Ifab, so could bring forward a proposal to permit the recording of the conversations between players and officials during a game.\"</p> <p>Hackett would also allow fans and match commentators to hear those conversations. \"I would have no problems with fans having the ability to purchase a \"Ref! Link\" to listen in to what the match officials are saying,\" he said. \"I would like to see a referee-coach at the ground able to listen in to the team of officials. And given what has happened in the past few days and, with no knee jerk reaction, I would like to see conversations between the match officials for the full duration of the game recorded.\"</p> <p>The Ref! Link system is used in rugby union and allows spectators to overhear officials discussing their decisions with players during a match. Hackett introduced this system when he ran the Professional Game Match Official Board, the body in charge of elite referees, so that a referees' coach at Premier League matches could listen in to match officials' conversations. That was in 2006 but, according to Hackett, Fifa issued a directive that the system should not be used.</p> <p>Fifa, however, deny any such ruling was ever issued, stating that this would be a matter only for Ifab. The world body's stance is that there were informal discussions about whether officials' match conversations might be relayed to supporters.</p> <p>The FA could lead the way, however. Alex Horne, the FA's general secretary, is on the eight-member Ifab board, along with his Scotland, Wales and Ireland counterparts. Fifa take up the other four places, with six members required to be in agreement to make any changes to the laws.</p>",
  "<p><strong>I was in Aldi when I received a call from a friend I was to meet. I put back two items I'd picked up and went outside, whereupon a store security guard appeared and told me to empty the contents of my rucksack beside a busy main road. I asked him to hold some of my possessions, including research papers, so I wouldn't have to put them on the pavement, but he refused to help in any way. When I'd emptied the whole bag in front of passersby he told me everything was OK and left. I complained to the store manager but he seemed unconcerned. After several weeks and four letters from me, the store finally declared that it regretted any inconvenience and offered me a \u00a325 voucher.

The Security Industry Authority says it's up to individual stores or security firms to set their own protocols. In law, however, store guards have no powers to stop or detain anyone so you can refuse to comply and walk away. They can, like any of us, perform a citizens arrest and wait until police arrive, but then they lay themselves open to claims for unlawful arrest, says solicitor Julian Young of Julian Young &amp; Co.

  "<p>Are you aged 55 or more and planning to retire in the near future? Then you need to get your skates on because new rules to be implemented in December could mean you receive less retirement income from your pension savings.</p> <p>Until now, men have on average received about 4% more income from their annuities than women, because women tend to live longer. But the EU gender directive, which comes into force on 21 December, will stop insurance companies using the sex of a pension policyholder to determine the income the policyholder receives when they cash in their savings and buy an annuity. Insurers have said they will rely more heavily on other criteria, to underwrite annuities, including the type of work a policyholder has done and whether they suffer certain medical conditions.</p> <p>For men, the move means a sharp drop in annuity rates, building on a gradual decline over the past few years. Carl Lamb, managing director of Norwich-based independent financial adviser Almary Green, says this means that men planning to draw their retirement income in the near future should consider bringing their plans forward to take advantage of differential rates and secure a higher income. \"Ideally, they should ask for a quote now, then repeat that process every 14 days,\" he says. \"If they see the rate they are offered beginning to fall, it's a sign they should act very quickly to buy their annuity.\"</p> <p>However, Bob Bullivant of retirement specialist Annuity Direct, recommends investors ask an independent financial adviser to first check the terms of their pension: \"Look at your scheme to see if you are due a terminal bonus or are eligible for a guaranteed annuity rate. You would not want to give up those benefits just to get a gender-specific rate.\"</p> <p>Women may do slightly better to wait until after implementation of the rules because their rates are expected to increase by about 1%. But other factors have caused rates to fall in the past few weeks, says Bullivant, and there is no sign of that reversing. \"Any advantage they could get from the gender directive could be wiped out by a fall in annuity rates over the next six weeks,\" he adds.</p> <p>The move will also affect joint annuity rates \u2013 insurance contracts that continue to pay an income to the surviving partner after the first one has died \u2013 but this will vary depending on the comparative age of the partners. For a couple with a pension pot of \u00a3129,000 buying a level annuity, Legal &amp; General will currently pay \u00a35,955 a year where the man is 65 and the woman 62, based on the surviving spouse continuing to receive 100% of the pension income after their partner's death. But if the woman is 12 years younger, this drops to \u00a35,439 a year.</p> <p><strong>Shopping around</strong></p> <p>Annuity Direct says 85% of its clients end up with a better income by shopping around rather than buying an annuity from their pension provider. Pensioners can get a much higher income if they suffer from particular medical conditions, entitling them to buy an \"enhanced\" or \"impaired life\" annuity from a specialist provider such as Partnership or Just Retirement. Bullivant says shopping around has achieved incomes on average 20% higher than those offered by the incumbent providers.</p> <p>Some insurers plan to stop using gender in their pricing calculations before the rules come into force: the Prudential will switch on 12 November, while Aviva is expected to adopt unisex rates ahead of 21 December. The Prudential pays low annuity rates compared with other companies and Bullivant says its early move to stop using gender for underwriting makes it even more vital that all people with a Prudential pension shop around.</p> <p>Under recent rules, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/mar/05/pension-incomes-rise-annuity-reforms\" title=\"\">pension providers are now required to identify whether a client could qualify for an enhanced annuity</a>, and tell them where to buy one if they do not provide this product. However, these rules to not extend to members of certain occupational schemes \u2013 group personal pensions and defined contribution schemes set up in trust.<strong> </strong>If you are a member of this type of scheme, the provider has no obligation to offer you anything but its own annuities.</p> <p>Lamb was recently approached by a member of a defined contribution scheme, the trustees of which use one of Britain's biggest independent financial advisers to handle the sale of annuities. The member had built up a fund of \u00a3129,000, but was offered standard illustrations based on single and joint life annuities, with either a nil or five-year guarantee attached. Lamb says: \"No advice was provided, and the client was effectively given a menu to choose from. We ascertained that he was eligible for a enhanced annuity due to medical issues \u2013 he has diabetes \u2013 which lifted his annuity income by 15%.\"</p> <p><strong>Time frame </strong></p> <p>Alan Higham, chairman of Annuity Direct, says it can take between two and four weeks to research someone's pension scheme and decide whether it is appropriate for the policyholder to consider cashing in their fund. Quotations for annuity rates then typically last for 14 days before expiring.</p> <p>If the policyholder decides to go ahead and buy the annuity, the purchase can take anything from 10 days for Standard Life and Legal &amp; General, to two or three months with the likes of Abbey Life.</p> <p>Nick Bamford, of chartered financial planner Informed Choice, says that many providers guarantee the rate offered for up to a month once an application has been submitted.</p> <p>\"Some enhanced annuity providers will pro-actively tell us when rates are about to change, so we can request a new quote on the existing rate and extend the guarantee period for as long as possible,\" he adds. \"Regardless of the policies of different providers for holding rates, it makes sense to be ready to accept an annuity quotation very quickly once you start the process.\"</p> <p>Men wanting to take advantage of the differential rates available before 21&#xa0;December should bear in mind that the Christmas holidays will reduce whatever guarantee period your chosen annuity provider offers.</p>",
  "<p>The full extent of the crisis in morale gripping Scotland Yard has been exposed by an internal staff audit showing that only a third of officers would be confident of receiving a good service from the Met if they approached the organisation as members of the public.</p> <p>The findings, obtained by the <em>Observer</em>, collated the views of 13,379 serving Met employees, and follow warnings from the former Met commissioner Lord Stevens that the \"morale crisis\" at the heart of policing is now so acute it ought to be a matter of public concern.</p> <p>The dire financial plight of the Met was evident last week when the force announced it was selling its famous headquarters, New Scotland Yard, as part of a \u00a3500m cost-cutting plan.</p> <p>The internal independent audit, called Your Views Count and incorporating the views of hundreds of senior officers, also found that only a fifth of employees believe that the Met's senior leadership is \"doing a good job\", while just 27% trusted them \"to lead with integrity\".</p> <p>Alarmingly, only 19% believe that decisions made by senior management were taken with a view to what is best for the communities they police. Almost three in 10 said that some victims were \"more deserving of a good service than others\", raising the prospect that, on occasion, different approaches might be taken to victims who make a similar complaint. In addition, half of those who responded admitted that, despite a professional promise to treat everyone the same, \"certain communities do little to deserve the respect of the police\".</p> <p>Compared with previous surveys, the audit found that \"levels of satisfaction and morale are low and continuing to decrease\". It added that the malaise that it says exists \"across the organisation may be having a detrimental impact on the quality of our service delivery\".</p> <p>Chris Hobbs, a retired police officer who spent 23 years in the Met, including Special Branch, said: \"This survey makes disturbing reading, not just for ministers and chief police officers but for law-abiding members of the public.</p> <p>\"It suggests a serious breakdown in relations between frontline officers and those who command them, which compounds the contempt those same frontline officers hold for a government that seems unaware of the difficulties faced by officers on a daily basis.\"</p> <p>Problems also existed on a more local level, with only 19% of respondents believing that career development processes are fair. The survey, which was conducted in January and February but has only just come to light, would, according to Hobbs, present an even grimmer picture if conducted now.</p> <p>He said: \"Matters have deteriorated since then with further cuts, detrimental pension changes for many officers, officers being effectively made redundant with a real rift between those on the frontline and senior officers. A perception of constant unremitting criticism is contributing to a situation which could lead to a complete collapse of morale.\"</p> <p>The survey noted a low response \u2013 just one in four of the Met's 53,710 employees took part, including hundreds of homicide, counter-terrorism and firearms officers \u2013 but said that this might be explained by a perception that no management action would result from the findings.</p>",
  "<p>Traumatised Hillsborough survivors were \"bullied\" into changing their witness statements during prolonged and aggressive cross-examination by police officers, according to dramatic new allegations over the extent of the authorities' cover-up in the aftermath of the tragedy.</p> <p>Supporters have come forward to describe how West Midlands police subjected them to gruelling interviews lasting up to five hours in which they were coerced into amending statements that had portrayed the police in a negative light.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/12/hillsborough-disaster-inquest-prosecutions-report\" title=\"\">Hillsborough Independent Panel</a>, chaired by Bishop James Jones of Liverpool, recorded in September that senior officers had altered scores of police statements to hide the truth about the 1989 disaster, when 96 supporters were crushed to death at an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. The new claims that emotionally vulnerable survivors were forced by police into changing their accounts of the disaster have further infuriated victims' families.</p> <p>Merseyside Labour MP Maria Eagle, who has long campaigned on behalf of the Hillsborough familes, said survivors had recently approached her to explain how they were intimidated into changing their accounts during interviews carried out in the aftermath of the stadium crush. Survivors said they had been made to feel like criminals during cross-examination by West Midlands officers, even though they were grieving and still suffering from shock.</p> <p>Eagle, who is the shadow transport secretary, said she had seen a statement from one man \u2013 whose harrowing account of 15 April 1989 describes him struggling to survive the crush under the weight of dead fans \u2013 that appeared to have been amended following contact with the West Midlands force. \"One of the ways in which he'd coped was by writing it down. It's a terrible, traumatising account. He had people die pressed up against him.</p> <p>\"He was given a four- to five-hour grilling by the West Midlands police when they took his statement, treating him like a thief that they were trying to get to confess, telling him, 'You can't say that, you've got to say this.'</p> <p>\"He was given a real going over. Eventually, he was so browbeaten and upset that he agreed to make some of the changes they suggested. He's got a copy of his statement. The changes I've seen on the statement are all about taking out any suggestion that the police had lost control.\"</p> <p>A number of other survivors interviewed by West Midlands officers after the disaster have asked the force to release their statements, but to no avail.</p> <p>Margaret Aspinall, chairwoman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, said the actions of West Midlands police added a further dimension to the smear campaign that was orchestrated by the authorities to deflect scrutiny from their own failings by blaming the fans.</p> <p>Aspinall, whose son James died at Hillsborough, said: \"This shows they were prepared to stop at nothing. To bully the people they were meant to protect at a time when they were so traumatised is a disgrace. People will rightly ask how could this have happened?\"</p> <p>The role of West Midlands police in the cover-up is central, according to victims' families. During the aftermath of Hillsborough, the West Midlands force was appointed to collect evidence while investigating South Yorkshire police's handling of the disaster. However, its supposedly independent inquiry has been marred by claims that both forces were working together to blame the tragedy on football fans. Eagle said the claims added further material to evidence that the two forces colluded to deflect criticism away from the police.</p> <p>The Hillsborough Independent Panel revealed that West Midlands police knew that South Yorkshire officers had altered more than 100 statements, mostly to remove or alter \"unfavourable\" comments about the policing response to the disaster. In addition, evidence collated by West Midlands police went to the director of public prosecutions, who judged that there was \"insufficient evidence\" to bring charges.</p> <p>The force also provided key evidence used in the discredited Hillsborough inquests that delivered a verdict of \"accidental death\" for all the dead. Earlier this month, the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, said it would be investigating the West Midlands force's role in the Hillsborough disaster along with South Yorkshire's.</p> <p>Eagle hopes that the IPCC's investigation will also now include a focus upon allegations that fans were coerced to retract or amend their own statements relating to the FA Cup semi-final.</p> <p>Months after Hillsborough, when West Midlands began allegedly forcing supporters to amend their accounts, the force's elite squad of detectives, the serious crime squad, was disbanded amid allegations that it had been fabricating evidence to \"fit up\" armed robbers. Following its closure, the crime squad's former head, Detective Superintendent Stanley Beechey, helped to prepare evidence for the Hillsborough investigation, although no evidence has surfaced that he acted improperly.</p> <p>Meanwhile, pressure continues to mount for the inquest into the death of one Hillsborough victim to be fast-tracked after his mother was last week diagnosed with cancer. Anne Williams's son, Kevin, was 15 when he died in the disaster. She has always disputed the coroner's verdict of accidental death, particularly since it was proven that her son was still alive 45 minutes after the time when the coroner had earlier ruled that all victims were dead. Police officer Debra Martin has described how, at 4pm on the day of the disaster, Kevin had opened his eyes and said \"Mum\" before losing consciousness.</p> <p>However, she also admitted that two West Midlands officers had pressured her into changing a statement on the tragedy. She said the officers had repeatedly visited her trying to get her to change her statement until eventually she did. \"People need to realise there are two statements, my original and this horrible copy that has been done,\" she said.</p> <p><a href=\"http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/40925\" title=\"\">An online petition has been set up </a>calling for Kevin's inquest to be brought forward. It had already collected more than 20,000 signatures just days after it was set up last week. If it attracts 100,000 signatures, it will trigger a debate in the House of Commons.</p>",
  "<p>Several police forces could be investigated over their handling of sexual abuse allegations against Jimmy Savile after the police watchdog confirmed that an inquiry was a possibility and a lawyer representing alleged victims said there were urgent questions to be answered.</p> <p>Alan Collins, a solicitor at the law firm <a href=\"http://www.pannone.com/\">Pannone</a>, who is representing five of Savile's alleged victims and has been approached by at least 20 others, said the case for the police to be investigated had become paramount. Collins said it should be the job of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC), the independent body set up to assess police forces, to investigate how and when officers had investigated Savile.</p> <p>\"There should be an independent investigation into the decisions that were made,\" Collins said. \"There are key questions about what happened to several claims made against Savile and who decided how they should be followed up. There are police forces who had complaints on their books and chose not, for whatever reason, to pursue matters. That is a serious concern.\"</p> <p>At least three forces \u2013 Surrey, Sussex and Jersey \u2013 are known to have been aware of allegations against Savile, but the true number is believed to be as high as seven. \"We need to know: did they look at their databases? Did they talk to each other?\" Collins asked. HMIC confirmed that an inquiry could be launched. \"Although we are not currently inspecting the issues around this case, we are monitoring the developments,\" an HMIC spokesman said. \"HMIC have a programme of inspection work around child protection which is under way.\"</p> <p>Another option would be for the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which examines how complaints against the police have been handled, to launch an inquiry. But this would only go ahead if a complaint had been made directly to the IPCC or there had been a referral from a force. The IPCC said neither had happened.</p> <p>A focus on the police would take some of the pressure off the BBC, which has been the victim of a \"witch-hunt\", according to veteran presenter Jonathan Dimbleby, who has attacked the \"disturbing relish\" with which critics have laid into the corporation.</p> <p>\"Paedophilia is a huge national problem that no one thought about 50 years ago and is now something that concerns everyone, but this has become a witchhunt against the BBC,\" Dimbleby told a national newspaper.</p> <p>He added: \"Organisations that have come under flak recently, such as newspapers and MPs, want to get their revenge. They think the BBC is too smug and holier than thou.\"</p> <p>Collins said a picture was emerging of Savile as a risk-taker and an opportunist who surrounded himself with dubious characters. One line of inquiry is following Savile's links to the criminal underworld in Manchester, including the notorious Quality Street gang, who supposedly dominated the city in the 1960s.</p> <p>Collins said it was conceivable that lawyers acting for alleged victims would take legal action to compel police forces to hand over their files on Savile. He said such action would be taken if organisations like the BBC or the Savile estate denied liability, prompting lawyers to seek disclosure from the police.</p> <p>Last week Savile's estate, which is reportedly worth \u00a34.3m, was frozen in response to the mounting allegations. NatWest Bank, which is acting as the <em>Jim'll Fix It</em> presenter's executor and trustee, said the distribution of his assets had been put on hold in anticipation of legal action from his alleged victims.</p> <p>Savile, who died last year at the age of 84, is believed to have been one of the UK's most prolific sex offenders, with about 300 possible victims.</p> <p>The Metropolitan police force has signalled that it is prepared to send officers abroad if necessary to investigate the abuse allegations. Victims of alleged attacks relating to the Savile inquiry have so far come forward from France, Austria, Switzerland, South Africa and Australia.</p> <p>The alleged victims are understood to be Britons who subsequently moved abroad after being abused in Britain, as opposed to foreign nationals who were attacked during trips to the UK.</p> <p>Detectives are presently following 400 lines of inquiry, while the BBC has launched an inquiry into the culture and practices at the corporation in the era of Savile's alleged sexual abuse. It has also set up an investigation of the handling of a <em>Newsnight</em> report about Savile, which is being led by the former head of Sky News, Nick Pollard.</p>",
  "<p>The powerhouses of the modern game are about to collide in Brisbane and Ahmedabad and there will surely be some fireworks along the way. But will there also be some long goodbyes?</p> <p>We will be intrigued by three players, who share 510 Test caps, 41,520 Test runs and 113 years between them: Sachin Tendulkar, Ricky Ponting and Jacques Kallis. But will we be marvelling at their immortality or wincing as they vainly seek to recapture the magic of their earlier years? It could be enthralling; it could be very painful.</p> <p>Tendulkar and Ponting are now accustomed to queries about their future but somehow retirement has not been an issue with Kallis recently. It may be that his recent form has been so impressive; it can't just be that the new batch of hair upon Kallis's head creates an impression of youthfulness, which deflects any interrogators.</p> <p>Both Tendulkar and Ponting have insisted that they are pragmatists. \"I am 39,\" said Tendulkar recently, \"and I&#xa0;don't think I have plenty of cricket left&#xa0;in me. But it depends on my frame of mind and my physical ability. As long&#xa0;as I feel I can deliver I will continue playing\".</p> <p>Ponting, in conversation with Ian Chappell last week, explained what keeps him going: \"It's the thrill of the contest.\" But he added: \"I'm a realist and I'll understand if there are players out there who can play better than me. I'll be the first to walk away. I'm not going to let it get to the stage where the selectors drop me. I think I'll identify the right time.\"</p> <p>The great players always say that. They think they know the best time to go but they are not always right. Very often the worst judge of a cricketer's worth is the cricketer himself, especially if he is a really high achiever.</p> <p>This should not surprise us. One component of the great sportsman is a deep reservoir of self-belief that insists that he can prevail whatever the circumstances, whatever the odds \u2013 and whatever his age. The best are seldom defeated because of their own frailties. External factors intervene: a little stone on the pitch causing the ball to deviate freakishly, a spectator in front of the sightscreen at the critical moment and, on one occasion, according to Brian Close many years ago, the 12th man's inability to deliver the correct flavour of chewing gum.</p> <p>Anyone with that innate self-belief is most unlikely to reach the conclusion that the powers are on the wane. That would contradict the thought processes of two decades. Hence Tendulkar and Ponting are not guaranteed to be the best judges of when to go. They need good, strong men/women around them. They may well have them.</p> <p>We know that Ponting has a chairman of selectors of vast cricketing wisdom and experience in John Inverarity. Ponting, it is true, will never be dropped. His standing in Australia does not allow that. But this does not mean that when the time comes Inverarity will shy from his duty to have a word, directing one of Australia's greatest to go gracefully.</p> <p>The South Africans will seek to hasten this process this week. Their first weapon will be pace \u2013 and they have some in the shape of Morne Morkel and Dale Steyn. Ponting is 37. His ability to pull fast bowling was awesome from the moment he first turned up at the Australian academy as&#xa0;a teenager. Rodney Marsh has recalled how a little audience would assemble for lunchtime sessions in the&#xa0;indoor school where he would ratchet up the bowling machine and Ponting, to general consternation, would keep pulling.</p> <p>But the eyes and the reflexes start to go sometime. Likewise the Australians, aware of his frailty against the early yorker, will check out Kallis's reactions to their fastest bowling. They know he has a sublime technique but what about those 37-year-old eyes?</p> <p>In India there is always unfettered adulation whenever Tendulkar comes to the crease. But if England can undermine him then there will be torment in the subcontinent.</p> <p>Tendulkar, in his 23rd year as a Test cricketer, is deified in India and it is tough to drop a deity. He has just hit a hundred against the Railways in a rare outing for Mumbai but there are no real gods in cricket and he could yet become a source of angst for the home side if the Test runs dry up in his 40th year.</p> <p>England will go hard at him and at Virender Sehwag as well. Sehwag is 34, not necessarily MS Dhoni's bosom pal, and he has not hit a Test century for two years. Once again there will be a determination to test those reflexes. For the first time the arrival of Tendulkar and Sehwag at the crease may provide an opportunity for India's opponents rather than a source of extreme apprehension. Or this pair may still be capable of flirting with immortality. Either way it will be interesting.</p>",

The last known arrest came shortly before Akin's 1988 election to the Missouri State House, where he served for 12 years before he joined the House.</p> <p>Akin campaign spokesperson&#xa0;<strong>Rick Tyler</strong>&#xa0;declined to comment on the new arrest records.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50956fd9b579f74bac7649d8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-03T19:26:17.377Z\">7.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Slate's Dave Weigel checks out <strong>early voting in Ohio.</strong> </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/264804257163788288\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Early voting in Cincinnati.

Both measures were eventually blocked by federal courts.&#xa0;</p> <p>Mitchell was also the man behind the removal of convicted felons from the Florida voters' role in 2000 which led to many innocent people with similar names being deprived of the right to vote. A disproportionate number of them were African Americans, who tend to vote for Democrats.&#xa0;The League of Women Voters said that Mitchell's involvement in the most recent legislation is evidence of a \"partisan agenda to manipulate the voting rules\".</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-03T16:20:47.323Z\">at 4.20pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50953cf595cb1506d24447b4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-03T15:49:10.127Z\">3.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Former President Bill Clinton</strong> has just taken the stage at the Obama rally in Chesapeake, Virginia.</p> <p>Clinton will appear with Obama tonight at a major rally in Bristow, Virginia.</p> <p>The crowd likes them some Clinton.

The NBC/WSJ/Marist poll from yesterday midnight puts Obama ahead 49-47. But a new Tampa Bay Times / Miami Herald poll puts Mitt Romney ahead in the state by 6 points.</p> <p>The Guardian's Chris McGreal reports that the Tampa Bay poll backs up anecdotal evidence from voting lines. It's the last day of early voting in Florida, he notes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/content/tampa-bay-times-fla-poll-romney-51-obama-45\">The poll</a> gives Romney 51% to 45% for Obama, a slight drop on the Republican candidate's surge following the president's lacklustre performance in the first debate. Other polls have the race tighter but with Romney generally holding a two percentage point lead.&#xa0;</p> <p>The Tampa Bay Times / Miami Herald poll confirms anecdotal evidence from voting lines - that a good number of undecideds have been persuaded that Romney will do a better job of fixing the economy even if they are not happy with the Republicans on other issues, such as unemployment. Many voters say that the principal issue for them is jobs in a state hit particularly hard by unemployment and the property crash.</p> <p>Both parties are claiming that early voting trends in Florida give them the upper hand. The Republicans say that Democratic turnout is down on four years ago. Democrats say that they are still ahead in absolute terms.&#xa0;About 3.5 million Floridians have voted early so far - either by post or in person. That's about 30% of the state's electorate and a dramatic increase on 2008 when 2.7 million voted early.</p> <p>About 1.39 million of those are registered Republicans and 1.47 are Democrats.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>The last time a team tried to go 50 matches unbeaten, the game ended in acrimony, pizza being flung about in the tunnel after the match, cheese and tomato running down Sir Alex Ferguson's suit.</strong> Could it happen again? Well, we are in Italy. So yes. Let's say yes. By 9.30pm, expect to see Antonio Conte covered in pepperoni. </p> <p><strong>Juventus's win over Bologna on Wednesday night, inspired by one Paul Pogba, brought their unbeaten run to 49 games.</strong> Forty-nine! And to think they were in Serie B a few years ago. There's hope yet for Rangers. Sort of. </p> <p><strong>No surprise that the champions are top of Serie A then.</strong> After 10 games, they've won nine and drawn one to lead Inter by four points. Many observers of Italian football are, of course, putting such a stunning record down to the influence of Nicklas Bendtner. It's possible Gigi Buffon, Andrea Pirlo, Arturo Vidal and Mirko Vucinic have played a part too. Conte should probably take some of the credit ... if only for signing Bendtner. </p> <p><strong>They've got a job on their hands tonight though.</strong> After a ropey start to the season, Inter have clicked under young Andrea Stramaccioni and arrive at the Juventus Stadium on the back of a hot seven-match winning streak. The 36-year-old appears to have finally stabilised the club after the hangover caused by Jose Mourinho's departure following their Champions League win in 2010. Stramaccioni is Inter's fifth manager since then; he could well be The Man. </p> <p><strong>Juventus:</strong> Buffon, Barzagli, Bonucci, Chiellini, Lichtsteiner, Vidal, Pirlo, Marchisio, Asamoah, Vucinic, Giovinco.</p> <p><strong>Inter:</strong> Handanovic; Ranocchia, Samuel, Juan; Zanetti, Gargano, Cambiasso, Nagatomo; Palacio, Cassano, Milito. </p> <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 7.45pm by the British Time.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>An email.</strong> \"Surprised you weren't MBM-officiating the West Ham game, presumably that's to avoid any accusations of Clattenburg-doing-Man U bias,\" says Ryan Dunne. \"Nice Glorious Glasgow Rangers reference too. Re: 50 games. If memory serves, a lot of people characterised Man U spoiling Arsenal's attempts to go 50 not out as a victory for thuggery and spoiling over the beautiful game, Man U kicking Arsenal's lovely swashbucklers and winning with a jammy header from the not-exactly-flair-player Darren Fletcher. Not being a regular serie a follower (Parma's pink strips are cool though), is this Juventus side getting Arsenal-style respect and admiration from neutrals and pundits?\"</p> <p>No idea! I've hardly seen Juventus play. I understand they're rather tasty though. Contributions are welcome.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Off we go!</strong> Juventus get us going, kicking off from left to right. There's a rare old din inside the Juventus Stadium. My poor ears. Or left ear - for some reason, only the left headphone works when you're watching ESPN here. Anyway...</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Juventus 1-0 Inter (Vidal, 1 min):</strong> What a start! Juventus have taken the lead after only 20 seconds! Not that the goal should have scored, because Asamoah was at least a yard offside in the build-up. There may be some discussion about the officials afterwards. Call me a cynic, but. It was a wonderfully swift and decisive move, mind you. Inter were all over the place as Vucinic poked a pass through for Asamoah - who was offside - and the midfielder slashed a poor shot across goal from left to right, where Vidal was waiting for a tap-in. The ground erupts. Juve's players go crazy. More please!</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> On the touchline, Andrea Stramaccioni is having a discussion with the fourth official. He has the funk on.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> Juventus are tearing into Inter at will here. Giovinco pulls over to the right and flashes a brilliant cross into the middle that just evades Marchisio and Asamoah. That could so easily have been 2-0. Pirlo then chips a classic Pirlo pass over the top and Handanovic punches away from Giovinco. Not that it matters: this time the flag is up for offside.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Is there anything more exciting than Italian football?</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> \"Assuming ESPN are correct and Inter are going 3-4-3 tonight, isn't Strammacioni using the same system that got Gasperini sacked?\" asks Sam Blanning. Well I suspect Stramaccioni has tried to match his side up with Juve's formation. It hasn't worked especially well so far though.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Andrea Pirlo is quite a good player. He clips a glorious first-time pass over the top of the gawping Inter defence for the onrushing Marchisio, who waits for the ball to drop from the sky before hitting a first-time volley that Handanovic pushes wide for a corner. What a save. What a pass.<em> Pirlo</em>.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Of course, the Inter tactic of letting-Andrea-Pirlo-do-what-he-wants is helping Juventus. There's no pressure on him at all as he finds Marchisio again in the area. The midfielder takes the ball down on his chest and then dribbles a volley straight at Handanovic.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> Finally Inter show up front. First Cambiasso cracks one over from 25 yards out, before Juve lose the ball in their own final third, and a loose ball breaks for Cambiasso who whips an instant effort just over. Buffon didn't move, although that might just have been him showing off. There's been more action packed into this opening 10 minutes than you get in most games.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> Inter aren't having any luck with the officials. A quick free-kick from the left catches out Juve's defence and Palacio steals in to glance a header low past Buffon, but the flag is up for offside. Let's just say it was a much tighter decision than the Juventus goal. Juve, of course, got away with one against Catania last Sunday too.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> Still, when your luck's in...</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Giovinco pierces the Inter defence but Vidal is roughly 453 yards offside. Even these officials can't miss that. \"Re your Italian football being exciting comment, can I say that it's very much dependent on your team,\" says Michael Nimmo. \"I'm a season ticket holder for Genoa, and it looks like being a long old season. Sure, it was exciting when Juve came, but more for their supporters than ours when they inconsiderately kept on scoring goals. Tonight is very much a battle between two unpleasant teams (not on the pitch, there they're quite good), but seeing Juve lose their unbeaten record at home against Inter would be quite fun.\"</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> Another lightning Juventus attack is brought to a halt by Javier Zanetti, 83. The delightfully impish Giovinco tries to wriggle into the Inter area but Zanetti <em>uses all his experience</em>. \"On the way home after a bit of a corporate at Craven Cottage,\" says Freeloading's Gary Naylor. \"My first time watching top flight football up close for a few years (maybe from when Wimbledon played at Selhurst Park). God knows football has plenty wrong with it, but it was a helluva spectacle today.\"</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> Friendly advice: don't take your eyes off this match.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Nagatomo tries to put in a cross from the left but Lichsteiner blocks it behind for Inter's first corner. There's a delay before the corner can be taken while the referee pretends to sort out some wrestling in the area. The first corner's a waste, but Inter get another go. This time they roll it short to Cassano on the edge of the area and he bends a shot <em>inches</em> past the far post. Buffon was definitely beaten.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Inter have settled now and are starting to exert some control on proceedings. I'm not sure if Juventus can maintain this sort of pace for 90 minutes.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> \"Juve are quite strong this year in serie A,\" notes Ben Dunn. \"Milan gave them Pirlo in exchange for a match ball and a set of luminous cones because he was obviously shot (he has yet to lose a game in black and white) and then sold Ibra, who is quite good in Italian football, and Silva, ditto. The other teams, Inter included, are utter pith. Juve in Europe will show their level, which is out of the top four in all other leagues of importance. i.e. not French).\"</p> <!-- Block 20 -->       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WO5y0DMA0LE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WO5y0DMA0LE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Apropos of nothing, here's a wonderful Alessandro Del Piero goal in this fixture in 1998.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Lichsteiner plays a pass to Vucinic, failing to notice the striker had his back to him and had walked off the pitch, looking to sort out a problem with his calf. Nicklas Bendtner is warming up and egregiously applauding the Juve fans.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> Barzagli tries to score from 35 yards out. Stop it.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> Lichsteiner is booked after an industrial-strength challenge on Cambiasso.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>31 min:</strong> Cambiasso's free-kick is an abject waste of time from an Inter perspective and from it, Juventus go close to doubling their lead. Giovinco hares away down the right and with only one Inter defender back, he should find Vucinic to his left. His pass was poor though, allowing another defender to get back to mop up.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Now Samuel is booked after bringing down Giovinco.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Lichsteiner, already booked, catches Palacio. He should be sent off. He's not. How odd.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> A dreadful mistake from the increasingly inept Ranocchia lets Asamoah in down the left. He could drive towards goal - and also has team-mates in the middle - but curiously decides to cut the ball back to Vidal on the edge of the area. He's not expecting the pass and Juan dispossess him.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>38 min:</strong> Lichsteiner, who should have been sent off a few minutes ago, is replaced by Martin Caceres. Are you watching, Arsene?</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> \"My girlfriend, who is absolutely inwardly delighted that I'm reading an MBM and emailing you, was fairly unblown over that you'd published my previous email, despite my satisfaction,\" says Michael Nimmo. \"She said that she'd always wondered who would write into to stuff like this, and I'm pretty sure she had imagined it was the handsome life-and-soul types like me and other emailers, who are of course passing over other saturday night plans with people to follow your updates. Oh.\" She's a lucky girl.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> Just to recap, Juventus have had a blatantly offside goal given and should be down to 10 men, while Inter have had a goal disallowed for offside.

And I hate Juve. But this argument of Juve 'showing (Serie A's) level' in Europe is silly looking at their 2-2 match against Chelsea, ManU needing to scrape come-from-behind wins at home against unknowns, and the champs ManCity being bottom of their group. Serie A remains one the top 4 leagues in Europe, and to say otherwise based on recent results ignores Premier League struggles, as well as seeming petty.\"</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Handanovic has to back-pedal and push an awkward cross from Asamoah over his own bar after it took a deflection off Zanetti. \"An MBMer with a girlfriend?!\" asks Ryan Dunne. \"Emailing on a Saturday night?! I think you should request Michael Nimmo supply photographic proof of this absurdity.\"</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>45 min+1:</strong> Nagatomo and Juan clown about like a pair of ... clowns, actually, each leaving a loose pass for the other, failing to react as Vidal sneaks in between the pair of them and hammers a low drive goalwards from the edge of the area. Handanovic gets down well to save and Vidal blasts the rebound miles wide from a tight angle.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>Half time: Juventus 1-0 Inter.</strong> Well that flew by.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>SATURDAY NIGHT ENTERTAINMENT DEP'T:</strong> Nicklas Bendtner has replaced the injured Mirko Vucinic for Juventus. Inter get the ball rolling in the second half. Juve are 45 minutes away from going 50 games unbeaten. \"Re Ryan Dunne's photographic proof-request, I did suggest that i send a photo of her to prove her existence, but she laughed,\" says Michael Nimmo. \"I guess she's embarrassed to be seen on an Italian MBM, English football's much more her bag.\"</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> \"Watching in Co Meath, Ireland, and it's even a Saturday night here, too,\" says Paul Neilan. \"Just one thing; Vucinic, why? He's a donkey. For a team about to go 50 games unbeaten he has been piss-poor all season. He's clunky, immobile, has an attitude etc. I just don't get it anymore (see Saturday night in, above).\" Nicklas Bendtner is his understudy.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Pirlo is booked for hauling back Palacio. Will they take him off now? Probably not. Cassano slices the resulting free-kick miles wide. His response is to just stand there ruefully shaking his head.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> \"Admitedly English teams are on the wane in Europe, despite being current champions,\" admits Ben Dunn. \"But on the European scale (I don't know how it works but there are points accumulated from the last five years) Italian teams are struggling to keep Italy with three Champions league places. They have performed very poorly and this is represented in the their European results - there have been a number of articles in the Gazzetta dello Sport on the subject. I believe England are heading in that general direction too, but at the moment are still considerably stronger, over a period of five years than Serie A.\"</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> Bonucci, scourge of gun-wielding muggers, strolls forward from the back and then unleashes from 25 yards out, bringing a fine save out of Handanovic. Moments later Chiellini is booked for persistent fouling.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> Ranocchia launches a ball down the inside-right channel for Palacio to chase. He reaches it ahead of Buffon, touching the ball round the Juve keeper, but can only send it into the side-netting from a very tight angle.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Inter's threat is growing. Chiellini loses the ball and Inter set off on the break, Milito running at the backtracking Juventus defence. He moves it to the right for Palacio, who hammers it woefully over the bar. That was awful. There's then a stoppage in play after some moron hits the official behind the goal with something thrown from the crowd. On ESPN, Stewart Robson opines that he hopes the official isn't making the most of it. Comments don't get much stupider than that. The official is fine though. His neck's a bit sore, mind you.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> Nagatomo bursts into the area and cracks a rising drive towards the far corner, Buffon beating it away. Inter are the better side.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> <strong>PENALTY TO INTER!</strong> A free-kick to Inter just outside the area. Instead of shooting, they try to work a clever one in the style of Argentina against England in 1998, but it comes to nothing as Marchisio has a handful of Diego Milito's shirt in the area. A clear penalty.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Juventus 1-1 Inter (Milito pen, 59 min):</strong> This is fairly conclusive. Milito slams the penalty high into the top-right corner to level it up. Juve's unbeaten record is under threat now but this is no more than Inter deserve. It's been coming.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> It's all Inter. Bonucci clumsily brings down Milito on the left and goes into the book. Juve are rocking. The free-kick comes to nothing though. \"Fair dos MIchael Nimmo,\" fair-dos Ryan Dunn. \"I should stress that I'm only really dipping into tonight's MBM; my primary online focus being Wookiepedia articles about the new Star Wars movies, plainly a far more girlfriend-conducive online activity.\"</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> From the left, Pirlo curls a free-kick straight at Handanovic, who elects to punch it away.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Giovinco dips and tricks his way into the Inter area, before crumbling underneath the softest of challenges from Gargano. No penalty.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> Fredy Guarin replaces Antonio Cassano for Inter.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> I'm not sure that Nicklas Bendtner has touched the ball yet. Taking a throw-in doesn't count.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>72 min:</strong> Javier Zanetti is making Asamoah look very raw indeed.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Caceres makes a great tackle to deny Cambiasso! A low ball was fizzed in from the right by Palacio. Milito couldn't reach it at the near post, but as the ball broke loose Caceres recovered brilliantly to stop Cambiasso shooting from six yards out.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Juventus 1-2 Inter (Milito, 75 min):</strong> Now Juventus's unbeaten run really is on the brink. Arturo Vidal gave the ball away in a dangerous area and the substitute Guarin charged forward, showing a terrific change of pace against the exposed Juventus defence, bursting easily past Chiellini. His low drive from 25 yards out was pushed out by Buffon but only as far as Milito, who made no mistake from eight yards out. Juventus have 15 minutes left to rescue their record, but they have done very little in the second half.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> Fabio Quagliarella replaces Martin Caceres for Juventus. Caceres, of course, was subbed on in the first half.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Mudingayi comes on for Diego Milito, whose two goals looks like ruining Juve's night.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Handanovic flies to his left to tip a Pirlo piledriver from 25 yards out past the post. The corner is cleared. But now, inevitably, Inter are being pushed back.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> Inter nearly shoot themselves in the foot, Gargano's pass back to Handanovic intercepted by Bendtner, whose attempted chip on the turn from a tight angle drifts harmlessly wide.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Zanetti is booked for cynically tugging back Asamoah on the left. Palacio heads Pirlo's free-kick away.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Quagliarella turns, beats his man and hits a rising drive just past the right post from 25 yards out. So close. But the unbeaten record is slipping away.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p>GOAL! THERE GOES THE UNBEATEN RECORD! Juventus 1-3 Inter (Palacio, 90 min): No one's getting past 49 games. Not tonight, anyway. With Juventus committing men forward in search of an equaliser, Inter catch them horribly short on the break. Nagatomo broke down the left and saw his initial shot blocked, but recovered possession, cut inside and slipped a pass through to Palacio, who prodded a shot underneath Buffon. What a turnaround. Inter fully deserve this.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>90 min+1:</strong> There will be three minutes of stoppage time. But nothing's doing for Juventus now. The stadium is emptying.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>90 min+2:</strong> It will be interesting to see how Juventus react to this defeat. Arsenal never recovered from losing their unbeaten record to Manchester United in 2004.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>Full time: Juventus 1-3 Inter.</strong> That's it! Juventus's run ends at 49! No one's touching the 58 games Fabio Capello's Milan put together. Inter celebrate wildly, while Juventus can hardly believe it, either on or off the pitch. Juventus are still top - a point ahead of Inter - but suddenly everyone will look at them in a very different light. They <em>can</em> be beaten. Thanks for reading. Bye.</p>",
  "<p>Reclining in an office chair usually filled by the transport minister, Norman Baker, who is away for the day, Sir Howard Davies, 61 \u2013 former senior mandarin at the Treasury, one-time aide to Nigel Lawson, former director of the London School of Economics, head of the Financial Services Authority under Labour and now chairman of Phoenix Insurance \u2013 oozes the confidence of a man who has seen it all before.</p> <p>\"It happened in the way these things do. Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, gave me a call and said, ehm, your number's come up,\" he chuckles. \"I was slightly surprised. It wasn't an obvious thing to do, although, curiously enough, I did a couple of years in the Treasury on aerospace, but I don't think Jeremy was even aware of that when he asked me.\"</p> <p>Ever since, critics have been lining up to point out how far it was from being the \"obvious thing to do\". Heywood was inviting Davies to be the man to decide whether and where to build Britain's next major airport, an issue that in other countries might be regarded as a dry administrative task, but in the UK is a peculiarly red rag to the many-headed bull that is the green lobby, local communities under flight paths, regional tsars jealous of the south-east and political leaders looking to display their environmentally friendly or business credentials \u2013 depending on the fashion.</p> <p>Then, of course, there's Boris Johnson, a London mayor in search of a defining issue for his political career, frustrated that the prime minister has not made a decision on the issue, determined to have a third runway at Heathrow ruled out, and for a new airport, popularly known as \"Boris Island\", to be built swiftly on the Thames estuary.</p> <p>It is a political quagmire that even the most capable of mandarins might struggle with and Davies has not, it is pointed out, enjoyed the easiest of times recently. His period as executive chairman of the FSA, where he stewarded light-touch regulation of the City between 1997 and 2003, cannot be said to have been an unqualified success. It was on his watch that the banking crisis, which in part delivered the UK its double-dip recession, was brewing.</p> <p>His next job was as director of the LSE, a position he resigned from last year after it emerged that the university had taken a \u00a3300,000 donation from a foundation run by none other than the playboy son of Colonel Gaddafi, Saif, who is currently incarcerated by the new Libyan government but wanted by the International Criminal Court to face charges of crimes against humanity.</p> <p>Perhaps it was felt that a decision on airport capacity would be a doddle for a man who has dealt with all that. As a Treasury mandarin in 1979 he was, after all, in charge of nationalising British Aerospace under Labour, then equally quickly privatising it under Margaret Thatcher. \"It was crazy,\" he admits.</p> <p>But Davies's frustration at the political debate raging, even on day one of the launch of his commission into Britain's aviation \u2013 due to publish an interim report in 2013 and a final one in 2015 \u2013 is evident: \"Obviously we have to have a public process here but the public process I want is about the issues rather than about the timing and the politics.\"</p> <p>On Friday morning he gave a short interview to the <em>Today</em> programme but didn't know, until he spoke to the producers, that Johnson, all fired up, was coming on later to trash everything he had said, in particular the plan to wait three years for Davies's answers to the big questions. It was an undoubted attempt to ambush Davies on his big day. \"Did he succeed?\" Davies asks. The headlines the following day suggest Johnson may have, although it will be Davies's word on Britain's airports that will be the last.</p> <p>The former mandarin, who will work \"a day, or a day and a half, a week\" in the unpaid role, admits that he \"can't be convinced\" that when he reports in 2015 the politicians will actually listen.</p> <p>It may be a new government; what is certain is that the politics of the moment will be different, and that matters. The Conservatives, who delighted in ruling out a third runway at Heathrow before the 2010 general election on environmental grounds, are now procrastinating and split on the issue, hence pushing it into what Davies admits is the \"long grass\" of his commission.</p> <p>And Labour has been on a diametrically opposite journey. \"I note it is not that long ago that the Labour party was in favour of the third runway and appeared to be going to go ahead and now it is not fashionable again,\" he says. \"I don't think you can take these things as completely fixed anyway.\"</p> <p>So he won't allow Boris and the politics of the moment to come into the commission's thinking? \"No, I don't think we can afford them to be. I think the whole point of asking an independent commission to do this is in order not to do that. I observe the political debate swirling around this, but I don't think it makes sense to get involved in it.</p> <p>\"I think you have to step back a bit and start with demand forecasts, how do you fit it into the climate change commitment? How different is the rail environment, does that open up options that you've not had before? And you have to build from there and see where that takes you. But we have been told that all options, including the third runway, are on the table and for the moment that is where they shall remain.\"</p> <p>Whatever way Davies falls on the issues ahead, there will be critics, fierce ones. How do you weigh up the interests of homeowners under the flight path at Heathrow against the economic stimulus of building a proper hub airport, with one, maybe two, new runways? \"We haven't worked that out yet. The things you have got to look at include 'are you going to create more unpleasant noise for people?'.</p> <p>\"There are some options which say that you wouldn't necessarily do that. If you move where the runways are, there are options for moving Heathrow westward; that's an interesting sort of idea which would reduce the noise envelope. Other countries have got other compensation regimes, but we haven't got an equation for doing that at this point.\"</p> <p>But he is equally keen to look at Boris's plan, which is why he insisted to the prime minister that his commission needed to at least shortlist the options in his 2013 interim report. \"The estuary island has the mayor supporting it, but it doesn't really have a corporate sponsor because it isn't there. So if you decide that is the one you want to look at, you need to have time to do some more work yourself, and the commission will do more work to level the playing field, if you like\".</p> <p>What clearly will not influence Davies, a Manchester Grammar School boy, Oxford graduate and alumnus of Stanford Graduate School of Business, is the prime minister's notion of a happiness index, once promoted by David Cameron as a rival barometer of success to growth which, it was said, would play a key role in the big future policy decisions.</p> <p>\"I think that's quite difficult territory and I haven't seen that that has gone terribly far,\" he says. \"There are these, you know, happiness indices, but I don't quite know what they mean really.\"</p> <p>Neither can we expect him to be a climate change pioneer. He worked as an adviser to the sceptic Nigel Lawson in the 1980s, but refuses to discuss his own views, adding that it is irrelevant because he will work within the government's climate change commitments.</p> <p>\"I am honestly not sufficiently expert to have my own independent views on climate change,\" he says. \"But certainly the fact that I once worked for Nigel Lawson\u2013 now 28 years ago \u2013 is not relevant. What I do is take whatever the commitment is. There is a government commitment, and indeed there is legislation, that says we are going to reduce our emissions by 80% by 2050.\"</p> <p>It is possible, of course, that Davies could simply rejig things and not suggest any building projects at all in 2015. There is spare capacity in less popular airports, while some in the environmental lobby say that the UK would be able to cope with demand up until 2050, based on a recent dip in the number of people travelling and perhaps pessimistic forecasts on the UK's economic growth.</p> <p>But it doesn't sound likely. \"I was in Scotland last week and there were two flights a day to go to Dubai, taking people and rerouting them to India, or wherever. So now we might decide as a nation that that is sustainable, but clearly at the moment it is not the plan is it? Nobody is saying we should stop having any flights here and they should bugger off and go somewhere else.</p> <p>\"So given that the brief is to say how do you maintain international hub status, it does look like doing nothing is not likely to achieve that.\"</p> <p>Is Davies, despite the delays, ultimately going to be seen as a man of action? \"Actually, I've got to go now. I've got an insurance company to run.\"</p>",
  "<p>David Miliband has joined forces with his party leader brother Ed behind Labour plans to deliver a \"living wage\" of well over \u00a37.20 an hour \u2013 rising to more than \u00a38.30 in London \u2013 for millions of workers in both the public and the private sectors.</p> <p>The Miliband brothers, whose relationship has been tense since Ed narrowly defeated David in the 2010 leadership contest, are working closely together on how to make the living wage \u2013 as opposed to the lower minimum wage \u2013 the new norm and a core economic policy for Labour at the next election.</p> <p>In a sign that relations are thawing with his brother and with the left of the party, David today reveals radical ideas on the living wage that are being considered by the party <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/03/miliband-prentis-living-wage\" title=\"Observer: a living wage for all\">in a joint article for the Observer with Dave Prentis</a>, general secretary of the public service union Unison. The former foreign secretary, who has declined an open offer to join the shadow cabinet, says that financial incentives could be offered to local authorities and other employers that require their private contractors to pay the living wage, as a condition of them getting work.</p> <p>Reflecting studies going on in Labour's policy review, he and Prentis say that local authorities could be rewarded with some of the savings accrued from reductions in the bill for in-work benefits.</p> <p>As a string of Labour-run local authorities prepare to be recognised as official living wage employers, Miliband and Prentis hail the minimum wage delivered by New Labour in 1998 as a \"great success\".</p> <p>But defining a living wage as a rate of pay that allows workers to provide themselves and their families with the \"basis of a decent life\", they insist that more must be done to lift people out of in-work poverty and address the crisis of falling living standards in low to middle-income families.</p> <p>\"Recent reports have highlighted the growing gap between rich and poor, including an important warning from the Resolution Foundation that by 2020 families will be no better off than they were in 2000,\" they say. \"This problem needs to be mended if we are to make progress as a nation \u2013 fair pay for a fair day's work has to be part of that basic&#xa0;deal.\"</p> <p>They say that, rather than destroying jobs, paying a living wage above the minimum acts as a boost to the local economies. \"There are clear and proven benefits to local communities and businesses, too \u2013 people have more money to spend and they spend it locally.</p> <p>\"Big companies such as KPMG and many public sector employers such as the Greater London Authority, where mayor Boris Johnson has carried on the work of Ken Livingstone, the devolved administrations and many large local government and civil service employers are paying the living wage.\"</p> <p>The current minimum wage is \u00a36.19 for people aged 21 and over and \u00a34.98 for those aged to 18 to 20.</p> <p>Labour believes that, rather than imposing the living wage in both the private and public sector, employers should be encouraged to adopt the policy voluntarily after seeing the economic and employment benefits. As well as examining how financial incentives through procurement policies could spread the living wage, Labour's policy review is also looking at the possibility of setting up \"Living Wage Zones\" in which employers could be offered transitional help as they move from paying the minimum to a living wage.</p> <p>Another idea being considered is to oblige large employers to make public the proportion of employees on their books who are paid at a rate below the living wage.</p> <p>The independent Resolution Foundation's Commission on Living Standards last week suggested that the law be changed so that all listed companies on the stock exchange have to make clear how many people are paid less than the living wage.</p> <p>Both Ed and David Miliband put the living wage at the heart of their campaigns to lead the Labour party in 2010. Before the last election David Cameron also expressed backing, saying it was a \"good and attractive idea\".</p> <p>On a visit to Islington in north London on Monday to discuss how Labour councils across Britain have succeeded in implementing the living wage, Ed Miliband is expected to describe the living wage as an idea \"whose time has come\". \"The next step is to help more people, including workers in the private sector, have the dignity of earning a living wage. This is one way we can begin building a One Nation economy where prosperity is fairly shared, because it is only by coming together that we can succeed as a country.</p> <p>\"We're looking at a series of ideas as part of Labour's policy review. It's not about making spending commitments, it's about learning from our experience in local government and listening to businesses who tell us how paying the living wage can be the right thing for their business.\"</p> <p>The Institute of Fiscal Studies, in a report two years ago, said that, for every person moved on to the living wage, the saving to the Treasury would be about \u00a31,000 a year. This week the living wage campaign will announce new rates.</p> <p>The list of Labour councils already paying a living wage includes Birmingham, Oxford, Preston and the London boroughs of Hounslow, Lambeth, Camden, Islington, Lewisham, Southwark and Hackney.</p>",
  "<p>Welcome back then the FA Cup, which came clanking out of its cupboard once again on Saturday afternoon, boots dubbined, socks tied, moustache discreetly waxed. A total of 40 first-round ties will have been played by the end of the weekend, among the most notable Preston North End versus Yeovil Town, Hereford versus Shrewsbury \u2013 the A49 derby \u2013 and Crawley Town's trip to Metropolitan Police, who come complete with full-size policeman-style mascot and pre-match blast of I Fought the Law by the Clash.</p> <p>If it is the FA Cup's destiny to arrive every year a little bit like a visit from the grandparents, a favoured dignitary prone to referring constantly to its own much-digested history, this is perhaps understandable. The Cup is routinely described as the oldest cup competition in the world, but even this sells it short. The FA Cup is the fountain-head of the modern game, its birth in 1872 providing the first occasion the FA rules of football were accepted as standard across the board, a take-it-or-leave-it rejection of the violent practice of \"hacking\" and of the public school habit \u2013 Peter Crouch take note \u2013 of propelling the ball towards goal with the hand.</p> <p>Further testimony to this remarkably vivid history will come on Wednesday evening at The Oval, home of Surrey County Cricket Club and also, as it happens, the original home of the FA Cup final. For all its understated urban charm, The Oval is that kind of place, a ground with a tendency to be there on the big occasion: the first cricket Test match in England, the first rugby union international, the first unofficial football international, a 1-1 draw between England and Scotland in 1870 and the venue for the first Cup final in March 1872.</p> <p>It is this occasion that is being commemorated next week, with teams from the two finalists, Wanderers and Royal Engineers \u2013 both of whom still exist in more or less the same form \u2013 staging a rematch. The match will be played in traditional kit but under modern rules, which is good news for those who see some progress in the introduction of the crossbar, goals with nets, the abolition of the need to change ends after each goal scored, and \u2013 something of a shame to lose this one \u2013 the rule stating that the team that gets hold of the ball first gets to take a throw-in.</p> <p>The match is a charity affair organised by Surrey, with profits to the British Royal Legion, Haig Housing Trust and Lambeth Tigers FC. It promises a certain amount of pageantry, with the Band of the Corps of Royal Engineers playing, a rendition of Abide With Me before kick-off and the first ever FA Cup trophy to be presented at the end (it's owned, oddly enough, by David Gold, the West ham co-owner, who will presumably want it back afterwards).</p> <p>Wanderers, victors in that first Cup final, are an interesting story in themselves, a grand old amateur team reanimated five years ago by the club secretary, Mark Wilson, with the intention of reviving a great footballing name for occasions such as these. Trained for the occasion by Bobby Gould, one of the select few to have won the Cup as player and manager, Wanderers will be the underdogs.</p> <p>Royal Engineers do not play in a league as so many of their players are unavailable for long stretches of time due to real life distractions (tours of duty in Afghanistan, that kind of thing) but they play to a decent non-league standard: it seems likely 140 years of hurt may be about to come to an end for the FA Cup's first beaten finalists. Not that Wanderers will go down without a fight, judging by Saturday's training session at Southwark Park, which was punctuated by Gould's motivational barks. \"Go to the corners! Go to the corners!\" he yelled at the man with the ball, before, at one stage stopping practice in order to gather everyone together and shout: \"Why has English football gone soft?\"</p> <p>The game is one thing; for those who luxuriate in the Cup's seductive historical currents, it is also an opportunity to remember the original 1872 competition, for which 15 teams entered, including Hampstead Heathens, a Harrow school old boys' XI and Scotland's champion club of the time, Queen's Park.</p> <p>The competition had its oddities: Wanderers reached the final after winning just a single match in the preceding four rounds. Queen's Park reached the semis without playing at all after a series of walkovers, at which point they exited the competition after a 0-0 draw against Wanderers because they could not afford a second trip to London for the replay.</p> <p>The final was decided by a single goal scored 15 minutes from the end by Morten Betts of Wanderers, playing, for reasons that remain obscure, under the pseudonym AH Chequer. Edmund Creswell of Royal Engineers suffered a broken collarbone but played on regardless for most of the match, a forerunner perhaps of the notorious Wembley Curse that led to players suffer terrible Cup final injuries in the 1950s and 1960s, among them Roy Dwight, Elton John's uncle, who broke his leg at Wembley playing for Nottingham Forest in 1959.</p> <p>The final, for all its lack of goals, was reported as a triumph: a superbly athletic, supremely organised exhibition of what football might yet hope to be. Wanderers were presented with the trophy three weeks later at the Pall Mall restaurant in Charing Cross. After which the Cup began its own journey down the years through the vast crowds that flocked in later years to Crystal Palace, that first Wembley final in 1923, when a policeman on a grey horse helped clear the pitch of spectators and the crowd still thronged the touchline as the match was played, right through the peak years of the 1970s and 1980s when the Cup stood on its own as a competition of unsurpassed prestige.</p> <p>Wednesday's Oval rematch is a chance to remember not just glories past but a little of this story too, football's own progress from the amateur fringes to its current position, noisily centre stage.</p>",
  "<p>\"The marathon is off!\" It was my running mate Gavin, shouting from the other end of the immigration line at JFK airport.</p> <p>\"You're joking,\" I called back, not entirely convinced. And when I saw the look of a man utterly crushed, contemplating the futility of six months of gruelling training, 5am starts, ice baths and long lonely runs, I knew he wasn't having me on.</p> <p>As the news rippled down the line of passengers,&#xa0;most of whom were runners or supporters, there was confusion, tears, anger and disappointment. But right then, I didn't know what to think or feel. I just went cold, and then numb.</p> <p>I had watched the rolling news reports from London of the devastation wreaked by Sandy. I fully expected the marathon would be cancelled \u2013 not just out of respect for those whose lives were affected so tragically, but also just for purely logistical reasons. The images being beamed around the world in the hours after the disaster were of the Manhattan skyline plunged into darkness and subway tunnels filling up with water. It seemed impossible that the city could cope with 40,000 people running through its streets at a time of such chaos.</p> <p>As the days went by and reports of the human cost of the storm began to emerge, my feelings about running became increasingly conflicted. But the New York city mayor, Michael Bloomberg, insisted the marathon would go on, and the word across the Atlantic was that the runners would be welcome. Our presence would help New York overcome this tragedy, and New York would send a message to the world that she was back on her feet. So on Friday morning, with my running mate Gavin and our support team of eight friends, we bundled up our banners and boarded our planes.</p> <p>It's hard to describe to people how much completing this marathon meant to me and everyone else who spent the summer grinding out the miles in training runs.</p> <p>Every runner involved has their own reasons for running and are deeply personal to them. For me, it has been about proving I still can run, after a freak accident last year when I tripped on dry leaves (I've heard all the jokes). It left me on crutches and in intense physiotherapy for five months. It was a huge challenge \u2013 mental and physical \u2013 but I wanted to prove that I could do it.</p> <p>But as I stood in that line at border control, as the reality of the situation dawned, I could not take my eyes off the television screens tuned to cable news, showing footage from Staten Island, the starting point of the marathon. It looked like New Orleans after Katrina. And as I watched the images of wrecked homes and ruined livelihoods, and saw the scale of the loss of life, my personal challenges melted away. How could I have been so selfish even to think of coming?</p> <p>Back in the UK, the level of devastation had not been apparent. Or perhaps it was just being in New York that made it seem more real. But pretty soon it became clear why Bloomberg's decision to press ahead with the marathon had caused such bitter divisions. How could we possibly have gathered to run a marathon, with banners waving and supporters cheering, when just minutes away from us, two young children had been swept from the arms of their mother as she tried to drive them to safety?</p> <p>Obviously I am frustrated by the sacrifices I've made, but they are nothing compared to the losses faced by so many people here. Had the marathon gone ahead, I would have not run. And now that it has been cancelled, pass me a broom \u2013 and show me the way to a bar so I can have my first beer in five months.</p>",
  "<p>We would like to express our concern about the proposal by the mayor of Tower Hamlets to sell the sculpture <a href=\"http://www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk/news/docklands_tug_o_war_with_yorkshire_for_moore_s_old_flo_draped_seated_lady_1_1679846\" title=\"\"><em>Draped Seated Woman</em></a> by Henry Moore. While we understand the financial pressures that Tower Hamlets faces, we feel that the mayor's proposal goes against the spirit of Henry Moore's original sale to London County Council at a favourable price on the understanding that it would be placed in East London.</p> <p>The presence of the sculpture in Stepney was a demonstration of the postwar belief that everyone, whatever their background, should have access to works of art of the highest quality. That is why Moore was so delighted to see the work sited as the centrepiece of a housing estate in London's East End.</p> <p>We appreciate that times have changed and that the costs of protecting the sculpture are demanding, but we believe that there are a number of sites in the borough where the work could be safely placed for the benefit of the community.

All of these have contributed to making family life unaffordable. To blame childcare costs shows a lack of understanding of the level of care young children need to thrive. Carers and early-years educators are undervalued and largely invisible in this debate, which is often monopolised by the professional elite.</p> <p>There's also an assumption that most parents prefer to use childcare rather than do it themselves. Many parents prize time with their children above all else. I'd say a few mornings in pre-school is enough for most young children, then they need to spend time at home.

  "<p><strong>Dundee</strong> finally ended their wait for a home win in the Scottish Premier League with a 1-0 victory against <strong>Hearts</strong>. Matt Lockwood's 20th-minute free-kick was enough to separate the sides as Dundee collected three points as hosts at the sixth time of asking.</p> <p>The <strong>Motherwell</strong> manager, Stuart McCall, praised his players' character after they bounced back from four consecutive defeats in style with a 3-1 victory at <strong>St Johnstone</strong>. Jamie Murphy ended Motherwell's four-game run without a goal when he scored inside 40 seconds of the start after Henrik Ojamaa's shot was blocked.</p> <p>Murphy, playing in a central role off the strikers in the first half, doubled the lead in the 38th minute with a 20-yard strike and Nicky Law burst through to score a third with a chip over the onrushing Alan Mannus in the 73rd minute.

  "<p>The director of the Tate Gallery and an Oscar-winning film director are among leading arts figures <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2012/nov/03/letters-henry-moore-tower-hamlets\" title=\"\">who have written an impassioned letter to the Observer </a>calling on an east London council to abandon plans to sell a masterpiece by Henry Moore, the renowned British sculptor.</p> <p>Gallery director Sir Nicholas Serota and Danny Boyle, who directed <em>Slumdog Millionaire</em> and the spectacular opening ceremony for the 2012 Olympics, are dismayed that the UK may lose <em>Draped Seated Woman</em>, a three-metre-tall bronze sculpted in 1957, because Tower Hamlets council needs the money.</p> <p>The artist \u2013 a miner's son and lifelong socialist \u2013 sold it in 1962 for a price far lower than collectors would have paid on the understanding that the sculpture would be on open-air display to enrich the lives of people in a socially deprived area of London. The 1.6-tonne bronze was on the Stifford housing estate in Stepney until 15 years ago when, because the council had failed to prevent it being daubed with graffiti, it was moved to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park.</p> <p>The sale of such an important work could see bidding reach \u00a320m, the council believes \u2013 which would help it to deal with some of Britain's worst deprivation and a \u00a3100m cut in its budget over the next three years. Although the arts figures acknowledge the council's financial pressures, they argue that disposal of the sculpture \"goes against the spirit\" of Moore's original sale. Their letter states: \"The presence of the sculpture in Stepney was a demonstration of the postwar belief that everyone, whatever their background, should have access to works of art of the highest quality.\"</p> <p>The letter's other signatories include Mary Moore, the artist's daughter, who said: \"It is tragic that this sculpture cannot be enjoyed by the community it was intended for. My father always knew the importance of art sited directly in the community and enhancing the life of that community by its daily presence.\"</p> <p>Serota said: \"It's one of Moore's most important and largest single figures. It was clearly seen by Moore as one of his more important pieces. It is a figure of great dignity and humanity and sums up the utopianism of the postwar era. He sold it on the understanding it was going to be placed in the middle of a public housing development in Stepney. His expectation was that it would stand close to council housing and would therefore be seen by people who lived in council homes and form part of their environment.\"</p> <p>Some art experts question the \u00a320m valuation, which would be a record paid for one of Moore's works. One said that he expected a figure closer to \u00a35m. Commenting on the council's need to slash budgets, Serota said: \"This \u00a320m, if it is as much as \u00a320m, will only make a small contribution to that overall problem. It's a one-off, selling the family silver.\"</p> <p>The council believes that its return to an urban display would make it vulnerable to theft by metal thieves and that it is too valuable to insure. Serota noted that part of the Olympic Park is in Tower Hamlets and could provide a permanent home as the area \"will be very well supervised\", although one observer noted that the amount of money that would have to be spent each year maintaining it might make that solution prohibitive.</p> <p>The artistic quality of more recent public art has been the subject of debate and derision, with Paul Day's <em>The Meeting Place </em>at St Pancras station among artworks that have been criticised. Richard Calvocoressi, director of the Henry Moore Foundation, said: \"It's ironic that something of the quality of Moore's sculpture will not be seen in London again when there has been such a proliferation of third-rate sculptures in central London.\"</p> <p>Ian Leith, of the Public Monuments and Sculpture Association, said dozens of public artworks \u2013 from war memorials to statues \u2013 were neglected while around one a month was stolen. No firm figures exist because there is no audit of the country's public art. Leith added that \"this is the greatest national gallery of all \u2013 which is outdoors \u2013 and it's completely undefined\". No one was accountable, he said.</p> <p>When a Frink or a Moore is stolen, they get publicity, said Leith, but the public is unaware of the plight of \"99.9%\" of the nation's other artworks.</p> <p>Award-winning sculptor, Robert Erskine \u2013 who will show at The Art for Art's Sake Fair in London in December - is taking legal action over a 50-ft-high sculpture commissioned for Peterborough with lottery money. Twelve years on, he says that the sculpture's installation has not been completed and its base is now covered with graffiti. He is so distraught, he even removed his name.</p> <p>Tower Hamlets will make its final decision about Moore's sculpture on Wednesday. A spokesman said: \"Like other councils, we are considering how best to use our assets to generate much-needed funds to invest in local heritage and priority projects.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Premier League's only unbeaten show rolls on. Manchester City are yet to find anything like the rhythm that chewed up sides during the opening of last season, although a hunch is that sometime soon Roberto Mancini's team will teach an opponent a lesson.</p> <p>Not here, though. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/nov/03/manchester-united-arsenal-premier-league\" title=\"\">With Manchester United's win over Arsenal</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/nov/03/swansea-city-chelsea-premier-league\" title=\"\">Chelsea's draw at Swansea</a>, a 4-0 victory over West Ham would have placed City top for the first time this term. Yet by the close, Mancini would have killed for a scrappily fought 1-0, with this result meaning they stay third, two points behind Sir Alex Ferguson's team.</p> <p>Mancini, who will be without Joleon Lescott and James Milner for Tuesday's must-win Champions League visit of Ajax, said: \"We played well. But if we want to win, we've got to score and we missed four, five, six incredible chances. The guys played well and defended well. I'm happy for that performance but not the result.\"</p> <p>Mancini set up his side in what, when the break arrived, had proved a fluid 4-2-1-3. This had Samir Nasri as the conductor behind an attacking trident of Mario Balotelli, Carlos Tevez and Edin Dzeko. Sergio Ag\u00fcero was on the bench alongside Pablo Zabaleta, a right-back who was returning from injury. Kolo Tour\u00e9 was chosen to fill the berth for a first league start since late August, as Lescott's back injury caused him to miss out. After Milner went down with an injured hamstring in the warmup, Gareth Barry also made the XI, playing in tandem with Yaya Tour\u00e9 in a midfield shield that was overrun at times during the opening period.</p> <p>Noting City's weak spot along Kolo Tour\u00e9's corridor, Sam Allardyce was spied early on waving at James Collins to pepper the auxiliary right-back with a high ball for Andy Carroll to feed off. West Ham, who just about shared the opening half, had the ball beyond Joe Hart first but this was ruled offside, perhaps unfairly \u2013 Mark Noble's dinked free-kick having been finished expertly by Kevin Nolan.</p> <p>\"You never know how a game is going to pan out when you score so early,\" Sam Allardyce said: \"But we should have scored and it could have kicked Manchester City up the backside. We believe we scored a perfectly good goal. We want the officials to get the decisions correct.\"</p> <p>City, as is the case so far this campaign, were fluid only in flashes. While at Arsenal, Nasri yearned to play through the middle, although the ambition was stymied by Cesc F\u00e1bregas's presence. Here, with David Silva injured, the onus was on the Frenchman to prompt the visitors and he impressed when doing so. There was a chipped pass to Tevez that West Ham managed to snuff out and, as the half neared its end, a clever ball to Balotelli from which the Italian attempted an acrobatic scissors kick that went wide.</p> <p>City's best move of the half also involved Balotelli. Kolo Tour\u00e9 pinged a pass into Tevez's feet. The forward instantly hit Balotelli, who in turn banged his own first-time ball sweetly into Dzeko's path, which he failed to control. The disappointing Balotelli, who is yet to score in the league, was replaced by Ag\u00fcero in the 69th minute, and Mancini said of his countryman: \"A player like Balotelli when he had a chance like today, he should score. But I don't think he didn't want to [score].\"</p> <p>West Ham were coming off a 2-1 defeat at Wigan. After this visit of the champions, their next sequence reads: Newcastle United, Stoke City, Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool. Of this draw, Allardyce said: \"It gives us hope and confidence. We have a difficult fixture list coming up and this one is the icing on the cake, to get a point against the champions.\"</p> <p>Any spoils had looked unlikely when City occupied home territory at the start of the second half. A Tevez corner that was dropped by Jussi Jaaskelainen was scrambled away, and when West Ham did attack, an agricultural boot of the ball at Carroll in the City area came to nothing when the on-loan Liverpool man was penalised for a foul.</p> <p>\"When the Premier League champions are unbeaten and you play them at home and get a draw, you've got to be happy. Their front four, who all got on at some point, were [worth] about \u00a3150m, so you're going to have to do some defending,\" Allardyce said.</p>",
  "<p>One glance at the list of moderators in the presidential debates told the heads of Univision, the largest Spanish-language television network in the US, that more than 50 million Latinos and their concerns had been ignored, forgotten or, more likely, not even thought about in the first place.</p> <p>So the presenters of the station's influential evening news show, Jorge Ramos and Mar\u00eda Elena Salinas \u2013 icons in the Hispanic community long after news anchors ceased to command the same respect on English-language stations \u2013 issued an on-air call to Barack Obama and Mitt Romney to come to Miami and talk about what matters to the one in 10 voters who speak Spanish.</p> <p>It's a testament to Univision's influence that Obama agreed immediately and Romney was obliged to follow. The ensuing forums \u2013 a mix of audience questions and hard-hitting follow-ups by Ramos and Salinas \u2013 proved a stiffer test for the candidates than any of the debates.</p> <p>Obama was confronted with repeated accusations from the audience and moderators that he broke a promise of comprehensive immigration reform to help the millions of undocumented Latinos in the US. The president was forced into an embarrassing admission that it is the greatest failure of his presidency to date, and that he had been unable to \"change Washington from the inside\".</p> <p>Rightwing talk show hosts, who routinely accuse the mainstream press of giving Obama an easy ride, were delighted he faced a grilling.</p> <p>\"Obama made a promise to our community and he didn't keep it,\" said Isaac Lee, president of Univsion news. \"We could not miss the opportunity to have them there and not ask the questions that need to be asked.\"</p> <p>According to ratings surveys, 72% of Latinos who watch Univision's main evening news broadcast with Ramos and Salinas do not see any other television news. That's unique in the world of cable news, and gives the station unusual influence in the Latino community as well as a different perspective on what its role is.</p> <p>English-language news stations in the US are generally divided by politics \u2013 Fox shouting from the right, MSNBC from the left and CNN floundering for relevance. Lee says Univision eschews a political stand in favour of being a \"voice for the voiceless\" on behalf of the Hispanic community.</p> <p>That means reporting that often drills down into issues largely ignored by English-language media. One recent investigation, into Iranian influence in Latin America, saw <a href=\"http://m.noticias.univision.com/documentales/la-amenaza-irani/article/2011-12-09/la-amenaza-irani?id=786870#axzz2B0PU9ziA\">the Venezuelan consul to Miami deported by the US</a>. Another, into a <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/News/page/univision-news-investigation-operation-fast-furious-weapons-revealed-17352963\">botched federal investigation into gun smuggling</a> that ended up arming Mexican drug cartels, was a severe embarrassment to the Obama administration.</p> <p>Univision election coverage has included tracking down Romney's extended family in Mexico, where the Republican presidential candidate's father was born.</p> <p>\"Romney has a sizeable family in Mexico,\" said Lourdes Torres, head of Univision news election coverage. \"We've been down with them twice already. Nobody else has done that. His family there have a different perspective than him on issues like immigration.\"</p> <p>But the intense focus on issues of interest to the Hispanic community has led to accusations of advocacy journalism, especially when that means politicians are subjected to a level of scrutiny they are not used to from a generally more docile English-language press.</p> <p>Take the flurry of laws in states such as Arizona and Alabama, ostensibly aimed at tracking down undocumented immigrants but which are widely regarded in the Hispanic community as likely to lead to racial profiling, or the recent spate of voter identification legislation, which federal courts have struck down as discriminatory.</p> <p>\"If there's a particular law that's passed, we try to find out who's behind the law, who supports the law,\" said Torres. \"In an electoral context, what are the positions of the candidates on those laws? We would want the viewer to have the right to know the views of the candidates on the issues that are important to them.</p> <p>\"We have a singular role in terms of explaining things to our audience. Sometimes that is interpreted as advocacy because there is more depth. We may point out certain figures or politicians who are supporting or not supporting certain things that do affect the community. Some people may call that advocacy.\"</p> <p>Lee is dismissive of what he describes as the easy way out of \"telling two sides of the story\", so common in US journalism, in which opposing points of view are presented with little insight into who is telling the truth \u2013 because American reporters are so afraid of being accused of bias. Lee paraphrases Elie Wiesel, the Holocaust survivor and writer, as saying neutrality hurts the weak. </p> <p>\"I think it's true that we cannot let go of our responsibility to represent Hispanic people in this country,\" he said. \"There is a very close relationship between Univision and its viewers. They feel Univision is there representing them. It's defending them. This is a disenfranchised community that relies on Univision for a lot of things. I've been very shocked learning from our local stations that people call to ask which doctor to take their kids to, which schools they should go to.\"</p> <p>Univision got into what Lee describes as an \"interesting conversation\" with the New York Times about its use of the word \"illegal\" to described undocumented immigrants. Lee contends that it is dehumanising.</p> <p>\"A person is not illegal. He can do something that is illegal or not. But you are not 'an illegal'. We're very careful about that and we think the Hispanic community here is going through one of those important stages in US history where it's a human rights issue. The same way that people used to use the word homo or nigger and it was acceptable at that time, the word illegal is going to be looked back on with a different perspective,\" he said.</p> <p>The New York Times did not back down, but there was a time when the paper would probably not have felt the need to respond at all.</p> <p>Univision is marking 50th year with plans for a joint venture with ABC for an English-language version of its reporting and is already putting up its content in English on the ABC site. But Torres, who has been with the station since the 1980s, remembers that it was often ignored by politicians.</p> <p>\"You would call and they would say: you are who? You are what?\" she said. \"Now you don't have to explain who we are and what we represent. But I wouldn't say they come running to us.\"</p> <p>What hasn't changed much is that the Hispanic community is frequently viewed as a monolithic block by much of the rest of America. But the complexities of the Latino diaspora in the US present its own problems putting together a news programme for Spanish speakers.</p> <p>The bulk, spread across border states from California to Texas and beyond, are either Mexican-born or of Mexican descent. But there is a sizeable Puerto Rican population dispersed between the island, New York and Florida. Florida is also home to more than one million Cuban Americans, a substantial number of Dominicans and a growing Central American population. </p> <p>\"That's a challenge this network has,\" said Torres. \"To be a Mexican is not Central American, not Guatemalan, not Cuban. There's a language that unifies us but not necessarily one culture that unifies us. I think what does unify us are issues. That we are viewed as a monolithic block also unifies us.\"</p> <p>There are also issues that divide. Torres acknowledged that there was a time when the station had to tread carefully on its coverage of Fidel Castro and Cuba under scrutiny from vocal and sometimes powerful hard line anti-communists in the Cuban American community. But Castro was not viewed with nearly so much hostility by immigrants from some other countries in the region who saw him as championing the poor and standing up to US domination. </p> <p>That, too, has changed. \"The community changed so much. It's not as political among younger generations,\" she said.</p> <p>It's that younger generation that Univision has its eye on. The average age of views of its news programmes are already 10 years younger than English-language cable news. There are about 500,000 Latinos turning 18 every year for the next 10 years in the US. But most of those are bilingual, hence the move into English-language television with a focus on the Hispanic community.</p> <p>\"We need to cater to those who want to hear what we have to say in English,\" said Lee. \"It also helps us get noticed. One of the things that helped us to start being taken seriously by the rest of the media was we started doing things in English, on the web. It's been a major change.\"</p>",
  "<p>The US justice department is scrutinising the conduct of early voting in Florida after people waited for hours in some places to cast a ballot and the state governor, Rick Scott, refused to extend voting beyond Saturday.</p> <p>The justice department said it is monitoring some polling stations to ensure compliance with the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which bars states from placing obstacles in the way of balloting after the Florida legislature cut the number of early voting days in a move Democrats said disadvantaged Barack Obama's supporters. Elections in Florida have attracted particular scrutiny since the 2000 debacle which delivered George Bush into power.</p> <p>As hours-long lines once again formed in some parts of the state for the final day of early voting on Saturday, opinion polls were at odds on how the crucial swing state will decide. <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/content/tampa-bay-times-fla-poll-romney-51-obama-45\">A Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald poll</a> put Mitt Romney six percentage points ahead, 51% to 45%. But an NBC/Wall Street Journal survey gave a small advantage to Barack Obama.</p> <p>The contradictory polls reflected the uncertainty of a heated competition in the state that has seen early voting rise dramatically compared to four years ago and supporters of both candidates saying they voted to keep the other out.</p> <p>But the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald survey also confirmed that many swing voters, particularly Hispanics, have been drawn to Romney by economic desperation and a belief that he will be better able to create jobs.</p> <p>About 3.5 million Floridians had voted early by Friday \u2013 either by post or in person. That's about 30% of the state's electorate and a dramatic increase on 2008 when 2.7 million voted early.</p> <p>About 1.39 million of the early voters are registered Republicans and 1.47 million are Democrats. However, that doesn't necessarily reflect how they voted. Both parties gave differing interpretations of the the figures \u2013 totals of postal voting and people who turned out early in person \u2013 to claim the advantage. What the turnout and long lines at polling stations did clearly show is how strongly some people feel about this election. </p> <p>Michelle Butler, a business manager and Obama supporter, said she was driven to the polls not by the excitement she felt in 2008 but a sense that he has been unfairly treated by Romney and the Republicans. </p> <p>\"I think people are frustrated that the Republicans are blaming Obama even though he's completely turned the economy around,\" she said. \"The Republicans said they would make him a one-term president as soon as he came to power. We saw what happened. They blocked him in Congress instead of putting the country first. People are upset that the Republicans don't play fair.\"</p> <p>Erin O'Brian, a teacher, said she doesn't trust Romney.</p> <p>\"It's all of his flip-flopping. I think people are frustrated. They don't really know who Romney is or what he would do as president. That makes you wonder who would be influencing him. I think people are afraid,\" she said. \"I used to cry listening to Obama speak. But that's not what it's about this time. This is about my daughter's future.\"</p> <p>But many Republicans are excited at the albeit diminishing prospect of removing Obama from power.</p> <p>\"Romney wouldn't be my first choice for president,\" said a petrol station owner, Frank Held, at a Tampa polling station. \"But he's not Obama. That's all that matters now. Three more days and Obama's out. We've waited four years to put right the historic, horrible mistake this country made in electing him.\"</p> <p>As the race enters its final days, both campaigns have saturated key areas of the state with adverts including one from Mitt Romney that says Fidel Castro, Che Guevara and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the left-leaning Venezuelan president, would vote for Obama. The advert includes a sound bite in which Chavez says: \"If I were American, I'd vote for Obama\" and \"If Obama were from [Venezuela], he'd vote for Ch\u00e1vez.\"</p> <p>Castro's niece, Mariela Castro, is seen on video saying: \"I would vote for President Obama.\" She is the daughter of Cuba's present leader, Raul Castro, and a campaigner for gay rights.</p> <p>Florida voters have faced long lines all week to vote early, with some people queuing for five hours, in part because the ballot runs to several pages, with proposed constitutional amendments as well as electing a president, members of Congress and local officials, and it takes a while to fill it out even if people are fully prepared. </p> <p>But Democrats say another reason for the extended lines is that the Republican legislature cut the number of early voting days from 14 to eight to discourage Democrats, who are more likely to vote early, from going to the polling stations. One particularly blatant move was to scrap voting on the last Sunday before election day when many African Americans in Florida traditionally go to the polls after church.</p> <p>But there have been other measures to discourage early voting, or voting at all, some of which have been struck down by the federal courts as blatant discrimination. </p> <p>The League of Women Voters says that the man behind this is the same Republican party official who effectively rigged the 2000 vote in Florida which delivered George Bush into power by a few hundred voters. </p> <p>The league alleges in a lawsuit that the Republican party of Florida's legal counsel, Emmett \"Bucky'' Mitchell IV, wrote the first draft of legislation making it considerably more difficult for groups such as the League of Women Voters to conduct voter registration campaigns and requiring photo identification for voters on the grounds of concern about fraudulent balloting \u2013 a virtually non-existent problem. Both measures were eventually blocked by federal courts. </p> <p>Mitchell was also the man behind the removal of convicted felons from the Florida voters' role in 2000 which led to many innocent people with similar names being deprived of the right to vote. A disproportionate number of them were African Americans, who tend to vote for Democrats. </p> <p>The League of Women Voters said that Mitchell's involvement in the most recent legislation is evidence of a \"partisan agenda to manipulate the voting rules\".</p>",

  "<p><strong>6.18pm: </strong>The last race of the 29th Breeders' Cup did not have any European interest, but what a contest to close proceedings. There was not much for the Europeans to celebrate overall, in fact, with just one winner on each of the two days, but the successes of Rosie Napravnik, on Shanghai Bobby, and above all Wise Dan's victory in the Mile, with a real champion's performance, were also truly memorable. </p> <p>Hope you enjoyed it too. Greg Wood at Santa Anita, signing off. </p> <p><strong>5.53pm: </strong>Both Mucho Macho Man and Fort Larned got a great reception from the crowd as they came back in front of the stands. Mucho Macho Man could not have done any more, and the rest of the field were distant spectators as the two of them went at it, but Fort Larned simply refused to crack.</p> <p><strong>5.46pm: Breeders' Cup Classic result: </strong>1. Fort Larned, 2. Mucho Macho Man, 3. Flat Out. Great stretch duel between the first two but Fort Larned was never headed by the runner-up. Really brave win.</p> <p><strong>5.40pm: </strong>At the gate for the Classic. Hope everyone has enjoyed the day, and that the losers manage to get out of trouble in the last. Though not all of them will, obviously. </p> <p><strong>5.34pm: </strong>There's nothing like the excitement before Zenyatta ran here three years ago of course, but Game On Dude is favourite at 7-5 as he tries to go one better than last year. Mucho Macho Man is 5-1, Flat Out is 7-1, and it is 9-1 bar. Three minutes to post.</p> <p><strong>5.30pm: </strong>Ten minutes to post for the Classic, and here comes Tony Bennett. Sadly, the sound check for Tony seems to have been done by the same person who set up the wifi here yesterday, and no-one can hear anything. Unfortunate, to say the least. </p> <p><strong>5.20pm: </strong>Animal Kingdom ran a huge race in the Mile and and Rafael Bejarano, his jockey, believes it could have been a different story with a little more luck in running. </p> <p>\"They were going so fast early and I was stuck down inside,\" he said. \"I had no choice. Then I had to go in and out of horses. When I finally got to ask him, he gave me a huge kick. I only wish I could have asked him earlier. The winner got first jump on me. If it is the other way around, it might have been a different finish.\"</p> <p><strong>5.09pm: </strong>A cute doggie has just been asked to pick the winner of the Breeders' Cup Classic, live on the big screen. He went for Brilliant Speed, presumably because he liked the name. </p> <p><strong>5.06pm:</strong> Charles Lopresti, the trainer of Wise Dan, is in the interview room. </p> <p>\"Every time I do something with him, he amazes me,\" Lopresti said. \"He's a good shipper, a good horse, he has a good level head, he's just really easy to deal with. </p> <p>\"It really hasn't hit me yet. It's an incredible accomplishment, but it's really just the horse. He's done things in the morning that you just don't believe, and you work all your life to have a horse like this.\"</p> <p><strong>4.45pm: </strong>What a performance by Wise Dan. It was never really in doubt, he travelled supremely well behind the strong pace, charged into the lead at the top of the straight and powered home from there, giving St Nicholas Abbey no chance to launch a response. That was magnificent. </p> <p><strong>4.41pm: Breeders' Cup Mile result: </strong>1. Wise Dan, 2. Animal Kingdom, 3. Obviously. New course record time.</p> <p><strong>4.35pm: </strong>The pace is going to be strong from the start here as Obviously seems sure to set a searching gallop. The trick for the jockeys on the big players will be deciding when to play their hand, as much as finding the room to do it. </p> <p> <strong>4.31pm: </strong>They are on the track for the Mile, all looking well and ready for the challenge. Wise Dan is now the narrow favourite at 9-5, Excelebration still at 2-1. </p> <p><strong>4.28pm:</strong> And so to what is, for the Europeans at least, the race of the meeting: Excelebration and Moonlight Cloud versus Wise Dan in the Mile. Wise Dan and Excelebration are currently trading at 2-1 joint-favourite on the machine, with Moonlight Cloud at 5-1. Animal Kingdom, who is, lest we forget, last year's Kentucky Derby winner, is a 6-1 chance, though he has not seen a racecourse since February. Graham Motion, his British-born trainer, has done brilliantly to get him back to a track at all. Victory would be an extraordinary achievement.</p> <p><strong>4.11pm: </strong>That will have knocked quite a few people out of the Pick6. Trinniberg, an absolute picture of a strong, muscular dirt sprinter, was just under 14-1 on the PMU. </p> <p><strong>4.03pm: Breeders' Cup Sprint result: </strong>1. Trinniberg, 2. The Lumber Guy, 3. Smiling Tiger. </p> <p><strong>3.54pm: </strong>They are out on the track for the Sprint, Amazombie is the narrow favourite in a very open race at 4-1, just ahead of The Lumber Guy at 9-2. Coil is another leading fancy at 5-1, and it's 7-1 about Jimmy Creed. </p> <p><strong>3.43pm: </strong>Shareta in particular was a little slow to stride, while St Nicholas Abbey ran quite wide in mid-division down the back stretch. Little Mike, normally a front-runner, was settled just behind the pace on the rail, but always with plenty of running room. Trailblazer stormed around the outside on the home turn, but his challenge petered out in the stretch and from a furlong out, there was never going to be enough time for the leading Europeans to reel in Little Mike. </p> <p><strong>3.36pm: </strong>Disappointment for the Europeans, but that was a well-judged ride by Ramon Dominguez as Joseph O'Brien, on St Nicholas Abbey, and Christophe Lemaire both struggled to recover from poor early positions. They were charging after the winner down the straight but never looked like getting to him, and it was Point Of Entry who laid down the strongest challenge in the closing stages. </p> <p> <strong>3.23pm: Breeders' Cup Turf result: </strong>1. Little Mike, 2. Point Of Entry, 3. St Nicholas Abbey. </p> <p><strong>3.18pm: </strong>At the gate for the Turf. We have Shareta, St Nicholas Abbey and, ahem, Trailblazer in the Pick6. </p> <p><strong>3.14pm: </strong>Here they come for the Turf, led out by Point Of Entry, the US-trained favourite. St Nicholas Abbey looks very well, so too Shareta. Trailblazer, from Japan, was very fractious in the preliminaries but has consented to join the rest of the field. He has looked several grapes short of the full bunch all week, so all respect to Yutaka Take for just about keeping him under control. I wouldn't want to go within 50 yards of him myself.</p> <p><strong>3.07pm: </strong>Rosie Napravnik is in the interview room. \"He's got so much heart, he just turns it on automatically. It's not something that a lot of horses can do. </p> <p>\"I'm really excited to see how good he gets, because I don't think anybody really knows yet. </p> <p>\"Even when he's a little lost out there I'm trying to encourage him as much as possible, but it's his competitive nature when he sees other horses come up next to him, the heart that he has. He just wants to win.\"</p> <p><strong>2.45pm: </strong>That was an extraordinary race, and a remarkable performance by Shanghai Bobby to see it out all the way to the wire after helping to set some very fast early fractions. Rosie Napravnik, his jockey, got it just right in becoming only the second female jockey to win a race at this meeting, but she looked sure to be swallowed up by the closers halfway down the stretch. Somehow, from somewhere, Shanghai Bobby kept finding more. And did it without the assistance of Lasix, too. </p> <p><strong>2.42pm: Breeders' Cup Juvenile result:</strong> 1. Shanghai Bobby, 2. He's Had Enough, 3. Capo Bastone. </p> <p> <strong>2.30pm: </strong>Coming out onto the track for the Juvenile. Two stand out here on form and in the betting, Shanghai Bobby and Power Broker, and both, happily, are in our still-alive Pick6 perm. Eight of the nine runners are coming off Lasix having run on it last time out, the exception being Fortify, in Godolphin blue for Kiaran McLaughlin. If Fortify wins and the favourites disappoint, the strong pro-Lasix lobby in US racing will use the result as a stick to beat the Breeders' Cup with all the way to next year's meeting. </p> <p><strong>2.22pm: </strong>Mizdirection is owned by Jim Rome, a well-known talk show host on sports radio and Britain's very own Nick Luck has just done a silky-smooth job of presenting him with the trophy. It must have included a big bottle of booze as Luck finished by advising him not to drink it all at once. </p> <p><strong>2.10pm: </strong>What do I know indeed? That's rhetorical, by the way. </p> <p>Mike Smith has just ridden his 17th Breeders' Cup winner, coming with a strong run inside the closing stages to wear down Unbridled's Note. Starspangledbanner showed great early speed, starting quickly under Joseph O'Brien and then tearing to the half-mile in 42.39 seconds, which is really shifting even allowing for the slight downhill gradient. He could not maintain it all the way to the line, but there is still plenty of life left in him yet, in racing terms at least. </p> <p><strong>2.03pm: Breeders' Cup Turf Sprint result:</strong> 1. Mizdirection, 2. Unbridled's Note, 3. Reneesgotzip. </p> <p><strong>1.56pm: </strong>Aidan O'Brien is being interviewed on the big screen in his trademark sunglasses. I've often meant to ask him if he has lots of pairs of identical sunglasses, or whether he is just very good at looking after the one he has. </p> <p><strong>1.52pm: </strong>Starspangledbanner, the July Cup winner who failed to cut the mustard as a stallion, is the European runner here. He has the widest draw, but on Santa Anita's very odd downhill turf sprint track, that's not necessarily a bad thing, as they move to the right not long after the start.</p> <p>It would be one of the finest training performances that even Aidan O'Brien has produced if Starspangledbanner comes back into the winners' enclosure in 10 minutes' time. His form since returning to training does not offer huge encouragement, though, and he is trading at 16-1 on track. </p> <p><strong>1.37pm: </strong>Next up here is the Turf Sprint, which marks the start of the Pick6 bet. I charted the British press corps' romp to success in this bet in a live blog from this very spot four years ago, and while that was surely a once-in-a-lifetime afternoon, that's never likely to stop us trying to make it twice-in-a-lifetime. </p> <p>The Turf Sprint looks a horrible race to start with, though. We've got four runners in the perm, Corporate Jungle, Mizdirection, Unbridled's Note and Reneesgotzip, but it would be no surprise to go out immediately. Personally I'd have taken out Mizdirection and put in the track-and-trip consistency of California Flag instead, but hey, what do I know? </p> <p><strong>1.22pm: </strong>Shackleford's race was as good as over when he stumbled coming out of the stalls. Tapizar was not the most obvious one to benefit, though, as he started at 15-1. Steve Asmussen is the winning trainer, Corey Nakatani the successful jockey.</p> <p><strong>1.18pm: Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile result: </strong>1. Tapizar, 2. Rail Trip, 3. Delegation. </p> <p><strong>1.14pm: </strong>Shackleford was distinctly boisterous in the paddock, though that's pretty much standard. Those such as my good friend and colleague Chris Cook who were concerned for his groom may like to know that he did at least pick up the best turned-out award. </p> <p><strong>1.09pm: </strong>Rajiv Maragh, Groupie Doll's jockey, is talking through the race in the interview room. \"You're the big favourite and expected to win, but you still have to get there. It's never easy until you pass the wire. </p> <p>\"There were several scenarios that could have unfolded. One that I didn't want to see was Dust And Diamonds on an easy lead. When I saw that she wasn't, it let us sit back and be more patient. She's done that all year and now done that on the biggest stage. She is so consistent, she's obviously going to be champion.\"</p> <p><strong>1.05pm: </strong>Apologies for the short break, was writing up a longer report on George Vancouver's win which has now been filed and should be online soon. </p> <p>Here it is 10 minutes to post for the Dirt Mile, with the runners coming out onto the track. Shackleford and Emcee - running for Godolphin's American arm and trainer Kiaran McLaughlin - are the joint-favourites at 5-2. </p> <p><strong>12.40pm: </strong>Very easy for the odds-on favourite, she was midfield behind a blistering pace and then took charge at the top of the stretch. </p> <p><strong>12.38pm: Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare Sprint result: </strong>1. Groupie Doll, 2. Dust And Diamonds, 3. Switch. </p> <p><strong>12.33pm: </strong>Not long to post time in the Filly and Mare Sprint, Groupie Doll is a hot favourite here at 3-5, with Dust And Diamonds next in the betting at 9-2. </p> <p><strong>12.32pm: </strong>O'Brien feels George Vancouver is now in the reckoning for the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket next year, ground permitting. </p> <p>\"He's a very good horse,\" O'Brien said. \"His first two runs [with Joseph O'Brien, his son, riding] were in very bad ground, then Joseph said we should go to DUndalk with him for the fast ground, and he won very easily. We knew that a mile would be fine for him even though he has loads of speed, but [fast] ground was what we were always hoping would make the difference. </p> <p>\"Ryan rode him with real confidence, he had confidence in him from [riding him at] Deauville [in August] and he thought that this race and this track would really suit him.</p> <p>\"We always thought he could be a Guineas horse, ground is vital to him and today he showed that a mile is well within his compass next year, so we're delighted with him.\" </p> <p><strong>12.20pm</strong> Aidan O'Brien and Ryan Moore are in the interview room. </p> <p>\"The pace was quite steady in those races yesterday [the Juvenile Fillies' Turf and Filly and Mare Turf],\" Moore said. \"When you go slow and all the horses are still travelling when you turn in, then it can be harder to find space, but you can make a bit more room when there's a bit more pace in the race. </p> <p>\"I had a very smooth race, that's what you need in these sort of races. You need a bit of luck and things to work out for you and we had that today.\"</p> <p><strong>12.02pm: </strong>Good ride by Ryan Moore to take the Juvenile Turf on Aidan O'Brien's George Vancouver, though it could be said that the only real difference between Moore's performance and those of Richard Hughes and William Buick on Friday was that he got a bit of luck. George Vancouver was travelling ominously well on the home turn, but was stuck on the rail just like Sky Lantern and The Fugue here yesterday. Halfway down the stretch, though, as James Doyle launched Dundonnell down the outside, Moore found a gap at just the right moment and grabbed his chance. George Vancouver quickened smartly, and though Noble Tune tried to run him down, Moore was not coming back. </p> <p>The winner paid around 9-1 on the local PMU. Moore has just returned past the stands to the winner's enclosure, and from the look on his face, you wouldn't be able to tell whether he'd just won a seller at Brighton or, as is actually the case, a race with a seven-figure purse.</p> <p><strong>11.53am: Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf result: </strong>1. George Vancouver, 2. Noble Tune, 3. Balance The Books. </p> <p><strong>11.50am: </strong>Post time for the Juvenile Turf. Here we go for day two of the 29th Breeders' Cup. Good luck to all, particularly the jockeys trying to weave their way around the tight inner turf track. </p> <p><strong>11.46am: </strong>They all looked pretty composed in the preliminaries, the sun is pretty high in the sky now but it's not quite as hot as it has been for some previous Breeders' Cups here. There's a big crowd in Santa Anita's magnificent 1930s grandstand, and the atmosphere is really building. </p> <p><strong>11.44am: </strong>They are out on the track for the first Breeders' Cup race, the Juvenile Turf. US-based Noble Tune is the narrow local favourite in the on-track betting, but most of the European challengers are relatively strong in the market. Dundonnell is 5-1, Artigiano is 7-1, George Vancouver is 9-1 and Fantastic Moon is 13-1. </p> <p><strong>11.27am:</strong> We are now about 20 minutes away from the first Breeders' Cup race, still no scratches, and just time to thank the very excellent Jay Hovdey (a good man to follow on Twitter via @JayHovdey) for helping me to fill in a piece of my past. </p> <p>Jay very kindly borrowed the Santa Anita form book from the main press room for me, as a result of which I can now say with certainty that my first trip to a racecourse anywhere in the world was on 18 October 1973, when I was eight years old. </p> <p>I was in California on holiday, my dad was a racing fan and booked tickets for Santa Anita, and I've always been able to remember the names of the horses he backed for me. Two minutes with the form book, and there they were: Moolah's Memory, an 80-1 chance that finished second-last, and Kings Flier, another outsider, who finished second and got me a chunky place dividend (which I spent on a new fishing reel).</p> <p>Jay, it turns out, would have been up in the press box that day as it was his first year out of college and he was just starting his career in racing. Thirty-nine years later, we're both here again, looking forward to another afternoon of action at this wonderful track. </p> <h2>Day two starts here<br></h2> <p><strong>11.15am: </strong>It was a little before 8am when I arrived at Santa Anita racecourse this morning ahead of the second and most significant day of the Breeders' Cup meeting and I can think of only one occasion in about 20 years as a racing reporter when I've turned up at a track on a raceday any earlier than that. It was the Leopardstown Christmas meeting about eight years ago, the only flight I could get due to the festive rush was at about 5am from Gatwick and I got off the Aircoach at Leopardstown at about 7.15am. As I walked up to the track, it started to snow. It was freezing cold, I seemed to be the only person alive within 10 miles of the course, never mind awake, and I felt very, very alone.</p> <p>Which makes for something of a contrast with Santa Anita, where it is warm and cloudless, and there were plenty of people apparently onto their third or fourth beer of the morning by the time I turned up. The first race on the card here is at 10.05am local time and the first Breeders' Cup race, the Juvenile Turf with <strong>Dundonnell</strong>, <strong>George Vancouver</strong>, <strong>Artigiano </strong>and <strong>Lines Of Battle </strong>going for Europe, is at 11.50am local, which is 18.50pm GMT.</p> <p>There are nine races on the card in all, culminating in the $5m Classic at 00.35am GMT, but the climax from a European perspective will be the preceding Mile, at 23.40pm GMT. <strong>Excelebration</strong>, so often the supporting act to Frankel but a top-notch miler in his own right, goes for Aidan O'Brien while <strong>Moonlight Cloud</strong> represents Freddy Head, who won this race three times as a trainer with Goldikova and twice as a jockey on Miesque. <strong>Wise Dan</strong>, the best horse in north American on any surface according to Timeform, is the obvious danger.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/nov/02/excelebration-find-rival-breeders-cup\" title=\"Guardian tips\">Tips for today's racing can be found here</a> and a feature on the Breeders' Cup's decision to ban the use of the anti-bleeding drug Lasix from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/nov/02/breeders-cup-lasix-dopey-idea\" title=\"Guardian feature\">the two-year-old races this year, and all the races next year, is here</a>.</p> <p>There are no non-runners as yet in the Breeders' Cup events, the main track is officially <strong>fast</strong>, while the turf course is <strong>firm</strong>.</p> <p>Everything seems in place for a great day's racing, in fact, at the most international event of the season. I even managed to sweet-talk the server at the Clocker's Corner canteen into making me a bacon-and-egg sandwich five minutes after it had officially closed, which takes some doing. \"OK, English,\" she said as she finally caved in. \"I wouldn't want you telling the Queen on me, would I?\"</p> <p>The best news of all is that a password-protected wifi network called \"<em>Media</em>\" appeared on my list five minutes ago, which isn't working yet but might just mean that the farcical scenes of Friday may not be repeated this afternoon. Grown men and women were weeping into their keyboards with frustration as they tried to file blogs and copy to media organisations around the world using Santa Anita's open, public wifi network.</p> <p>It did not seem to have occurred to anyone at the Breeders' Cup that, with every smartphone in every spectator's pocket trying to log itself on to this network automatically, it might prove difficult for us workers to do the same.</p> <p>If \"<em>Media</em>\" comes to the rescue, I'll be firing updates into this blog from around an hour before the first race as fast as my fingers (and print deadlines) allow. I'll try to push the button on 1-2-3s within 15 seconds of confirmation \u2013 beat that, Racing Post \u2013 and get quotes from connections and so on online direct from the interview room where possible.</p> <p>If we end up back on <em>SA_Public_Wifi</em>, the agent of Friday's misery, then all bets are off.</p> <p>Let's hope it doesn't come to that.</p>",
  "<p>Next week the mayor of the London borough of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, will decide on the future of a major work of art in the council's possession. He has already declared <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/oct/03/henry-moore-sculpture-tower-hamlets?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">his intention to sell it</a>, but he will have to consider the views of the council's overview and scrutiny committee, which is meeting on Tuesday.</p> <p>The work is Henry Moore's <em>Draped Seated Woman</em>, and the proposal is to sell it to the highest bidder, to fill some of the gap, they say, made by government spending cuts. Councillor Shahed Ali, one of Rahman's cabinet members, told the BBC that \"we'd love to keep it in the borough\", but it is \"uninsurable\", at a time when large bronzes like this are sometimes stolen for their scrap value.</p> <p>The proposal has aroused the fury of, among others, Henry Moore's daughter Mary, the local MP Rushanara Ali, and Danny Boyle, hero of the Olympic opening ceremony. In a letter to the <em>Observer </em>today, they write that it \"goes against the spirit\" of Henry Moore, who sold it to London County Council at a price \u2013 \u00a36,000 \u2013 far below its then market value. It demonstrated the \"belief that everyone, whatever their background, should have access to works of art of the highest quality\".</p> <p>Moore, they say, was \"delighted\" that it was installed as the centrepiece of the Stifford estate, a group of tower blocks in Stepney. Boyle says that \"it represents everything I believe in\". He and his fellow objectors are right: <em>Draped Seated Woman </em>fulfils an ideal that nothing was too good for ordinary people, an ideal that modern local politicians are in danger of losing. To sell the sculpture as if it were a piece of real estate would be, according to Rushanara Ali, \"a betrayal of working class heritage\". It would also betray Moore's generosity. It would raise the question why anyone should ever want to offer anything to a local authority again.</p> <p>The piece itself, which acquired the nickname Old Flo, is noble and touching. It is 3 metres high and weighs 1.6&#xa0;tonnes, but there is still a lightness with which the figure of the woman sits on a low plinth, delicacy in the fall of drapery on her body, and a springy alertness in her pose. It is beautifully made. Placed amid tower blocks, it was a rare moment of quality, a sign that someone cared. It was also accessible \u2013 children could play on and around it, and residents could see it from their kitchens. No doubt it was inscrutable to some, and uninteresting to others, but as long as it was there it created the possibility that some might be inspired, intrigued, or provoked into seeing the world in a different way.</p> <p>It sat on the Stifford until 1997, when the estate was demolished and the sculpture was moved to <a href=\"http://www.ysp.co.uk/page/about-ysp/es\" title=\"\">Yorkshire Sculpture Park</a>, allegedly temporarily. It has remained there ever since, while plans have come and gone to, for example, relocate it to Canary Wharf. Lutfur Rahman has tried to sell it once before, when he was leader of the council, but was stopped. Now, with the greater powers of an elected mayor, he is trying again.</p> <p>In a time of cuts, in a poor area, there is force to the argument that the money could be spent on something more directly useful to the people of Tower Hamlets. Except that, taken to its extreme, it could be used to cut off all cultural funding whatsoever. The Whitechapel Gallery could be sold to Tesco, to raise money for deserving causes, houses could be built on parks and various council-funded embellishments to the streets of the borough should never have happened. The Olympics, supported by Tower Hamlets, should \u2013 by this logic \u2013 certainly have been stopped.</p> <p>Worse, there is no guarantee that the proceeds of sale will go directly to needy residents. Rahman has not said where it will go, except somewhere in the council's billion-pound-a-year budget. Labour councillor Josh Peck, who is opposing the move, claims this is \"effectively a fire sale caused by the appalling financial deficit\" brought on by the \"profligacy and quite extraordinary waste\" of the current administration. He gives me details \u2013 \u00a31m a year on <em>East End Life</em>, a \"newspaper\" publishing stories favourable to the council; expenditure on banners with the mayor's face on it; a chauffeur-driven Mercedes for his use; on advisers and consultants.</p> <p>Without going fully into debates about Tower Hamlets' spending policies, there is sufficient doubt that the proceeds of Old Flo would really go where they are needed most. As Peck says: \"The challenge for Tower Hamlets is revenue funding. This is a one-off piece of capital funding. It's only a stop-gap measure, and the people of Tower Hamlets will have lost an asset for ever.\" He says: \"There is a debate to be had but at present it's a dishonest one. The sculpture should not be sold just because the mayor wants to do it.\"</p> <p>The sculpture's value has been reported to be \u00a320m. This price, though obviously not small, would not make that much difference to the council's budgets. Especially if, as it should be, the capital sum is annualised into a yearly revenue figure of a few per cent of the total value \u2013 it wouldn't do much more than pay for <em>East End Life</em>, the banners and the Merc.</p> <p>It also turns out that the claim that it is \"uninsurable\" is wrong. Queen Mary college, which is in the borough, has offered to put Old Flo in a publicly accessible place, and has been quoted a premium of \u00a32,000 by its insurers subject to some security requirements. Since councillor Shahed Ali wrung his hands over this insurmountable problem, and as Queen Mary college seems to have solved it for him, it is surely time for him to come good on his claim that he'd \"love\" to keep it in Tower Hamlets. He can.</p> <p><em>To sign a petition to save Old Flo, go to </em><a href=\"http://www.change.org/petitions/lutfur-rahman-independent-mayor-of-tower-hamlets-keep-old-flo-in-tower-hamlets?utm_campaign=petition_created_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=guides\" title=\"\"><em>http://goo.gl/b2IM0</em></a></p>",

While we could have, we didn't count the frequent minor jabs, but focused on the more monumental statements that wound their way into every speech. </p> <p>If you showed up at one of the candidates' recent campaign stops, here's what you have expected to hear \u2013 often verbatim.</p> <p></p> <h2>Obama's greatest hits from the trail</h2> <p></p> <p>Despite having taken time off from campaigning this week to deal with his actual <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/30/obama-sandy-aftermath-campaign\">presidential duties after superstorm Sandy</a>, here's what president Obama has been telling his rally-goers over the past month. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\" id=\"blue\"> <p>I will say it again \u2013 the path I'm offering is not quick or easy. But it leads to a better place.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\" id=\"blue\"> <p>I want to end tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas, give them to companies that are investing and creating jobs right here in the United States of America.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\" id=\"blue\"> <p>I want to cut our oil imports in half by 2020 so we control more of our own energy.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\" id=\"blue\"> <p>The last thing we can afford, [insert battleground state name], right now is four years of the very same policies that led us into the mess in the first place.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\" id=\"blue\"> <p>I also want to make sure that our kids and our workers are better trained than everybody else. We've got to make this a national mission. I want to recruit 100,000 math and science teachers to make sure our kids are at the cutting edge. I want to train 2 million workers at community colleges so they have the skills for the jobs that are there right now and the jobs of the future. I want to work to make sure that colleges and universities keep tuition down so our young people aren't burdened with debt.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\" id=\"blue\"> <p>[Insert battleground state name], we cannot grow this economy from the top down. This economy grows from the middle out, when everybody has ladders of opportunity; if they work hard they can succeed, they can get ahead. That's how we move ahead.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\" id=\"blue\"> <p>I want to reduce our deficit by $4tn, but I want to do it in a balanced way. We'll cut out spending we don't need, but I'm going to ask the wealthiest Americans to pay a little bit more so we can invest in the research and technology and infrastructure that keeps new jobs and businesses coming to America. </p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\" id=\"blue\"> <p>I will never, under the guise of reducing the deficit, turn Medicare into a voucher </p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\" id=\"blue\"> <p>I'll use the savings from ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to put people back to work doing some nation-building here at home rebuilding our roads and our bridges, our broadband lines in the rural areas, fixing our schools up.

I don't think your boss or your insurance company should be making those decisions for you either. I believe women are capable and should make their own healthcare decisions for themselves. </p> </blockquote> <h2>Romney's greatest hits from the trail</h2> <p>Mitt Romney has been touting his \"five-point plan\" for the long haul, but over the last few weeks he has doubled-down, referring to his five steps to economic recovery at every rally opportunity. From taking advantage of all of America's natural resources \u2013 <em>all of them</em> \u2013 to giving a leg up to small businesses, here are his top lines while on the campaign trail. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We're going to take advantage of our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We're going to open up new markets for trade \u2026 I will open up trade particularly in Latin America to get more good jobs in this country.

It is even more to Hibs's credit that they recovered from a goal behind.</p> <p>Once again, Leigh Griffiths provided the inspiration. One of Fenlon's key tasks in the coming weeks is to ensure the temporary deal with Wolves for the 22-year-old is at least extended if not made permanent. Here, Griffiths scored two, hit the woodwork twice and had another \"goal\" ruled out for offside.</p> <p>James McPake, the Hibs captain, said: \"Wolves must have some top strikers if he's not good enough to have a chance. Their loss is definitely going to be somebody else's gain, I just hope it's ours. If somebody in England takes a gamble on him that's entirely up to Leigh but Hibs is where his heart is.\"</p> <p>Improvement at Hibs has to be considered in two separate contexts. First, the SPL is not of such general strength that scintillating form is required to emerge from the pack chasing Celtic. Coming into this game, Hibs had taken 18 points from 11 league outings, hardly an awesome achievement.</p> <p>Yet Hibs' generally shambolic state in recent times, including last season when they flirted once again with relegation and were demolished in the Scottish Cup final, means Fenlon is due credit for making a positive impact. A clutch of managers before him had toiled to oversee likewise.</p> <p>Should Hibs achieve European football at the end of this campaign, Fenlon can point to the kind of progress the club have been crying out for. The Scottish game, too, benefits from a strong Hibs, given the support they can attract.</p> <p>Hibs' early season touch is due in no small part to the influence of the on-loan Griffiths. He has the kind of pace and eye for goal that should render him a candidate for a Scotland callup, even if the questions regarding his attitude that have dogged the forward since he emerged at Livingston seemingly undermine his candidature.</p> <p>Griffiths was allowed to leave Wolves after using his Twitter account to point out he \"couldn't be bothered\" on the first day of pre-season training. Intriguingly, though, the Midlands club had representation at Easter Road for St Mirren's visit.</p> <p>By the time Griffiths claimed a 10th goal of the campaign \u2013 and seventh in six games \u2013 Hibs were already one behind.</p> <p>St Mirren had opened as the brighter side, with Steven Thompson wasting a glorious opportunity to send them ahead after 13 minutes. Kenny McLean was later denied by the smart reactions of Ben Williams in the Hibs goal. In between those chances, Griffiths had struck the inside of a post after seizing on indecision in the visiting defence.</p> <p>McLean was to offer a more decisive intervention. The young midfielder picked up a loose ball, 25 yards from goal, and struck a fine left-foot shot past Williams.</p> <p>Paul Cairney was the architect of Hibs's leveller. The former Partick Thistle player engineered time and space for himself on the left flank, before offering a cross that McPake only narrowly failed to meet. Instead, Griffiths was lurking at the back post to supply an angled finish.</p> <p>The second half had lacked fluency before a two-minute spell that inflicted fatal damage on St Mirren. Griffiths scored his second with a low drive from 18 yards, thereby displaying the kind of timely potency that any team would value.</p> <p>Moments later, St Mirren were denied the services of their captain, Jim Goodwin. The midfielder, earlier booked for a late tackle, received a second yellow card for a body check on David Wotherspoon.</p> <p>Griffiths lashed a free-kick off the goal frame as Hibs sought to close out victory. A one-goal margin was ultimately sufficient.</p>",
  "<p>Rebel groups are accusing Syria's military council of infighting and nepotism and a failure to lead in the wake of a video that shows an opposition unit killing around two dozen captured regime soldiers.</p> <p>Armed opposition units across the Aleppo hinterland say the western-backed council is failing in its bid to create a co-ordinated opposition army, partly because of its refusal to deal with Islamist-leaning Syrian groups.</p> <p>The groups say the military council's favouritism towards some units means other militias are unwilling to act with discipline or to be held accountable. The disturbing scenes of the captured regime troops being killed, shortly after their post near Damascus was overrun, have angered rebel units in the north.</p> <p>\"We have to show we are different from the regime,\" said Sheik Omar Othman from the Islamist-leaning Liwat al-Tawheed unit in Aleppo. \"Because they do it, it means that we don't.\"</p> <p>Syrian Islamist groups have been at the vanguard of the fighting in Aleppo for the past three months, but are not able to match the better-armed and funded global jihadist units, who are increasingly taking centre stage in the war for the north of the country.</p> <p>\"This will soon mean that Jabhat al-Nusraf (an al-Qaida-aligned group) will be the only group capable of mounting the lethal operations on bases and security headquarters,\" said a leader of Liwat al-Tawheed, which has been a key player in the fighting in Aleppo. \"It already means that we can't win without them.\"</p> <p>Islamist groups in Aleppo say that they aim to do no more than oust the Assad regime. Most of their clerics and leaders reject the ideology of the jihadists, who openly view the battle in Syria as a vital phase of a global sectarian war.</p> <p>With Aleppo effectively locked in stalemate since mid-August, commanders from Liwat al-Tawheed and other units in and around Syria's second city have been travelling to near the Turkish border to meet military council leaders. \"They say, 'join us, or we won't give you anything',\" said Othman. \"We are not opposed to doing that if it means that we get a share of the weapons that they are distributing.</p> <p>\"But their aim is to keep everything away from us. That's a problem when we're doing the fighting.\"</p> <p>The military council is comprised of defected senior officers who have until recently remained in exile in a refugee camp in southern Turkey. They have access to weapons, sourced primarily from Qatar, and to funds from across the Sunni Arab world.</p> <p>Under pressure from the Obama administration, some military council officers have since established a small base just across the Turkish border and are attempting to form a centralised command and control structure to unite the deeply fragmented rebel groups.</p> <p>One of the council's senior officers, Brigadier Mustafa Sheikh, travels frequently to Idlib province, warning communities against supporting Islamists. Another officer regularly offers the same warning near Azaz in Aleppo province.</p> <p>US secretary of state Hillary Clinton last week also reiterated a warning to rebel groups to be careful from whom they accept help.</p> <p>The pleas appear to be falling on deaf ears. \"Tell the Americans 'thanks for the binoculars',\" said an Aleppo rebel leader, Haji Tal-Rifat.</p> <p>Islamist and non-Islamist rebel leaders here say that they are being forced to accept the help of the highly motivated jihadist groups, the predominantly Syrian Jabhat al-Nusraf, and the foreigner group known as al-Muhajirin, because no other assistance is coming their way.</p> <p>Foreign fighters who embrace the al-Qaida worldview are increasingly travelling to Aleppo province, where they are forming training camps and leadership groups and are readily joining the front lines. The foreigners are also taking increasingly prominent fighting positions in non-jihadist units, which claim to be continually low on weapons and ammunition.</p> <p>Rebel officers interviewed by the <em>Observer</em> over the past week say that few recent large attacks against the Syrian military or regime targets have taken place without the presence of several al-Muhajirin members.</p> <p>\"They are fighting here and they are dying here,\" said one rebel officer. \"Sometimes we don't even know their names when we bury them, because they give us an alias when they arrive.</p> <p>\"I know we are playing with fire,\" he said. \"But tell me, what would you do if you were in my position?\"</p> <p>Another Liwat al-Tawheed commander said enough ammunition was arriving from Turkey to keep the battle going, but not enough to win it.</p> <p>\"Compare what we have to what al-Nusraf are getting. They are not getting weapons from outside, but they are buying them in Syria with large amounts of cash. They are very well supplied and they are not saying where they are getting the money from.\"</p>",
  "<p>Three US states are set to legalise recreational cannabis use this week in votes that could have major implications for the country's war on drugs.</p> <p>Alongside their choice for president, residents of Washington, Oregon and Colorado \u2013 a swing state \u2013 will be asked on Tuesday whether they want to decriminalise cannabis.</p> <p>If the measures are passed, adults over 21 would be able to possess, distribute and use small amounts. Cannabis for authorised medical use is already permitted and regulated by each state, even though it is against federal law.</p> <p>Support is particularly strong in Washington and Colorado, but a \"yes\" vote in any of the states would be interpreted by the Department of Justice as an act of defiance against the federal government's war on drugs \u2013 the national law enforcement programme that spends $44bn a year struggling to stem the tide of illegal drugs in the US.</p> <p>In June 2011, however, the Global Commission on Drug Policy declared that the war on drugs had failed.</p> <p>In a swing state such as Colorado, putting the liberal measure on the ballot could even help to keep the battleground state \u2013 narrowly won for Barack Obama in 2008 \u2013 on the president's side. Obama has taken a soft line on medical cannabis use.</p> <p>If recreational use is approved, a new drug industry would inevitably boom and the states expect a tax bonanza from the income generated. Colorado plans to spend the first $40m a year on schools, although the state's largest teachers' union is firmly against legalisation. A yes vote would allow the possession and private use of up to an ounce of cannabis, but it would not be legal to smoke a joint in the street. \"But that's already what people do here anyway, so it won't make any difference. Anyone who's been to a concert in this state will know no one's arrested for pot,\" said Laura Chapin, who runs the \"no\" campaign in Colorado. Denver and the ski town of Breckenridge decriminalised cannabis for private recreational use in 2005 and 2009 respectively. Chapin, who is a Democrat, admitted she had not heard of any dramatic ill effects as a result, but said legalising it statewide was a different matter: \"It effectively establishes Colorado as the cannabis capital of the United States. And it will increase access to the drug for our kids.\"</p> <p>In another political irony, John McKay, a Republican and former US attorney in Washington, is campaigning for a yes vote. Criminalisation of cannabis had been \"an abject failure\", he said, adding that \"millions and millions of Americans\" illegally smoke cannabis, with the proceeds going to illegal cartels. McKay believes that controlling a legal trade would make it safer.</p> <p>Several former senior police officers have also come out in favour. However, operators of medical cannabis dispensaries are divided. Some believe it would ease the taboo around pot, while improving quality. Others fear a threat from new competition or from the federal government blocking the law and launching a wider crackdown.</p> <p>\"I think the federal government will stop us all in our tracks by taking the states straight to court, which will hurt the medical community,\" said Michael Perry, owner of the Sea Weed medical dispensary in Seattle.</p> <p>Tom Tancredo, a former Colorado Republican congressman, argues that prohibition of alcohol did not work in the 1920s \u2013 consumption flourished, as did violence and extortion. He said: \"Cannabis can be used safely and responsibly by adults. Limited law enforcement resources should not be wasted on this, they should be used on preventing crimes that harm others.\"</p>",
  "<p>No controversy here, but no win for Chelsea either, Swansea City rallying with spirit and conviction to score an 88th-minute equaliser that leaves Manchester United in pole position in the Premier League.</p> <p>United took over at the top of the table earlier in the day by beating Arsenal, and Chelsea were unable to reply in kind. They were denied the win they needed by Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez, the striker Swansea signed from Valencia last summer, who beat Petr Cech with a laser-guided 20-yarder. Remarkably, after Chelsea had been the better team for much of the game, the Swans might have nicked it at the end, when Danny Graham, on as substitute, was desperately close with a shot that shivered the framework of Cech's goal.</p> <p>After recent events the focus was as much on the referee as the players. Kevin Friend, of Leicestershire, will have prayed for a routine assignment, or at least one free of dialogue with Mikel John Obi. To his relief, he got what he wanted. When Mikel was booked, for fouling Jonathan De Guzman, there was no drama. To universal relief, the football was good, constructive stuff, free of histrionics and post-match accusations. Roberto Di Matteo made a point of praising the referee. The Chelsea manager said: \"I've got to say the officials were very good. Kevin Friend did very well, he kept the players calm. I congratulated him at the end.\"</p> <p>Asked if he had told his team to behave impeccably in light of the storm after last Sunday's defeat by Manchester United, he said: \"No, I didn't think it was necessary to do that. In general, their behaviour is good.\"</p> <p>Both teams were without important players. Injury has deprived Swansea of Michel Vorm, one of the best goalkeepers in the league, and Chico Flores at centre-half. Chelsea had John Terry completing his suspension and another of their old guard, Frank Lampard, plus David Luiz and their player of the season to date, Juan Mata, all casualties.</p> <p>Opportunity knocked for Garry Monk, the Welsh club's long-serving club captain, who will have enjoyed his first appearance of the season in the Premier League as Flores' deputy. Chelsea's most interesting selection was Victor Moses, who caught the managerial eye in the midweek cup victory over Manchester United, and justified his inclusion as Mata's deputy by scoring with a header after an hour.</p> <p>Chelsea had the better of the first half in terms of possession and chances created, their best goal attempt seeing a header from Fernando Torres cleared off the line by Leon Britton after a corner taken on the left by the man of the match, Eden Hazard. For a long time Swansea, as is their custom, played some lovely, cohesive football, but without seriously inconveniencing Cech. Chelsea ought to have scored after 50 minutes, when Torres delivered an inviting cross from near the byline on the left, only for his work to be wasted when Moses headed weakly over the bar from six yards. The young winger quickly made amends.</p> <p>Chelsea's chance seemed to have gone when Gerhard Tremmel flew to his left to turn behind a curling 25-yard free-kick from Hazard, but from the corner Gary Cahill's header reached Moses who, at the near post, headed in at close range, via the top of the upright. Michael Laudrup sent on Nathan Dyer and Graham and switched to 4-2-4 in search of renewed equality, and boldness had its reward when Itay Shechter, on as substitute, supplied Hern\u00e1ndez, who ran on before shooting into the left corner of Cech's net.</p> <p>Di Matteo, naturally, was disappointed to have his team knocked off the top for the first time since the table meant anything. He said: \"After the week we've had, it would have been good to finish it off with a 1-0 victory. We had more of the game and they didn't create many chances but we lacked a cutting edge today. All right, we're not top any more but it's only November and it's a long season. We're in touch and we're going to show how strong we are in the future.\"</p> <p>He admitted it was nice to be talking about football rather than discipline and off the field events. \"That's how it should be every week,\" he said. \"I wish it was.\"</p> <p>Asked if recent controversies had adversely affected his team's form, Di Matteo said: \"I wouldn't read anything into all that. Away games in the Premier League are always difficult.\"</p> <p>Chelsea expect to have Mata, fit again in time for Wednesday's Champions League tie at home to Shakhtar Donetsk. Terry will be available but Di Matteo will assess his match fitness before deciding if he plays.</p>",

Tottenham were knocked out of the League Cup by Norwich on Wednsday and one of the curiosities of their Premier League campaign so far is that they began this weekend in the top four having played well only in patches. They have not put two dominant halves together all season, except perhaps when winning at Reading in September. Their first hour here was insipid and the improvement was only marginal after Watson's goal. Even before that strike they were lucky to reach the break on level terms, the visitors having failed to take advantage of three clear chances.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50954c5d95cb1506d24447ca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-03T16:54:53.961Z\">4.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>And more boos at White Hart Lane as Wigan stun Spurs 1-0.</strong> That's a great result for Wigan who, more than any other lower-tier side, seem to be capable of beating the big teams on their day.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50954c15b579f74bac7649bb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-03T16:53:41.839Z\">4.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Loud boos at the Stadium of Light as Aston Villa beat Sunderland 1-0.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50954c01b579f74bac7649ba\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-03T16:53:21.557Z\">4.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It's finished at Carrow Road:</strong> Norwich 1-1 Stoke</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50954ba295cb1506d24447c9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-03T16:51:46.692Z\">4.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It's finished at the Liberty Stadium: Swansea 1-1 Chelsea.</strong> Swansea deserved that ...</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50954b4a95cb1506d24447c8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-03T16:50:18.343Z\">4.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Meanwhile a shock in the first round of the FA Cup:</strong> Swindon 0-2 Macclesfield.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50954b30b579f74bac7649b9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-03T16:49:53.150Z\">4.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TimothyAbraham/status/264770317036175361\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Heavy pressure from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23SAFC\">#SAFC</a> in search of the equaliser.

  "<p>A plan to relax planning constraints on phone masts and overhead cables being erected across Britain's most protected countryside has been described by campaigners as the biggest attack on national parks and areas of outstanding beauty in more than 50 years.</p> <p>Ministers are to be allowed to prioritise the expansion of broadband and 4G into rural areas over the need to maintain the splendour of cherished countryside, when it comes to sites for telecoms networks. The move, contained in a bill to be debated in parliament in the coming weeks, has been savaged as an assault on the laws that first gave national parks and beauty spots their protected status under Clement Atlee's Labour government in 1949.</p> <p>It is feared that the Lake District landscapes that inspired William Wordsworth will be particularly under threat. Sir Andrew Motion, the former poet laureate and president of the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England, is understood to be involved in a private lobbying campaign against the changes. The English National Park Authorities Association (ENPAA), representing the government-funded bodies stewarding the parks, including the Lake District, has expressed its alarm.</p> <p>The government hopes that removing the duty of the secretary of state to take into account the beauty of an area will help push the expansion of broadband and 4G and stimulate growth. But a leaked internal document produced by the ENPAA, spelling out the concerns it has raised with ministers, says that it believes the change is \"unnecessary for the purposes of securing improved infrastructure and economic growth in national parks\".</p> <p>The document warns ministers of an outcry once the change becomes public. It adds: \"We have seen no evidence that national park purposes have unduly hampered broadband or mobile communications delivery or justification for such a change to well-established legislation, and reject the inference that national park status has been a barrier to the roll-out of mobile/broadband technologies.</p> <p>\"Parliament has established national parks with a clear purpose to protect their landscapes, wildlife and heritage and it is not appropriate to pick and choose when such protection should be afforded, and when not.</p> <p>\"[It] is likely to give rise to a public reaction. This is likely to come in particular from concern about the government's commitment to landscape protection.\"</p> <p>Following campaigning from Friends of the Lake District, an agreement was recently struck between the parks and the electricity companies to remove around 12 miles of unsightly cables from parks at a cost of \u00a32 million. Campaigners fear the latest plans for parks will undo that work.</p> <p>The association says it is in favour of broadband being expanded to rural communities, but wants masts and cables to be discreetly placed when it comes to parks and beauty spots, including the use of well-hidden lattice masts among trees. It also proposes that underground cables owned by BT should be used to save some of Britain's most picturesque sites.</p> <p>Hilary Benn, the shadow secretary of state for communities and local government, said the bill, which would relax planning constraints for a five-year period, would create a \"free-for-all\" in which cables and masts would disfigure some of the most scenic parts of the country. He said: \"This risks undermining a planning system that has effectively balanced protecting our national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty from intrusive and ugly development while also ensuring that high speed internet can be rolled out throughout the country, including to communities living in these areas.</p> <p>\"Eric Pickles is threatening a five-year communications free-for-all in our national parks which are much-loved by all of us who value England's green and pleasant land.\"</p> <p>Sarah Wright of Mast Sanity, a campaign group, added that she was also concerned about the health implications for wildlife in the parks and beauty spots.</p>",

  "<p>Syrian rebels have attacked government forces guarding a key airbase in the north of the country, activists said, a day before an opposition conference begins in Qatar.</p> <p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said opposition forces had launched a dawn raid and were battling for control of the Taftanaz base south of Aleppo, close to the road linking the city with the capital, Damascus.</p> <p>Videos posted online purportedly showed the attack, including a rebel vehicle firing rockets and smoke rising over buildings and what appears to be an airstrip.</p> <p>Fighters from Jabhat al-Nusra, an al-Qaida-inspired Islamic militant group made up of foreign jihadis, took part in the attack, according to the Observatory.</p> <p>Al-Nusra fighters have led attacks on other airbases in the north in past months. The Taftanaz base mainly houses military helicopters, and the attack was intended to disrupt strikes by warplanes and helicopters that have pounded rebel-held towns. The Syrian National Council (SNC), the main exile opposition group, is holding a congress in Doha starting on Sunday, before the launch on Thursday of a plan to bring together the external opposition and the revolutionary councils leading the insurrection inside Syria behind a common programme for a democratic transition.</p> <p>The Syrian national initiative will create a council of about 50 members chaired by Riad Seif, a Sunni businessman who left Syria in June after being imprisoned by the regime.</p> <p>The Doha initiative has been organised by the Qatari government and has drawn support from the US, Britain and France as a way of creating a single coherent Syrian opposition that could take part in peace talks with President Bashar al-Assad's regime or, if talks fail, provide a channel for greater military support to the rebels.</p> <p>Russia, however, opposes the plan, arguing that it reneges on an earlier international agreement to pursue the formation of a new government by \"mutual consent\" of the parties to the conflict. The SNC leadership has also criticised the plan, in which its influence will be diluted, and it is not yet clear which of the divided rebel forces inside Syria will turn up on Thursday or whether they will agree on the common platform once they arrive in Doha.</p> <p>Activists say more than 36,000 people have been killed in Syria since the uprising began in March 2011.

  "<p>With the election only days away, it is a fair question to ask how many American voters are about to cast their votes for a candidate who doesn't really reflect their views? Why would they do that?</p> <p>The answer is complex \u2013 and simple. The Republicans and Democrats have spent decades trading power back and forth between themselves, and in doing so, have managed to install a two-party duopoly that completely controls America's political process. This duopoly runs everything from how candidates qualify to get on the ballot, to who is invited to the only debates aired on national television, to, yes, the special-interest money that fuels their <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2012/10/2012-election-spending-will-reach-6.html\">billion-dollar campaigns</a>.</p> <p>The consequences of this insider game? Too many voters approach Tuesday's election believing their choice is between a Republican and a Democrat, with no other real option. And why shouldn't they? The debates they have seen only included the Republican and the Democrat. The hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of TV ads they have seen are all about the Republican and the Democrat. And the news media? Well, they have bought into the whole scheme, with coverage that overwhelmingly portrays a two-party race.</p> <p>There's a problem, though. This duopoly leaves tens of millions of Americans essentially disenfranchised. Polling shows that <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2012/08/23/a-closer-look-at-the-parties-in-2012/\">roughly one third of voters</a> doesn't necessarily consider themselves Democrats <em>or</em> Republicans. Every election, they end up making a choice between what some would call the \"lesser of two evils\".</p> <p>Where is it written that voters' choices should be so limited? Certainly not in the US constitution. Certainly not in the law. And certainly not because the voters themselves decided that the media, two massively well-funded political parties or anyone else should \"preselect\" their choices for them.</p> <p>In Tuesday's election, the sizable portion of the American electorate that believes the time is past when our troops should have been brought home from Afghanistan doesn't have a \"major-party\" candidate who agrees with them. The millions who believe government is far too large and intrusive will be looking at major-party options that <a href=\"http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/reawakening-liberty/2012/nov/2/support-kill-list-and-ndaa-make-obama-and-romney-u\">both support</a> the Patriot Act and a National Defense Authorization Act, which inexplicably legalizes the indefinite detention of American citizens. And for those who care deeply about marriage equality, they won't see a major-party candidate who believes marriage discrimination violates basic constitutional rights.</p> <p>On the most compelling issue of all in these difficult times, the economy, what do the two major parties offer? Vague assurances that they will balance the budget someday, years or even <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2012/09/24/news/economy/romney-balanced-budget/index.html\">decades from now</a>, quibbling over minor adjustments to a fundamentally flawed and corrupt tax system. And neither offers any real commitment to challenge monetary policies that are devaluing our currency by the day.</p> <p>Where is the choice on election day for a candidate who will balance the budget <em>now</em> and propose the first substantial reform of the entire tax code in decades \u2013 scrapping taxes on income and replacing them with a single consumption tax that will create millions of jobs?</p> <p>Giving the American people these choices is what my campaign for president is all about. Of our $16tn debt, almost equal amounts have been racked up under Republicans and Democrats. Our chronic involvement in costly and unnecessary wars has come through a progression of major-party administrations that seem to have little or no disagreements on foreign policy. Likewise, the truly alarming erosion of our civil liberties by the federal government has been an entirely bipartisan effort. </p> <p>Americans deserve the opportunity to vote for a third choice: a candidate who is neither a product <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/06/legalising-marijuana-gary-johnson\">nor a proponent of a status quo</a> that is clearly not working. My candidacy, the thousands of volunteer hours spent overcoming obstacles to ballot access, and the determination of our campaign to \"crash the party\" are all driven by the desire and, I believe, <em>the imperative</em> to break the two-party stranglehold.</p> <p>It will not happen in one election. But like all significant movements in American history, it can start with one election if the disenfranchised \"waste their votes\" in significant enough numbers to become franchised again.</p>",
  "<p>The earth no longer shakes when these two teams meet. In its time this fixture has seen battles on and off the pitch, food fights, goal feasts and title deciders, but it is fast becoming just an ordinary game. Manchester United did not have to be at their best to beat Arsenal, indeed they were a long way below their best, especially in the finishing department, yet the result was never in doubt.</p> <p>\"I can't believe the chances we missed,\" Sir Alex Ferguson said. \"Two-one sounds a close game and it wasn't a close game at all. I thought we were far too casual, but it was a strange game all round. It was nothing like the United-Arsenal games of old. Thank God we got a second goal, with them scoring right at the end, because 1-1 would have been an embarrassment. \"</p> <p>Arsenal finished with 10 men after Jack Wilshere collected a second caution, though that was due more to Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's failure to protect his combative midfielder than any grudges being played out on the pitch. Ferguson withdrew Tom Cleverley for his own good after his midfielder picked up a booking, whereas Wenger let Wilshere continue and even tried to defend his player's actions after he had been dismissed for a foul on Patrice Evra.</p> <p>\"His game is commitment,\" the Arsenal manager said, quite unusually for someone who frequently berates opponents for similar offences against his players. \"I thought he went for the ball.\"</p> <p>Everyone was aware that the game was bound to revolve around Robin van Persie in some way, though few could have anticipated his moment of impact coming so early. Wenger fretted beforehand that though his defenders know Van Persie well they might still not be sharp enough to match his reactions. He did not consider the possibility that his defence might be dozy enough to practically invite their former striker to open the scoring in under three minutes, but that is exactly what happened. Thomas Vermaelen was perfectly positioned to deal with Rafael da Silva's routine cross from the right, yet inexplicably instead of clearing or controlling the ball he made a present of it to Van Persie with a predictable result.</p> <p>For a team beaten 8-2 here last season that was not the most auspicious of starts, and Vito Mannone had to keep out Van Persie again midway through the first half from Wayne Rooney's measured pass after Arsenal had lost the ball on half way. Antonio Valencia was beating Andr\u00e9 Santos with ease on the right wing and from a succession of promising openings United were actually quite wasteful.</p> <p>While Mannone had to save from Rooney and Van Persie again before the interval the deadly duo did not make the most compelling case for United's return to a conventional 4-4-2. Rooney could not even convert a penalty right at the end of the first half, missing the target after Santi Cazorla blocked Ashley Young's cross with his hands.</p> <p>Arsenal were beginning to come back into the game a little at that point, with Cazorla and Wilshere finding space in midfield, without ever offering anything resembling pace or penetration. Theo Walcott, who occasionally supplies both, was left on the bench after scoring a hat-trick in the Capital One Cup at Reading in midweek. Fully aware their side would have turned round two goals down but for Rooney's penalty miss, the Arsenal supporters ended the half chanting Walcott's name and imploring Wenger to \"sort it out\".</p> <p>Arsenal's top scorer finally took the field seven minutes into the second half, by which time his side had been let of the hook once again by United. Vermaelen managed to repeat his trick of coughing up the ball to Van Persie, and from the striker's low cross Valencia should have been able to accept an open goal.</p> <p>When Van Persie wasted the next golden opportunity with an uncharacteristically weak shot that allowed Mannone to make a fingertip save it began to look as if United might regret their endless generosity, an impression that was immediately corrected when they scored from the resulting corner. Young played it short to Rooney, whose angled cross was met with a firm header by Evra.</p> <p>That looked like game over, even if Arsenal are the new comeback kings, and any remote hope of Madejski-type heroics was extinguished when Wilshere earned a second yellow three minutes later. The midfielder had done well to stay out of trouble after picking up an early caution for a scything tackle from behind on Cleverley, but when he caught Evra on the ankle with raised studs he knew the referee had little option but to produce another card.</p> <p>Only United complacency could allow Arsenal back in the game now, and when Michael Carrick passed straight to Cazorla hope briefly flickered, only for Walcott to blaze wastefully over the bar when presented with a decent shooting chance. That must have been disappointing for the travelling support at that end, but by this stage they were singing about Ivan Gazidis. They don't like him, and they wonder what the Arsenal chief executive does.</p> <p>Cazorla's lovely goal with the last kick of the game will have cheered them up slightly, but only slightly. Had United been properly at the races this would have been another drubbing.</p> <p>\"We were sloppy with our chances,\" Van Persie said. \"I should have scored two goals but I'm happy with one.\"</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>There's no getting away from this:</strong> Arsenal lost this fixture 8-2 last season. Eight goals to two! And one of their two was scored by Robin van Persie, who, well, y'know.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>But Arsenal fans should find succour in the fact that it's a once-in-a-lifetime freak resul...</strong> erm, except of course they've just won their last match 7-5, after being four goals down at Reading. And that came less than two years after giving up a four-goal lead in the Premier League themselves (at Newcastle in February 2011), while in the interim they've completed amazing comebacks at Chelsea (5-3) and against Spurs (5-2) and nearly pulled off another versus Milan in the European Cup (losing 4-3 on aggregate after being 4-0 down). Manchester United, meanwhile, have just won 3-2 at previously unbeaten league leaders Chelsea, before snatching defeat from the jaws of victory against the same opposition, going down 5-4 in the League Cup. Absolutely <em>anything</em> could happen here today, the way these two clubs are clowning around.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>So, there we go, I've just guaranteed a 0-0, then.</strong> Oop! Sorry. Still, everyone involved could probably do with calming down a wee bit after the week they've had.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Nevertheless, here's what everyone, except your MBM reporter, is hoping for today:</strong> Another ten or twelve goal thriller, please!</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>What your MBM reporter is hoping for today:</strong> A 90-minute lull, and the prospect of leaving the office with fully functioning fingers.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>What Arsenal will be hoping for today:</strong> A change in recent form, because United did the double over them last season, and have won six of the last seven encounters between the two teams, and 10 of the last 13. United have also, perhaps more relevantly, won 11 of their last 13 games. Additionally, the Gunners haven't won at Old Trafford since Emmanuel Adebayor snatched a late 1-0 victory in September 2006. They'll be looking for a big Fortune Switcheroo, and a day during which former charge van Persie keeps very quiet to boot (unless he somehow manages to get himself sent off, Liam O'Brien style, in the first minute).</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Kick off:</strong> 12.45pm.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>Manchester United name the same starting XI from last Sunday's win at Stamford Bridge:</strong> De Gea, Da Silva, Ferdinand, Evans, Evra, Valencia, Carrick, Cleverley, Young, Rooney, van Persie.<br>Subs: Lindegaard, Anderson, Hernandez, Nani, Scholes, Powell, Wootton.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>Arsenal are also unchanged from their previous league game, last Saturday's victory over QPR :</strong> Mannone, Sagna, Mertesacker, Vermaelen, Andre Santos, Arteta, Ramsey, Wilshere, Cazorla, Podolski, Giroud.<br>Subs: Martinez, Koscielny, Walcott, Coquelin, Arshavin, Jenkinson, Chamakh.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Mike Dean (Wirral), whose last runout came at White Hart Lane a fortnight ago, when Spurs were spanked 4-2 by Chelsea. Dean has doled out 28 yellows and one red in his nine games so far this season, Fernando Forestieri of Watford the only chap he's sent packing. He's refereed United and Arsenal once each this season, and on both occasions the teams have been good little boys: no bookings for United in their 3-2 win at Southampton, and no cards for Arsenal in their 1-1 draw at Manchester City. Of course, we hope we're not talking about the referee in such depth come full time, except we all sort of hope we are, because penalties, red cards, egregious decisions and 21-man brawls can be fun. Hey, we can't all be purists.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>The teams are out!</strong> Lovely scenes in the tunnel, with Robin van Persie embracing a few of his old Arsenal pals as the players line up. That'll be the pleasantries over with, then. Everyone takes to the pitch for the ludicrous pre-match handshakes, United in their trademark southern-belle gingham, Arsenal in one of Internazionale's old cast-offs. Big clubs with a lot of tradition, right here. \"Speaking as Arsenal fan: should this match be announced as Irresistible Force vs Immovable Object v2.0?\" wonders Admir Paji\u00e6. \"It's the best attack vs best defense in the league so far - Manchester United averaged three goals scored per game since opening defeat against Everton while Arsenal conceded only six in nine matches. On the other hand, given that United more or less had under-average defense so far and Arsenal attackers scored nine out of 14 goals in two matches (Southampton and West Ham United), this could be dubbed as Movable Object vs Resistible Force as well.\"</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>And we're off!</strong> Arsenal get proceedings under way, hoofing the ball long towards the Stretford End, and losing possession after 0.00000003 seconds. United respond by hoicking it upfield quickly themselves, to little effect. More please, teams!</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> Young skitters down the left at speed. He's got a bit of room after nipping behind Sagna, but the resulting low cross is a bit useless and flies straight into the hands of Mannone, with no United attacker anywhere near it. \"To bring an air of calm to footballing proceedings, rather than wearing t-shirts each player should be required to carry a cup of tea on a saucer while doing their tackling and passing,\" suggests Ian Copestake. \"It will inject a much needed gentility into the game. Excessive spillage will result in a straight red.\" Sounds like a plan to me. Putting the milk in before the tea can be a bookable offence. And instead of throwing bits of pizza in the tunnel, they can launch cucumber sandwiches into each other's affronted coupons.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>3 min: ROBIN VAN PERSIE SCORES!!! Manchester United 1-0 Arsenal.</strong> What a start by United! And what a double cock-up by Arsenal. Rafael is sent clear down the right, Andre Santos lounging around in no-man's-land like an eejit. Rafael sweeps a low cross into the area. Vermaelen looks to hack clear, but doesn't connect particularly well. Not at all. The ball flies straight to van Persie, on the edge of the area, level with the right-hand post. And the former Arsenal striker threads a magnificent first-time effort into the bottom-left corner. An exquisite finish, and one that van Persie chooses not to celebrate. There's nice, I suppose, though players really need to stop this nonsense. He's a United player now, and should scamper about accordingly.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Arsenal are attempting to calm themselves down by stringing a few passes around at the back, but they're going nowhere fast, and look stunned and highly nervous. \"Just looked up the word Santos in the dictionary, <em>'noun, a slow object that is prone to persistent errors, no understanding of stopping other objects moving past it'</em>,\" writes our answer to Susie Dent, Ciaran McGowan. \"Santos presence in the team always guarantees excitement and goals - for the opposition. What is Wenger thinking; leaving a wooden box in the left back opposition would be more effective than Santos.\"</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> Arsenal have settled a wee bit now, after that early shock. Ramsey looks to get something going down the right, but after cutting inside his low pass in the direction of Giroud is cut out by Cleverley. \"Like many ageing MBMer, the prospect of new Star Wars films (hurrah!) and Robbie Williams being number 1 has me wallowing in nostalgia,\" writes Ryan Dunne. \"As such, surely, despite last season's 8-2, it would be great to see a return to the early-mid 00s calibre of this fixture. All it would take is Arsenal to stop selling all their best players and Man U to actually have a midfield and we could be in for a new, Viera v Keane, pizzagate-style golden age!\"</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> Wilshere sets a lovely Arsenal move going down the right. The resulting cross by Ramsey is cleared easily enough, but the ball finds its way to the feet of Andre Santos, who from 20 yards screws a risible effort miles right of goal. To be fair, the ball doesn't quite go out for a throw, but there's only a foot or two in it. Still, this is a reasonable response by Arsenal, though United seem happy enough to sit back at the moment.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> Andre Santos gives the ball away in midfield, when attempting to find Arteta, who's about ten yards away from him in acres of space. The Arsenal left back is having the dictionary definition of a shocker so far. Still, there's plenty of time for him to turn it round, which can either be a good thing or a very worrying state of affairs indeed, depending which way you look at it.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> Wilshere is booked for a totally pointless swipe from behind on Cleverley. That's a no-brainer for the referee. The Arsenal youngster had just been clattered himself, fairly enough in a 50-50 front-on challenge with (I think, but I'm not sure) van Persie, but you could see the red mist descend. He'll need to calm down quicksmart.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> United are enjoying the lion's share of possession, but in the calm style; they're in no rush to bomb forward. Arsenal, meanwhile, are still trying to press forward in response to their predicament, but the passes aren't quite sticking. \"Why is Santos getting pelters for Vermaelen's horrendous howler?\" wonders Sasu Laaksonen. \"Some perspective please. Vermaelen is not even English. There's no need to mollycoddle him.\"</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> Rooney releases van Persie into the Arsenal box down the inside left. The striker has to check back, Mertesacker tracking him well. The ball's fed to Young, who slides an appalling low ball straight to Vermaelen, who clears properly this time.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> Acres of space down the right again for United, courtesy of our pal Andre Santos, who's popped off on holiday to Blackpool, I think. Valencia scampers along the touchline, though his eventual cross isn't much cop. \"Regarding Dictionary's Santos: isn't it the case that Wenger's teams over the past years have contained two or three players who are clearly not good enough to play at the very top level?\" suggests Patrick O'Brien. \"When was the last time Arsenal's first team contained 11 great players? Do we have to go back to Vieira / Petit / Bergkamp etc?\" Wait until half-time, I'll have the answer for you then.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Rooney sends van Persie scampering into the Arsenal area again, this time down the right. Van Persie hammers a shot goalwards from a tight-ish angle, but it's straight at Mannone, who parries well. United have suddenly turned up the heat a wee bit, and Arsenal are warping a bit down this wing.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>22 min:</strong> A corner for United down the left off Sagna, but it's wasted, so.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> It's end to end all of a sudden, with Ramsey scooting down the right, and Evra mooching around in the Santosian style. Ramsey nips past the snoozing left-back, and hammers a low cross towards the near post for Giroud, but the increasingly impressive De Gea gets down well to palm clear with purpose. Still, that's better from Arsenal, who were rocking there for a couple of minutes.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> A neat turn by Podolski, 30 yards from goal, followed by a sliderule pass down the inside left. Giroud can't quite get onto the end of it, but that was neat play from the visitors.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> That Podolski turn has been sandwiched by two sorties by Valencia down the right, unguarded by the farcical Andre Santos. The first cross is headed clear with ease. The second lands at Rooney's feet, the berugged striker forcing a fine parry from Mannone as a shot rasps in from the left. The ball breaks to van Persie, who guides the ball goalwards, but with little pace, allowing the keeper to mop up.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> Young is booked for a lousy late stamp on Sagna's tootsies. He can have no complaints.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>31 min:</strong> Santos is in space down the left, but with teammates in the area and United a tad stretched, he loops an aimless cross into the hands of De Gea. So far, the Brazilian's performance has been one of the real stinkeroos. There's surely a chance he won't be out for the second half, although whether that's because he gets the hook, or has accidentally locked himself in a cupboard under the stairs while looking for a lost pair of trousers, may be a moot point.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Van Persie wins a header near the halfway line and sends Cleverley scampering clear down - yes - the right wing. Cleverley's got Rooney and Young in the middle, but Santoses the cross straight at Vermaelen, who heads clear. How United haven't scored at least a second is beyond me. Arsenal have been very poor.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> Carrick should be booked for a rake down the back of Wilshere's ankle, the challenge whipping off the Arsenal man's boot. But the referee doesn't produce a card.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>36 min:</strong> Wilshere's in the wars. He attempts to get something going down the left, but loses control and ends up in a heap by the advertising hoardings. His pained frown as he gathers himself up speaks volumes.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> Cleverley is made to look not-so-clever by Cazorla, who drops a shoulder and sashays past him. The United man sticks a boot out, brings the Spanish star down, and is booked for his trouble.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> Cazorla busies himself down the left, a move which ends in a corner. The Spaniard whips it into the six-yard area himself; Giroud's header is appalling. Not that a goal would have counted, for there's been a spot of hanky-panky in the area, United getting the decision.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> Arsenal are showing signs of recovery, pelting forwards, perhaps having decided that attack is not so much the best form of defence, but in fact their only option in that regard. Cazorla gyrates down the middle, and isn't far away from releasing Podolski with a fizzing pass down the inside-left channel. It doesn't reach his man, but again, this is a wee bit better from the visitors.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> Guess who's been caught miles out of position upfield, allowing United to attack down which wing? Yes, and yep. Rooney it is this time in acres, with Rafael offering the overlap. Arteta, coming over to fill the gap, tackles brilliantly, springs gently to his feet, and makes off with the ball, saving the day for his side. That was a textbook I-think-I'll-have-that-thank-you-very-much interception.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Rooney bustles down the right, and curls a low cross into the middle towards Cleverley. Mertesacker slashes the ball behind for the corner, nearly finding his own top-left corner of the net. And then, from the set piece...</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>45 min: PENALTY TO UNITED!</strong> Young looks to cross into the area from the left-hand side of the box. Cazorla puts his hands up to shield himself, and can have no complaints when the ball hits his mitts and the referee points to the spot.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>45 min +1: ROONEY MISSES THE PENALTY!</strong> It's a preposterous effort, dragged wide left of the goal. Dear me.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>HALF TIME: Manchester United 1-0 Arsenal.</strong> And that's that for the half. Arsenal have been dismal, and are extremely fortunate not to be at least two goals down. Their fans are chanting for Theo Walcott. Surely Arsene Wenger - who shares a cheery word with van Persie as everyone leaves the field - will change things at half time. I wonder who he'll take off? A clue, perhaps, in Andre Santos asking van Persie for his shirt. And getting it! Oh for goodness sake, this is going too far now.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>HALF-TIME SINGALONG-A-ARSENAL FROM BETTER TIMES:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gx_uKCsNwlc#t=1m10s\">All good pals and jolly good company.</a> Probably worth winding it back to the start, too. Can't work out whether Jack Lambert is a picture of glorious seething malevolence, or just a bit camerashy. Either way, 109 goals in 161 games, how Arsenal could do with him now. Robin van who?</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>And we're off again!</strong> No changes. Andre Santos is still on the park, in other words. United get the ball rolling, and will be heading towards the Stretford End this time round. \"As a Man U fan I would submit either the 97/98 squad (Wenger's second season) or the infamous 2001/02 team,\" writes Martin Baloch, in a response to Patrick O'Brien's 19th-minute question which is more considered than just bunging up some old clip from the 1930s. \"The first was rather tasty looking for intimidation purposes - Seaman, Bould, Dixon, Winterburn, Adams, Viera, Petit, Overmars, Parlour, Bergkamp, Wright/Anelka - while the 01/02 squad was a best of with some new tracks, Henry at his most deadly: Seaman, Lauren, Campbell, Keown, Cole, Ljungberg, Parlour, Viera, Pires, Wiltord, Henry.\" Two wonderful teams. You can be damn sure Thomas Vermaelen wouldn't have got into either of them. Or, for that matter... but let's not riff on poor old Andre Santos's pain any further.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> Vermaelen faffs round with the ball at his feet, 30 yards from goal, and allows van Persie to scoot clear down the right. The striker crosses low for Valencia, who is clear six yards out, but somehow manages to waft an over-elaborate flick wide left of goal. United should be out of sight. Arsenal fans may be wishing both Vermaelen and Santos were out of <em>their</em> sight.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Young robs Mertesacker down the left, and slips the ball into the centre. Rafael cuts in from the right but sees his shot deflected back out. Carrick attempts to sidefoot into the top-left corner, but overcooks a woeful effort. Arsenal are really rocking here.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Andre Santos scampers into space of his own down the left. He looks up, spots there's nobody in the six-yard box, and so sends a cross through the six-yard box. On the other wing, Cazorla starts doing quite a lot of loud shouting, stopping just short of hopping around in the impotent style.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> Arsene Wenger, having seen enough, makes his first change. Ramsey is swapped for Walcott, the away fans getting their wish. \"At least when we sell Santos the Arsenal board will genuinely be able to say it was footballing reasons,\" sighs frustrated Gooner Gavin O'Reilly. \"Trust Arsenal to really show RVP what a mistake he made leaving!\"</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> Arsenal stream forward, Cazorla coming in from the left and sliding a low ball towards the near post for Giroud, who takes a touch before skelping an effort into the side netting. Not exactly brilliant, but the first time Arsenal have got anywhere near the United goal. They'll look to build on this, small acorns and all that.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> Cazorla sliderules Andre Santos free with a wonderful pass down the left. The hapless full back clanks a risible cross into the stand, with the box loaded. It's difficult to escape the feeling that Andre Santos has won some sort of competition to be here. Still, he's had a nice day out.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> Evra drops a shoulder down the left, then pulls the ball back for Rooney, who from the edge of the area looks to sidefoot into the top right. Vermaelen chests down, then in the resulting melee van Persie handles. Arsenal really are all over the shop at the back.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> Cleverley - already booked, remember - comes sliding in from the right and upends Wilshere in a rather clumpish manner. That should have been a second yellow, but not for the first time, the referee takes pity on a player already with a booking to his name.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> Van Persie comes sliding in on Sagna, and is booked for the forward's challenge.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> Cleverley, who could easily have been walking, is replaced by the wise old owl Fergie. Anderson comes on in the player's stead.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> Anderson, turning down the inside-right channel, curls a lovely crossfield pass towards Young, who is <em>this</em> close to trapping the ball and scooting clear into the area. But no. \"Personally I'm hoping that in 2014 Brazil field both Santos and David Luiz in defence,\" writes Jeff Stranks. \"It would mean that the likes of Oscar and Neymar would really have to show us what they're capable of in order to make up that two-to-three-goal deficit they'd be starting off with. And wouldn't that be a show.\" Preach on, brother, I'd tune in. It'd only be better if you could guarantee a victory for either Argentina or, preferably given the way 1950 panned out, Uruguay. Football being all about schadenfreude, and that.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Free kick for Arsenal down the right. Podolski curls it in, the ball going all the way through the box and out just to the left of goal. Arsenal are slowly getting back into this game.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Young cuts in from the left and curls a majestic ball into the Arsenal area, van Persie beating the offside trap and sidefooting towards the bottom left. Mannone fingertips brilliantly, turning the ball around the post. Corner for United! From which...</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>67 min: GOAL!!! Manchester United 2-0 Arsenal.</strong> The ball's worked out to Rooney, who from the left curls a peach of a cross onto the head of Evra, who guides an effort into the left-hand side of goal. This two-goal lead is no more than the home side deserve.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Arsenal are on the ropes again. United stream forward for the nth time, with Anderson sidefooting over from the edge of the area.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>69 min: RED CARD FOR WILSHERE!!!</strong> A second yellow - and it could have been a straight red - for the young Arsenal midfielder, as he steps on Evra's ankle, sending it bending in a rather disconcerting way. Evra will be fine, but the Future Of English Football\u2122 is off for an early soak.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> Anderson, channeling his inner overweight lummox, stands in the way of Arteta. He's booked.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Andre Santos has been quiet for a while. Anyway, here he is, somehow avoiding a booking for cynically putting a stop to van Persie's gallop. \"I've already imagined the scenario of Argentina beating Brazil in the final,\" writes Jeff Stranks (63 min). \"As someone who lives in Brazil, I'd frankly love it (best not say why) but would be careful to stay indoors for a week or so, and then come out with a placard round my neck saying 'Meu sotaque n\u00e3o \u00e9 argentino, ta bom meus irm\u00e3os!' (My accent isn't Argentinean, OK guys?!)\"</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> A dismal ball rolled through midfield by Carrick to nobody is picked up by Cazorla, who makes for the Arsenal area at speed. He nudges the ball out right to Walcott, who immediately smashes an inept shot into the stand behind. \"I remember fondly the days when Arsenal posed a threat to the evil empire,\" writes Matthew Coyle. \"Used to be all fields round here.\"</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> Rooney lifts a ball down the middle to release van Persie, the striker hammering an effort into the bottom-left corner. Luckily for Arsenal, who could have been on the end of a real thumping here, the United forward is clearly offside.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> The United fans have started singing their annual festive number about Eric Cantona. Four Cantonas, three Cantonas, and all that. It's only just turned November! Come on, folks. Poor show. This is no better than Tesco.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> United put the ball in the net again, triangulating awhile before van Persie springs forward down the inside left and slides the ball across for Anderson, who sidefoots into the bottom right. But Anderson was a smidgen offside, and the goal's rightly chalked off.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> Rooney is booked for a cynical clip on Arteta, as the Arsenal midfielder looks to break forward into the United half.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Each side makes a change. Arshavin comes on for Podolski, while Nani replaces Valencia.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> Arshavin has been on the field for less than a minute, and he's already in the book - but then again, who isn't - for a late lunge on Rafael as the Brazilian bustles at high speed down the right.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> Rooney releases Nani down the right. The winger lifts a cross into the centre, and only staunch work by Mertesacker stops van Persie heading home by the far post. It's a corner to United, from which nowt happens.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> United haven't been shy in looking for their third goal - they are certainly worth it - but for the minute they're happy enough to knock it around a leisurely pace. Eventually they shuttle forward, Van Persie chasing after an exploratory ball down the inside right, but there's far too much weight on the pass and Mannone comes out to clear.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Vermaelen does well to bustle Nani off the ball as United look to break into the area down the right, but to be honest the defender's horse has long bolted. About 84 minutes ago, in fact. \"I think Koscielny is a far sounder defender, current dip not withstanding,\" opines Rob Lowery, who has seen \"a lot of Vermalens in my time. They look the part, make heroic interceptions but directly, and more often indirectly, leave a mess for others to deal with.\"</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> United take a corner from the right. It comes to nothing. Arsenal look to break through Cazorla. It comes to nothing. This is over, although that's been the case since the third minute.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> Arteta is booked for pushing his arm into van Persie's coupon. \"It will interesting to see if the English media - with so much invested in hyping Wilshere as The Future of English Football - has the intellectual integrity to rip him for his stupidity in being sent off in a big match,\" writes Roger Brown. Intell-what? Integrit-eh? Oh Roger!</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>90 min +2:</strong> De Gea saves at Giroud's feet, the striker latching onto a low left-wing cross from Cazorla. A 2-1 scoreline would have seriously flattered Arsenal, who have been appalling today, barring a wee burst of energy after half time.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>90 min +4: GOAL!!! Manchester United 2-1 Arsenal.</strong> Some head tennis in the United area. The ball lands at the feet of Cazorla, level with the left-hand post on the edge of the box. He drops a shoulder, takes a nudge inside, then pelts a wonderful effort into the top left. Not that it matters, because...</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>FULL TIME: Manchester United 2-1 Arsenal.</strong> Cazorla's goal is the last kick of the game. And that 2-1 scoreline really does flatter Arsenal, who were dismal today. Still, Santi Cazorla, eh? And as for Robin van Persie... well. He's helped to send a very impressive United to the top of the table for the first time of the season; they'll stay there unless Chelsea win at Swansea City later on.</p>",

  "<p>Sandy Allan and his climbing partner Rick Allen were at their last camp below the summit of Nanga Parbat, the world's ninth highest mountain, when they gathered together the food they had left.</p> <p>After 14 days on the vast unclimbed Mazeno Ridge \u2013 the longest in the Himalayas \u2013 it amounted to a packet of McVitie's Digestives biscuits.</p> <p>A lighter they had taken with them had stopped working, its flint worn through. The only spare, they realised, was in the pocket of another member of the team who, exhausted and demoralised, had already decided to descend.</p> <p>The consequence was that they could not light their stove to boil snow for water, essential on the world's highest mountains where the consequence of dehydration is the risk of frostbite and pulmonary and cerebral oedema. They hoped, however, that they could reach the summit and descend the imposing Diamir Face in a day and a half; they were counting on fixed ropes left by other expeditions. In reality, it took them three full days to get down from the summit without any food or water, a lengthy struggle through deep snow at the limits of survival.</p> <p>Photographs of the two men at base camp indicate what they endured in conquering the last unclimbed ridge on the world's 14 peaks of 8,000 metres \u2013 a 13km long undertaking that had rebuffed all previous attempts. Rick Allen, seated drinking tea, appears skeletal. Wiry before he started, his body was starved by the effort.</p> <p>In the midst of the Olympics, the achievement of the two men in climbing the ridge dubbed the \"last great problem of the Himalayas\" passed almost unnoticed. In the months that followed, it has become recognised as the most impressive British ascent on an 8,000m peak in a generation, the first major new route since the first ascent of the Kangshung Face of Everest by an Anglo-US team, including Stephen Venables, in 1988.</p> <p>Now that their story can be told in full for the first time, it is even more remarkable, not least because of their ages: Allan was 57 and Rick Allen 59 when they made their climb.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398809887\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/4/1351989684652/Nanga-Parbat-graphic-001.jpg\" alt=\"Nanga Parbat graphic\" width=\"460\" height=\"275\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The ascent of Nanga Parbat along the Mazeno Ridge.

Then the US team of Doug Chabot and Steve Swenson climbed all the subsidiary peaks to reach the shoulder below the final 2km of slopes to the summit. But with bad weather and Swenson ill, they had retreated.</p> <p>\"It had always inspired me,\" said Allan last week. \"I had talked about going back again with Voytek Kurtyka [the Polish climber], but for personal reasons it did not happen. I'd been on it before, climbing three of the subsidiary summits before we hit a brick wall. I knew what was needed to climb it.\"</p> <p>The team he put together with Allen included three Sherpas and Cathy O'Dowd. The other four team members would become exhausted and \"discouraged\" by the scale of the ridge, electing to descend before the final ascent.</p> <p>\"When we got to the whale back ridge at the beginning people were saying, 'Wow, this ridge is enormous. Jeepers \u2013 it's a long way'. You would cross one of the summits and there was just more and more of it going on.\"</p> <p>Even with the most optimistic assumptions \u2013 planning for eight days' food and fuel they thought they could stretch to 10 \u2013 the climb would take 18 days with seven different camp and bivouac sites, some of them no more than snow holes. \"We didn't think it would take 18 days. I'd done the Diamir Face [the route they would descend down] two years ago. I thought \u2026 we could get over the summit and down in a day and a half. Instead we spent three nights on the descent.\"</p> <p>During that descent, without food or water, and with both men suffering from frostbitten feet, and slowed by deep snow, they were in danger .</p> <p>\"Cathy had left us the satellite phone when she descended. We had enough power for three calls. I was getting concerned the day after the summit. Rick was very tired. I called our agent to check what availability there might be for a helicopter if we got in trouble. I was worried and said we had the potential to be in trouble. Rick heard the call and rallied. He's a tough and determined individual. But he was very tired, sitting down to rest every few minutes, falling asleep sometimes. On the last day, which involved steep icy ground, what should have taken between three and four hours took us all day, getting into camp at 11 o'clock at night.\"</p> <p>Among those who praised the ascent was Doug Scott who described it as an \"incredible achievement\".</p> <p>The challenges of the ridge have been detailed by mountain guide Mark Synnott. \"Although the ridge itself is objectively safe,\" he wrote in a US climbing magazine, \"it's important to remember that the route's inordinate length makes it a very committing proposition. Both sides are guarded by huge Himalayan faces that you wouldn't want to abseil in your worst nightmare, so if you were less than halfway out, your best bet would be to backtrack \u2013 time-consuming and difficult in bad weather. Naturally, there's a point of no return.\"</p> <p>The question is why was there such a long gap between the mapping of British routes in the Himalayas. While some new routes have been opened up by the likes of Alan Hinkes, the first Briton to climb all the 8,000ers, the gap has been noticeable.</p> <p>Allan ascribes this historic change in emphasis to a series of high-profile disasters for British mountaineering, beginning with the disappearance of Peter Boardman and Joe Tasker on Everest in 1982. \"I think with the loss of Boardman and Tasker and Al Rouse on K2, there was a realisation that pushing big routes on big mountains could be very dangerous.\"</p> <p>Asked about the future he answers: \"I'm 57. I'm a father. The rat's been fed.\"</p> <p><em>Rick Allen will be giving a lecture on the ascent at the </em><a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Rheged%20Centre,%20Penrith\" title=\"http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Rheged%20Centre,%20Penrith\"><em>Rheged Centre, Penrith</em></a><em>, on 2 December (enquires@rheged.com) </em></p>",
  "<p>This week, David Cameron had the opportunity to take action to advance the cause once espoused by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wilberforce\" title=\"\">William Wilberforce</a> and support a move against modern-day slavery. He didn't take it.</p> <p>I have always thought there are issues and principles that stand above the usual party political point-scoring. And until recently, I thought that slavery and human trafficking were two of those. Last year, the prime minister made this bold statement: \"<a href=\"http://www.humantraffickingfoundation.org/02/parliamentary-questions-full-list-chronological/\" title=\"\">The UK will lead the world in eradicating modern-day slavery and human trafficking</a>\" and to support that sentiment, the government has slowly moved closer to fully implementing the <a href=\"http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/trafficking/docs/convntn/cets197_en.asp\" title=\"\">Council of Europe's convention on human trafficking</a>. So when I succeeded in the ballot for a private members bill, it was therefore logical, as vice chair of the parliamentary group on human trafficking, to <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/transparencyinukcompanysupplychainseradicationofslavery.html\" title=\"\">propose a bill</a> that would tackle modern-day slavery.</p> <p>The relevance of such a bill \u2013 one that would require UK companies to audit their supply chains \u2013 has become all the more obvious following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/31/gangmasters-exploit-flexible-workforce\" title=\"\">Felicity Lawrence's exposure in the Guardian</a> of what was described as the worst case of modern-day slavery ever seen in the UK. In this particular case, the gangmasters have been arrested, but not due to any vigilance on the part of the high street companies that sold products contaminated by slavery to innocent customers.</p> <p>Indeed, most organisations trying to eradicate human trafficking recognise that large numbers are held in enslaved conditions for the exploitation of their labour. My bill would create a framework for large UK companies to audit their supply chain in order to drive out modern-day slavery from their goods and services (this model has recently successfully become law in California).</p> <p>Support for the bill, which I tabled with cross-party support, has been widespread and church leaders, ethical business groups, civic society and specialist anti-slavery groups campaigned together in the runup to its second reading in the Commons on 19 October. I know it is tough to get a bill through that is lower down the ballot, but even Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative MP who toadied up to the government whips by agreeing to talk the bill out, spoke strongly in favour of its ideas and principles.</p> <p>During PMQs two weeks ago, David Cameron said he would \"look very carefully\" at my bill and write to me. I know he has had other troubles since then, but I asked the chief whip, Sir George Young, to consult with the prime minister and seize the opportunity to take a stand on the moral high ground, and take a step to eradicate modern-day slavery from the UK.</p> <p>On 2 November, the government had a second opportunity to allow my bill to pass to the next stage of the parliamentary process, but once again, whips organised filibuster and objection. But this bill and this issue will not go away. It will come before the gouse again on 18 January.</p> <p>Cameron needs to keep his pledge \u2013 that the UK is to lead the global fight against human trafficking and modern-day slavery. Dropping his opposition to the bill would help ensure that. I have still not received the letter he promised me, but a lot of non-governmental organisations <a href=\"http://www.walkfree.org/en/actions/UKtransparencybill\" title=\"\">are writing</a> to urge him to pay close attention \u2013 this includes ManpowerGroup, The Centre for Social Justice (founded by Iain Duncan Smith) and the Church of Scotland and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/unseenuk\" title=\"\">Unseen</a>.</p> <p>We won't give up until we achieve what we thought Wilberforce had already done all those years ago.</p>",
  "<p>When I went to vote last week in New York City, using an absentee ballot (because I will be out of the country on election day), I had a surreal experience that was also very ordinary: I marked my ballot \u2013 put it, as advised by the nice man behind the counter, into a sealed envelope, handed it to him and \u2026 nothing.</p> <p>That is, he looked at me quizzically as I waited. For what? I realized that in every transaction I ever had with the government, I get some kind of receipt or documentation. But I had just handed over my most precious possession, my vote, and I had nothing to show for it. No scrap of paper noting for the record what I had done, and no way to verify that what I wished to do got recorded accurately.</p> <p>The fellow offered, when I expressed some wish for something like this, to use my phone camera to take a picture of me holding the sealed envelope \u2013 for proof I had voted. Seriously.</p> <p>We treat the black hole where our votes vanish as if we don't dare to validate them partly because the process is so highly mystified. One aspect of this mystification, which gatekeepers use effectively against us, is the glamour around the secret ballot. That noble \"secrecy\" is what keeps citizen groups from observing the vote count, demanding verification slips, and so on.</p> <p>The secret vote was, in its time, a great idea. Before the secret ballot was popularized, it was standard practice to intimidate and threaten voters. But few know that America hasn't always had secret ballots. Indeed, the secret ballot didn't even originate in the US \u2013 the system we use is known, actually, as the \"Australian ballot\".</p> <p>The majority of US states did not move to that system \u2013 in which publicly-provided, printed ballots with the names of the candidates are marked in secret \u2013 until after 1884. Until 1891, indeed, Kentucky still held an \"oral ballot\"; and it wasn't till the election of President Grover Cleveland in 1892 that the first US president was elected entirely via secret ballot. </p> <p>Why do I point this out? Because our mystification of the secret ballot is one of the strange ways in which we treat our nation's voting system with truly weird magical thinking \u2013 much like the magical thinking (about which I have written here) that often attends global warming: a defiant, seven-year-old's refusal to connect point A and point B. By now, reams of solid reporting have documented the aberrations, high jinks, missing hard drives, voting machines that weirdly revert to one candidate, voting machines owned by friends of the candidate of one party, and other aspects of systematic corruption that attend America's voting.</p> <p>The dogged and deeply patriotic Mark Crispin Miller has meticulously documented masses more of these examples \u2013 notably in the last election in Ohio \u2013 in his <a href=\"http://harpers.org/archive/2005/08/none-dare-call-it-stolen/6/\">masterful Harper's essay last month, \"None Dare Call It Stolen.\"</a></p> <p>But this is what is weird about the way we are asked to think about the vote: as if nothing could ever ever ever go wrong with it, and as if it is crazy to entertain the notion that it might. To even raise the issue, with solid documentation, as many reporters and citizens have found out, is to risk immediate mockery \u2013 as Miller notes, citing 2004 headlines: \"Election Paranoia Surfaces: Conspiracy Theorists Call Results Rigged,\" chuckled the&#xa0;Baltimore Sun&#xa0;on 5 November; \"Internet Buzz on Vote Fraud is Dismissed,\" proclaimed the&#xa0;Boston Globe&#xa0;on 10 November; \"Latest Conspiracy Theory \u2013 Kerry Won \u2013 Hits the Ether,\" the&#xa0;Washington Post&#xa0;chortled on 11 November. </p> <p>Meanwhile, solid reporting on the war on voting, and on the corruption of the voting infrastructure, continues to mount, as in the <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-gop-war-on-voting-20110830\">Rolling Stone piece this summer on the GOP's \"war on voting\"</a>. and the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/23/pro-romney-firm-voting-machines_n_2006697.html\">Huffington Post notes the eyebrows raised</a> when a pro-Romney company buys a stake in the company that makes the machines that count our votes.</p> <p>Well, as a student of closing societies, I can tell you that it is crazy to ask Americans to have pure faith that the system is incorruptible, and to ask them to just drop their votes into a black hole and trust in the Lord \u2013 or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diebold#Premier_Election_Solutions_.2F_Diebold_Election_Systems\">Diebold</a>. If you look at weak democracies, the oligarchies that have taken undue control of them always seek to tamper with the vote. It is important for oligarchs to have elections to give their guy a veneer of legitimacy \u2013 and important for the vote always to turn out \"their way\". Indeed, something that is never reported in major news media here is that former President Carter's voting accountability organization sees America's system as relatively flawed and corrupted compared with the systems of many other nations. That is a situation that would typically bring observers from aid organizations like his to our polling places to help us count our vote. (See what happened to foreign poll observers in Miller's Harpers story who tried to watch the vote in America.)</p> <p>Here is my modest proposal: let us end the secret ballot, because we have reached a point, with the internet, in which transparency and accountability is more important than absolute secrecy. Don't panic, because this is what I mean: your vote won't be publicly available, but why can't I get a number when I hand in my ballot, or when I vote in a machine \u2013 just as I do with bloodwork, or computer passwords, or other transactions in which I get accountability, but not disclosure of my actual name? Then, the votes get tallied and posted \u2013 with their corresponding numbers \u2013 online on a public site, and major media reproduce the lists. And I can check my number (unidentifiable to anyone else) to check whether my vote was correctly registered.</p> <p>This would allow, in one sweep, all citizens to watch the watchers. It does not compel anyone to reveal his or her vote \u2013 but gives him or her the option of challenging a discrepancy, and the means to verify what he or she had actually intended to do. And in one easy, inexpensive, technically feasible gesture, it takes the power away from the Diebold-type private corporations and the various parties and the officials, and allows actual verification that cannot be spun or falsified. Most importantly, it removes a psychological blinder, which the American people are asked to wear every two and four years \u2013 the blinder that infantilizes us, that has highly interested individuals and groups say to us, \"we are impartial, this is a magically noble and incorruptible process: trust us.\"</p> <p>As President Ronald Reagan put it in another context: sure \u2013 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_verify\">trust, but verify</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The US government is scrambling to ease fuel shortages paralysing the north-east in the wake of superstorm Sandy, saying the military will buy motor fuel and truck it there and allow foreign tankers from the Gulf of Mexico to deliver petroleum products.<br> The Homeland Security Department has waived the Jones Act, a law that normally prohibits foreign-flagged vessels from shipping gasoline, diesel and other petroleum products from the Gulf of Mexico to north-eastern ports. The waiver, effective immediately, requires shipments to leave the Gulf region by 13 November and arrive in the north-east within a week. With power still out at many ports and gasoline stations hit by Sandy, and as petroleum supplies were robust before the storm, it was unclear how much fuel was needed immediately and how quickly it could get to customers. </p> <p>The US death toll hit 102 on Friday; Sandy had earlier killed 69 people as a hurricane the Caribbean, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/02/aftermath-hurricane-sandy-haiti-disaster\">leaving poorer countries like Haiti struggling to cope</a>. It struck the New Jersey coast on Monday as a rare hybrid superstorm after the hurricane merged with a powerful storm system in the north Atlantic. While power returned to much of Manhattan on Friday, residents of some of the hardest-hit areas still faced a long wait for electricity</p> <p>There were long lines outside gas stations around New York and New Jersey on Friday as supplies ran low. In the New York City borough of Queens, a man was accused of pulling a gun during a confrontation with a motorist who accused him of cutting in line.</p> <p>At noon on Friday the line for gas at the Shell station in the Brooklyn Heights area of Brooklyn weaved around three blocks and stretched back for almost half a mile. \"I've been here two and a half hours,\" said Brian Temporosa. \"I've been empty for probably two days now. Luckily I haven't run out yet but if I'm here for another 15 minutes then yeah, I might run out of gas.\"</p> <p>Krystyne Todaro, 45, had travelled a quarter of a mile to the Shell station in two and a half hours. \"This is the worst of what I've had to deal with so far, so I'm OK. It is what it is,\" she said.</p> <p>Mayor Michael Bloomberg responded to widespread criticism by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/02/new-york-cancels-marathon-sandy\">reversing a decision to go ahead with the New York Marathon</a>. Bloomberg insisted the race could have gone ahead safely but said the controversy was distracting from the rescue effort.</p> <p>The energy department announced that it was tapping the Northeast Heating Reserve for the first time, releasing about 48,000 barrels of ultra-low sulphur diesel for the Department of Defense to distribute to local and federal emergency services in New York and New Jersey.<br> The fuel will be used to supply emergency equipment, generators, buildings, trucks and other vehicles. </p> <p>The Department of Defense will begin drawing down as soon as Saturday from the reserve, created 12 years ago, which holds about a million barrels of diesel. It expects to give back the fuel within 30 days. </p> <p>In another move to ease the shortages the Obama administration directed the Defense Logistics Agency to purchase up to 380,000 barrels of unleaded gasoline and 317,000 barrels of diesel for distribution to storm-stricken areas. This purchase would be delivered by tanker trucks, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said in a statement. </p> <p>Earlier in the week the administration waived clean gasoline rules throughout most of the eastern seaboard as it struggled to take action after the deadly storm. </p> <p>The Homeland Security Department said it had received only one request from a company, which it did not identify, to waive the Jones Act. The law was created to support domestic jobs in the shipping industry and requires goods moved between US ports to be carried by ships built domestically and staffed by US crews. </p> <p>The American Maritime Partnership (AMP), a domestic maritime industry group, said it was not aware of any cases where US vessels had not been available to transport fuel but it supported waivers in the aftermath of the massive storm. \"We will not oppose waivers that are necessary to facilitate delivery of petroleum products into the regions affected by hurricane Sandy,\" AMP said in a letter to Obama and heads of several government departments. </p> <p>Shipping sources said the slow return of power to ports in New York Harbor had them considering delivering fuel to nearby cities such as Boston. </p> <p>Energy experts said the waiver might not bring immediate relief to fuel-strapped New York and New Jersey, where two refineries were shut by Sandy. But in the longer term shipping alternatives could help ensure steady supply throughout the north-east.</p>",

Two brilliant reflex saves in the first half kept the Sounders out, and then he charged down an Evans shot at point blank range to keep his side level. Then in the second half, with his side under more pressure, he went bravely in for a ball and had a nasty collision with Tiffert for his pains. That moment and the delay for treatment, just took the steam out of the building Seattle momentum, and by the time they'd regained it, they were into the final scheduled minutes and a little panic was creeping in to their decision making.</p> <p>There's a lot to admire about Salt Lake's game management and the way that just at the end a half chance for Saborio might have executed a perfect smash and grab raid. As it was Salt Lake rode their luck a little towards the end (on another night Rosales' shot could have screwed off Beckerman's heel and<em> inside</em> the post) but you can't say that they didn't earn the 0-0 draw they take back to Rio Tinto.&#xa0;</p> <p>So we now essentially have a wild card game hosted by Real Salt Lake for a place in the Western Final. These two sides have only one goal between them in four encounters now - you can't see it opening up in the fifth, but perhaps if Seattle could somehow score an early one it could change the complexion of this fascinating match up. To do so they need to beat Rimando. Surely he can't play like this again. Can he?</p> <p>Thanks for all your tweets and emails. Sorry I couldn't use all of them.

At the other end Gspurning was on hand to make some saves that were less dramatic, but just as vital, including rushing out to execute a perfect sweeper's tackle outside his own box.</p> <p>Salt Lake will be the happier side to be going in level at half time and looking at the first half they will feel that they'll have at least one chance in the second half to take something more from this game, as they did when the sides met earlier in the season. Seattle for their part, just look to be lacking a cutting edge (maybe an Eddie Johnson shaped cutting edge...), but perhaps as the game goes on, they'll be able to pull this defense out of shape a little more decisively, as they seek their first ever aggregate playoff lead. You suspect that with RSL's ability to manage these playoff games, Seattle will need a goal here to put pressure on Salt Lake at home.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-509487e0b579f74bac764992\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-03T02:56:32.544Z\">2.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">HALF TIME: SEATTLE 0 REAL SALT LAKE 0</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Half time thoughts in a moment</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-509487c4b579f74bac764991\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-03T02:56:04.413Z\">2.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">45 mins +2</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Parke picks up a yellow for barging into Espindola.

To finish 2nd in a strong Western Conference is no mean feat, and anyone tempted to write them off as an ageing squad after last season, sat up and took notice when they came back to beat the Galaxy 3-1 at the Home Depot Center on opening weekend. From there, RSL hovered near the top of the standings all year, beat the Galaxy at home again, and faced tonight\u2019s opponents three times without conceding a goal (though only scoring one - a recurring theme as the campaign went on). They never quite figured out San Jose (if losing 5-0 on one occasion can be called \u201cnever quite figuring it out\u201d), but generally Jason Kreis made his men into awkward opponents for most sides.&#xa0;</p> <p>The gamble though was keeping this team, that had gone so close to the Champions League title last year, together for one more tilt in spring 2013. With that in mind, perhaps the most significant game for RSL this season was not against MLS opposition, but the 0-0 draw with Herediano that saw them eliminated from the CCL ten days ago. Jason Kreis may now extensively overhaul this side in the off-season - this MLS Cup campaign could be the last one for a core group of players who\u2019ve been the exemplars of the modestly assembled, technically drilled, team-spirited MLS side.</p> <p>The problem lately has been goals though - so just about everything depends on Saborio staying fit for their Cup run, as Espindola has been a little fitful on the goalscoring front this season. As the previous clips show, on his day, Saborio can electrify any game. That second goal in last year\u2019s first leg was just a dagger of a goal...</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-509475f7b579f74bac764983\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-03T01:40:08.068Z\">1.40am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Seattle Sounders</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It\u2019s been a curious season for the Sounders. They\u2019ve brought in players like Gspurning, Johnson and Tiffert, as well as the bonus return of Steve Zakuani from injury, who\u2019s been like a new signing for them. All of those players have done well: Tiffert has given the midfield a focus point to link defense and attack alongside Alonso; Johnson has broken the club regular season scoring record; Zakuani looks to have added a thoughtful dimension, beyond raw speed, to his game; and Gspurning, as we\u2019ve noted elsewhere, would have been a much more celebrated presence had he not been injured early in his tenure replacing Kasey Keller (though on his return to the team he has demonstrably revived their defensive fortunes).&#xa0;</p> <p>But for every step forward there was a step back. Like LA, Seattle suffered a humbling CCL quarter final defeat, and it cast a pall over an otherwise solid start to their season. They beat LA 2-0 at home with Fredy Montero scoring his first goal of the season (and a beauty it was too), but lost Gspurning to injury in the same game. A nine game winless streak followed soon after. Then Seattle\u2019s Open Cup run seemed to be on cruise control for an amazing fourth consecutive trophy, yet they <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/aug/09/us-open-cup-2012-final-sporting-kansas-city-seattle-sounders\">came off the rails against Sporting KC in the final</a>, when a retaken penalty in the shootout tilted the game irreversibly away from them. They took care of business in their CCL group and seemed to be on cruise control to ease into a high playoff seeding, but slipped up to LA last week, and now find themselves willing on 9th seed Houston, as their only possible opponent in a home MLS Cup final.</p> <p>It\u2019s made their progress appear somewhat <em>treacly</em> - what should have been the next step is looking like a transition year. The only way to alter that impression now, woule appear to be by wining MLS Cup.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-509472f995cb1506d2444773\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-03T01:28:28.295Z\">1.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So here we are again. Seattle Sounders in the post-season, trying to overcome their surprising inability to turn Open Cup prowess into a deep MLS Cup run. Last year, they arrived in the playoffs hard on the heels of eventual winners LA Galaxy, but any hopes of challenging the Galaxy for the Western Conference title was ended at this stage last year, by the opponents they face tonight, the perennially impressive Real Salt Lake.</p> <p>My favorite one-off game of last seasons\u2019 playoffs was the technical battle between LA Galaxy and RSL in the Western Conference final, but for sheer theater, the series between these two sides was hard to beat.</p> <p>Last year it was Seattle who had the notional home advantage going into this game, only to leave themselves with a mountain to climb, after Real Salt Lake hit three perfectly timed goals in the first leg at the Rio Tinto.&#xa0;</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlmFzC6gJ4A\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SlmFzC6gJ4A?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s always a good time to score a goal, but RSL\u2019s goals each seemed to arrive just as Seattle were beginning to gather a little momentum.

  "<p>Mikel Delzangles, who has established himself among the top tier of international racing in the last three years, was the only European trainer to saddle a winner on the first day of the Breeders' Cup meeting at Santa Anita as Flotilla took the Juvenile Fillies' Turf under Christophe Lemaire.</p> <p>Two leading British-based contenders, Sky Lantern and The Fugue, suffered troubled runs on the tight turf track and only The Fugue made the frame, finishing third behind Zagora in the Filly &amp; Mare Turf.</p> <p>Sky Lantern, ridden by Richard Hughes, finished eighth behind Flotilla but her jockey never had a chance to launch a serious challenge. Hughes tried to find space turning in but was nudged back towards the inside and was facing a wall of horses from that point as Lemaire steered Flotilla to victory from a position three-wide on the turn.</p> <p>The Fugue was trapped on the rail after a slightly slow start and William Buick suffered similar problems in the home stretch. Javier Castellano, on Zagora, was in a better position in the straight and ensured he got first run on The Fugue, who finally had the chance to quicken well inside the final furlong with the winner gone beyond recall.</p> <p>Delzangles secured the first big win of his career when Makfi, a cast-off from Marcus Tregoning's yard in Lambourn, took the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket and he arrived at Santa Anita after a stop-off in Australia to check on the wellbeing of Dunaden, last year's Melbourne Cup winner, before his attempt to win the race again next Tuesday.</p> <p>Delzangles now has the backing of the Aga Khan as well as Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa al Thani, the owner of Flotilla, and seems sure to be a major force in world racing for years to come.</p> <p>\"I knew the horse in front of me [Watsdachances] was a good chance and he was travelling very well, so instead of going wide outside I just kept following this horse and he found his improvement a little earlier than me,\" Lemaire said. \"But after that I had plenty of space on the outside to come and to let my filly stretch and use a big strike.\"</p> <p>Hughes said after the race that he had \"plenty of horse but nowhere to go. Usually in these kind of races, something will open up but today there was no hole at all.\"</p> <p>Fame And Glory, the 2011 winner of the Ascot Gold Cup, has been retired to stud after finishing tailed off in his first race on dirt in the Breeders' Cup Marathon. Jamie Spencer's mount was being ridden with a circuit to run and started to drop away soon afterwards. The winner of the race was Calidoscopio, who is trained in Argentina by Guillermo Frankel.</p> <p>D Wayne Lukas, already the most successful trainer in Breeders' Cup history, became the oldest trainer to win a race at the meeting when the 15-1 outsider Hightail upset the favourite, Merit Man, in the opening Juvenile Sprint.</p> <p>Now aged 77, Lukas had not saddled a winner at the meeting since 2005. \"At my age it's significant,\" Lukas said. \"I always thought we could get one more. But I still have the passion for it and I train every day and ride every day and, if they will give us something to work with, we got a chance.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Brighton manager, Gus Poyet, emotionally branded Neil Warnock a \"hypocrite\" following a remarkable draw against Leeds United, which included two goals from Craig Mackail-Smith, three penalties awarded and a result that flattered the away side.</p> <p>Mackail-Smith, who almost joined Leeds during the summer, scored twice before his second penalty of the evening was saved by Paddy Kenny, ensuring Luciano Becchio's deflection on Michael Brown's shot earned Leeds a point.</p> <p>Poyet, who spent 12 months at Elland Road as the assistant manager six years ago, was scathing of Lee Mason's decision to award Leeds a penalty in the first half after Luke Varney went down under the challenge of Bruno Saltor.</p> <p>\"I try to be calm and not get involved in all this but what would have happened if one of my players dived, the way that Mr Varney dived? What would Mr Warnock say? He would probably destroy him. Should I?\" he said. \"Everybody talks about the rest but they don't talk about themselves. If it was my player he dived but because it was his player he was pushed. It's a funny one, we call it hypocrisy. He's in the list of hypocrites now, Neil, unfortunately. He went to the other side \u2013 hypocrite.\"</p> <p>Poyet was also unhappy that Brown remained on the pitch following a foul on Andrea Orlandi that resulted in a yellow card in the 10th minute and subsequent perceived infringements.</p> <p>He added: \"Mr Brown, who had an absolutely fantastic game and I'm pleased for Michael because I played with him, but he shouldn't have been on the pitch and everyone knows that.\"</p> <p>Albion's potent attacking force of Will Buckley, Ashley Barnes, Orlandi and Mackail-Smith, full of energy and creativity, combined to great effect and caused Leeds serious problems until the penalty that opened the scoring after 16 minutes.</p> <p>Buckley danced through the United defence and tumbled over the challenge of the visiting captain, Lee Peltier. Mackail-Smith made no mistake from the spot, blasting straight down the middle of Kenny's goal.</p> <p>Brighton should have been two up but for a horrendous miss from Orlandi. A swift break down the right saw the ball lifted to the far post but the Spanish winger could only divert it into the turf and woefully over the bar \u2013 a bad miss, but nothing compared with Varney's howler for Leeds against Southampton in midweek.</p> <p>The referee then adjudged that Saltor had shoved Varney in the area, levelling things up and making it one penalty apiece as El-Hadji Diouf equalised.</p> <p>Two minutes into the second half Brighton regained control after Leeds allowed Buckley time on the left to pull the ball back across goal, where Mackail-Smith guided it in via a slight deflection.</p> <p>Warnock's side somehow found themselves level with 25 minutes remaining, Brown sweeping a shot goalwards from the edge of the area and seeing it glance off Becchio to take it past Thomas Kuszczak.</p> <p>The drama was not over as Sam Byram hauled Mackail-Smith down and Mason awarded the third penalty of the match, a feat he had also managed in Wednesday night's Capital One Cup tie between Chelsea and Manchester United. However, the Brighton striker was denied his hat-trick by an excellent save from Kenny.</p> <p>\"I think it was a super point. A lot of teams would have gone under, a never-say-die attitude instead of going under,\" said Warnock. \"Gus is not happy, is he? He wants to win a game of football. It was nice to show a bit of guts and Yorkshire grit. Paddy Kenny, I thought he showed what a cheap buy he was.\"</p> <p>When asked about the contentious decisions, he said: \"They're on about Brown should have got sent off, somebody says Luke Varney dived, well he got pushed, you can see he got pushed.\"</p> <p>One manager was certainly happier than the other but Poyet was pleased with Brighton's display. \"I enjoy watching my team play,\" he said. \"I would pay to watch them play football.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"They call me Fearless Felix,\" says the man who, with nonchalant courage, fell to earth faster than the speed of sound. Less than three weeks ago, Felix Baumgartner reached an altitude of 128,100 feet in a small capsule attached to a helium balloon before he plummeted back down again through 24 miles of cold blackness at a top speed of 833.9 miles per hour.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/video/2012/oct/15/felix-baumgartner-skydive-spin-video\" title=\"\">His space jump</a> was watched live on YouTube by more than eight million people, and the fevered reaction online was matched by saturation coverage in the traditional media. As a curiously driven man, who had dreamed of flying ever since he was a five-year-old boy in Austria, drawing detailed pictures of&#xa0;himself soaring through the sky, Baumgartner had achieved his greatest ambition. He had moved from the often-illegal activity of base-jumping \u2013 having blagged his way past lax security at some of the world tallest buildings so his daredevil talents could be noticed \u2013 and become one of the world's most celebrated men.</p> <p>Baumgartner sits in a plush chair in a London hotel and arches a wry eyebrow at his cartoonish nickname. \"You and I know Fearless Felix doesn't really exist,\" he says, quietly, and more thoughtfully than might be expected. \"He might seem like a cool guy, but I've had to address a real psychological battle. It's been way harder than stepping out into space.\"</p> <p>He may be a certified celebrity, with an American twang to his Austrian accent, but he talks with the zeal of an ordinary man who has just survived an extraordinary experience. Baumgartner also uses the very human confines of psychological frailty, rather than the vast expanse of space, to frame his achievement. A canny publicist, the 43-year-old is smart enough to recognise that there is real strength in admitting moments of weakness. But there is also something surprisingly moving in his&#xa0;revelations that the source of his suffocating fear was an old-fashioned spacesuit.</p> <p>\"I feared and hated the suit because of my desire for freedom. I started skydiving because I loved the idea of freedom. But you get trapped in a spacesuit, and people are adding weights to it every day.</p> <p>\"They'd say, 'Right, we need oxygen bottles,' and then a couple of weeks later it would be: 'You need a chest bag.' That chest bag became bigger and bigger and the suit is twice my normal weight. Skydiving is now no fun at all. It's scary. I remember my first dive with this suit. I&#xa0;was standing at the exit at 30,000 feet, and it felt like my very first skydive. The same fear from 25 years ago is back. It never felt good in that suit because it never became a second skin.</p> <p>\"Normally, when I skydive, even in winter, I wear very thin gloves. I want to be flexible, with fast reactions. But a spacesuit slows you down. You have big gloves and you cannot move your head very well. A natural movement, when you pull your chute, is to look up. But with the suit you cannot do this. So now I have two mirrors on my gloves.</p> <p>\"You open the chute and you look down at the mirror to see if it's fully inflated. Every skill I had developed over the years became pretty useless as soon as I stepped into the space suit. And after 25 years as a professional, it makes you feel weak and exposed.\"</p> <p>Baumgartner cut a lonely figure as he&#xa0;prepared to leap into exultation or oblivion. But his vulnerability was bound up in claustrophobia. \"I only started getting anxious if I was in the suit more than an hour. You can fight your way through an hour. But if it takes five hours you're never going to win that battle. So that's why I had to address it.\"</p> <p>The problem became so distressing that Baumgartner required psychiatric help. \"This is the first time I needed [psychological] help,\" he winces. \"It was so embarrassing in the beginning. They'd say things like, 'How would you describe what happened, to your son?'\"</p> <p>He scrunches up his face. \"I don't have a son. So I didn't feel like talking to my imaginary son. But at the same time, I thought: 'If it gets rid of my anxiety, I'll talk to my invisible son.'\"</p> <p>Suddenly a sombre voice booms out: \"Attention please, this is an emergency.\"</p> <p>Baumgartner's eyes widen. \"Is this real?\" he asks.</p> <p>\"Please leave the building now by the nearest available exit \u2026 do not use the lifts or escalators.\"</p> <p>Fearless Felix and I sit tight and keep talking. Joe Kittinger, the 84-year-old who set the previous record for the highest space jump of 19 miles in 1960, and became Baumgartner's chief adviser, pops his white-haired head around the corner. \"It's a real emergency,\" he says.</p> <p>\"We're relaxed,\" Baumgartner quips.</p> <p>\"Good luck,\" Kittinger says drily as he&#xa0;moves towards the exit.</p> <p>\"Hey Joe,\" Baumgartner shouts, \"see you in heaven \u2026 \"</p> <p>He returns to his story. \"Can you imagine how embarrassing it is to have two strangers listening to you talk to your invisible son about your deepest fears?\"</p> <p>Even the smell of the suit unsettled him. \"It was the smell of rubber. That was always the key moment. But my anxiety started the day before. I would not sleep well, and then you have to drive to Lancaster [in California, where his test capsule was based]. When you get over that last hill you can see Lancaster down there \u2026 and you know the suit is waiting. The psychiatrist called it the 'train of negative thoughts'. I was always riding that dark train. He said you have to get off it with positive thinking. It's easy to say, and hard to accomplish. Still, we did it. I started to feel strong again.\"</p> <p>Yet Baumgartner had walked away from the project for six months. It was only when he saw footage of a replacement doing his job in testing that he was shocked into returning. \"I felt jealous,\" he says, \"and I thought: 'You're not supposed to be in my suit.' I saw the BBC film yesterday [Space Dive, which airs on BBC2 on Sunday] and it's disturbing because you see my name on the helmet, then you realise: 'Hey, that's not Felix. Some other guy is in there.' No offence to Rob [the test pilot]. We had this big test and they couldn't say: 'Hey, we'll skip it because Felix is too weak.' But it really hurt my feelings when I saw&#xa0;Rob in my suit. It felt like I'd been replaced. Of course, it was part of the journey, but when you're inside that situation you never like drama.\"</p> <p>As if to remind us that drama can happen anywhere, a representative of&#xa0;Red Bull, the Austrian company that spent over $18m to help Baumgartner fulfil his dream, urges us to follow her.</p> <p>\"If you see fire, tell us,\" Baumgartner says laconically.</p> <p>\"This is real,\" she says, calmly.</p> <p>\"OK,\" Baumgartner laughs. We leave the hotel and Baumgartner keeps talking, intently. \"The toughest moment was when I lost my team after I came back from Austria,\" he says. \"My psychiatrist told me: 'Nobody thinks you can do it anymore. You have to get your leadership back.' I went into this room and I could see everybody sitting on the other side of this table. All my friends. And just by the body language I could tell: 'Nobody thinks I can do it anymore.'\"</p> <p>Did Joe doubt him? \"Everybody,\" he says sadly. As a former soldier and a self-proclaimed team-leader and man of action, Baumgartner was shaken by the loss of faith in him. \"Art Thompson [the project director]. Mike Todd [his life support engineer]. I never thought Mike would doubt me because he was like my father. He was the key guy in those quiet moments when he was dressing me in the locker room \u2013 like a boxer with his coach before he goes to fight. But he was sitting on the other side now. Nobody had faith in me anymore. That was a really bad moment. This claustrophobia was the only weakness I had. It's not my fault. It's just in my mind.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398792107\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/7/1349624423938/Felix-Baumgartner-010.jpg\" alt=\"Felix Baumgartner\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felix Baumgartner sits in his capsule during preparations for the final manned flight of the Red Bull Stratos mission in Roswell, New Mexico Photograph: Joerg Mitter/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joerg Mitter/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Baumgartner's words are poignant rather than plaintive \u2013 but he sounds like a sports jock when describing the \"game plan\" and \"strategy\" he developed to regain control. \"I thought, whatever it takes to get my leadership back, I'm willing to do it. After five days it was working. Two weeks later, everyone was positive and we knew I was ready.\"</p> <p>Doubt, however, still plagued him. \"The worry is I won't fly supersonic or, in the worst-case scenario, I'm not as fast as Joe Kittinger was in 1960. You have to explain to the world that, 52 years later, you're slower than Joe? It's another pressure. I don't think people get what it means to do something when the whole world \u2013 from the pope to the president of the US \u2013 is watching you.\"</p> <p>His problems continued. As he floated towards the 24 mile-high mark \u2013 it took almost three hours for the balloon to lift his Red Bull Stratos capsule into space \u2013 Baumgartner's visor began to cloud as he exhaled. The prospect of doing the jump \"half-blind\" threatened the mission, and he had to endure various tests before it was established that his equipment was working.</p> <p>He had less time once he had left his capsule, and begun to whirl through space at a speed which sent him into an inevitable spin. \"I had one minute to find a solution. While spinning, I'm thinking: 'Should I push the button to release my drogue chute, to stop that spin? But that would mean it's over and I'm not going to fly supersonic \u2013 so should I tough it out and find a solution?</p> <p>\"I had to maintain my cool and this is what I've been doing the last 25 years \u2013 being focused and not freaking out. In my head I was cool-minded. My worst fear was not dying, but failing to fly supersonic. If you're at 3.6 Gs for six seconds, it fires the drogue chute. I was rotating, but it was hard to tell how many Gs I was at. I felt I had it under control and, hey, I'm not dying. But I&#xa0;couldn't know how close the drogue chute was to firing. In the end it was OK, but it was difficult, and that's why Joe held the record for 52 years. Lots of people underestimated it.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398792108\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350287356193/Felix-Baumgartner-skydive-010.jpg\" alt=\"Felix Baumgartner skydive\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felix Baumgartner jumps out of the capsule on his way to breaking the world record for the highest free fall in history. Photograph: Handout/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Baumgartner thinks hard when asked about his jump's sweetest moment. \"I&#xa0;had a couple of good moments,\" he eventually says. \"One was standing with my feet outside the capsule just before I&#xa0;stepped off. We'd been working towards that for five years. As soon as I was standing there \u2013 completely released from all the cables \u2013 I knew it was going to happen. That was a big relief and a really unique, outstanding moment.</p> <p>\"And then when you open your parachute you know it's over \u2013 I'm still alive! Mike Todd was the last person I saw before going up. He'd said, 'OK, see you on the ground, buddy.' But you could tell he wasn't 100% sure. I wasn't either. We prepare for the worst but hope for the best. And then, three hours later, Mike is the guy I see first after it's all over. Mike worried about me like I'm his son. But when he's happy he looks 16 again. I was looking forward to seeing that smile.\"</p> <p>This is Baumgartner at his most likable; he is also touching when describing the emotional toll on his mother, Ava, whose sister was buried just a week before he made his jump. His life is not&#xa0;always simple and next week his lawyers will appeal his conviction for punching a lorry driver during a traffic jam in 2010. And so how will a man consumed by outrageous challenges rekindle the intensity of his space jump? \"I don't have to,\" he replies,&#xa0;confirming his plan to become a&#xa0;rescue-helicopter pilot. \"I&#xa0;reached a peak and I don't have to top it again. A lot of kids now think of me as&#xa0;Fearless Felix \u2013 but I hope I can make fear cool. All these kids can know that Felix also has fear. So they can address their own fears. I did it \u2013 at first I&#xa0;would consider the&#xa0;suit a handicap. And handicapped people have to find a way to live with their handicap. The suit was&#xa0;my worst enemy, but it became my&#xa0;friend \u2013 because the higher you go, the more you need the suit. It gives you&#xa0;the only way to survive. I learned to&#xa0;love the suit up there. That's an even bigger message than flying supersonic.\"</p> <p><em>Space Dive is on BBC2 on Sunday at 8.30pm</em></p>",

  "<p>At the end of the month, my life begins. No, I haven't been doorstepped by some cult, nor am I a preternaturally talented foetus. It's nothing as momentous or otherworldly as that, but it does, supposedly, mark something grand, poignant, possibly even final, for me. That's right, I turn 40. The precise moment when, according to modern folklore, life begins.</p> <p>Now, seeing as though you're probably anticipating a spewed-up litany of woe-is-me disillusionment, allow me to head you off at the pass. I am perfectly calm and sanguine. Even my wife's ribald mocking (she's 32) after I received an invitation to an NHS health check \u2013 \"for people between the ages of 40 and 74\" \u2013 has failed to raise my blood pressure. Getting older has never fazed me. Which isn't to say that something isn't bugging me.</p> <p>I'm married. I have two children. I've owned (and sold) a house. I've been in love at least three times in my life. I've cheated on a girlfriend (it wasn't big or clever) and am pretty sure I've been cheated on too (karma). I've experienced fluctuations in my career. I was deputy editor of a music magazine at 28; I travelled the world, stayed in fancy hotels, drank ludicrously expensive bottles of wine, went to the best gigs and clubs for free. I have also been made redundant and experienced intense feelings of anxiety and stress as a result.</p> <p>Yet I still don't feel like a grownup. As a child, I assumed that one day I'd wake up and&#xa0;feel like a man: physically, emotionally, philosophically, whatever. I thought a switch would flick in my brain&#xa0;and that was it \u2013 I would be a man. A fully fledged, grown-up man. Clearly, that never happened, and I know it never will. When my dad hit that milestone, 27 years ago, I looked at him and recognised that he was a man, an adult, a grownup. When I try to compare and contrast my feelings about myself today, and what I thought about my dad then, there is a chasm between the two.</p> <p>He was a man; I am, well, if not playing at being a grownup as my wife and I sometimes joke (\"You mean, we get to take this baby home? On our own? With no one to check up on us?\") then a sorry facsimile of one. I don't have a pension, my savings are pitiful and, as a freelancer, I'm only a few bad months away from penury. My dad wore a suit to work. Most days, I could get by in my pyjamas.</p> <p>So what does being a man really mean? There's only one person to ask. The man to whom I still turn when I have grave concerns about this adult lark \u2013 my dad.</p> <p>But how to broach the subject? I've never been backwards in coming forwards when I want to ask him about mending a fence, obtaining financial advice or buying a car, but talking about my feelings \u2013 let alone his feelings \u2013 I'm not sure we've ever done that apart from one occasion in 1990 when we went to the pub after I was having a spot of girlfriend trouble.</p> <p>My dad was born in Sheffield in 1945. He married my mum when he was 23, the same year he bought his first house. I emerged at the tail end of 1972 and my brother Richard followed a year and a half later. In 1982, my youngest brother, Robert, was born. In the summer of 1985, a few months before he turned 40, we moved from Boston, Lincolnshire, to Taunton, Somerset, on account of my dad getting a new job as the director of a timber manufacturer.</p> <p>My elder son, Stanley, is two and a half; my younger, George, is four months old. I've been married for just over a year. We live in rented accommodation. The differences couldn't be starker. So what was Dad thinking when he hit 40?</p> <p>\"My focus was primarily on my family and our recent move,\" he begins. \"I wasn't thinking inwardly or being introspective. I was just concentrating on my new job, making a success of that and ensuring we were all settled in our new surroundings.\"</p> <p>Did he consider himself a man by the time he reached 40? \"I had done since I was in my late 20s. I felt I had reached manhood when you and Richard were born. Until then I felt like an overgrown adolescent. But by the time I had hit 30 \u2013 was married, had a mortgage and had kids \u2013 I definitely felt like a man. It wasn't something I really thought about.\"</p> <p>Aged 30, I was still living a life of shameless self-indulgence, and refused to contemplate anything broadly resembling responsibility. Extended adolescence they called it. Was I an immature fool? I daresay I was.</p> <p>\"You have to understand, we \u2013 my friends and I \u2013 never talked about our feelings in the 70s and 80s,\" he recalls. \"Things were different then. Once your mother and I got married I stopped socialising with my friends on my own. I assumed I had different responsibilities and couldn't carry on in the same vein.\"</p> <p>Then he tells me something that does make me stop and think. He says that when he was growing up, he thought you would gradually grow into a man, that it was something you became through experience. And, in his estimation, that's what happened. He left school at 17, and over a 13-year period, during which he acquired a job, got married, bought a house and had kids, he evolved into a man.</p> <p>I did things differently. After school, I went to college and then university in Manchester. After graduation, I spent three or four years prancing around Manchester. It wasn't until I was nearly 27, and had moved to London, that I got my first proper job \u2013 a full 10 years after my dad had begun his career.</p> <p>From there, my life experiences have broadly followed his \u2013 give or take an ill-advised wish to start a club night with my mates in my mid-30s, or a fleeting wish to go travelling (not backpacking, though) with my girlfriend, now my wife, when we first got together. OK, the dying embers of my hedonistic youth probably didn't end until around 2006 when I went to my last nightclub \u2013 \"I always thought good luck to you when you were still going out at 30,\" my dad reassures me kindly \u2013 but maybe I'm not quite the helpless case I feared.</p> <p>I have matured, albeit slowly and discreetly. Looking to the future, the happiness and fulfilment of Stanley and George is paramount. I can see a time when we might leave London. I no longer obsessively look at people's ages to see when they achieved something. Why did it matter how old Robert de Niro was in Taxi Driver? I had never acted, had no desire to act \u2026 yet I persisted. No longer.</p> <p>Do I feel grown up? No. Does that matter? Probably not. It's what I do that counts.</p> <p>In other words \u2013 and I can't believe I'm writing this \u2013 turning 40, being a man and growing up is not about arriving at some mythical destination but, rather, embarking on a memorable journey.</p> <p>And who taught me that? My dad.</p>",
  "<p><strong>My first baby is due soon and I am wrestling with whether to contact my father, who is an alcoholic. My parents divorced when I was young and, despite contact orders, he didn't turn up to see us when it was arranged and failed to pay maintenance. When we did see him he invariably took me and my sister (two years older) to the pub or supermarket.</strong></p> <p><strong>I'm 32 and since I was 10, I've seen him only once \u2013 10 years ago. He just stopped turning up to see us, with no explanation.&#xa0; In the meantime, my stepfather arrived and has played the role of dad with some difficulties. My mother and I are very close.</strong></p> <p><strong>Last Christmas, I received a card from my father via my sister (he does not know where I live). In it, he asked for contact and wrote that he'd like to know something of my life. It is the first time he has sent me such a message. My impending motherhood is influencing my thoughts, as is the knowledge that he isn't particularly well. A friend's father recently died unexpectedly in difficult circumstances; there were inevitable reflections on what is important, forgiveness and the shortness of time.</strong></p> <p><strong>I don't want my father to be part of my life. But neither do I want him to make me behave in a way I feel is morally wrong. I have concluded that if I were to be in touch I would not fulfil my need for a loving father or grandfather, as he is incapable of that.&#xa0;My husband has suggested that I may be projecting failure on to my father without knowing whether being&#xa0;in touch would be as unsatisfying as I imagine. I'm not sure, but that's possible. &#xa0;</strong></p> <p><strong><em>Anon, via email</em></strong></p> <p>I think there's an area between not contacting your father at all and letting him 100% back into your life. You are absolutely right to feel cautious. Is he still drinking?</p> <p>But I wonder how you would feel if you heard that your father regretted his actions and wanted to make good? Would it be so easy to turn away? It's easy to give up on abandonment and disappointment, but not so easy when there might be something more positive on offer. And there could be. As you've said, when your father is dead there will be no more chances.</p> <p>I contacted Quentin Spencer, a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist and family counsellor (<a href=\"http://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/\" title=\"\">psychotherapy.org.uk</a>), who had this to say: \"I think you should try to find a way of meeting with your father, for the following reasons:</p> <p>\"He has asked about you for what may be the first time.</p> <p>\"If alcohol usage is seen as an illness rather than a choice, he may not have been entirely responsible for all the disappointments he inflicted.</p> <p>\"You owe it to your future child to explore the possibility of a second grandfather.</p> <p>\"Research has shown that fathers who lose touch with their children greatly regret it, although it may appear (falsely) that they feel nothing, do not care, and were entirely responsible for the fading of contact. If he were to die soon, it would be too late to give him the chance to make some emotional contact and express some of what he feels.\"</p> <p>Spencer points out that this is a \"subjective, male and fairly one-sided view\", but I thought this might be helpful here. Spencer also acknowledges that there may be \"risks in re-establishing contact, the main one probably being emotional pain\".</p> <p>I'd like to add that it sounds as if you're in a good place now so you may be more resilient than you once were.</p> <p>I don't know how far along your pregnancy is, but you may want to wait until after the baby is born before contacting your father. Ultimately, please think about what's best for you \u2013 not your sister, mother, father, stepfather or anyone else, just <em>you</em>. Also think about the mode of contact that would make you feel more in control. It might be writing a letter or calling him if you have his telephone number.</p> <p>I would probably advise writing as it's more at arm's length, and you may need that at the moment. If you do write and he doesn't write back, I hope any pain you may feel will be outweighed by knowing you did right by your own moral code. I'd be particularly interested to hear from others who have been in this situation.</p> <h2>Your problems solved<br></h2> <p>Contact Annalisa Barbieri, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU or email\u2008annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.

  "<p>A moment after the blast hit them, Stephen Gault knew his father was dead. Seconds earlier they had been standing side by side in the street chatting. Now they were lying on the ground, pressed up against some railings.</p> <p>\"The&#xa0;top of Dad's head wasn't there any more,\" says Stephen. \"I knew he had gone.\"</p> <p>The time was 10.45am, the date was 8 November 1987 \u2013 Remembrance Sunday \u2013 and the place was <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/8/newsid_2515000/2515113.stm\" title=\"\">the cenotaph in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland</a>.</p> <p>Stephen's family were Protestants. Both his parents were in the security forces \u2013 his father, Samuel, who was 49, had retired two years earlier from the <a href=\"http://www.royalulsterconstabulary.org/\" title=\"\">Royal Ulster Constabulary</a>, and his mother, Gladys, then 47, was a serving member of the Ulster Defence Regiment. Suddenly, at 18, Stephen was fatherless.</p> <p>His life, and those of his family, had been ripped apart by an IRA bomb.</p> <p>Stephen is now 43. The injuries he suffered that day mean he is in almost constant pain and is unable to work. At this time of year, as Remembrance Day gets closer, he tends to feel much worse, physically and psychologically. This year, as the 25th anniversary approaches, he's been even harder hit&#xa0;than usual.</p> <p>But there's one bright light in Stephen's life \u2013 his wife, Sharon. \"She's the most loving, caring woman in the world,\" says Stephen. \"She's bubbly and warm, and I'm so lucky to have her.\" But Sharon, 32, is also a Roman Catholic and making their marriage work across the religious divide of Northern Ireland has been a kind of microcosm of the peace process that has changed the face of the province in the years since that day in Enniskillen when 11 people were killed and 63 were injured.</p> <p>Stephen doesn't remember exactly when he discovered that the young woman he had met at the town golf club was a Catholic. The funny thing was, he says, that his mother was beginning to despair that he'd ever find anyone at all. \"I was in my early 30s, still living at home. After Dad died, Mum was alone, and I knew I had to be there for her. But she was desperate for me to meet someone. She used to joke that she wouldn't even mind if I found myself a Catholic.\"</p> <p>For her part, Sharon had no idea of the history of the man she was getting close to. \"I was born in the south of Ireland, and at the time of the bombing I was living in Surrey,\" she says. \"We moved to Enniskillen in 1991 because it's where my mum came from \u2013 I remember our friends in England thought we were mad because everyone knew how bad the Troubles&#xa0;were.\"</p> <p>In Enniskillen, Sharon enrolled at a Catholic school. \"The communities were quite separate, so most of the people I knew were Catholics,\" she says. After school she got a job with a fashion retailer, but when a friend asked her to help with her catering business at the golf club, she was happy to lend a hand. \"That's where I first met Stephen,\" she remembers.</p> <p>As their relationship progressed, she learned that his father was dead but didn't know the circumstances. \"I suppose everyone just assumed I knew and Stephen never talked about it. I went home to meet his mother, Gladys, and she was lovely.</p> <p>\"One day, when we'd been going out for a couple of months, he said, did you know I was standing beside my dad when he died? I thought it must have been a traffic accident; but then he mentioned the cenotaph and suddenly it all clicked into place.\"</p> <p>She says she's glad, though, that she didn't know about Stephen's history when they were first together. \"I think I might have overcompensated for being a Catholic, especially when I met Gladys,\" she says. \"But by the time I found out, we were already friends.\"</p> <p>Stephen says Sharon's faith made no difference to the way he felt about her. \"Too many lives have been ruined by people in Northern Ireland putting religion first,\" he says. \"I was determined not to do that. When I met Sharon, I saw the person she was, not the church she went to.\"</p> <p>But when the couple got engaged in 2003, there were whispers. \"There were people saying, 'Look at him. His father was murdered by the IRA, what's he thinking of, marrying a Catholic?' No one said it to my face, but I've no doubt it went on \u2013 differences are very entrenched here and marrying across the religious divide is still a big deal, even when you haven't been through what my family have.\"</p> <p>Sharon, meanwhile, started to plan the wedding \u2013 until reality intervened. \"I'd always had this idea in my mind that I'd walk down the aisle of St Michael's, the Catholic church in Enniskillen \u2013 it's the most gorgeous church,\" she says.</p> <p>But a Catholic priest advised her to think again. \"He said it was going to seem very insensitive to Stephen's family to have to go into a Catholic church after everything that had happened. I realised he was right. I said to Stephen, 'We should get married in a Church of Ireland church \u2013 but we'll have a Catholic priest there as well as the Protestant minister.'\"</p> <p>\"That was a big thing she did,\" says Stephen, \"because she really did love the idea of walking down the aisle of St Michael's. But it shows the person Sharon is \u2013 always willing to put other people's feelings before her own.\"</p> <p>The wedding was, the couple agree, a wonderful occasion. It was the first time many of Sharon's family had been inside a Protestant church \u2013 and the first time some of Stephen's family had met a Catholic priest. \"It really did bring people together in a very positive way,\" says&#xa0;Sharon.</p> <p>But there was, of course, somebody missing: \"I'd have so loved my dad to have been there,\" says Stephen. \"I always looked up to him, I thought the world of him. I'd love him to have met Sharon \u2013 he'd have adored her.</p> <p>\"When I was growing up, I didn't see as much of him as I'd have liked because he was station sergeant \u2013 at the first sign of any disturbance, and there were plenty of them, he'd have to go straight into work.\"</p> <p>Going to work \u2013 for Gladys and Samuel \u2013 was always potentially dangerous. \"There were days I'd go into school and wonder whether I'd still have both my parents by home time,\" Stephen says.</p> <p>\"There was a lot of violence, a lot of deaths. They were desperate times.\"</p> <p>As members of the security forces were continually targeted by the IRA, there was a constant need for caution within the family. \"If we were going out to the shops or for a drive, my parents would always go out first to check there was no bomb underneath our car. Once they knew it was safe, they'd make a signal to us through the window that it was OK to go out on to the road.\"</p> <p>The irony was that after Samuel took early retirement, the danger seemed to have receded. In the months leading up to his death, he was at home while Gladys was out working. It meant he had more time to spend with his sons \u2013 as well as Stephen, there was his older brother, Keith. \"It felt like things were getting calmer, that we were going to all be OK,\" says Stephen. \"I was spending a lot of time with my dad \u2013 we'd recently taken up golf together.\"</p> <p>Remembrance Sunday was always a big event in Enniskillen. \"That Sunday, Dad put on his best suit, as he always would for an occasion like that. And I remember that I, being 18, refused to wear mine: I insisted on wearing a leather jacket I'd bought the day before. They said at the hospital that the jacket saved my life because it was&#xa0;padded and it protected me from the blast.\"</p> <p>Stephen and Samuel were standing near the cenotaph, waiting for Keith to join them. Gladys was at the cathedral getting ready for the ceremony there. \"Keith was delayed getting up to us \u2013 if he'd been on time he'd have been caught in the blast too,\" says Stephen. \"So it was just me and Dad standing there. I remember a policeman had just walked past and nodded to my dad and I'd turned to ask who that was. It was the last thing I ever said to my dad.\"</p> <p>The bomb, says Stephen, felt like being pushed forward by a terrific force. He lost consciousness for several seconds and came round to see his father dead beside him. He remembers a few seconds of eerie silence before pandemonium broke out. \"There were injured people, dead people, everywhere,\" he says. \"I was walking round in a daze, severely concussed \u2013 I remember feeling the blood running down the back of my head. Eventually, someone put me into a police minibus and took me to hospital.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, at the church, Gladys was frantic to find out what had happened to her husband and sons. \"Someone went down to find her and told her that Dad was alive, but I was dead. She was taken to the hospital \u2013 and it was only when she got to the ward and saw me that she found out the truth.\"</p> <p>Stephen was discharged from hospital late that night. \"I remember Keith drove us home; I was in the back seat, Mum in the front. As we were going down the road, Mum turned to us and said, very strongly and very clearly, 'I don't want either of you boys doing anything stupid.' She was afraid we were going to try to retaliate for Dad; she thought we might get caught up with the loyalist cause. She didn't want innocent Catholics to suffer the way we were suffering \u2013 she thought that was totally wrong.\"</p> <p>Stephen never toyed with getting involved in terrorism, but did still hope to follow his father into the RUC. \"From being a wee boy I'd walk around the house in my dad's cap, pretending to be a policeman,\" he says. \"It was all I wanted to do.\" But when he applied a year or so after the bomb, he failed the medical. \"I wasn't fit enough any more. Mum was against me joining. She said she'd lost a husband to the Troubles, she didn't want to lose a son as well.\"</p> <p>Today, Stephen and Sharon live outside Enniskillen, in a beautiful rural area of Fermanagh. Sharon works in the town centre; Stephen, who had to give up work in an electronics factory, is at home. In the aftermath of the explosion, he was thought to be one of the lucky ones \u2013 he seemed to have got away with minor injuries. But in the weeks following the blast, he developed psoriasis linked to the extreme trauma he'd experienced, which has developed into a painful arthritic condition.</p> <p>Over the last few years, Stephen's health has deteriorated, and both his and Sharon's mothers have died. But the couple live in hope of better times, as they always have. Their dream is to have children they can bring up free of violence and hatred.</p> <p>Their children won't be raised as Protestants, says Sharon, and they won't be raised as Catholics. They will be brought up in both denominations equally and taught to value the principles that unite the two churches, not the dogma and politics that divide them. \"We go to my church one Sunday and to Stephen's church the next, and that's the way we'll carry on once we have children,\" she says.</p> <p>\"We'll send them to an integrated school because education is where it all starts. And we'll teach our children that it's people themselves \u2013 not their religion and not their politics \u2013 that matter most of all in life.\"</p>",
  "<p>Maura, nine, is an expert on ancient history. Her brother Sean, six, specialises in the classification of animals. Gavin, the youngest, has an encyclopaedic knowledge of Spiderman \u2013 a little less high-brow, but then he is only three.</p> <p>All three like to hold forth on their chosen subjects \u2013 regardless of whether anyone else is listening or, for that matter, speaking. Family meal-times, admits their mother, Jennifer Cook O'Toole, can be quite a headache-inducing affair.</p> <p>Fortunately, Jennifer and her husband, John, are not averse to delivering impassioned monologues themselves \u2013 about, respectively, the history of monarchy and astronomy \u2013 if the mood takes them.</p> <p>There is, of course, no such thing as a \"normal\" family, and the Cook O'Tooles are more aware of that truism than most. They are a self-styled \"Asper-family\" \u2013 over the past three years all five of them have been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, a high-functioning form of autism.</p> <p>\"This is our normal. We've always been like this, even before we knew why,\" says Jennifer, 36. \"I don't speak for all Aspies, like I don't speak for all women, or all red-heads \u2013 but I definitely can't tell you what it's like to not be any of those things.\"</p> <p>The family is visiting Britain from their home in Charlotte, North Carolina, for the publication of Jennifer's book about social skills for children with Asperger's.</p> <p>Maura's diagnosis, three years ago, was the first. She had been a difficult baby \u2013 crying constantly and vomiting frequently. Her parents soon suspected a physical cause for her distress and, after a long, stressful investigation, she was diagnosed with tethered cord syndrome (a neurological abnormality of the spinal cord) at the age of four, and underwent surgery.</p> <p>Her parents were looking forward to life after years of doctors and hospitals and Maura was now old enough for school. She sat entrance tests for a private school that John and Jennifer felt would best suit her gradually recovering health. The results were surprising \u2013 there was a huge gulf between her scores in verbal and non-verbal reasoning. That led to the diagnosis of Asperger's.</p> <p>A few months later, Jennifer took Sean for a medical check \u2013 at three he was already reading but had poor personal organisation, obsessive interests and avoided eye contact. Doctors agreed that he, too, had Asperger's.</p> <p>John, meanwhile, was seeing a psychologist, at Jennifer's insistence. \"The trauma of having a chronically sick child was huge and John had no close friends to talk to. I felt he needed someone other than me to help,\" she says.</p> <p>The psychologist realised that John was also on the autistic spectrum. The diagnosis surprised the couple, though Jennifer now can't think why. \"It was so obvious \u2013 I always had to tell him to look at me \u2013 I was so busy picking over the children that I wasn't thinking about us. Then I went along to a talk, so I could understand John better, and had this moment of realisation about myself.\"</p> <p>As a child, Jennifer had been taken to numerous psychologists by her mother, who was baffled by her daughter's inability to socialise, only to be told each time that the child was simply too bright for her own good. \"That was ridiculous \u2013 lots of children are very clever but they didn't have the same problems. Actually, I had Asperger's. All of a sudden, things made sense. For me, it was an utter relief.\"</p> <p>Gavin's diagnosis, aged two \u2013 the final piece in the family jigsaw \u2013 was \"a no-brainer\". Jennifer had compiled a file of evidence from the start \u2013 \"the lining up of toys and so on\".</p> <p>Realising that they, as parents, shared the same difficulties as their children was briefly frightening for John and Jennifer. \"Then we took a deep breath and realised we were doing it anyway. The years when Maura was sick kept things in perspective; we just felt even more protective, and knew we could cope.\"</p> <p>The idea that their own special needs could be an advantage to their children occurred soon afterwards. \"A friend whose son also has autism kept asking me questions that seemed obvious to me. I realised I was on to something. I have 36 years of experience \u2013 but I am like them and usually I have made the mistake myself. I can tell them that. We know what it is to feel deficient, other, less. I hope that stops our advice sounding condescending, and that it can save them from some of those feelings.\"</p> <p>The book Jennifer has published is a notebook she began for herself. \"My way of learning these unspoken social rules everyone else just instinctively knew is to write them down. It is a tool for the future. It's like trying to learn a bit of German if you go to live in Germany.\"</p> <p>A section of bullet point reminders offers a glimpse of life with her Asper-family. \"When a door opens, wait for other people to exit before you walk in\", \"Even excuse me becomes an interruption if you keep saying it\", \"Don't change the TV channel if other people are watching the show.\"</p> <p>Following what she calls \"the rules\" is also Jennifer's technique for strengthening her relationship in the face of her own and John's interpersonal weaknesses.</p> <p>The couple see a psychologist together once a month, a requirement Jennifer likens to regular dental check-ups. \"We know we aren't good at communication so we put work in \u2013 and we must set a good example to our children. We make more effort than many couples simply because we have to.</p> <p>\"When Maura was ill and John and I were physically, emotionally and financially exhausted, it was actually the Aspie mindset that kept us moving forward \u2013 we're married, we have to stick at it together. Now sharing that diagnosis is like wearing the same team&#xa0;shirt, a reminder we are on the same side.\"</p> <p>Though they are clearly very happy, Jennifer says that their early relationship was maddening. Flummoxed by the minefields of dating and fashion, she had \"systematically studied\" Just Seventeen magazine and the 1995 dating bestseller, The Rules.</p> <p>On their first date, she was deeply perplexed to learn that John had made absolutely no plans. \"I had learned how it was meant to work. He was supposed to compliment me and then take me to a show or something. After seven months of seeing each other I eventually asked if he thought I was pretty. He said, 'Of course'.\"</p> <p>Much of what Jennifer saw in John she recognised from her father. He died of lung cancer five years ago, never having heard of Asperger's.</p> <p>\"It is obvious to me where my Asperger's comes from. My father never understood how he could be a brilliant litigator in court rooms around the world and yet want to die at parties. He would be so on edge he would bump into people, rock back and forth. He self-medicated continuously with Scotch and cigarettes.\"</p> <p>Jennifer recalls a heartbreaking conversation in which, with tears in his eyes, he told her, \"I'm so glad you don't have the trouble with people that I do.\" (Of course she did, she says, \"but he was easily fooled\".)</p> <p>When he seemed cold in the face of her upsets \u2013 one year she was desperate enough to ask Father Christmas for a friend \u2013 she realises he was simply unable to cope.</p> <p>His loneliness is proof enough to Jennifer that labels should not be feared. \"Parents often say they don't want their children to be labelled with Asperger's, or that people managed fine before the diagnosis existed.</p> <p>\"I can't help but be offended. I feel we are as we should be. The word might be new, but the people aren't. There was just more depression, divorce and suicide. If diagnosis brings the right support, understanding and self-esteem then that is a very good thing.\"</p> <p>Asperger's is only one part of who they are as individuals and as a family though. \"I don't want Asperger's itself to become our special interest. The children go to school and get to be normal kids too. I am also just another mum who sometimes wants to pull her&#xa0;hair out.</p> <p>\"I certainly wouldn't change things \u2013 apart from maybe Spiderman. Two years of hearing about him all the time really is hardgoing.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Asperkid's \u2013 Secret \u2013 Book of Social Rules by Jennifer Cook O'Toole is published by Jessica Kingsley Publishers, for \u00a313.99.

  "<p>There are few things more shocking than a mother killing her own children. But it is, mercifully, very rare indeed, and almost always a last act of desperation or a sign of&#xa0;temporary insanity. Which is why the judgment of Mr Justice Fulford this week, in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/30/woman-admits-killing-two-babies\" title=\"\">the tragic case of&#xa0;Felicia Boots</a>, who suffocated her 10-week-old baby and her one-year-old daughter in May this year, has to be applauded as a sea change in our attitudes to postnatal depression.</p> <p>Judge Fulford did not send Felicia Boots to prison. He accepted a new plea&#xa0;of guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, and placed her under a hospital psychiatric order with the&#xa0;words: \"A&#xa0;prison sentence would be wholly inappropriate \u2026 this is an almost indescribably sad case \u2026 I unreservedly accept that what the defendant did to the two children she and her husband so loved and nurtured was solely the result of psychiatric and bio-physiological factors truly beyond her control.\" What's more, he placed no time limit on&#xa0;the psychiatric order, but left that to&#xa0;the doctors.</p> <p>All of the signs were there. After the birth of her first child, Felicia Boots had been diagnosed with postnatal depression, prescribed antidepressants and had seen a psychiatrist. There was a history of depression in the family \u2013 her&#xa0;brother had committed suicide four years earlier, and she was said to have been \"mentally crushed\" after the breakdown of her first marriage. Felicia and her husband had just moved into a new house, and she seemed unable to cope or complete simple tasks. And then,&#xa0;on this dreadful day, she had been&#xa0;surfing the internet looking for the effects of antidepressants on breastfed babies. She had stopped taking her medication two weeks earlier. Felicia then apparently had a paranoid delusion that her children would be taken into care, and killed them before attempting, and failing, to take her own life.</p> <p>Puerperal psychosis affects roughly one in 1,000 women. Symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, impulses to hurt the baby or the belief that there is&#xa0;something wrong with it. Postnatal depression is a spectrum, with this type of psychosis at one end, and mild \"baby blues\" \u2013 weeping for several days after childbirth \u2013 at the other. But in the middle of these two extremes, many \u2013 if&#xa0;not most \u2013 new mothers experience profound lows as they struggle to adjust&#xa0;or cope with life as it now is.</p> <p>The statistics suggest that roughly a&#xa0;quarter of women experience depression in the first year after childbirth. I&#xa0;believe, however, that the true incidence is probably far higher, for postnatal depression is often missed or&#xa0;misdiagnosed. The symptoms of feeling low and despondent, tired and lethargic, inadequate, irritable, tearful and unable to cope, as well as loss of appetite, insomnia and physical symptoms such as headaches and stomach pains are easily explained away by common postpartum experiences such as broken sleep, changes in marital relations and impaired health as a result&#xa0;of the physiological stresses of pregnancy and childbirth. Women are often reluctant or simply too tired to consult doctors, particularly if they expect having a baby to be nothing but a&#xa0;source of joy. Sometimes they don't even know they are depressed until they&#xa0;emerge from the fog and look back&#xa0;on those grey days.</p> <p>New mothers have good reason to be depressed. They are often coping with radical change in every aspect of their lives at the same time. The experience of&#xa0;childbirth can be physically and psychologically traumatic. Given the&#xa0;lamentable state of some of our maternity wards and the paucity of midwives, countless new mothers experience much more stressful labours&#xa0;than they perhaps need to.</p> <p>Once home, everything feels chaotic, with an endless cycle of chores and broken sleep, an overwhelming sense of&#xa0;responsibility and potential for a sense of inadequacy. How can one possibly know what a tiny baby might need, and am I really up to the task of looking after it, all the time? If the baby has colic, there is also the frustration of never being able to soothe one's own child. And if, as with Felicia Boots, a mother has two children under two years old, there is more than twice the work, and feelings of inadequacy can increase tenfold.</p> <p>New mothers are often trapped at home alone, hundreds of miles away from their own families, as Felicia Boots was. Staggering numbers of couples move, like the Boots did, into new homes with small children or while pregnant, without the social support of local friends and neighbours who know them well. Research shows that low social support is one of the strongest links to postnatal depression. A recent NSPCC report found that over half of new mothers struggle to cope, 57% felt&#xa0;isolated and two in five admitted to&#xa0;getting angry. Other research suggests&#xa0;it&#xa0;is often as women and men&#xa0;(they can suffer, too) become more&#xa0;confident about their ability to&#xa0;soothe and care for&#xa0;their child that postnatal depression begins to ease.</p> <p>A new mother has to come to terms with loss as well as gain \u2013 loss of her sense of self and identity, with no choice now but to put the needs of her child before her own; loss of freedom and a great deal of her former life; loss of her more youthful, childless body; loss of control, income or the ability to earn for&#xa0;herself; and perhaps even the loss of&#xa0;friends who are childless and consequently find it hard to understand where her priorities now lie.</p> <p>Depression is a form of stasis as we adapt to radical change and accept loss. \"Depression is about anger, it is about anxiety, it is about character and heredity,\" writes Tim Lott in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/29/scent-dried-roses-tim-lott\" title=\"\">The Scent of Dried Roses</a>. \"It is the illness of identity, it is the illness of those who do not know where they fit, who lose faith in the myths they have painstakingly created for themselves.\"</p> <p>There are many ways in which accepting that sense of loss and adapting&#xa0;to motherhood has been made&#xa0;harder for women by cultural and&#xa0;social change. Childbirth may be natural, but that doesn't usually mean it is easy. In fact, bats probably have an easier time giving birth hanging upside down and then catching their young with their tails to stop them from splattering on to the ground below. When a new mother fails to have the intervention-free labour she planned for, or needs a caesarean section, too many feel as if they have failed before they have even begun on the remarkable journey of motherhood. Countless women, not so very long ago \u2013 just like Sybil in Downton Abbey \u2013 would have welcomed a c-section as a safer option if it&#xa0;would save their life and that of their child. So, too, would women throughout the third world, where childbirth is still a&#xa0;leading cause of death.</p> <p>Just 100 years ago, new mothers weren't as isolated within the western nuclear family as they are today. Most upper-middle-class households had nursery maids and nannies. Poorer women were&#xa0;more likely to be dependent on a&#xa0;network of extended family and&#xa0;neighbours close by for support, and someone to just hold the baby.</p> <p>Less was expected of a \"good\" mother, too. Children passed through people's lives, given and taken away by&#xa0;god. Now that we \"choose\" to have children, and know so much more about what the young need in terms of love, developmental stimulation and constant care, \"good\" mothers are expected to&#xa0;do&#xa0;and give so much more, which inevitably contributes to feelings of failure and inadequacy. Take the pressure to breastfeed \u2013 because breast is best, of&#xa0;course. Felicia Boots stopped her medication because she was worried it might damage her baby. So why did she not bottle-feed? Perhaps because that would have meant she was somehow failing her child. I will never forget the words of one new mother I interviewed for my book, Life After Birth, who said that she&#xa0;could never be friends with another mother who bottle-fed her baby.&#xa0;But what if that woman couldn't breastfeed for some reason? We forget how many babies died in the past because of an absence of nourishing and&#xa0;hygienic alternatives.</p> <p>Guilt over working as a mother has mushroomed in recent decades, too, as women struggle to do both jobs well. Women have education, ambitions and a great deal to offer, and yet all too often it feels as if their own sense of sanity or the apparent welfare of their child has to suffer because of our appalling record as a nation when it comes to supporting working parents with a better work-life balance, flexible working and affordable, quality childcare. <a href=\"http://www.mintel.com/press-centre/press-releases/960/12-million-mums-stay-at-home-due-to-high-childcare-costs\" title=\"\">Recent research by Mintel</a> found that six out of 10 stay-at-home mothers do not return to work because of the childcare costs. For rising numbers of low- to middle-income families (earning between \u00a317,000 and \u00a342,000), there is now little to be gained financially by having a \"second earner\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/27/soaring-cost-childcare-parents-work\" title=\"\">according to a major study</a>, Counting the&#xa0;Costs of Childcare, published by the Resolution Foundation last week \u2013 because of high childcare costs combined with the&#xa0;withdrawal of state&#xa0;support in tax credits. What does&#xa0;that do for the sanity of the mother&#xa0;who wants to work?</p> <p>The pressure to be perfect, and to be&#xa0;seen to be perfect, is monumental. We have to be in control of our lives. Individualism matters more now, too, which means there is a sharper contrast between the more self-interested life of&#xa0;a woman pre-childbirth and the inevitable sacrifices of \"good\" motherhood. We have to be capable and&#xa0;achieve. But so many aspects of motherhood require us to give in to the&#xa0;reality that much is beyond our control, and that achievements come in&#xa0;tiny, incremental steps which are hard&#xa0;to measure.</p> <p>We still do not know what causes postnatal depression. Some women simply struggle on, feeling under par. Others find it completely debilitating. When Lady Tebbit <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/ed8010b4\" title=\"\">appeared on Desert&#xa0;Island Discs</a>, she said her experience of postnatal depression was&#xa0;far harder to live with than the injuries she sustained when the IRA blew up the hotel she was&#xa0;staying in in Brighton during the 1984 Conservative party conference.</p> <p>Judge Fulford's sympathy for Felicia&#xa0;Boots and the tragedy that unfolded will&#xa0;I hope contribute to greater understanding of her condition. But her dreadful story is just the tip&#xa0;of an iceberg. Postnatal depression is not an illness that afflicts only a small group of unfortunate women at the very end of the spectrum, who already have mental health problems and cannot cope: every&#xa0;woman is vulnerable, whether this is their first, second or fifth baby. And children are then vulnerable, too, for a depressed mother is less likely to be able to respond quickly and effectively to her child's needs.</p> <p>With greater honesty about the difficulties countless new mothers face in adapting, and greater support for women during that crucial first year, the experience could be happier and more joyful. There is nothing shameful about saying that new motherhood is hard. Being a \"good enough\" parent is one of the hardest things we ever have to do.</p> <p><em>Kate Figes is the author of Life After Birth, published by Virago at \u00a39.99. </em></p>"
