  "<p>In its <a href=\"http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/150517/Scotland-elections-report-May-2012.pdf\">long-awaited report</a> (pdf) into May's Scottish council elections, the Electoral Commission has a fistful of recommendations to improve their conduct and performance, some technical and procedural but others more intriguing. </p> <p>It notes, for instance, that unlike in general elections the law does not limit what national parties can spend in local councils campaigns, how they spent it or who can legally donate. It wants that tidied up, smartish.</p> <p>And it also flags up one issue which may help boost turnout, up from the record low of 39.8% in May. It reveals that a large majority of Scottish councils now ban parties from erecting candidate placards and party posters on lamp-posts and street signs \u2013 it believes only 11 out of 32 allow it. </p> <p>So in large parts of Scotland \u2013 including <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/may/04/labour-frustrates-snp-scotland-gains\">major cities such as Glasgow</a>, where turnout in May hit a dangerously low 32.42% - many residents may be wholly unaware there is an election on; yet in North and South Lanarkshire, Highlands, East Renfrewshire, Shetland, Orkney or the Western Isles, lamp-posts are festooned with colour. </p> <p>On many streets in these areas there will be the fluorescent clamour of competing promises and imprecations to vote. In these areas, at least, elections are difficult to miss.</p> <p>Already sympathetic to critics of the ban, <a href=\"http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/scotland\">the commission</a> has had complaints from candidates. It urges councils, the national Electoral Management Board (EMB) and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla), to reassess their policies: </p> <blockquote> <p>In our report on the 2003 Scottish elections, we noted that not all councils allowed election posters to be placed on lampposts. We commented that allowing posters to be displayed helped to create the backdrop of the election and highlighted awareness of the event taking place. </p> <p>Since 2007, a further third of councils have prohibited this practice so that only 11 councils still allow candidates to put posters on lampposts. We believe that the issue of use of street furniture for political party posters near the date of an election should be reviewed as it may encourage participation at elections. We will seek discussion in Scotland on this matter with councils, Cosla, the parties and the EMB.</p> </blockquote> <p>There is no clear consensus on this: complaints about the ban seem based on instinct and rough logic, not clear evidence. No-one has tested this with voters. Even so, the commission's survey on public responses found that more than 40% of Scotland's voters knew little or nothing about the election:</p> <blockquote> <p>Of people surveyed in Scotland, 56% said they knew what the local elections were about, with 12% saying they knew 'a great deal' and 45% saying 'a fair amount'. However, 31% said they knew 'not very much' and 12% said they knew 'nothing at all'.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Even though complaints appear to come from candidates, it is the parties who have decided to ban using lamp-posts in all 21 local authorities where street posters are banned. And not, according to Glasgow council's press office, solely on cost grounds but on aesthetic ones too. </p> <blockquote> <p>The council's executive committee agreed to prohibit the use of council property to display election materials back in 2009 \u2013 and this included traffic signs, lights and other street furniture.</p> <p>The move had cross-party support, with members supporting the change arguing it was no longer acceptable for political parties to be allowed to carry out what would otherwise by considered fly posting. They also suggested the nature of campaigning had changed \u2013 with technology offering more cost-effective and environmentally-friendly ways to promote party messages.</p> </blockquote> <p>This disregards the fact that Glasgow has one of the UK's lowest rates of take-up for broadband. But Fife council too, where turnout hit a healthier 37.92% in May, reports that its very long-standing ban has cross-party support. Linda Bissell, a senior manager in its democratic services division, said:</p> <blockquote> <p>We have had a long-standing policy of not allowing election posters on street furniture during past election campaigns and have had no representations from candidates or political parties to change our position. However we welcome any future discussions on the issue with other councils and Cosla.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Willie Sullivan, Scottish director of the <a href=\"http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/scotland/\">Electoral Reform Society</a>, has a more jaundiced theory. He reckons the impact of street placards on voters is probably minor. He remembers putting up street placards himself, and reckons the distaste within parties for putting them up may be due more to the hassle of taking them down:</p> <blockquote> <p>There's a perennial problem with them just getting left up because all the volunteers have gone home, especially if they've lost the election. They can't be bothered any more.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sullivan thinks the problem with voter turnout needs more fundamental reforms: perhaps voting on Saturday's, or overturning the prohibition on campaigning on polling day, to instead turn polling day into a \"festival of democracy, so encouraging people to celebrate exercising their democratic right\". </p> <p>Some supporters of putting placards up would argue that a good festival needs plenty of bunting and bright posters out on the streets; Edinburgh city council - despite banning election posters - still happily manages to swathe the entire city centre in festival Fringe posters every August. </p> <p>And equally, the issue about election posters applies to every election, including UK general elections, Scottish parliamentary elections and the European ones too. Yet do they too suffer too? Not as much, it seems. For the Westminster and Holyrood polls, turnout is at least 20% greater than it was in May. Perhaps the goal is not just increasing turnout: maybe having busy and colourful streets just makes voting more fun, even for the country's councils.</p>",
  "<p>Divorce laws in England and Wales are so \"incomplete and uninformative\" that judges receive no guidance about the fairest way to divide a couple's property, the Law Commission has said.</p> <p>Judges get no proper guidance on whether to divide a couple's assets equally or according to each partner's needs, and there are no proper rules on how to divide belongings accumulated before the marriage began, the organisation cautions.</p> <p>There is also no legal definition of what constitutes the financial needs of a spouse or clarity about the extent to which divorcees must carry on supporting one another.</p> <p>Highlighting fundamental flaws at the heart of the family courts system, the Law Commission is launching a consultation on Tuesday on the reforms necessary to improve outdated regulations.</p> <p>The divorce laws have not changed since their liberalisation in 1969 despite a succession of landmark cases and the advent of pre-nuptial agreements.</p> <p>\"When two people bring their marriage or civil partnership to an end it is vital that the law is able to help them resolve their financial arrangements as quickly and fairly as possible,\" said Professor Elizabeth Cooke, the law commissioner leading the review. \"The current law creates too much potential for uncertainty and inconsistency.\"</p> <p>The consultation paper is highly critical of the deficiencies of the current legal framework. \"There are detailed statutory provisions about the orders that the court can make in these circumstances,\" it states, \"but the statute does not say what the court is to achieve by making these orders.</p> <p>\"The judge in the family court has been compared to a bus driver, who has been told how to drive the bus and told that he must drive it, but has not been told where to go, nor why he is to go there.</p> <p>\"Couples who do not go to court have to make their own financial arrangements by agreement. In doing so they need to know what their rights and obligations are, and the fact that the law is incomplete and uninformative does not help them.\"</p> <p>As well as considering needs, the consultation will look at the law governing the allocation of \"non-matrimonial property\" \u2013 the possessions a couple bring to their marriage or inherit rather than acquire together in the course of the partnership.</p> <p>Current rules are unclear but generally state that once needs have been met, such non-matrimonial property \"is less likely than other property to be shared on divorce or dissolution\".</p> <p>Three possible objectives for the courts to consider in divorce are set out in the consultation paper. The first option would be to compensate the needs of the less well-off spouse, so that he or she can attain the living standard they would have achieved but for childcare and other marital choices.</p> <p>Alternatively, the courts could consider providing support \"to enable a transition to independence\" that equalises the living standards of the couple for a lengthy period.</p> <p>The third possibility, the commission suggests, is \"to create incentives for independence\" rather than \"encouraging dependency\" on ex-partners. Artificial time limits for support might help but the commission says it is not attracted to Scotland's system of placing a three-year limit on support following divorce.</p> <p>The commission is due to publish recommendations for reform based on the consultation next autumn. It will include an earlier consultation on the enforceability of prenuptial agreements and form the basis for a draft bill to be introduced to parliament.</p> <p>Law firms expect the number of prenuptial agreements to rise sharply. Their legal status was bolstered by the supreme court's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2010/oct/20/banker-fails-challenge-prenup-heiress\" title=\"\">ruling in favour of the German heiress Katrin Radmacher</a> in October 2010.</p> <p>Andrew Newbury, head of the Pannone legal firm's family, private client and wealth management division, said: \"Prior to 2000, the main logic behind divorce settlements in England and Wales was meeting the needs of the financially weaker spouse. That changed with a ruling in the case of Martin and Pamela White, which introduced the idea of an equal share based on someone's contribution to the success of a marriage.</p> <p>\"In recent years, a great many multimillion [pound] settlements have been based on the same rationale, arguably along with the reputation of our courts as being 'wife-friendly'.</p> <p>\"The Radmacher ruling effectively said that individuals should be held to a properly drafted prenup, as long as it met their needs and they had signed of their own volition, even if the division of assets seemed unfair.</p> <p>\"If the Law Commission proposes that the government enshrines that position in law, it will only fuel what we have seen in the last 18 months or so \u2013 an increase in the number of prenups being taken out by those seeking to protect their wealth and those embarking on second marriages.\"</p> <p>Pannone says it has seen a fourfold rise in clients taking out prenuptial agreements since the Radmacher ruling.</p>",
  "<p>Never underestimate the need for a public wrong to be publicly righted. Throughout <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/granada/update/2012-09-10/hillsborough-the-search-for-truth/\" title=\"\"><strong>Hillsborough \u2013 The Search for the Truth</strong></a> (ITV1) I was waiting to learn something <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/09/hillsborough-families-day-reckoning?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+theguardian%2Ffootball%2Frss+%28Football%29\" title=\"\">I didn't already know about the disaster</a> at the FA Cup semi-final in 1989 that left 96 Liverpool fans dead. I'm still waiting. It took less than a year for the Taylor report to conclude in 1990 that the main cause of the tragedy had been the failure of the police to keep control of the crowd \u2013 most significantly by the order to open the exit gates before the game to relieve the pressure outside the ground, which prompted a surge of fans heading down the tunnel into the two central pens behind the goal.</p> <p>I knew all about the inquest in 1991 in which the coroner, Dr Stefan Popper, had decided that no one could possibly have been revived after 3.15pm and no later evidence would be admissible. I remember being amazed by this as there was already clear evidence from several witnesses including a police officer that one fan, Kevin Williams, had been alive at 3.50pm. I also remember thinking that the verdicts of accidental death were a complete fudge. And I've never stopped thinking that Michael Howard oozes slipperiness, even when he's turning up on a documentary trying to&#xa0;be conciliatory.</p> <p>Hillsborough survivors and relatives of the dead have always believed there has been a coverup. There hasn't. They know what really happened, the police know what really happened, the ambulance service knows what really happened and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 everyone who cares knows what really happened. The truth has been in the public domain for the past two decades for anyone who could be bothered to look for it. So how come it is so hard for anyone in authority to say we got it wrong at the time and we need another inquest? The <a href=\"http://panel.hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Hillsborough Independent Panel</a> publishes its findings: no doubt we'll get more details of&#xa0;the tragedy but I doubt we'll learn anything radically new. It isn't the truth that the Hillsborough victims need; it's justice.</p> <p>The police and the ambulance service acquitted themselves rather better in <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/999-whats-your-emergency\" title=\"\"><strong>999: What's Your Emergency</strong></a> (Channel 4), which came heavily trailed as the first series to follow incidents through from the time a member of the public picked up the phone to the arrival of the emergency services. We were also told that along the way that \"we would discover how Britain is changing\". It's hard to say it lived up to its billing in the first episode which was almost entirely devoted to the party-goers who descend on Blackpool to take drugs, drink too much, get lairy and fall over. I'd reckon this is a Britain that almost everyone could recognise only too easily; I may be jaded but I don't need reminding that spending any time with people who are off their faces is not time well spent.</p> <p>There are 31m 999 calls a year, so the point of the programme must have&#xa0;been to remind us that at least 95% of them are not so much emergencies as society's filter for hoovering up the mad, sad and the bad, but it quickly felt terribly repetitive in a way that <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/24-hours-in-ae\" title=\"\">24 Hours in A&amp;E</a> never did. I'd imagine that in future episodes we will get to see the emergency services in rather more varied and demanding situations where there's something rather more at stake: if not, then I've had enough already.</p> <p>The programme of the night with the most surprises turned out to be <a href=\"http://www.itvmedia.co.uk/leaving-drama\" title=\"\"><strong>Leaving</strong></a> (ITV1). Who would have thought ITV could do a drama about a love affair between an older woman and a younger man without a hint of prurience or loud signals that it was dealing with a taboo issue? Instead, Leaving was touching, understated and entirely believable with Helen McCrory and Callum Turner in the lead roles of Julie and Aaron. As it was also written by Tony Marchant \u2013 a man not noted for giving his characters an easy ride \u2013 it's a fair bet that things are likely to go very badly wrong in the two remaining episodes and that one or both are going to wind up badly hurt. Still, it looked fun while it lasted.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 September 2012. The original said never overestimate the need for a public wrong to be publicly righted. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Celebratory gunfire erupted in Mogadishu on Monday night after Hassan Sheikh Mohamud defeated incumbent Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed to become Somalia's new president.</p> <p>It is the first time since the 1991 overthrow of president Said Barre that a new leader has been chosen inside the country, a development hailed by the UN as a sign of improving security. But the process has been tainted by allegations of bribery and corruption.</p> <p>MPs marked their ballot papers behind a curtain before casting them in a clear box in front of foreign envoys and hundreds of Somali men and women. In a surprise result, Mohamud won a runoff by 190 votes to 79 after the first round failed to produce a clear winner.</p> <p>Mohamud, 57, is a professor and activist who has worked for several national and international peace and development organisations including the UN children's agency Unicef. Last year, frustrated by Somalia's dominant clan system, he founded what he claimed was the first political party in Mogadishu, the Peace and Development party.</p> <p>Touching a Qur'an with his right hand, Mohamud was sworn in as president within minutes of his poll victory. Ahmed, the outgoing president, conceded defeat after the onlookers in the hall spontaneously stood up and sang the national anthem.</p> <p>\"I am happy to see the first free and fair election happen in Somalia after 40 years,\" he said. \"I want to congratulate the new president for the fair election, and I want to declare that I am fully satisfied with the results.\"</p> <p>Outgoing prime minister Abdiweli Mohamed Ali, who threw his weight behind Mohamud's candidacy, said the result heralded a new era for Somali politics. \"Somalia voted for change,\" he told Reuters, adding it was too early to say if he would take part in the new administration.</p> <p>Among the countless issues in the new president's intray will be piracy off the Somali coast, which has led to millions of pounds worth of armed defences for international shipping. In an interview with the Guardian at his office in Mogadishu last month, Mohamud accused foreign powers of hypocrisy.</p> <p>\"Somalis are confused,\" he said. \"The international community is putting a lot of resources towards it. Why not address the illegal fishing in Somali seas? People are getting the notion that international forces are there to protect the illegal fishing. The Somali fisherman cannot go to the sea because he will be considered a pirate.\"</p> <p>Referring to allegations that European firms dump toxic waste off the Somali coast, he added: \"Why the international community not say anything? It's delicate.\"</p> <p>But Mohamud rejected the idea of offering pirates an amnesty. \"That will only encourage more. They have to be given some incentive but not that. Give them skills and rehabilitation and the opportunity to learn a better life.</p> <p>Although Islamist militant group al-Shabaab has been driven out of Mogadishu, assassinations and suicide bombings remain a constant threat. As president, Mohamud will now be a prime target. He admitted: \"Anybody who lives here in Mogadishu always lives under enormous risk. We have a coping mechanism but it doesn't always work.</p> <p>\"The fear factor is very strong. It makes the people quiet, it makes people behave differently. If we let the fear factor control us, we will never move ahead.\"</p> <p>Mohamud has received threats from al-Shabaab in the past. \"Someone called my wife to say, 'You'll have to take care of your orphan soon.' Al-Shabaab targets everybody who is doing something against them\u2013 a woman in civil society, a traditional elder, a businessman, a religious leader.</p> <p>\"Al-Shabaab is not an ordinary militia like a clan militia. It is an ideology. You cannot fight an ideology only. That is what the government is doing. Military al-Shabaab is defeated; the areas they control are because nobody wants them, but still the ideology is there. We need a multi-faceted war against them. If we continue like this, the suicide bombings will continue.\"</p> <p>Continued peace in Mogadishu is far from assured, he said. \"If Amisom [African Union forces] left the state house, the president will not be there. Somalia doesn't have 100 trained soldiers capable of defending it. They are killing machines, trained in militia camps. They do not see themselves as servants of the people.</p> <p>\"If you go through Mogadishu, you can see it is different from 18 months ago. But the question is, how sustainable is this? It's still very fragile. Amisom cannot be here forever. We Somalis need to have our own security forces.\"</p> <p>During the interview, Mohamud presented himself as a political outsider untainted by the UN-backed transitional federal government (TFG) and its \"failure of leadership\". In July, a UN report said it had found that out of every $10 in revenue raised between 2009-10, $7 had never made it into state coffers.</p> <p>Graft had become endemic, Mohamud said. \"The leaders see the state as a money-making machine. They don't want to confine their power. Corruption was an important factor that contributed and still does today.\"</p> <p>He said the selection of MPs was flawed but his party had backed the process and a new constitution. Little guessing that he would emerge the victor, he added: \"It is a defining time in Somalia. I'm not saying Somalia will get what it deserves but it will be better than the status quo.\"</p> <p>Mohamud graduated from the Somali National University in 1981 and went on to study in India, where he obtained a master's degree from Bhopal University in 1988. He returned home and taught as a professor, including at the Somali Institute of Management and Administration Development, which he helped found in 1999. Its goal is to train administrators and technicians who can help rebuild the country.</p> <p>The vote was seen as a culmination of a regionally brokered and UN-backed roadmap. There has been no effective central government control over most of the largely lawless country since the outbreak of civil war in 1991.</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 It's soul-destroying to be part of that which you despise, so spare a thought for Ukipians in the European parliament. They get elected the better to expose the iniquities, but it's stressful. No wonder they don't turn up very often. According to the independent transparency watchdog <a href=\"http://www.votewatch.eu/\" title=\"\">Votewatch</a>, Ukip has the worst attendance, voting and work performance of any British party in the European parliament, and among the worst in the entire EU. Indeed, the two most senior Ukip MEPs, the leader Nigel Farage and chair Paul Nuttall, are said to offer among the worst value for money of all 753 MEPs. \"A few of their members knuckle down but too many of the rest pocket the money and skive off when there is work to do,\" claims Lib Dem <a href=\"http://chrisdaviesmep.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Chris Davies</a>.

Another diary exclusive.</p> <p>\u2022 To Oxfordshire, meanwhile, where at least one of the Murdoch clan can now rest safely. Liz, the \"liberal\" Murdoch, and her husband, spinmeister Matthew Freud<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/nov/17/hugh-muir-diary-matthew-freud-murdoch\" title=\"\">, have finally been given permission to build a battlement</a> for their multimillion-pound house, Burford Priory. A hefty project too \u2013 a house with a fulltime security guard. West Oxfordshire district council last week granted permission. It seems a member of the hoi polloi nicked an expensive lawnmower from the priory and the Murdoch-Freuds worried about further incursions. They were right to fret, for Britain is still broken. We don't hear so much about it, though, since Dave reached No 10.</p> <p>\u2022 Shadows fall around Sir Andrew Likierman, he of the Barclays Bank audit committee and personification, some say, of the failure of corporate governance. His resignation is generally expected, but if he goes his other position as chair of the National Audit Office \u2013 ultimate custodian of public spending \u2013 also looks untenable. His lingering presence there is already a source of embarrassment. Underlings mutter, but what can they do apart from wait it out? Bob Diamond has gone, but the man who was among those minding the store stays put.</p> <p>\u2022 To the US, and here's a gift for Barack Obama. If he really wants to hurt Mitt Romney, why not just flag up the Republican's dastardly link with the French? Paris Match has a spread on Romney's Frenchiness; he spent a good part of his 1960s youth in the rural south-west. Mainly it rehashes details of a 1968 car crash from which Mitt, the driver, escaped. His boss's wife died. But it also spotlights the fact that Mitt, his wife and the kids are all fluent in French. \"In private, he often evokes his memories of being in France,\" says his brother-in-law unhelpfully. <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/01/12/gingrich-hits-romney-for-speaking-french/\" title=\"\">Newt Gingrich flagged this up</a>, but with the renewed spotlight, shouldn't this be the end of him?

Shouldn't the same rules apply to Mitt?</p> <p>\u2022 Finally, the Olympic goodwill just couldn't last.

  "<p>The Thick Of It creator Armando Iannucci has called on the BBC to fight back against its critics in parliament and the press.</p> <p>Iannucci, whose acclaimed Westminster satire returned to BBC2 last Saturday night, said British television felt \"disarmed and confused\" because of \"consistent cack-handed interference by politicians goaded by the press\".</p> <p>He said \"supine\" television executives had failed to fight back \u2013 not just at the BBC but across broadcasting \u2013 and said \"now is the time to fight back\".</p> <p>Delivering the annual Bafta Lecture in London's Piccadilly, entitled \"Fight, fight, fight\", Iannucci railed against politicians and press barons trying to influence what we see on the small screen.</p> <p>\"Governments whether right or left have become commissioners in chief, nudging and cajoling networks into preferred business models without the slightest sensitivity or awareness of what the public wants or the TV industry is capable of,\" said Iannucci.</p> <p>He said politicians saw television as something to be \"badgered or bullied\" and the BBC as an easy target.</p> <p>But he said the Leveson inquiry into press ethics had highlighted public misgivings about the way the press and politicians operated and said viewers would \"never forgive anyone who meddles with British television for their own advantage\".</p> <p>With George Entwistle, the new director general of the BBC due to take up his post on Monday next week, Iannucci said there \"could not be a better time to reset the board\".</p> <p>He said he wanted all UK broadcasters but especially the BBC to be more gung-ho about promoting themselves overseas.</p> <p>\"I want to encourage us to be more aggressive in promoting what makes British TV so good. Be ambitious, arrogant even, in how we sell it to the world.</p> <p>\"The BBC brand is up there with Apple and Google, I want it to go abroad and prostitute itself to blue buggery in how it sells and makes money from its content.\"</p> <p>He added: \"It goes back to the old amateur spirit of the Olympics, that it's wrong to make money. There is still an element of the BBC that feels it is somehow wrong, or it will be open to criticism if it makes more money.\"</p> <p>In a question and answer session after his lecture, Iannucci said the BBC had to stop being scared of negative headlines in the Daily Mail.</p> <p>\"The great unspoken support of the BBC is the viewing public and the BBC seems to forget that but is continually aware of bad headlines in the Daily Mail. It's a strange dynamic. What's wrong with having criticism in the press?\"</p> <p>Iannucci, who once said the BBC should tell James Murdoch to \"fuck off\", said the Murdochs were \"just not as frightening anymore\" in the wake of the Leveson inquiry into press ethics and the phone-hacking scandal.</p> <p>He criticised the BBC's licence fee settlement two years ago which saw the level of the fee frozen but the corporation take on extra funding responsibilities including the BBC World Service.</p> <p>\"That was a back of the envelope last minute decision which had nothing to do with public spending. It was a loaded gun,\" he said.</p> <p>Iannucci said David Cameron's description of the six-year funding freeze as \"delicious\" showed that the Conservatives still had a BBC agenda. He said the traditional Conservative party still saw the corporation as a radical hotbed which was \"determined to bring anarchy to the UK when in fact it put on the Olympics brilliantly\".</p> <p>But Iannucci warned that the changing way in which we watch television meant it was going to be very difficult to justify the licence fee in 10 years' time.</p> <p>He said British television was once the \"most adored, copied and influential in the world\" but it had lost that crown over the last five or 10 years to the US and shows such as The Sopranos, The Wire and Breaking Bad.</p> <p>He used his lecture to call on commissioning executives to give creatives more freedom, and for Sky, which has pledged to double the amount it invests in UK comedy and drama, to invest some of that money in new talent.</p> <p>He said the Olympics opening ceremony was an example of what can happen when creatives are given the freedom to express themselves. When decisions were taken by committee, he said, you end up with the Millennium Dome.</p> <p>Iannucci admitted the title of his lecture was \"rather aggressive\" and joked he had originally thought of calling it \"make good programmes\".</p> <p>\"Never underestimate the intelligence of the audience, make good programmes and they will come,\" he added.</p>",
  "<p>New York officials were locked in negotiations Monday in a last-ditch attempt to break the deadlock that has delayed the building of the ground zero memorial museum ahead of the 11th anniversary of 9/11.</p> <p>Parties to the talks were hopeful that a deal could yet be done ahead of Tuesday's anniversary ceremony in order to avoid yet another embarrassing chapter in the rebuilding of ground zero.</p> <p>The current dispute between funding parties has pushed back the opening of the museum, which is conceived as the memorial heart of the 16-acre site, until 2014 \u2013 fully five years after it was initially meant to be completed.</p> <p>Family members of some of the victims of the 9/11 attacks, who have been involved in designing the museum, said they were reaching the end of their patience.

If a deal isn't reached many of us will be speaking out about it,\" said Christine Ferer, a board member who lost her husband, Neil Levin, on 9/11.</p> <p>Ferer, whose husband was the executive director of the port authority of New York and New Jersey, said that the current dispute paradoxically arose from an attempt by politicians on the port authority to wrest control of the museum away from the September 11 foundation. \"The foundation is a private body that raised $450m to build the museum \u2013 it is not appropriate for government bodies to try and control it.\"</p> <p>The disagreement has led to work on the memorial museum to be suspended for the past nine months. It has also pitted some of the most powerful political figures in the US north-east against each other.</p> <p>On one side are Andrew Cuomo and Chris Christie, the governors of New York state and New Jersey respectively, who control the port authority that has been designated the job of building the museum. Up against them is Michael Bloomberg, mayor of New York, who sits as chair of the foundation and who has contributed $15m of his own money to the project.</p> <p>The governors have been expressing their disgruntlement over how much the museum is costing. Originally estimated at $700m, it has almost doubled in cost to $1.3bn; the port authority and the foundation are wrangling over how much each should pay of the capital costs as well as the estimated $60 million annual running costs.</p> <p>As a sign of the ill-feeling that is swirling around the memorial site, for the first time no politicians of any description will be invited to speak at the anniversary memorial service. In previous years the mayor and governors have read out some of the names of the fallen.</p> <p>The political squabble is a throwback to previous disagreements that have troubled the ground zero reconstruction for many of the past 11 years. The main replacement skyscraper, 1 World Trade Center, took years to get going as different private and government agencies tussled with each other over budgets and control before it finally took off over the past three years.</p> <p>The building has now reached its summit 104th floor with only the telecoms spire that will take it to 1,776 feet yet to be erected. It is expected to open for business in 2014.</p> <p>As talks over the museum continued on Monday, the first glimpse of how it might eventually look was revealed to victims' families. The building will consist of two main parts \u2013 an historical section that will explore the world before and after the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington, and a memorial portion that will remember the nearly 3,000 victims of the terrorist attacks in 2001 as well as the World Trade Center bombing on 26 February 1993.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395944069\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/10/1347309051971/September-11-museum-010.jpg\" alt=\"September 11 museum\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The museum will feature photographs of all 2,983 victims.

They were shown a prototype of touchscreen tables that will be present throughout the museum, carrying the photographs of all 2,983 victims. </p> <p>So far the memorial exhibition's organisers have tracked down images of all but 21 of the victims, in addition to gathering personal artefacts to be displayed in the building such as favourite items of clothing, wedding rings, pocket books and so on.</p> <p>Visitors will be able to touch the portraits of any of the victims to access their biographies, written or recorded tributes from friends and family, and a picture gallery of their life. One of the first of these multi-media profiles to be completed was that of Joseph Agnello, a 35-year-old firefighter from Queens who died in the Twin Towers.</p> <p>His profile contained audio recordings of his mother, Rita, and father, Salvatore, reminiscing about him.</p> <p>Similar biographies will be projected onto a large white wall and the exhibition will also include a small chamber where loved-ones will be able to sit and remember those who died in an more intimate setting.</p>",
  "<p>Is Nouri al-Maliki becoming Iraq's next dictator and, if he is, does anyone in Washington care? The second half of the question is easy to answer. The Pentagon wanted to keep 8,000 troops in Iraq after withdrawal. But Maliki made it clear there would be no US troops after the agreement expired on 31 December 2011. The state department also planned for an embassy up to 16,000 strong, and a CIA station 700 strong, but the Iraqi strongman made short shrift of a sizeable US civilian presence, by insisting that his office take direct responsibility for approving every US diplomatic visa. Washington could use the soft power of military supply contracts, but is unwilling to do that. Maliki is allowing Iranian overflights to resupply Assad's embattled regime in Syria. Washington still does not want to know.</p> <p>As to the first part of the question, Maliki's authoritarianism has some way to go before it reaches the proportions of Saddam Hussein's terror. But the charge sheet is growing: the night of the US withdrawal, troops and tanks led by Maliki's son surrounded the houses of his vice-president Tariq al-Hashemi and two other members of the Sunni-dominated Iraqiyya coalition. On Sunday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/10/iraqi-vice-president-attacks-verdict\" title=\"\">Hashemi was sentenced to death in absentia</a>, for masterminding death squads against rivals. Confessions were tortured out of three of his bodyguards, one of whom died from his injuries. Iraqiyya, which won the most seats at the last election in 2010, is not the first victim of Maliki's power grab.</p> <p>As Toby Dodge, a leading Iraqi scholar, has <a href=\"http://www.iiss.org/publications/survival/survival-2012/year-2012-issue-3/iraqs-road-back-to-dictatorship/\" title=\"\">chronicled</a>, Maliki gained complete control over Iraq's security forces, subverting the formal chain of command, moving the office of commander-in-chief into his office, and creating provincial command centres, commanded by generals who were handpicked by him. Under him, the Iraq special operations forces, described as the best in the Middle East, became a praetorian guard, dubbed \"Fedayeen al-Maliki\". The same goes for the intelligence services and the judiciary. Having seen off those Sunnis who downed their arms and tried politics in 2010, Maliki's next target will be the Kurds, whose autonomy he will threaten, and then the Sadrists. The end product will be a centralised state not unlike Vladimir Putin's Russia. Like Putin, Maliki practises a form of competitive authoritarianism. This employs the toolkit of a democratic state (a parliament, set elections, a constitution) for a purpose that is anything but \u2013 the maintenance of power at all costs, torture and death squads included.</p> <p>It should therefore come as no surprise that al-Qaida, which was decimated when Sunni tribal chiefs turned against it, is back in business. Maliki's quest for domination could drive his country back into civil war.</p>",
  "<p>Iain Duncan Smith's flagship welfare reform programme, under which most benefits will be rolled into one universal credit, is heading for a disaster, according to the government's poverty tsar, Frank Field.</p> <p>As MPs prepare to vote on the reforms in the Commons on Tuesday, Field says the universal credit is \"practically unachievable\" and will \"rot the soul\" of low-paid workers by encouraging dependency.</p> <p>Field, a Labour MP and former welfare reform minister, has previously been well disposed towards some Tory welfare reforms. In an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/10/universal-credit-benefits-disaster\" title=\"\">article for the Guardian</a>, he writes that Duncan Smith was brave to resist David Cameron's attempt to move him to the Ministry of Justice in last week's cabinet reshuffle.</p> <p>But Field writes: \"It was the prime minister's wish to avert a catastrophe that drove him to try to move his work and pensions secretary so that the government could quietly shut down the whole reform. His failure to act leaves the disaster on course.\"</p> <p>Cameron tried to move Duncan Smith from the Department for Work and Pensions amid fears in the Treasury that the costs of the universal credit, due to be introduced in stages between next April and 2017, are spiralling out of control.</p> <p>The new system is designed to simplify benefits and increase incentives to work. Under the current system, claimants can lose 90p of every extra \u00a31 they earn as their benefits are tapered off. Under the universal credit this will fall to 65p in every \u00a31.</p> <p>On Monday in the Commons, Duncan Smith pledged to press ahead with the universal credit, though he did offer a concession in one area highlighted by Field and other critics. He said he would consider making payments to the lowest-paid on a fortnightly basis, as happens at present, rather than monthly as planned.</p> <p>Field dismisses the entire reform and rejects one of Duncan Smith's central arguments: that the universal credit will mark a step away from means testing. He writes: \"Means testing only encourages dependency, and the universal credit is, in one sense, the ultimate form of means testing.</p> <p>\"It obviously gets extra money to hard-working families who earn low wages, but in doing so it rots the soul. Recipients have to be saints not to take the loss of credit payments into account when deciding whether to work longer or to train for a more highly paid job.\"</p> <p>He says he has asked the National Audit Office to carry out a special inquiry into the implementation of the universal credit, amid fears that the IT changes are too ambitious. Field writes: \"I am, therefore, against universal credit in principle, but I also fear that the programme is practically unachievable.\"</p> <p>Duncan Smith told MPs on Monday: \"Universal credit is on time, on budget and I particularly want to stay here to see that through.\"</p>",
  "<p>Acupuncture could be a useful treatment in some cases of chronic pain, according to a study that pooled the results of 29 clinical trials on almost 18,000 people. But the overall benefits were small, compared with no acupuncture or sham acupuncture.</p> <p>The traditional Chinese treatment involves inserting needles into specific points in the body. Andrew J Vickers of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre in New York led a team of scientists who collated data from previously published, randomised controlled trials on 17,922 patients from the US, UK, Germany, Spain and Swedenwith back and neck pain, osteoarthritis, chronic headache and shoulder pain. \"We found acupuncture to be superior to both no-acupuncture control and sham acupuncture for the treatment of chronic pain,\" wrote Vickers in the September 10 edition of <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/archinternmed.2012.3654\" title=\"\">the Archives of Internal Medicine</a>. \"Although the data indicate that acupuncture is more than a placebo, the differences between true and sham acupuncture are relatively modest, suggesting that factors in addition to the specific effects of needling are important contributors to therapeutic effects.\"</p> <p>The sham treatments used in the studies included needles that had not been fully inserted or devices where the needle retracted into the handle rather than puncturing the skin. Other shams included electrical stimulation.</p> <p>Vickers found that patients receiving acupuncture had less pain with scores that were 0.23, 0.16 and 0.15 standard deviations lower than sham controls for back and neck pain, osteoarthritis and chronic headaches respectively. In comparison to controls, people who received acupuncture had pain that was 0.55, 0.57 and 0.42 standard deviations lower. The scientists concluded that acupuncture was, therefore, a \"reasonable referral option\" for patients with chronic pain.</p> <p>Edzard Ernst, emeritus professor of complementary medicine at the University of Exeter, said the study \"impressively and clearly\" showed that the effects of acupuncture were mostly due to placebo. \"The differences between the results obtained with real and sham acupuncture are small and not clinically relevant. Crucially, they are probably due to residual bias in these studies. Several investigations have shown that the verbal or non-verbal communication between the patient and the therapist is more important than the actual needling. If such factors would be accounted for, the effect of acupuncture on chronic pain might disappear completely.\"</p> <p>Ernst added that a potential problem with the trials in the meta-analysis was that, in all cases, the therapist knew whether he or she was administering real or sham acupuncture. \"Arguably, it is next to impossible to completely keep this information from the patient. In other words, a trial is either both patient and therapist-blind, or not blind at all. Acupuncturists tend to tell us that therapist blinding is impossible, but this is clearly not true. I fear that, once we manage to eliminate this bias from acupuncture studies, we might find that the effects of acupuncture exclusively are a placebo response.\"</p> <p>In an accompanying commentary article in the journal, Andrew Avins of the healthcare consortium <a href=\"https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/html/kaiser/index.shtml\" title=\"\">Kaiser-Permanente</a> based in Oakland, California, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/archinternmed.2012.4198\" title=\"\">wrote that</a> while it was ideal to understand the mechanism of action of an intervention, the ultimate question was if it worked for the patient.</p> <p>\"At least in the case of acupuncture, Vickers et al have provided some robust evidence that acupuncture seems to provide modest benefits over usual care for patients with diverse sources of chronic pain,\" wrote Avins. \"Perhaps a more productive strategy at this point would be to provide whatever benefits we can for our patients, while we continue to explore more carefully all mechanisms of healing.\"</p>",
  "<p>Interviewing Jin Xing is tiring enough: her emphatic but accelerated delivery fills pages of a notebook within minutes. Being her must be truly exhausting. Her starring role in a Shanghai play has come to a close, but there's a new contemporary dance production; a television talkshow to host; guest spots as a judge on a TV talent contest; and three young children to mother.</p> <p>That's just this autumn. She has crammed much more into her life, partly thanks to the fearsome military discipline forged as a colonel in the People's Liberation Army performance troupe. She may be the only acclaimed contemporary dancer capable of blowing up a bridge. Though she is just 43, Jin's life has spanned numerous roles, two continents and, most famously, both genders.</p> <p>\"All over the world, it's very tough for people to accept it,\" she says of her gender reassignment surgery.</p> <p>But in China, which remains in some ways highly conservative, her frankness is almost unique: \"Homosexuals are like a small island. Transgender [people] are a tiny island.\"</p> <p>This is not a complaint. For one thing, Jin does not believe in them. \"I&#xa0;hate whining. If you want to do it, do it. If you're doing it and complaining \u2013 what a pathetic life.\"</p> <p>For another, she believes that having had the surgery makes her \"more privileged, special and stronger, because I have a wider angle in looking at society and life\".</p> <p>Her career has earned her plaudits from Li Yinhe, a sociologist and one of the best-known advocates for LGBT rights in China, who says, \"She is still discriminated against by society, but she is very brave in facing it. She has a good family and successful career; her achievements have made her an icon.\"</p> <p>\"I chose the stage, then dance chose me,\" Jin says while whacking on makeup in her dressing room. As a young boy, Jin joined the entertainment troupe of the army. All the performers had to undertake the PLA's routine training and young Jin struggled with grenades and machine guns, too big and unwieldy for his slight hands and body. The dance classes were equally harsh, with instructors physically contorting the children's bodies until they were flexible enough. \"In western culture, you'd call it complete child abuse. In China, that's the culture: you want to be the best? You do it.\"</p> <p>Were they beaten? \"If you made a&#xa0;mistake? Of course!\"</p> <p>With only one visit home each year, homesickness added to the pressure. \"I'm still benefiting from the discipline of military training. I have a performance tonight but at 9am tomorrow I'll be back in the [dance] studio training again. Even the way I take my dance company \u2013 that's about discipline. Nobody breaks my rules,\" she adds. \"<em>Big</em> trouble.\" After saying this she flashes a lovely smile.</p> <p>She studied contemporary dance in New York. But the lessons outside the studio proved as important as those inside: \"If you ask what I am proud of \u2013 I am only proud that once I was 19, when the government sent me to the US, I took charge of my own life. Everything I do I choose \u2013 no matter how tough or whatever failure.\"</p> <p>It took her years to make the hardest choice. Even as a small boy, Jin knew that \"something was wrong. I so envied my sister. I felt I should be her.\"</p> <p>Unable to make sense of the feelings, he sublimated them for years. For a while after moving to New York, he thought he might be gay. Finally, that childhood sense reemerged, \"a weird feeling in myself \u2013 that I should be a&#xa0;woman\".</p> <p>To Jin's surprise, her conservative parents accepted her decision without question; her father had always felt there was something different about his child.</p> <p>But her life story has the mythic outlines of a movie (\"Pedro Alm\u00f3dovar is a good friend of mine. One day he will make a movie out of my life.\") There was, of course, a twist.</p> <p>She woke from her operation to discover that the nerves of one leg had been badly affected. Doctors warned she would walk with a limp.</p> <p>\"Oh. My. God. The first moment I realised my leg was damaged, I wanted to jump out of the building. I thought my life was finished,\" she says. \"But after three, four days, I thought well \u2013 this is another test.\" She was on stage within three months.</p> <p>Next came the adoption of three children. A few years later, she sat next to a German businessman on a flight from Shanghai to Paris. Heinz-Gerd Oidtmann rang her the next day; though he took a few days to digest the news that Jin had been a man, they&#xa0;soon became a couple. Oidtmann calls her a \"control freak\", she jokes; and she has struggled to adapt to his European mindset: \"I've tried to learn to take a holiday. After three days I feel guilty.\"</p> <p>As for the children, who are usually kept away from iPads, \"rubbish\" TV and junk food, \"They get very close to Daddy. When Mummy's travelling, he takes them to KFC \u2026\" She does not look too worried at the prospect. For all her talk of discipline, her eldest son, now aged 12, will soon head to boarding school in the UK because \"the Chinese education system sucks \u2026 The first thing kids learn is: obey.\"</p> <p>Few would wish to cross Jin. She called a fellow talkshow guest \u2013 a celebrity who criticised his wife for telling people he had hit her repeatedly \u2013 a \"filthy and selfish man\".</p> <p>She's a judge on the Chinese equivalent of Strictly Come Dancing, but is scathing: \"In the UK they really work at it. Over here it's second- or third-class movie stars who just want the exposure and work for a maximum of one week. It's really low-quality dancing.\" Now she has her own debate show, which airs on a Hong Kong station rather than the heavily censored mainland channels. But she picks her topics carefully: \"I'm not against the party [and] I know the laws \u2013 but I can talk about social issues.\" Officials trust her because \"they know I know the borderlines\", she says. Besides, what better way to demonstrate the changing face of China than via an outspoken transsexual former colonel?</p> <p><em>Additional research by Cecily Huang </em></p>",
  "<p>The Turkish ambassador's letter (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/04/cyprus-problem-not-invasion\" title=\"\">The Cyprus problem is not one of 'invasion'</a>, 5 September) by which he protests over the terminology used by your paper adds insult to injury. It is not the Guardian's style guide that needs amendment, as Ambassador \u00c7evik\u00f6z claims, but rather the unacceptable status quo in Cyprus that needs to be rectified by Ankara. No euphemism can change historical facts, nor the reality on the ground. Since its invasion in 1974, Turkey has been stationing more than 40,000 troops in Cyprus, occupying a third of its territory, in blatant disregard of repeated calls by the UN security council.</p> <p>Mr \u00c7evik\u00f6z conveniently recalls only the rejection of the Annan plan in 2004, without offering any explanation for the failures of all previous attempts to reach a settlement over a period of 30 years nor for the efforts since then. For Turkey, it is as if time in Cyprus has started and ended on that very year. Needless to recall that the Annan plan was rejected in a democratic referendum, in accordance with its own provisions. I would sincerely prefer to address issues related to ongoing efforts to reach a comprehensive settlement. I firmly believe that a forward-looking, less confrontational and international law-abiding policy on behalf of Turkey, is the only way to reach a solution, securing peace and prosperity for both Cypriot communities, as well as for the entire region. <br><strong>Alexandros N Zenon</strong> <br>Cyprus high commissioner</p> <p>\u2022 The way the Turkish ambassador flicks between speaking of Turks and Turkish Cypriots is highly selective. If the northern region of Cyprus is indeed a self-governing democracy representing Turkish Cypriots, perhaps the ambassador could explain the presence of roughly one Turkish soldier for every two Turkish Cypriots, as well as a large population of settlers from mainland Turkey? One can surely be forgiven for thinking of that northern portion of Cyprus as more of an Anatolian colony.<br><strong>Sotirios Hatjoullis </strong><br><em>London</em></p>",
  "<p>Slashing red tape including health and safety inspections for smaller companies is not a \"silver bullet\" for restoring economic growth, according to the organisation representing more than 100,000 British businesses.</p> <p>The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) called for a wider range of measures to kickstart the economy after the business secretary, Vince Cable, announced that hundreds of thousands of firms including shops and pubs would be exempted from health and safety inspections.</p> <p>\"Cutting back forms of red tape that do not serve the public interest is a very positive move for the business environment. However, it is not going to be the silver bullet that delivers growth,\" said Adam Marshall, director of policy at the BCC. \"It has to go alongside access to financing, improvements in infrastructure and making a skills system that works for companies.\"</p> <p>The Confederation of British Industry, another business lobby group, was more positive, saying deregulation would bring immediate benefits by freeing up time and money, allowing companies to concentrate on expanding.</p> <p>Guy Bailey, head of employment policy at the CBI, said: \"A growing number of regulations can stifle innovation and economic growth. Reducing the regulatory burden will benefit businesses and the economy.\"</p> <p>The announcement was met with alarm at the annual TUC conference in Brighton, however, where the Prospect union questioned the government's reference to 3,000 regulations when there were only 200 health and safety regulations in the UK.</p> <p>\"Where the government gets its figures from is anyone's guess,\" said Mike Clancy, general secretary designate of Prospect, which represents more than 1,600 staff at the Health and Safety Executive.</p> <p>Clancy added that companies had a \"commercial and moral\" imperative to have a strong health and safety culture: \"If you do not have coherent legislation, the alternative is that employers will develop business models where they take liberties with peoples' safety. You will not have good customer service and products in that environment.\"</p> <p>Two manufacturers contacted by the Guardian said industrial companies took health and safety issues seriously.</p> <p>Naylor Industries, a family-owned maker of drainage pipes based in Barnsley, said complying with health and safety regulations generated paperwork but was a necessity for the business.</p> <p>Edward Naylor, chief executive of the firm that employs 250 people, said: \"The last thing we want is a lack of focus on health and safety.</p> <p>\"It is one of those areas where there are a lot of documentary requirements but, on balance, we would say that it is in the best interests of the business.\"</p> <p>However, Naylor said there was a \"large amount\" of red tape attached to energy use and quarrying activity that was time-consuming, even if the company agreed in principle with environmental legislation. \"We would be happy if there was half the amount of red tape flying around.\" Naylor's chief operating officer, Bridie Warner-Adsetts, said a reduction in \"vexatious\" employment tribunal claims would also benefit businesses. \"It has been an unfair system,\" she said.</p> <p>Amtico, a Coventry-based maker of industrial flooring, said it supported existing rules.</p> <p>\"I am all for health and safety legislation because it makes sure that the workplace is safe,\" said Jonathan Duck, Amtico's chief executive, adding that health and safety \"takes primacy over everything\" at his company.</p> <p>Duck said his problem was not with red tape but with issues such as employment tax. \"The regulatory framework is fine. For me that's not where the issues lie,\" he said.</p> <p>He pointed to the starting rate of employment tax. \"It prevents you from hiring and makes your costs more expensive.\"</p> <p>Duck said a worker starting on \u00a38,000 a year would draw an employment tax rate, including income tax and national insurance, of 46%.</p> <p>\"We should be looking at some of the more fundamental things,\" said Duck, whose firm employs 600 people.</p>",
  "<p>Barely 10 weeks before voters from Cornwall to Cumbria are due to elect their first police and crime commissioners, Trish Branson is an unusually well-informed citizen. Most midweek passersby in Leicester's busy city centre can only offer a puzzled frown when asked what they know about the government's policing plan. But Branson knows enough to be concerned about it.</p> <p>\"I've heard that several candidates have had to step down because of minor criminal convictions when they were teenagers,\" says the adult social care adviser. \"I'm also wary because we seem to be going to get people with no background in the police who see things from a business point of view. We need a balance between business efficiency and meeting the needs of the voters.\"</p> <p>That fear may be misplaced, along with predictions that political extremists or law-and-order populists would rush to fill the 41 new posts across England and Wales: an English Defence League (EDL) candidate is standing in Bedfordshire, but there is little evidence of the EDL, British National Party or wannabe Clint Eastwoods making much impact so far, though there are colonels and ex-police superintendents aplenty, an air marshal and at least one ex-SAS man.</p> <p>Ministers deplore what they dismiss as \"anti-democratic pessimism\" about their experiment. Critics, who include the Electoral Reform Society (ERS), say the government has only itself to blame for negative publicity when it floats an important initiative, but does so hastily and on the cheap. Even the minister driving the policy quit this week.</p> <p>The predictable result is that in Leicestershire \u2013 as elsewhere \u2013 the most that voters seem to have registered is a string of complaints about hastily-drafted rules. The ban on magistrates standing was reversed last month, but not the ban on youthful convictions. Last week veteran councillor Mike Quigley, 65, stood down as Tory choice in Nottinghamshire over a drink-related offence committed on his 21st birthday. In Derby Labour's candidate, Alan Charles, was first told he was debarred and then reinstated \u2013 over a conditional discharge when he was 14.</p> <p>The lack of state funding available for candidates, even for the traditional free mailshot to every voter, may add to such confusion. Even the usually bullish Electoral Reform Society predicts turnout may be only 18.5%, half the modest level for local elections each May, not in autumn damp and dark.</p> <p>\"No one has a clue how these elections will work out,\" warns Sam Chapman, a Lancashire councillor and ex-police officer who reports on all 41 campaigns on his invaluable <a href=\"http://topofthecops.com/\" title=\"\">TopoftheCops</a> website.</p> <p>Despite airy assurances from Nick Herbert, who resigned as police minister for unrelated reasons in this week's reshuffle, that the internet, local and social media will fill the gap, all candidates seem agreed it is going to be a struggle relying on hustings and radio phone-ins.</p> <p>Leicestershire, which includes the micro-county of Rutland, is one of the smaller police authority areas to vote on 15 November, and has only 2,000 officers.</p> <p>So far the contest here is no more or less typical than elsewhere except that the Tory flag-bearer, Sir Clive Loader, is an ex-Harrier combat pilot, later an air chief marshal of the RAF, the most senior military candidate standing. He happens to live locally in Wing. The winner of a three-man shortlist, Loader, 58, currently faces a Labour city councillor, Sarah Russell, 32, and Suleman Nagdi, 55, an independent. Others may still stand.</p> <p>A soft-spoken businessman and community activist as well as a spokesman for the city's large Muslim population, Nagdi's extensive contacts reach into Whitehall and the police training college at Bramshill, Hampshire. A former teenage refugee from east Africa, he is now a deputy lord lieutenant of Leicestershire, with two sons in the police. Nagdi is respected, Russell is a popular deputy mayor, but Loader is the man that reporters spot popping into police HQ to talk policy. Though the rural \"doughnut\" around Labour Leicester is pretty Tory (seven of the area's 10 MPs) he insists the result could be close.</p> <p>The government's theory for bringing in directly elected commissioners was that a suitable supply of public-spirited, independent-minded candidates would materialise, willing to risk losing their \u00a35,000 deposit (the threshold to save it is a 5% vote), raise their own campaign funds and take the flak for four years if elected to the \u00a365,000-\u00a3100,000 jobs.</p> <p>The new officers are not just about setting police budgets and priorities, sacking the chief constable if necessary. They will be police and <em>crime</em> commissioners (PCCs). As such, they will be \"public safety mayors\", galvanising councils and other local partners, driving improvements in the whole criminal justice system. That includes sluggish courts, child protection, victim support and problem family management \u2013 as well as replacing shadowy police authorities in holding their force to account.</p> <p>In the language of the \"new localism\" that means refocusing away from Home Office or party priorities towards voter concerns. It is the long-term crime-reducing side of the brief that most exercises thoughtful candidates in Leicester and elsewhere, aware that some voters will prefer headline-grabbing gimmicks to patient slog.</p> <p>\"The voters' priority in Leicester and Leicestershire is neighbourhood policing and how to keep it in the face of cuts,\" says Russell, the Labour candidate.</p> <p>When Labour ministers flirted with the idea of electing PCCs, to make the police more responsive to voters' priorities for crime and justice, the police led the charge against the idea. Ministers then backed off. But David Cameron and Theresa May were not to be deterred and have pressed ahead despite flagging coalition poll ratings and unpopular cuts in police budgets that could play badly for them in November.</p> <p>Rival party moods feel different. Labour opposed the Tories' PCC legislation, but knows it must field candidates \u2013 unlike the cash-strapped Lib Dems, who have decided not to organise nationally (likewise the Greens and Plaid Cymru). But the Lib Dems' leader, Nick Clegg (who had these elections delayed from May), will not stop local associations getting involved \u2013 or backing independents.</p> <p>Some will, including Avon and Somerset, where Lib Dems reckon their councillor Peter Levy has a chance in a supplementary voting system. Will coalition loyalty deliver second preference votes \u2013 unless Ukip stands as it plans to in most contests? Tactical voting could be important. In Birmingham a Lib Dem councillor, Ayoub Khan, is eyeing the post, one of the few ethnic minority candidates in mainstream contention.</p> <p>Ahead in opinion polls, Ed Miliband should be optimistic. But Labour looks at sprawling county-based policy authority constituencies and knows the formula favours the Conservatives, the opposite of the rural/suburban \"wasted votes\" complaint at general elections. Despite Tony Blair's best efforts, law and order remains a Tory cultural issue that excites their activist base \u2013 and cash \u2013 more than Labour's. Who better to lead the charge against police budget cuts, so the shires argument runs, than a retired colonel or a lantern-jawed air marshal who once led the RAF's 31,000 personnel and handled a budget of \u00a32.5bn?</p> <p>These are unprecedented elections for unusual jobs in untested constituencies, a contest with plenty of theories and irrelevant polling data but no satnav. Turnout will be crucial and good independent candidates know it will be tough to generate voter awareness without a familiar party wrapper \u2013 unless they are already high-profile local crime-fighters or celebs. In such large constituencies merely appealing to the anti-politics mood of voters will probably not be enough to win.</p> <p>So, despite its hard-done-by moans and earlier selection of candidates (all done by mid-June), Labour can hope to win a minority of the 41 posts, mostly in the big metropolitan forces (London has no election because as an elected mayor, Boris Johnson is already a de facto PCC), including Manchester, where the sitting MP, Tony Lloyd, got a clear run at the party's nomination. Eyebrows were raised at suspected deals over the Manchester seat Lloyd will vacate. He is one of seven Labour MPs and MEPs, past and present, in contention.</p> <p>In Hampshire a row is bubbling over the selection of retired Tory MP, Michael Mates. A spritely ex-colonel and security minister, Mates is now 78 and unrepentant over his high-profile support for Asil Nadir, the jailed Polly Peck fraudster.</p> <p>In the West Midlands the favourite to win is another Labour politician, the Wolverhampton councillor Bob Jones, who brought in his defeated rival, Yvonne Mosquito, as his prospective deputy. Jones deplores the \"Americanisation\" of UK policing, but that is another lurking misapprehension. There are dozens of models of US police accountability, none of them quite like Britain's new one. America's most famous reformist cop, Bill (\"Broken Windows\") Bratton, was appointed or elected in three different ways to run \u2013 not merely oversee \u2013 the New York, Los Angeles and Boston forces.</p> <p>In South Wales \u2013 with its 1 million voters from Swansea to Cardiff and the Valleys \u2013 another MP, the former Welsh secretary and first minister, Alun Michael, won the Labour nomination, and his son, Tal, won the nomination in North Wales after resigning as the force's chief executive. His success is less certain than his father's.</p> <p>Also doubtful is that of Hamish Sandison, a Labour barrister fighting Gwent. His independent rivals include an ex-police sergeant, Chris Wright, and Ian Johnston, the Gwent force's own ex-chief superintendent.</p> <p>As in mainstream politics, women make up barely 20% of declared candidates. On Merseyside the Blairite Jane Kennedy, a former security minister in Belfast, beat a fellow ex-minister, the combative Peter Kilfoyle, and the police authority chair, Bill Weightman, to the Labour nomination. Voter hopes are high that the winner will stand up to what is widely seen there as a tradition of arrogant and heavy-handed policing.</p> <p>Most famous of all among the Westminster and Strasbourg retreads seeking election is Lord Prescott, 74, but still restless for elective action. The former MP for Hull East beat a Humberside local police chief, Keith Hunter, by only 552 votes to 458 in the party ballot and made himself a tempting target in the process. Ukip's local MEP, Geoffrey Bloom, is one of those trying to topple him one last time: a contest to watch.</p> <p>In Northamptonshire Ukip is backing Jim MacArthur, whose CV includes a stint in the SAS \u2013 though it is Labour's nominee, the union official Lee Barron, who has boldly promised officers will spend 90% of their time on the street.</p> <p>Sam Chapman (Tory runner-up to Tim Ashton in Lancashire) believes Ukip has \"a very significant opportunity\" on 15 November to expand its appeal beyond Euroscepticism. The party says it knows it and is weeding out sub-standard applicants that might embarrass it. Nominations formally open on 8 October and close on 19 October.</p> <p>Elected PCCs will take over from police authorities a week after polling day (transition teams are hard at work) and if the Home Office's imminent publicity campaign makes its intended impact, then the PCCs will soon feel the heat of public expectation. The job is comparable to being a minister of state in Whitehall, but far more exposed, says Alun Michael.</p> <p>The history of devolving power from Whitehall is littered with fiasco and retreat, especially in England, where Labour's hopes for regional government were rejected in referendums, as were Tory plans last May for elected city mayors \u2013 except in Bristol, which will elect its mayor on 15 November too.</p> <p>Elected PCCs have been imposed without any pilots, let alone local referendums. It could be another flop \u2013 or an unexpected success. Most voters may be ignorant of the concept, but they know what they want. \"More police on the streets would be nice,\" snaps one man in Leicester. \"It was a big mistake closing our police station,\" says another outside Tesco in Oakham, the county town of Rutland. \"My impression is that they're taking our police officers away and it's all being done now from far away in Leicester.\"</p> <p>Squaring the divergent circles of perception and reality against a background of cuts will be the task facing Leicestershire's new PCC and other lucky winners as winter draws in.</p>",
  "<p>Sir Richard Branson has accused the government of failing to follow its own rules by accepting an \"absolutely preposterous\" bid from FirstGroup to run the west coast railway.</p> <p>In a parliamentary showdown between the head of Virgin and rivals from British railways, Branson told the transport select committee inquiry that awarding the west coast main line franchise to FirstGroup was like \"renting out your house to the one who offers to pay twice the rent in 10 years' time [despite] being burnt three times already\".</p> <p>However, Tim O'Toole, chief executive of FirstGroup, accused Virgin of peddling \"outrageous\" versions of history, and of making guesses about a bid they had not seen.</p> <p>The government last month announced it had awarded FirstGroup the rights to the west coast main line, one of Britain's most lucrative rail franchises.</p> <p>However, Virgin applied for a judicial review hours before the signing of the contract on 28 August.</p> <p>City analysts and the RMT union have joined Virgin in querying FirstGroup's bid.</p> <p>Branson, who has run the route since 1997, claims the sums mean FirstGroup will follow National Express and GNER in not seeing out the franchise commitments.</p> <p>In a furious attack on the Department for Transport, Branson said officials had been taken for a ride by the bid: \"They've thrown this enormous cheque at the end of the franchise and somehow got away with it.\"</p> <p>Branson said Virgin had spent \u00a350m on four failed franchise bids, twice losing out on the east coast line when the winners eventually failed to honour their contracts.</p> <p>He said: \"At some point you have to draw a line. We'd much rather the DfT was open and transparent, and then we wouldn't have to go to court.\"</p> <p>FirstGroup, the UK's largest rail operator, bid a basic \u00a35.5bn to run the line until 2026. The sum was \u00a3700m more than Virgin offered. With a likely extension and inflation, the difference rises to \u00a31bn-\u00a32bn.</p> <p>Virgin's lawsuit claims that the DfT's procurement process did not correctly assess the risk of FirstGroup defaulting, with guarantees far below the premiums it would have to otherwise pay.</p> <p>But O'Toole described Virgin's allegations as \"flat-out wrong\" and \"just another guess they have made about our bid\". Later he promised: \"The rent is coming in regular instalments.\"</p> <p>He said the larger sums were due to compounding growing passenger numbers and revenues in the last years of the franchise, where Virgin was predicting flat growth. He said: \"Even with a railway stuffed to the gills like Great Western you can achieve growth.\"</p> <p>He hit back at Virgin's comparison with the previous east coast debacle, saying: \"The most outrageous thing is the history Virgin presented. Virgin would have been crushed, it would have defaulted [had it won the franchise].\"</p> <p>He denied excessive risk in FirstGroup's current bid, but said: \"This will require a lot of hard work. There is always risk. We just think we will be able to handle it.\"</p> <p>It emerged in the hearing that the DfT had demanded a greater surety from FirstGroup, pushing up the bond from \u00a350m and settling on \u00a3200m, although at one point FirstGroup had offered \u00a315m more.</p> <p>A Virgin spokesman said the DfT needed be \"upfront about these last-minute, behind the scenes, negotiations with taxpayers' money\".</p> <p>The DfT said it was unable to confirm any negotiations which were confidential and the subject of legal proceedings.</p> <p>A spokesman said: \"The department was involved in active dialogue with all bidders about the details of their proposals.\"</p> <p>The department has said it would increase its focus on contingency planning in case Virgin's legal action meant FirstGroup could not take over the franchise on 9 December.</p> <p>One option was taking the line into state control in the interim. Directly Operated Railways, the government company now running the east coast line, was reported to be looking at the running of the line.</p> <p>Branson reiterated his offer on Monday to continue to ing running run services for free pending the high court's legal decision. But the DfT was not thought to be keen.</p> <p>Speaking afterwards, O'Toole said he had met west coast railway staff and that FirstGroup was pressing ahead for the change of ownership on deadline. \"The only fact you know is, no matter what happens Virgin is leaving on 9 December.\"</p>",

  "<p>I always dread the first few weeks of September. I often haven't written for weeks and usually not much has happened. Sadly, that can't be said of this summer. It is hard to know where to start, but a few points stand out.</p> <p>The first is that any doubt about this government's toxic brand of ideology, incoherence and incompetence must surely be laid to rest. There may be a small parallel universe of Tory rightwingers who dream of the 1950s and think the current policy mix is to be applauded. But out in the real world, it feels muddled and unsettling. Whether it was the inclusive spirit of the Olympics set against political point-scoring about school sport, millions being wasted on botched free-school projects, the introduction of unqualified teachers or the GCSE debacle, the ship appears to be in the hands of dogmatic amateurs.</p> <p>It is extraordinary that a secretary of state could preside over a fiasco that has damned the life chances of the young people he professes to care about (some of us doubted that, incidentally), destroy the evidence base for his other pet policy (academies), alienate many of the heads he needs to make our schools flourish, and then appear on radio blithely admitting that thousands of teenagers must now spend several years studying for an exam he claims has no integrity.</p> <p>The conspiracists may be right. The whole episode could be a cunning plan to justify a new version of the O-level but neither the political motives, the process, timescale or the inconclusive outcome of the national curriculum review bode well for what would be a major piece of education reform.</p> <p>Much as I would like to believe that thinktanks, campaigning and persuasive journalism will make a difference, the only solution to the current situation is political, and it rests with Labour.</p> <p>The Tories are on a reckless, doctrinaire mission to marketise public services. The Liberal Democrats, who had some quite good policies at the last election, seem powerless and doomed to electoral oblivion.</p> <p>The only hope is that Labour can win the next election with a coherent set of proposals that restore confidence and belief in a high-performing public education system as the route to a fairer&#xa0;society.</p> <p>Yet I feel a nagging sense of uncertainty that this will happen, and know I will receive angry, sorrowful messages from parents, governors, teachers and heads who share that doubt. But, as a Labour party member, I am given to favouring hope over experience, so here is what I hope Labour will do.</p> <p>The party appears paralysed by two issues: the fact that it started the reforms now being misused by the coalition; and a terror that it will somehow appear backward-looking if it doesn't come up with some shiny new ideas.</p> <p>But it is time to admit that the fragmentation of the school system is running out of control and the inevitable drift into profit-making schools is dangerous. We are where we are with academies and free schools, but a rigorous, fair, locally accountable regulatory structure must be put around all schools, covering everything from non-selective admissions to school improvement and standards.</p> <p>If a freedom is worth having, give it to all schools. If it is not, don't give it to any. The local authority still has a role to play here, and attempts to create something new for the sake of appearance are wasteful and unnecessary.</p> <p>Second, the qualifications and accountability systems are a mess. If the secretary of state hasn't got confidence in them, why should parents, teachers and pupils? Labour could embark on the sort of radical reform that the Tories wouldn't dare contemplate. Sweep away the GCSE in favour of a final qualification at 18, which could encompass academic and vocational routes, and would allow the middle years of secondary education to be opened up to a more enjoyable, stimulating, creative experience.</p> <p>The key to all this must be trust in, public endorsement of, and investment in highly skilled and qualified teachers. Quality and fairness are simple ideas that will appeal to most parents.</p> <p>There is an American baseball phrase \"stepping up to the plate\". It couldn't be more apt here. The time for lengthy policy reviews and small-scale opposition tactics is running out. Labour needs to step up to the plate with a bold alternative, and fast.</p>",
  "<p>I almost feel sorry for the celebrities. Almost. Because in among the usual soapstars, presenters and singers making up the Strictly lineup for 2012 are what might be the show's trump card: two Olympic medal-winning athletes who have thrilled the nation \u2013 and are gorgeous to boot. And just to really underline the standard of competition, one of them's a gymnast. Do showbiz mortals really stand a chance?</p> <p>They will certainly have to pull out all the stops to beat <strong>Louis Smith</strong>, the suave posterboy for GB men's gymnastics, who presumably has all the timing, control, fitness and grace necessary. When <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16454446\" title=\"\">you can do this</a>, the waltz must seem like a rather less daunting prospect. (Strictly's great rival The X Factor, meanwhile, must be kicking themselves: Smith auditioned for the show in 2008).</p> <p>The gymnast will be joined by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1THJ3h1snt4&amp;feature=related\" title=\"\">British cycling queen</a> <strong>Victoria Pendleton</strong>, who told the Guardian this morning that, having retired from the sport, \"I'm just going to have a year of trying new stuff.\" New stuff in this case including lorry-loads of spangles and a vat of spray tan. Makes a change from head-to-toe Lycra, I suppose.</p> <p>Producers will be hoping that the pair bring a bit of that Olympic fever to Strictly \u2013 and the casting does seem very smart. But, while the dates of the competition would admittedly have made it very difficult in terms of training, the lack of a Paralympian in the lineup does feel like a bit of an oversight.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the Strictly lineup, it's business as usual. You can't really do better than <strong>Jerry Hall</strong> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1V2IWboIUg\" title=\"\">Bond MI6 chief <strong>Colin Salmon</strong></a> for glamour factor and all-out charm, with both promising to bring a bit of class to proceedings. (Although if Nancy Dell'Olio's astonishing Strictly turn proves anything, it's that sometimes people look like they're going to be much more competent than they are.) And even with the Olympic competition, cricketer <strong>Michael Vaughan</strong> is shrewd casting given the success of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiNZTlrsRI8\" title=\"\">Darren Gough</a> and Mark Ramprakash</p> <p>I sometimes wonder if Strictly has to cast an EastEnder by law \u2013 Kara Tointon, Jessie Wallace and Scott Maslen have all appeared in recent years \u2013 and this time round it falls to dear old Rickkaaaaay, <strong>Sid Owen</strong>. Then there's the breakfast telly favourite \u2013 in this case, Daybreak's <strong>Richard Arnold</strong> \u2013 and the requisite boy/girlband members, who at least have the advantage of years of choreographed numbers. Although that's probably more true of Girls Aloud's <strong>Kimberley Walsh</strong> than it is of former Westlifer <strong>Nicky Byrne</strong>: surprisingly few Strictly routines feature sitting on a stool and standing up for the key change.</p> <p>Byrne doesn't really strike me as 2012's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwctHYUvXTo&amp;feature=relate\" title=\"\">Harry Judd from McFly</a> \u2013 although I may of course be wrong \u2013 but given that he has a background as a pro-footballer, perhaps he'll unleash his inner Robbie Savage. Hopefully <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgpCTsmOBTA\" title=\"\">with fewer groin thrusts</a>.</p> <p>What isn't obvious from the lineup is who is going to be this year's comedy turn. Russell Grant was Strictly's genius casting last autumn \u2013 game for everything, including <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYEYUOsE-LM\" title=\"\">being fired out of a cannon</a> and emerging from behind huge glittery seashells. Grant had charm and, it must be said, some grace on the dancefloor. Certainly he was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2snk9HhLp0&amp;feature=relmfu\" title=\"\">no Ann Widdecombe</a>.</p> <p>I'm not sure there's anyone who seems to quite fit that mould: no politicians certain to have two left feet <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urb0dpHJX2w\" title=\"\">or grumpy John Sergeant type characters</a>; no performers with quite the same sense of camp. I imagine that <strong>Johnny Ball</strong> \u2013 at 74, Strictly's oldest-ever contestant \u2013 will be fun to watch. (Not least when he's being interviewed by daughter Zoe on It Takes Two.) But I also imagine he could be a quite nifty dancer. Ditto <strong>Lisa Riley</strong>. Although the joy of Grant, of course, was that he was something of a surprise hit. I probably wouldn't have predicted his success either.</p> <p>Or perhaps this is the year that Strictly gets a bit more serious. Certainly the lineup includes people who have already proved they can dance. Both <strong>Fern Britton</strong> and Tracey Beaker star <strong>Dani Harmer</strong> have already shimmied for the cameras: Britton giving a creditable performance in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh_Bzj4L_gs\" title=\"\">the 2010 Christmas special</a>, and Harmer pulling out <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOdPYFlEhXs\" title=\"\">a jolly Bugsy Malone routine</a> with Tyger Drew-Honey for Sports Relief. <strong>Denise Van Outen</strong>, meanwhile, is already (and slightly controversially) a West End star. The most amazing thing about her appearance is surely that it's taken them this long to cast her.</p> <p>So what do you make of the lineup? Let us know in the comments</p> <p><em>\u2022 Join Heidi Stephens for our Strictly liveblog on Saturday 15 September from 6.30pm as we meet the celebrities for the first time.</em></p>",
  "<p>Teachers in Chicago took to the picket lines for the first time in 25 years Monday after unions and the city's school district failed to reach agreement over a new contract.</p> <p>The strike marks the latest phase in an acrimonious, months-long dispute between Mayor Rahm Emanuel \u2013 a man not known for his consensual management style \u2013 and a union that has seen its base energised under strident new leadership.</p> <p>The effects were felt throughout the city after parents received automated calls from the school board on Sunday evening informing them of the action. The message, coming just one week after the new academic year began for most students, said there would be no school, and informed parents of makeshift arrangements at libraries and other drop-off sites around the city.</p> <p>At the centre of the dispute is Emanuel's attempt to reform the city's schools in a manner that would put a greater emphasis on test results when evaluating teachers, and demands for increased pay for a longer working day \u2013 plus a promise that teachers laid off in a widely anticipated series of school closings will be hired when new vacancies occur.</p> <p>On Monday morning, both sides said they were close on pay but still had considerable distance to go on the question of evaluation and job security.</p> <p>On the picket line outside Helen C Pierce school, Chris Inserra, a parent, said she was there to support the teachers because \"they believe in children\". \"How can you evaluate a teacher who is at the toughest school in one of the roughest neighbourhoods, with all the problems that come with that, in the same way as a teacher in one of the best schools with the best resources?\"</p> <p>Jennifer Foss, the school's middle school co-ordinator, said her main concern was that they had not been provided with adequate resources to staff the longer school day, but she also worried about evaluation. \"It's not that I don't think we should be evaluated,\" she said. \"But it shouldn't be attached to test scores. That can have a very divisive effect in a school and students respond to teachers in very different ways.\"</p> <p>The confrontation, the first teachers' strike in a generation, has been brewing since Emanuel made school reform the centrepiece of his election campaign last year. Not long after he took office Emanuel reneged on a teachers pay increase that had been negotiated. He then sought to extend the school day in return for a 2% pay increase, which was rejected by the union. It was thought that a new state law requiring 75% of eligible union members to support a strike would have forestalled industrial action.</p> <p>But things have not gone his way. A poll in May revealed that parents of Chicago schoolchildren were almost three times more likely to back the unions than Emanuel.</p> <p>Then, an independent arbitrator ruled that teachers should receive raises of between 15% and 20% for a longer working day, and criticised the school board for trying to extend the longer day during such tough times. When the union did put the strike to a ballot it received more than 90% support from its members for strike action.</p> <p>The city accuses the union, whose leadership has taken a left turn in recent times, of being intransigent and demanding concessions that the city cannot afford or that will detrimentally affect students. \"This is avoidable, because it is a strike of choice,\" claimed Emanuel. \"This is about as much as we can do,\" insisted David Vitale, the president of the school board. \"There is only so much money in the system.\"</p> <p>The two sides did reach an agreement in July where the school board would rehire almost 500 teachers in non-core subjects like art and music who had been laid off to staff the longer day. But since then progress has stalled.</p> <p>Union officials and teachers insist the strike is not primarily about money. Indeed, the recurring theme on the picket line was a grievance far more heartfelt and difficult to negotiate \u2013 respect, and a sense of being professionally undervalued. At a community-led strike school, set up to support the teachers, Inez Jacobson, a retired teacher who worked for 30 years in the city's schools, said: \"Teachers have a very difficult job. They're trained professionals. They deserve better. You can't just put anybody in a classroom and get good results.</p> <p>\"If you evaluate them on test scores then they'll teach test taking skills. But that's not education. Kids learn in very different ways so that's no way to evaluate a good teacher.\"</p> <p>The strike could have national ramifications, and risks becoming an issue in the presidential campaign. Emanuel was President Obama's chief of staff and the strike is taking place in Obama's hometown.</p> <p>Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney blamed both the union and Obama: \"I am disappointed by the decision of the Chicago Teachers Union to turn its back on not only a city negotiating in good faith, but also the hundreds of thousands of children relying on the city's public schools to provide them a safe place to receive a strong education.</p> <p>\"President Obama has chosen his side in this fight, sending his vice-president last year to assure the nation's largest teachers union that: 'You should have no doubt about my affection for you and the president's commitment to you.' \"</p> <p>The White House is believed to be keeping its distance in the hope of a speedy resolution.</p>",
  "<p>The notion that the post-deal boardroom survival of Sir John Bond could be regarded as a gift to Xstrata's shareholders is surely Ivan Glasenberg's idea of a joke. Whatever else Xstrata shareholders think about Glencore's improved terms (and there's a wide range of views out there), there's no campaign to save Bond and install him as chairman of a Glenstrata combo.</p> <p>Bond's first mistake in February was to agree an all-share deal with a tiny takeover premium of 8%. The rationale then was that the two companies were merging as equals. Yeah, right. The merger-of-equals idea was always a nonsense, as Glasenberg has now brutally demonstrated with his proposal that Xstrata chief Mick Davis must go, albeit with six months to say his goodbyes. So much for Glasenberg's previous acquiescence with the line that Davis' presence was critical to future operational success. What Glasenberg really thinks is he can do a better job himself.</p> <p>Bond's second mistake was to propose an absurdly generous \u00a3170m retention package for Davis and 80 Xstrata executives, supposedly to protect the interests of shareholders in a \"merged\" company. On this logic, it is now more dangerous for Xstrata shareholders to accept Glencore paper because the new deal is closer to a takeover, with Davis departing early. But it's a tricky argument to make because Bond was prepared to deal at 2.8. Refusing to recommend 3.05 will look \u2013 fairly or not \u2013 like an attempt to protect Xstrata management's bumper rewards. In other words, Bond has cut the negotiating ground from beneath his own feet.</p> <p>What should he have done? Recognised at the outset that the merger-of-equals idea was a nonsense; championed Xstrata's long-term prospects as a standalone company; and invited Glasenberg to pay up in full for 100% control. Keep it simple, in other words, and appeal to the loyalty of shareholders.</p> <p>Yes, we all know that having a 34% shareholder makes life uncomfortable. But the net result now is that Xstrata's shareholders are in serious danger of receiving a takeover premium of just 17% on the pre-talks level. If you're in Glencore's shoes, the figure is 27% because of the weakness in Xstrata's share price after the fall in commodity prices this year. Okay, but Bond &amp; co could surely have reached, and probably surpassed, even that figure if they had employed some Glasenberg-style hardball tactics at the outset. Time was on their side: Xstrata did not need to be taken over in 2012. The better moment to enter talks was 2015, when outsiders can better judge whether the heavy investment spending of the past couple of years has paid off.</p> <p>Of course, Qatar Holding, with 12% of Xstrata, could yet spring a surprise by refusing Glencore's new proposal and continuing to buy shares. That would spare Bond's blushes. But it's not the way to bet. Instead, Glasenberg looks to be close to achieving a successful bear hug, the very thing Bond was there to guard against.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron is distancing himself from his outspoken new health minister Anna Soubry, who last week called for help to be given to terminally ill patients who want to end their lives.</p> <p>Senior Tory sources said the prime minister saw no need for a change in the law or in legal guidance on the issue.</p> <p>Soubry, a former barrister on the Tory left who joined the health ministry in last week's reshuffle, told the Times on Saturday that it was \"ridiculous and appalling\" that terminally ill people had to travel abroad to end their lives.</p> <p>\"The rules that we have about who we don't prosecute allow things to happen but there's a good argument that we should be a bit more honest about it,\" the minister said.</p> <p>Soubry qualified her remarks by saying she felt ambivalence about the case of Tony Nicklinson, 58, who died recently after unsuccessfully fighting a court case for the right to have his life ended legally. Soubry said: \"I don't know where I am with that one. I really feel that you can't say to a doctor 'kill'. It was a fascinating moral and legal case. You can't say to a doctor or a nurse you can kill this person.\"</p> <p>Downing Street indicated on Monday that the Nicklinson case could prompt a rethink of the rules. The prime minister's spokesman said: \"There has been some debate over the course of the last week. The Nicklinson family case has raised very profound moral and ethical issues. There are very strong arguments on both sides of the debate. It is an issue that will no doubt be debated further in the future. But it is one for parliament to decide and it is always an issue of conscience.\"</p> <p>It is understood that the spokesman's comments were designed to highlight the way in which parliament may debate the issues raised by the Nicklinson case over the coming months. This would be a matter for parliament, not the government, and MPs would have a free vote if one were held.</p> <p>Tory sources said the prime minister's personal view was that there was no need for a change in the law and no need to revise the guidelines for England and Wales outlined by Keir Starmer, the director of public prosecutions. In 2010 Starmer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/feb/25/dpp-assisted-suicide-guidelines-starmer-purdy\" title=\"\">outlined six factors</a> that could militate against prosecuting an individual who had assisted the suicide of another person.</p> <p>A Tory source said: \"There are no plans afoot on assisted suicide. Anna Soubry is not road-testing a great new government debate. Any vote in parliament would be free. It is the prime minister's long-held view that there is no need for a change in the law, though he had enormous sympathy for the Nicklinson family.\"</p>",
  "<p>Good for the Republicans trying to mix it up, color-wise. Speakers at their convention last month included South Carolina Governor Nimrata \"Nikki\" Haley, whose parents emigrated from the Punjab, and Mia Love, a Haitian-American Mormon running for congress in Utah. They reached out to Latinos with New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez and Florida Senator Marco Rubio, and to African Americans with former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Craig Romney, the nominee's youngest son, even gave a speech in Spanish.</p> <p>But a few sprinkles of chocolate and caramel don't change the overall flavour: Republicans are <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/118937/republican-base-heavily-white-conservative-religious.aspx\">still vanilla</a>. A <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/daily/romney-and-black-voters-an-uneasy-relationship-20120827\">recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showed that among African Americans</a>, Mitt Romney polls at 0%. Yes, zero. That doesn't mean absolutely no black people will vote for him: former presidential candidate and pizza king Herman Cain says he will. So do Representative Allen \"Democrats are Communists\" West, of Florida, and Texas Congresswoman Stefani Carter, who has just been named to Romney's \"Black Leadership Council.\" But the poll data mean that very, very few African Americans, fewer than the poll's 3% margin of error, support Romney. </p> <p>He does better with Latinos: between 25% and 30% (pick your poll) claim they're willing to give the ticket a whirl. Nevertheless, if the Republicans are to win in November, they will have to do it with <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/08/2012-or-never-for-gops-white-base.html\">white voters</a>. Romney's own campaign numbers gurus say he needs at least 61% of them. </p> <p>That might work \u2013 this year. But it will probably never work again. White America is shrinking. In 2012, for the first time in modern history, the majority of babies born in the US belonged to some kind of \"ethnic minority\". According to the Census Bureau, in 25 to 30 years, non-Hispanic whites will no longer make up a majority of the US population. If the Republican party continues to cling to plutocracy, misogyny, homophobia, and racial division, it will be, as President George HW Bush (surely the whitest of white men ever to occupy the White House) would say, \"in deep doo-doo\".</p> <p>South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, one of the GOP's brighter bulbs, worries that they're \"losing the demographic race\". He told the Washington Post:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We're not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Ed Rollins, a senior strategist, agrees, calling his party \"a bunch of old white guys\", who are ignoring the way the country is heading:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We need to basically broaden the base, we need to have more women, we need to have more Latinos, we need to have more African-Americans.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Good luck, gents. Most American women are pretty keen on getting equal pay for equal work, now made easier by the 2009 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/06/republican-gender-gap-mirrors-womens-pay-disparity?newsfeed=true\">Lilly Ledbetter Act</a>. Paul Ryan, along with most Republicans in the House of Representatives, voted against it. Women also want to be in charge of their, you know, lady-parts. Yet Republican-controlled state legislatures have tripped over themselves to introduce laws forcing women seeking an abortion to undergo transvaginal ultrasounds to get, as one pious supporter called it, <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/03/transvaginal-ultrasounds-coming-soon-state-near-you\">\"a window into her womb\"</a>. This year's Republican platform document declares that since \"life\" begins at the nanosecond of conception, abortion is verboten \u2013 even if the woman has been raped, even if carrying a pregnancy to term would jeopardise her health. Zygotes: good. Women wielding vaginas: bad.</p> <p>Republicans wonder why \"family values\"-loving Latinos favor godless, gay-marriage-promoting Democrats over them. Surely, it can't just be because conservatives loudly disparage Latino language and culture, denounce the Dream Act, defend the indefensible Sheriff Joe <a href=\"http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/valleyfever/2012/07/sheriff_arpaio_struggles_to_an.php\">\"Mexicans are dirty\"</a> Arpaio, and see nothing wrong with a little racial profiling (in 2010, a California congressman confidently asserted that he could identify the undocumented <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2010/04/22/196971/rep-brian-bilbray-says-he-can-spot-illegal-immigrants-based-on-their-shoes/\">by their shoes</a>) is no reason not to sign up.</p> <p>And why are black folks so perversely resistant to joining the party of Abraham Lincoln? Could it be because it's also the party of Richard Nixon, whose \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/books/phillips-southern.pdf\">Southern Strategy</a>\" exploited fear of integration to transform the Republicans from a socially progressive (if fiscally conservative) party into a paranoid, racist-dogwhistling bunch of pro-gun, anti-science, anti-government fundamentalists whose political base is circling the wagons in the Old Confederacy? Could it be those Romney campaign ads with all the industrious white folks which state, wrongly, that Obama <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/28/rick-santorum/Santorum-Romney-claim-Obama-endging-welfare-work/\">waived the work requirement for welfare</a>?</p> <p>Or could it be the way even the so-called adults of the Republican party have tolerated and sometimes encouraged the constant birtherism of their Tea Party-infused co-religionists? Donald Trump's absurd assurances that Barack Obama's birth certificate is fake, Mitt Romney's birth certificate \"joke\", the bullfrog chorus of Republicans from John Sununu to Sarah Palin repeatedly croaking that Obama is a socialist/radical/elitist hell-bent on transforming America into France all sound like code for \"Oh God! He's a Negro!\" CNN presenter Soledad O'Brien put this to a Tea Party leader who dismissed it. She simply <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/80654.html#ixzz25oOJ0I1C\">\"doesn't believe that he loves America the way that we do\"</a>. </p> <p>Every time Republicans seem to be making at least cosmetic progress toward inclusiveness, some old white guy shows up and tears off the mask of tolerance: Clint Eastwood talking to an imaginary (though angry and profane) black man in front of millions of people; an apparently-mummified Chuck Norris and his pale wife warning that if Obama is re-elected, your children face <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/chuck-norris-warns-1000-years-darkness-obama-elected/story?id=17152039\">\"1,000 years of darkness\"</a>.</p> <p>This is what happens when you wrap yourself in the flag so tightly that oxygen can't get to your brain.

  "<p>What are we to make of a show that calls itself <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/sep/09/art-change-china-hayward-review\" title=\"\">Art of Change: New Directions from China</a>? I don't think it's worth discussing new directions in the context of Chinese art \u2013 there were no old directions, either. Chinese art has never had any clear orientation. Yes, the artists in this exhibition, which opened at the Hayward gallery in London last week, have struggled against the limitations imposed by the Chinese state more stridently than others. But that doesn't change the fact that this is just another attempt to introduce western audiences to so-called \"contemporary Chinese art\". How can you have a show of \"contemporary Chinese art\" that doesn't address a single one of the country's most pressing contemporary issues?</p> <p>I am very familiar with the work of most of the artists in the show. Their work is certainly Chinese but, overall, the show casts no critical eye. It is like a restaurant in Chinatown that sells all the standard dishes, such as kung pao chicken and sweet and sour pork. People will eat it and say it is Chinese, but it is simply a consumerist offering, providing little in the way of a genuine experience of life in China today.</p> <p>Widespread state control over art and culture has left no room for freedom of expression in the country. For more than 60 years, anyone with a dissenting opinion has been suppressed. Chinese art is merely a product: it avoids any meaningful engagement. There is no larger context. Its only purpose is to charm viewers with its ambiguity.</p> <p>The Chinese art world does not exist. In a society that restricts individual freedoms and violates human rights, anything that calls itself creative or independent is a pretence. It is impossible for a totalitarian society to create anything with passion and imagination.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396171487\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/10/1347298808375/Peng-Yu-008.jpg\" alt=\"Peng Yu\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Detail from Peng Yu and Sun Yuan's I Didn't Notice What I am Doing (2012) at Art of Change: New Directions from China.

Its booming economy has triggered an appetite and a curiosity around the world for its art and culture, one that continues to grow. I can, however, tell people that it is a show with no actor. The Chinese government is spending billions on \"soft power\" initiatives, desperately promoting cultural exchanges with the west, with the goal of presenting itself as a civilised nation. These are superficial gestures, no different from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jun/10/china.usa\" title=\"\">the ping-pong diplomacy practised in the 1970s by Chairman Mao</a>: American table-tennis players were invited into the country to play fun matches and thereby facilitate some sort of political relationship. In a similar vein, giant pandas were given as gifts to various countries to strengthen diplomatic ties.</p> <p>Last year, we saw <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/17/china-celebrity-ad-campaign-hu-jintao\" title=\"\">China bringing its propaganda right into New York's Times Square</a>. In an advertising push that the state news agency Xinhua described as a \"public diplomacy campaign\", billboard-size screens played videos that featured martial-arts movie star <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/jackie-chan\" title=\"\">Jackie Chan</a>, basketball player <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/picture/2012/aug/15/yao-ming-africa-poaching-crisis-big-picture\" title=\"\">Yao Ming</a>, astronaut <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jun/06/china-stage-managing-news\" title=\"\">Yang Liwei</a>, and pianists <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/lang-lang\" title=\"\">Lang Lang</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/mar/18/yundi-chopin-review\" title=\"\">Li Yundi</a>. Meanwhile <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2007/nov/06/highereducation.internationaleducationnews\" title=\"\">Confucius Institutes, promoting Chinese culture, are spreading all over the world</a>, as are Chinese travelling acrobatic troupes. To me, these are an insult to human intelligence and a ridicule of the concept of culture \u2013 vehicles of propaganda that showcase skills with no substance, and crafts with&#xa0;no meaning.</p> <p>Although Chinese art is heavily influenced by contemporary western culture, it rejects the essential human values that underpin it. The Chinese Communist party claims to deliver socialism with Chinese characteristics, but nobody understands what this means \u2013 including the people of China. Given this, and their lack of self-identity, there is no reason to expect a show of Chinese art created in the west to critique the system effectively. But any show curated without respect for the people's struggle, without concern for an artist's need for honest self-expression, will inevitably lead to the wrong conclusion. Anything that calls itself a cultural exchange is artificial when it lacks any critical content. What's needed is open discussion, a platform for argument. Art needs to stand for something.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Art of Change: New Directions from China is at the Hayward Gallery, London SE1, until 7 December.</em></p>",
  "<p>Every profile of Felicity Jones&nbsp;tends to breathlessly announce that the actor is&nbsp;on the brink of superstardom, though since <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/columnists/article-560366/Archers-star-Felicity-Jones-target-make-big-splash.html\" title=\"\">these interviews go back to 2008</a>,&nbsp;you wonder how long this can continue. \"I understand it,\" she says. \"It's a way of selling something. I think you have to zone a lot of those things out, and people will take notice when you do something interesting.\"</p> <p>Of course, judging success by fame is too blunt a measure for an actor who insists she picks her jobs according to how interesting she finds them, not on whether they will catapult her on to magazine covers: she turned down the lead in the big-budget <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgbH05rQx1s\" title=\"\">Mirror Mirror</a>, with Julia Roberts as the evil queen, to be in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2011/jun/13/luise-miller-review\" title=\"\">Michael Grandage's production of Friedrich Schiller's Luise Miller</a> at the Donmar in London. I get the feeling, moments after meeting her in a cafe around the corner from where she lives (a hipsterish bit of east London), that attention is not what drives her. She is self-contained, quiet. At first glance girl-next-door pretty, she is more interesting-looking than that: large, green-gold eyes and bone structure delicate as a sparrow.</p> <p>In her latest film, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1435513/\" title=\"\">Hysteria</a>, Jones plays Emily, the dutiful daughter of a doctor who specialises in treating women with \"hysteria\" \u2013 a condition that covered everything from anxiety and depression to reckless behaviour. This could only be treated by a doctor reaching under the petticoats and applying manual stimulation until a paroxysm ensued (female orgasms were never spoken about). When a young doctor, played by Hugh Dancy, finds the work a strain, he comes up with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/07/how-the-vibrator-caused-buzz\" title=\"\">the electric vibrator</a>. \"It was funny and I liked the idea of it \u2013 that an Englishman would have invented the vibrator in the Victorian period,\" she says. \"The idea that hysteria was this catch-all term to describe any sort of psychological condition in a woman \u2026 \" She smiles. \"I felt like I wanted to play someone a little bit silly.\"</p> <p>And Jones, 28, looks very at home in a bonnet. She has done several period dramas: in 2007, she played <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM0SGTJCaKU\" title=\"\">Catherine Morland in the television adaptation of Northanger Abbey</a>, and in her next film \u2013 The Invisible Woman, based on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/sep/25/claire-tomalin-biographer-charles-dickens\" title=\"\">Claire Tomalin</a>'s book about Charles Dickens's mistress Nelly Ternan \u2013 she plays opposite Ralph Fiennes (who also directs). \"I enjoyed watching those kinds of films when I was growing up \u2013 Room with a View, Howards End,\" she says. \"I guess I'm a bit of a romantic. I&nbsp;feel the period has to become irrelevant and you're just dealing with people. I don't think characters have changed, it's the forces that work on them that have.\"</p> <p>There have been more contemporary roles, too. She was the lead in the romantic comedy <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pn4Kqy06dw\" title=\"\">Chalet Girl</a>, and was&nbsp;in Ricky Gervais's film <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6mWBdTelT8\" title=\"\">Cemetery Junction</a>. Before that, there were a number of low-budget British films that got middling reviews and then seemed to disappear, including <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1541149/\" title=\"\">Albatross</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_6NS_lLgis\" title=\"\">Soul Boy</a>. Then, last year, Jones seemed to step up a level when she won a special jury prize at the Sundance film festival for her role in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2035886/\" title=\"\">Drake Doremus</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/jan/26/like-crazy-review\" title=\"\">Like Crazy</a>, the largely improvised indie film (which also took the best film prize) about a long-distance relationship. The reception, she says, \"was phenomenal, especially because it wasn't expected in any way\". She is in the director's next film, too. Is this going to be a lifelong actor-director partnership? \"I would love to. I think probably we need a bit of a break from each other, but definitely, in the future.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4xvU4uHwQEg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4xvU4uHwQEg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xvU4uHwQEg\">Reading this on mobile?

She laughs. \"I have been told,\" she says. Would she do it? \"It would depend on the script. I wouldn't dismiss it. I&nbsp;love this idea of YouTube casting, or casting through Twitter. I think that's going to become more powerful.\" The internet is exciting for&nbsp;film-makers, she says. \"It was fascinating to experience something like Like Crazy, which was made completely independently, just a group of people deciding they wanted to make a film. Increasingly, that will happen and there needs to be a platform, like an online cinema where you can watch these microbudget films.\" She has just finished working on a short film with a friend. \"It's a time when the cost of making a film is so low it means you can make really fascinating, weird and amusing stories. There has been a shift. It's exciting.\"</p> <p>Jones was brought up in Bournville in Birmingham by her mother, who worked in the advertising department of the local paper; her parents divorced when she was very young. She remembers being taken to see plays regularly as a child, and when she joined a drama club at the age of 11, \"I&nbsp;found I enjoyed it more than school. There was an amazing man, Colin Edwards, who was a real mentor and still is, and he wasn't afraid to introduce us to work like Harold Pinter at a young age. I just remember thinking, 'I like this world.' It felt right.\"</p> <p>She was 12 when she got her first job in a television film, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3ymLugZat8\" title=\"\">Treasure Seekers</a>, which also starred a young Keira Knightley, and other roles soon followed: Jones was in the children's series The Worst Witch, and she played Emma Grundy in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/series/a-month-in-ambridge\" title=\"\">The Archers</a> for several years. Still, she decided not to go to drama school and chose to study English literature at university instead, Oxford as it happens, \"where I felt I could do both, be in the drama world and study at the same time. I think the benefit is I now have friends in different fields. It can be very intense being an actor, it can be quite a small world. Then you speak to your friend who is a&nbsp;scientist and they have a completely different perspective. It's good to feel [acting is] not the be-all and end-all. Is it David Mamet who says you have to&nbsp;enrich your life and that will make you a better actor? I agree with that.\"</p> <p>Were her parents worried about her becoming an actor? \"They weren't worried at all. They should have been more worried, but they were both very encouraging. I&nbsp;don't know \u2013 now there's no job&nbsp;that's stable, and that was starting to be the case when we were growing up.\"</p> <p>She says she looks at the career of Tilda Swinton as one she would like to emulate. \"I think she always does things she cares about. I&nbsp;like that she has experimented in other&nbsp;areas, like art installations. She's always exciting.\" I ask if, as a young female actor, she has felt a pressure to&nbsp;conform to an ideal, and she shakes her head and says, no, she's been lucky.&nbsp;\"But for everyone, I think, there is always a pressure to conform, and I&nbsp;guess as you get older you realise it's less interesting to do that. It starts with&nbsp;you, though, saying, 'I know what&nbsp;I like doing and that's what I'm going to do.'\"</p> <p>In the whirlwind that followed Like Crazy, Jones was feted by designers \u2013 she <a href=\"http://www.look.co.uk/fashion/meet-burberry%E2%80%99s-latest-campaign-star\" title=\"\">modelled for Burberry</a> \u2013 and directors, including Woody Allen, asked to meet her. The traditional next&nbsp;step is to move to Hollywood, which she says she would consider temporarily, \"but London will always be my home. It's nice to have some continuity you can come back to. I feel that in coming home, coming back to London.\" She lives with her long-term boyfriend, Ed Fornieles, an artist, and 20 tortoises in the garden. \"It's a shared building,\" she explains; the tortoises belong to everyone and no one. \"They're going to outlive us. They&nbsp;all get very hungry and they have to be fed, so I go and check on them in the&nbsp;morning.\"</p> <p>She isn't at a point, she says, where she can pick and choose all her roles. \"Some things come to me and other things I really have to go and fight for. It's a competitive world. You have to deal with being rejected constantly. It's like being dumped all the time.\" She laughs. \"It's horrible. I wouldn't think of myself as being a particularly strong person, but in order to stick it out you have to be.\"</p> <p>Does she watch her own films? \"I&nbsp;sometimes like to watch things just to see how I can get better, and also I just like to watch it \u2013 if you've spent two months of your life doing something it's nice to see what it became. It's useful to see what went wrong there, why didn't that work, how can I not do&nbsp;that again?\" Is she very self-critical? \"Yes, absolutely,\" she says with a smile. \"Perfectionism. It's good to do things properly, otherwise there's no point.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Hysteria is released on 21 September.</p>",
  "<p>Labour-run councils in some of England's poorest areas have cut services for vulnerable older people far more deeply than Conservative authorities during the coalition's time in power, new research finds.</p> <p>Despite rising demand for assistance, linked to the ageing population, most of the 152 local authorities in England have reduced the amount of money they spend on elderly care.</p> <p>But the biggest falls have occurred generally in England's most deprived boroughs with Labour-run local councils, according to an analysis of all authorities' spending on personal social services since 2010.</p> <p>The study, conducted by the management consultancy firm Candesic and <a href=\"http://www.healthinvestor.co.uk/ShowArticleNews.aspx?ID=2449\" title=\"reported in the business magazine HealthInvestor\">reported in the business magazine HealthInvestor</a>, shows that cuts have been made everywhere despite previous research showing that the number of people in England who need care services is likely to rise from 6 million to 7.66 million by 2030.</p> <p>Labour argues that the spending falls reflect the fact that councils in poorer areas have been hit disproportionately hard by a four-year programme of cuts to town hall budgets, which began with the 2010 comprehensive spending review.</p> <p>That led to councils tightening eligibility criteria so that fewer older people received care, and to imposing higher charges for care services.</p> <p>While the amount councils have spent on personal social services has risen from \u00a39.73bn in 2010-11 to \u00a39.98bn in 2012-13, the amount out of those budgets spent on elderly care has fallen in both actual and proportionate terms over that period \u2013 from \u00a33.45bn (35.5%) to \u00a33.19bn (32%) in the current financial year.</p> <p>The charity Age UK warned that the cuts were forcing growing numbers of needy older people to live \"frightened, isolated lives\" as the services they relied upon were gradually eroded.</p> <p>Candesic's study covers money spent on care for older people which helps them continue living at home, and on residential care home fees.</p> <p>The study, which tracks personal social services spending in 2010-11, 2011-12 and 2012-13, says: \"Local authorities have preferred to defend services to children, the disabled and the mentally ill. Therefore older people's services have been allocated a significantly reduced portion of the personal social services 'pie' over the last three years.</p> <p>\"Older people increasingly receive [cheaper] domiciliary care than [more expensive] residential or nursing care than in the recent past.</p> <p>It adds: \"The north has been subject to the most aggressive budget cuts, with the north-west faring particularly badly, having had budget reductions of more than 15% for the last two years.</p> <p>\"Over the time period analysed, only one in five [of all] local authorities have increased the elderly care budget, despite demographic pressures increasing the need for care.\"</p> <p>Liz Kendall, the shadow minister for care and older people, said the cuts by councils that were under Labour's control were \"inevitable\", given the scale of budget cuts imposed on them by the coalition.</p> <p>Candesic's analysis also shows as untrue denials by ministers concerning cuts to elderly care services.</p> <p>\"The government has repeatedly denied that funding and services for elderly care are being cut,\" Kendall said. \"Yet this report clearly shows that some of the most vulnerable people in society, in some of the most deprived parts of the country, are bearing the brunt of this government's disastrous policies.\"</p> <p>Michelle Mitchell, Age UK's charity director, said: \"Hidden behind these saddening figures will be many instances of older people living frightened, isolated, lives as they struggle to cope without the care support they need.</p> <p>\"People at the bottom of the income scale are often entirely dependent on local authority care. By cutting spending on social care our society is letting down some of our most vulnerable older people at a time when they need our support the most.\"</p> <p>The Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass) said councils had made \u00a31.89bn of \"savings\" to adult care social services in 2011-12 and 2012-13.</p> <p>But Sarah Pickup, Adass' president, said that about 70% of those savings had come from re-designing how services were delivered, for example via reduced use of residential care and greater use of \"enablement\" services.</p> <p>Last week the Conservative-run Kent county council said it was reducing its adult social care budget next year by \u00a318.8m, amounting to 5% of the total, as part of a package of \u00a360m cuts in its \u00a31.1bn annual budget.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 12 September 2012 to remove figures purporting to show which councils have cut elderly care budgets the most and the least. These figures related to councils' total budgets, not to spending on elderly care. The article was further amended on 18 September 2012 to correct a statement that all the local authorities in England have reduced spending on elderly care. Some have not done so.</p>",

Autumn had come and, with it, the end of a symphony of sport in two majestic movements. But not before a joyous coda, in the form of a celebratory parade, had sealed the memories of all the marvellous deeds of the past six weeks.</p> <p>The bankers got the first glimpse, their ranks of pale blue shirts cramming the streets outside the temples of mammon as the parade of Britain's Olympic and Paralympic athletes set off from in front of the Mansion House, preceded by carnival paper lions and a high-stepping band.</p> <p>Past St Paul's the 21 floats went, where Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympics, is said to have listened closely in 1908 as a preacher advocated the taking part over the winning. Along Fleet Street, down the Strand and into Trafalgar Square, pavements and windows crowded with those thrilled by the sight of the entire dramatis personae, from Adlington to Zara, displaying their precious medals and their very best smiles.</p> <p>All the heroes were present, along with those whose heroism was restricted to the considerable satisfaction of having taken part, every one of them now little lower than the angels in the nation's esteem.</p> <p>Mo Farah, the favourite of all favourites, responded to calls for his famous Mo-Bot until his arms ached. The cheers rang out for Ellie Simmonds and Sir Chris Hoy, Laura Robson and David Weir, Hannah Cockroft and Ben Ainslie, Beth Tweddle and Peter Norfolk, the 51-year-old wheelchair tennis doubles champion.</p> <p>A week earlier Aled Davies, the young Welshman with Paralympic gold and silver medals for discus and shot put around his neck, had looked astonished when 80,000 people roared their welcome as he was introduced on the first morning in the stadium; now he seemed quite accustomed to such unfettered adoration.</p> <p>Only Bradley Wiggins and Andy Murray, both with pressing business elsewhere, were conspicuous by their absence.</p> <p>In Trafalgar Square we thronged at the foot of Lord Nelson's great column, watching events on a big screen as the procession made its way towards us. Few could check another tear as Martine Wright, who lost her legs in the 7/7 atrocities and went on to represent her country in the sitting volleyball competition, struggled to hold back her own emotion during an interview conducted by the retired Olympic runner Iwan Thomas. Thomas hugged his interviewee at the conclusion of their conversation, and never has a rule of journalistic etiquette been more justifiably cast aside.</p> <p>Two hours after setting off, the first of the floats reached the Mall, where the 700 athletes were greeted by a more variegated gathering, dominated by representatives of the volunteers now standing cheek by jowl with the armed forces who had come to the rescue when private enterprise failed to secure the gates of the Games.</p> <p>Weirdly, the biggest cheer of all from those watching on the big screens was reserved for Boris Johnson, glimpsed midway through what seemed to be an attempt to high-five everyone out on the streets of London before taking his place next to David Cameron in the tribune of honour. He is clearly unstoppable now.</p> <p>Perhaps we were given a clue that these Games were going to work in a rather surprising way when something as simple as the countdown to Danny Boyle's opening ceremony turned out to be such a witty and imaginative montage. An event that took its epigraphs from Shakespeare and Stephen Hawking became a festival of art and science as well as sport.</p> <p>There will be no reliable estimate of the number of people who emerged to cheer the athletes and everything they represented. But it was a lot, and they formed a reminder that such large crowds do not usually turn out to cheer for the wrong side \u2013 on behalf of the poll tax, say, or for a morally questionable foreign war.</p> <p>But it is probably best not to invest too much hope for a better world in a mere festival of sport: those Rapier ground-to-air missiles currently being removed from Blackheath Common and Shooters Hill are unlikely to be turned into ploughshares, or racing wheelchairs, any time soon.</p> <p>The parade ended with an air display. There were speeches to come, but no one really needed any more words, even from Boris, as the streamers of red, white and blue smoke from the nine jets of the Red Arrows drifted and dispersed on the south-westerly air currents, blending with the pale grey clouds like a Turner canvas from the National Gallery below.</p> <p>A moment of visual poetry, soon to melt away, unlike the memories that will brighten the bleaker days ahead.</p>",
  "<p>The first elections of police and crime commissioners (PCCs) across England and Wales this November are a Conservative rather than coalition reform initiative. They are to be fought on their traditional territory of \"law and order'' and should yield a much-needed mid-term boost to the party's political fortunes.</p> <p>The roots of directly-elected PCCs lie in the home secretary, Theresa May's early decision to accede to police demands to scrap all Home Office targets for forces, which left no outside mechanism to drive up police performance.</p> <p>The \u00a375m election of the first PCCs for the 41 police forces outside London on salaries of \u00a365,000 to \u00a3100,000 a year is designed to fill this void and sweep away the 50-year-old system of 17-member police authorities deemed weak and ineffective by ministers.</p> <p>When David Cameron launched the hunt for candidates he declared: \"This is a big job for a big local figure. It's a voice for the people, someone to lead the fight against crime, and someone to hold the police to account if they don't deliver ... This isn't just for politicians, but for community leaders and pioneers of all sorts. People with real experience who've done things and run organisations, whether they are charities or companies.\"</p> <p>But those high hopes have not yet been fulfilled. Critics complain that the ranks of ex-Westminster retreads and former police authority chairmen that dominate the lists so far, despite the best efforts of Lord Prescott, are hardly sprinkled with stardust. When this is combined with fears of a low turnout on a wet Thursday in November, serious doubts have been raised about whether the new commissioners will have much more of a mandate than the police authority councillors they'll replace. The Home Office has responded by planning a multi-million pound advertising campaign for October.</p> <p>But this was not how it was supposed to be. The original Conservative plan was to hold the elections in May this year alongside the nationwide council and the London mayoral elections. But an alliance of Liberal Democrats peers and former senior police officers, concerned about the impact of direct party politics on policing, secured the six-month delay.</p> <p>Is it still possible that the election campaign could capture the public imagination? Yes, but it will require some candidates to start making radical waves. Perhaps a Conservative or Labour libertarian will take a stand over the spread of CCTV cameras or another aspect of the database state. Others may make firm commitments not to go down the G4S road. But the room for manoeuvre for such fireworks is severely limited. Any PCC elected on a promise of \"no police cuts\" or to boost police numbers is likely to clash with their local scrutiny panel, which can veto budgets and council tax precept proposals. They may well face the ultimate sanction from the home secretary who can order a local referendum on whether a massive increase in police funding should fall on local council taxpayers.</p> <p>The job itself will be demanding. As the Police Foundation has <a href=\"http://www.police-foundation.org.uk/\" title=\"\">pointed out</a>, the commissioners will not only have the power to hire and fire chief constables, but will also be legally required within weeks to set next year's police force budget as well as publishing a draft policing and crime plan for their force. It will be a sharp learning curve for some successful candidates.</p> <p>They will also take on direct responsibility for distributing the \u00a3100m a year for victim support services as well handing out crime and disorder reduction grants. Ministers even hope PCCs may eventually also have a role in commissioning local probation services.</p> <p>The elections have raised anxieties in the police about their operational independence. These have been reflected in an oath of impartiality each PCC has to swear and new guidance from the Association of Chief Police Officers to protect policing from being dragged into party politics. It bans candidates from making \"fact-finding visits'' to police stations for publicity purposes or even using policing images in their campaign material. Even Lord Prescott's favourite picture of himself astride a Cleveland police Harley Davidson could be caught by the ban.</p>",
  "<p>The British family murdered while on holiday in the French Alps were all shot with a single weapon, according to investigators.</p> <p>Ballistic and forensic experts who have examined the bullet casings at the scene say they were fired from a 7.65mm automatic pistol, a medium calibre that is not as powerful as modern 9mm pistols.</p> <p>Saad al-Hilli, 50, his wife, Iqbal, 47, and her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, were each shot twice to the head in their car at a beauty spot near Lake Annecy, in the Haute Savoie, last Wednesday.</p> <p>Syvain Mollier, 45, a French father of three who appears to have come across the bloodbath while cycling up the mountain path, was shot up to seven times, including twice in the head.</p> <p>The Hillis two daughters were the only survivors. The eldest, Zainab, aged seven, was shot in the shoulder and beaten around the head, leaving her with a fractured skull. She has been brought out of a medically induced coma and police are waiting to interview her.</p> <p>Her sister, Zeena, four, who hid for eight hours in the rear footwell of the family's BMW 5-series estate under the skirt of her dead mother, has been brought back to Britain by carers.</p> <p>Nearly 25 bullet casings were found at the scene. Several were reported to have been discovered in the car, suggesting the gunman had fired at close range, but investigators said all the shots were fired from outside the vehicle.</p> <p>A source close to the inquiry told the Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9 newspaper that detectives were now working on the theory there was one gunman who may have had one or more accomplice.</p> <p>\"There was only one weapon used in the attack on the Hilli family at Chevaline, according to a source close to the inquiry,\" a journalist told the Guardian.</p> <p>\"The weapon used was an automatic pistol of a 7.65mm calibre, a medium calibre considered as old by experts and not corresponding to modern weapons.\"</p> <p>Witnesses including a former RAF pilot who arrived at the scene on a bicycle moments after the killer fled reported seeing a dark-coloured \u2013 possibly green \u2013 4x4 vehicle driving down the narrow winding road away from the scene followed by a motorbike.</p> <p>At the Hilli family home in Claygate, Surrey, detectives called in army bomb disposal experts and evacuated the area for two hours after discovering \"items\" that were later assessed to be non-hazardous.</p> <p>They appeared to be concentrating on items discovered in a workshop in the garden of the mock-Tudor home.</p> <p>James Mathews, a family friend, said the workshop was used by Hilli, an aeronautics engineer, as a draughtsman's office for his design work, and by his wife to study for her dentistry exams.</p> <p>Mathews, 53, a fellow engineer, said he had helped Hilli build the workshop a number of years ago and that inside there were a number of computer servers, large printouts of plans, and four desks. Dismissing claims about hazardous materials, Mathews said: \"Would he keep a explosive materials where his wife worked?\"</p> <p>He said that there was a further office upstairs inside the house and two garages, one of which contained tools and bicycles and the other a mothballed 1950s Mercedes Benz.</p> <p>Mathews said Hilli had worked for Surrey Satellites on an ad-hoc freelance basis, and that when they had spoken on 24 August Hilli had told him he did not know when he would be back working for the company as his latest project had ended.</p> <p>French police have been combing through the caravan in which the family stayed from 3 September until the day of the shooting, which has been removed from the Solitaire du Lac campsite at Saint-Jorioz. They are examining a laptop computer found in the caravan and two mobile phones discovered in the car. They hope CCTV cameras might have captured the killer as they fled the Alpine beauty spot.</p> <p>\"We are looking at all the cameras that might give us some information. We're finding out where they all are, outside shops, banks or even as part of the video protection of communities and we will collect their recordings,\" a gendarme told the Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9.</p> <h2>The weapon</h2> <p>Firearms with a 7.65mm calibre are not as powerful as some modern 9mm pistols and are still fairly prevalent, said Philip Boyce, UK firearms expert for Forensic Scientific.</p> <p>\"It's probably the most famous calibre. There is the old James Bond Walther PPK. You can get very early 1903, 1904 pistols that were made in that calibre. It ranges from back then to now and they are still making them today. It could be quite a modern gun was used,\" he said. \"It's probably a pistol of some sort. There are a lot of manufacturers around the world make them. It's not a low, low calibre. It's still very dangerous.\"</p> <p>Boyce added: \"The fact that there are 25 cartridge cases is interesting. Normally you have between seven and 15 cartridges in a magazine. So the person who did this may have had two magazines, or they have got a special one where they have got an extended magazine, which will take 25 cartridges. Normally you wouldn't expect a pistol of that calibre to have a 25-cartridge capacity magazine.\" <strong>Caroline Davies </strong></p>",
  "<p>Pre-Raphaelite artists were Britain's first modern art movement with rebellious ideas and revolutionary methods way ahead of their time, a major new exhibition at <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-britain\" title=\"\">Tate Britain</a> will argue.</p> <p>The gallery is staging the biggest survey of the group's work since 1984 and aims to dispel once and for all any notion that Pre-Raphaelite art was safe, prudish and 'chocolate box'.</p> <p>One example is John Everett Millais' extraordinary Isabella, which normally hangs in Liverpool. Inspired by a Keats poem, the work is packed with danger and symbols \u2013 \"a Hollywood blockbuster\" of a painting, according to Carol Jacobi, a Tate curator who has studied the painting for a number of years.</p> <p>Jacobi has concluded that the abundance of phallic symbols in the painting \u2013 a stiff thrust of a leg, a nutcracker, a shadow from a groin \u2013 was completely deliberate.</p> <p>The phallic nature of Isabella is not well established; it is sometimes assumed to be little more than furtive schoolboy naughtiness, especially since Millais was 19 when he painted it.</p> <p>Jacobi begs to differ. She points to the white splodge of salt from an overturned salt cellar: Victorian audiences would have known what that was all about because all the medical books warned of the dangers of 'self abuse'. It was not a case of 'you'll go blind', but it would cause you to lose control over your body both literally and psychologically.</p> <p>Given that the character goes on to murder and decapitate Lorenzo \u2013 a man who is falling for his sister \u2013 the analysis begins to make sense. \"It is stunningly innovative, a really effective way of giving us an insight into the character,\" says Jacobi.</p> <p>\"The amazing thing about the Pre-Raphaelites is that it is extreme painting. They use every possible stylistic and pictorial effect to intensify what they are doing, they are interested in finding ways of showing what is going on inside these people's heads.\"</p> <p>Jacobi has written a research paper on the painting, which will be published online by Tate.</p> <p>The true drama of Isabella is just one example of how the artists tried to reinvent painting. The show contains around 180 works by artists including Millais, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Holman Hunt and Ford Madox Brown.</p> <p>The exhibition, which opens to the public on Wednesday, aims to cast fresh light on the Pre-Raphaelites in a number of areas and argues that it was one of the earliest avant-garde art movements, well ahead of the Impressionists and Cubists and Surrealists.</p> <p>It includes a number of significant loans, not least Holman Hunt's Lady of Shalott which has not been seen in the UK since the Festival of Britain in 1951 and has been loaned by the oldest museum in the US, the Wadsworth Atheneum in Connecticut.</p> <p>It is one of the latest Pre-Raphaelite paintings and provides the show's dramatic conclusion. Co-curator Jason Rosenfeld said: \"I always think of this as the Steven Spielberg or Ridley Scott of late 19th-century painting. This painting does everything, it has movement, colour, action and scale \u2013 it feels cinematic and it is meant to blow you away.\"</p> <p>Another is Ford Madox Brown's extraordinary painting Work, which co-curator Tim Barringer called \"one of the greatest paintings of the 19th century. It is a consummate achievement of 19th century realism.\"</p> <p>Barringer said it was a painting that people could easily spend hours looking at and still not understand everything that was going on and, significantly, it is being shown at Tate Britain without glass in front of it.</p> <p>\u2022 Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Avant-Garde 12 September-13 January</p>",

  "<p>I feel bad about this, but I want to say some mean things about Keira Knightley. (Who, when you read her in interviews, seems like a really nice person. There is no quicker way into a British hack's heart, than to <a href=\"www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/aug/30/keiraknightley.periodandhistorical\">tell him repeatedly to fuck off and then drop the c-word</a>. We're that easy.)</p> <p>Knightley, to this extent, is a welcome antithesis to the prissy Hollywood standard. She is also unfairly knocked for being too thin and once <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/jan/22/dailymail.pressandpublishing\">issued libel proceedings against the Daily Mail after it accused her of lying about being anorexic</a>.</p> <p>All of which makes her a good egg, none of which is relevant to how she is on-screen. Usually, those actors who, when you hear they're in a film, lessen the likelihood you'll go and see it, have obnoxious alter egos \u2013 Gwyneth Paltrow's perceived off-screen weediness; Mel Gibson's entire personality \u2013 or are simply too famous as themselves to be credible as someone else, neither of which applies to Knightley. </p> <p>So what is it, on seeing her everywhere right now in posters for the new film adaptation of Anna Karenina, that triggers an instantaneous eye-roll? The film has a good director, Joe Wright, a good supporting cast including the great Olivia Williams and Emily Watson (although, interestingly, Jude Law as the cuckolded husband, is another one the very idea of whom makes one's spirits sink slightly).</p> <p>But it's Knightley who really does for the film, out now in Britain and opening in the US in November. OK, so there's the accent thing: on the evidence of the trailer, she's gone for that campy upper-crust number she did in Atonement (\"come beck; come beck to me\"), aiming for Brief Encounter and <em>ecktually</em> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajC4Az4wscc\">sounding more like the Victoria Wood spoof of it</a>.</p> <p>There's the stricken, owl-eyed, Acting Is Taking Place Here expression she uses in moments of crisis, which always makes me think \"Oh, sit down, love; have a cup of tea; it'll blow over in a minute.\"</p> <p>And, there's no getting around it, there's the jaw thing. This reached its apotheosis in A Dangerous Method, when Knightley, as Sabina, Carl Jung's troubled patient/lover, lead from the jaw with an extraordinary performance it was almost unbearable to watch. (I feel I can say this without risk of being too hideously unkind, because, it goes without saying, a woman of her success, in her profession, is in the top 1% beauty category already. My point is that, in part because of her jaw and the uses she puts it to, you are never in any doubt that you are watching Keira Knightley. It doesn't matter what the role is. Whether she's standing on a beach in Never Let Me Go or under a parasol in Pride and Prejudice. She is always just <em>so Knightley</em>.)</p> <p>Weirdly, the one film she was great in was Pirates of the Caribbean. In a comedy, none of the above matters so much: she was, in that film, vivacious and silly and a much more believable heroine \u2013 something goofy in her makeup clearly aligning with the genre. The same goes for her brief role in the largely terrible Love, Actually. I think Knightley is a comic in dramatic actress's clothing, mostly unsuited to period drama, not least because she looks inescapably modern.</p> <p>Maybe, she'll be wonderful in Anna Karenina, but passing the posters on the subway every day, I tend to think \u2013 never thought I'd hear myself say these words \u2013 wish it was Winslet.</p>",
  "<p>A second person has died from an anthrax infection after injecting heroin, causing health experts to warn hospitals and walk-in clinics across the UK to expect more cases.</p> <p>The death comes three weeks after another heroin user died after contracting the disease from what is assumed to be a batch of contaminated heroin.</p> <p>Both fatalities were in Blackpool but two further cases of infection have been reported in Scotland and Wales since early June.</p> <p>The deaths are part of a European-wide outbreak of anthrax among people who inject drugs: there have been 10 cases across Germany, Denmark and France in recent months.</p> <p>The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction have issued warnings that heroin users in Europe are at risk of exposure to anthrax and warned there may be further cases.</p> <p>\"Anthrax can be cured with antibiotics, if treatment is started early. It is therefore important for medical professionals to know the signs and symptoms to look for, so that there will be no delays in providing treatment,\" said Dr Fortune Ncube, an expert in blood-borne viruses with the Health Protection Agency (HPA).</p> <p>\"It's likely that further cases among people who inject heroin will be identified as part of the ongoing outbreak in EU countries,\" he added. \"The Department of Health has alerted the NHS of the possibility of people who inject drugs presenting to emergency departments and walk-in clinics, with symptoms suggestive of anthrax.\"</p> <p>Local drug services throughout the UK have been alerted and the National Treatment Agency has circulated posters and leaflets about anthrax contamination aimed at heroin users.</p> <p>Drug users may become infected with anthrax when heroin is contaminated with anthrax spores. This could be a source of infection if injected, smoked or snorted.</p> <p>Ncube said there was no safe route for consuming heroin or other drugs that may be contaminated with anthrax spores.</p> <p>\"The HPA is warning people who use heroin that they could be risking anthrax infection,\" he said Ncube. \"We urge all heroin users to seek urgent medical advice if they experience signs of infection such as redness or excessive swelling at or near an injection site, or other symptoms of general illness such a high temperature, chills, severe headaches or breathing difficulties.

  "<p><strong>Marks and Spencer</strong> was among the leading risers in an uncertain market, responding to bid speculation which refuses to die down.</p> <p>A number of reports over the past few weeks have suggested the retailer could be in the sights of private equity groups, and late on Friday there were further suggestions that bankers were working on debt packages to help fund such a deal. Most analysts remain sceptical, but nevertheless the retailer's shares rose 9.9p to 371.1p.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Associated British Foods</strong> fell 26p to \u00a312.80 as its trading update came in below expectations, with another strong performance from Primark outweighed by a \u00a3100m write-off relating to its Australian meat business.</p> <p>Overall the market was fairly calm ahead of what promises to be another busy week for the global economy. Wednesday sees a key Germany decision on the European fiscal treaty and bailout fund, as well as elections in the Netherlands. The following day will see the latest meeting of the US Federal Reserve, with many investors hoping Fed chairman Ben Bernanke will turn on the quantitative easing taps again.</p> <p>In the end the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished virtually unchanged, down just 1.6 points at 5793.2. Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said:</p> <blockquote> The lack of any pressure to the downside indicates that buyers remain in control for the time being but the two major risk events this week, the German legal ruling and the Federal Reserve meeting, could change all that. </blockquote> <p>Mining shares were among the leading risers, with hopes that any Fed move would help boost global demand for commodities. Weak trade data from China also prompted talk that the country might take further measures to stimulate its flagging economy.</p> <p><strong>Kazakhmys</strong> climbed 29p to 686.5p, helped by UBS ugrading its recommendation from sell to buy, while <strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> rose 27.5p to \u00a310.03.</p> <p><strong>Xstrata</strong> added 12.5p to 1026.5p as <strong>Glencore</strong>, down 8.05p at 370p, unveiled its final terms for its proposed merger.</p> <p><strong>BP </strong>was 3.1p better at 437.8p<strong> </strong>after it<strong> </strong>continued its divestment programme by selling $5.55bn worth of Gulf of Mexico assets to US group Plains Exploration.</p> <p>Back with retailers, <strong>Debenhams</strong> dipped 0.4p to 100p after news of another Sale and despite presentations to the City at the end of last week. Analyst Nick Bubb said:</p> <blockquote> Our heart usually sinks when we see yet another Sale brochure from Debenhams drop out of the Sunday supplements and this time Debs are promoting their \"New Season Event\" that kicks off on Tuesday with \"up to 25% off every department\" for 6 days. To be fair, this is actually a week later than last year's similar planed event, but it is noteworthy that analysts were taken around the revamped Milton Keynes store on Friday afternoon before all the Sale posters went up...However, to be ultra-fair again, Debs did give a surprisingly good presentation on Friday on space planning by Mike Goring, the operations veteran, who was clearly a good capture from Arcadia. </blockquote> <p>Lower down the market <strong>UK Coal</strong> added 2.45p to 6.575p after the company said it expected to complete its restructuring by the end of December.</p> <p><strong>Ceres Power</strong> climbed 48% to 11.375p on hopes of a refinancing. The company has said it needs to raise an additional tranche of funding before end of third quarter - that is, the end of September - to continue to meet its planned expenditure. In August - in response to movement in its share price - it said it was continuing to explore its options.</p> <p>A second disappointing well result sent <strong>Chariot Oil &amp; Gas</strong> plunging by 66% to 33p. In May Chariot admitted its first well, at Tapir South, was dry, already raising questions about whether oil would be found at all in the Namibia block.</p> <p>Stuart Joyner at Investec slashed his price target from 318p to just 31p.</p> <p>Finally <strong>Falkland Oil &amp; Gas</strong> fell 23.5p to 67.25p after it revealed drilling operations at its Loligo prospect were five days behind schedule.</p>",

Listen here</a></p> <p><strong>Hometown:</strong> London.</p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Big Shizz, Tempz, Merkz, Kay Willz.</p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> Rascals are four self-styled \"cocky fuckers\" from Bow, east London, original stomping ground of Dizzee Rascal, Wiley, Kano, Tinchy Stryder and Roll Deep. Still only in their late teens, they're already veterans of the grime/hip-hop scenes, having recorded as (Lil) Rascals since they were 12-13 with, variously, Wiley, Tinchy, Roll Deep, Tinie Tempah, Ironik, Sway, Ghetts and N-Dubz. And they've had Twitter support from Wiley, Tinchy and Professor Green. As you can see, the same names keep cropping up when you talk about Rascals. You'd probably imagine, because of their age and earlier tendency to <a href=\"http://theaccompliceltd.com/rascals\" title=\"\">rap about first dates</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CznvRtS-5UQ\" title=\"\">true love</a> and appear in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6YMT7mLLdA&amp;feature=related\" title=\"\">instructional videos about knife crime</a>, that they'd have most in common with N-Dubz. But actually the tracks from their forthcoming mixtape, The Launch Vol 2, are less polished and poppy than that, and instead of catchy R&amp;B choruses you get insistent monotone synth patterns and high, nasal voices that hardly go out of their way to appease.</p> <p>But then, you could have said the same thing about Dizzee, and he was even younger than Rascals when he released Boy in da Corner. He made the public bend to his vision, rather than making music that fulfilled a then-current demand. Rascals, though, aren't really \u2013 or even remotely \u2013 in the same shock-of-the-new league as Dizzee, but at least they're making the right noises. And it is a noise, a series of discordant drones over which their voices buzz like particularly surly flies. On the lead track from the mixtape, Ape Shit, Big Shizz's voice is so whiny and wheedling it makes Pro Green sound like Lee Marvin. It's a one-chord affair with nothing to hook the listener beyond the line, \"Don't be hatin' cos you ain't it.\" And yet it has a certain nagging appeal. What's Going Down features grimy electro sounds and percussive clatter as Shizz asks the titular question, similar to the one posed by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5M_Ttstbgs\" title=\"\">Buffalo Springfield in 1967</a>, although Steve Stills was a terrible rapper and would never have delivered the line, \"You can't be my competition if you're not in my position\", with Shizz's aplomb. There have been mentions in articles of Rascals' swagger, but this is miscreancy lite compared to the generation-defining defilement of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gbJ9kTmJ1Y\" title=\"\">Odd Future</a>.

  "<p>The children's laureate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/julia-donaldson\" title=\"\">Julia Donaldson</a>, author of The Gruffalo, has begged the new secretary of state for culture, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/04/maria-miller-culture-secretary-dcms\" title=\"\">Maria Miller</a>, to step in and protect the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/libraries\" title=\"\">UK's embattled public libraries</a>.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/an-open-letter-from-the-childrens-laureate-julia-donaldson-to-the-new-secretary-of-state-for-culture-8119989.html\" title=\"\">an open letter</a>, published yesterday in the Independent on Sunday, Donaldson pleaded with Miller to take a different course on libraries from her predecessor Jeremy Hunt. About to embark on a six-week tour of the UK's libraries, Donaldson wants to \"draw attention to the erosion of the library service which is happening in so many local authorities, and to the current government's utter refusal to intervene or to provide any leadership\".</p> <p>Donaldson said that nearly 250 libraries are currently either under threat of closure or else have been closed or left council control since April this year, while 2,159 library staff posts, out of a total of 20,924, are set to be cut. Despite this, and despite pleas from campaigners fighting to keep their local branches open, Hunt and the libraries minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/05/library-closures-ed-vaizey\" title=\"\">Ed Vaizey have refused to act</a>, said Donaldson. \"When I met with Ed Vaizey in February and asked him why he had not intervened his reply was, 'Because my advisers didn't advise me to.' Could you, in your new post, please give him some guidance from above?\" she asked Miller.</p> <p>\"Mr Vaizey also told me that he 'did not accept' that there was any problem in the library service. This may be because he is happy with the idea (now a reality in some areas) of libraries being run entirely by volunteers. I am shocked that he could consider this anything more than a short-term measure,\" Donaldson said. \"Of course volunteers have a role to play, and of course it is preferable to have a volunteer-run library than no library, but what I object to is the tendency to dress this trend up as 'vibrant 21st-century thinking', instead of being honest enough to admit that it is a reluctant response to cuts.\"</p> <p>Donaldson asked Miller to consider ring-fencing council spending on children's library services, and to look into the possibility of using some of the education budget for this purpose. \"Above all, will you (unlike your predecessor) respond to concerns and complaints, and show some leadership for our young readers?\" she said. \"If children don't discover what books they like, they are unlikely to become life-long readers, and we are therefore heading for a less literate society. Illiteracy leads to lower skills, greater social problems, higher crime rates, and a country less able to prosper in the global jobs market. So cutting libraries is a false economy. They are the best literacy resource that we have.\"</p> <p>The award-winning children's author <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/alan-gibbons\" title=\"\">Alan Gibbons</a>, another vocal libraries campaigner, has also written to Miller since her appointment last week. \"I&#xa0;note that you have said it is ' \u2026 so important to ensure that books and reading play an important part in children's lives.' I assume that means you will end the damaging actions of your predecessor whose tenure saw library closures and their removal from local authority control, cuts to book funds, reduced opening hours and the sacking of librarians,\" wrote Gibbons. \"I also assume that you will convene at the earliest opportunity a meeting of library users, professional bodies, literacy organisations, authors, librarians' trade unions and other interested bodies to draw up a national plan to promote reading for pleasure. Anything else would surely make those words meaningless.\"</p> <p>On Monday, Miller told BBC Radio 4 that libraries had always been funded by local authorities, not central government.</p>",
  "<p>Here's a question. What is complexity in music? Is there any music more complex than, say, the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2c6AFlb4x4\">six-part Ricercar</a>, with its six independent but symbiotically related strata of ever-changing musical information, from Bach's Musical Offering? Has anyone in the 20th or 21st century come close to demanding as much from his or her listeners and performers than JS Bach did in that piece, or any of his innumerable fugues? Or what about <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW8wdpfkpM0\">Beethoven's late quartets</a>? Aren't they the acme of musical complexity, in the sense of a rich stream of musical meanings and unpredictabilities, for the players just as much as the audience? Or is the bar set still higher by Schoenberg's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgFTLquN8eI\">First Chamber Symphony</a>, that jam-packed single movement that compresses pretty well the entire classical and romantic tradition of forms, structures and expressivity into 20 minutes? Or what about the compressed atonality of Webern's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXE8gPrkRkQ\">early works</a>, or the quasi-neural network of multiple musical connections of his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZq3r0-bLRM\">later music</a>? The impossible canons of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPdX85cv_D8\">Conlon Nancarrow</a>, taking his player pianos to other dimensions in the Mexican desert? Or the vertiginous sound and fury of the postwar avant-garde composers Ligeti, Stockhausen, Boulez, Xenakis \u2026 ?</p> <p>The reason I ask is 69-year-old Coventry-born composer <a href=\"http://toddtarantino.com/hum/ferneyhough.jpg\">Brian Ferneyhough</a>. His works, it is often said, are the <em>ne plus ultra</em> of musical complexity, in the sense of notational overload, performing difficulty and even philosophical questioning. He is even, supposedly, one of the godfathers of \"New Complexity\", although he rejects the term (just like his fellow so-called complexists, James Dillon and Michael Finnissy). Here's a good example of what I'm on about, including, thanks to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/flammesombres?feature=CAQQwRs%3D\">flammesombres</a>'s YouTube channel, a score of Ferneyhough's piano piece <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJwxKxJVps4&amp;feature=related\">Lemma-Icon-Epigram</a> as well as its sounds. (And this is one of Ferneyhough's \"simpler\" scores, by the way.) The comments below include some pretty polarised opinions on this piece, falling into a typical new-music polemic, of \"It sounds like a monkey throwing itself on the keyboard\" versus \"If you don't get this, you're a philistine\". If you're new to this music, though, you may need some help in decoding the score. So let's have a wee think about how you might approach the very first bar. </p> <p>Firstly, the pianist has to play a group of 11 hemi-demi-semiquavers in the time of seven in the basic tempo of quaver = around 50, followed by a single hemi-demi-semiquaver rest and then a semiquaver rest. That volley of notes is followed by a group of 11 hemi-demis in the time of eight, enclosing a triplet and dotted notes; then comes a group where you need to count 10 hemi-demis in your head in the time of eight, but you also have to subdivide them into one group of five against four in your new virtual tempo, and then six against four, before a final hemi-demi rest in that overall scheme of 10 against eight. Got that? And that's just the rhythm. There's then, of course, the small matter of the notes you have to play in this rhythm, the dynamics, and the huge variety of expressive markings and pedal indications. And that's just to be able to get close to playing the first five seconds of this 14-minute piece. It is, well, pretty complex!</p> <p>So what does this kind of notational complexity mean? What does it produce in performance, and what does it sound like? Virtually every single bar of Ferneyhough's music poses these questions (his mature music, at least \u2013 he grew up playing in brass bands in the Midlands, but left what he saw as the UK's musical provincialism for the more experimental climes of Europe and the US, where he now lives and teaches). It's in performance that the open-ended and endlessly fascinating answers are disclosed: philosophical solutions that pile musical riddle on to musical riddle to push at the existential limits of what a musical work might be. </p> <p>Ferneyhough holds no compositorial guillotine of musical perfection over the heads of his performers. Asking any of the musicians who regularly commission and play his pieces \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJVj60z-TVc\">Arditti Quartet</a>, say, or pianist <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0V9ZElkKGak\">Nicolas Hodges</a>, or violinist Mieko Kanno, or cellist Neil Hyde \u2013 to perform them perfectly, according to the precise letter, dot, and micro-indication of his scores, is not Ferneyhough's abiding aim. You see, the desire to put all that information on the page is really the start of a dialogue, with the possibilities of what the performer is going to do with the piece and with what the listeners will hear. Even more fundamentally, the notation is a sort of scratching at the surface of what the actual musical work of Lemma-Icon-Epigram might be. </p> <p>The point is, if Ferneyhough wanted his scores (and check out the orchestral works, such as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxbpF_aW4vU\">La Terre Est un Homme</a> or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mRJipHsiHE\">Transit</a> if you really want your head to spin) to be a sort of straitjacket for the performer, to determine precisely what they should be doing at every micro-second of the piece, he would have become an electronic or electro-acoustic composer. In that case, a single recording could and would represent the definitive realisation of each of his pieces. In fact, as hundreds of composers have discovered in the past, the more information you give for your performers to interpret, the more open-ended rather than fixed the work becomes, as every expressive mark becomes something that's played and interpreted differently by each different performer.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xy8Ozl2AF7o?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xy8Ozl2AF7o\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xy8Ozl2AF7o\">Reading this on mobile?

Perhaps simply this: a dialogue with the composition of which it is a token such that realm of non-equivalence separating the two (where, perhaps, the 'work' might be said to be ultimately located?) be sounded out, articulating the inchoate, outlining the way from the conceptual to the experiential and back.\" I like that, because what Ferneyhough's really saying is that the \"work\" is not to be found only on the printed page (his \"non-equivalence\" phrase), but somewhere between and beyond the sum of the score's indications and the sum of all of the possible performances that may result from it \u2013 as well as being a record of Ferneyhough's own gigantically complex compositional processes.</p> <p>OK \u2013 now bear with this, because these general points will give you a framework at least to begin to understand the rest of Ferneyhough's music, and have something to say about the whole culture of classical music, too. What happens, then, when you hear a piece of Ferneyhough's, in the process of communication from performer to audience? While it's true to say that Ferneyhough does not expect perfection on the part of his performers, he does expect them to try to get there, and part of the thrill of what you hear in any performance of Ferneyhough's music is an experiential extreme of the world's most virtuosic musicians pushing themselves to the boundaries of what they can do \u2013 and sometimes beyond. (At least one of Ferneyhough's pieces, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8Ozl2AF7o\">Time and Motion Study II</a> for solo cello and electronics, makes expressive play with that idea, virtually strapping the cellist into a sort of musical electric chair in which one of the strictures that binds the musician to the attempt to realise the work is the labyrinthine density of the notation, sometimes written on five staves instead of the single stave that a cellist usually needs.) There is no chance \u2013 not even if you're Pierre Boulez or Oliver Knussen \u2013 of notating down what you hear when you hear a Ferneyhough piece. And similarly, there's no chance that the mind-bending rhythmic density of that first bar of Lemma-Icon-Epigram is heard as it is written. Here's what I mean: the effect of that first bar, without the score, is of a coruscating burst of piano sound that propels the start of the musical labyrinth of the piece; it isn't of 10 hemi-demis in the time of eight, or whatever else the score says. So what's the point of all that \"complexity\"?</p> <p>If you talk to the players who most often play Ferneyhough, they all say that his notation has to be the way it is to achieve the results he wants in performance, even if there's a vanishingly tiny possibility of all that information being communicated to the listener. What we're getting as listeners is a trace of the score the performer is playing from, which is in turn only a trace of the musical work that Ferneyhough has imagined. And yet, because of the ferocity of concentration on the part of the musician, and because of the range and imagination of what you hear, what you actually get when you hear a performance of his music is something definitive, direct and undeniable \u2013 a sheer thrill of musical extremity. </p> <p>If you heard the <a href=\"www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/feb/28/brian-ferneyhough-total-immersion-review\">BBC Symphony Orchestra's revelatory performance</a> of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxbpF_aW4vU\">La Terre Est un Homme</a> last February at the Barbican in London, you can't have escaped the elemental power of this music, one of the most significant achievements in late 20th-century orchestral writing, yet hardly known until that concert. (And it must be issued on CD soon, if there's a record company reading this!) </p> <p>All of that is a sort of gigantic upbeat to your own exploration of Ferneyhough's music. Get stuck into his works for solo instruments or chamber ensemble. There's also an unclassifiable music-theatre piece on Walter Benjamin called <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tDheuaUz78\">Shadowtime</a>; there are those gigantically ambitious orchestral pieces, including the most recent, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGUvn_OkSfw\">Pl\u00f6tzlichkeit</a>; and there are some brilliant large ensemble pieces that grab you by the scruff of the neck and don't let go. Try the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCaOfEax8MM\">Carceri d'Invenzione pieces</a>, or one of my favourites, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChUcGzjlnjY\">Terrain</a>, a kind of uber-violin concerto. Oh, and Ferneyhough has also written one of the most important canons of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=775kiGAh5Yg\">string quartets in the entire literature</a>, six of them so far. </p> <p>One last thing: just what is it that Ferneyhough's music has to tell us about the entire literature of western classical music? Well: that it's all essentially unknowable \u2013 it is as difficult to answer the question of what Beethoven's Fifth Symphony really is as what Lemma-Icon-Epigram might be, if you think about it for a second \u2013 and essentially experiential, revealed in all of its elusive but definitive power through the evanescent illumination of performance. In that fundamental sense, Ferneyhough's music is no more and no less complex than any other classical music. Got there.

The picture is then reflected from the side into the centre of the lenses, which are etched with a reflective pattern that then beams the image into the eye.</p> <p>That means the image is directly incorporated into what the wearer see when looking directly ahead \u2013 unlike Google's current incarnation of Google Glass, which puts a small video screen in the bottom right-hand corner of the right eye. That requires the wearer to look down to focus on it, taking their attention away from the view ahead.</p> <p>Unlike the present Google Glass implementation, where it is obvious that the user is looking into a screen in the corner of their glasses \u2013 both because it is visible and because their eye direction changes \u2013 the TTP system is invisible to anyone watching, and doesn't require a change of gaze by the wearer.</p> <p>Though the TTP glasses are only a proof of concept, its engineers believe the idea could be taken up by larger businesses that are interested in developing systems incorporating augmented reality. Though it declined to give any names, it is understood to be talking to at least one California-based company about applications of its technology.</p> <p>\"We would talk to all the big players,\" says Dr Allan Carmichael, business development manager at TTP. \"We would tell them that we have a solution, and we would aim to persuade them that this can be used in practice.\" TTP would then license the technology to companies that were interested; TTP is not, Carmichael emphasises, a manufacturing company in its own right.</p> <p>\"Sports and leisure use are obvious applications,\" said Roger Clarke, TTP's project manager for augmented reality technologies. \"For sports, you could show information like your heart or breathing rate; a simple display with relevant information is where this technology is headed. Then after that is proven you can move on to larger displays with more tailoring and information.\"</p> <p>Carmichael thinks that the \"killer app\" for an augmented reality system might be one that would work when you look under your car bonnet, \"so rather than seeing a big block, you see it all clearly labelled to tell you what part is what\". Alternatively, he suggests, surgeons might find it useful, \"not to show them what they're looking at, because it's never actually that clear, but to tell them what's happening to the patient's life signs: \u2013 to the blood oxygenation when I press here, what happens to the pulse. If you can display that directly into their field of vision, that's really useful.\"</p> <p>At present the system is only able to display a still image in monochrome. But engineers at TTP are confident that, as interest in AR-based systems grows, companies will be able to make tiny video projectors that can be incorporated into the arms of spectacles.</p> <p>Google's Glass project aims to produce systems built into ordinary-looking spectacles that would overlay information about a location, or from the user's internet feeds, into their visual field. A <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/apr/05/google-project-glass-digital-goggles\" title=\"\">concept film</a> released in April suggested that one day systems which could react to location and to what was seen by the wearer would become commonplace.</p> <p>\"Google has done a remarkable job of getting the world to alight on the idea of augmented reality,\" says Carmichael. But he feels that the next step need to be to improve both the appearance of the system to the user and to other people. \"It's about creating desirability and elegance in how it appears,\" he says.</p> <p>Clarke says that sports glasses, because they tend to be large, offer the best option. Recon Instruments already offers ski goggles which have a built-in video projector like Google Glass, but those too are limited to a non-central point.</p> <p>In the TTP prototype, the present projector technology offers VGA, or 640x480 pixel, resolution. \"We can get a video attachment in a few weeks,\" he told the Guardian.</p> <p>The team has also devised a passive system by which the user can control the device, or an attached computer, just by moving their eyes to the left or right. Rather than using eye-tracking systems, which demand a camera watching the pupils and which Clarke says are \"relatively computationally expensive\", it uses passive electrodes mounted on the glasses that monitor activity in the muscles at the side of the temple - which produce particular signals that are indicative of eye movement.</p> <p>He thinks that head-mounted displays could have been commonplace now, but that in the 1990s companies making displays decided not to focus on miniaturisation, and instead aimed for bigger products, principally seen in large screen TVs. \"Sony and Sharp bet that people would want smaller displays. That turned out to be the wrong bet then. If things had gone differently then we would already have very high-quality tiny displays today.\"</p> <p>Carmichael is confident that, in time, heads-up displays using glasses such as TTP is demonstrating will go from the realm of experiment to become commonplace. \"If you had told people in 2002 that they could have their email on their phone, they would have said 'why would I want that?',\" he says. \"Getting micro-displays is still a big challenge, but the lenses are getting better all the time.\" In time, he adds, we might find that such glasses are ideal for something that we barely do at present \u2013 such as watching video while on the move.</p>",
  "<p>September 11, 2001 is a milestone date in history that nearly everyone living at the time will recall in detail for the rest of their lives. I will always remember sitting at my desk in my office at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama, eyes fixed on the television in the credenza sitting on the other side of the room. I recall watching the towers fall and wondering how it would change America.</p> <p>Like this 10 September, 10 September 2001 was a Monday. The only reason I know that is because it was the day before an enormous tragedy that is permanently etched into my mind, and that happened on a Tuesday. I went to the same office and sat at the same desk on Monday as I did on Tuesday, but I have no recollection of one day and a vivid recollection of the other. Even though I do not recall any of the details of Monday 10 September, sometimes I think about how America might be different if we could turn back the clock.</p> <p>On 10 September, the US economy was strong, although it had begun to slow down after a sustained period of growth. The unemployment rate stood at 4.9%. We were paying down the national debt and there was a $127bn surplus for the fiscal year ending on 30 September. For some, concern about the nation's debt focused on what might happen in a few years when the debt was completely eliminated and there was no longer a need for US treasuries, a key component in the world's economy.</p> <p>Worries about the consequences of a debt-free America evaporated soon thereafter. After tax cuts, two unfunded wars, and a near-collapse of the economy, US treasury department figures show the nation's debt grew from less than $6tn in 2001 to nearly $16tn today. The <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> reports the unemployment rate has remained over 8% throughout 2012 after peaking at 10% in October 2009.</p> <p>Rightly or wrongly, on 10 September 2001, most Americans believed their phone calls and emails were private and did not suspect that the <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/01/fbi-att-verizon-violated-wiretapping-laws/\">government might be listening in</a> and keeping tabs. If <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/nov/17/tsa-patdowns-scanner\">someone fondled your junk at the airport</a>, you would expect to see the person again, this time as you sat on the witness standing testifying in his or her sexual assault trial. If the government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/nov/23/human-rights-us-constitution-and-civil-liberties\">was going to execute a citizen</a>, it was assumed that followed after a trial and appeals in the courts of our judicial system, not a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/10/targeted-killing-flexibility-doctrine-flout-law-war\">unilateral decision by a president that is immune from any review</a>.</p> <p>Back then, our most recent recollection of war was Desert Storm, a six-week campaign that ousted Saddam Hussein from Kuwait with fewer than 150 US military personnel killed in action. We watched on television as members of the Iraqi armed forces put down their weapons and surrendered by the tens of thousands, something they did in part because they trusted United States military personnel would provide them food, shelter, medical care and humane treatment.</p> <p>Now, after more than a decade of non-stop war, in which only a small percentage of Americans have ever had any skin in the game, the public seems to pay little attention to the thousands of Americans who have died, the tens of thousands who have been injured, or the hundreds of billions of dollars spent overseas.</p> <p>Public opinion of the United States tends to vary sharply among people in different countries, but one common trend is that America's reputation has declined across the board over the past dozen years, even among America's closest allies. A <a href=\"http://pewresearch.org/\">Pew Research Center</a> report in 2000 showed the US had an 83% favorable rating in Great Britain. Today, it stands at 60%, up a bit from 53% in 2008. In Germany, the US favorability rating fell from 78% in 2000 to a low of 31% in 2008.</p> <p>America has taken some of the shine off of that \"shining city on a hill\" Ronald Reagan described as the envy of the world.</p> <p>Attitudes of the American public have changed significantly, too. A poll conducted by the Christian Science Monitor in November 2001 showed that two-thirds of Americans were opposed to torture. A survey conduct by the American Red Cross in 2011 showed that a majority of Americans, including nearly six in 10 teenagers, <em>approved</em> of using torture. Perceptions of what is right and wrong changed when fear took hold in the Home of the Brave.</p> <p>There is ample room for debate about how and why America got to where it is today, but as election day approaches on 6 November, Americans need to ask themselves about the direction they want the nation to move in the years ahead. Do they want the future to be more like the America that existed on 10 September 2001 or are they satisfied with the America that emerged after 11 September?</p> <p>Is America better-off now than it was 11 years ago?</p>",
  "<p>From the outside, modelling looks glamorous and fun \u2013 beautiful people in beautiful places wearing beautiful clothes \u2013 what could be better? I have been modelling for 13 years and don't regret a single minute.</p> <p>But the glamour is only part of the story. There is a hidden world in which models are not treated with respect and not treated as deserving of proper working conditions and consideration. It is to change that part of the modelling world that I got involved with my trade union Equity and it is to help models take greater control of their working lives that I am speaking at the <a href=\"http://www.equity.org.uk/news-and-events/events/equity-tuc-congress-2012-434/\" title=\"\">Trades Union Congress (TUC) conference on Tuesday</a>.</p> <p>So what am I talking about? What can turn a model's working life from glamour to something closer to a nightmare?</p> <p>Two years ago I was on an outdoor shoot in the UK during the autumn, modelling clothes for next year's summer season.</p> <p>As the day went on I got colder and colder, but strangely after eight hours I started to feel fine. I learnt afterwards that, as oxygen drains from the head, this sense of calm is one of the early signs of hypothermia. After nine hours I lost consciousness. Hypothermia is serious and at the most extreme it can kill, but not only were there no thermal blankets to keep me warm when I was not being photographed, after coming round I was not taken to hospital but put in a taxi and sent home. I was ill for a week and docked pay because I could not do the second day of shooting.</p> <p>I am not saying I was intentionally put in harm's way, it is simply that I was not seen as a worker deserving of the normal amounts of care and respect.</p> <p>Privacy is also important. Models have to change clothes rapidly at both catwalk shows and photoshoots. Too often the changing areas are semi-public \u2013 almost anybody can walk in. The attitude seems to be \"they're models \u2013 they are used to it and don't mind,\" but I do mind \u2013 it is my body and I want the right to chose who sees me semi-clothed or naked.</p> <p>Then there is the seedier side of modelling \u2013 models being taken to a shoot, usually oversees, and then expected to escort rich men to restaurants and casinos at night. The acceptance in some parts of the industry that this is normal is wrong and puts models at risk.</p> <p>So what do we want to happen? Through Equity models have developed a <a href=\"http://www.equity.org.uk/news-and-events/equity-news/equity-at-london-fashion-week/\" title=\"\">code of conduct</a> setting down basic standards of decency. We are calling on all major high-street clothes chains to sign up so that the models they employ to show off their clothes can be protected.</p> <p>The code covers working hours and breaks, provision of meals, travel and transport, respect and dignity, change of appearance, nudity and semi-nudity, changing areas and bathroom facilities, temperature, insurance, prompt payment and use of models under 16 years of age. If the code is supported, the first-time models will get a guarantee of decent treatment.</p> <p>Since Equity started representing models, things have got better. For example, in the past couple of years I have almost always had proper access to food while working. This is a new and very welcome development.</p> <p>Equity is working closely with the <a href=\"http://www.equity.org.uk/news-and-events/equity-news/equity-and-fashion-industry-promotes/\" title=\"\">British Fashion Council</a> and the Association of Model Agencies, and at last the fashion industry has started to take notice.</p>",
  "<p>The meeting of <a href=\"http://fight2saveancoatsdispensary.wordpress.com/\">'Fight 2 Save Ancoats Dispensary'</a> kicks into gear with everyone in a full room introducing themselves in turn. Last up we have Gillian:</p> <blockquote> <p>I'm Gillian. I'm the campaign secretary. And I'm quite annoyed.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>This raises a smile; everyone here is more than annoyed. The room is filled with people of all ages and backgrounds who are very angry. Angry and passionate about preserving the Grade II listed building in East Manchester. Ardwick and Ancoats Dispensary, once a beautiful redbrick Gothic temple to public health but <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/jul/10/manchester-historic-building-campaign/print\">now facing demolition</a>. Manchester city council's planning and highways committee has signed what councillors believe will be the Dispensary's death warrant. </p> <p>In the three months since the campaign started action has snowballed, helped by local and national reporting as well as the goodwill and time of local residents turned activists. Opposition to the demolition has taken on a physical form. Every day volunteers stand vigil, hundreds of <a href=\"http://www.petitiononline.co.uk/petition/save-ancoats-dispensary/3320\">protest signatures </a>have become thousands, pedestrians offer their support and cars honk their horns as they drive down Old Mill Street. </p> <p>Let's face it, there is plenty to be annoyed about. The Dispensary was bought by Urban Splash in 2001 as part of lofty plans to <a href=\"http://www.newislington.co.uk/\">redevelop Ancoats </a>as New Islington. This scheme was trumpeted as a bold initiative to transform the city and a model of consultation. Former residents don't quite remember it that way. Urban Splash director Tom Bloxham said at the time:</p> <blockquote> <p>We've got the skills... we've got the energy to make this deliver. </p> </blockquote> <p><br>Yet through all this, nothing progressed for the Dispensary. It was neglected in the heady years of the property bubble, then slated for demolition in the subsequent crash. It turns out that skills and energy aren't enough, you need the money and the will too. </p> <p>It seems that Urban Splash expected a heritage equivalent of the bank bailouts to deal with their neglect. By the time it became clear that this would fail to materialise, the damage had gone from bad to appalling. Even moves to maintain the Dispensary have hastened its decline: the removal of the roof has exposed the fabric of the building to the elements and the state of things is now being used as a justification for demolition. </p> <p>Apparently \"the roof and floors were removed to facilitate repairs.\".If this is repair, remind me never to get Tom Bloxham round to do DIY.</p> <p>The story now is that everything is out of the control of the council and developer. Nothing can be done, as the damage is too far advanced; it would be far too expensive for Urban Splash. Of course this conveniently ignores the decade in which the owners failed to live up to their responsibilities while Manchester's Labour council failed to use the powers available to force Urban Splash to act. </p> <p>However, even in the face of the damage done, all is not lost. A significant funding gap needs to be closed, but the building is not beyond saving. Money is needed, but even more important is pressure and a will to save the place. The campaigners, for all their grassroots activism are not ignoring practicality; they are also getting legal advice, something that tends to concentrate minds on an issue.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395962844\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/10/5/1317830905591/free-schools-002.jpg\" alt=\"free schools\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Free schools such as Batley Grammar in West Yorkshire; will they last?  Photograph: Christopher Thomond</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CHRISTOPHER THOMOND/Guardian./Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What's enraging them is that Urban Splash continue to press ahead with other schemes in the area as if nothing has happened. The firm is are part of the bid for <a href=\"http://www.newislingtonschool.com/\">New Islington Free School</a>, which has now been accepted by the Department of Education. While an old hospital is left to fall, we are expected to believe that they can raise a school? </p> <p>If that sounds a bit hypothetical, look at it like this; the financing to save the Dispensary's fabric was supposed to be covered by the North West Development Agency, which <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10385430\">fell victim </a>to the change in government. Isn't the free school programme <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/sep/03/free-school-primary-places-labour\">just as vulnerable </a>to new fads in Westminster? </p> <p>The Dispensary campaign is about more than just the potential loss of something rare and beautiful, it is about how communities in much of the north of England have been treated. We're all too acutely aware of how the cuts are biting, and how the promised regeneration has failed to change the prospects for so many. This building housed the first orthopedic department in the world, it housed the city's first X-ray department. It is a monument to social advance, yet apparently the council and developers are prepared to dump it on the scrap heap. This seems to be becoming a regular feature of our society - just across the road, the NHS walk-in centre is <a href=\"http://menmedia.co.uk/northeastmanchesteradvertiser/news/s/1580884_reprieve-for-ancoats-walk-in-centre-facing-axe\">now threatened</a> with closure.</p> <p>The Dispensary is the last remnant of a city that has been all but swept away; the vision of transforming the Cardroom estate that started this chain reaction simply hasn't<a href=\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2007/feb/24/architecture\"> lived up to the hype</a>. Back in 2007 it was said that the development was to by complete by 2012 and was to be \"the most ambitious regeneration project in the world\". </p> <p>We all want to see improvements to our city and our lives, but the Dispensary is a link with the past that is also a potent reminder that developer's PR froth is just that. To lose the building would be a signal that no responsibility needs to be taken, that some people can just walk away. As one woman puts it bluntly in the meeting, \"it was an experiment in social cleansing\". </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395962845\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/10/1347287001914/loz.jpg\" alt=\"loz kaye\" width=\"140\" height=\"121\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Loz Kaye</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her words keep replaying in my mind as I walk home from the meeting.

  "<p>We should welcome the news that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/10/taliban-accept-us-presence-afghanistan\" title=\"\">Taliban are reportedly open to the idea of negotiating a general ceasefire and even a peace settlement</a>. The peace process in Afghanistan is at risk from spoilers on all sides and fraught with challenges. But we owe it to the Afghan people, and to all those who have suffered in the conflict, to give it a try.</p> <p>It would be a grave mistake to assume the Taliban would only settle for absolute power. Taliban leaders know they stand no chance of seizing power now or in the near future. They know that even coming close would reinvigorate and potentially augment the coalition of forces ranged against them. That could trigger a civil war, which they are anxious to avoid. Even if they could seize power, they would be pounded by drones, ostracised and dependent on Pakistan. The leadership craves the opposite: safety, recognition and independence.</p> <p>The Taliban <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11451718\" title=\"\">rose to power in the 1990s</a>, promising to bring order in place of turmoil. But since 2001, the expectations of ordinary Afghans have changed. They not only want order and justice but reliable public services, basic freedoms and a say over their own affairs. Antediluvian theocracy has had its day, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talib\" title=\"\">thinking Talibs</a> know it.</p> <p>The Arab awakening has not gone unheeded. A Taliban think-piece leaked last year asked what kind of elections they should support and how the government should meet the people's needs. They yearn to be taken seriously as a credible, national political force.</p> <p>The Taliban remain powerful in much of the country. But they have suffered big losses and are facing pressure, even armed resistance, from communities in provinces such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghazni\" title=\"\">Ghazni</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laghman_Province\" title=\"\">Laghman</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nangarhar_Province\" title=\"\">Nangahar</a>. The cohesion and discipline of the movement is under strain. And while the impending withdrawal of foreign forces will allow the Taliban to claim some sort of success, it also removes the movement's biggest single motivating force.</p> <p>In addition to this, most Taliban leaders deeply resent their dependence on, and manipulation by, Pakistan's intelligence agency, the ISI. Having spent a decade or more in Pakistan, from where they run the insurgency, they hope to return in safety to their homeland.</p> <p>The justification for military action against the Taliban in 2001 was the movement's sheltering of al-Qaida. Today, most of al-Qaida's leaders live in Pakistan, and <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iJfrBY1l-orXg0sCVo3BN67KhGgQ?docId=CNG.451251fe7d45665810783145af316fdc.2f1\" title=\"\">most analysts see the Taliban's relationship with al-Qaida as fragile and insubstantial</a>.</p> <p>Last month Mullah Omar, the Taliban leader, said: \"The Islamic emirate of Afghanistan wants good relations and mutual interactions with the world \u2026 [and] assures all the world that it will not allow anyone to use the soil of Afghanistan against any one.\" Or simply, we won't shelter al-Qaida again. We might not take his word for it, but it suggests there's a basis for discussion.</p> <p>The Taliban are not monolithic; its fighters have varied motivations. Many fight because they believe the US seeks to conquer Afghanistan and subvert its religion or culture. Some are driven by the predation and degeneracy of the Afghan government and its warlord allies. Still others fight for personal, local or tribal reasons.</p> <p>There are undoubtedly extreme elements within the movement. The Haqqani group, responsible for some of the most gruesome attacks in Kabul, is due to be designated a foreign terrorist organisation by the US.</p> <p>The aggressive campaign of air strikes and night raids initiated by General Petraeus all but wiped out a generation of moderate insurgent commanders. But the fanatics are still a minority.</p> <p>Broadly the Taliban want the withdrawal of foreign forces, a share of power and the implementation of sharia law. They probably seek a major role in justice and anti-corruption, and influence in social, religious and educational affairs. But what exactly their demands are, and whether they are compatible with human rights or the aspirations of the Afghan people, is impossible to say until a genuine dialogue is under way.</p> <p>The new <a href=\"http://www.rusi.org/downloads/assets/Taliban_Perspectives_on_Reconciliation.pdf\" title=\"\">study</a> by the Royal United Services Institute suggests the Taliban might even accept a ceasefire and the presence of US forces in a peacekeeping capacity. There are a range of interpretations of sharia within the movement. It may be that the Taliban's position on issues such as the constitution or girls' education is not as radical or inflexible as we fear.</p> <p>Indeed, comparative studies show that insurgent or paramilitary groups tend to overstate their demands for propaganda purposes and to bolster morale, and that their goals often diminish over time, as with the Palestinian Liberation Organisation or Colombia's National Liberation Army.</p> <p>Talks could help to break down some of the misapprehensions that have inflamed the conflict. As&#xa0;in many other insurgencies, talks might also help to reduce the frequency or intensity of violence. In the absence of talks there is little reason to expect anything other than protracted conflict. There may even be an escalation of violence as the Taliban and other power-holders vie to occupy the space created by Nato's hurried departure. And given the deficiencies of Afghan national security forces, we should expect expansion of Taliban control in the rural south, south-east and west. All this explains why all polls and field research indicate that a clear majority of Afghans, both men and women, favour talks.</p> <p>It is hard to believe that seven years since major hostilities began there is still no substantive, regular dialogue between the principal parties.</p> <p>Last year's progress has stalled due to differences over terms and preconditions relating to the establishment of a Taliban office, a US-Taliban prisoner exchange, and the opening of formal talks. Especially problematic is the Taliban's willingness to talk to the US first, and only later to the Afghan government.</p> <p>The priority should be to open substantive, multiparty talks without preconditions.</p> <p>But as the troops and aid flows recede, so does the international community's ability to influence the parties, establish a peace process and protect the gains made since 2001. The involvement of agreed mediators or facilitators, currently absent, could help to unblock talks.</p> <p>No channel can succeed without Pakistan's support. Whether or not Pakistan has a seat at the table, its officials should ultimately be involved in talks. And as the dialogue strengthens, it should expand to involve northern and central Afghan political factions.</p> <p>It should be supplemented by a broader reconciliation process involving representatives of all parts of Afghan society. Any future peace, whether achieved through a single settlement or patchwork of understandings, will only be sustainable if it reflects the aspirations of ordinary Afghans.</p>",

  "<p>My friend Gabriel Hardisty-Miller, who has died of a progressive neurological condition aged 25, changed how people think about disability and defied the usual preconceptions and expectations of a non-verbal person with autism. He never let his autism, or the further challenges of epilepsy, stop him from meeting people and going places.</p> <p>Gabriel inspired the politicians who met him and was at the forefront of campaigning for the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/15/contents\" title=\"Autism Act 2009\">Autism Act 2009</a>, the first disability-specific law in England. He shared his story of living with autism, lobbied politicians and became one of the faces for the Think Differently About Autism campaign organised by the <a href=\"http://www.autism.org.uk/\" title=\"National Autistic Society\">National Autistic Society</a> (NAS), using his Yes-No communication device to get his point across.</p> <p>Together, we ran a successful music and cultural club night called PigPen in Hoxton, east London. Gabriel had an ear for the best music, poetry and performance. Many of the acts he chose for PigPen with a definite \"Yes, Yes\" early in their career are now finding success.</p> <p>Gabriel was born in Leytonstone, east London, to the artist Graeme Miller and Beth Hardisty. When he was four, his parents separated and a year later his father met and married the artist Mary Lemley. Gabriel moved with his father and stepmother to Shoreditch, east London. We met in 2006 when I applied for the advertised position of mentor and PA for a young man with autism. By then Gabriel was living with his stepmother, and she was committed to Gabriel having a life like any other 19-year-old. She used the money she had put aside for a new kitchen to hire me instead.</p> <p>PigPen evolved through my working with Gabriel and our shared love of music. In 2008 we also wrote a blog for the NAS's <a href=\"http://www.autism.org.uk/get-involved/campaign-for-change/our-campaigns/i-exist.aspx\" title=\"I Exist campaign\">I Exist campaign</a> \u2013 developing our own style through text and illustrations. It was through this blog that we were invited by the society to attend the House of Commons for the introduction of the white paper for the Autism bill in 2008. It was then that Gabriel realised he could benefit others like him through campaigning for awareness of those with autism.</p> <p>As one of his friends said: \"With his beauty, sense of style, wit and uncompromising attitude which set the bar high, Gabriel left a deep impression on all those who met him.\"</p> <p>He is survived by Graeme, Beth and Mary and his grandfather Norman.</p>",

But I'm very happy to return and find business as usual in British crosswording, where coalition policies are still clued with casual disdain, as in Picaroon's clue in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/prize/25730\">the Guardian prize puzzle</a>...</p> <blockquote> <p>20ac <strong>Notion Tory created</strong> by egoistic <em>fiddling</em> (3,7)</p> </blockquote> <p>...for BIG SOCIETY, the policy cluster relaunched so often that it risked Cameron's party being labelled One-Notion Conservatives. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2012/sep/07/prize-crossword-annotated-solution-25730\">The annotated solution is now available</a>, kicking off with a winning all-in-one clue...</p> <blockquote> <p>1ac <strong>Red with feelings <em>stirred up</em> <em>about</em> possessing wealth</strong> (9,6)</p> </blockquote> <p>...for FRIEDRICH ENGELS.</p> <h2>Blue clues</h2> <p>Likewise, at the Telegraph Toughie, the odd smattering of smut was still present and correct, as with <a href=\"http://puzzles.telegraph.co.uk/site/search_puzzle_number?id=17643\">Beam's suggestive surface reading</a>...</p> <blockquote> <p>17d Young man's <em>gripping</em> extravagant <em>upturned</em> <strong>rump</strong> (8)</p> </blockquote> <p>...matched by the equally gluteal answer BUTTOCKS.</p> <h2>Latter patter</h2> <p>However, it was a mild surprise to find a term for a hardcore underground feminist movement in the Times. <a href=\"https://www.crosswordclub.co.uk/puzzle/crossword/30a26c963542eb0a013967474fa3028b/print_solution/3\">Wednesday's puzzle</a> asked for...</p> <blockquote> <p>9ac <strong>Female punk</strong> trilogy <em>(abridged), strangely</em> <em>covering</em> basic subjects? (4,5)</p> </blockquote> <p>The dictionaries offer RIOT GIRL and RIOT GRRL as alternative spellings but the answer here, via the three Rs, is the title of the 1991 mini-zine RIOT GRRRL. With <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/07/pussy-riot-benefit-concert-st-petersburg\">Sunday's Pussy Riot benefit gig in St Petersburg</a>, it's practically a topical clue and anyone interested in the background should go immediately to the wonderful <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780571241347\">33 Revolutions Per Minute</a> by this parish's Dorian Lynskey.</p> <p>There was another relatively recent coinage in <a href=\"http://puzzles.telegraph.co.uk/site/search_puzzle_number?id=17644\">Friday's Telegraph Toughie</a>...</p> <blockquote> <p>17ac <strong>Unreliable patch</strong> results when arbitrator<em>'s lead is replaced by</em> two successors (6)</p> </blockquote> <p>...where you replace the J of JUDGE with its alphabetic successors to get programmers' term for a bodged bit of code, KLUDGE.</p> <p>Since the setter Notabilis is a software engineer and I'm not, I'm not going to query his definition, but it's perhaps worth noting that for some coders, there's occasional pride in finding a fast solution that shouldn't work but does, also sometimes referred to as a KLUDGE.</p> <p>The etymology of KLUDGE is an intricate and confusing whodunnit with suspects including the Scottish term for a communal toilet CLUDGIE, backronyms like Klutzy, Lame, Ugly, Dumb, but Good Enough and the Kluge paper feeder used in printing.</p> <p>There's also an apparent source in naval slang, which appears always to muddy the etymological waters, as with an antecedent of KLUDGE which is apparently unrelated both to <a href=\"http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=19960711\">the legal sense of rigging a jury</a> and to <a href=\"http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/211600.html\">the near-soundalike JERRY-BUILT</a>. It might or might not come from the Latin <em>adjutare</em> (to aid) and is probably unrelated to INJURY but the question here, reader, is: how would you clue JURY-RIGGED?</p> <h2>Themes and tricks</h2> <p>More because-they-can engineering in the Independent this week, including Monk's hidden Queen tribute on Monday, where MERCURY, BOHEMIAN and RHAPSODY appeared in the non-crossing squares and a deft trick from Phi on Friday. His across answers included, in this order: COMPONENT, ABALONES, KNOTWORK, THREE-PLY, FIVEFOLD, EIGHTY, THIRTEEN and TWENTY-ONE. The numbers included in that sequence meant that the mathematician at two down...</p> <blockquote> <p>2d Unreliable statement supported by account supplied by one <strong>mathematician</strong> (9)</p> </blockquote> <p>...could only be Leonardo FIBONACCI. </p> <h2>Clue of the week</h2> <p>Once you realised that Tyrus's 20 down was WALLACE and his 28 across MASTERCHEF, the ingredients of his apposite anagram...</p> <blockquote> <p>8d/14d/5d \"Doing egg on toast... the kitchen's hot...\" You are <em>talking</em> <em>rubbish</em>! <strong>(as 20 in 28)</strong> (7,6,3,7,4,4)</p> </blockquote> <p>...fell into place: COOKING DOESN'T GET TOUGHER THAN THIS. A clue that, when you get it, you might say DENOTES SHATTERING THOUGHT.</p> <h2>Cluing competition</h2> <p>Thanks for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/aug/20/crossword-roundup-ruperts-return?commentpage=all\">your clues for MONTEZUMA'S REVENGE</a> and I'm especially grateful to all those who found tactful means of referring to the intestinal dysfunction concerned, notably Insidian's \"Trots into card game on Jacob's flagship\", phitonelly's \"Government maze use confused Mexican evacuation\" and CasusPacis's \"Nervous Aztec men caught out, say, by Mexican starter in liquid lunch\".</p> <p>The runner-up is harlobarlo's allusive \"Mexican leader's vindictiveness makes it difficult for one to come out of the closet\" and the winner for its concision and smooth surface is Qfwfq73's \"Bad menu with ersatz veg, omen of Delhi-belly\".

  "<p>Scottish fish farmers have been forced to use record amounts of highly toxic pesticides to combat underwater parasites that prey on salmon, raising fears of significant damage to the marine environment.</p> <p>Data released by the <a href=\"http://www.sepa.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Scottish Environment Protection Agency</a> (Sepa) shows a 110% increase in the use of chemicals to treat sea lice in the past four years, mainly because the parasite is becoming resistant to treatment. During that same period, however, salmon production has increased only by 22%, to 158,000 tonnes.</p> <p>The agency said it was not carrying out any studies into the impact of the chemicals on the marine environment, but added that there was no evidence of any cumulative damage from increasing use of pesticides.</p> <p>Richard Dixon, director of the environment group WWF Scotland and a Sepa board member, said the figures were worrying. The Scottish government and salmon industry plan to <a href=\"http://www.scottishsalmon.co.uk/facts_figures/index.aspx\" title=\"\">increase output by 50% by 2020</a>, suggesting that there will be even greater use of toxic treatments against sea lice in&#xa0;future.</p> <p>Urging the industry to cut chemical use, Dixon said: \"News that the use of some pesticides has jumped in recent years is a worry and urgently needs addressing. It is doubly concerning as the industry is still in the process of expanding. Expansion of the industry should be predicated on the reduction in chemicals released.\"</p> <p>Don Staniford, a campaigner who was given the data by Sepa, and who has previously been deported from Canada for his activities against its fish farming industry, said he believed the increase breached the UK's legal duties to protect the marine environment. \"Instead of reducing chemical use, Sepa has shamefully sanctioned a doubling in the use of toxic chemicals which are known to kill lobsters and other shellfish,\" he said.</p> <p>The chemicals used are highly toxic to many marine species, especially crustaceans. The treatments use organophosphates, which attack the nervous system of sea lice and<a href=\"http://apps.sepa.org.uk/spripa/Pages/SubstanceInformation.aspx?pid=173\" title=\"\"> teflubenzuron</a>, which interferes with their ability to grow shells. Marine scientists have shown the chemical is extremely threatening to young lobsters, crabs and prawns, Staniford said.</p> <p>The salmon industry is expected to keep use of the toxins under strict control but has seen significant problems in Norway with the emergence of \"superlice\" resistant to normal treatments.</p> <p>Ecologists and campaigners argue there is compelling evidence that some fish farms are failing to use chemicals safely. Sepa disclosed last week that while a large majority were satisfactory or excellent, <a href=\"http://www.sepa.org.uk/about_us/what_we_do/compliance_assessment/2010_assessment_reports.aspx\" title=\"\">54 fish farms were rated as \"poor\" in 2011</a> \u2013 mostly for having too high chemical residues on the seabed, an increase on the <a href=\"http://www.sepa.org.uk/about_us/what_we_do/compliance_assessment/2011_assessment_reports.aspx\" title=\"\">51 found to be poor or very poor in 2010</a>.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.salmon-trout.org/fish_farming.asp\" title=\"\">Salmon and Trout Association</a>, which represents anglers, said last week that its analysis of Sepa's seabed monitoring reports identified 137 cases since 2009 where salmon farms' environmental impact had been \"unsatisfactory\", with 64 rated as \"borderline\". It said other freedom of information requests had uncovered numerous cases where chemicals were used illegally.</p> <p>The Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation (SSPO), the main industry body, has <a href=\"http://www.scottishsalmon.co.uk/science/sea_lice/regional_reports%281%29.aspx\" title=\"\">disclosed consistent reports of significant sea lice problems</a>. In west Shetland last February, sea lice infestation rates are 584% higher than the recommended levels and on average more than 250% higher.</p> <p>While areas such as Orkney reported very low rates, in east Shetland, they were 222% above the threshold last spring. In northern Scotland, they were 150% higher both in mid-winter and in spring. In south western, Scotland, they were on average 79% higher last spring.Professor Phil Thomas, chairman of the SSPO, said the industry's critics were guilty of making simplistic \"tabloid statements\".</p> <p>He added: \"Are sea lice a problem? Yes. Because every salmon farmer in the world, indeed any farmer of any species, is always sensitive about the need to maintain low levels of parasites on their stock. It's exactly the same issue as ticks on cattle and sheep. The buildup of resistance as a general issue is a problem for all interests.\"</p> <p>Sepa confirmed it had done no studies into the overall impact of these chemicals on the wider marine environment, or investigated whether the sharp increase was justified.</p> <p>It insisted, however, that any adverse impacts from these chemicals were very localised and were very quickly dispersed in the sea. Sepa said it had a \"robust\" system of monitoring and enforcement to ensure breaches were minimal.</p> <p>\"Assessing medicinal use on a site specific basis is the most effective way of Sepa carrying out its duties, ensuring environmental protection and managing any impacts of the fish farming industry on Scotland's coastal ecosystems. In this way, we can ensure that each licensed fish farm is operating within the limits prescribed,\" a spokesman said.</p> <p>\"The effects of sea louse medicine residues on the environment are localised and relatively short lived.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Trades Union Congress has backed co-ordinated strike action by public sector workers over pay and opened up a new front in the industrial confrontation with the government after last year's pensions dispute.</p> <p>The move came as the two largest teaching unions in England and Wales \u2013 the NUT and NASUWT, which represent more than 600,000 teachers \u2013 announced an indefinite work-to-rule protest from 26 September. The campaign means teachers will refuse to supervise pupils during lunch breaks and will stop providing cover for colleagues.</p> <p>The teaching unions' announcement was followed by a motion at the TUC's annual conference in Brighton calling on the labour movement's umbrella organisation to support co-ordinated walkouts in protest at a multi-year pay freeze.</p> <p>The motion states that the TUC will give \"full support to all groups of workers in the private or public sector who take industrial action against cuts or attacks on pay, jobs, pensions or conditions of service and co-ordinating unions taking strike action\".</p> <p>The motion was proposed by Britain's largest public sector union, Unison, which has formed an alliance with the GMB union that could lead to nearly 1.5 million employees in the health and local government sectors staging walkouts next spring if negotiations over pay break down.</p> <p>Dave Prentis, the Unison general secretary, said: \"If employers refuse to negotiate, if the attacks continue, we will move to the co-ordinated action, which is called for in this composite. Now is the time for action.\"</p> <p>The Unison motion was backed by other major figures in the union movement. Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, urged trade unionists to follow the 20 October Future That Works march and rally with a campaign of \"civil disobedience and strike action\".</p> <p>The largest civil service union, the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, called for strikes as soon as possible after 20 October, earlier than the spring action Unison and the GMB are considering. Mark Serwotka, the PCS general secretary, said: \"We need a sense of urgency to turn the words in this resolution into action before it's too late.\" Public sector pay has replaced pension reform as the primary issue for Unison. A three-year pay freeze will be followed by two years of further restraint after the chancellor, George Osborne, capped pay increases in 2013-14 and 2014-15 at 1%, effectively tying the hands of local government employers and the NHS pay review body. With that restriction in place, some delegates at Brighton were describing strike votes in the spring as being almost inevitable.</p> <p>David Cameron's official spokesman said strikes would not benefit anyone at a time when the country needed unity.</p> <p>\"Obviously we think that strike action benefits no one. At the present time, our economy faces significant challenges. What we need is for the country to come together to deal with these challenges.\"</p> <p>The spokesman said the government would not relax restraints on public sector pay. \"We have put in place a freeze on public sector pay for two years. We don't intend to reopen that decision.\"</p> <p>Asked if the government planned to introduce legislation limiting the right to strike, the spokesman said: \"We have got no plans to change the law in this area.\"</p> <p>The TUC for the first time also backed a motion calling for full nationalisation of the banking sector. A statement by the TUC's general council argued that a publicly owned banking service would be \"democratically and accountably managed\" and would play a \"central role in building a sustainable economy\".</p> <p>However, the TUC general secretary, Brendan Barber, said converting the government's stakes in Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) into 100% shareholdings should not be seen as a panacea.</p> <p>The banking union, Accord, raised concerns over the financial costs of such a move, calling it \"a utopian position that is never likely to be delivered\".</p> <p>The motion was heard 24 hours before Ed Balls is due to address the TUC. The shadow chancellor is resisting calls for the complete nationalisation of RBS, the majority stake in which is owned by the state, but he does back the formation of a public investment bank. He faces tough questioning over his support in January for public sector pay restraint, a position that drew sharp rebukes from Unison, Unite and the GMB.</p>",

  "<p>Over the next few months you will hear more and more about 'second screen experience' \u2013 a phrase that means you are on your mobile or tablet while the main screen, TV, hasn't fully captured your attention.</p> <p>The idea that there is space for a second screen experience is based on the observation that people fiddle with their phones when they're watching television. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2012/08/digital_olympics_reach_stream_stats.html\" title=\"\">Cait O'Riordan of the BBC observed</a> that during the Olympics, access of their services on tablet devices peaked at around 9pm with people using them as a second screen experience as they watched the Games on TV.</p> <p>The Olympics are an example with a specific focus, but more generally we can observe people looking up something on IMDB to see where they recognise that actor from, or finding out the music playing in the background of an advert, or chatting along on Twitter and Facebook during shows like The Apprentice or the X-Factor. In fact, it feels like no news story is complete without quoting some snippets of what the tweeting masses thought about the show.</p> <p>Publishers have seen this as an opportunity, and have begun to create event-based \"dashboards\" or second screen experiences \u2013 for example, <a href=\"http://timesdigitalexperiments.tumblr.com/post/24676186450/euro-2012-introducing-the-breaking-news-hub\" title=\"\">The Times' experimental Euro 2012 live hub</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/jul/27/guardian-second-screen-london-2012\">Guardian's second screen for London 2012</a>. One problem, though, is that at the heart of many of these services, the aim seems to be to solve a publisher's problem rather than the user's.</p> <p>The motivation behind these dashboards seems to be a fear of being left out of the event, rather than providing something useful. It often feels like a return to clumsy top-down broadcast \u2013 suggesting that the user can't be trusted to put together their own list of people who are going to be interesting about the topic. There is a valid question about whether people are really going to turn to these second screen services rather than simply use Twitter, Facebook and so on \u2013 that they use all the time anyway.</p> <p>And yet again, broadcasters and publishers face competition from new entrants. Anyone trying to market a service accompanying the Olympics on iOS in the UK had to fight for space and attention against an official app from the new media team at the Games, and an official app from TeamGB.</p> <p>The key to a successful second screen experience design is making a decision about whether you are aiming to enhance the coverage for people who are watching the event, or replace first screen coverage for those who aren't in front of the TV. For the former group, it's no good using the second screen to tell people there has been a goal if they saw it live on TV with their own eyes thirty seconds previously. Telling them that this is Leeds United's fourth headed goal of the season from a corner at that end of Elland Road, on the other hand, at least adds some contextual information and a potential conversation-starter.</p> <p>With hindsight, it strikes me that probably the best second screen experience during the Games would have been a very simple one indeed. One which directed you to the most interesting action at any given moment across the BBC's coverage.

  "<p>Later this week the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/10/tuc-public-sector-strikes-pay\" title=\"\">Trades Union Congress</a> is likely to consider the practicalities of organising a general strike against the austerity measures adopted by the government. Unlike their counterparts in other EU member states, British trade unions have so far avoided a general strike, preferring instead large-scale demonstrations that have succeeded in bringing hundreds of thousands of workers on to the streets. These have taken place at the weekend, minimising disruption to the economy and public services.</p> <p>But what if trade unions decide to step up a gear? One of the considerations for the TUC will be the tight legal restrictions on the right to strike that operate in this country.</p> <p>Even when British law was at its most liberal in terms of the right to strike, there were always question marks about the use of the strike as a weapon of political protest. So in 1980 when the TUC organised a \"day of action\" against the then Tory government's employment bill, a number of newspaper proprietors were able to rush off to the courts to secure an injunction to have the action stopped. It is unnecessary to dwell on the irony of employers whose business is based on the right to freedom of expression denying the same right to the workers they employ.</p> <p>In those days, industrial action to protest against government policy was unlawful because then \u2013 as now \u2013 strikes could only take place in furtherance of a \"trade dispute\". That is to say a dispute between workers and employers over workplace matters, rather than a dispute between workers and government over government policy. The definition of a trade dispute is now even narrower than it was then and tighter controls have been placed on the right to strike \u2013 with notices and ballots imposing additional, sometimes impossible, burdens on trade unions.</p> <p>As a result some people believe that the law presents an insuperable practical hurdle to a \"day of action\" called for a working day.</p> <p>But the legal position is changing. The United Kingdom is a party to an international treaty on freedom of association, referred to by lawyers as <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:312232\" title=\"\">ILO convention 87</a>. This treaty has been said by both the judicial and non-judicial bodies responsible for its supervision to include the right to strike, including the right to strike in protest at government policies that damage the social and economic interests of workers.</p> <p>These are very important principles, in view of recent decisions of the European court of human rights, in which the court has accepted that the right to strike must now be regarded as protected by European convention on human rights (ECHR) which, by article 11, protects the right to freedom of association, including the right to form and join trade unions.</p> <p>The connection between ILO convention 87 and the ECHR, article 11 is this. In interpreting what article 11 of the ECHR encompasses, the European court of human rights has emphasised the need to have regard to ILO Conventions and other relevant international treaties and the decisions of their supervisory bodies. In consequence, the court has upheld the right to withdraw labour in days of action against government policies adversely affecting workers.</p> <p>So we have an obligation under the ECHR to protect the right to strike, an obligation which, under the Human Rights Act 1998 is enforceable and must be applied in the domestic courts.</p> <p>The implications of this were acknowledged in a recent decision of the court of appeal as of monumental significance. Although the common law recognises no right to strike, it was acknowledged by one of the judges that \"there are various international instruments that do\", citing not only ILO conventions but also the Council of Europe's social charter, which the UK has also ratified.</p> <p>As the court also recognised in the same case (in which rail unions overturned injunctions granted by the high court), \"the ECHR has in a number of cases confirmed that the right to strike is conferred as an element of the right to freedom of association conferred by article 11(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights which in turn is given effect by the Human Rights Act\". Game on, as they say.</p> <p>It is our contention that the right of workers to strike as a form of political protest is protected by the ECHR and as a result the Human Rights Act 1998 must protect it in UK law. Faced with an application for an injunction by an employer to stop any such action, our courts would be bound by the Human Rights Act to interpret UK law consistently with the (ILO and ECHR) convention rights of British workers.</p> <p>It is also our contention that it would be possible to interpret domestic law consistently with convention rights to outflank the current statutory restrictions on trade union freedom. But even if our courts felt unable to go so far, it is difficult to see how they could avoid making a declaration that the existing restrictions are incompatible with convention rights.</p> <p>That would then found the basis for an inevitable application by British trade unions to the European court of human rights, asking that court to guarantee for British workers the rights it has already declared for Turkish and Russian workers, where trade unions are also subject to swingeing restraints. Either way, there is now an opportunity for trade unions to reclaim their rights by legal action.</p> <p>So the TUC will be right to consider the legal (as well as the industrial and political) practicalities of organising days of action on working days like their counterparts in Greece, Spain and Portugal. Trade unions ought not to be unduly intimidated by the fear of legal action.</p> <p>\u2022 The argument in this article is developed more fully in <a href=\"http://www.ier.org.uk/publications/days-action-legality-protest-strikes-against-government-cuts-0\" title=\"\">Days of Action \u2013 The Legality of Protest Strikes Against Government Cuts </a></p>",
  "<p>A bomb disposal unit called to the Claygate home of the French Alps shooting victims has been stood down after the examination of items that caused police initial \"concern\" at the address.</p> <p>Surrey police imposed an exclusion zone around the mock Tudor house shortly after 9.30am, closing neighbouring roads and temporarily evacuating the area.</p> <p>They extended an existing cordon and appeared to be examining a shed or workshop in the back garden of the house of the murdered engineer Saad al-Hilli and his family.</p> <p>Hilli, 50, was shot in the head last week along with his wife, Iqbal, a dentist, and his mother-in-law, the Iraqi-born naturalised Swede Suhaila al-Allaf, while on a camping holiday with the couple's two daughters in Annecy.</p> <p>The children, Zainab, aged seven, and Zeena, four, survived the attack, which took place while the family was in the car.</p> <p>The family's home has been under police guard since Thursday, and police and forensic teams began searching the property at the weekend for any clues that may help French police investigating the murders.</p> <p>The cordon around the house was lifted shortly after midday on Monday, and the bomb squad left the premises.</p> <p>Earlier, Surrey police said the bomb disposal unit had been called \"due to concerns around items\" found at the address. The unit was stood down after an assessment, and neighbours were allowed back in to their properties. Surrey Police later confirmed items found at the address were \"not hazardous\".</p> <p>Attention on the property intensified as police in Annecy waited to question Zainab, who was brought round from a medically induced coma after the attack, in which Sylvain Mollier, 45, a French cyclist who apparently stumbled across the scene, also died. Zeena, who survived after hiding underneath her dead mother's dress, flew back to Britain with carers on Sunday.</p> <p>French investigators confirmed on Monday that only one weapon was used to kill the four victims; there had been speculation that because of the large number of shots fired there may have been more than one weapon.</p> <p>Eric Maillaud, the French prosecutor overseeing the Alpine murder investigation, has told journalists he has absolutely no comment to make about the inquiry in France or developments in the United Kingdom.</p>",
  "<p>At the end of July, India experienced the worst blackout in modern history. At least 20 states lost power in three huge grid failures covering an area home to more than 700 million people.</p> <p>In one tiny village in very rural Rajasthan, the lights stayed on. Buttermilk machines churned, televisions blared and fans whirred, providing respite from the drenching humidity of the post-monsoon heat.</p> <p>\"We were sitting in the dark in our head office in Jaipur waiting for the power to come back on and yet in Khareda, where very recently they had no power at all, there was an unbroken supply of electricity,\" said Yashraj Khaitan, one of two 22-year-olds who made it happen.</p> <p>Khaitan, who is Indian, with Jacob Dickinson, who was born in San Diego, has a big plan: to bring cheap, sustainable electricity to at least one million Indians within five years through their start-up, <a href=\"http://www.grampower.com/blog/about-us/\" title=\"\">Gram Power</a>.</p> <p>Three months ago the engineering graduates from the University of California, Berkeley, chose the hamlet of Khareda Lakshmipura to test a simple solar-power microgrid which has the potential to change the lives of many of the 400 million or so Indians who are not connected to the national grid \u2013 not to mention the hundreds of millions of others in the world's biggest democracy whose electricity supply is erratic at best.</p> <p>Gram Power has already turned some influential heads. The two young men are mentored by Eric Brewer, vice-president of infrastructure at Google and a professor at Berkeley. Last year Nasa selected Gram Power's technology among the top 10 cleantech innovations from around the world.</p> <p>Reaching Khareda during the rainy season is something of a mission.</p> <p>From the princely city of Jaipur in western India it is normally a bumpy three-hour drive south dodging cows and potholes before dipping down to cross a barren riverbed.</p> <p>Yet when the Guardian visited earlier this month, the river was anything but barren. Getting to the other side involved very wet trousers and a ride in a somewhat rudimentary boat pulled by a man in a loin cloth. He swam at the front with a rope while cheerful passengers recreated the scene from Titanic at the back. However entertaining, it was a stark reminder of the very real challenges faced in providing essential services to rural communities.</p> <p>When we finally reached the village, locals were happy to show off the TV sets they had bought since Gram Power arrived. But the novelty of having electricity had already worn off. \"Now, they want <em>more</em> power,\" said Dickinson, who normally runs Gram Power's US operation. \"At the start, most of them wanted the cheapest connection, which provides enough to power a couple of light bulbs and charge cell phones. Now, almost all of them have upgraded so that they can run their coolers, fans, their buttermilk machines and, in some cases, their new TVs and DVD players.\"</p> <p>The microgrid requires a source of power generation (in this case a bank of solar panels), which is connected to a makeshift brick substation containing a bank of inverters (batteries which store power during the night or on overcast days) and a computer which transmits data back to the Jaipur HQ. Wires on wooden poles carry the electricity from the substation to each house in the grid, each of which is fitted with its own smart meter, which tells the user how much power they are using and what it is costing.</p> <p>Gram Power sells electricity in units of rupees (Rs) an hour. Prices compare favourably with the government supply, said Kaitan. \"A household with a two light and cell phone connection will spend roughly Rs75-100 a month as compared to Rs80-100 a month with the government connection that comes without a guarantee of the number of hours of supply.\"</p> <p>The pre-paid smart meters have caught the Delhi government's eye, particularly for their potential to curb power theft. About a third of the 174 gigawatts of electricity generated in India annually is either <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-31/world-s-greatest-power-thieves-keep-400-million-indians-in-dark.html\" title=\"\">stolen or dissipates</a> in the conductors and transmission equipment that form the country's distribution grid.</p> <p>Losses hamper work to bring grid electricity to those without it and contribute to what the Central Electricity Authority says is a 10% shortfall in meeting peak power demand.</p> <p>Gram Power's business plan is to make money selling electricity and by becoming a technology provider to the state. At the end of August the firm was hammering out a one-year deal with the Indian government to reach 120 villages, bringing power to at least 100,000 households, said Khaitan.</p> <p>The company is heavily reliant on government subsidies: next year a new law should give companies Rs150 for each watt of power they generate. There is competition for the grants: Gram Power is not the only company in India <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/jan/16/india-solar-power-system\" title=\"\">investing in micro grids</a>.</p> <p>Its unique selling point is giving customers a standard 240VAC connection, rather than just a few LED lights. \"Our consumers can operate any and every household appliance depending on the connection type they choose. None of the competing alternatives, to my knowledge, are providing such a holistic solution on the electricity distribution side,\" said Kaitan, adding that his firm's \"core innovation\" is in grid monitoring, theft detection and a prepayment model that ensures payment recovery.</p> <p>Administering the scheme relies on recruitment and training of a local entrepreneur whom Gram Power entrusts with a dongle to top up the credit on each household's smart meter. He or she buys power direct from Gram Power and sells the units on for a small profit.</p> <p>In Khareda it's a 16-year-old called Banty, who lives with his parents and brother in a two room-house newly furnished with a TV and DVD player.</p> <p>Banty's mother, Lali Devimeena, said having power has changed the family's life. \"Now the children can study at night,\" she said. \"Before, living here was like being in the jungle. Now we feel as though we are actually part of society.\"</p> <p>Despite the challenges, Khaitan and Dickinson are thinking big. \"By the end of this year, I think we can very easily reach 500 households with our pilot grids. After that, the sky is the limit,\" said Khaitan, stressing that his technology was not just tied to solar power but could just as easily apply to biomass, geothermal, or any other generation source. \"Considering the strong response we have received so far and the magnitude of need in India and abroad, we expect to be catering to the order of one million homes in five years.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 12 September 2012 to remove incorrect details about equity funding raised by Gram Power.</p>",
  "<p>Are Twitter and Facebook making the French less formal people, as <a href=\"http://bigbrowser.blog.lemonde.fr/2012/09/07/a-tu-et-a-toi-twitter-va-t-il-tuer-le-vouvoiement/\" title=\"\">Le Monde</a> asked last week? Are we slowly giving up on the <em>vous</em> and calling everyone <em>tu</em>? Or, on the contrary, are social networks' faux familiarity a reminder of the virtues of <em>le vous</em> and <em>le tu</em>? Probably a bit of both.</p> <p>As a child of the 70s, part of the post-May 68 breed, I belong to a more informal French generation, the ones who only say <em>vous</em> to their elders and strangers, the ones who have had terrible difficulties adopting the <em>Bonjour, Madame</em> and <em>Bonjour, Monsieur</em>, always more at ease with <em>Salut</em>. When, as a child, I learned of how French aristocratic families (the few who escaped the guillotine) addressed each other, with children and parents saying <em>vous</em> to one another, I thought it was science-fiction. We were the <em>salut</em> generation, the ones with bad manners. Or so we thought.</p> <p>Today, French people in their 20s hardly ever use <em>vous</em> or tend to think of it like the past perfect subjunctive, an archaic remnant. They have never known the world before the internet and social networks are their thing. They use textspeak, and communicate with emoticons. We had slang, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlan\" title=\"\">verlan</a>, and wrote love letters. They have got tweets, RTs and \"likes\". They set up dates by text, and use Twitter to dump people. In a world where one communicates within the 140 characterlimit, <em>vous</em> is a hindrance and <em>tu</em> a godsend.</p> <p>Things get complicated when different generations collide on the social networks. Last year, as the Le Monde blogpost points out, Franz Durupt, a young hack from the French daily dared to say \"tu\" to Laurent Joffrin, editor of Le Nouvel Observateur magazine on Twitter. Scandal. The older journalist complained and the Twittersphere accused him of being pedantic. He retorted that all he asked for was a little respect, and that the <em>vous</em> culture was exactly what social media needed most.</p> <p>So, just who is being pedantic, and who's being disrespectful?</p> <p>The <em>tu</em> bunch often point to our Latin neighbours to advocate abandoning <em>vous</em> once and for all. However, arguing that as Italian and Spanish have long lost use of their formal pronouns French should do the same is slightly misleading. <em>Usted</em> and <em>Lei</em> in Italian are in fact much more formal than the French <em>vous</em>. Besides, there can be, as in Italian, a political background. I remember my Italian editor at L'Espresso who insisted I didn't say <em>vous</em> to him as it reminded him of when Mussolini tried to impose an equivalent of the French <em>vous</em> on the Italian language (he wanted to use <em>voi</em> as a way to modernise the formal third person <em>Lei</em>). Words are a minefield.</p> <p>I personally didn't have a strong opinion on the matter until Nicolas Sarkozy came to power in 2007. The former French president said <em>tu</em> to everyone. This shocked and infuriated me as it did millions of French people. How dare he say <em>tu</em> to people he didn't know? How disrespectful, how hypocritical, how disingenuous. I suddenly realised the importance of having two forms of address. <em>Vous</em> is not only a sign of respect and politeness towards an older person or a stranger; it puts a healthy and adult distance between two individuals, it gives them some space to actually get to know one another better, to win the other over and get to the stage where they'll happily say \"tu\". <em>Tu</em> is a sign of real intimacy, one that should be genuine, not contrived. <em>Tu</em> is a gift to real friendship \u2013 just not the kind you necessarily have with your 1500 Facebook \"friends\".</p>",
  "<p>An Indian cartoonist detained for his drawings satirising widespread corruption among India's political elite has been jailed for two weeks after he refused bail in protest at the sedition charges against him.</p> <p>Aseem Trivedi, 25, turned himself in to police in Mumbai at the weekend. His cartoons included one <a href=\"http://www.cartoonsagainstcorruption.blogspot.in/\" title=\"\">depicting the parliament building as a lavatory buzzing with flies</a>.</p> <p>Trivedi was put in judicial custody. If found guilty of sedition, he could face a lengthy prison service.</p> <p>News of the case sparked widespread protests among anti-corruption and free speech activists, who complain that India's government, hit by a series of graft scandals, is increasingly intolerant of criticism.</p> <p>\"Politicians must learn to be tolerant. This is not a dictatorship,\" Markandey Katju, the head of the Press Council of India, told the local TV channel CNN-IBN.</p> <p>Last month, the beleaguered government of the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, temporarily blocked a number of Twitter accounts. Ministers have also responded angrily to articles by foreign reporters criticising Singh's record, and have clashed with social networking sites such as Facebook over material deemed insulting to political figures.</p> <p>Ambika Soni, the Indian information and broadcasting minister, told reporters that cartoonists \"should stay within constitutional parameters\", saying \"they cannot make national symbols the object of their cartoon\".</p> <p>Though Trivedi's arrest was prompted by a complaint from a private individual with no known political ties, campaigners point to a raft of recent cases in which political figures have used the law to muzzle criticism across the country. In April, police arrested an academic in the eastern city of Kolkata for allegedly sharing by email cartoons that ridiculed Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister of West Bengal state.</p> <p>A statement from campaign group India Against Corruption, for which Trivedi was an activist, said: \"There have been many instances of harassment of cartoonists and other artists.</p> <p>\"The appropriateness of the cartoons should be judged by the public, and not by the police.\"</p> <p>Broader fears exist of censorship and intimidation. A new cinematic adaptation of Mumbai-born Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children, which charts the life of a boy with magical powers in post-independence India and includes unflattering portrayals of major Indian historic political figures, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/09/rushdie-film-india-controversy-book\" title=\"\">has struggled to find a distributor in the author's native land</a>.</p> <p>Indian television showed images of Trivedi shouting slogans as he was bundled into a police car outside court. The cartoonist refused the services of a lawyer, welcoming his own arrest. \"If telling the truth makes one a traitor, then I am happy,\" he said.</p> <p>The case against him was filed in a Mumbai court by a lawyer, who said the pictures mocked national symbols. Trivedi was also charged with posting seditious and obscene content on his website, which is now blocked.</p> <p>The sedition laws in India date back to the country's colonial days. Nationalist heroes such as Mahatma Gandhi frequently faced the charge during the struggle for independence.</p> <p>The cartoonist's father, Ashok Trivedi, told CNN-IBN his son was being targeted because he was involved in a campaign to mobilise Indians for mass protests against corrupt politicians and bureaucrats.</p> <p>The government has struggled to counter allegations that corruption on its watch has cost the country billions of pounds. Even top government advisers admit that \"crony capitalism\" is a major problem. Petty graft is present at all levels of Indian society and is one of the chief complaints of the new urban middle classes.</p> <p>ADD The Congress Party, which current rules as part of a coalition, later distanced itself from Trivedi's arrest.</p> <p>\"I have no hesitation in saying that the arrest is a bit too far over-stretched...over reaction is certainly not called for,\" said Manish Tewari, a Congress parliamentarian\"We are not in favour of arrest. A society which fails to laugh at itself runs the risk of getting atrophied.\"</p>",
  "<p>People often ask if regulators and legislators have fixed the flaws in the financial system that took the world to the brink of a second Great Depression. The short answer is no.</p> <p>Yes, the chances of an immediate repeat of the acute financial meltdown of 2008 are much reduced by the fact that most investors, regulators, consumers, and even politicians will remember their financial near-death experience for quite some time. As a result, it could take a while for recklessness to hit full throttle again.</p> <p>But, otherwise, little has fundamentally changed. Legislation and regulation produced in the wake of the crisis have mostly served as a patch to preserve the status quo. Politicians and regulators have neither the political courage nor the intellectual conviction needed to return to a much clearer and more straightforward system.</p> <p>In his recent speech to the annual, elite central-banking conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/31/eurozone-crisis-live-jackson-hole?INTCMP=SRCH#block-5040bfdfc0e3d642e636f0b4\" title=\"\">the Bank of England's Andy Haldane made a forceful plea for a return to simplicity in banking regulation</a>. Haldane rightly complained that banking regulation has evolved from a small number of very specific guidelines to mind-numbingly complicated statistical algorithms for measuring risk and capital adequacy.</p> <p>Legislative complexity is growing exponentially in parallel. In the United States, the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 was just 37 pages and helped to produce financial stability for the greater part of seven decades. The recent Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is 848 pages, and requires regulatory agencies to produce several hundred additional documents giving even more detailed rules. Combined, the legislation appears on track to run 30,000 pages.</p> <p>As Haldane notes, even the celebrated \"Volcker rule,\" intended to build a better wall between more mundane commercial banking and riskier proprietary bank trading, has been hugely watered down as it grinds through the legislative process. The former Federal Reserve chairman's simple idea has been co-opted and diluted through hundreds of pages of legalese.</p> <p>The problem, at least, is simple: as finance has become more complicated, regulators have tried to keep up by adopting ever more complicated rules. It is an arms race that underfunded government agencies have no chance to win.</p> <p>Even back in the 1990s, regulators would privately complain of the difficulty of retaining any staff capable of understanding the rapidly evolving derivatives market. Research assistants with one year of experience working on derivatives issues would get bid away by the private sector at salaries five times what the government could pay.</p> <p>Around the same time, in the mid-1990s, academics began to publish papers suggesting that the only effective way to regulate modern banks was a form of self-regulation. Let banks design their own risk management systems, audit them to the limited extent possible, and then severely punish them if they produce a loss outside agreed parameters.</p> <p>Many economists argued that these clever models were flawed, because the punishment threat was not credible, particularly in the case of a systemic meltdown affecting a large part of the financial system. But the papers were published anyway, and the ideas were implemented. It is not necessary to recount the consequences.</p> <p>The clearest and most effective way to simplify regulation has been advanced in a series of important papers by Anat Admati of Stanford (with co-authors including Peter DeMarzo, Martin Hellwig, and Paul Pfleiderer). Their basic point is that financial firms should be forced to fund themselves in a more balanced fashion, and not to rely so heavily on debt finance.</p> <p>Admati and her colleagues recommend requirements that force financial firms to generate equity funding either through retained earnings or, in the case of publicly traded firms, through stock issuance. The status quo allows banks instead to leverage taxpayer assistance by holding razor-thin equity margins, relying on debt to a far greater extent than typical large non-financial firms do. Some large firms, such as Apple, hold virtually no debt at all. Greater reliance on equity would give banks a much larger cushion to absorb losses.</p> <p>The financial industry complains that efforts to force greater equity funding would curtail lending, but this is just nonsense in a general equilibrium setting. Nevertheless, governments have been very timid in advancing on this front, with the new Basel III rules taking only a baby step toward real change.</p> <p>Of course, it is not easy to legislate financial reform in a stagnant global economy, for fear of impeding credit and turning a sluggish recovery into a full-blown recession. And, surely, academics are also to blame for the inertia, with many of them still defending elegant but deeply flawed models of perfect markets that create an illusion of safety for a system that is in fact highly risk-prone.</p> <p>The fashionable idea of allowing banks to issue \"contingent capital\" (debt that becomes equity in a systemic crisis) is no more credible than the idea of committing to punish banks severely in the event of a crisis.

Wow, the Paralympics really have changed attitudes to disability.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>The Economist suggests <strong>disability</strong> is <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21562229\">\"the new green\"</a>, and says business may find disability as important as environmentalism. It argues:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Disabled people are not just potential employees. While working at Merrill Lynch, Rich Donovan, who has cerebral palsy, looked at disabled people as an emerging market and found it much bigger than he expected: \"1.1 billion people, that's the size of China.\" He noted two trends. A generation of people who had benefited from disability laws is coming out of education and into work; second, as the babyboomers age, disabilities are spreading rapidly. That means rising demand for products and services for this unprecedentedly wealthy and consumerist generation.<br>Yet when he analysed companies in the S&amp;P 500 index, Mr Donovan\u2014who now runs his own firm\u2014found that only a quarter had a strategy aimed at these markets and only 6% were doing serious business in them. He has devised a \"Return on Disability\" index, which tracks the shares of the 100 firms that deal best with disabled people. Over the past five years it has outperformed the broader stockmarket. Later this month Bloomberg will include this on its financial-information terminals.<br>Such approaches contrast with the way businesses usually look at disabled people: as charity cases, or as needing lots of box-ticking compliance rules and as the source of annoying lawsuits. Good treatment can make business sense, too.</p> </blockquote> <p>But perhaps the key test will be whether ministers' attitudes to disability have changed. Two families' distressing stories highlight the impact of the government's welfare reforms. </p> <p>Lucy Glennon has compiled a <a href=\"http://storify.com/LucyTweeting/welfare-reform-is-causing-hell?utm_medium=sfy.co-twitter&amp;utm_source=t.co&amp;utm_content=storify-pingback&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;awesm=sfy.co_k8Me\">storify of tweets</a> in which Simon, whose fiance has a disability and son is autistic, describes his family's circumstances as they face a benefit cap and his fiance has been placed on a return to work scheme. </p> <p>And Sue Marsh has <a href=\"http://diaryofabenefitscrounger.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/welfare-warnings-become-reality.html\">published a post by a mother of four whose husband suffered a brain injury almost a year ago</a>, in which she describes how she is fighting for rehousing as well as the rehabilitation and re-education her husband needs:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I fight daily battles, not just on an emotional level facing the fact that my soul mate, my whirlwind romance, my everything, is not the man he was, and all the grief that leaves me to deal with, but surmounting this, then further battles with the benefits system, a car which is on its last legs and not having any idea how I would ever replace it\u2026<br>The system clearly does not work for people who genuinely need it. And I genuinely do!</p> </blockquote> <p>She adds that when she contacted her MP about her situation, she was told to approach the local council. Introducing the guest post, Marsh writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>... we spent two years or so warning what the Welfare Reform Bill 2010-11 would do. We were accused of scaremongering, of hyperbole. But we knew what was coming. We knew what this so dreadful piece of legislation was going to do. Though the Government refused to conduct an overall impact assessment, we knew what the overall impact would be. Why? Because the bill, now an act, was referring to our lives.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Other news</h2> <p>\u2022 BBC: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19539090\">TUC says 'manage economy like the Olympics'</a><br>\u2022 Children &amp; Young People Now: <a href=\"http://www.cypnow.co.uk/cyp/news/1074577/youth-leaders-dedicated-minister-represent-sector\">Youth work leaders call for a dedicated minister to represent the sector</a><br>\u2022 Community Care: <a href=\"http://www.communitycare.co.uk/Articles/07/09/2012/118506/council-pays-out-50000-for-not-meeting-disabled-mans-needs.htm\">Council pays out \u00a350,000 for not meeting disabled man's needs</a><br>\u2022 Independent: <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/government-plans-to-cut-thousands-of-health-and-safety-inspections-8120984.html\">Government plans to cut thousands of health and safety inspections</a><br>\u2022 Inside Housing: <a href=\"http://www.InsideHousing.co.uk/care/labour-promises-to-improve-housing-for-elderly/6523662.article\">Labour promises to improve housing for elderly</a><br>\u2022 LocalGov.co.uk: <a href=\"http://www.localgov.co.uk/index.cfm?method=news.detail&amp;id=106867\">Olympics legacy begins with travel investigation</a><br>\u2022 Public Finance: <a href=\"http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2012/09/tax-freeze-timing-questioned/\">Tax freeze timing questioned</a><br>\u2022 Telegraph: <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9531622/Iain-Duncan-Smith-told-millions-will-struggle-to-claim-universal-credit.html\">Iain Duncan Smith told millions will struggle to claim universal credit</a><br>\u2022 Wales Online: <a href=\"http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2012/09/08/welsh-secretary-david-jones-cornered-by-teenager-over-housing-benefit-cuts-91466-31795418/#.UEtyLXcNOXI.twitter\">Welsh secretary David Jones cornered by teenager over housing benefit cuts</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian blogs</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog\" title=\"\">Patrick Butler's cuts blog</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/sarah-boseley-global-health\" title=\"\">Sarah Boseley's global health blog</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian on social media</h2> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SocietyGuardian\" title=\"\">Follow SocietyGuardian on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/patrickjbutler\" title=\"\">Follow Patrick Butler on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/clare_horton\" title=\"Follow Clare Horton on Twitter\">Follow Clare Horton on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/AlisonBenjamin1\" title=\"Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter\">Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/societyguardian\" title=\"Facebook page\">SocietyGuardian's Facebook page</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian weekly section</h2> <p>SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alisonbenjamin\" title=\"Alison Benjamin\">Alison Benjamin</a><br>Email the SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"mailto:society@guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\">society@guardian.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<h2>What is the farm bill?</h2> <p>The US farm bill is a multi-billion dollar piece of legislation that controls the federal government's spending on farm subsidies, food for the domestic poor, agriculture conservation programmes, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/interactive/2012/jul/20/business-us-food-aid-interactive\" title=\"\">overseas food aid</a>, among other things. President Franklin Roosevelt signed the first farm bill into law in 1933, and subsequent versions have been enacted at roughly five-year intervals ever since. The latest iteration will expire on 30 September 2012. Congress, which is back in session this week, has spent several months hammering out a new bill, which would control farm spending until 2017, but progress on the legislation stalled in July.</p> <h2>Has the new farm bill already been written?</h2> <p>Sort of. There are two draft versions of the bill: one created by lawmakers in the House of Representatives and another drafted \u2013 and passed \u2013 by the members of the Senate. The bills are broadly similar but differ in the range and depth of their budget cuts, as well as their policies on food-aid reform. Legislators will need to reconcile the two versions before a new farm bill can become law.</p> <h2>How will the new farm bill affect overseas food aid?</h2> <p>The US is one of the few major donors that still \"ties\" the vast majority of its food aid, meaning that the food it distributes overseas has to come from US farms and be delivered on US-flagged ships. The 2008 farm bill included funding for a pilot programme that allowed a modest amount of food aid to be purchased locally \u2013 that is, in the region where it would be distributed. A <a href=\"http://dyson.cornell.edu/faculty_sites/cbb2/Papers/Lentz%20et%20al%20LRP%20time%20and%20cost%20Feb%202012.pdf\" title=\"\">recent study by Cornell University</a> showed that the pilot project cut the cost of food aid by nearly 50% and significantly shortened delivery time. The Senate version of the new farm bill would make that pilot programme permanent and slightly expand its funding. The House version makes no mention of it.</p> <h2>Any other food aid changes?</h2> <p>The Senate version of the farm bill makes it harder for NGOs and recipient governments to sell their food aid as a means of funding other development projects. The practice \u2013 known as monetisation \u2013 has proven to be enormously inefficient, as many NGOs have been selling the food that they receive from the government for much less than the food is worth. A US government report from 2011 concluded that monetisation resulted in the waste of $219m (\u00a3139m) over three years. The Senate version of the new bill would require that NGOs recover at least 70% of the actual cost of the food (and its shipment) if they decide to sell it overseas; the House bill fails to address this issue as well.</p> <h2>Why those differences between the House and Senate?</h2> <p>Members of the Republican-controlled House of Representatives were less swayed by the lobbyists pushing for food-aid reforms than their colleagues in the Democrat-controlled Senate. Interest groups arguing against potential reforms to the procurement and monetisation policies include shipping companies, agribusiness and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/mar/30/us-food-aid-lost-waste-profit\" title=\"\">even some NGOs</a> that receive food aid from the government, fearful of the loss of the income from sales of that food aid.</p> <h2>Will the new bill change domestic farm subsidies?</h2> <p>Both the House and Senate versions of the new farm bill would terminate direct payments to farmers \u2013 money that's doled out regardless of whether a farmer does any planting \u2013 as well as countercyclical payments, which offer farmers income support when crop prices fall below a given level. At the same time, both versions of the bill would strengthen crop insurance programmes to help protect farmers from small drops in income. The draft bills also propose structural changes to the dairy and cotton programmes. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jul/19/us-cotton-subsidies-farm-bill-brazil\" title=\"\">Officials in Brazil and other cotton-producing nations will be closely watching the latter</a>, given that the World Trade Organisation has ruled that US cotton subsidies violate world trade rules. If the US fails to reform the subsidies, it could be left open to trade attacks on its intellectual property by Brazil, as ruled by the World Trade Organisation.</p> <h2>What happens after 30 September?</h2> <p>If a new farm bill has not been enacted by the time the current version expires, then what's known as \"permanent law\" \u2013 mothballed, out-of-date farm rules from the 1930s \u2013 will take effect. Nobody wants that to happen, so the most likely scenario is that Congress will pass a short-term extension of the current legislation, then take up the farm bill again in early 2013. But not everybody is happy about that. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/20/us-drought-inflation-food-prices\" title=\"\">US farmers are in the middle of the worst drought they've faced in half a century</a>, and pressure is growing from Democrats, farm lobbies, and deficit hawks for Congress to enact the new law.</p> <h2>Why do they not just vote on it now?</h2> <p>Politics. When the farm bill eventually comes to a vote, it will probably split Republicans, which could embarrass the party, politically. Republican John Boehner, Speaker of the House, controls the voting schedule of the House of Representatives. Observers say that Boehner is loth to put his fellow Republicans into an awkward political situation this late in an election year.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's revolution in social diversity has been relayed to the world by the Olympics and Paralympics, according to the outgoing head of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC).</p> <p>In a valedictory letter to staff and supporters, Trevor Phillips says a decade of hard work has created a country more tolerant than ever before.</p> <p>And yet, after 10 years running the EHRC and its predecessor, the Commission for Racial Equality, Phillips \u2013 who stands down on Monday \u2013 warns against complacency. His comments come against a backdrop of cuts to the commission's budget by the coalition. Unions claim the budget could drop to 63% of what it was at the commission's creation \u2013 with staffing at 72% of its former level.</p> <p>But the EHRC has also been concerned about the government's decision to strip the commission of its duty to promote a society with equal opportunity for all \u2013 an activity seen as central to its existence. \"There are perennial problems for the commission still to address, not least the disparate impact of the economic crisis,\" Phillips says.</p> <p>\"The continued public ambivalence to human rights; and the unnatural \u2013 and apparently deepening \u2013 absence of diversity in our country's political leadership. And there are new frontiers to tackle, such as age discrimination, or the enormous cost \u2013 social and economic \u2013 of widespread prejudices about mental illness.</p> <p>For all that, the thrust of Phillips's final statement is upbeat. \"Who would have predicted that this summer, through the vast refracting prisms of the Olympics and the Paralympics, the world would see revealed such a profound sea change in British attitudes to social diversity.</p> <p>\"The surge of national pride and affection for new heroes such as Mo Farah, Jessica Ennis, Ellie Simmonds and David Weir has not come about by accident. We needed wonderfully gifted and determined individuals to become the catalyst for that revelation. We needed Danny Boyle's genius to dramatise it. But we also needed the talent, the wit and the sheer hard work of many people, inside and outside of the EHRC, to change our country's sometimes grudging toleration of our differences into an enthusiastic celebration of our diversity.\"</p> <p>The Games, he said, reflected positive change at community level and at the highest level of politics. \"When we brought the commission into being in 2007, who could have imagined that less than five years later a Conservative premier would be telling his activists that he supported gay marriage \u2013 and that he would win cheers rather than jeers for the declaration?</p> <p>\"That we would be campaigning alongside some of our most implacable critics for the rights and dignity of older people and Christian believers? Or that we would have helped to deliver, with all-party support, what is universally acknowledged as the most comprehensive and sophisticated equality legislation in the world?\"</p> <p>Critics \u2013 including ministers \u2013 complain that the commission has underperformed and has been poor value for money. But Phillips insists it has much to be proud of. He highlights the body's involvement in controversial cases such as that of Sharon Coleman, who was supported to victory in a landmark European court case after being forced out of her job because of time spent looking after her disabled son.</p> <p>Another case mentioned is that of Stephen Preddy and Martyn Hall, two gay men who won a legal case after being refused accommodation by Christian hoteliers. Phillips also cites \"the delivery of big projects such as the Triennial Review, our assessment of the 2010 spending review, or the inquiries into home care, financial services, or human trafficking, all of which will bear fruit for years to come\".</p> <p>But he tells allies that the commission has worked against an obstructive backdrop, specifically \"our semi-permanent and mostly uncongenial residency in the pages of some national newspapers (not all of the same political stamp) still struggling to come to terms with the late 20th century\".</p> <p>He has also been obliged \"to explain again and again to politicians of all persuasions that the commission's independence does not mean cheerleading for them and denouncing their rivals. The chair steps down a week after Lynne Featherstone, the minister responsible for equalities since the formation of the coalition, was reshuffled to the department for international development. Those who fear equalities are to be further downgraded as a government priority take no comfort in the revised arrangements\".</p> <p>The equalities brief has been added to the responsibilities of the new culture secretary, Maria Miller.</p>",
  "<p>As reimagined by Sir Tom Stoppard and Joe Wright, Anna Karenina seems less bothered about being barred from seeing her child than about being shunned by polite society. She can cope with being sent away on her young son's birthday; but dirty looks at the theatre tip her over the edge.</p> <p>It's not surprising that a contemporary adaptation of <a href=\"http://archive.org/stream/annakareninatols00tolsiala/annakareninatols00tolsiala_djvu.txt\" title=\"\">Tolstoy's masterwork </a>should be so taken with the social side of its protagonist's plight. An affront to motherhood may be regrettable, but at least it means that a dad gets depicted as doing his share of the parenting. On the other hand, the cold shoulder turned against an adulteress by St Petersburg's blue-bloods prompts understandable horror. They're stigmatising personal conduct, and nowadays that's just not on.</p> <p>Today, <a href=\"http://positiveprovocations.com/2012/01/15/how-to-be-non-judgmental-of-yourself-and-others/\" title=\"\">we pride ourselves on being non-judgmental</a>. So, no one's going to raise an eyebrow if you desert a spouse you've pledged to cherish until death. If, like Anna, you choose to desert your children as well, we're cool with that too. You needn't fear being called a bounder or bolter or axed from decent folk's guest lists like poor Anna. Disapproval would be more likely to beset anyone impertinent enough to question your behaviour.</p> <p>Stigma is now seen only as a kind of social blight. It's considered illegitimate not just when it's penalising involuntary afflictions but also when it challenges dubious behaviour that's considered to constitute self-fulfilment. The moralists of yesteryear would have found this puzzling. They believed that only fear of the disapproval of peers can contain conduct that is too impalpable to be checked by law but can still cause serious harm. To them, the excoriation of Anna would have seemed entirely sensible. Adultery and consequential destruction of the family unit posed threats to the existing order that needed to be discouraged.</p> <p>Even as Tolstoy wrote, however, the forces that would erode this kind of attitude were gathering strength. The Enlightenment had elevated individual expression at the expense of responsibility to society, while romanticism was glamorising the outsider. When it came along, cinema did much to reinforce both processes, with films like, well, Anna Karenina. While Tolstoy saw his creation as dangerous, to Stoppard and Wright she's a superstar.</p> <p>Twentieth-century philosophy, psychology and politics took matters further. The concept of guilt was proscribed, and with it went shame. As a result, we may have acquired more personal freedom, but we've suffered for the privilege.</p> <p>Such social control as was once exercised by the community has had to be transferred to the state, which appears to have plenty of power but lacks the moral authority enjoyed by a critical mass of like-minded citizens. This means that laws become ever more intrusive but at the same time less effective. Sometime criminals like Jonathan Aitken, Nick Leeson, Howard Marks and Mike Tyson re-emerge from supposed reprobation as celebrities. Neighbours from hell have laughed asbos out of existence.</p> <p>Some maintain that there's nothing we can do about this. Before you can deploy stigma to constrain misconduct, you must construct a consensus about what's right and what's wrong. In imperial Russia, this may have been relatively straightforward. For us, it's suggested, relativism, multiculturalism and self-worship make it nigh on impossible.</p> <p>Clearly we couldn't shame our own equivalents of Anna and Alexei into staying together for the children. In 19th-century St Petersburg, few wives were prepared to behave like Anna. Today, lots of us want to behave as she does, and we're not going to denounce ourselves.</p> <p>Stigma works only when it's deployed against a beleaguered minority. Still, even in our own feebly permissive world, minorities can be found that we are indeed prepared to anathematise. Paedophiles encounter the unambiguous ill-will of the rest of us. Racists and rapists incur pretty universal opprobrium, and even groups like smokers and 4x4 drivers can find themselves subject to reproach.</p> <p>There are other potentially vulnerable groups that attract no less odium; it's just that in their cases we shrink from backing up our loathing with action. Take bonus-hungry bankers and remuneration-rapacious chief executives. They enjoy near universal disapproval, yet we allow them to pass amongst us unpunished.</p> <p>Why are they even able to show their faces in public? They ought to be snubbed by their neighbours, catcalled in the street, blackballed by clubmen, banned from bardwellsbecues and unfriended on Facebook. Protesters should obstruct their driveways and poke rude messages through their letterboxes.</p> <p>This might not make them change their ways, but it might deter imitators. Either way, it could make the rest of us feel better. And after a successful start on financial pilferers, who knows what other groups of currently unchastised reprobates we might get round to picking on?</p> <p>Of course, there would be casualties. Baited beyond endurance, the occasional asset-stripper might throw himself under a train. Like the good people of Anna's St Petersburg, we could probably greet any such incidents with equanimity.</p>",

Elpida, run by horseracing tycoons JP McManus and John Magnier, also has a large stake in M&amp;B.</p> <p>M&amp;B has been looking for a permanent chief executive since Adam Fowle was ousted in March last year. Fowle's replacement as interim chief executive Jeremy Blood stepped down last October, since when Ivell has been holding the two top jobs.</p> <p>M&amp;B's shares have climbed 2.7p to 281.2p on the news, while Marstons is down 1.5p at 114p. Jeffrey Harwood at Oriel Securities said:</p> <blockquote> This marks the successful conclusion to a very lengthy search. We have always been impressed with Alistair Darby and expect that he will be able to make a series of improvements at Mitchells &amp; Butlers. These will centre on moves to modernise the company and will build on the steps that have been taken by Bob Ivell. <br> There is good scope for the new chief executive to make a number of changes to make the company more attractive to shareholders, including a return to the dividend list.  This announcement removes one of the main negatives, but the group still has an unusual share register with Piedmont and Elpida owning 25.8% and 20.7% respectively, thus having effective control of the company. </blockquote>",

The police investigation appeared to focus on a shed or workshop at the bottom of the garden.</p> <p>Hilli was shot in the head last week along with his wife, Iqbal, and a woman police have now confirmed was his mother-in-law while on a camping holiday with their two daughters in Annecy, in the French Alps. The children, Zainab, seven, and Zeena, four, survived the attack, which took place while the family were in their car.</p> <p>A witness who was cycling past was also shot in the head. French authorities leading the investigation into the multiple murders have suggested the attack bore the hallmarks of a professional killing.</p> <p>On Monday, Surrey police said they were evacuating homes in the village of Claygate after finding items that concerned them. The \u00a31.5m mock Tudor home has been under police guard since Thursday, and police and forensic teams began searching the house this weekend for clues that could help French police find the killers.</p> <p>A Royal Logistic Corps bomb disposal truck arrived shortly after the police cordon was extended, at around 9.30am. Officers were seen apparently receiving a briefing at a neighbouring home.</p> <p>British police are working alongside their French counterparts, trying to unravel the mystery of the four deaths.</p> <p>Officers first entered the Hillis' family home on Saturday after a team of four French investigators, led by Colonel Marc de Tarle, arrived in the UK.</p> <p>In a short statement, the force said: \"Surrey police can confirm that due to concerns around items found at the address in Oaken Lane in Claygate, officers have extended the cordon surrounding the property.</p> <p>\"Neighbours in the immediate area are being temporarily evacuated and we will provide more information when we have it.\"</p> <p>French police have confirmed that the elderly woman found murdered in the car was Iqbal al-Hilli's mother.</p> <p>Detectives had struggled to identify the 74-year-old Swedish passport-holder. Zeena, who survived by hiding underneath her dead mother's skirt for eight hours, was able to confirm her parents' identity, telling investigators who showed her photographs: \"That's Mummy&#xa0;\u2026 and that's Daddy.\" However, when asked about the older woman, the traumatised child told them it was someone she had not seen often, and of whose identity she was uncertain.</p> <p>Zainab suffered severe head injuries in the attack and underwent two operations in Grenoble University hospital, where she was in a medically induced coma until Sunday afternoon.</p> <p>On Monday, the French investigating team said a weekend search of the family home had revealed the woman was the girls' grandmother.</p> <p>In Annecy, police are examining a laptop computer and two mobile phones found in the family car.</p> <p>As speculation continued over possible motives for the murders, one man, thought to be one of the last people to see the family alive, is reported to have told journalists the family had arrived at the isolated car park at least one hour before they were killed.</p> <p>Laurent Fillion-Robin, 38, also said there was no sign of any vehicle following the family. The builder said he had been working on a house in Chevaline when he saw the red British-registered BMW drive past, between 2.30pm and 3pm. The shooting was reported to police just before 4pm.</p>",
  "<p>Half a dozen casinos and 12 huge hotels are expected to emerge from farmland around Madrid over the coming decade after the gambling billionaire Sheldon Adelson confirmed he will build a Las-Vegas-style casino strip on the outskirts of the Spanish capital.</p> <p>A deal to build Europe's biggest gambling mecca has been struck between Adelson and the regional government of Madrid, bringing with it the promise of tens of thousands of construction jobs.</p> <p>The Spanish capital beat its arch-rival Barcelona in the battle to win the controversial EuroVegas gambling project.</p> <p>Adelson, the Las Vegas Sands chairman and chief executive, said in a statement released in Las Vegas late on Friday: \"The regional government of Madrid has been a strong advocate for this potential development, and we are appreciative of the energy they have brought to this process.</p> <p>\"Barcelona is an outstanding tourism destination, and choosing Madrid over Barcelona was not an easy selection.\"</p> <p>However, he announced that Las Vegas Sands was only willing to finance 35% of the multibillion-euro resort, and that it would demand certain changes in local planning laws.</p> <p>Adelson, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/sheldon-adelson/\" title=\"\">rated America's eighth richest person with a net worth of $24.9bn (\u00a315.6bn) by Forbes magazine</a>, visited both Madrid and Barcelona in recent months as negotiations over where to locate the gambling resort progressed.</p> <p>The project is expected to be half the size of the famous Las Vegas strip, the four-mile stretch of megacasinos in Nevada. It is also expected to be split into a dozen sectors, built one by one, eventually offering some 36,000 hotel beds, although Adelson held back from confirming details of the project on Friday.</p> <p>Adelson is hoping to attract visitors from around Europe and areas of the former Soviet Union. Gambling would reportedly account for one-third of income.</p> <p>While the deal may bring jobs to a country suffering 25% unemployment, it has provoked outrage among an unlikely coalition of opponents, including local Catholic bishops and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%E2%80%932012_Spanish_protests\" title=\"\">indignado protest movement</a>.</p> <p>Local bishops have warned that the complex will bring gambling addiction, bankruptcies and suicides.</p> <p>Indignado protesters have pointed to reports of investigations by US authorities into allegations of corruption, dealings with Chinese mafia members and failure to report potential money-launderers.</p> <p>Neither Las Vegas Sands nor Adelson have been formally accused of any of those things, and the company insists it helps investigators with inquiries.</p> <p>Adelson is one of the chief financial backers of the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. His casino empire stretches to Singapore and Macao, where sales are 13% of local GDP. It runs several Las Vegas casinos, but 90% of profits come from Asia.</p> <p>Madrid's regional president, Esperanza Aguirre, from the liberal wing of the centre-right People's party (PP), has promised to introduce whatever law changes are needed.</p>",
  "<p>A recent survey conducted by <a href=\"http://www.eef.org.uk/\" title=\"\">EEF</a>, the UK manufacturers' trade body, found that more than half of respondents saw red tape as a barrier to business growth. These findings are not very surprising \u2013 the easy target in all surveys of this kind is to blame lack of growth on external factors such as regulation, taxation, a sluggish economy, or inability to access finance. But how many firms with the ability to grow address the internal issues holding them back \u2013 things they can really do something about?</p> <p>Once a startup business is selling a product or service that is meeting a real customer need, it needs to recruit staff to grow further \u2013 and this is where problems often start. Many entrepreneurs go into business to be independent, but this often means they are unwilling (or unable) to share management because they are highly competitive and think that no one else cares about the business as much as they do. This creates their first real \"pain point\".</p> <p>At this stage in growth, many business leaders decide to play safe by retaining autocratic control of a lifestyle business, or sell up. To grow, businesses need to develop more structure and introduce team leaders, improve delegation and strengthen processes.</p> <p>A positive decision to grow often requires fundamental change to the way the business operates. But while reason says growth is risky, instinct says growth can be rewarding. If they are to grow in a coherent, sustainable way, businesses need training so they know how to do this. With the support of an experienced coach, they can embed knowledge and adapt it to the business's unique circumstances.</p> <p>This is where help from an expert outsider can really make a difference: it could be an entrepreneur who has been there and done that, a specialist training provider who can help identify skills gaps or simply a like-minded business that is in the same position.</p> <p>Take <a href=\"http://www.cricketerfarm.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Cricketer Farm</a>, a business established more than 70 years ago in Somerset. The firm knows all about making healthy and low-fat cheeses from locally sourced milk. However, in a challenging economic environment, Greg Parsons, the managing director, wanted to introduce changes to make the business more efficient.</p> <p>It was a growing business with 60 employees and doing well, but Parsons felt there was room for improvement. He turned to specialist growth adviser Rhona Hope for support.</p> <p>Parsons's main goals for Cricketer Farm were to win business from food retailers through tendering exercises and to improve the leadership skills of managers within the business. Guided by Hope, Parsons introduced a business development manager to assess new opportunities and help strengthen the brand. This resulted in growth in export sales to countries such as China and opened up the opportunity to investigate new uses for products, such as grating, through product testing. Overall, the main outcome was that the business gained greater confidence in its core product and learned new ways to market it.</p> <p>To address his leadership challenge, Hope advised Parsons to introduce key performance indicators to share results across different areas and levels. This simple adjustment had a positive impact on morale, by making staff feeling included, working as a team and giving leaders clear parameters to develop their teams.</p> <p>Through advisers like Hope, who understand the challenges that businesses face because they've been there themselves, it is possible for training to have a significant impact on business growth.</p> <p>It is access to a network of growth orientated professionals that <a href=\"http://www.growthaccelerator.com/\" title=\"\">GrowthAccelerator</a>, a new \u00a3200m service for high growth businesses, is designed to deliver.</p> <p>A key interest point for growing businesses is access to a leadership and management grant worth up to \u00a32,000 per person (which must be matched by the business) for training members of the senior management team. This match-up funding is available to all businesses supported by GrowthAccelerator.</p> <p>Funding for this type of training can help the chief executive consider \u2013 for example \u2013 how to delegate effectively, to create a compelling vision for the business and communicate this to employees and clients, and how to plan for growth. It can also help the senior team consider how they can recruit, retain and reward talent, encourage ideas and innovation, and build stronger relationships with staff and customers.</p> <p>One thing is certain: there are many tough decisions for businesses to take. Stick or twist? Stick could lead to stagnation and steady decline; twist can be risky. Get it wrong and the business could lose everything. Get it right through taking advantage of the range of high quality support available, and the potential rewards are enormous.</p> <p><em>Stuart Walker is GrowthAccelerator's growth manager. </em><a href=\"http://www.growthaccelerator.com/\" title=\"\"><em>GrowthAccelerator</em></a><em> offers an integrated package of coaching, workshops or master-classes, access to a community of growing businesses and leadership and management support.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>When thinking about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/feb/15/future-of-philanthropy-live-chat\" title=\"\">philanthropy's impact on higher education</a>, it is worth considering the role of the state through the lens of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jun/17/featuresreviews.guardianreview28\" title=\"\">Robert Musil's The Man Without Qualities</a>, as Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri do: \"That people should love each other, and that it takes a firm hand in government to make them do it, is nothing new. So why should it suddenly be a case of either/or?\"</p> <p>The government's overarching strategy at the present moment, in many areas, centres upon erosion of its own sovereign power \u2013 the supposed big society and the small state. This is done, of course, in the name of freedom and a belief that the invisible hand of the market is the best driver of progress. On the other hand, the economic problems caused when the most vulnerable are forced to rely on this selectively bestowed freedom is their enforced servitude.</p> <p>At present, we cannot rely on government to ensure the background conditions necessary for equality of opportunity. If anything, previous positive developments are being eroded by a combination of funding cuts and a significant shift in the terms of discourse, both emanating from the upper echelons of power. The yellow brick road to the world of work leads to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/aug/02/unpaid-research-internships-academic-hypocrisy\" title=\"\">unpaid internships that turn out to be mere tricksters</a> (the man behind the curtain) and the once flowing canal of fee-free HE has run dry. It seems that, whether we like it or not, the world needs philanthropy and, despite the many excellent arguments that point out its injustice, the university system is no exception.</p> <p>Certain aspects of the university have, of course, been dependent on philanthropic funding for a long time, most notably, research. Alongside the cyclical reinforcement of wealthy alumni giving back to wealthy universities, grant-makers such as <a href=\"http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">the Wellcome Trust</a>, <a href=\"http://www.britac.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">the British Academy</a> and a host of others have been responsible for much funding where the research councils were over-stretched. In many cases the pressures brought to bear on researchers and research managers have been positive, as seen in the Wellcome's insistence on open access publications. That said, as Alice Bell succinctly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alicebell/status/237825338661548032\" title=\"\">pointed out on Twitter</a>, this model is fundamentally anti-democratic.</p> <p>On the other side of the coin, philanthropic efforts are emerging for those who have been refused entry to postgraduate areas of academia on the basis of economic class into which they were born. These initiatives act as a democratic (in the broadest definition of demos/kratos \u2013 power to people) correctives against the coalition government's anti-democratic efforts.</p> <p>For example, a nascent northern project, <a href=\"http://minerva-pathway.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Minerva Pathway</a>, is being developed with the intent of unlocking access to the broader world of work for those who face multiple personal and social barriers to entry. The project also explicitly aims to \"open up access to postgraduate education for those seeking a career in a strategic profession where a masters degree or a PhD is a real-terms prerequisite for an entry-level role\".</p> <p>Although this seems like a mirror to private school scholarships, this project is taking aim at the mean-minded \"get a job, any job, and count yourself lucky\" approach which the coalition has been pitching at those who hadn't been able to access positive career development opportunities. The wider picture here is one of evening the odds and challenging the reversal of social progress that current policy and rhetoric represents. Should it attract enough initial capital, Minerva Pathway would fulfil a valuable social function by opening up access</p> <p>What we're seeing is indicative of a wider cultural shift. In the broader economy, there's a sea-change in the social sector and the way that wealth is channelled to good causes. As with social lending, the laudable and legitimate expectation of a measurable social outcome is sitting alongside the new, and pernicious, belief that academia and charity must also provide a financial return. That creating knowledge or providing a service to society isn't itself worthwhile enough \u2013 someone has to get rich, even though that someone will usually be quite wealthy already, certainly far wealthier than those expected to \"buy\" the service their money finances.</p> <p>All of this speaks directly to the kind of society we want to live in, the values we hold, and the breadth and openness of how we conceptualise relationships with those who have a surplus of money and those experiencing a deficit of money. Why is philanthropy needed, and what do philanthropists expect to see in return for their largesse?</p> <p>This is the struggle that we're starting to see play out in the higher education and post-HE arena, with the Wellcome Trust and projects like Minerva Pathway demonstrating positive, socially ethical outcomes even as others focus more on the money.</p> <p>Academia is right to be wary of philanthropy, for all the well-known reasons. However, in a time of pragmatic need, an increasing reliance upon this mode of funding seems inevitable. Furthermore, in certain, tightly defined, scenarios, these efforts can provide a regulative corrective to the problems of small-state, neoliberal government and stave off <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2011/jun/15/univeristies-radical-academics-jobs-training\" title=\"\">the wholesale colonisation</a> of higher education a little longer.</p> <p><em>Martin Paul Eve is an associate lecturer at the </em><a href=\"http://www.sussex.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>University of Sussex</em></a><em> \u2013 follow him on Twitter </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/martineve\" title=\"\"><em>@martin_eve</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>To my shame, I had never heard of Sir Ludwig Guttman until two weeks ago. In fact, I had only been vaguely aware of the connection between <a href=\"http://www.buckshealthcare.nhs.uk/For%20patients%20and%20visitors/stoke-mandeville-hospital.htm\" title=\"\">Stoke Mandeville hospital</a> and the Paralympics. I now know a lot more, after the BBC's television film, the Best of Men, a snapshot of Guttman's work at Stoke Mandeville.</p> <p>My mind is blown. Guttman's achievements over a very long period were astounding. To start with, he was Germany's leading neurologist in the late 1920s. Then, as head of the Jewish Hospital in Breslau, he had to suffer the Nazis' gathering persecution of the Jews, from 1933 until 1939.</p> <p>He emigrated with his family to Oxford, where he slipped seamlessly into a job at the <a href=\"http://www.oxfordradcliffe.nhs.uk/home.aspx\" title=\"\">John Radcliffe Hospital</a>. In 1943 he was asked by the government to become director of the new National Spinal Injury Centre at the emergency medical services hospital at Stoke Mandeville. This was an amazing appointment at the time, when many of the German Jewish intelligentsia in the UK had been shipped off to quasi-internment on the Isle of Man.</p> <p>The spinal injury centre was set up because the military expected a lot of spinal injuries from the fighting after the D-Day landings. I am impressed by this foresight, particularly because in 1944 the life expectancy for someone who sustained a spinal cord injury was just three months. No treatment existed, and people were left to die from bed sores, pneumonia and urinary infections. The choice of Ludwig Guttman showed the military had confidence that he, a German Jewish refugee, was the only doctor in the country who could change all that. There seemed to be no British doctors who had made any progress in this field. Wartime presents impossible challenges and demands imaginative solutions.</p> <p>The authorities were right in their choice. Guttman accepted the post on condition he could treat patients in his own way, with no interference. He set up his unit with 24 beds and two patients. Within six months, the number of patients had grown to 60 and, within a few years, Guttman had transformed an 80:20 death rate into 20:80.</p> <p>Guttman's secret was that he treated the whole patient: medically, physically and psychologically. To him, medicine was not a series of little boxes \u2013 unlike much of today's medicine. He made colossal demands on his patients, his nurses and his fellow doctors \u2013 of whom there were very few in the early days \u2013 and on himself.</p> <p>John Silver, one of his doctors, said of him: \"He exerted a total, obsessive control over all aspects of care at the hospital, whether it was him coming round in the middle of the night to make sure that the nurses had turned patients, or checking on the quality of the cleaners' work or that of the food served on the wards. Everything was his responsibility. This was such an enormous contrast with consultants in other hospitals.\"</p> <p>Please note, consultants of today.</p> <p>Margaret Maughan, Britain's first Paralympian gold-medallist, complained about his \"Germanic\", authoritarian ways. And Eva Loeffler, his daughter, who worked for a time at Stoke Mandeville, complained that he used to criticise her work in the presence of other staff.</p> <p>But everybody loved \"Poppa\" Guttman, and did what they were told. Maybe you can only achieve what he did if you behave like that.</p> <p>Sport was not just to develop a patient's muscles but, according to Guttman, to \"counteract abnormal psychological and antisocial attitudes \u2013 a disabled person's attitude to himself deteriorating into an inferiority complex characterised by anxiety and loss of self-confidence and personal dignity, resulting in self-pity and self-isolation\". <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/27/paralympic-foundations-maverick-doctor\" title=\"\">Sport could bring a person back into the community</a>.</p> <p>The early sports were wheelchair basketball and archery, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2012/aug/30/archive-history-of-the-paralympics?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">the first Stoke Mandeville games were held in 1948</a>. It was typical of Guttman, and showed his ambition, that he held these games on the first day of the London 1948 Olympic Games. That was chutzpah. They continued annually. In 1952, a team of Dutch ex-servicemen joined them, and in 1960 they were incorporated into the Rome Olympics, with 350 athletes from 24 countries. This year, the Paralympics are somewhat larger. After he retired in 1966, Guttman stayed involved with the Paralympic movement, which he had founded. He died in 1980.</p> <p>For somebody to invent a new branch of medicine, to defy the Nazis, to establish a centre of excellence with scarce resources in wartime in another country, and then go on to found a great international movement \u2026 now, that is somebody I would call a doctor.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/healthcare/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the Guardian healthcare network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",
  "<p>Invitations have gone out this week for a reunion of the Arsenal class of 2010-11. Dress code? Tear-stained red and white tops. Duration? About three quarters of the scheduled time, with proceedings beginning in mightily impressive fashion before flopping in the closing stages. Venue? Manchester, of course. Ga\u00ebl Clichy, Samir Nasri and Robin van Persie are already in situ and <strong>Cesc F\u00e1bregas</strong> could be about to join them.</p> <p>How long F\u00e1bregas would last at the reunion is not known, as it seems reunions tend to turn sour for the player: who is currently fuming on the Barcelona bench as Tito Vilonova refuses to share F\u00e1bregas's vision of his destiny. Although the midfielder inssited this week that he remains happy at Camp Nou, a previous declaration of discontent has got Manchester United thinking that they could lure him to Old Trafford. Mind you, Milan and, more ominously, Paris Saint-German are also interested.</p> <p>Sir Alex Ferguson is also said to be preparing to try to persuade the Glazers to stump up the fee and wages that it would require to bring <strong>Cristiano Ronaldo</strong> back to United. After that he might blow up a fleet of hot air balloons, seen as how he seems intent on wasting his breath. PSG are also interested but Silvio Berlusconi is preparing to trump them all: the Italian joker has reportedly agreed a \u20ac470m deal to sell <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/07/pictures-berlusconi-secret-sardinian-grotto\" title=\"\">his Villa Certosa private estate</a> \u2013 whose amenities include an amphitheatre, a submarine dock and a remote control waterfall \u2013 in order to raise the funds to secure Ronaldo, whose private estate includes mirrors, mirrors and more mirrors.</p> <p>One player whon Ferguson may have a better chance of signing is <strong>Marouane Fellaini</strong>, who has let it be known \u2013 and then issued a half-hearted Twitter climbdown \u2013 that his Everton days could well be numbered and thereby aroused the interest of United, Chelsea and Real Madrid.</p> <p>Atl\u00e9tico Madrid are trying to pin <strong>Adri\u00e1n L\u00f3pez</strong> down to a new contract in order to fend off renewed interest from Arsenal and Spurs in January, or at least drive his price up. The 24-year-old forward is unsure whether to sign, which suggests his wages have not yet been driven up enough.</p> <p>And Spurs continue their attempt to find a club willing to borrow <strong>Jermaine Jenas</strong>, with Leeds the latest to come a-browsing.</p>",
  "<p>Peter Beresford's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2012/sep/05/policy-social-care\" title=\"\">critique of Paul Burstow's legacy as social care minister</a> pulled no punches, but history may offer a kinder assessment of the coalition government's record on social care after two years.</p> <p>To get social care name-checked in the priorities set out in the 2010 programme for government was no mean feat. An extra \u00a32bn in the spending review was far better than many expected, although undermined by 28% cuts to local government budgets (responsibility for which can hardly be laid at the door of the Department of Health).</p> <p>The coalition delivered on its pledge to establish an independent commission on long-term care funding, and while many of us have been critical of Treasury-fuelled resistance to acceptance of <a href=\"http://www.dilnotcommission.dh.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Andrew Dilnot's recommendations</a>, there is no doubting Burstow's tenacity in trying to secure commitment to change. Recent reports, indeed, suggest that the prime minister has belatedly been persuaded of the need to implement Dilnot.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/07/careandsupportwhitepaper/\" title=\"\">white paper on care and support</a> has been published, its proposals having received a warm welcome from the sector, especially measures to improve the lot of carers in which he took a particular interest. The draft care and support bill paves the way for the most radical overhaul of social care law since 1948: a complex but long overdue consolidation that in itself is a substantial achievement and enjoys universal support.</p> <p>And amid the controversy surrounding the Health and Social Care Act, the relationship between local government and the NHS has been strengthened through the new health and wellbeing boards, which Burstow has championed assiduously. This reflects a commitment to integration which Norman Lamb, his successor, will share.</p> <p>Lamb's inheritance could have been a lot worse, and he can thank his predecessor for having done much of the heavy lifting during the worst fiscal environment in living memory.</p> <p>Taking a longer view, it is true that progress in developing a care system fit for the 21st century has been glacial, even when the economic sun was shining. A ministerial turnover of Premier League proportions hasn't helped: Norman Lamb will be the seventh care services minister in 10 years. All have been committed and hardworking \u2013 but small cogs in the vast machine of government where social care has struggled to register on the crowded radar of Whitehall politics.</p> <p>There are bigger challenges to come in the next spending review, the impact of the NHS changes \u2013 and crucially, as we highlight in a <a href=\"http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/case_for_change.html\" title=\"\">new King's Fund report</a> \u2013 how we transform the delivery of health and care to meet the needs of an ageing population and rapid growth in chronic illness. It is unlikely that the substantial of policy or its direction of travel will change as a result of the reshuffle. In the long journey of social care reform, it will be the big tectonic plates of politics and money \u2013 not transient ministerial merry-go-rounds \u2013 that will shape the future of our care system and the lives of people who use it.</p> <p><em>Richard Humphries is senior fellow in social care and local government at the King's Fund</em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2012/jul/16/become-member-guardian-social-care-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the social care network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",
  "<p>I will start the review by saying that Suzanne was not able to continue the momentum from the first novel. I am sure that everyone was waiting for the scene at the train station on the return of the victors but guess what, Suzanne just skips the whole coming back scene and tells us about it in the past tense, which is kind of annoying.</p> <p>In the start, the novel is quite boring and I was disappointed by the lack of any progress in the story. The fast paced action, due to which 'The Hunger Games' received acclaim, is not seen anywhere except until the very end.</p> <p>Once again, Suzanne fails to provide any good descriptions of places. Katniss gets in her room, Katniss gets on the train, Katniss reaches the President's house etc. Suzanne could have given a description of the different Districts Katniss visits on her Victory Tour, as well as the spectacular view of the massive capitol. But Suzanne just skips the description part which can leave many readers frustrated, like me.</p> <p>Another thing I really missed was that Suzanne could have made a map of the way the districts are spread around the Capitol now that they have much more importance in this novel.</p> <p>I really did not like was the love trio. The more I read the book, the more it seemed like 'New Moon' to me, which is a novel that is really low on my good reads list. Katniss likes Gale, then starts liking Peeta, and then keeps loving Gale and Peeta at the same time. Fans of Gale will be really frustrated as he does not have much of a role in this novel.</p> <p>The novel crawls at an extremely slow pace, although President Snow's visit to Katniss' house adds a twist in the tale. There is not much progress in the plot in the start, although the sparks of the already obvious revolt are evoking. Things keep crawling on but then the announcement at the Quarter Quell, that is an edition to the Hunger Games every 25 years, would shock many readers. Many readers would love this announcement, many hate it and many will just find it a bit too repetitive, me being among the last group.</p> <p>About the side-characters, I would say that Suzanne does not explore much of their background story in this book too. All we still know about Peeta, the second main character in the series, is that he is the son of a baker. There is a bit exploration in the background of Haymitch, a character I like more then Katniss in the series. But still a lot is left unanswered about the new characters that come in the book like Finnick, Johanna and a few others.</p> <p>The part where this book excels over 'The Hunger Game's is the fast paced action and electrifying moments that come in the last part of the book, yes you heard correct, THE LAST PART. Suzanne did an excellent job in making the horrors of the Hunger games arena, and the clock system was just amazing. This was the part that I liked even better then the previous book and the only thing that I think makes the book worth reading.</p> <p>And then there is the ending, where once again Suzanne did an excellent job, which although was a bit obvious, would still be loved by all the readers.</p> <p><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you've read? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site </a>and send us your review!</strong></p>",

  "<p>The fire is out. The flame that lit up London for the best part of six golden weeks has flickered its last, extinguished in a closing ceremony that brought an end to the Paralympic Games and so to Britain's Olympic summer. Sunday night marked the end of a season of wonder that seemed to surprise the hosts as much as the guests, a period where we looked in the mirror and were met by an unexpected reflection \u2013 one we rather liked.</p> <p>The end came in an extravaganza of fire and light that deployed the now-familiar London 2012 combination of the surreal and the spectacular. The athletes paraded and a member of the royal family made a grand entrance \u2013 Prince Edward this time \u2013 but so too did a motorcade of steampunk vehicles that were part Terry Gilliam, part Heath Robinson, interspersed with dancers in gorgeous costumes and performers doing wild stunts, all backed by the reliable stadium-rock of Coldplay. The audience may not have divined a clear storyline, but it hardly mattered. They wanted to drink in the spirit of London 2012 while they still could, as if they were catching the last rays of a summer sun that had warmed them so well.</p> <p>And so concluded what was surely the most successful Paralympic Games since the first such competition \u2013 an archery contest among 16 disabled war veterans staged at Stoke Mandeville hospital on 28 July 1948, the opening day of the last London Olympics. This time, 64 years later, athletes competed in venues that were uniformly packed, stadiums as full as those at the Olympics a fortnight earlier thanks to a record-smashing advance sale of more than 2.4m tickets.</p> <p>The result was what the sociologists call an \"educable moment\" for the people of this country on a topic that for many has been barely visible and rarely discussed. The subject is disability, more complicated than anything thrown up by the Olympics, but revealed in a new light by the events of the past 10 days.</p> <p>The Paralympic purists would rather we didn't labour the point, preferring our focus to be on the Games as elite sport, no more and no less. The media manual from the British Paralympic Association instructed journalists: \"Anything specifically relating to, or focusing on, an elite athlete's impairment is generally considered unnecessary.\"</p> <p>Plenty of those who got hooked would agree, noting that after an initial adjustment, spectators and TV viewers did indeed start watching the Paralympics the way they watched any other sport, rooting for the home team, willing them to victory.</p> <p>Those who made the stadium roar on Thursday night for David Weir, Hannah Cockroft and Jonnie Peacock were cheering the way they had for Mo Farah, Jessica Ennis and Greg Rutherford on that super Saturday night in August: for supreme athletes of strength, power and grace. But there was more to it than that, a fact acknowledged night after night by Channel 4's much-admired The Last Leg, fronted by Adam Hills, an Australian comic with a prosthetic limb.</p> <p>In his closing show he recalled how the production team had regularly downed tools to marvel at, say, a one-legged athlete doing the long jump. The fact the competitor had only one leg was central to the wonder of the feat.</p> <p>The serially decorated equestrian Lee Pearson said as much when, ahead of these Games, he called on his fellow Paralympians and Games organisers to be less reticent about their impairments. \"Let's be interested in that,\" he said. \"If I watch disabled sport, you're intrigued about who is disabled, what's wrong with them and how it affects them in their sport and in their daily lives.\"</p> <p>If the choice is between emphasis on sport or on disability, perhaps the breathtaking sights on display over the last week and a half suggest an answer: both. For integral to all sport is the notion of physical endeavour within specific constraints, either of time or under the rules: what can a gymnast do on a wooden beam only 10cm thick, how many goals can a team score in 90 minutes? In Paralympic sports there are all the usual constraints and then an extra one: how fast can a man or woman run with this or that impairment? But the principle \u2013 maximum effort within fixed parameters \u2013 is the same.</p> <p>What many millions now know is that this produces not a lesser form of sport but, in many cases, sport of a more intense kind. If part of the appeal of watching rugby is witnessing the physical courage of players ready to throw their bodies in front of danger, then how much more thrilling is wheelchair rugby, a game that relies on the aggression and recklessness of athletes ready to slam deliberately into an opponent, even though that might mean one or both of them tipping out of a wheelchair? The stakes are higher.</p> <p>When Belgium took on Sweden on Wednesday, I gasped along with the rest of the spectators as a player was sprung from his chair and left sprawling on the ground. I assumed paramedics, or at least a couple of physios, would rush on to the indoor court to help him up. But there was no rush. Two officials conferred, debating not the player's wellbeing but whether his team had earned a penalty. The issue was sport, not disability. No wonder they call it murderball.</p> <p>Similarly defining of elite sport is the display of awesome skill. No one could watch Brazil versus Argentina in the five-a-side blind football without dropping their jaw at the players' close control of the ball, precise and delicate. Such control was outstanding in itself, but in those who could not see it was little short of incredible.</p> <p>And if team sports show off the human capacity for co-operation, then that's true of the Paralympics writ large. Plenty of people loved the sight of Katherine Grainger and Anna Watkins rowing in tandem to win Olympic gold.</p> <p>But it was deeply, unexpectedly moving to witness blind runners circling the track, each one linked to a guide, who matched them stride for stride; to see goalball teams, each player blind, emerging into the arena in single file, their hands touching the shoulder of the athlete in front; to see those Brazilian and Argentinian footballers, forced to resolve their deadlocked match by a penalty shootout, helped by a coach first tapping on each goalpost, the sound guiding them towards the target. This was humanity at its best, working together to achieve what would be impossible alone.</p> <p>The world records might not be the same as those of their non-disabled fellow athletes, the times they run not as fast. But if sport is often a blend of courage, skill and teamwork then the Paralympics are sport all right \u2013 only more so. The name Paralympics hardly does the event justice: they are not to the Olympics what a paralegal is to a lawyer. In some ways, they are a more extreme version: they are the ultra-Olympics. </p> <p>But they are also the antidote to that Leni Riefenstahl strain of Olympianism, the cult of the body perfect which reached its climax in the 1936 Berlin Games. How appropriate that those first Stoke Mandeville Games were invented by Dr Ludwig Guttmann, a German-Jewish refugee from Nazism and its pursuit of a world free of both Jews and disabled people. For the Paralympics are the cult of the body imperfect, an insistence that even a flawed body can be glorious.</p> <p>All of this has been an education for the host nation. Irene Oldham, 72 and using a wheelchair to get around the Olympic Park, told me she had grown used to people's embarrassment around disability. But the past 10 days had been different. \"It's been an eye-opener, even for children. They're saying 'I can't believe they're doing this. They can do better than we can'.\"</p> <p>Nearby was the Nicholl family, including 10-year-old Jake, who admitted he was \"a bit freaked out at first\" by the sight of athletes missing an arm or a leg, but who now found the sport even more exciting than the Olympics.</p> <p>The shift was noticeable in the Park. If, say, an amputee in team colours went by in a wheelchair, heads would turn. Not because they were gawping at someone with a disability, but in case they'd spotted a Paralympic celebrity. They didn't want to stare; they wanted an autograph. Disabled people have long reported being ignored, mocked or even abused in the streets, talked down to or just not seen \u2013 but for 10 days, when Cockroft or Weir raced in speed wheelchairs that gleamed like ancient chariots, 80,000 people hailed them as heroes. As Sebastian Coe said in a short, pitch-perfect speech last night: \"We will never think of disability the same way.\"</p> <p>And this has not all been reverence of the familiar, triumph-over-tragedy variety (though there has been some of that). Instead these disabled athletes have been revealed in the same multiple shades as any other group of hyper-competitive super-achievers. Whether it was cyclist Jody Cundy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/31/jody-cundy-disqualified-anger-paralympic-cycling\" title=\"\">turning the air blue with rage</a> after he was disqualified or Oscar Pistorius being a sore loser in the 200m T44 race, it confirmed that Paralympian is not a synonym for saint \u2013 that a disabled person is also capable, as the Last Leg put it, of \"being a nob.\"</p> <p>If patriotism is self-congratulation on a collective scale, then Britain has good reason to feel patriotic. For we embraced these Paralympic Games as no other nation has. The venues were packed, that 2.4m figure five times as large as the 480,000 advance tickets sold in Beijing in 2008. The difference in treatment has been visible in media coverage too. In Britain it's been wall-to-wall on Channel 4 and with big, poster-style front pages on many of the newspapers. In the US the rights-holding network NBC has not covered the Paralympics at all, save for an hour or two on a niche cable station and a planned 90-minute \"special\" to be aired next weekend.</p> <p>Campaigners will say we should not pat ourselves on the back too warmly. Discrimination against the disabled is real and has not gone away deepened by benefits cuts; access in parts of London is still awful; there is even a risk that people might judge those disabled people not capable of swimming like Ellie Simmonds or cycling like Sarah Storey even more harshly, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/30/paralympic-spirit-insults-disabled-like-me\" title=\"\">castigating them for not pushing themselves harder</a>.</p> <p>All that is true. And yet if staging a global event such as the Olympics and Paralympics is a test for a nation, then it is one Britain can justly consider itself to have passed and passed with distinction. These Games were efficient and well-run, lifted by 70,000 dedicated, welcoming volunteers. They showed a nation ready to cherish all its citizens, black and white, male and female, born here or born elsewhere and \u2013 we now know \u2013 disabled and not. For so long, it has been said that Britain is a conservative country. Well, the last six weeks, which began with an opening ceremony celebrating Britain as a place of social revolution, say otherwise.</p> <p>Of course we're not perfect. But if the Paralympic Games have taught us anything, it is that perfect is not everything. Leonard Cohen did not perform in the ceremony, though as it happens he was in concert in London at the very same time. One of his songs would have fitted neatly as an anthem for the Paralympic ideal, for it is a hymn to imperfection. \"Forget your perfect offering,\" he sings. \"There is a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in.\"</p>",
  "<p>Israel has stepped up its home front defence measures against possible retaliatory attacks amid continued speculation about an Israeli military strike against Iran's nuclear sites.</p> <p>As well as the deployment of active defence systems against incoming missiles, the distribution of gas masks, provision of bomb shelters and the testing of public information systems have accelerated.</p> <p>In recent months, there has been an increase in demand for gas masks and inquiries about bomb shelters in parallel with the rising rhetoric emanating from the prime minister's office. But many citizens remain sceptical: participation in civil defence drills, for example, remains low.</p> <p>Danny Avram, the owner of a bomb shelter construction and renovation firm, Ani Mugan (\"I Am Protected\"), said inquiries had increased tenfold over the past three weeks, although actual orders of work had only doubled. \"The last few weeks have been very intense,\" he said. \"There has been more talk, and the possibility has seemed more realistic to people. This happens every time something significant happens in the news. Bad news is good for business.\"</p> <p>The distribution of gas masks to civilians has risen month by month since the spring. According to the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF), 17,573 kits were distributed in April, 38,775 in May, 41,242 in June and around 70,000 in July. But at least 40% of the 7.8 million population is still without a \"personal protection kit\". Yoav Cohen, of the military equipment firm Hagor, said the government was short of 3m gas masks, which he said would take months to manufacture.</p> <p>Expectation of an imminent Israeli strike has been tempered in recent days by suggestions that President Barack Obama may be preparing to clarify the \"red lines\" set by Washington regarding the Iranian nuclear programme, beyond which the US will take action.</p> <p>Some observers believe that the intention of the Israeli rhetoric has all along been to force the US to take a more robust position. However, others point to Netanyahu's lack of trust in the Obama administration and belief that Israel must be self-reliant in safeguarding its existential interests.</p> <p>Officials say that reinforcement of homeland defence measures are necessary, regardless of the possibility of war in the coming months. An official commission of inquiry into the war with Lebanon in 2006 found serious deficiencies in home front defence.</p> <p>The commission's chairman, the former supreme court judge Eliyahu Winograd, this week questioned whether the country had learned sufficient lessons for the possible war ahead. \"We can expect a rain of missiles from all directions and I don't know how well the home front is prepared,\" he said.</p> <p>But according to Yechiel Kuperstein, who was head of the home front command's physical protection unit during the last war, \"the level of awareness is much higher than it was during 2006. If we faced the same level of threat, we would be OK. But the threat is going to be completely different, from another scale. Then the only thing you can do is cover the population with concrete.\"</p> <p>Israel's military intelligence chief, Major General Aviv Kochavi, told a conference this year that an estimated 200,000 missiles and rockets were aimed at Israel and could be deployed by Iran's allies in the event of a war.</p> <p>The military says they include at least 60,000 missiles located in Lebanon and controlled by Hezbollah, plus thousands more in Syria and Gaza. The number of missiles in Iranian hands is unknown.</p> <p>These missiles are expected to reach further than before, with Tel Aviv expected to be a major target, along with cities, towns and small communities closer to the borders with Lebanon and Gaza.</p> <p>Even so, Israel's defence minister, Ehud Barak, has suggested the number of Israeli casualties is unlikely to exceed 500. \"There is no way to prevent some damage,\" he said last November. \"It will not be pleasant. There is no scenario for 50,000 dead, or 5,000 killed \u2013 and if everyone stays in their homes, maybe not even 500 dead.\"</p> <p>Israel has a government ministry devoted to home front defence. Its head is Avi Dichter, a former head of the internal security agency, Shin Bet, who was appointed last month. Netanyahu said at the time: \"We're investing billions in protecting the home front. We're updating our early warning systems and our civil defence systems&#xa0;\u2026 as well as other forms of protection.\"</p> <p>The Israeli military also has a home front command, created 20 years ago following the Gulf war, aimed at \"protecting and informing the citizen population\".</p> <p>The government has reinforced underground bunkers in both Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, to which key personnel will relocate in the event of war.</p> <h2>Defence plans</h2> <p>\u2022 <strong>Missile defence</strong></p> <p>The Iron Dome mobile anti-missile system has been deployed by Israel to intercept rockets fired from Gaza since April 2011, with a claimed 80% success rate. Israel has four Iron Dome batteries, which are mobile, and two further batteries are expected to be operational in the near future. Last year, the US contributed more than $200m (\u00a3126m) in funding for and development of the Iron Dome system. The Arrow anti-ballistic missile defence system is designed to intercept long-range surface-to-air missiles. Arrow III is in development.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Bomb shelters</strong></p> <p>All new buildings, both residential and commercial, constructed in Israel in the past 20 years have been required by law to include shelters. Around 30% of homes are estimated to have a reinforced safe room, but an estimated 25% of the population have no easy access to a bomb shelter.</p> <p>Tel Aviv, Israel's second largest city but one that is likely to be the main target of incoming missiles, has designated 60 underground spaces, mostly car parks, to act as emergency public shelters in the event of war. The city has 240 official public bomb shelters, capable of holding 40,000 people \u2013 around 10% of Tel Aviv's population.</p> <p>The northern city of Haifa, within reach of missiles from Lebanon, is planning to use an underground road tunnel as an emergency shelter.</p> <p>The IDF's home front command website includes advice to families to designate a secure space or room within their home of at least five square metres.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Public alerts</strong></p> <p>Last month, Israel conducted a week-long trial of an SMS missile warning system for civilians. Alerts in four languages \u2013 Hebrew, Arabic, English and Russian \u2013 were sent to mobile phones. In the event of war, text messages will contain \"location-specific warnings based on the trajectory of rockets or missiles\", according to the IDF. Public alerts and information are also expected to be issued by television stations operating from emergency studios.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Evacuation</strong></p> <p>The home front ministry has discussed plans for the mass evacuation of civilians in cities in northern and central Israel to the Red Sea resort of Eilat and the southern desert area of Arava, according to Israeli media reports. Schools and hotels would be requisitioned, along with the provision of tents and caravans, to accommodate evacuees. The former home front minister Matan Vilnai said in June: \"I have spoken to council heads in the Eilat district and they appreciate the importance of hosting residents of central and northern Israel at times of emergency.\"</p>",
  "<p>As the new secretary of state for international development, Justine Greening, begins her first full week at DfID's headquarters, it's a good time to propose that the department supports a new global initiative to add transparency to government financial transactions worldwide. The idea is a simple one: governments should publish the contracts they sign with companies to deliver goods and services. And the UK is in a uniquely strong position to promote the agenda.</p> <p>Every year, governments worldwide sign contracts with private companies to provide around $9tn (\u00a35.6tn) in services \u2013 from running prisons to constructing roads to building rockets. The contracts between procuring governments and their suppliers outline who is to be paid what to deliver which services and when. But those contracts are rarely published, which is a shame, because the information they contain is incredibly useful.</p> <p>For bureaucrats, access to a number of completed contracts to provide the same kinds of goods or services (a 10km tarmac road over flat ground, or 10,000 packages of medical gauze, for example) provides models to emulate or mistakes to avoid, and can be used to build up more accurate cost and time estimates. That is a real issue in government contracting, where <a href=\"http://flyvbjerg.plan.aau.dk/COSTFREQ4.pdf\" title=\"\">planning expert Bent Flyvberg</a> has estimated that large infrastructure projects consistently come in over budget by between 20 and 45%.</p> <p>For companies, meanwhile, looking at existing contracts can help firms to decide if they want to bid when that contract is up for renewal, and provides information that will allow them to put together a cheaper, better bid. Again, that's a real plus in situations when completing a bid on a complex construction project can cost millions. And it has knock-on benefits for governments \u2013 because competitive bidding leads to lower prices. An <a href=\"http://www.eu-africa-infrastructure-tf.net/attachments/library/aicd-background-paper-11-unit-costs-summary-en.pdf\" title=\"\">analysis of World Bank-financed infrastructure contracts</a> in Africa, for example, found a strong correlation between cost overruns on contract delivery and low bidder competition for the original contract.</p> <p>Finally, for citizens, access to contracts allows people to know if they got what their taxes paid for. Was the new school built with the number of classrooms and quality of materials specified in the contract, or did contractors scrimp on quality and keep cash that should have gone on plaster and cement? Again, this can be a serious problem. An <a href=\"http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTDOII/Resources/Roads_Paper_Final.pdf\" title=\"\">audit in 2010 of 18 Zambian road projects</a> jointly financed by the government and donors found that in all projects substandard cement had been supplied and that in half the projects the concrete was too weak. Sometimes, contractor fraud is linked to government corruption, but often bad contract outcomes are the result of incompetence, changing circumstances or simply poor procurement practices. Whatever the cause, contract transparency that makes it easier to understand when and why something went wrong can help make government procurement function better.</p> <p>And contract publication is a global issue, not just a domestic solution to a development challenge. First, poor contracting outcomes aren't limited to the developing world. In the US, for example, $745bn in federal contracts experienced significant overcharges, wasteful spending, or mismanagement over the period 2001-2006, <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-08-26/the-u-dot-s-dot-should-open-the-books-on-private-contractors\" title=\"\">suggested a recent Congressional report</a>. Second, and especially for small economies with a limited stock of domestic contracts, being able to draw on a global collection of existing models in order to better write and price their own government's next contract will be a huge benefit. Third, contracts often cross borders as firms in one country provide services to people in another. Global contract publication will allow firms and civil society organisations to better monitor such cross-border contracts \u2013 allowing civil society groups in Ghana to hold a UK-based DfID contractor to account, as it might be.</p> <p>Twenty years ago, the cost of physically publishing contracts that can run to thousands of pages would have been prohibitive. Today, the vast majority of contracts are available electronically. Most governments haven't altered their practices to account for that, and inertia is probably the biggest factor. The most common argument against contract publication \u2013 that parts of contracts sometimes contain commercial or national secrets which would be complex and costly to redact \u2013 doesn't stand up. And we know that not least because <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/files/1426431_file_Kenny_Publish_What_You_Buy_FINAL.pdf\" title=\"\">some governments</a> have started publishing the text of their contracts. They include the state government of Victoria in Australia, the US county of Miami-Dade, the federal and state governments of Colombia, and <a href=\"http://www.contractsfinder.businesslink.gov.uk/?site=1000&amp;lang=en\" title=\"\">the UK</a>.</p> <p>The UK system isn't perfect: searches on Whitehall's contracts finder frequently turn up documents with entire pages of price data blanked out. But the fact that Britain is already a leader in in contract publication is one good reason why DfID is well-placed to push the global agenda. Add to that the department's key role in transparency initiatives covering <a href=\"http://eiti.org/\" title=\"\">extractive industries</a>, <a href=\"http://www.medicinestransparency.org/\" title=\"\">medicines</a> and <a href=\"http://www.constructiontransparency.org/\" title=\"\">construction</a> that have been vital to opening up contract information in those sectors. And, finally, this year the UK is the co-chair of the <a href=\"http://www.opengovpartnership.org/\" title=\"\">Open Government Partnership</a>, an international grouping of governments and civil society organisations that promotes commitment to greater transparency by member countries.</p> <p>A global contract publication movement is a simple idea that doesn't require a vast new international bureaucracy to oversee. It could start with a small secretariat of a few people, housed within an existing transparency organisation or the World Bank (in its role as a major international financier of government contracts, and as the sponsor of <a href=\"http://www.ipfa.org/news/15660/world-bank-institute-and-giz-first-global-open-contracting-meeting-johannesburg-october-24-26-2012\" title=\"\">open contracting</a>). The secretariat would support the development of guidance and sharing experiences in areas including publication format and commercial secrets and confidentiality.</p> <p>The bigger challenge is political \u2013 getting national leaders to sign on. This year, the UK has both the credibility and the bully pulpit to push for that.</p>",

One of the friends who came with us said: \"We only just stopped grumbling in time\", and a datasearch back on the relentlessly sceptical tone of the pre-Olympics media coverage bears her out. It isn't new. We went round Kensington Palace in between times and were struck by its display on the <a href=\"http://www.victorianstation.com/palace.html\">Great Exhibition</a>, the most successful event ever held in the UK, and how Prince Albert and his co-organisers had to stick to their belief that it would work in the face of what the Queen noted in her diary as the newspapers' 'cold indifference.'</p> <p>Such long-standing scepticism by public and press may be part of our national character and perhaps it keeps everyone up to the mark; we certainly wouldn't want the speciously optimistic culture and denial of problems which marked Eastern bloc Communist countries. But a Levenson inquiry into the corrosive effect of downbeat, gloom-ridden and sometimes sneering assumptions about public life would turn up fascinating stuff; not breaking the law, but braking people's energy, confidence and hopes.

  "<p>Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement has taken a narrow lead in the legislative elections which took place <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/09/hong-kong-voters-protests-climbdowns\">against a backdrop of rising concern about China's influence over the former British colony.</a></p> <p>But while the pro-democracy candidates have a slight majority so far in the directly elected seats, in districts where pro-China groups have set up well-funded, extensive neighbourhood networks, votes for the Beijing-backed Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB) have been high. </p> <p>The first district to announce results, Kowloon West, a sprawling and diverse electorate, saw a high vote for the DAB alongside victory for more pan-democrats, including the feisty journalist Claudia Mo of the Civic Party.</p> <p>Some big names from the pan-democratic camp have yet to hear their fate. </p> <p>The chairman of the Democratic Party, Albert Ho Chun-yan, was not hopeful: \"My situation has been worsening. This is beyond my expectations,\" he said of what he called the most competitive elections yet.</p> <p>Even before hearing about his won bid for a seat, he announced his resignation as party leader following what he called his party's \"serious failure\" to garner more votes.</p> <p>He had lead his party into a compromise with the government over constitutional reforms during the last legislature's term, a move which has spurred support for the more radical People Power Party whose Wong Yuk-man has kept his seat.</p> <p>While the pan-democratic camp has suffered from its internal divisions, so has the pro-China establishment. Close behind the DAB has been the Federation of Trade Unions, members of which have suggested their poorer than expected showing could be traced back to competition with its allies.</p> <p>Leader of the pro-business Liberal Party, Miriam Lau Kin-yee, has lost her seat and is resigning her leadership role, mirroring her predecessors at previous elections.</p> <p>More people voted than ever before, but the 53% turnout was less than the 55% of the 2004 elections when the pool of registered voters was smaller, which also took place amid strong feelings about China's role in the free-wheeling territory.</p> <p>Counting is continuing, particularly for five new \"super-seats\", for which people could vote across geographical lines.</p> <p>Hong Kong's legislature has 70 seats, 40 of which can be voted for directly in geographical constitutencies, with the balance made up of what are called functional constituencies in which, for example, approved doctors' groups can vote for a medical sector representative, or bankers choose a banking representative.</p> <p>This system guarantees a pro-government majority as the pan-democrats face well-financed and organised opposition in the free seats from the pro-China group, and most functional seats go to establishment figures.</p> <p>The pan-democrats have now secured the one third of all seats they desire in order to exercise a veto over future legislation which must, during the next four years, include measure to implement China's vision of constitutional change.</p>"
