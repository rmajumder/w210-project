[
  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Former world chess champion turned Kremlin critic Garry Kasparov has unexpectedly been cleared of taking part in an unsanctioned protest against the conviction of the Russian feminist punk band Pussy Riot.</p> <p>Kasparov, an opposition leader, was among dozens of activists picked out of a crowd and detained outside the court where the Pussy Riot trial ended on 17 August. Three of the band's members were given two-year jail sentences for \"hooliganism\" after staging a political protest against President Vladimir Putin in a Moscow cathedral.</p> <p>Kasparov, 49, was speaking to journalists outside the trial when police grabbed him. He said he was beaten by police, but police claimed he bit an officer's finger.</p> <p>A court in Moscow decided on Friday that police witnesses had not proven he had taken part in an unsanctioned protest and acquitted him.</p> <p>\"I think it's a very important day, a historical day, because for the first time in our courts, the evidence of a policeman was not accepted just because he wears a uniform,\" Kasparov said after the decision.</p> <p>Opposition leaders and activists have frequently been found guilty of charges linked to protests against Putin. Russian law was recently changed regarding public gatherings to dramatically raise the fine for taking part in an unauthorised protest to 300,000 rubles (\u00a36,000).</p> <p>Kasparov could still face criminal charges based on the police officer's accusation that the opposition leader bit him while he was being detained.</p> <p>Police have sent documents about that accusation to federal investigators for review, the Interfax news agency said.</p> <p>The opposition leader said he was planning to file a complaint against his detention and a libel case against his accuser.</p> <p>Kasparov, who is considered by some to have been the best player in chess history, retired from top-level professional play in 2005 to become a political activist.</p> <p>He is a vocal critic of Putin and the leader of the United Civil Front opposition group.</p>",
  "<p>On one of the residential roads behind Luton &amp; Dunstable Hospital, I ring the doorbell of a bungalow that looks like all the others. This one is different, though \u2013 it is home to <strong><a href=\"http://www.ldhr.co.uk/\">L&amp;D Hospital Radio</a></strong>, which broadcasts to patients through bedside units, to locals on AM and to the entire planet online.</p> <p>The door is answered by Glyn Davies, a semi-retired accident management specialist and the longstanding station manager. He gives me a quick tour. I see a framed, signed Emma Bunton solo album, as well as signed memorabilia from David Tennant, Midge Ure and Sir Steve Redgrave. A computer monitor is shrouded in an Iceland carrier bag, at the suggestion of Glyn's OCD brother-in-law, who looks after IT.</p> <p>Studio 1 is occupied \u2013 afternoon host Jakki Bak is broadcasting \u2013 so Glyn shows me the setup in Studio 2, formerly the bungalow's front room. He pushes up a fader on one of the desks and Please Don't Go by KWS comes blasting out.</p> <p>Glyn accepts that the role of hospital radio has changed since he joined the station 33 years ago, hosting a Saturday night show. Many patients arrive with their own entertainment loaded on to iPads, but Glyn stresses that, for those who stay longer, L&amp;D offers an important sense of community.</p> <p>L&amp;D's is a modest set-up, but their permanent home suits them well \u2013 at one point they worked out of a room so small that it was subsequently converted into a toilet. \"We've moved around a lot but \u2013 touch wood \u2013 we've kept going,\" Glyn says. He reaches for the nearest doorframe to touch wood, but it's uPVC.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395155040\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/23/1345738673601/Fun-times-with-LD-008.jpg\" alt=\"Fun times with L&D\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fun times with L&D.

He explains a little about the station's finances. Around 50 volunteers each pay \u00a330 per year to be involved, and the station needs about \u00a33,000 a year more to stay on air. It's raised through bucket shakes outside supermarkets, plus the occasional disco and social event. The local Rotary Club recently made L&amp;D Radio a charity of the year. \"That was particularly nice,\" says Mike, \"because we got a rather good roast lunch at the local golf club, with a glass of wine to go with it.\"</p> <p>Never say no to a free lunch, I say, although I don't think Mike says no to many free lunches. He and Glyn make quite the double act, and while Glyn is dealing with a delivery, Mike talks about the pair's relationship.</p> <p>\"He's put a lot of time in and it's very much his baby,\" he begins. \"Which \u2026 \"</p> <p>Mike embarks on an epic pause. The silence is roughly long enough for someone to say, \"There is an epic pause at this point.\"</p> <p>Eventually, the pause ends.</p> <p>\" \u2026 can sometimes cause issues. He can forget that we're all in it together and tries to dictate a little more than he should.\"</p> <p>Glyn returns and talks me through some of L&amp;D's successful graduates, who've gone on to produce for Capital, Heart and the BBC. The station has also attracted celebrity guests. \"We've had Chris Tarrant, Esther Rantzen, all sorts,\" Glyn says. He tells an extremely long story about Paul Daniels which ends with the line, \"He turned round, said, 'That's magic,' got in his Shogun and drove off.\"</p> <p>I visit Jakki and we chat while records play. She tells me that she's a postie in nearby Leighton Buzzard and drifted towards L&amp;D Radio three years ago, after she visited her mother in hospital and saw the station's suggestions box. \"I lost my mother, which was a massive blow,\" she says. \"I lost a lot of self-esteem and confidence. I had a lot of doubt about whether I could do something outside my comfort zone, but as soon as I walk in this door something comes over me and I'm a different person.\"</p> <p>Jakki's a natural, very relaxed broadcaster who hopes one day to make a living from radio, but she hasn't had any feedback after making contact with local stations. \"I'll just have to keep sending out the demos,\" she shrugs.</p> <p>Mike and Glyn are chatting about something on the other side of the glass. Have they ever had an argument? Jakki grins. \"Bill and Ben?\" She peers through the window. \"I think they may have clashed in the past \u2026 \"</p> <p>Later, I ask them directly if they've ever fallen out.</p> <p>\"Quite frequently,\" Mike breezily declares. \"But we still talk to each other.\"</p> <p>\"Well,\" Glyn objects, \"you say 'fallen out' \u2026 \"</p> <p>\"We've agreed to disagree,\" Mike agrees to disagree.</p> <p>\"I think Mike and Alan, one of our trustees, are probably more level-headed than what I am,\" Glyn accepts. \"I want to push forward. They pull back on the reins. And what people don't realise is that there's health and safety! There's the law on broadcasting! And Alan turns up two minutes before his programme! I don't think that's the way to do it. When I did my show, I had scripts! We're not professionals, no, but that doesn't mean we have to be crap at what we do. After 33 years on the station I still believe that.\"</p> <p>Mike gives me a lift to Luton train station. \"We'll try to keep going long enough to still be on air when you publish,\" he chortles.</p> <p>\"Give it three weeks,\" I say.</p> <p>Three weeks later, I tune in online. L&amp;D is, indeed, still on air. They're playing Show Me The Meaning Of Being Lonely by Backstreet Boys. I imagine I am lying alone in a hospital bed, and I feel quite unhappy.</p>",
  "<p>\"Welcome to Wickford,\" reads the sign. It doesn't add \"you'll never leave\", but sometimes it must feel like that for the Milk. Four mates who've known each other since primary school (\"Earlier than that,\" quips drummer Mitch, motioning at bassist Luke, \"he's my brother!\"), they've made music together since \"geeking out\" on Oasis tunes in a shed at 13, survived three years as the Blank Faced Babies (\"Go up the M1 in a Fiesta with a snare drum on your lap, play to no one, get totally pissed and end up camping on a roundabout,\" is how guitarist Dan remembers it), and carved a reputation in the epicentre of the Towie triangle as what singer-guitarist Rick calls, \"The grungers, just cos we didn't have Kappa tracksuits and cropped hair.\"</p> <p>Asked if there's anything to do here, the band gesture to the Red Chilli curry house, which proudly but forlornly displays its 3 Out Of 5 hygiene rating (predecessor the Samrat was closed down entirely but holds a special place in Milk mythology, of which more later). They bemoan how Adrian's Records, where Prodigy's Liam Howlett would buy his jungle vinyl is now a Costa, and opt eventually to take the Guide to Plazma. It's lit like a Travelodge, plays host to 2 Shoes at the weekend, and turns into \"the Wickford rave\" after dark. \"The other pub, you'd just get beaten up,\" claims Luke.</p> <p>Still, this experience of the Essex you don't see on ITV2 has been poured into a frisky cocktail of subversive soul-pop on debut album Tales From The Thames Delta, mixed into one seamless set by their mate Brad Baloo of the Nextmen. \"We wanted to make a response to Spotify culture,\" explains Rick. \"The best recent example being the Janelle Mon\u00e1e record which came with a fuck-off booklet explaining her whole fictional world.\"</p> <p>\"Our concept was a day in the life of a lad in Essex,\" says Mitch. \"Starting with a phone call, cos the first thing you want to do is round here is score some weed.\"</p> <p>So here's the local colour behind their best songs \u2026</p> <h2><strong>B-Roads</strong></h2> <p><em>\"Citibank pulled a gun on me/ I never paid for my C2C/ And I'm known to a biker gang/ As the next neck they're gonna hang\"</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/a2_NIreNLNE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"276\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/a2_NIreNLNE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2_NIreNLNE\">Reading this on mobile?

Illustration: Matt Blease</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Blease</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Charlie Brooker</strong> If a TV detective didn't have demons and spent their downtime surfboarding or playing Boggle and laughing, I don't think you'd stand for it. You have to justify showing hideous murder by balancing it out in the life of your protagonist. Otherwise people might start to think, \"Oh, this is almost like death porn I'm watching.\" Every detective drama has to have the appearance of being a weighty examination of the human condition, otherwise people start to get uncomfortable.</p> <p><strong>Daniel Maier</strong> Everyone has to have a demon. The dead wife. The drinking problem. Dead wife is quite a good one: Lewis's wife died in a car accident. It's something the show can cash in on later.</p> <h2><strong>The heart of Sarah Lund</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>CB</strong> You've got to have constant conflict. It's not like they ever go home to their wife and she says, \"I know you forgot our anniversary, but it's fine.\" Every 10 minutes in The Killing, Sarah Lund was getting phone calls from her fiance, or that fucking kid she had, always moaning on: \"It was school sports day and you missed it.\" And as a viewer you go, \"For God's sake, she's on the trail of a <em>killer</em> \u2026 \" This new bloke her mother's seeing has a nut allergy. Sarah Lund isn't listening because she's looking at a clue, so she nearly kills him with a cake.</p> <p><strong>DM</strong> It's the married-to-the-job business. It's the spirit vacuum, sucking all the life and hope out of you, and all the ability to love. There's no point in falling in love, because everyone dies.</p> <h2><strong>The tongues of Starsky &amp; Hutch</strong></h2> <p><strong>CB</strong> They usually talk back, because the boss is an arsehole. Or one who is \"I've got statistics I've got to keep up and you're letting the side down \u2026 Can't you cut a few corners?\" We've gone for a slightly grand boss: he thinks the world swirls around him. Which it sort of does with some of the Steadicam nonsense we've got going on. The boss is an arsehole, and even if the cop is an arsehole, he's generally still in the right.</p> <p><strong>DM</strong> There's quite a limited range of boss tropes: the paper-pusher, so you get the renegade cop coming up against the suit. Starsky &amp; Hutch's boss was always, \"I've got the mayor breathing down my neck \u2013 you've got 24 hours to clean up the town and get him off my case.\"</p> <h2><strong>The livers of Bunk, McNulty and Tennison</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395161705\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/24/1345807030513/McNulty-and-Bunk-give-up--006.jpg\" alt=\"McNulty and Bunk give up their parts\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">McNulty and Bunk give up their parts. Illustration: Matt Blease</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Blease</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>CB</strong> The Wire had Bunk and McNulty constantly boozing and they would play it comically. But you were also left in no doubt that they were two broken individuals. These detectives aren't dancing around with traffic cones on their heads and taking Facebook photos. They like to imply that to catch people who are fucked up, you have to be fucked up yourself.</p> <p><strong>DM</strong> It ties in with the dead wife; it's a wife replacement. And, of course, it's more jeopardy, another thing to keep from the boss. It took them a few series before they did it, but they did it in Prime Suspect. \"In case of emergency, you can break the 'alcoholic' glass.\"</p> <h2><strong>The stomach of Laure Berthaud</strong></h2> <p><strong>CB</strong> There was an autopsy scene from Spiral where Berthaud was like, \"Let me just scalp this corpse and wear its hair like a hat.\" There's a cliche of a pathologist who is eating a sandwich while dissecting someone. One of the reasons these shows exist is to deliver a morbid thrill, like those supermarket magazines called 'Take A Chat!'. The front page is always \"I WAS STABBED IN THE EYE!\" above a picture of someone smiling. It delivers horror and gore, but in a way that it isn't like a horror movie. Showing your detective being miserable means you can have a five-minute autopsy scene, because it helps to illustrate why the detective is such a mess.</p> <p><strong>DM</strong> It's quite a contemporary thing, very post-Se7en. It became more acceptable to do these baroque murders, to show the blood and guts. It gave rise to its own tropes: the vomiting rookie, the nonchalant pathologist. I call those \"blue boob shows\" because there's always a woman in the mortuary, where you get a glimpse of a slightly rotten tit in the corner of the screen.</p> <h2><strong>The groins of Rohde &amp; Morse</strong></h2> <p><strong>CB</strong> If you put a man and a woman on screen, you start thinking, \"Oh, I wonder if they're going to do it?\" When I first watched The Bridge I thought they were setting it up that the two of them [Saga Nor\u00e9n and Martin Rohde] were going to go off together. They still had to imply that he was a waster who sleeps around. You then realise that they've only done that to illustrate something about his past. Basically, the whole thing is his penis's fault. He should have offered to blow his penis off with a gun.</p> <p><strong>DM</strong> Whenever that theme starts, whether it's with Morse or Lewis or whoever, you've got this whole zip file that you can unpack to see what's going to happen: a flirtation, a missed opportunity because he's not going to want to expose himself to the risk. And if he does it'll go wrong or the woman will be murdered.</p> <p><em>A Touch of Cloth is on Sunday, 9pm, Sky1</em></p>",
  "<h2><strong>Rita Ora, On tour</strong></h2> <p>As anyone aware of that little-known recording artist Rihanna will already know, Jay-Z sets the bar quite high when it comes to choosing a protege. Their backgrounds are very different (Rita Ora comes from the former Yugoslavia and was raised in London), but it's not hard to see the similarities: both are cool, good dancers, beautiful and, most importantly, great singers. So it is that after success as a guest vocalist on Hot Right Now, the DJ Fresh rave pop crossover No 1, Rita has since had two more chart-toppers with R.I.P. and How We Do (Party). \"Pop\" seems very much the watchword on Rita's upcoming debut album Ora. There's no Jay-Z but all her smashes are here, along with a guest spot from Will.i.am.

There's a balance of muscle and lyricism to his work that grabs audiences and shakes them into the groove. His significant early experiences in the late 1950s were with jazz gurus such as bassist Ron Carter and sax giant Sonny Rollins before he moved on to work with Brown and Morrison. Helping Ellis celebrate 70 years on the planet, and the release of his new album, Tenoration, is a band including pianist Gareth Williams and drummer Mark Mondesir.</p> <p><strong><em>Ronnie Scott's, W1, Mon to Wed</em></strong></p> <p><em>JF</em></p> <h2><strong>The Lady From The Sea/In The Locked Room/Ghost Patrol, Edinburgh</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395059109\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/22/1345654293620/David-Harsent-008.jpg\" alt=\"David Harsent\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Harsent.

  "<p>\u2712If you get your eye in, this is rather a comical administration. They do for the government what that amateur art restorer in Spain did for the Ecce Homo. Or J. Cheever Loophole for the practice of law.</p> <p>Just at the time we need to be delicate with Latin America, they talk openly about storming the Ecuadorean embassy. (Shouldn't we just ignore Assange? It's the single thing he couldn't bear.) In the afterglow of the Olympics they reveal they've been misleading us about the sale of school playing fields.</p> <p>Theresa May won't make it easier for Chinese people to come here \"for security reasons\" \u2013 no doubt terrified by the hundreds of Chinese jihadists now storming round Europe \u2013 so they spend their millions in France and Germany instead.</p> <p>And George Osborne produces a new British miracle: austerity combined with massive increases in public borrowing.</p> <p>I was reminded of the Keystone Cops, rushing hither and thither to no apparent purpose, creating mayhem wherever they went. But at least they gave the impression that someone, somewhere was actually directing.</p> <p>\u2712Phyllis Diller, who died this week, always made me laugh, though she harks back to an earlier age in comedy when the only women who got work were those who were prepared to mock themselves and women generally.</p> <p>You rarely get that now. I never saw her live, but in the course of research into America's tackiest tourist attractions, I once visited Frederick's of Hollywood bra museum. Along with bras from Madonna and the Supremes, there was one owned by Phyllis Diller, marked \"this side up\".</p> <p>\u2712\"Sir\" Richard Branson may be the Julian Assange of British business, in that both believe the world revolves around them. Hence Branson's decision to set up an air service between Manchester and London, above the route of the train line that's been taken from him. (To be fair to Branson, his Pendolinos do the journey, city centre to city centre, in just over two hours \u2013 much quicker than the plane, unless you are transferring at Heathrow.)</p> <p>But my new hate-line is the recently nationalised east coast. Going to Edinburgh the other day our loco broke down, and we limped into Grantham where the management in effect hijacked a Leeds train and made it go to Edinburgh, thus making everyone on a hideously crowded train very late. Coming back they had cancelled the train before ours which, consequently, was jammed with people standing. They wouldn't even bring the trolley down, \"for safety reasons\". They apologised endlessly, but nobody offered a reason for the chaos. And have you noticed the creeping growth of railway talk? It's no longer a train, with engine and carriages, but a \"set\". Trains are at a \"stand\" rather than a stop. We \"arrive into Darlington\" instead of \"at Darlington\". I don't blame them though for the unstoppable \"train station\", an American phrase that distinguishes it from the more common bus station. The British term, when needed, is \"railway station\", but we lost that years ago.</p> <p>\u2712I mentioned last week that we had been to see Tristan und Isolde sung at the Usher Hall in Edinburgh. What I didn't mention was that Isolde was sung by Jennifer Wilson, the magnificent diva who comes from suburban Washington DC. She is a big woman, over 6ft tall and broad to match. Her bosom was simply majestic. All she lacked was a horned helmet.</p> <p>The Americans have a popular if slightly puzzling phrase, usually applied to sports, \"the opera ain't over till the fat lady sings\". When the Baltimore Orioles lost something like their first 20 baseball games one year, they put posters round the city showing a vast soprano in a helmet, with the legend, \"She ain't sung yet!\" They went on to have a much better season.</p> <p>Tristan was played by the Canadian Ben Heppner, and he has a belly quite as superb as the diva's own embonpoint. Luckily they weren't staging it because at the point where the opera is over, the directions say, \"she throws herself on Tristan's dead body\". It would have been like a bouncy castle for several minutes.</p> <p>Her Liebestod was out-of-this-world electric, thrilling, and when she walked \u2013 no, sailed \u2013 into the hotel lounge where we were all having a restorative drink, everyone stood up and applauded. She was extremely gracious.</p> <p>\u2712To lunch at The Oldie magazine, another celebration of its 20th birthday and to mark 75 glorious years of its editor, Richard Ingrams. There is a panache and self-confidence about these occasions which I like.</p> <p>Edward Enfield said he had been invited to a party at Hatchard's book shop, and had consulted his son Harry about what he should say when he met all these famous writers.</p> <p>\"Just keep saying 'marvellous!'\" Harry advised. One of those he encountered was Laurie Lee, by then more or less blind and deaf.</p> <p>\"Your book is marvellous, marvellous!\" he said. Lee peered at him. \"Is this praise?\" he asked. \"In that case I'll turn my hearing aid up.\"</p> <p>Maureen Lipman recalled how her late husband Jack Rosenthal had been working on a play in Los Angeles where he was accompanied by a young female researcher. \"Crossing the hotel lobby he saw an old, saggy man with a gorgeous girl one-third his age. He thought, 'do you have any idea how ridiculous you look?' then realised he was walking towards a mirror.\"</p> <p>And Barry Cryer, one of the magazine's best-loved favourites, said: \"we've got to the age when the candles cost more than the cake&#xa0;\u2026 I can remember when Tony Blair was white. Now he's the only person I know who's a Roman Catholic and an Orange man at the same time.\"</p> <p>\u2712More pointless labels: Nick Fisher was delighted to learn that his bag of Sainsbury's ice cubes were \"freezer-safe\". Iain Kelman was equally pleased to be told that his bottle of Asda own-brand water was \"good for hydration\" (\"as opposed to washing the car?\" he asks.) And driving from Northern Ireland \u2013 where they drive on the left \u2013 into the Republic, John Cartledge saw a helpful sign telling him to drive on the left.</p>",

  "<p>Two US embassy employees were shot at and wounded by Mexican police on Friday after they were caught up in a police chase on the outskirts of the capital, Mexican naval officials said.</p> <p>The US embassy vehicle was attacked just south of Mexico City, according to a government statement. A confused gun battle began around 8am after the embassy car, on its way to a naval installation with two US officials and a captain from the Mexican navy, was approached by car containing armed men.</p> <p>\"The driver of the diplomatic car manoeuvred to avoid the aggressors and get back onto the main road, at which point the crew of the aggressor vehicle opened fire,\" the statement said. \"Moments later three other vehicles joined the chase and shot at the US embassy vehicle.\"</p> <p>Speaking anonymously, a Mexican government security official said federal police had thought the vehicle belonged to a group of suspected kidnappers they were pursuing, and had opened fire on it. \"This was all because of a mix-up,\" the official said.</p> <p>The government statement was not clear about the point at which the federal police got involved, or whether any bullets fired from their weapons wounded the US government workers.</p> <p>It said the US employees were recovering in hospital from \"non-life threatening\" injuries, and that the naval captain was unharmed.</p> <p>The Associated Press quoted an unnamed law enforcement official saying one of the wounded men had been shot in the leg and the other in the stomach and hand. The official did not identify their jobs, but he did rule out that either belonged to Drug Enforcement Administration, the DEA, or the FBI.</p> <p>The incident took place on a highway on the southern outskirts of Mexico City close to the city of Cuernavaca, which has been ravaged by criminal gangs during the government's conflict with drug cartels.</p> <p>A number of different organised criminal groups, most famously the remnants of the Beltran Leyva drug cartel, are known to have a presence in the mountainous area just beyond the Mexican capital in the state of Morelos.</p> <p>Morelos has suffered from periodic bouts of intense violence during the drug wars that have killed over 55,000 people since President Felipe Calder\u00f3n launched a military-led offensive against the country's drug cartels in December 2006.</p> <p>Although attacks on diplomatic personnel are not common, there have been several in recent years including one last year in northern Mexico which killed a US immigration and customs enforcement agent.</p> <p>The incident is, at the very least, highly embarrassing for the highly resourced Federal Police which Calder\u00f3n set up a few years ago with significant US support, and has repeatedly sought to promote as the biggest achievement of his efforts to modernise the country's law enforcement capabilities.</p> <p>The force is still recovering from the damage to its image down by an incident in the food court of Mexico City's international airport in June in which three federal agents were shot dead by colleagues also in uniform who, according to the official version of events, were on the point of arresting them in connection with drug smuggling investigations.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Archery</strong></h2> <p>Archers are required to hit a 122cm-wide target from 70 metres away and are classified into three groups: standing (ARST), wheelchair one (ARW1) and wheelchair two (ARW2). The competition is split into two knockout competitions, one for each type of bow: compound and recurve. Men and women compete separately, in teams and as individuals.</p> <h2><strong>Athletics</strong></h2> <p>Athletes compete in standard track and field events with the aid of prosthetic legs, sighted running-mates or in wheelchairs. They are categorised into several classes according to their disability, which are divided into those with visual impairments, intellectual impairments, cerebral palsy, those with loss of limbs or limb deficiency and those who race or throw from a seated position. One event exclusive to the Paralympics is the club throw, at which Great Britain's Stephen Miller excels.</p> <h2><strong>Boccia</strong></h2> <p>Similar to bowls, the aim of boccia is to throw your balls as close as you can to a jack. Played by men and women in pairs, teams or as individuals, two sides go head-to-head over four or six ends depending on the event. Each team gets six balls per end to aim at the jack and points are awarded for the number of balls closest to the jack in each end.<br></p> <h2><strong>Cycling \u2013 road</strong></h2> <p>Riders compete in road races, time trials and mixed team relays and depending on their disability, they ride one of four bikes: tandems for visually impaired athletes with sighted pilots (B), hand cycles powered by hand pedals (H1-H4), tricycles for athletes whose impairment means they struggle to balance on a standard bike (T1-2) and modified bicycles (C1-5). Within each class, athletes are also given a classification number to ensure they are racing against a fair field.</p> <h2><strong>Cycling \u2013 track</strong></h2> <p>Track cyclists compete in both individual and team races in time trial, individual pursuit and sprint formats. Cyclists ride modified track bikes, where the riders are classified from C1-5 with the lower the number, the greater the impairment, or on tandem bikes for visually impaired athletes with sighted pilots.</p> <h2><strong>Equestrian</strong></h2> <p>Riders are divided into several grades, Ia, Ib, II, III and IV. Grade Ia is for athletes with the greatest impairment, while IV is for those with the least. Riders across all five grades compete in both the individual championship and freestyle test events as well as a team event.</p> <h2><strong>Football five-a-side</strong></h2> <p>Five-a-side football is reserved for visually impaired players. Four players on each side wear blackout masks to ensure an equal amount of sight for each player, and goalkeepers are sighted. The game is made up of two 25-minute halves and the pitch is surrounded by a sound-reflecting wall to help players communicate, while the crowd is asked to avoid being noisy while the game is in play.</p> <h2><strong>Football seven-a-side</strong></h2> <p>The seven-a-side game is for players with cerebral palsy. It consists of two 30-minute halves played on a traditional seven-a-side pitch. Players are classified by disability from C5 to C8, with C8 being those with minimal disabilities. Teams are only allowed a maximum of three C8 players and must contain at least one C5 or C6 athlete.</p> <h2><strong>Goalball</strong></h2> <p>Goalball is a sport for visually impaired athletes. Played over two 12-minute halves, two teams of three players wearing blackout masks battle it out to try and throw a hard rubber ball, loaded with bells, past the opposition and into the net at speeds of up to 60mph. Silence is a must due to the nature of the game, so crowds remain golf-course quiet.</p> <h2><strong>Judo</strong></h2> <p>Judo is another sport reserved for visually impaired athletes, who are given a rating before competing: B1 (blind), B2 and B3 (various levels of visual impairment). Unlike other sports, disability doesn't have a bearing on who the athletes fight, it is weight which determines categories. Male and female judoka compete separately.</p> <h2><strong>Powerlifting</strong></h2> <p>Competitors are classified by weight alone, with athletes of varying disabilities competing against each other in a bench-press competition in 10 weight classes. These athletes can lift up to three times their own body weight, with the world record being 265kg \u2013 the weight of an African lion.</p> <h2><strong>Rowing</strong></h2> <p>Rowing a course of 1,000m, men and women rowers are placed into one of three categories indicating the amount of functional ability they have; AS (arms and shoulders), TA (trunk and arms), LTA (legs, trunk and arms). There are four medal events to compete in including men's and women's single sculls (AS), a mixed coxed four (LTA) and a mixed double sculls (TA).</p> <h2><strong>Sailing</strong></h2> <p>There are three medal events in Paralympic sailing \u2013 the single-, the two- and the three-person keelboat \u2013 with each country limited to one boat per event. Men and women can compete together and are given a points score depending on their disability; the lower the score, the greater the impairment, with each team limited to a certain number of&#xa0;points.</p> <h2><strong>Shooting</strong></h2> <p>Men and women compete across eight air rifle and four pistol events in classes determined by their ability to support the firearm themselves (classified as SH1) or with the need for a shooting stand (SH2). Competitions range between 10m, 25m and 50m distances as shooters aim at a 10-ringed target to try and score the most points from standing, kneeling or prone positions.</p> <h2><strong>Swimming</strong></h2> <p>Swimming in the Paralympic Games is no different in format to its Olympic counterpart. Swimmers are classified by their disability from S1, the more severely disabled, to S14. They are allowed to start the races in various positions depending on their disability so some competitors start standing or sitting on the diving board or already in the pool. Blind athletes have a \"tapper\" at the end of the pool to give them a gentle reminder when they approach the&#xa0;wall.</p> <h2><strong>Table tennis</strong></h2> <p>Standard table tennis rules apply; first to 11 wins a set in a best of five matches. Athletes are classed from 1-11; 1-5 is for wheelchair athletes, 6-10 is for standing athletes and 11 for those with intellectual disabilities \u2013 the lower the number, the greater the impairment. Men and women compete individually and in team events for 29 medals.</p> <h2><strong>Sitting volleyball</strong></h2> <p>Rules are the same as Olympic volleyball but part of the body, between the buttocks and the shoulder, must be in contact with the court when a shot is made. Two teams of six players contest five set matches, with the winner of each set being the first to 25 points. Players are either classed as \"disabled\" or those with \"minimal disability\", with a maximum of one \"minimally disabled\" player allowed on the court per team. Men and women compete in different competitions, but follow the same format.</p> <h2><strong>Wheelchair basketball</strong></h2> <p>Two teams of five players compete on a standard basketball court with 10ft-high hoops. Players must throw or bounce the ball after every two pushes of the wheels on their chairs to avoid being penalised. Scoring is the same as Olympic basketball: two points for a regular shot, one for each successful free throw and three for a shot from distance. Each player is rated between 1 and 4.5, depending on their functional ability, and teams must not exceed 14 points on court at any one time. Men and women compete separately and each team has seven substitutes.</p> <h2><strong>Wheelchair fencing</strong></h2> <p>Fencers are fastened to a platform in their wheelchairs, set a fixed distance apart. Competitors fight in three categories \u2013 foil, sabre and epee \u2013 and each weapon has its own scoring area, with the foil scoring if contact with the torso is made, while sabre and epee can connect anywhere above the waist. Men and women fight in different competitions, and fighters are given a classification of either A or B, the latter being for the greater impairment.</p> <h2><strong>Wheelchair rugby</strong></h2> <p>Wheelchair rugby \u2013 otherwise known as murderball \u2013 sees two teams of four compete on a basketball court-sized playing area, with each team allowed eight rolling substitutes. The aim is to carry the ball across the opponent's goalline to score a try. A match consists of four eight-minute quarters with each team allowed 40 seconds in possession. Players have 10 seconds to either pass, score or bounce the ball before a foul is awarded. They are classified with a points score from 0.5 for those with the least physical function to 3.5 for those with the most. During the game, the team cannot exceed a total of eight points across those in play at one time.</p> <h2><strong>Wheelchair tennis</strong></h2> <p>Wheelchair tennis has one key difference from standard tennis regulations: the ball is allowed to bounce twice to allow athletes time to navigate the court. Athletes compete in men's and women's singles and doubles and both men and women compete in the quad singles \u2013 the category for players with an impairment in three or more limbs.</p> <h2>How it works: In the Paralympic kitbag</h2> <p><strong>Boats, adaptive rowing </strong>Boats used by arms-only single scullers, such as Tom Aggar, feature a wider hull with stabilisers on each side. Competitors are strapped into a fixed seat to prevent leaning forward and gaining an unfair advantage.</p> <p><strong>Bicycles, cycling </strong>There are four types of cycles: a tandem used by those with a visual impairment, in which the blind cyclist sits at the rear and a sighted pilot at the front; tricycles for those whose balance makes them unable to race on two wheels; handcycles, with the pedals operated by hand; and modified bicycles.</p> <p><strong>Balls, football </strong>Similar to those used in able bodied football, except the inside of the ball contains ball bearings. This causes the ball to rattle when it moves, making it audible to blind players.</p> <p><strong>Soles, athletics </strong>In the past, athletes would often glue the sole of a trainer to their prosthesis, crudely imitating the effect of a regular running shoe. Now, sports brands have developed more sophisticated soles that can be clipped onto the prosthesis of an athlete, giving it the feel of a regular running shoe, while providing traction, comfort and support.</p> <p><strong>Wheelchairs, rugby </strong>Chairs are designed for high impacts, featuring a large bumper, and wings in front of the wheels, preventing the chair being caught by other competitors. Spoke protectors are also used.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Day one: 30 August</strong></h2> <p>The opening day of the Paralympic Games and already there are finals galore, 15 of them in the aquatic centre alone. Susannah Rodgers, surprise package of the 2011 IPC European championships, will look to emulate her five gold medals from Berlin in the S7 100m backstroke (heats 10.41am, final 6.50pm) while Jonathan Fox races in the men's S7 100m backstroke (heats 10.31am, final 6.44pm). Natalie Du Toit goes for her 11th Paralympic gold in the S9 100m butterfly (heats 10.53am, final 7.17pm) and the Ukrainian teenager Yevheniy Bohodayko looks to make an impression in his first Games in the S6 100m backstroke (heats 9.30am, final 5.30pm). Also, world and European 60kg judo champion Ben Quilter is in action (from 11am) and Sarah Storey goes for gold in the velodrome in the C5 pursuit (quals 10.40am, final 4.50pm).</p> <h2><strong>Day two: 31 August</strong></h2> <p>If day one provided plenty of thrills, day two also promises not to disappoint. Jody Cundy takes to the velodrome in the C4 1k time trial (2pm), aiming to defend his 2008 title. Cundy is just one of many Paralympians who switched sports, starting out as a swimmer before making the move into track cycling. Judging by his trophy cabinet, it was the right decision. Jon-Allan Butterworth also races. In the pool, brothers Sam and Oliver Hynd go head-to-head in the S8 400m freestyle (heats 9.30am, final 5.30pm), Nathan Stephens takes time off from the javelin to throw the discus in the F57/58 competition (7.05pm) and \"Hurricane\" Hannah Cockroft races in the T34 100m (8.18pm).</p> <h2><strong>Day three: 1 September</strong></h2> <p>The seven-a-side football tournament gets underway, with Great Britain up against Brazil (4.15pm). There's no doubting this will be a tough match, but Brazil racked up 6-0 and 4-0 defeats against Ukraine and Iran in Beijing, so GB will be hoping to start their Games with a win. The defending champions, Ukraine, kick off against the USA (2pm) and the 2008 silver medallists, Russia, face Argentina (9am). On the track, the Irish sprinter Jason Smyth, who trains with Tyson Gay, should make the T13 100m final (8pm) and could grab his first medal of the Games while Matt Skelhon targets gold in the 10m air rifle prone shooting event (qualification 1.15pm, finals 4pm).</p> <h2><strong>Day four: 2 September</strong></h2> <p>Britain's dominance in the velodrome looks set to continue as the nation's Paracycling elite take to the track. Today sees the men's team sprint finals (qualifications 11:35am, finals 3:25pm) with Darren Kenny, Rik Waddon and Jon-Allan Butterworth going for gold. GB held off China to win in 2008, and they'll be doing all they can for a repeat performance without the experience of Cundy. Also in action is the world No1 table tennis ace, Will Bayley, in the Class 7 competition (5.15pm). Elsewhere, the unbeaten rowing machine Tom Aggar should be in the single sculls final over at Eton Dorney, while \"Discus\" Dan Greaves takes to the field in the Olympic Stadium (11.40am).</p> <h2><strong>Day five: 3 September</strong></h2> <p>GB's Lee Pearson is a nine-times Paralympics gold medallist, and by the end of today he could have equalled Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson's record of 11 Paralympic golds with a win in the equestrian mixed individual freestyle Ib event (2.15pm). He has won three successive hat-tricks of gold medals since Sydney and along with his horse, Gentleman, he'll want more. Today is also the last of the group games in the wheelchair basketball competition, with GB's&#xa0;men (3.15pm) and women (1pm) looking to finish strongly and get a favourable draw in the knockout&#xa0;stages.</p> <h2><strong>Day six: 4 September</strong></h2> <p>It's going to be a tense day at the ExCeL as the first boccia medals are dished out in the pairs and team events. GB's BC1-2 team are fancied favourites for the team event (5.50pm) with the seasoned pro Nigel Murray and the live-wire David Smith. Meanwhile at the Royal Artillery Barracks, the Paralympic, world and European compound champion Danielle Brown defends her archery title (semi-finals 3.30pm, finals 4pm) as Sophie Christiansen does the same on horseback at Greenwich Park (3.45pm).</p> <h2><strong>Day seven: 5 September</strong></h2> <p>How about some murderball to kick off day seven of the Paralympic Games? Today sees the wheelchair rugby competition get started (2pm) and you can expect more crashes than a monster truck rally as GB go up against the force of USA, Canada and the Ryley Batt-powered Australia. In the pool, best of friends Liz Johnson and Charlotte Henshaw go head-to-head in the SB6 100m backstroke (heats 11.05am, final 7.21pm) while out on the roads, Darren Kenny will be looking to upgrade his silver from Beijing to a gold in the C3 time trials (10.30am).</p> <h2><strong>Day eight: 6 September</strong></h2> <p>There may have been a brief look at South Africa's Oscar Pistorius during the Olympic Games, but the Blade Runner really comes into his own today. The T44 100m (9.58pm) is one of the highlight events of the entire Games and should see Pistorius pushed all the way to retain his gold medal. Great Britain's Jonnie Peacock is the fastest man on the track, but the USA's Jerome Singleton and South Africa's Arnu Fourie are not far behind. This race should be a little closer than Usain Bolt's romp to gold. GB's Libby Clegg and Hannah Cockroft are also in action today, racing in the T12 200m (semi-finals 12.41pm, finals 7.42pm) and the T34 200m (round 11.47am, final 8.12pm)</p> <h2><strong>Day nine: 7 September</strong></h2> <p>The chances are that if you're watching the tennis today you'll see Esther Vergeer in the women's singles tennis final (12pm). The Dutch ace is unbeaten in an incredible nine years, holding the No1 ranking since 1999 \u2013 take that, Roger. Also today is the final of the women's wheelchair basketball competition (9.15pm), where the USA will look to defend their Beijing title, as well as the final day of the goalball tournaments (women's final 3pm, men's final 8pm).</p> <h2><strong>Day ten: 8 September</strong></h2> <p>The competition has been whittled down and today sees the final of the five-a-side football tournament (3.30pm). Brazil won in 2004 and 2008 so are odds-on favourites to retain their title, but they face an inevitable challenge from Spain, Argentina and the David Clarke-inspired Great Britain. There is a feast of finals today with Peter \"The Quadfather\" Norfolk fancied to reach the mixed quad singles wheelchair tennis final (12pm), Ellie Simmonds in the 100m S6 freestyle (heats 9.57am, final 5.47pm), Nathan Stephens on javelin duty (7.05pm) and Oscar Pistorius racing in the T44 400m final (10.04pm). The men's wheelchair basketball final (9.15pm) and bronze medal (7pm) matches are also today.</p> <h2><strong>Day eleven: 9 September</strong></h2> <p>The men's wheelchair marathon is the fastest on the planet. The world record stands at just 1hr 20 min 14sec in the T54 class for the whopping 26.2m course \u2013 50 minutes faster than Stephen Kiprotich's Olympics-winning time. With six-times London Marathon winner David Weir going up against racing legend Heinz Frei, Kurt Fearnley and Marcel Hug in the T54 race (11.30am) it promises to be a dramatic contest on the streets of London, with Weir hoping to have the edge thanks to the home crowd. Indoors, the finals of the wheelchair rugby (12pm) take place, with the USA, Canada and Australia all among the favourites to make it.</p>",
  "<p>Jonnie Peacock has the irrepressible enthusiasm and confidence that come of possessing that headiest of combinations: youth and precocious talent. The 19-year-old single amputee sprinter \u2013 Great Britain's real hope against South Africa's Oscar Pistorius in the men's T43-T44 100m \u2013 bounces in his seat, smiles readily, cracks jokes and generally appears to be having a marvellous time since his selection.</p> <p>Since he broke the world record in the 100m at the US Paralympic track and field trials at the start of last month, Peacock has been making people take notice. A relative novice \u2013 he came first in his very first international race at the Paralympic World Cup in Manchester in May \u2013 he has been improving at a rate which makes him a serious contender for the final. But, for the moment, he is refusing to bow to the pressure.</p> <p>\"I don't really feel it too much, although everyone is trying to put it on me and wrap gold medals around my neck,\" he says. \"I'm only 19 and this is my first Paralympics; if you had asked me two years ago if I wanted to go to London I would have hit you in the face for even suggesting it.\"</p> <p>Fortunately Peacock is a sprinter, not a fighter and one who has taken almost a second off his time in 12 months. Last year his personal best was 11.47sec and before the US trails it stood at 11.24. But in Indianapolis he surpassed previous times, running 10.85, 0.06 faster than the previous T44 record set in 2007 by the USA's 2004 champion, Marlon Shirley, and better than the 10.91 mark set by Pistorius, a T43 (the classification for athletes with double amputations below the knee) sprinter, five years ago.</p> <p>But reflecting on the race, he is far from happy with his \"poor execution\" \u2013 and thinks London is just the place to show improvement. \"I'll smash it in London,\" he says. \"That's the plan.\"</p> <p>Peacock \u2013 who lost his right leg below the knee after contracting a form of meningitis at the age of five \u2013 got into sprinting almost accidentally. With the aim of joining a football team, he enquired about disability sport at the hospital that fitted his prosthetic leg and they pointed him to a Paralympic talent day in Mile End, London. At a subsequent five-month intensive programme he found himself in a bidding war between wheelchair tennis, shooting and athletics. \"Obviously I picked athletics because it's the best event,\" he says. \"I just love sprinting because it's so raw. Literally from here to here, how fast can you go? You don't pace yourself, just go nuts. Pure speed: I love it.\"</p> <p>Watching Pistorius at Beijing 2008 provided extra motivation and by 2009, he was making his debut 100m at the London disability athletics challenge. He does not disguise his admiration for Pistorius who \u2013 since becoming the first amputee to compete both in the Olympics and Paralympics \u2013 has done more to raise the profile of disabled sport than any other athlete.</p> <p>\"I have so much respect for him,\" Peacock says of the Blade Runner. \"He doesn't try and get by on talent \u2013 he outworks his talent, everything he has achieved is down to him. But he's also one of the nicest guys I've ever met, he's got a smile for everyone.\"</p> <p>And advice and encouragement: Pistorius recommended the blade that Peacock now runs on, and after his world record time in the States, Pistorius tweeted: \"Well done, great to see progress in the sport. Looking forward to a very fast race at London&#xa0;2012.\"</p> <p>Despite Pistorius's dominance in the sprints \u2013 he won the 100m, 200m and 400m in Beijing \u2013 the field this year has been blown wide open. The USA's Jerome Singleton, who took silver in Beijing, will be challenging again for first place, while the single amputee Arnu Fourie, also a South African, has run impressive times and beat Pistorius over 100m back home in March.</p> <p>The cheers for Pistorius at London 2012 are likely to be deafening but Peacock hopes the home advantage will work in his favour. \"I hope people remember who is wearing the GB vest in that lineup,\" he says. \"Hopefully they will be cheering the right guy.\"</p> <p>Unlike Pistorius, Peacock has no intention of training for an Olympics. He points out that the South African competes in the longer 400m, because in the shorter sprints his start is compromised because of his blades. \"Genetically, I'm a 100m runner, not a 400m runner. I could train for it and put down a decent time, but at the end of the day I'm not a 400m Olympic runner, I'm a 100m Paralympic runner,\" he says.</p> <p>With cropped strawberry blond hair and a twinkle in his eye, it is easy to see how Peacock could become the GB poster boy for this Paralympics. His irreverent humour \u2013 a recent tweet featured his prosthetic limb sticking out of a empty \"ghost\" tracksuit \u2013 and refusal to be pitied will also endear him to London crowds.</p> <p>\"When I was 13-14 I used to think: 'Why me?' But I wouldn't wish for a second now that I had two legs,\" he says. \"I wouldn't have the opportunities I've had, I wouldn't be sat here right now about to go to the home Paralympics. People have to stop feeling sorry for Paralympians and think: 'Wow, these guys have got great opportunities, and they are good at it.'\"</p> <h2>The Challengers: introducing the three major rivals who will be going for gold against Jonnie Peacock</h2> <p><strong>Oscar Pistorius, South Africa </strong>The Blade Runner finally realised his Olympic dream earlier this summer, but now returns to his day job as one of the finest Paralympians of all time. He first announced himself to the world at the tender age of 17 in 2004, storming to a Paralympic gold and a bronze in the 200m and 100m, respectively. Since then he has claimed six world championship golds, three Paralympic golds, and three world records.</p> <p><strong>Jerome Singleton, USA </strong>The American has enjoyed some intriguing contests with Pistorius, and has even compared their rivalry to that of Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier. Singleton, a former intern at Nasa, will be confident of avenging his loss to Pistorius in Beijing, after handing the South African his first defeat in seven years at the 2011 world championships in Christchurch.</p> <p><strong>Arnu Fourie, South Africa </strong>As Jerome Singleton has proved, beating Oscar Pistorius is no mean feat, yet that is exactly what his fellow South African Fourie did at their country's trials this year. Fourie, who harboured dreams of being a rugby player until he lost his left leg below the knee in a motorboat accident, missed out on a medal in Beijing but is a serious contender for place on the podium this time.</p>",
  "<p>Luis Su\u00e1rez could see the No24 coming. The final whistle had just gone on the opening day of the season and the West Brom striker Peter Odemwingie was heading straight for him. Liverpool had lost 3-0, Su\u00e1rez had missed a couple of good chances, he was wound up, tense, and now this. But this time there was no confrontation. Instead there was comfort, counsel. \"He came over to me and told me that I should forget about all that other stuff,\" Su\u00e1rez says. \"He said that I'm a great player and that I should just worry about&#xa0;playing.\"</p> <p>Odemwingie is not the first person to tell him so. As Su\u00e1rez talks it is a recurring theme. There is a succession of men who have sought to shift his focus, going back a long way; men who have sought to channel his intensity, that competitive edge. \"If you had seen me before \u2026\" he says. There is a pause. He leans forward a little, elbows on the table, the sleeves of his training top pulled up high. His fingers move slowly as he talks, twisting the thin wedding ring on his right hand. Outside, through the glass doors that look across Liverpool's Melwood training ground, the rain hammers down. \"If you had seen me before,\" he continues, \"you'd realise that I used to be even worse.\"</p> <p>Luis Su\u00e1rez is not laughing. This is not a joke. Nor is it a plea for sympathy. And he is not fishing for compliments. It is just a statement, delivered evenly, like the majority of what he says. Yet this is not the self-congratulation of the reformed character. It is not the self-loathing either. He walks past the European Cup, past the rows and rows of boots and trainers, and up the stairs, taking a seat in an office overlooking the fields, still in his kit. He talks well; occasionally with eloquence and always with a self-awareness that is striking, even a little disarming. He says he wants to change, but doesn't want to entirely.</p> <p>The contradictions are many. Su\u00e1rez feels misunderstood, but this is no sob-story \u2013 he does not excuse, nor blame. He says he does not care what people say about him, but it is hard to avoid the conclusion that, somewhere inside, he does. He recognises himself, even as he does not. He says he is changing, because at times he has done himself and his team no favours, but he is not trying to be anything else. That, after all, is what got him this far. Without that competitiveness, without that edge, he would not be sitting here.</p> <p>Listening to him talk it is clear that while the image does not stand up, off the pitch at least, the way he plays is ultra-competitive, confrontational, win-at-all-costs. That brings a price.</p> <p>\"There are people who criticise me and that's normal because of the way I am on the pitch,\" he concedes. \"I get angry, I get tense. My wife says that if people reach conclusions as to what I am like based on what they see from me on the pitch they would say I am a guy who is always annoyed, always in a bad mood, they'd say what must it be like to live with me. There are two of me, two different people.\"</p> <p>Liverpool's new manager, Brendan Rodgers, insists that Su\u00e1rez is a good guy. Staff at the club describe him as quiet and professional. By his own admission, he first came to the Netherlands at 19 for \"love\": his then girlfriend, now his wife, lived in Europe and it was a way of starting a new life together. He talks proudly of how his daughter has been going to his games from the age of 15 days. On the pitch, though, he is transformed. Pressure and personality play their part in making him the player he is. So does the past.</p> <p>\"I have sacrificed so much to be where I am and fought so hard for it. I can't conceive of anyone wasting even five minutes in a game. I can't bear the idea of not trying to make the most of every single second. There are only three million people in Uruguay but there is such hunger for glory: you'll do anything to make it, you have that extra desire to run, to suffer. I can't explain our success but I think that's a reason.</p> <p>\"I played in the streets with my friends, barefooted. That was the way we lived. I never had the chance to say to my mother or father: 'I want these boots.' It's different in Europe. They have it easier. I saw that already in Holland. Kids of 17 or 18 years old were given cars already. Audis. Big cars. In Uruguay you don't have that. That can be an advantage: you don't give everything on the pitch if you have it all.\"</p> <p>Now Su\u00e1rez does. It makes no difference. He could have become comfortable but has not. The lessons are learned, the character forged. \"People say to me: 'How can you run so much, how can you suffer so much, how can a defeat hurt you so much?' Because there is so much effort and sacrifice behind it. I think Latin Americans value their position more than other players.</p> <p>\"And the pressure is greater than people realise. It makes you do things that you never imagined: eat more, eat less, act differently,\" he says. \"It does something to you. There have been games when I've said to myself: 'Why was I so stressed, why did I feel under such pressure when all I ever wanted was to play football?' As time passes, you realise you have to be more mature, that you have to take the games as just another game. Still give everything, still care, but not live it beforehand. Just play it. Don't get tense and wound up before the game.</p> <p>\"Coaches have told me I can help the team much more if I don't talk, if I don't moan. You reflect. Oscar Tabarez [Uruguay's manager], in a game against Peru in the qualification for the World Cup, told me I had let him down because he had placed a lot of trust in me, but he gave me another chance. I remember a game against Argentina too when he said to me: 'Luis, either you calm down or I take you off.' I could not carry on playing so crazily. In the second half, I focused better, I scored, I played better. Coaches who are intelligent see that. They warn you and that helps. Advice coming from the right people is always welcome.</p> <p>\"At Liverpool too. Steven [Gerrard] said to me during the game against United: 'Prove you're one of the best players in the world, that's what matters.'\"</p> <p>Talk turns to United; inevitably, it turns too to Patrice Evra and the eight-match ban that Su\u00e1rez received for racially abusing the Manchester United full-back in a game at Anfield last year. It is not something Su\u00e1rez particularly wants to dwell upon but it remains unresolved. He insists that he wants to move on, just as Odemwingie advised, but there are scars, a sense of injustice. He admits to feeling like a marked man, that he has felt singled out for criticism from the start. \"People spoke for the sake of speaking and didn't know what they were talking about,\" he says. \"Some people said what suited them. But that's in the past now.\"</p> <p>The word <em>negro</em> in Spanish does not mean \"negro\", and certainly does not mean the other n-word. In Uruguay, it is a word so widely used as to often be little more than mate. \"In Spanish, in Latin America, there's a way of speaking that is totally different. There are words you can say here that you could not say there and vice-versa. They would be taken in a totally different way,\" says Su\u00e1rez. But perhaps that is not even the point given that after three days of video evidence at a three-man Independent Regulatory Commission, lip readers produced no hard evidence that he said what he was accused of saying.</p> <p>But what is done is done. Move on as Odemwingie said. \"They punished me, I shut up and I forget it, I want to leave it now,\" he says. \"It's in the past. I'd prefer not to keep talking about it, otherwise it will never end.\"</p> <p>Easier said than done. For all the talk of Olympic spirit, he was booed by opposing supporters. \"What hurt me most was not that they whistled me but that they whistled the national anthem. I think that's a lack of respect. There's a clear example: the other day they were doing an interview with Usain Bolt and they started playing the American national anthem in the background, so he went silent. That's respect. That's what any normal person would do. But if they whistle me on the pitch when I have the ball that doesn't worry me.</p> <p>\"They are opponents and they want to have a go, that's it. They're not people who know me. It's just another stadium whistling. What Odemwingie said matters a thousand times more than some whistling.\" And yet, would he prefer it if fans were not on his back? \"Of course.\"</p> <p>He adds: \"What matters is the people I know and Liverpool always supported me. Whenever my wife or I came across people at the club or out in the street, they were good to us. That made us feel wanted and comfortable. That was important in deciding to continue. Last year good things happened as well as bad ones. The manager [Kenny Dalglish] always supported me, he kept putting me in the team, he kept faith in me always, the players defended me as well. The press might have talked but I always felt entirely backed by the people around me.\"</p> <p>Support was repaid with a contract renewal. Now Su\u00e1rez wants to leave all that behind and channel his energy, that intensity, into the football. He says he is determined to play in the Champions League. \"There were,\" he says, \"clubs that wanted me but my priority was always to stay and sign for Liverpool. I'm happy here and the manager said he wanted me. It is a dream. This has always been a big club in Uruguay. They were on television a lot and I used to play with Liverpool on the PlayStation: my team would have Gerrard and Torres.\"</p> <p>This is not just a new season, it feels like a new beginning. For the whole club and for Su\u00e1rez. Now, though, the responsibility is greater and for the first time there are questions being raised about his footballing contribution.</p> <p>He began his career as a winger and still does not refer to himself as a No9. That, though, is his job now. Eighty-one goals in 110 games for Ajax was an extraordinary return. For Liverpool he has scored 15 league goals since his \u00a322m transfer.</p> <p>Last season Su\u00e1rez hit the post eight times in the league \u2013 more than any other player. Bad luck? Over-thinking? Rodgers has told him there is no excuse; he just has to score. Shades of Bill Shankly: \"If you're in the penalty area and you're not sure what to do, stick it in the net and we can discuss the options afterwards.\"</p> <p>Su\u00e1rez prefers to think in terms of scoring bursts. \"In Holland I was lucky. It felt like everything went in. I could shoot with my shoulder or my tummy and it would go in. Now it's different. I understand that I have to score more goals than I am scoring. Maybe you try to be so precise to make sure that the keeper doesn't reach it that you end up hitting the post. Sometimes you hit it badly and it goes in. This year, maybe I'll try to hit it badly.\"</p> <p>If the responsibility is great, so is the optimism under Rodgers. Su\u00e1rez must score goals but he should not have to carry the team \u2013 he refers two or three times to feeling backed up by his team-mates. The new style is more his style. \"It suits me,\" he says. \"[Rodgers] knows I never stand still, that I am always moving, not a static, fixed striker, and he thinks that in the way we are going to play now I can do a lot of damage. He's a great coach. He has talent and you can see that he has studied in the way he plans his sessions. He talks constantly during training sessions and even speaks a bit of Spanish.\"</p> <p>Rodgers's approach sets him apart in England, Su\u00e1rez says. \"There are lots of teams here that aren't very well set up tactically. He's a coach that can see that if you can work tactically you can derive a lot of benefit from that; you can be different. If you're well organised, and you can play the ball, you can be successful.\"</p> <p>What does he mean by tactically poor? \"Well,\" he says, starting to signal positions on the table with his fingers. \"If I am playing centre forward <em>here</em> and I drop off the front into <em>this</em> area, both centre backs might come with me in England. And then a team-mate can go into the space and be one on one with the goalkeeper.\"</p> <p>Signalling to the right-back position, he says: \"Or, if you look at their line of four at the back and this guy always goes up the pitch and never comes back, then you can exploit that. Or if both full-backs go up, then you isolate the two centre-backs. When one full-back goes the other should stay and a midfielder drops in, but there are teams where that doesn't happen and you can take advantage. There are coaches who see that and coaches who don't. He sees it.\"</p> <p>Then there is Liverpool's commitment to possession. \"It is as the manager says: if all your defenders are very open and the goalkeeper is able to play a bit, it is impossible for the other team to get the ball off you. Then you have the midfielders who come in to get the ball off the back four and you play. His way of looking at the game is very intelligent and I think he's right. It's impossible for the other team to get the ball off you unless you make a simple mistake, a bad pass, an individual error.\"</p> <p>Against West Brom that was exactly what happened. But contrary to some critics, coaches such as Rodgers would argue that does not mean the model should be thrown out. Confidence is needed to play this way, and that takes time. The temptation when under pressure is just to hoof it; you need nerve to keep playing and you learn that and are better for it. As Su\u00e1rez points out, the hoof solves nothing either. \"For me, playing in England where all the centre-backs are tall and strong, the long punt up the pitch is no good to me. I need the ball on the floor.</p> <p>\"It is always a difficult thing to start with a new manager and a new team system but I think we played fairly well against West Brom. We knew it would be difficult. It's OK because we trust in the new manager and we are all very happy with him.</p> <p>\"We now press higher up the pitch and it has to be collective, organised. If I go to pressure the man, I lead the pressure but I need to be backed by Steven and by, if we go by the first game, [Fabio] Borini or Stewart [Downing]. And if we all pressure together, then it works. But it's not easy. You need to be clear in the idea, you need to work at it and try to adapt to it bit by bit. Then, with time, you will be able to impose it.</p> <p>\"Obviously, we're not going to play like Barcelona but the aim is similar. The manager has been studying in Spain, in Barcelona itself, and he was in Holland too, where they play good football. The idea is nice, my team-mates are very happy with it. The idea is to have the ball all the time, to pressure to get it back. Keep the ball, don't panic, look for the spaces at the right time, not play so fast, so desperately, as we did last season.</p> <p>\"It is a new season, we have a new coach, a new idea, a new style that is different to the one we had before and that's difficult. It will work, but it will take time.\"</p>",
  "<p>After my sons graduated and left home, my husband and I adjusted. It wasn't hard. Yes,&#xa0;we fondly recalled folding dryer-warmed T-shirts commemorating rock concerts and seeing our sons' stubbly faces as they stumbled out of bed after a hard night. But it&#xa0;was pretty damn roomy, that nest\u2026 until it&#xa0;wasn't empty any more.</p> <p>When we learned that, at 25, one son would be returning to live with us again, we expected his stay to last perhaps two months. The next month, he lost his job. After a few weeks, my husband and I found ourselves unable to zip our lips. Have&#xa0;you updated your CV? Looked online? While&#xa0;you're at it, could you please do your laundry? Clean up? Walk the dog?</p> <p>Months passed. Our son mentioned that he'd been offered a position, though the job sounded dull \u2013 and what was the rush to work again? Within his crowd, joblessness seemed to present no stigma and, given that he had few financial responsibilities, he was managing well, thank you very much. That's when my husband and I&#xa0;staged an intervention and, with a shove, our son accepted the job and moved out.</p> <p>A decade on, the number of adultescents living in their parents' homes looks like nothing less than a stampede of chicks coming home to roost, victims of a flatlined economy. According to the <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/family-demography/young-adults-living-with-parents/2011/young-adults-rpt.html\" title=\"\">Office for National Statistics</a>, nearly three million British adults aged 20-34 lived with their parents in 2011, up 20% since 1997. More than one million under-25s are now unemployed, and with the introduction of higher tuition fees, future students should expect to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2011/aug/12/student-debt-to-rocket-2012-freshers\" title=\"\">finish their degree with debts approaching \u00a360,000</a>, according to&#xa0;a survey published by the independent student guide <a href=\"http://www.push.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Push</a>. Lending institutions are&#xa0;shying away from offering mortgages and&#xa0;house prices have risen beyond the realms of possibility for many young people, who are often poorly paid if they actually work, or find that an unpaid internship has become the new entry-level job.</p> <p>These experiences may result in a severe hit to self-esteem; returning home to loving parents can sometimes soothe that wound. Many young adults, however, exist in a cloud of&#xa0;overconfidence, with an illusion of endless time. \"This is a more entitled generation than&#xa0;their parents' and grandparents',\" says <a href=\"http://www.drbilldoherty.org/\" title=\"\">William J Doherty</a>, professor of family social science. \"We're seeing young adults tethered to family in the sense that they live at home, but with no major responsibility to work as contributing members.\"</p> <p>Today's parents are likelier to treat young adults like pampered teens, reinvesting in dormant parenting roles, especially if their kids are floundering. \"The subliminal message that comes with all the giving and doing is, 'We don't think you can do it on your own,'\" says <a href=\"http://www.mariehartwell-walker.com/\" title=\"\">Marie Hartwell-Walker</a>, psychologist and mother of four adult children, two of whom came home to live with her and her husband.</p> <p>It's painful to recognise that biology's imperative is for younger generations to manage without parents, and that many life lessons must be learned alone. This truth is compounded by baby boomers' outrage at the&#xa0;very idea that they have to age, which sends an additional, if subliminal, message to&#xa0;young adults that there will always be time&#xa0;to get another degree, to break up with one more partner or employer, picking a direction, reversing it, spinning the dial again. If parents aren't \"old\" \u2013 and with hair colour and joint replacements, who doesn't want to pretend they're still 40? \u2013 then for adultescents, the years must be standing still. Parents of adult children need to step back so young adults can step forward. It's never too late for kids to grow up.</p> <p>\u2022 Sally Koslow is the author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Slouching-Toward-Adulthood-Observations-Not-So-Empty/dp/0670023620/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345127392&amp;sr=8-1\" title=\"\">Slouching Toward Adulthood</a>: Observations From The Not-So-Empty Nest (Viking).</p> <h2>Gareth Johnson, 38, lives with his parents, Carl&#xa0;and Eunice, and his nephew, Seth, 12, in&#xa0;Norbury, south London<br></h2> <p><strong>Gareth says:</strong> Apart from a year studying in Dundee and a few spells abroad last year, I've lived at home all my life. My mum and dad are ridiculously supportive. They've never broached the subject of me leaving. I'm unemployed \u2013 I got an MSc in forensic art a few years ago, but haven't found work in that area yet. I've applied for more than 300 jobs.</p> <p>Everything changed when my sister died suddenly six years ago. She was living at home, too, with her son, who is now 12. I had been umming and ahhing about moving out and that put a hold on things. It changed my whole perspective on life. I used to work in TV production design, and it made me want to do something more worthwhile, which is why I did my postgraduate degree.</p> <p>Mum and Dad are raising my nephew, Seth; I'm a sort of dad/uncle/brother rolled into one. They give him a really stable background, just like they did for me. You couldn't wish for better parents. I'm the fun element. Would I still be at home if it weren't for Seth? I don't know, but he doesn't keep me here. I'd prefer to get a job and my own place, and I'm sure Mum and Dad want me to as well.</p> <p>I sign on, so I don't pay any rent. After paying off my creative development loan, there's nothing left. We lead quite separate lives. I'm more of a&#xa0;night person: I go to bed around 3am and get up about midday. We eat together most evenings, but cooking is a bit contentious: my mum and dad don't eat the sort of stuff I like, so they tend to do the cooking. Dad does most of the cleaning, but I&#xa0;do my own laundry and clean up after dinner.</p> <p>Mum nags me, of course, about shaving stubble on the sink, leaving my beer-brewing tools around, hoarding towels. I think they've accepted that's what I'm like. I don't get any stick from mates \u2013 they've all done the back-to-home thing at some point. A lot are aspirational in what they want to do with their careers, like me. I&#xa0;love living at home because of the security and it's great seeing Seth grow up. But I hope I leave before him.</p> <p><strong>Carl says:</strong> When Gareth came back from Dundee, we all expected him to start on a new career and move out. He's been back nearly two years and it hasn't happened yet. We share his frustrations and disappointments \u2013 it's a difficult climate. We're supporting him in the best way we can. If we had the money to set him up on his own, we would. Some of our family think we're a bit too supportive and drop hints that Gareth might try to find a job. But we don't charge him rent because he can't afford to pay it \u2013 he's trying to pay off his loan.</p> <p>We do like having him around. He's handy round the house and although he has what you might call a limited repertoire of meals, he's brilliant at clearing away. Like any family member, he has good and bad points: he's always leaving the lights on, but he brews fabulous beer. He and Seth get on famously: they play football in the hall, just like Gareth did as a kid with his own uncles.</p> <p>After losing our daughter, Lisa, Gareth has become more precious to us. But we have an adult relationship with him now, not a parent/child one. He's still our son, and we love him to bits, but he's also an adult.</p> <h2>Michelle Nicoll, 27, and her husband David, 30, have been living with her parents, Jan and Keith Rutland, in Hatfield Heath, Essex, for 17 months</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395081687\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/23/1345709761044/Generation-boomerang-Mich-008.jpg\" alt=\"Generation boomerang: Michelle Nicoll, with husband David and parents Keith and Jan\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It feels as if our lives are on hold,\u2019 says Michelle Nicoll, with husband David and parents Keith and Jan. Photograph: Lucy Levene</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucy Levene</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br><strong>Michelle says:</strong> David and I had been renting for two years before we got engaged and realised we'd never be able to afford a wedding and a deposit for a house while wasting money on rent. We had no savings and though we didn't want a big wedding, we wanted all the family there. Our only option, as we saw it, was to move back in with my parents. Some people think we're mad, but I've always wanted marriage, a house and kids, in that order.</p> <p>My parents had always said we'd be welcome, and we'd joked about it, but it was depressing \u2013 I&#xa0;felt as if we were imposing, and that we'd failed. We'd started out as an independent couple, with our own routines and our freedom, and had gone backwards. We got married in May, but it feels as if our lives are on hold.</p> <p>The hardest thing is doing everything to my parents' routines. When we lived together, we did chores as and when we felt like it. Now we feel we have to wash up straight after dinner, or tidy up when they want us to. They don't go out a lot, so we have no time alone at home. We have a little area upstairs that we use, but it's so cramped with furniture, and our two cats, that it's hard to relax.</p> <p>Between us, David and I pay \u00a3225 a month in rent, which probably doesn't even cover food or electricity. My parents want us out sooner rather than later, and I'm sure they know if they charged us more, it would take us longer to save up for our deposit. We save about \u00a31,000 a month, and we've wiped out our bank loans and credit card debts.</p> <p>We had quite a bit of furniture, as we were renting a two-bedroom house. Some of it is in the garage, and the loft, and we bought a shed. We planned to be here for a year to 18 months, but I&#xa0;think we'll be here another six or seven months.</p> <p><strong>Jan says:</strong> We knew Michelle and David were in a&#xa0;bit of a mess and needed to save up for a deposit. We thought, if we don't help them out, there's no chance of them getting anywhere. We'd had a few years enjoying not having children at home, and spreading out, so it was hard condensing our stuff again. Michelle and I are very different and we have clashed, particularly in the kitchen. She likes things done properly, whereas I'm quite slapdash. They have two cats and it took our dog a while to get used to them. And we had to work out timings for the bathroom in the morning, as we've only one. It has been quite fraught on both sides.</p> <p>For their sake, mostly, I'm looking forward to when they move out and can get their lives in order. I'll miss them, but I'm looking forward to having our own space back. We're going to have people to stay again \u2013 we knocked that on the head when Michelle moved back in.</p> <h2>David Gardener, 35, has lived with his parents, Sue and Dennis, in Perth for the past 16 months<br></h2> <p><strong>David says:</strong> I was living with a girlfriend in Glasgow and we split up; I had nowhere else to go. I don't have a job at the moment. I'd always worked in the hospitality industry \u2013 as a chef, and doing restaurant and bar work \u2013 but decided to do a degree when I&#xa0;was 26, then a master's. I'd&#xa0;ideally like a job in social research or social policy, and must have applied for nearly 1,000 now. I'm even looking for catering work again, and I'm doing voluntary work for a local wildlife charity, which gets me out of the house.</p> <p>The biggest adjustment has been working round their routines, so I find it easier to do my own thing. They have an extension where I camp out and watch American dramas such as CSI, and sport. Mum tends to watch stuff like Poirot. I've tried to keep as much independence as I can: I do my own laundry, clean my own room, and help out as much as I can, mowing the lawn, hanging curtains. They're away this weekend, so I'm doing some painting and decorating as a thank you. They don't nag \u2013 they know I'm doing all I can to find a&#xa0;job, even if they don't understand the line of work.</p> <p>It's hard to meet women around here, mainly because I don't have many friends in Perth so I&#xa0;don't go out much. I have had a relationship since living here, but she was in Edinburgh and it didn't work out. I don't mind living here \u2013 I'm used to it now and do have a lot of freedom \u2013 but I haven't any other option. As soon as I get a job, I'll be off.</p> <p><strong>Sue says:</strong> We had a call saying, \"Help, I haven't told you but I'd moved in with this girl and she's thrown me out.\" He really didn't have any choice but to come and live with us. It's been a shock, as he's always worked. Even if he didn't like a job, he'd always find another one first before moving on. A&#xa0;few weeks ago, things were looking promising with one application, but apparently there were people with PhDs ahead of him in the queue.</p> <p>I really like having him at home \u2013 I haven't seen that much of him over the years. He's had one relationship since living here, but it didn't last. She lived in Edinburgh \u2013 his dad would never tolerate a girl staying the night, and he couldn't afford to go and see her all the time. I'd love him to meet someone but at the moment it's a no-no. I&#xa0;think he's a bit isolated here, but I'd never turf him out. He's my son, I'd do anything for him. <br><em>Interviews by Hannah Booth</em></p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/shirley-maclaine\" title=\"\">Shirley MacLaine</a> comes to the door in slippers and a tracksuit, clutching a fistful of hair and looking, at 78, like an only slightly older version of those famous 1960s roles of hers: gleeful, sharp-eyed, almost confrontationally scatty. We're at her pied-\u00e0-terre in Malibu \u2013 she lives most of the time on a ranch in New Mexico \u2013 a bungalow overlooking the ocean in a secure development popular with celebrities, she says, because of the anonymity; although, when she calls me a cab at the end of the interview, she says blithely down the phone, \"Hello, it's Shirley MacLaine\", then stands in the driveway, eating a cracker and waving at the driver as he turns in the drive.</p> <p>This autumn, MacLaine appears opposite <a href=\"http://film.guardian.co.uk/Player/Player_Page/0,,506355,00.html\" title=\"\">Maggie Smith</a> in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/downton-abbey\" title=\"\">Downton Abbey</a>, the kind of shark versus bear pairing TV execs only dream about and that, for incongruity, is right up there with the time Liz Taylor appeared in a Miss Marple. <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/downtonabbey/news/shirley-maclaine-cast/\" title=\"\">MacLaine will play Martha Levinson, Lady Cora's mother, sweeping in from New York to upset the household</a>. Or, as MacLaine puts it as we sit down in her living room, \"My character is not crass, but more emotionally democratic than the English. She goes over there to say, 'Rethink your attitudes about tradition!'\" She has known Dame Maggie for almost 40 years and what a delight it is, she says, to sit around on set all day, \"two senior citizens\", gossiping. There was one particular scene, a wedding in a church\u2026 hang on, who gets married?!</p> <p>\"Oh, I forget now.\" (MacLaine has the actor's habit of total amnesia concerning scenes she's not&#xa0;central to.)</p> <p>\"But Maggie and I are there in the scene. And we don't like to get up from our chairs; we just sit. And we must have sat for seven hours in this church. Just talking, talking.\"</p> <p>What about?</p> <p>\"Men. Health. Hair.\" Pause. \"One of her friends \u2013 I don't want to say who \u2013 one very famous friend of hers, has found a new lover.\"</p> <p>Oh my God, is it Dench?</p> <p>It's not Dench. How old is this person?</p> <p>\"A hundred and twenty. And we both wondered how this was possible. We're both divorced, so we talked about that. We talked about if we want a man in our lives again.\"</p> <p>And?</p> <p>\"I don't want to share that.\" She thinks for a moment. \"Put it this way: if a good-looking, elderly man had walked in just then... we would have still stayed there talking.\" MacLaine explodes with dirty laughter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395053958\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/22/1345649551800/Shirley-MacLaine-film-com-008.jpg\" alt=\"Shirley MacLaine film composite\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From right: with Michael Caine in Gambit (1966); in John Goldfarb, Please Come Home (1965); with \u00adPeter Sellers in Woman Seven Times (1967); with Jack Lemmon in The Apartment (1960).

She is very smart, of course, and inclined to pick up on stupid questions. She talks about celebrity in a way other celebrities do not \u2013 the insecurity, the neediness of her peers, the fact you cannot, in most cases, be an A-list actor without being at some level a nutcase. It amuses her to test people. For example, in among the clutter on her coffee table is a joke coffee cup with fake liquid spilling out of it that looks very real. MacLaine once put it on a chair and invited an estate agent who was trying to win business from&#xa0;her to sit down.</p> <p>\"She saw it and sat,\" says MacLaine. \"Didn't say&#xa0;anything.\"</p> <p>What, because you're famous and she didn't want to upset the talent?</p> <p>\"Exactly. That's how full of shit she was.\"</p> <p>She is the first to mock her own reputation. \"People think I'm nuts,\" is a common MacLaine refrain, which they certainly do, although the fact&#xa0;she acknowledges it softens the impression,&#xa0;so that all that business \u2013 the reincarnation, the crystals, the aliens \u2013 plays out more like an eccentric hobby than full on insanity.</p> <p>Above all, one is warned of her waspishness. Early on in our encounter, MacLaine says something mildly interesting about Downton \u2013 how the English cast members were too afraid to ask her any questions about Hollywood, although they obviously wanted to \u2013 news I receive, as one does in interviews, as if it is the most fascinating thing I have ever heard, putting my hand in front of my mouth in stark amazement. MacLaine drops the story and stares coldly at me.</p> <p>\"Poor dear,\" she says. \"You're suffering.</p> <p>\"No, I was just\u2026\"</p> <p>\"Hmm-mm.\" She is not interested in tolerating a rival performance.</p> <p>To this end, the thing she values most in life, she says, is honesty, for pragmatic as well as for moral reasons: the only way to be famous and not go mad, says MacLaine, is to hide in plain sight; to undermine the illusion of celebrity before anyone else can. This is both an honest approach and a contrivance to give the impression of honesty. MacLaine has been doing this a very long time.</p> <p>So anyway, Downton. \"They were gobsmacked,\" she says of the English cast. (MacLaine has picked up some British vernacular. To wit: \"They don't understand what a frigging hit they are!\")</p> <p>In one scene, they all sat around the table between takes stealing glances at her. \"They wanted to hear about Frank [Sinatra] and they wanted to hear about all my love affairs and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Wilder\" title=\"\">Billy Wilder</a> and all of that. But they never asked.\"</p> <p>They were shy.</p> <p>\"No,\" she says firmly. \"It's a question of etiquette. It's a question of don't pry. A lot of people have that reaction to me. Until they meet&#xa0;me and then they see, shit, I'll talk about&#xa0;anything.\"</p> <p>I would quite like to keep her off Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin and the Rolodex of old lag stories rolled out every time she is written about. Has it ever occurred to her that if she was British, she'd be Dame Shirley by now? MacLaine hoots with laughter. \"I was thinking about that! Do I&#xa0;have to be British?\"</p> <p>I think so; Canadian at a pinch. (MacLaine's mother was Canadian). I don't think you can be knighted if you're American.</p> <p>\"No, Elton John is knighted!\"</p> <p>He's British.</p> <p>\"Oh, of course he is. Well, that's too bad.\"</p> <p>It came as a great surprise to MacLaine's parents that out of their regular household in Arlington, Virginia \u2013 mother a drama teacher, father a professor \u2013 they produced two top-flight movie stars. \"It's startling to me!\" she says. \"I mean, where did this come from? I don't have an answer.\" She can't speak for her brother <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000886/\" title=\"\">Warren Beatty</a> (and for periods has not spoken to Warren; she found his womanising distasteful), but thinks the two of them were put in the position of \"fulfilling our parents unrealised dreams\". She says, \"Warren would probably have a different way of saying it. But that's what I feel.\"</p> <p>Her father had a degree in philosophy and psychology from <a href=\"http://www.jhu.edu/\" title=\"\">Johns Hopkins University</a>, but harboured dreams of \"running away to join the circus\". Her mother was, well, \"my mother was Canadian, so you never knew what she was thinking. Why is she bumping into the furniture and apologising to it?\" It was a repressed household, which MacLaine was eager to get away from, and did, early, to train as a dancer.</p> <p>Thank god for her dance training, she says. Billy&#xa0;Wilder yelling at her on the set of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053604/\" title=\"\">The Apartment</a> was nothing compared with the hell a&#xa0;choreographer puts a young dancer through. Dancers are ambitious but not competitive with others, MacLaine says.</p> <p>Oh, come off it, I say. Her airy I-don't-compete attitude is not, in a movie star of her longevity, terribly credible, and she laughs and admits her own friends pick her up on it.</p> <p>\"When I said I've never been competitive to <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000870/\" title=\"\">Kathy Bates</a>, she hooted with laughter and said&#xa0;are you out of your fucking mind, of course you are!\"</p> <p>Anyway, the point is, says MacLaine, even in her mid-20s - her superstar period - she was not&#xa0;not in a death match with other actors for roles. For a while, the roles came to her; she won&#xa0;an Oscar nomination for her role in The Apartment, opposite Jack Lemmon, and again for&#xa0;her role opposite Sinatra in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052218/\" title=\"\">Some Came Running</a>, as the hopelessly endearing Ginnie Moorehead. This was the decade in which she knocked around with Sinatra and Dean Martin, taking her cabaret act to Vegas, where the front few tables were always taken up by mobsters. (They thought she&#xa0;was cute, MacLaine says, because she was the&#xa0;only person who had the cheek to talk back to&#xa0;them.)</p> <p>The celebrity world has moved on since then. She is nostalgic for the days when stars knew how&#xa0;to wear their celebrity lightly. \"Those guys joked around with their power. And their celebrity. It was all a joke. It was a time before paparazzi. You&#xa0;know when you eat too many sweets and get&#xa0;diabetes? Paparazzi are the diabetes of materialistic culture.\"</p> <p>She looks delighted with this.</p> <p>\"That's a good line!\"</p> <p>She was having lunch with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/jennifer-aniston\" title=\"\">Jennifer Aniston</a> and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0857620/\" title=\"\">Justin Theroux</a> the other day, she says, and by the time they finished, there were paparazzi outside the restaurant. \"I felt so bad. I think the restaurant called them.\"</p> <p>She will have a tough time drumming up much sympathy here. From the civilian point of view, someone such as Aniston is assumed to be complicit in her own exploitation.</p> <p>\"I think Diana did. And there are people who get a kick out of manipulating and moulding and sculpting their public image. But I do not think that people like Jennifer and Justin do.\"</p> <p>What about someone like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/lindsay-lohan\" title=\"\">Lindsay Lohan</a>? She and MacLaine were slated to do a movie together but it didn't come together. They had a few meetings, though.</p> <p>\"And, you know, her conversation was 90% about her upbringing. Her parents. Now, she's also a master manipulator, and it's not hard to figure out I'm interested in all that stuff, so she was maybe using it. I don't know. I can't advise any of the young ones, because I don't know what their background was, but I would suggest that anyone who wants to be famous more than anything \u2013 there's a problem.\"</p> <p>Even if it coincides with real talent?</p> <p>\"Well, that's her. But...\" MacLaine sighs. \"Too&#xa0;much damage as a child.\"</p> <p>MacLaine talks a lot and with frankness in this kind of vein, about the people she has worked with and the damage the system has visited on them. I tell her I was reading her memoir the previous day.</p> <p>\"Which one?\" she asks sharply.</p> <p>My Lucky Stars.</p> <p>Aside from the chapter on what a nightmare it&#xa0;was working with Debra Winger on <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086425/\" title=\"\">Terms Of Endearment</a> (there's an extraordinary scene in the book in which MacLaine recounts how, between takes and to throw her off, Winger jumps&#xa0;on MacLaine and pretends to perform oral sex on her), the book purported to be franker than it actually was. \"There is a lot I've never told,\" she says, \"but that'll be for some of my friends after I'm gone.\"</p> <p>You have an unpublished manuscript in a safe somewhere?</p> <p>\"Yep.\"</p> <p>Really?</p> <p>\"Yes.\"</p> <p>With instructions?</p> <p>\"No. I'm not <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/jun/27/nora-ephron\" title=\"\">Nora Ephron</a>.\"</p> <p>And these things you've withheld?</p> <p>\"Are to protect other people. Not myself.\"</p> <p>What you take away from the book is a thorough analysis of the role played by insecurity in her line of work. \"You have to be talentedly insecure in order to be a good actress,\" she says. \"And then it's the director's job to make you more miserable and get a good take.\" MacLaine does not strike me as being terribly insecure. When I&#xa0;ask if she ever wonders if she's worth it, the money and the fame, she says, \"That never occurred to me. I said it when I won the Oscar: I&#xa0;deserve this. I really meant it.\"</p> <p>Which, paradoxically, isn't the best mentality for someone in her business. She says, \"I'm one of the ones who is still around and kind of unabashedly real about everything. But maybe I&#xa0;would have been a lot better actor if I had allowed myself not to understand who I am.\"</p> <p>You killed the mystery?</p> <p>\"Maybe.\"</p> <p>Like writers who say they won't go into therapy?</p> <p>\"Yes. Norman Mailer and I used to have this argument all the time. He said neurosis is absolutely necessary to being a good writer. And I&#xa0;said, no: I think you're more talented if you know who you are.\" She thinks for a moment. \"But I can't say that knowing who you are makes you less neurotic.\" The thing she would never do, she says, is \"invade my own vulnerable privacy. It's kind of a rip-off when you go to work and the director wants you to cry. I've had a don't-step-across-that-border thing about me. That's why I'm the sane one. I've never experienced these Hollywood stories.\" (She was never in rehab. When MacLaine was knocking around in the 1960s with all those big drinkers and drug-takers, she would excuse herself from the room. \"I'd say, I'll see you when you get done. That could be my dad's influence. His disciplinarian mentality.\")</p> <p>What would she do, then, if a director tried to manipulate her like that?</p> <p>\"They don't do that. They're afraid of me. They're afraid of my honesty. In case I go too far.\"</p> <p>From all this glib dismissiveness, you would think she had never had a problem in her life. But when MacLaine was in her 40s, she was broke, unemployed, going through a divorce with Steve Parker, the husband with whom she has a grown-up daughter and who, she has said in the past, transferred a great deal of money from her account to his. I can't imagine her zen attitude surviving this intact, and she does allow that during the fallow period \u2013 \"Those years when the phone doesn't ring and you have no jobs\" \u2013 she went through a certain amount of existential unhappiness. But really, the only thing that upsets her in life is unfairness, she says. What, such as her husband taking her money?</p> <p>MacLaine looks weary. \"A lot of the money was intended for good investments. And with the divorce, I said to his lawyer, he can have anything he wants. And he took nothing: $100,000. And $10,000 a year.\"</p> <p>But he'd taken your money already!</p> <p>\"Yes. But by the way, I was leading a very open life with many men, so he took some of that money and gave it to the woman he was mostly involved with.\"</p> <p>It was your money!</p> <p>\"I know. But without him I wouldn't have been protected enough to be sane. He was my guardian,&#xa0;my manager, my companion, my helpmate. He never said anything about all my relationships. It was an interesting open marriage.\"</p> <p>She has never remarried. Her daughter, Sachiko, grew up mainly with her ex-husband, then living in Japan, which was probably a good thing, MacLaine says. It kept her out of the Hollywood rat race. Although, rather brutally, she&#xa0;says, \"I think she's always secretly wanted to&#xa0;be in showbusiness. I don't know what that's like. I don't know what it's like not to have what I&#xa0;want.\" MacLaine shrugs. \"But then, I don't want&#xa0;very much.\"</p> <p>Actually there was something she wanted recently and didn't get, which was to be cast in the movie version of the hit Broadway play, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August:_Osage_County\" title=\"\">August: Osage County</a>. MacLaine campaigned for it, but it went to Meryl Streep. \"You get the routine, 'Well, we're not sure we can finance it...' They couldn't have financed it with me! They can&#xa0;with Meryl.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395053959\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/22/1345649736293/Shirley-Maclaine-in-Downt-008.jpg\" alt=\"Shirley Maclaine in Downton Abbey TV series\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As Martha Levinson, Lady Cora\u2019s mother, in the new series of Downton Abbey.

She has four potential movies in the works at the moment. She would like to do another series, if she could figure out a way to take the dog. We talk about class, again, and what happens when celebrities marry civilians, like Lady Sybil running off with the chauffeur.</p> <p>\"Which one's she again?\"</p> <p>The youngest one, with brown hair \u2013 don't worry about it.</p> <p>\"One of my best love affairs was with my driver,\" MacLaine says.</p> <p>Really?</p> <p>\"He was Canadian. We had the best time.\"</p> <p>Was your celebrity in the room with you?</p> <p>\"Sure. It was hard on him.\" She sighs. \"They want to be in it. They want to be you. There are two businesses in the world, Emma, two businesses: showbusiness and everybody else's business.\"</p> <p>If everyone wants to be famous, when you're famous, what do you want to be?</p> <p>\"First off, come and fucking stay on a movie set&#xa0;for a couple of days and see whether you like&#xa0;it. The question is why this needs to be acknowledged. There's a wrongness to it. Everybody wants to be famous, and it's because there's a spiritual vacancy. They try to find it with&#xa0;money, sex, religion. How are they going to&#xa0;fill that vacancy? And they try to do it with dreams of&#xa0;fame.\"</p> <p>The Scientologists have tried to recruit MacLaine many times, \"because they know I&#xa0;believe in reincarnation\". She bats them away. \"I'm not sure what they really believe. Much of it is secret.\"</p> <p>Anyway, so why didn't it work out with the&#xa0;driver?</p> <p>\"He was too intimidated by my fame. I don't know how any guy could have put up with me, really. Honestly.\" This in spite of the fact she says she is very undemanding. Every assistant she has had, MacLaine says, has told her she is the most low-maintenance person they have worked with.</p> <p>So what was there to put up with?</p> <p>\"Where?\"</p> <p>In your relationships? What drives them away?</p> <p>\"Oh, that. That I don't need 'em.\"</p> <p>It's a couple of years off yet, but for her 80th birthday MacLaine would like to fly a bunch of friends to New Mexico for dinner. This will separate the wheat from the chaff, she says. When you live out there, you really find out who&#xa0;your friends are. At a recent <a href=\"http://www.afi.com/\" title=\"\">American Film Institute</a> event in her honour, she sat next to Meryl Streep, who she considers a great friend, (\"She really looked after me. She would turn around to people who were bothering me and say, 'She's eating, do you mind?'\"), and her other great friend, Julia Roberts.</p> <p>She gives the impression of knowing everyone. Tom Cruise? \"He's a darling guy. I think he's embraced, for him, other realities that work.\" Bill&#xa0;Clinton? \"Sure. He reminded me of a long walk we took on the beach when I was campaigning for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_McGovern\" title=\"\">McGovern</a>.\" She smiles. \"He has complete command of being loved.\"</p> <p>She is loyal to her friends, she says; her agent is&#xa0;80 years old and has been with her since her 20s. He knows where \"all the money\" for the independent movies is, which is useful at her age,&#xa0;since she hasn't much hope of a blockbuster. She lives a relatively simple life, going to bed at 2am and up at 9am. \"I'm on Vegas time. I've been on Vegas time most of my life.\"</p> <p>We go into the kitchen and MacLaine opens a&#xa0;jar of peanut butter and starts spreading it on crackers. She butters a cracker for herself, and one for me; one for her, one for me. Then two for&#xa0;her and one for me. She will not relinquish the&#xa0;jar.</p> <p>She describes a scene in Downton, which she came up with herself and which <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0271501/\" title=\"\">Julian Fellowes</a> allowed her to keep in. It is her favourite scene in the series; MacLaine's character decides to serenade Maggie's with a rendition of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgvDariuAN0\" title=\"\">Let Me Call You Sweetheart</a>. When the scene was explained to Maggie, the actress said to her American co-star, \"You know what I'm going to do, dear, I'm going to fall off the chair when you start singing.'\" MacLaine rolls her eyes. \"I said OK, whatever. Then Maggie said, 'No, I think I'll fall asleep.' But actually, what she did when I started singing was to go all cuddly and coy. And then I kiss her hand.\" Between these two old war horses, it was, says MacLaine, the sweetest moment in the world.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong>Downton Abbey returns to ITV1 next month.<strong> </strong></p>",
  "<p>Laptops are amazing value \u2013 you can get a decent machine for \u00a3350. This is less than the cost of many smartphones and tablets, and it's probably less than you spend overall on coffee or other small treats. Over three years, it comes out at 32p per day. Going for a slower \u00a3300 system will cost you more in wasted time than the 5p-a-day saving.</p> <p>Prices are only this low for mainstream, general-purpose laptops, where high-volume sales and cut-throat competition drive down prices. These machines are fine for email and web browsing, playing DVDs, editing photos, running applications such as Microsoft Office, and playing basic games. They are less suitable for heavyweight tasks such as editing high definition videos, and they are not suitable for running state-of-the-art games at high frame rates.</p> <p>There are dozens of models in the \u00a3300-\u00a3500 price range, and thousands of minor variations: different processors, memory sizes, hard drives, and so on. However, most of the differences are cosmetic. As long as you get the basic specification right you can decide for yourself whether you like the keyboard and screen, and whether it feels reasonably well made. (Manufacturers offer better-looking, better-made laptops at higher prices.)</p> <p>Almost all these laptops have 15.6in screens showing 1366 x 768 pixels, 4GB of memory, built-in Wi-Fi, a webcam (usually 0.3MP, sometimes 1.3MP), DVD and 320GB hard drives, USB 2.0 ports, and SD memory card slots. They should all be running 64-bit Windows Home Premium. Not all have built-in Bluetooth or USB 3.0 ports, so check if you need these.</p> <p>Some have more memory (6GB or 8GB), but 4GB is enough. Some have larger hard drives (500GB or 750GB) that can store more data such as movies and photos.</p> <p>The most critical choice is the processor, which is the engine that makes it run. It also has the biggest influence on the price. Intel uses a BMW-style naming system which has the Core i7 at the top, then goes down through the Core i5 and Core i3 to Pentium and Celeron chips. These are not really old Pentiums and Celerons, it's just a naming convention to signify that these processors are cheaper and less powerful.</p> <p>In the \u00a3300\u2013\u00a3350 range the best you generally get is a Core i3-2330M or 2350M, where the bigger number signifies a faster chip. (The M stands for mobile. Laptop processors use less power and run slower than desktop versions, to reduce heat and give better battery life.)</p> <p>In my view you should not settle for anything less than a Pentium B940, B950 or preferably a B960 processor. I think laptops with Celeron chips are too slow. Cheap AMD chips, such as the C-50, E-240 Fusion and E2-1800 Brazos are even slower than Celerons.</p> <p>If you see a mainstream laptop that looks like a bargain it's probably running one of these, and isn't. If in doubt, look up Notebook Check's table, <a href=\"http://www.notebookcheck.net/Mobile-Processors-Benchmarklist.2436.0.html\" title=\"\">Comparison of Mobile Processors</a>. The Core i3-2330M is in 86th place while the E-450 is 377th and the E-240 is 516th. Some Intel Atom netbook chips come higher than that.</p> <p>One catch is that Intel brings out new chips every year, and newer is better. Today's Core i3 may be faster than last year's Core i5 or a Core i7 from 2010. However, last year's Core chips, codenamed \"Sandy Bridge\", are still worth buying.</p> <p>When it comes to brands South Korea's <strong>Samsung </strong>and China's <strong>Lenovo</strong> are competing hardest for this market, and both are growing rapidly. Samsung is also the world's biggest mobile phone company, sells Android tablets, and makes chips, screens and other components for Apple. Lenovo took over <strong>IBM</strong>'s PC division in 2005. It also sells the upmarket IdeaPad and prestigious ThinkPad ranges for those willing to flash a bit more cash.</p> <p>The American giants, <strong>HP</strong> and <strong>Dell</strong>, are seeing PC volumes decline as they aim to sell more upmarket, and more profitable, lines. The main Japanese competitors, <strong>Sony</strong> and <strong>Toshiba</strong>, both do high-end laptops better than low-end ones, though <strong>Fujitsu</strong> has some good cheap laptops if you can find them. Taiwanese giants, <strong>Asus</strong> and <strong>Acer</strong>, are still strong in netbooks but trying to innovate their way out of the bargain basement, with mixed results. Either way, all these brands are worth your consideration.</p> <p>Bearing all that in mind, here are my top three \u00a3350 laptop picks:</p> <h2><strong>Samsung RV520</strong><br></h2> <p>This is a well-established model with a good isolated keyboard (the keys are spaced apart) and a decent screen. It's also not bad looking, by the standards of its class. For \u00a3349.99 (Amazon's price, reduced from \u00a3449.99), you get a 2.20GHz Intel Core i3-2330M with 4GB of memory and a 500GB hard drive. For alternative sources of supply and prices, search for NP-RV520-A07UK. All round, the RV520 is great value and a pretty safe bet. Samsung also offers a somewhat nicer Series 3 laptop (NP300E5A-A01DX) with a Core i3-2350 for a bit more cash: \u00a3411.42.</p> <h2><strong>Lenovo G570</strong></h2> <p>The black and businesslike G570 and G580 models are mainstream notebooks to the max. They are available with an unusually wide range of processors and drives at prices from less than \u00a3300 to more than \u00a3500. The keyboard is above average for the class, with dished keys, perhaps benefiting from IBM's decades of expertise. <a href=\"http://www.saveonlaptops.co.uk/Lenovo_G570_1189691.html\" title=\"\">Saveonlaptops</a> sells a G570 with a Core i3-2350M (slightly nippier than the 2330M) and a 500GB hard drive for \u00a3349.99, or search for M51BHUK. The site also offers the same machine with 8GB of memory for \u00a320 more (M51DQUK), or with the processor downgraded to a Pentium B950 for \u00a330 less (M58FJUK).</p> <h2><strong>Asus X54C</strong></h2> <p>Typically, the company promotes this laptop's innovative motherboard technology and advanced cooling system, which the average buyer with \u00a3350 doesn't care about. The X54C does perform well, and it has a fast USB 3.0 port, but it's not particularly good looking, and I think both the RV520 and G570 have better keyboards. Asus gets the X54C into the sub-\u00a3350 market by using slower, cheaper processors, such as the Pentium B960 (\u00a3310.95 at Amazon, reduced from \u00a3349.99) and Celeron B815 (avoid). However, you can get the X54C-SX078V with a 2.3GHz Core i3-2350 processor, 6GB of memory and a 320GB hard drive for \u00a3349.99 from <a href=\"http://www.dabs.com/products/asus-x54c-sx078v-i3-2350-2-3ghz-6gb-320gb-dvdsm-15-6--w7hp-87R1.html\" title=\"\">Dabs.com</a>. Asus says it is about to launch a stylish new <a href=\"http://www.asus.com/Notebooks/Versatile_Performance/X501A/\" title=\"\">X501A version</a> that answers these questions, with an Intel Core i3 and no DVD drive for \u00a3349. It says stock arrived last week and \"will appear online any day now\" and at PC World and Currys.</p> <p>This isn't an exclusive list and you might do a bit better by shopping around. You could certainly do a lot worse.</p>",
  "<p>Press the bright yellow \"check prices\" button on <a href=\"http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/\" title=\"\">TripAdvisor</a> at your peril. Suddenly your screen is blasted with hotel booking websites jockeying for your attention, all promising \"best price guaranteed\" or \"we match the price or your first night is free\". But the result of this competitive hubbub? Nearly every site appears to offer the same price and you end up wondering why you should bother trawling through so many pop-ups.</p> <p>But, maybe, it's not that surprising that the price \"choice\" offered on TripAdvisor, the world's biggest hotel review site, can seem so limited. When the competing results flash up from Hotels.com, Expedia.co.uk and Venere.com, they are within a few pence of each other because \u2026 well, the same company owns Hotels.com, Expedia and Venere. So it's virtually pointless obtaining separate quotes.</p> <p>For example, try booking a Holiday Inn for two nights in Amsterdam this autumn. The TripAdvisor \"check prices\" button told me it would be \u00a3170.64 at Expedia, \u00a3170.64 at Venere and \u00a3171 at Hotels.com.</p> <p>To be fair, TripAdvisor's \"check prices\" button doesn't take you just to the sites of one reservations company. For instance, it nearly always shows offers by Booking.com, the biggest hotel reservation site and deadly competitor to Expedia.</p> <p>So what did Booking.com offer on the two nights in Amsterdam? Er, \u00a3170.63. Or 1p cheaper. That's competition for you.</p> <p>There is no suggestion of active collusion between the competing websites to offer near identical prices. That would be illegal. But behind the lookalike prices is a practice that has become standard in the industry \u2013 \"rate parity\". The big sites pressurise hotels to offer the same price, letting them advertise as the \"cheapest\" \u2013 and prevent smaller competitors from undercutting.</p> <p>This week the issue hit the US courts with Expedia, Booking.com plus numerous other sites and big hotel chains (such as Hilton and IHG, owners of Holiday Inn) accused of conspiring to fix prices. Travel sites \"created the illusion\" consumers could seek out the best deals, Steve Berman, an attorney for the plaintiffs, told <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/21/uk-hotels-lawsuit-idUSLNE87K00W20120821\" title=\"\">Reuters</a>. \"The reality is that these illegal price-parity agreements mean consumers see nothing but cosmetic differences and the same prices on every site.\"</p> <p>The Office of Fair Trading has also accused the sites of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/jul/31/expedia-booking-hotel-deals-investigated-oft\" title=\"\">infringing competition law</a>, helped by evidence from <a href=\"http://www.skoosh.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Skoosh</a>, a small UK online travel agent that has campaigned on the issue.</p> <p>The major booking sites and hotel groups vigorously contest both the US lawsuit and the OFT action, and argue rate parity is not anti-competitve. But if the OFT rules against them, the fines could be potentially up to 10% of their turnover.</p> <p>The lesson? Buying over the internet doesn't automatically mean you'll obtain the best price. And from my own \u2013 admittedly limited \u2013 research, always try the hotel's own website first. I'm off to Croatia (<em>pictured</em>) in September. The hotel I'm considering was quoted at \u00a3464.50 on Booking.com, \u00a3463.05 on Expedia, \u00a3463.00 on Hotels.com, \u00a3463.55 on Venere \u2013 and \u00a3359 on its own site.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 27 August to correct a sentence that stated that TripAdvisor and Expedia were part of the same company. In December 2011 TripAdvisor was spun out of Expedia and is now a separately quoted company. </p>",
  "<h2>Christine Assange, mother<br></h2> <p>Julian was brought up to try to put himself in other people's shoes. There were very strong values: you didn't lie. You treated other people with compassion. If we saw a drunk on the street, we stopped to see if he was OK. If Julian got into a&#xa0;dispute with another child, I would never take his side just because he was my son.</p> <p>Jules has always been extremely interested in finding the truth, no matter what the subject \u2013 medicine, environment, nature, physics. One thing you might not know about him is that as a child he used to play a mean blues harp. He was also extremely physically adventurous. Someone asked the other day if he'd like going to live in Ecuador, and I said one of the things he'd love about it is the climbing. When he was a little boy, he used to make rafts on the river. He was always exploring in the bush. At one point, when he was about 24, he took off into the Tasmanian wilderness with just a knife and pitted himself against nature to see if he could survive out there. The idea of Julian being this nerd behind a computer is completely wrong.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamesball\" title=\"\">James Ball</a>, former WikiLeaks staffer<br></h2> <p>Virtually everyone has a Julian they want to see \u2013 either a visionary hero of the free speech movement, or a paranoid, narcissistic creep who's&#xa0;a danger to civilised society. The reality would satisfy neither side.</p> <p>He's an incredibly driven man, with an impressively keen intellect. He also has, on rare occasions, a disarming sense of humour, sometimes even self-deprecating.</p> <p>Of course, here comes the inevitable \"but\". The&#xa0;bad sides of Julian's personality are as exaggerated as the good. His self-certainty and drive break through to the point of arrogance. His&#xa0;behaviour can be erratic, and he's not particularly considerate of those around him. As his online nickname \"Mendax\" suggests, he is quite happy to lie in the interest of what he sees as the greater good.</p> <p>But the worst qualities Assange displays are not really his fault. Even before the huge storm caused by the embassy cables, he tended towards the paranoid. Imagine seeing senators, commentators and more discussing your every move, calling you a terrorist, threatening you, with that predisposition. The result is a heady mix of paranoia, a predisposition to self-interest. A willingness to manipulate the truth and a belief that what you're doing is right is a potent and dangerous mix \u2013 and it's what's been driving Assange, and the chaos that follows in his wake, for almost two years now.</p> <h2>Iain Overton, editor of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism<br></h2> <p>I first met Julian when he invited the Bureau to scrutinise the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq-war-logs\" title=\"\">Iraq War Logs</a>. From the start, he made an impression. He gave perhaps the most wooden statement I've ever seen to CNN and then, as the camera turned off, transformed into a&#xa0;warm, personable man.</p> <p>A man who put himself in danger by exposing the US's secrets would also take delight in attempts to protect himself. Whether it was casually taking off his bulletproof vest in a restaurant, or appearing at the Bureau's offices with dyed hair, you never knew if he actually believed these safety measures worked or were just a bit of showmanship.</p> <p>Despite being an expert in secrecy, he talks unguardedly and freely when you are alone with him. And he can show an often sensitive and playful manner. Other times \u2013 like when debating what names should be redacted from the Wikileaks data \u2013 he could be judgmental and reluctant to hear the alternative view.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alanrusbridger\" title=\"\">Alan Rusbridger</a>, Guardian editor<br></h2> <p>In his unapproved and ghosted autobiography, Assange gives a colourful account of a marathon eight-hour meeting we had in the run-up to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-us-embassy-cables\" title=\"\">publication of the State Department cables</a>. Some of it was accurate \u2013 though I can't personally testify as to whether my eyes were, as he describes, \"rolling around the room like marbles on a pogo stick\". They may have been.</p> <p>The meeting took place in tense circumstances. The massive cache of cables, into which we had put months of work, had leaked from a former Wikileaks associate to a freelance journalist. It looked as if all our time and effort might come to nothing. And Assange was refusing to have any more dealings with the New York Times unless the paper's then editor, Bill Keller, promised to publish a front-page apology for having published a not wholly flattering profile of the WikiLeaks founder. We'd been told that Assange had begun, behind our backs, to talk to other American publishers.</p> <p>The eight hours began angrily. Assange, who had brought two lawyers with him, did a lot of shouting and accusing. The louder the shouting, the more mannered and Dickensian his language became. He repeatedly accused us of not being \"gentlemen\". My eyes may well have been rolling. I did my best to lower the temperature. He gradually went off the boil.</p> <p>We took a break and reconvened. Shouty Assange was now Strategic Assange. We would cooperate, after all. The snowy-haired Australian spoke deliberately. I remember thinking that, in a different life, he could have been a CEO or COO. He was intelligent, calm and incisive.</p> <p>All was going so well. We broke for a meal, during which he was witty and did his best \u2013 it felt as if was difficult for him \u2013 to make conversation. He was almost charming.</p> <p>And then, just as suddenly, he switched back to Shouty Assange. There was no deal. Keller must apologise. He would have nothing to do with us. It was now 1am. I rang Keller, knowing in advance what his answer would be. Assange ranted at his refusal to apologise. On his way out into the night an hour later \u2013 still no deal \u2013 he muttered a veiled threat at the Guardian's reporter who had worked most closely with him, David Leigh.</p> <p>The next morning there was a deal. I didn't have many more personal dealings with him. He disappeared from view (we later learned, to Norfolk) and communicated only sporadically through encrypted messaging until he fell silent altogether. But in that eight hours there was a microcosm of the man \u2013 in all his brilliance, paranoia, obstinacy and dysfunctional fury.</p> <h2>Peter Graham, school friend<br></h2> <p>He was a blond kid, shoulder-length hair, brought up with an alternative lifestyle. At the time, <a href=\"http://www.goolmangar-p.schools.nsw.edu.au/\" title=\"\">Goolmangar school</a> was made up of a lot of kids from dairy families and Jules was, to a degree, the odd one out. There weren't too many broken families back in the early 80s. He was not an outgoing sort of child. Didn't go out of his way to make trouble. I would say that he was always the sort of kid who stood behind. We used to play Red&#xa0;Rover and British Bulldog, and Jules was always one of the last to run.</p> <h2>Daniel Matthews, university friend<br></h2> <p>Julian and I studied mathematics at the University of Melbourne. We were both in the maths student group. It was fun, nerdy stuff. I've always found him witty, intelligent and eclectically knowledgeable. He is passionately committed to justice and the free flow of information and ideas. He has suffered great personal costs as a result.</p> <p>I've often heard it remarked in the press that Julian has some idiosyncrasies. The people who make such remarks tend not to have hung around mathematics departments very much.</p> <h2>Vaughan Smith, housed Assange&#xa0;for more than a year when he was on bail<br></h2> <p>Julian is somebody who will give you a surprising amount of time if he gets into a conversation. But other times you could walk past him and he wouldn't even know you were there because he was so transfixed with his computer. He would work late into the night. I get up early and go to bed early, but he's the opposite. A lot of people from a lot of different countries came through the hall to visit him. A couple of Australians brought rather a lot of Vegemite. He and his guests used to enjoy trying alcohol from different parts of the world. Julian would enjoy the occasional cigar, but it was difficult for him to smoke them because he had to stay in the house for fear of breaking his bail conditions.</p> <p>It wasn't always easy having him there, but I'm not attributing the difficulty to him, rather to having someone in the house all that time. And most of the complaints weren't really about Julian, they were about the people who'd come through the house to see him. There was an of average five to seven people staying at one time \u2013 people who wanted to see Julian. By giving him bail, I was therefore opening my door to a lot of other people. But we adjusted to that and we had a really good housekeeper who made it all happen. Julian did do some chores. He used to collect wood and eggs sometimes.</p> <p>I have four daughters and a son, who got to know&#xa0;Julian. He got on particularly well with my five-year-old. He used to give her sweets and things like that. I've got a photo of him cutting up a pumpkin with the girls all dressed up for Halloween. He fitted in with a family, although I&#xa0;wouldn't describe him as a family man.</p> <p>You can tease Julian, but he usually falls out with people who are themselves very strong characters. They will blame him and he will blame them.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/heather-brooke\" title=\"\">Heather Brooke</a>, journalist <br></h2> <p>The first time I met Assange, he was convinced a&#xa0;sniper was targeting him through the windows of a conference centre. A few hours later, he was happily typing in front of the same windows. I&#xa0;asked why he believed he was a target. \"I can't tell you,\" he said. Then, five minutes later, he did.&#xa0;He told me I should come to Washington DC for a press conference. Why? I can't tell you. Again, five minutes later, he told me about the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rXPrfnU3G0\" title=\"\">Collateral Murder video</a>.</p> <p>Assange attributed his drive to his first experience with power as a young man (hacking into the email of a Pentagon general). I said maybe I liked investigating politicians' expenses because that had been my first big investigation as a student. \"No, it's different when you're a young man.\" Can't women be driven the same way? \"No, they're not.\" It was a definitive statement, no supporting evidence needed.</p> <p>I followed up with requests to interview him for my book. I received florid emails such as, \"I&#xa0;will have you, Heather, of course I will. But let us be messiahs to generation WHY, not a bunch of ageing hacks looking for a pension... regards from intrigue hotel... I have more interesting adventures for you...\"</p> <p>When he suddenly turned up in London, he wanted me to put him up and act as some sort of mother surrogate. \"I have a fever. I'm not sure yet if it's going up or down,\" he told me. \"I need some mothering. Someone to make me chicken noodle soup and bring me cookies in bed.\"</p> <p>I later heard from two other women who said Assange pulled the same \"poor little lost boy\" trick on them in an attempt to finagle his way into their homes. I said that was not how I conducted interviews. He complained that I didn't have a maternal instinct, adding in drama-queen fashion: \"I have two wars to stop.\"</p> <p>I replied: \"Yeah, it's a tough life being a messiah.\" His response left me speechless: \"Will you be my Mary Magdalene, Heather? And bathe my feet at the cross.\"</p> <h2>J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Zimmermann, friend and founder of <a href=\"http://www.laquadrature.net/\" title=\"\">La Quadrature du Net</a>, a group defending freedoms online<br></h2> <p>When we first met in 2009, Julian struck me as one of the brightest minds I had ever encountered. He has a deep understanding of technology and its importance for building better societies, where citizens are empowered rather than controlled. He has certain characteristics that you find only in very technical people and some people with Asperger's syndrome. He is very focused, and when he's in front of a computer screen it can be difficult to get his attention. He is very self-confident, which is a good quality most of the time, but is why he needs his friends sometimes to introduce some doubt into his mind. You have to learn how to argue with him and push your opinions through by being very persuasive. People criticise him for having a great ego. Of course he has \u2013 he wouldn't be doing such crazy things without a great ego \u2013 but I believe that his sense of the general interest is far greater than his ego.</p> <p>Julian is quite a nomadic person. He is used to travelling a lot, and having no physical attachments. For that reason, I imagine being in the Ecuadorian embassy will be hard for him. But in other ways he will cope fine. He has a sharp sense of humour, which can be very cynical and dark. I've seen him sleep on couches and under tables, and unless the people around him force him into the shower, he might not change his clothes for days. I do the same when I'm immersed in work that I think is more important than the smell of my armpits.</p> <p>When the Sweden story first broke, I told Julian, \"If you've done something wrong, you'll pay for what you did, but for me it won't change who you are and what you have achieved.\" With WikiLeaks he has brought global attention to whistleblowing. He has shown that digital technologies can empower people by exposing the wrongdoings of institutions. People who criticise him based on personality traits should take a better look at what he has achieved.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/johnpilger\" title=\"\">John Pilger</a>, journalist and friend <br></h2> <p>I've known Julian Assange from the beginning of his extraordinary struggle in London. What struck me straight away was his fearlessness, though courage is a better word. By standing up to the most rapacious forces in the world today, and telling people in many countries what the powerful say and do behind their backs, he's made enemies of a kind journalists should wear as a badge of honour, but rarely do. The jealousy and envy he attracts often come from those aware of their own collusion with power and unforgiving of one who refuses to join their incestuous club. Personally, I find him the best of company: visiting him at the Ecuadorean embassy or in long phone conversations, often in the early hours of the morning, we share a similar black humour. The other night, we mined Joseph Heller's Catch-22. I took him over the movie, along with Dr Strangelove and Borat. Given his restless energy, his spirits are remarkable in the circumstances; and he's fortunate to have the support of a group of unflagging, thoroughly impressive people, not least his mother, Christine. All power to him.</p> <h2>Sarah Saunders, friend, who put up the majority of his bail<br></h2> <p>Julian stayed at my house from Christmas of last year until he left for the embassy. If I had to choose one attribute of his, it would be that Julian is very inquisitive. His ability to ask incisive and interesting questions is compelling, and it's why he has been effective in his work.</p> <p>Julian likes food and wants to know all about what he's eating (as a chef and lifetime foodie, I like this about him, too), even if he appears to be distracted by his computer or playing with my Jack Russell when he should be at the table to eat! He is very scientific about his cooking. He made a very good poached egg, which not everyone can achieve.</p> <p>I'm a bit of a night bird, so it was no problem for me that he liked to work at odd hours. We'd chat across the dining room table doing work at 2am.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Keller\" title=\"\">Bill Keller</a>, former editor, New York Times<br></h2> <p>I've never actually met Julian Assange. All of our conversations have been telephonic \u2013 including one where he hovered like the Great and Powerful Oz, via Skype, over a stage in Berkeley where yet another panel was pondering the meaning of WikiLeaks. All of our conversations, including that one, consisted mainly of Julian scolding The New York Times and me personally for not playing by his rules, for failing to recognise the supreme righteousness of his cause, and for portraying him in our pages as a complicated and controversial figure. \"Where's the respect?\" he demanded plaintively in one call. \"Where's the respect?\"</p> <p>Short of practicing Freud without a licence, I can't pretend to reconcile the many contradictions of Julian. He is indignant at the long delays in due process afforded Bradley Manning, but unwilling to submit himself to the due process of Sweden \u2013 or the United States, should it come to that. (If it does, I firmly believe he should enjoy the full protection of the First Amendment.) A champion of free press (during his Evita moment on the balcony of Ecuador's embassy, he deplored Russia's hamhanded punishment of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/pussy-riot\" title=\"\">Pussy Riot</a>), he accepted a TV gig sponsored by Putin's Kremlin, and has become soulmates with the press-gagging Ecuadoran president. He is the leader of an organisation that wants to be regarded as a beacon of truth, but boasts of fabricating juvenile hoaxes.</p> <p>Perhaps the ultimate and irreconcilable contradiction, though, was his yearning \u2013 \"Where's the respect?\" \u2013 to possess both the adulation of the angry disaffected and the serious regard of the established.</p> <h2>Mark Stephens, former Assange lawyer<br></h2> <p>He has an encyclopedic knowledge \u2013 and I mean that in the true sense of the word - of current affairs. He can talk to you about any particular country of the world with as much detail and knowledge and insight into the nuances of politics and current affairs as you and I can speak about British politics. He really does get a mixed reaction from people. He a person about whom myths grow easily and perhaps over readily. There are a lot of apocryphal stories \u2013 stories like he doesn't flush the toilet or doesn't wash \u2013 all of which don't ring true to anyone who has been in close proximity.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/ken-loach\" title=\"\">Ken Loach</a>, film-maker who put up bail<br></h2> <p>I was contacted by a mutual friend when the court case arose and he was going to be arrested. I met him a couple of times and again in the embassy. He was very keen for some human contact, some conversation that wasn't about Julian Assange. We chatted about politics generally and current affairs. He's a very interesting thoughtful lad. He'd gone from house arrest to another confinement. As we went in, you could see the massed ranks of police and people watching nearby. That wasn't a figment of his imagination. He was good company. We laughed about things, shared our feelings of dismay at the way certain people you'd have expected to have stood up for him have behaved. I took him some films, one or two of mine, and some others as well. He was quite low key, relaxed&#xa0;and friendly.</p> <h2>Dr Suelette Dreyfus, author and journalist<br></h2> <p>Julian and I worked on the book Underground, which was about a group of computer hackers in the 1980s and 90s. He'd go off to research something and would dig and dig until he had unearthed even the most obscure source. I've met very few journalists who are as driven. He'd ring at midnight or 1am. He didn't own a watch. He's always been about content, not constraints. That's rare. When I was in the midst of writing a chapter, he'd call up and say: \"Don't self-censor when you write!\" It was his catch-cry. Even then, his philosophy was to get the facts out there and let the reader decide.</p> <h2>Daniel Domscheit-Berg, worked for WikiLeaks until 2010<br></h2> <p>I met Julian online in 2007. We started working together, and it went from really good to really bad over three years. We didn't agree about where we wanted to go with WikiLeaks. It was developing from an organisation supporting whistleblowers to one that has an entire secrecy agenda. But it's Julian's project \u2013 it's his idea. And he is not really good with criticism. He takes a no compromise position.</p> <p>We haven't spoken since I quit. We had a tight relationship for more than three years \u2013 I would have called it a friendship. I'm not sure if I would any more, because I'm quite disillusioned. But he stayed with me a couple of times, the longest was for two months or so.</p> <p>Julian's more than just intelligent \u2013 he's streetwise, witty. He's good at thinking about and analysing systems. And he is really dedicated. Here was someone equally willing to do whatever was necessary. But if you're really good at something, it usually means you're terrible at something else.</p> <p>We basically had to decide if a mutiny was what we needed \u2013 in order to readjust the way that WikiLeaks was developing. Or if we should quit and try to find another way to approach it. And we decided on the latter. The name of WikiLeaks is tainted now. I'll never be involved with Wikileaks again. I can't even imagine he would excuse himself. He wouldn't be in this mess if he had the capacity for saying sorry.</p> <p>Julian has been dealing with this level of attention for more than a year now. And the attention is crucial, in respect to his potential affairs with the US. Whatever happens will set a&#xa0;precedent for the freedom of the press and the internet. I'm torn, because I fully agree that he should never be extradited to the US. But the court of law is there to establish what is right and wrong, and if you have violated a law, and we're ignoring it because we're sacrificing that for a higher goal, you're opening up a Pandora's box.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/iankatz\" title=\"\">Ian Katz</a>, deputy editor, the Guardian<br></h2> <p>Referring to a heterosexual male reporter who had fallen out with him particularly badly, Julian once claimed to me that the journalist had been \"in love with me\". It was, like so many things Assange says, preposterous, but it also contained a germ of truth. Assange is one of a tiny number of people I have met \u2013 Peter Mandelson is another \u2013 whose approval it is hard&#xa0;not to crave.</p> <p>The first time I met him, he was deathly pale and racked by a tubercular cough. We spent an hour or so talking about the best ways to communicate outside the earshot of the CIA. He&#xa0;told me about encrypted phones and taught me how to create a number code. It was like being inducted into a mildly glamorous, if slightly malodorous, secret club.</p> <p>Over the following weeks we communicated mostly by encrypted internet chat. In these late-night exchanges \u2013 Julian never rose before lunchtime \u2013 he lurched between stentorian admonishments for the latest perceived failure of his journalistic collaborators (\"We are very disappointed...\") and knowing matiness. I&#xa0;remember him once, rather over-familiarly, referring to me as \"Katzy\", and wondering if he was really telling me that he'd done his research and knew that is what my oldest friends called me.</p> <p>My last face-to-face encounter with Julian was a rather surreal four-hour conversation in the Norfolk pile that became his virtual prison while he awaited extradition hearings. By now, for reasons too complicated to recount, Julian had taken against the Guardian and declared that he regarded it as a greater threat to him than the Pentagon.</p> <p>Seated under the severe gaze of several generations of previous inhabitants of Ellingham Hall, Julian delivered a rambling disquisition that displayed many of the frequently contradictory aspects of his personality. There was a thoughtful discussion of the ephemeral nature of the internet and a fiendishly complicated plan he had to fix it, a hard-headed and acute assessment of how the publication of thousands of secret diplomatic cables had gone, a few flashes of menace (one former colleague suspected of leaking had now been \"sat on\") and some eye-wateringly unsavoury references to sex.</p> <p>We parted with a peace agreement of sorts, which Julian summarised in his curiously mannered, other-worldly vernacular: \"I'm a gentleman. I won't throw the first punch.\"<br><em><br>\u2022 Interviews by Alison Rourke, Merope Mills, Liese Spencer, Charlotte Northedge and Becky Barnicoat</em></p>",

  "<p>Jess Hunter, at 20, is by any test severely disabled. She is also remarkably pretty. I'm not sure that it is even politically correct to say that. One day last month she ventured to our news studio in her cumbersome wheelchair with her talent manager, assistant, and her coach. Jess is one of ParalympicsGB's prospects for a gold medal in the upcoming Games. Her sport is boccia.</p> <p>Her sport is what? Boccia rhymes with Gotcha and will be, I reckon, the secret sensation of the Paralympics. It's just one of the remarkable sports that will take the Games into another sphere from the breath-taking Olympics that have gone before. I suppose that its nearest able-bodied relative is the French sport of boule, or our own village green game of bowls.</p> <p>Hunter was born severely affected by cerebral palsy. She has little or no control over any of her limbs and cannot speak. Her wheelchair tilts her in a 45-degree position halfway between sitting up and lying down. Yet this extraordinary Paralympian trains 15 hours a week to sustain her position as one the world's greatest exponents of boccia. She is aided by an assistant who is not permitted to see the field of play \u2013 an area perhaps half a tennis court in size. Watching her in action, Jess is armed with six boccia balls of varying weights. Using her eyes to signal which ball she wants to throw, Jess then has to line up the ramp from which the ball will be projected. The assistant moves it up, down, left, and right according to Jess's eye signals. Once in position the jack is placed on a ledge on the ramp. There's a groove at the back of the ramp and Jess \u2013 with huge difficulty \u2013 locates it with a probe on her helmeted head. Having done so she prods it with the probe. She repeats the exercise as she plays each of her six balls. Stunningly, her first ball ends up nudging the jack. Playing as part of a pair (Jess's equally disabled team-mate is 17 years old but there are individual and team events as well), the field of play amazingly becomes a dense contest of tightly pitched balls. Suddenly one of the other contestants blasts the field open taking her own ball close to the newly positioned jack.</p> <p>As the play unfolds, I, and my colleagues watching, all forget that we are engaged by a contest between profoundly disabled young women, who cannot walk, or dress, or talk \u2013 playing a mesmerising and completely absorbing sport. For myself, with very little exposure to disability, my Paralympic journey as a commentator training for the games has been one of the most exciting and uplifting adventures of my reporting life.</p> <p>In the days leading up to the Paralympics, and throughout the coverage of the Games, my Channel 4 colleagues and I are going to share this adventure with you: meeting the Paralympians training amongst the rubble in Gaza; talking to the blind footballer whose brilliant left foot finds the ball by hearing the little bell that rings within it; and so much more.</p> <p>It has become a hands-on experience as well. I have played wheelchair basketball \u2013 one of the most savage sports I ever expect to play. I was crashed into, spun, tipped out, and constantly found the ball ripped from my grasp. Like wheelchair rugby it is an incredibly fast and skilled sport, making, like boccia, for&#xa0;an extraordinary and all-consuming spectator sport.</p> <p>As a cyclist, though, I have to confess that blind cycling is the sport that finally scared the Lycra pants off me. A few months back I made my way to the Manchester velodrome to experience the sport. The track was swarming with Olympic and Paralympic cyclists alike. It was here that I encountered some of the British military amputees from the Iraq and Afghan wars. Some had lost a leg and sported incredibly engineered prosthetics that were cleated into the pedal. Others had lost an arm and were aided by brilliantly conceived handle bar grips attached to their artificial arm.</p> <p>Blind cycling places you on the back of tandem with sighted rider at the front. I had never been on a tandem, never cycled completely blindfolded, and never ridden a fixed wheel bicycle on which there are neither gears nor brakes. Oh, and I had never cycled in a velodrome. Unsighted, the swoops up and down the sides of the track \u2013 the dives and spurts as you go faster and faster \u2013 were completely disorienting. I never knew where I was as I buried my head in the back of the rider in front. As we topped 43mph I feared my ageing legs just would not be able to keep up. I screamed to be allowed to stop. But the exhilaration, the space, the wind, the crowd noise, and yes, once again the sheer sport, obliterated my initial obsession with the disability.</p> <p>The Olympics may have thrilled us to the core; the Paralympics will take us somewhere else \u2013 one of the most exciting places I have ever been.</p> <h2><strong>Stoke Mandeville to Stratford: Key Paralympic moments</strong></h2> <p><strong>Stoke Mandeville, Great Britain, 1948 </strong>Neurologist Sir Ludwig Guttman creates an inter-hospital sporting event to help the rehabilitation of British war veterans at the Stoke Mandeville hospital.

  "<p>This is the second generation cee'd. They've made it longer, lower and narrower. More aerodynamic, with resulting improvements in fuel efficiency and C0<sub>2</sub> emissions. It's also stiffer, which \u2013 for anyone who isn't an expert in automotive engineering \u2013 is a good thing (no one wants to drive a flaccid car, do they?). Better all round, then.</p> <p>There is one thing they've blatantly failed to address, though. I'm talking about the apostrophe, of course. The lower-case c, well, that's just childish and irritating. The apostrophe is a catastrophe, a punctuation abomination. Apostrophes are used to signify possession, or to mark missing letters. The d following this one would suggest the latter \u2013 'd means either had or would. So, given a&#xa0;good subediting, this is either a&#xa0;Kia Cee Had or a Kia Cee Would, right?

Or would've done, if the cee'd'd really been ours. Plus, they probably didn't even have cruise control.</p> <p>Where in Norfolk? Not far from King's Lynn, as it happens. With an&#xa0;apostrophe.

  "<p>When my husband, Simon, started feeling achy, tired and fuzzy-headed, I dismissed it as man-flu. But when he was still shivering in bed days later, it made sense to see the GP. After a blood test, he was told to pack a bag and go straight to hospital. There, doctors discovered his kidneys were failing \u2013 they weren't filtering the toxins from his blood and he was being poisoned from the inside. Without treatment, this would kill him. Simon was facing dialysis and put on the waiting list for a kidney transplant.</p> <p>At the renal clinic they call people like Simon \"crash-landers\"; without warning, Simon's kidneys had simply decided to pack up. Other people with kidney disease have years to come to terms with the slow deterioration and weigh up their options \u2013 we had days.</p> <p>I was incredibly frightened. Simon was fading before my eyes \u2013 he became very frail and vague, confined to a hospital bed. He was so vulnerable my protective instincts kicked in. I was losing my husband; something had to be done.</p> <p>As soon as donation entered my mind, I no longer thought of it as my kidney, it was Simon's \u2013 I&#xa0;was looking after it until it would become his. After I offered, Simon was hesitant; he felt I shouldn't have&#xa0;to lose a vital organ, but he soon saw how determined I was. I was clear from the start \u2013 he shouldn't feel any guilt, this was a&#xa0;gift, freely given. What's more, it was a solution. I would get to bring my husband back to health.</p> <p>The donation procedure is not straightforward. The battery of tests include psychological as well as physical ones. One of the questions was: \"If there was a one in a hundred chance of you dying on the operating table, would you still go ahead?\" I&#xa0;said yes. Simon was asked: \"If there was a one in a thousand chance of Katherine dying, would you still go ahead?\" He said no. These were the right answers; it persuaded the medics we were emotionally balanced enough for the operation.</p> <p>Finally, almost a year after his admission, we found ourselves at opposite ends of the same hospital ward, waiting to go into theatre. My kidney would be removed first, then it would be transplanted in him.</p> <p>I&#xa0;won't pretend I wasn't terrified. I'd never stayed in hospital before, let alone had a major operation. We&#xa0;texted each other, but what do you say? Good luck seemed to trivialise the most important moment of both our lives.</p> <p>Removing my kidney was more complicated than expected \u2013 one of my arteries was tricky to work around and Simon had to wait for 12&#xa0;hours until his surgery.</p> <p>We were both in the recovery room at the same time afterwards, and were told the best news \u2013 it had been a success. Instantly, I felt a huge weight lift from my shoulders. I'd had unfeasible faith in my kidney and it was so gratifying that it was doing its job; it turned out to be man-sized at 11cm, perfect for Simon.</p> <p>But before we could celebrate, we had to go on what doctors describe as the \"rocky road\" to recovery. There was still a chance Simon could reject my kidney and I was faced with three months of pain while my body adapted to the loss. Ironically, as Simon improved almost by the hour, I was struggling with the symptoms he'd had \u2013 the weakness and exhaustion of poor kidney function.</p> <p>We'd go out for little staggers together around the hospital grounds \u2013 I didn't resent the discomfort, as it was wonderful to see Simon getting better. Instead I&#xa0;felt like a hero. And it sounds corny, but it was also the ultimate way of showing my commitment to him.</p> <p>Three years on, we're both in our 40s, Simon's kidney is still functioning well and we are back to normal life. As time passes, I am learning to relax a little. I realised the other day I hadn't asked about the results of his latest check-up.</p> <p>We enjoy a private competition of dropping our story into conversation with strangers to see who can make jaws drop the lowest \u2013 I'm so glad it's become something to laugh about.</p> <p>Sometimes he jokes about the \"good wee\" he's just had, and it's a&#xa0;lovely implicit thank you. After the surgery, Simon bought me a ring and we call it my kidney ring, but I&#xa0;don't expect endless gratitude \u2013 just seeing him healthy and happy is reward enough.</p> <p>\u2022 As told to Emily Cunningham</p> <p>\u2022 Do you have an experience to share?

  "<p>Treacle evokes a love/hate response more than any other baking ingredient I can think of. For me, it's essential, adding a certain dark note that accents most fruit flavours and spices. True, it has a hint of iron, like sucking the blood from a cut finger, and perhaps this sets off a primitive revulsion in some. The colour, too,&#xa0;is disturbing, giving foods a&#xa0;greenish-brown cast that would be wholly acceptable in a <a href=\"http://www.farrow-ball.com/colours/paint/fcp-category/list\" title=\"\">Farrow &amp; Ball paint swatch</a> but somewhat less jolly in your favourite scone recipe. But if you can warm to treacle's inherent weirdness, as I have, it becomes a true baker's friend, perfect for helping plain old caster sugar taste a little more ballsy, or adding a deep, rich note to a simple apple muffin or buttery shortcrust tart.</p> <p>To help the flavour, add a little spice to smooth it: allspice and caraway, cinnamon and clove all soften treacle's tarry qualities. Grated zest from an orange or lemon brightens it, and milk, butter or rich cream softens its character entirely.</p> <h2>Spiced treacle apple tart</h2> <p>A ridiculously fragile rough apple tart that tastes delicious and is a doddle to make. It's not a keeper, rather a tart to make and eat messily within minutes of baking. If you dredge more sugar on after baking, and scorch it with a blow torch or under a hot grill, the br\u00fbl\u00e9e finish that gives is mighty fine. Very good warm with a little clotted cream.</p> <p><strong>275g plain flour, plus extra for&#xa0;shaping</strong><br><strong>50g spelt or rye flour</strong><br><strong>1 tsp ground allspice</strong><br><strong>200g unsalted butter, softened</strong><br><strong>50g black treacle (or molasses)</strong><br><strong>50g brown sugar, plus extra to finish</strong><br><strong>1 egg yolk</strong><br><strong>2-3 large dessert apples</strong></p> <p>Put the two flours and the allspice in a bowl and rub in the butter until any lumps disappear. Beat the treacle, sugar and yolk until smooth, add this to the buttery flour and mix to a smooth, soft paste. Spoon the paste on to a sheet of nonstick paper or clingfilm, wrap and chill until firm.</p> <p>Allow the dough to warm slightly at room temperature, then try to roll out thin \u2013 don't fret if it cracks and looks a bit disastrous: it will bake smoothly. Using about half the dough (use the rest to make another tart, or freeze it), on a baking tray lined with nonstick paper cobble together a pastry disc about 30cm in diameter. Peel, core and slice the apples, and fan them out one or two layers-thick on top, leaving a 2cm rim around the edge. Roughly crimp the rim back in on to the apples, dredge with sugar and bake at 180C (160C fan-assisted)/350F/gas mark 4 for 40 minutes, until the apples have coloured slightly and the pastry is crisp.</p> <h2>Treacle and caraway apple muffins</h2> <p>Caraway seeds used to be a staple in British kitchens. Here they help to link the spelt flour and apples in much the same way that cinnamon might, by adding a subtle background flavour. Makes about 12.</p> <p><strong>100g unsalted butter, melted</strong><br><strong>50ml sunflower oil</strong><br><strong>50g treacle</strong><br><strong>175g soft brown sugar, any sort</strong><br><strong>3 medium eggs</strong><br><strong>3 tsp vanilla extract</strong><br><strong>3 tsp caraway seeds</strong><br><strong>150g plain flour</strong><br><strong>150g spelt flour</strong><br><strong>2 tsp baking powder</strong><br><strong>3 small apples, peeled, cored and diced</strong><br><strong>Flaked almonds, to finish</strong></p> <p>Prepare a 12-pocket muffin tray with paper cases and heat the oven to 190C (170C fan-assisted)/375F/gas mark 5. Beat the butter, oil, treacle and sugar until smooth, then beat in the eggs one at a time, until evenly mixed though. Add the vanilla and caraway, mix well, then add the flours and baking powder, and stir just to combine. Fold in the apples, divide the mixture between the cases, filling them almost to the top, and scatter almonds on top. Bake for 25 minutes, or until a&#xa0;skewer comes out clean. Remove from the oven, and carefully lift the muffins from the tray and on to a rack, so they don't sweat as they cool.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.danlepard.com/guardian\" title=\"\">danlepard.com/guardian</a><br>\u2022 This article was edited on 27 August 2012.

  "<p>Why put real people in a novel? Pat Barker's <em>Regeneration</em> features among its leading characters two famous historical figures: the war poets Siegfried Sassoon and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/wilfred-owen\" title=\"\">Wilfred Owen</a>. In the novel they meet, as they did in life, at Craiglockhart Hospital near Edinburgh. The novel's pivotal character is also a real person, the anthropologist turned psychiatrist William Rivers, who is treating both men. The writer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/robert-graves\" title=\"\">Robert Graves</a>, a friend of Sassoon, and other doctors who dealt with shell shock during the first world war also appear. The most painful episode in the whole novel is not set in the trenches but in the \"electrical room\" of a London hospital, where Rivers watches Dr Lewis Yealland administering frequent and agonising electrical shocks to a patient who has been made mute by his experiences at the front. The terrified soldier must utter words to get the torture to stop. An author's note at the end of the novel assures us that Dr Yealland existed and that he detailed his ghastly methods in his own book.</p> <p>The patients in the novel are, we might say, half-invented. Their names are certainly fictitious, but Barker appears to have based their histories on cases recorded by Rivers in a posthumously published book. Not only is Rivers the central character, he has provided the information on which Barker has based several of her other characters. The reader's awareness of this gives these characters, glimpsed in passing as Rivers makes his rounds of Craiglockhart, a haunting life. Each of them is \u2013 was \u2013 as much a real person as the two great war poets, though they have long been lost among Rivers's case studies. Forgotten victims, they return from the past.</p> <p>For a novelist, the use of such personages is restrictive as much as it is fruitful. Barker, who lists her main historical sources at the end of her book, has been narratively scrupulous in her reinvention of these people. They can do nothing that is not historically verifiable. Owen's meeting with Sassoon at Craiglockhart is interesting enough, but the novelist cannot extend their friendship beyond what we know. The most powerful evidence of their rapport is the manuscript of Owen's poem \"Anthem for Doomed Youth\", which is covered with amendments in Sassoon's handwriting. Barker makes out of this an intense dialogue between the two men in which Sassoon \u2013 the more confident of the two \u2013 pushes Owen to find the \"better\" words. Our understanding of the first world war has been shaped by these two men and their poetry. By bringing them to life in her novel, it feels as if Barker is taking on a necessary challenge.</p> <p>It is not only in dialogue that the novelist makes fiction out of carefully researched fact. In her narrative, she takes her readers into the minds of these characters. The fictionalisation of William Rivers and the inhabiting of his thoughts is the key to the novel. Humane and psychologically perceptive, he is the novelist's representative. This is not just because of his insight, but also because of his distance from the horrifying experiences of his own patients.</p> <p>He recovers the experience of warfare from the soldiers he treats, but knows nothing of it at first hand. He is teaching his men to remember, but he approaches their memories as a foreigner, guiltily wishing that he had been able to fight. Disconcertingly, though he treats his patients with something close to tenderness, he is not some anti-war hero with whom the contemporary reader can easily identify. He believes that \"the war must be fought to a finish, for the sake of the succeeding generations\".</p> <p>The psychiatrist has been a favoured character for novels before this one, leading the reader into the hidden stories of those whom he or she treats. Barker slips some of Rivers's theories about psychological trauma into her narrative, without either endorsement or satire. Some of the arguments that pass through his head sound convincing, while others seem suspect. Believing that \"prolonged strain, immobility and helplessness\" were more likely to cause men to \"break down\" than \"the sudden shocks or bizarre horrors\" that his patients themselves used to explain their condition, for instance, he muses that this must also explain the prevalence of \"hysterical disorders\" in women in peacetime.</p> <p>Not all the characters are real people. Billy Prior is the most important invented character in <em>Regeneration </em>(and in the two subsequent volumes of the trilogy) and is given attributes that galvanise the fiction. He is socially and sexually ambiguous. Though he is an officer (for only officers get to be treated at Craiglockhart) he comes from a working-class background. He is an interloper, angrily observing the snobbery and smugness of the officer class. Having recreated a world rather than inventing it, the novelist needs licence to see it from an angle that no amount of historical research could provide. Billy Prior gives her that angle.</p> <p>\u2022 John Mullan is professor of English at University College London.</p>",
  "<p>Wilderness is at the heart of Michelle Paver's writing \u2013 from the prehistoric forest of her bestselling children's series <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9781444004724/chronicles-of-ancient-darkness-omnibus\" title=\"\">Chronicles of Ancient Darkness</a>, to the pitch-black arctic night of her ghost story <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/horror/9781409123781/dark-matter\" title=\"\"><em>Dark Matter</em></a>. Her descriptions of unpopulated expanses are so compelling, so evocative, that she must live on a windswept shoreline somewhere, or deep in virgin woodland \u2013 mustn't she?</p> <p>No. Paver lives in Wimbledon \u2013 although approaching her home across the scrubby grass and unpruned trees of the common, I thought: if you are going to live in London, somewhere in the middle of Wimbledon common is about the wildest you're going to get. Couple this with the fact that her home, into which she moved a year ago, was owned by the Victorian ghost story writer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Oliphant\" title=\"\">Margaret Oliphant</a> \u2013 one of Paver's favourite authors \u2014 and it starts to look rather suitable.</p> <p>\"I used to live down the road in Wimbledon. It was very suburban, and for about three years I had been quite miserable, thinking 'I'm writing about a forest and I'm not flipping in it',\" says Paver, a slight figure curled on the end of her couch. \"I would love to live in the wilds of nowhere and when writing Chronicles I would occasionally rent a cottage in the middle of nowhere that had no mobile reception, but I'm not about to move away from my family\" (Paver lives alone, but her mother, aunt and sister are nearby). The common, then, was her compromise. \"I'm pretending, but in two minutes I can be out in the woods feeding the crows. There's no garden but there's 1,600 acres out there I don't have to look after, so it's the best I can do. It's not quite the arctic. But it works for me.\"</p> <p>Paver is someone for whom the lure of the wild is irresistible. In researching the Chronicles series, which tells the story of the stone-age boy Torak, his wolf and his friend Renn, she swam with killer whales, ate raw seal liver, watched a seal being skinned and tasted whale blubber. Her new novel, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9780141339269/gods-and-warriors\" title=\"\"><em>Gods and Warriors</em></a>, launches her second children's series. This one is set in the bronze age Mediterranean, around 1500BC, and is filled with the colours, sounds and scents of the Minoans and Mycenaeans. It follows the adventures of Hylas, an \"Outsider\", rejected from his village, living alone with his sister on a hillside tending goats when terrifying black-clad warriors attack and the pair are separated. This first book is his quest to find his sister; in it, Hylas meets Pirra, the 12-year-old daughter of a high priestess, who disfigures her face to avoid an arranged marriage.</p> <p>Paver has been climbing active volcanoes, meeting dolphins and knapping obsidian to get everything right (she's just back from a research trip to Milos, where her lack of skill at knapping \u2013 shaping stone tools \u2013 meant that she \"left a libation of blood\" behind). \"You have to be there, to realise what things mean for characters,\" she says. \"I've climbed Stromboli when it's erupting, which is quite a heavy climb, three hours with a helmet to get to the top. When you're there and it's dark and you can see this eruption and feel it, it's quite different to watching it on TV. I've got Hylas in my head because I know roughly what's going to happen, and I'm there, I can feel the grit, I'm coughing it up for days afterwards. So it's fun, but it also allows me to feel the story.\"</p> <p>She has sold more than 2.5m copies worldwide of the six books in the Chronicles of Ancient Darkness series (they include <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9781842551318/wolf-brother\" title=\"\"><em>Wolf Brother</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9781842551134/spirit-walker\" title=\"\"><em>Spirit Walker</em></a> and the final volume, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2011/jul/13/ghost-hunter-michelle-paver-review\" title=\"\"><em>Ghost Hunter</em></a>, which won her the Guardian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/guardian-children-s-fiction-prize-2010\" title=\"\">children's fiction prize in 2010</a>). She had the idea for <em>Gods and Warriors</em> while writing book five; at first it amounted simply to the vision of \"a boy with very few clothes on sitting in a rowing boat with no food, very hot sea, sun, adrift \u2013 and I thought I'd really like to know what's happened to him\".</p> <p>She jotted down ideas in a notebook she keeps by her bed, but realised she wasn't going to be able to move straight from the stone age of Torak to the bronze age of Hylas. So she decided to fit in the critically acclaimed <em>Dark Matter</em>, as a sort of literary palate cleanser.</p> <p>\"I thought I'll have a break, do something completely different, a ghost story set in the 1930s, and that gave me time \u2013 it sounds so precious \u2013 to make the mental adjustment.\" <em>Dark Matter</em> is the story of a man left alone in the high arctic one winter, and the haunting which creeps up on him. Paver went to Spitsbergen during the polar night to research it. She doesn't use the internet, so extensive research, at home and abroad, is the way she works. Her office is stuffed with files crammed with details of her trips, as well as travel books and biographies.</p> <p>For <em>Gods and Warriors</em> she worked with a professor of Aegean archaeology, and has studied contemporary pastoral societies around the world to get ideas for how her bronze age characters lived. \"I sometimes wonder why I do so much research \u2013 I look at other successful writers and I think it must just be so relaxing to write about flying horses or something, but I have to make it plausible.\"</p> <p>Given that she writes about a stone goddess who speaks, and about the \"Angry Ones\" \u2013 versions of the Furies who hunt those who have murdered their kin \u2013 plausibility starts to look a little shaky. Paver smiles. \"I know, but a lot of what Hylas and Pirra experience in the first book, the goddess and hearing her speak, you can explain through sensory deprivation and the noxious fumes in the cave \u2013 hallucination. And again, with the Angry Ones, it's about being very scared \u2013 the children are terrified, they haven't eaten or drunk anything for a while. And they genuinely believe \u2013 I've talked to a girl in Greenland who believes she's seen a ghost coming out of the sea because that's what the culture tells her she will see in the winter.\"</p> <p>One of the key elements of Chronicles is the voice of Wolf, the orphaned cub who journeys through the ancient northern forests with Torak as he battles demons and becomes a spirit walker. Paver wasn't sure she wanted to continue writing in an animal's voice for her second series, but, after swimming with dolphins in Florida and researching them extensively, she found the lure too strong. So Spirit, a dolphin, rescues Hylas both from a shark attack and when he is trapped in an earthquake.</p> <p>Another element of Chronicles that carries over to <em>Gods and Warriors</em> is the scrappy boy hero, and the clever, snippy girl by his side. Pirra gets equal billing with Hylas \u2013 something that Paver didn't find in the novels she read as a child. She loved the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2011/jul/28/willard-price-adventure-relaunched\" title=\"\">Willard Price adventure books</a>, about Hal and Roger Hunt's quest to bring animals back alive for their father's zoo, \"but there were no girls in that. The message for me when I was a kid in the late 60s was that the boys had all the fun, all the adventure,\" she says. \"A lot of my writing is wish-fulfilment, making things the way I want them to be. With Torak, I wanted a wolf, and to be really dashing. These are books I would have loved as a child. I wasn't criticising Willard Price as a 10-year-old but I just wanted to know a bit more about Hal and Roger, and it would have been nice if there was a girl in it, so I could have identified with her.\"</p> <p>The young Paver was always writing her own stories but never thought she was going to be an author; intrigued by the advances in genetics, she studied biochemistry at Oxford. She was \"total rubbish\" in the laboratory, and \"too impatient and critical\" to be a teacher, so she decided \"on a whim\" to become a lawyer, and found herself at the forefront of patent law in a big city firm.</p> <p>\"It was a bit of a hasty decision,\" she says ruefully. She soon found law had taken over much of her life. \"At the time women were outnumbered five to one in the city in law so there was a sense of trailblazing,\" she says.</p> <p>She wrote around the edges of her law career, and sent stories off to agents and competitions, and eventually things began to happen that \"pointed the finger at chucking in the law. My health wasn't very good, I was sort of burning out. Having crying jags&#xa0;late at night isn't very healthy. And then my father got terminal cancer \u2013 I was very close to him. When something like that happens \u2013 it's merely a truism until it happens to you \u2013 you start re-evaluating your&#xa0;life.\"</p> <p>She took a year's sabbatical, travelled the world \u2013 bumped, almost literally, into the bear that inspired the opening of Chronicles, in which Torak's father is killed and Torak flees a murderous demon in the shape of a bear. Still writing, still sending pieces in to competitions, she returned to law after her break and realised immediately that she couldn't do it. She quit without a publishing contract, but while she was working out her notice Transworld, which had liked one of her competition entries, signed her up for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780552147521/without-charity\" title=\"\"><em>Without Charity</em></a>, an adult love story set in the 19th century. She wrote five adult novels: \"I was enjoying it. What I wasn't enjoying was every time the book would come out they'd say it didn't do as well as expected.\" Her agent, Peter Cox, \"said 'if you get an idea for something else, why not try it?'\"</p> <p>The efficiency that helped make Paver a successful lawyer means she keeps everything, and while trawling through old notes she stumbled on something she wrote at university, about a boy and a wolf and a bear set in Viking-age Norway. \"I thought there's something there, so I did a little synopsis, and I thought the setting isn't quite right, let's take it right back,\" she says. \"Peter was on the phone the next day and said: drop everything.\"</p> <p>His instincts were right. <em>Wolf Brother</em> sent the publishing world into a frenzy, selling for \u00a32m. That year Paver had to finish an adult novel, as well as beginning the children's series she had traced out. But she was used to working hard and was able to do it; she still writes for six hours every day \u2013 each novel, she estimates, takes 1,000 hours.</p> <p>\"You have time sheets, you record the hour,\" she says. \"I had a pretty intense first year when I wrote two books \u2013 I never want to do that again. Then my life changed completely.\"</p>",
  "<p>Chris Adrian is an American paediatrician, an oncologist and a theologian, and <em>The Children's Hospital </em>could only have been written by someone who is a paediatrician, an oncologist and a theologian, as well as a skilled literary practitioner. It is a profoundly disturbing novel, suffused with a weird and unsettling poetry, that asks deep questions about healing and harming.</p> <p>Originally published in 2006, it has only just been released here, partly, one assumes, due to the success of the author's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9781847081865/the-great-night\" title=\"\">2011 novel <em>The Great Night</em></a><em> </em>and his short story collection <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fantasy/9781847081858/a-better-angel\" title=\"\"><em>A Better Angel</em></a>. It is a less streamlined affair than the former, and boasts an almost manic profusion of ideas and images. In the hands of a less skilful writer, this capaciousness might be deemed a flaw; it is as if the author were uncertain that he might ever get published again and consequently was determined not to cut a single good notion. It is only because Adrian's work is so good that the reader does not feel overwhelmed.</p> <p>Like many of his peers, Adrian combines elements from genre writing (<em>The Children's Hospital </em>is by turns science-fictional, fantasy and thriller) with insights from the higher reaches of literary-theoretical speculation. This ambitious intermixture is almost the defining feature of the new generation of American literary writers, who, taking their cue from Thomas Pynchon, systematically forgo the pastel social realism of the majority of the previous generation. But however far down that route Adrian travels, the work is both emotionally and morally tethered to reality as we know it. And what could be more affecting and ethically problematic than one's duties to a sick child?</p> <p>The central figure of <em>The Children's Hospital</em> is a medical student, Jemma Claflin, who has already lost her parents, brother and significant other in variously traumatising ways. Because of these losses, her relationship with another intern, Rob Dickens, is being held slightly in check lest an admission of love bring down yet more tragedy.</p> <p>Jemma's romantic anxieties turn out to be both germane and trivial. How will their relationship cope when, unexpectedly, the world ends? Torrential rain turns into a catastrophic flood, with only the hospital surviving the deluge. It now floats over a drowned world, having been designed to do so by its mysterious and troubled architect; moreover, the hospital's central computer has just declared that it is the Preserving Angel. It has created SF replicators to produce anything you might desire (these are never really described except as misty pockets).</p> <p>Parts of the book are narrated by another angel, the Recording Angel, who has watched over Jemma all her life, and he reveals that another two angels will be coming to the hospital: the Accusing Angel, \"to remind them why they suffer\", and the Destroying Angel \"to revoke the promise of survival and redemption, and to teach them the awful truth about furious sheltering grace\". This structure provides narrative anchors to guide the reader through the horrors to come.</p> <p>Other sections are narrated by Jemma's dead brother, who we learn died in a shocking, possibly Satanically inspired suicide (the exact details of which will never leave you). Jemma's brother is an obvious candidate to take on one of the angelic roles, but there are others: a boy who hid in the hospital even though he wasn't ill; an amnesiac man they call Ishmael who is an improbable survivor of the deluge, and others it would be a shame to give away here.</p> <p>The hospital attempts to be both a new society in this new world and to function in its old ways; there are, after all, a great many extremely ill children on board. In fact, at one point, Jemma realises that they seem to have pairs of children with the same disease. It is an ark of symptoms and victims, and some of Adrian's descriptions \u2013 a girl with catheter bags hanging round her like a ball-gown, the child with too many fingers and not enough brain cells \u2013 are painful to read.</p> <p>Then there is a miracle, the \"Harrowing of the Hospital\", whereby Jemma manages to unleash some power to heal them all. It is a testament to Adrian's talent that you realise that the best possible thing happening is probably not going to be a good thing at all. The best and the weakest of humanity, the most-feared and most-hoped for things, can all be found within these pages.</p> <p>A reader with even a smattering of biblical knowledge will realise two things fairly quickly. In the Book of Genesis, God's covenant with Noah was that \"never again will a flood destroy the earth\". In the Book of Revelation, the vision of the new heaven and the new earth has the haunting phrase \"and there was no more sea\". Adrian's apocalypse is, terrifyingly, quite clearly not the Apocalypse. It implies a future, and how to deal with the future under the shadow of irreversibly, infinitely suffering children and adults, is the major theme.</p> <p><em>The Children's Hospital</em> is astoundingly good: much though I loved the smart, clever and equally moving <em>The Great Night</em> \u2013 which fused <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soylent_Green\" title=\"\"><em>Soylent Green</em></a> and a terminally ill child \u2013 <em>The Children's Hospital</em> is possibly the more raggedly ambitious book, and proof that Adrian's ability is equal to his ambition.</p> <p>\u2022 Stuart Kelly's <em>The Book of Lost Books</em> is published by Polygon.</p>",
  "<p>Lilly MacGlashan is two years, seven months old. Her parents count the months as others might not, because each is precious additional time, bought at high cost. She was diagnosed soon after birth with neuroblastoma, the cancer that causes more children's deaths than anything other than tragic accidents.</p> <p>Her father, John, has nothing but praise for the early treatment she had from the NHS. She had chemotherapy to shrink the large tumour in her abdomen on her adrenal gland, followed by surgery to remove it. Addenbrooke's hospital in Cambridge gave her the all-clear in June 2010. Then, unusually in such a young child, she had a sudden and violent relapse the following month.</p> <p>\"She was covered with tumours \u2013 all over her brain and spine,\" he said. \"We had a fabulous oncologist at the time. She attacked it aggressively with high-dose chemotherapy and stem cells taken and put back into her body. She had that and reacted fabulously.</p> <p>\"Then they took us into a room and said that's all we can do. It will come back within two months to two years. Take her home and take some pictures and enjoy her while you can.\"</p> <p>The MacGlashans are not the only parents to have had that devastating advice. Neuroblastoma, a relatively rare cancer that develops from nerve tissue in about 100 small children a year, is usually not found until it has spread. In those children with advanced cancers, deemed the high-risk group, only 30% survive for five years after diagnosis.</p> <p>The treatment these children have on the NHS is good, but for those who relapse the only option is a clinical trial for which not all are eligible. Neuroblastoma sits on the faultline of what the NHS is able to do and is willing to pay for \u2013 but the debate is much more difficult, because unlike other terminal cancers, the lives it shortens and takes are those of young children.</p> <p>The MacGlashans, from Dunstable, Bedfordshire, reacted as most parents do. They were not prepared to accept the verdict that nothing more could be done and started raising money to pay for treatment abroad. With the help of their NHS oncologist, the couple found the only place in the world offering treatment for children whose neuroblastoma has relapsed and spread across the blood/brain barrier. They took Lilly to the celebrated <a href=\"http://www.mskcc.org/\" title=\"\">Memorial Sloan-Kettering</a> cancer centre in New York.</p> <p>Lilly has had pioneering immunotherapy there \u2013 given antibodies that attach to the neuroblastoma cells and activate the child's immune system to attack and kill the tumour. The results have so far been remarkable. There is no sign of the cancer, although dark patches on brain scans caused by past haemorrhages may hide cells. It had invaded her eye, but her sight is back to normal. The only sign of Lilly's illness is that radiotherapy has left her smaller than her healthy twin sister, Molly.</p> <p>The strain on the family has been enormous. Lilly has just gone back to New York for another set of the regular scans she must have, which cost $59,000 (\u00a337,000), before flights and other costs. So far, her treatment has cost \u00a3610,000, raised from family, friends and public appeals.</p> <p>\"It's just part of my life now,\" said John MacGlashan, an electrician who took a year's unpaid leave while his wife, Dawn, stopped work as a hairdresser to raise money and take Lilly to New York. \"All I think about is getting the money to get her over to America to get the next set of scans, which they won't do in the UK. New York is one of the most expensive places I have ever lived in \u2013 it costs up to $5 for a loaf of bread. We spent nine months there last year and three months so far this year.\"</p> <p>So far they have raised \u00a3250,000 and he is touched by the events people have organised to help. \"Such generosity,\" he said. \"People knock the British public but they are amazing.\" But worrying every day about money, he says, is \"a massive strain, it's awful\".</p> <p>Lilly has done fantastically well so far, he says. He was heartened by meeting children who had survived for nine and even 11 years, on a fundraising walk in Central Park. \"Some kids are surviving who can't get it out of their body but the drugs are keeping them going and they go to school and have full lives. The worst thing in this country is that they will not accept that. I'm not knocking the NHS. They have the best chemotherapy for neuroblastoma and they get the kids to a terrific position. But I'm disgusted with the way they won't help [after relapse]. They could give money to the primary care trusts and funding for children to go abroad.\"</p> <p>At Sloan-Kettering, he says, there are children from Greece, Italy, France, Spain and Norway who are fully funded by their governments.</p> <p>Immunotherapy is promising. Britain is participating in the European <a href=\"https://www.siopen-r-net.org/\" title=\"\">Siopen trial</a>, which some relapsed children are eligible to join. It compares a combination of a monoclonal antibody called Ch14.18 and a cytokine (molecules that stimulate the immune system) against antibody alone.</p> <p>But the <a href=\"http://www.childrenscancer.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Neuroblastoma Alliance</a>, which supports families such as the MacGlashans to raise money for treatment abroad, points out that a trial in the US, <a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0911123\" title=\"\">published by the eminent New England Journal of Medicine</a>, has already shown that using the antibody together with two other cytokines cuts deaths by 25%. US children now receive all three drugs. \"Parents say if there is published research that says three drugs work, I want my child to have three \u2013 not just one,\" said its chief executive, Alison Moy.</p> <p>The parents of one child who was enrolled in the trial and was then randomly assigned just one drug took the extreme step of going to court. Last year, the high court judge Mr Justice Ryder ruled that it would be in the best interests of the girl to have both drugs. When their NHS trust still refused to guarantee to provide both drugs, the family went to the US.</p> <p>The MacGlashans' MP, Andrew Selous, last month in the Commons questioned the ethics of the European trial for not ensuring all the children taking part get at least the best existing treatment. \"At the moment, there are too few options available for high-risk neuroblastoma children who fail to achieve a lasting remission after frontline treatment,\" he said in a Commons question to the health minister, Paul Burstow.</p> <p>\"In the UK, parents see a system that gives up on their children too soon while there should still be hope. Much higher numbers of children are surviving for much longer with the American treatment, and some are achieving permanent remission following treatment at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering cancer centre in New York. We need to make sure that level of expertise is available here in the United Kingdom.\"</p> <p>But the government's cancer director, Prof Sir Mike Richards, says he is still not confident the US treatment, with two extra cytokines, is of benefit and not harmful. The European clinical trial was intended to help answer that question. That, he said, is \"why, frankly, we can't recommend patients to go abroad\". The drug combination had not been licensed in the US, he said. \"No authority would want to be denying children a treatment unless they had good reason.\"</p> <p>Other families are led into desperate measures, heading with their children for clinics abroad offering treatments for which there is far less evidence.</p> <p>In June, seven-year-old Olivia Downie from Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, travelled to a clinic in Tijuana, Mexico. She was gravely ill and her mother, Lauren, says she hoped only to relieve her pain which even morphine could not control. But the treatment \u2013 sono-photodynamic therapy \u2013 did nothing to help her. She got much worse and an ambulance was called. Olivia was put on a life-support machine and transferred to a private Mexican hospital. Her parents were forced to appeal for money to fly her home in an air ambulance. Their pleas for her to be brought home to die touched many people and more than \u00a3150,000 was donated. Olivia died within 48 hours of her return.</p> <p>Lauren said the NHS did all it could for Olivia but the options ran out. She feels too little money is going to research into a devastating disease. \"People are having to make random stabs in the dark to try to prolong their children's life or quality of life,\" she said. She now deeply regrets travelling to Mexico.</p> <p>David Longman understands why parents go to extreme lengths. He did it in 2004, when his daughter Louise, 19, had a vascular tumour. The NHS said the only answer was amputation of her arm or radiation which would render it useless. Longman took Louise to a Russian clinic for what was advertised as photodynamic therapy \u2013 the use of a drug which, when activated by light, would kill cancer cells.</p> <p>\"She went to Russia for treatment. It had no effect whatsoever. If anything, the tumour grew,\" said Longman. \"I couldn't afford the \u00a330,000 so did a deal with ITN. We went on TV and said it was a miracle. The trouble is that if someone wears a white coat and says they are going to do their best for us, we believe them, even if they fail.</p> <p>\"The sadness is that there are properly regulated, organised clinics outside the UK, but if you find them advertising on the web offering to do miraculous things that nobody else in the UK believes are possible, you have to question it.</p> <p>\"We're not talking about Sloan-Kettering in the US. I have yet to hear of anybody who has come back from Mexico who is fixed and yet to find anybody who has been to China and who has said I have got rid of my tumour \u2013 it has gone. There may be the odd one who comes back fixed but there is no guarantee that it was the treatment that fixed them.\"</p> <p>PDT \u2013 photodynamic therapy \u2013 in fact was the answer for Louise, but not in Russia. Longman tracked down the leading experts in Britain and persuaded one of them to treat Louise. PDT is approved by the <a href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice)</a> for use in some cancers, such as skin and lung cancer, where it is possible to get light from a laser to within 1cm of the tumour.</p> <p>While the Russian doctor had merely shone light on the skin, doctors pioneering the treatment in Britain were able to put optical fibres into the arm to activate the light-sensitive drug. Louise was cured and Longman started a charity called <a href=\"http://www.killingcancer.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Killing Cancer</a> to campaign for more recognition and funding for PDT in recognised centres in Britain.</p> <p>Neuroblastoma is not susceptible to PDT, because the cancer cells hide and invade parts of the body that light cannot reach. Clinics in Mexico and China are offering what they claim is an advance \u2013 sono-photodynamic therapy, or SPDT. They sell it as a natural, non-invasive therapy, using non-toxic light-sensitive substances such as chlorophyll which \"explode\" with oxygen, killing the cancer cells when activated not only by light but also by ultrasound waves which, they say, can reach every part of the body.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.yorkshirelasercentre.org/\" title=\"\">Prof Keyvan Moghissi</a>, one of the UK's foremost experts on PDT, says there is no good evidence for SPDT. \"In my opinion, SPDT is not a clinical reality,\" said Moghissi, a heart and lung surgeon who was involved in the earliest clinical trials of PDT and edits the leading journal in the field.</p> <p>Moghissi, who founded the Yorkshire Laser Centre which provides PDT for the NHS, says some basic research has been done on SPDT, but \"for doing it in humans, I believe there is no place for it. I believe there is a lot of laboratory work to be done.\"</p> <p>Mohgissi says nobody should be prevented from getting the treatment they want \u2013 \"thank God we live in a country where there is a choice,\" he says. But good information is key.</p> <p>\"Before spending money, before going abroad, people should have consultations with people in this country. Their GP should send them to people who are knowledgeable.\" Sometimes hospital consultants are also not as helpful to families as they could be in telling them there is no more that they can do for a child, he added. \"They should say, let me help you, understanding that when you have a child suffering you are very vulnerable.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dundee.ac.uk/dermatology/photo/staff/HM.html\" title=\"\">Prof Harry Moseley of Dundee University</a>, who runs a unit offering PDT at Ninewells Hospital &amp; Medical School, co-wrote a <a href=\"http://ict.sagepub.com/content/9/4/317.full.pdf+html\" title=\"\">etter to the journal Integrative Cancer Therapies</a>, which published accounts of three patients with advanced breast cancer who were given SPDT. He questioned the conduct and ethics of the trial, which is cited by clinics offering SPDT as evidence that it works. \"We could not find sufficient grounds to support the use of this technique for treatment of cancer,\" he said.</p> <p>A Hunstanton charity has supported families who want to try SPDT in Mexico, including the Downies. It was also involved subsequently in the appeal for money to bring her home. \"There is evidence that it works,\" says Linza Corp, who runs Families Against Neuroblastoma (FAN). \"It is a very inexpensive, non-invasive therapy. Unfortunately not many people have gone through it, so we have got little evidence. But there are a couple of children we are supporting and although they are still very, very poorly, they are still here.\"</p> <p>She cites the case of Connah Broom, an 11-year-old boy with neuroblastoma who went to Mexico for PDT and whose secondary tumours \u2013 but not the original one in his abdomen \u2013 are said to have gone. His GP, Dr Eamonn Jessup from Prestatyn Central Surgery, has said that although there has been remarkable improvement, he cannot be sure what caused it. \"Whether it is the health regime they are following for Connah, whether it is the treatments they are following, I don't know,\" <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-north-east-wales-15974631\" title=\"\">he told the BBC</a> last December. \"It is right that as scientists, which is what doctors are, we have to be sceptical about new treatments.\"</p> <p>The downside to the publicity that resulted in funds to bring Olivia Downie home, Corp said, \"is that people are going to think perhaps it doesn't work. The reality of that is that Olivia was dying before she ever set foot on the plane. We knew that.\"</p> <p>It would have taken a miracle for Olivia to get better, she said, but added that \"there was hope\" because the Mexican clinic was willing to accept her for treatment. \"We are not a medical panel. We are a charity that facilitates a parent's choice.\"</p> <p>Corp's own son, Max, died from neuroblastoma while she was trying to organise treatment for him in New York. \"When a child is dying in your arms you will do everything to try and save them,\" she said.</p> <p>She took him for a brain scan while he was in a coma because she needed to have him certified fit to fly. \"The result of that MRI scan showed he had something like 22 tumours within his brain and spinal cord and that there was no way in the world now that he could be saved and I must have spent half an hour shouting \"just sign the fucking form\", because I thought it doesn't matter to you \u2013 just let me do this. I'm his mum - I want to do this.\"</p> <p>Corp also cites Bobby Wright as a survivor of neuroblastoma, supposedly as a result of an organic diet and supplements (following conventional treatment). FAN's website recommends a consultation with the organisation set up by Bobby's father, Kevin Wright, called Kids Integrated Cancer Therapy, \"as early in treatment as possible\". Wright, however, has been charged with nine counts of fraud and 11 of theft, mostly relating to donations for his son's treatment, and will appear at Nottingham crown court in the autumn.</p> <p>David Longman, of Killing Cancer, says the government should be helping parents navigate their way around the claims made by clinics abroad. \"What I find completely odious is that the Department of Health will give us no guidance whatsoever,\" he said. The Foreign Office gives advice to travellers about potential hazards abroad, so why shouldn't the Department of Health do something similar? he asks.</p> <p>Cancer Research UK does attempt to give general advice. \"Treatment in hospitals in the UK is evidence based. We would recommend that people are extremely cautious about accepting any treatment that has not been through rigorous clinical trials that demonstrate its safety and effectiveness,\" said Martin Ledwick, the organistation's head information nurse</p>",

  "<p>As a child I was riveted by other people's mothers: their air of being possessed \u2013 perhaps even imprisoned \u2013 by their lives constituted a kind of two-way mirror through which I could see them without, it seemed, being seen myself. I lacked this facility with my own mother: not only could I not truly see her, or see her whole, but she seemed to know things about me that I was not aware of having made public. At home the struggle to establish and defend the boundary of self was interior, whereas with other people's mothers everything was accomplished by a mutual reading of surfaces which, if occasionally awkward, offered much more in the way of entertainment. One could lie, for instance, without appearing to be found out; but most of all one could view in safety the maternal persona itself, which more than any other was exposed by the forms it took, so that it seemed there was nothing you couldn't find out about someone else's mother simply by looking. She expressed herself in everything, from the food on the table to the washing on the line, was intimately revealed in every room of the house, a creature entirely given over to outward impressions both sensory and actual \u2013 a person, in fact, with no privacy. While staying at a schoolfriend's house I was taken as a matter of course to view the marital bed, and was solemnly shown, as well as the items on her mother's dressing table and the contents of her underwear drawer, a tennis ball attached to a length of rope which lay beneath her mother's pillow. She wore it, it was explained to me, around her neck at night, in order to prevent her from disturbing her husband by lying on her back and snoring.</p> <p>If there are two distinct kinds of mother \u2013 other people's and one's own \u2013 then this is a distinction reflected at the core of human nature, between ourselves as objective and subjective beings. Objectivity is the goal of civilisation, an aspiration rooted in the struggle to be objective about oneself. Psychoanalysis might be seen as the attempt to abridge this process, but for most people it is by the slow and iterative business of living that they approach a more dispassionate standpoint. A woman stuck at home with small children might for the first time be able to see that fierce deity, her mother, as a woman stuck at home with small children; but she is still some way from transposing a difficult mother into something that doesn't define or threaten the parameters of her own conduct. One can be a difficult mother and have a difficult mother, both at the same time: certain artists have the gift of clear sightedness in that particular hall of mirrors, but generally it's a question of trying not to repeat what was done to you while never quite knowing what it is you're meant to be&#xa0;doing.</p> <p>Retrospect is no guide, despite the soft-psychoanalytic suggestion that one can become a better person by understanding the ways in which one was wronged. And as Terri Apter demonstrates in <em>Difficult Mothers</em>, the impulse to attain greater objectivity about formative experience can simply result in more entrenched subjectivity. In her introduction, Apter mentions a female friend and colleague who warned her against writing her book for precisely this reason. Mothers are blamed for everything, the friend says, and thus their perspective is dispensed with. Once a difficult mother becomes \"difficult mothers\" \u2013 once the particular problem is permitted to become generic \u2013 the two-way mirror is shattered and the battle for a more objective glimpse of our genesis is lost.</p> <p>\"It comes without warning. I turn my gaze out my office window, anticipating one of those exquisitely private moments when memories and long-term musings sweep away the deliberations of the day. Instead, I suddenly chill to memories of my mother's angry breath and feel its rhythm in my own heartbeat.\" These are Apter's opening lines: with their telling reliance on uncorroborated thought-scapes and physical symptoms, they demonstrate the reverse procedure of subjective \"truth\", whereby the personal does not become the universal but rather its opposite, forced to retreat to within its own strict boundary, the body.</p> <p>Nonetheless, I left <em>Difficult Mothers</em> lying around the house, in case my children should be interested. It assigns mothers into categories \u2013 controlling, narcissistic, envious, unavailable \u2013 from which one feels somewhat forced to choose, though presumably as in the ice-cream parlour there's no law against having more than one kind at once. Afterwards one is invited to ask the question \"Am I a difficult mother?\", so perhaps it's best not to over-indulge. I found my thoughts straying to Oedipus, who was far from rehabilitated by such lines of enquiry. Indeed, it might be that in discovering one's parents to be mere humans, and one's sufferings, ambitions and darkest drives to have been generated by people not wicked but just hapless or hopeless \u2013 themselves the children of Larkin's fools in old style hats and coats \u2013 one loses something in the way of self-importance and belief and becomes, like Oedipus, someone of no fixed purpose or abode. The great <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Miller_%28psychologist%29\" title=\"\">Alice Miller</a> took a hard line on such circular thinking: don't start feeling sorry for the grown-ups, she said. After Freud and Winnicott and Klein, she recognised that in the great mapping out of childhood reality there had to be a boundary somewhere.</p> <p>Apter is one of many writers drawn to that new country, busily extracting and disseminating simplified versions of its precepts. She herself may not be ignorant, but she presumes ignorance in her readers, and is occasionally guilty of claiming that she has charted virgin psychoanalytic territory. \"Instead of 'good' versus 'bad' mother,\" she writes as an instance, \"I use the term 'good-enough' mother\"; not exactly taking credit for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Winnicott\" title=\"\">Winnicott</a>'s famous phrase, but not attributing it to its author either. One might define a difficult mother as one who substitutes personal for actual truth, who interposes her own reality in a way that blocks or interferes with the child's view of \"reality\" itself. With her personalising of what were intended to be universal tools of self-knowledge, Apter oddly exhibits a version of such characteristics. In a writer such strategies are not exactly bad, but they're probably not good enough.</p> <p>\u2022 Rachel Cusk's <em>Aftermath</em> is published by Faber.</p>",

  "<p>It is the \"restricted\" official document that sums up the Metropolitan police's tactics towards Julian Assange. \"Action required: Assange to be arrested under all circumstances,\" says the handwritten note that was photographed under a policeman's arm on Friday detailing a \"summary of the current position\" on Assange's exile inside the Ecuadorean embassy in Knightsbridge.</p> <p>It is no surprise that a fugitive from a European arrest warrant that demands removal to Sweden to face allegations of rape and sexual assault should face such a fate. Police officers are stationed right up against the front and back of the embassy where Assange has sought sanctuary and he recently claimed to have heard them \"swarming\" behind the fire escape.</p> <p>There should be no escape, the note suggests, ordering that Assange is arrested if \"he comes out with dip [presumably a diplomat] ... as dip bag [which allows immunity from search for diplomatic communications, and which could be as large as a suitcase, crate or even a shipping container], in dip car .... in dip vehicle.\"</p> <p>The note mentions \"SS10 to liaise\". The Met police press office said it had no idea what this might mean. Could it be a misspelling of SO10, the colloquial name for the Met's covert operations group? The later mention of SO20 suggests what Assange and his supporters have always feared: that the western powers that WikiLeaks has done so much to embarrass might consider him some sort of terrorist. SO20 is the Met's counter-terrorism protective security command.</p> <p>However, on Friday night the Met said the reference to SO20 was not connected to the Assange case and were notes from a briefing on another matter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395185284\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/24/1345829694710/Julian-Assange-arrest-tac-001.jpg\" alt=\"Julian Assange arrest tactics\" width=\"460\" height=\"700\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Close-up view of the police strategy.

  "<p>With 227 athletes competing across 19 sports, the US Paralympics team for London 2012 will be one of the strongest to ever compete at the Games, joining competitors from around the world to make up a field of 4,200 \u2013 up from 3,951 in Beijing. The US team will be aiming to beat their medal haul from 2008, when they finished third overall by winning 99 medals. </p> <p>Will they achieve their goal after the Games begin on 29 August? Here is a look at some of the likeliest medal contenders and some of the more extraordinary stories among those taking part.</p> <h2>Jessica Long (swimming)</h2> <p>The golden girl of the US swim team won three gold medals in Athens in 2004 \u2013 <em>as a 12-year-old</em> \u2013 then promptly won four more plus a silver and a bronze in Beijing, collecting numerous world records on the way. Now coming into her prime, she is a strong favorite for more medals in London, having won seven events at the Paralympic trials earlier this year.</p> <p>Long has had a remarkable journey. Born in Siberia and adopted from a Russian orphanage at just 13 months old, she suffered from fibular hemimelia, meaning she was born without fibulas, ankles, heels and most of the other bones in her feet. At 18 months her legs were amputated below the knees, so she could be fitted with prosthetics in order to walk. Long learned to swim in her grandparent's swimming pool and joined her first swim team at the age of 10. An obvious star, she is a two-time ESPY winner for Best Female Athlete with a Disability, including this year's award.</p> <p>Here she is winning gold in 2008:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ly6vd9RWkhw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ly6vd9RWkhw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>Bradley Snyder (swimming)</h2> <p>Snyder is one of 20 US military veterans and active-duty service members taking part in these games. Having lost his vision in an IED attack in Afghanistan in September 2011, Snyder is scheduled to compete on the first anniversary of his injury. </p> <p>Snyder comes from a sporting family \u2013 his brother Mitchell was an NCAA Division II swimming champion. Mitchell also served as Bradley's \"tapper\" at the Paralympic trials, touching his shoulder with a stick to warn him of impending turns. </p> <p>Snyder's performance in those trials was extraordinary. In his top event, the 400m freestyle, he needed to exceed his personal best by 41sec to qualify for the Games \u2013 an extraordinary margin in competitive swimming of any stripe. In the event he went 54sec faster, in world-record time for fully blind swimmers and only 1.5sec behind his time over the distance at the naval academy seven years earlier.</p> <h2>Oksana Masters (rowing)</h2> <p>Oksana Masters may now be best known for <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/espn/photos/gallery/_/id/8136693/image/25/oksana-masters-2012-body-issue-bodies-want-espn-magazine\">baring all in ESPN's Body Issue</a> this summer, but the 2012 World Cup winner hopes to change that in London \u2013 rowing with her mixed doubles partner, Rob Jones (who rows with two prosthetic legs \u2013 like Bradley Snyder, he was injured in an IED attack in Afghanistan). The pair won the World Cup in Serbia to qualify for these games, beating the fancied Brazilians.</p> <p>Masters has been rowing since the age of 13, having been adopted by a US family from an orphanage in the Ukraine at the age of 7. Her home village had been close to a nuclear power plant and she is a bilateral above-knee amputee, as the result of in utero radiation poisoning. Masters has achieved several firsts an adaptive rowing \u2013 often competing in and winning open singles races against slide-seat rowers at events around the US.</p> <h2>Blake Leeper (100m)</h2> <p>If you've been following the build-up to these games, Leeper may be a familiar face \u2013 he was the International Paralympic Committee's athlete of the month for July. </p> <p>Leeper burst on to the scene in 2009, when he won the 100m, 200m and 400m at the Endeavour Games. This was all despite still learning how to position his new prosthetics in the starting blocks \u2013 a 2008 Challenged Athlete Foundation had bought him the same Ossur Cheetahs that are famously used by Oscar Pistorius. </p> <p>The South African star is the 22-year-old Leeper's target in London \u2013 as well as his US teammate Jerome Singleton, who beat Pistorius at the 2011 World Championships. That was the first time the \"Blade Runner\" had been beaten in the event for seven years.</p> <h2>Monica Bascio (handcycling)</h2> <p>A 15-time US handcycling champion, Bascio comes into these games off a less than ideal preparation, having tested positive for tuaminoheptane after a World Cup event in Rome in May. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/15/us-paralympics-cyclist-monica-bascio-doping\">A three-month retroactive ban for the infraction expires just in time for her to compete in London</a>. </p> <p>The relatively light nature of the punishment related to the fact that Bascio took the substance in over-the-counter medication; the US Anti-Doping Agency applied the discretionary reduced sanction which becomes available in cases when the agency can \"establish the source of the substance and prove there was no intent to enhance sport performance or mask the use of a performance-enhancing substance\".</p> <p>Bascio has been a formidable handcyclist over the last decade, including winning the toughest race in the world, the 267-mile Sadler's Alaska Challenge, an astonishing five times. She has also competed at the 2006 and 2010 Paralympic Winter Games as a skier \u2013 it was a skiing accident that set her on the path to becoming a Paralympian. </p> <p>Bascio will now try to focus on an injury-free shot at a handcycling medal. When women's handcycling was finally included in the summer Games, in Beijing, she was hampered by a recovery from injury and could not add to the US team's total of 14 cycling medals, five of them gold.</p> <h2>Josh Olson (shooting)</h2> <p>Paralympic history will be made in the London shooting competition. Sgt. 1st Class Josh Olson, a member of the US Army Marksmanship Unit at Fort Benning in Columbus, will become the first active serviceman to take part. He will participate in two events \u2013 the mixed 10m air rifle and the mixed 50m prone rifle.</p> <p>After a rocket-propelled grenade attack in Iraq in October 2003, Olson lost his right leg. He spent 18 months in rehab, but a near-perfect clay target score during an occupational therapy session inspired him to try to stay in the army, with the Marksmanship Unit. </p> <p>Established in 1956, the 120-strong unit shoots competitively around the world \u2013 as a member, Olson became the first athlete with a disability to be nominated for the Army's World Class Athlete program. This year he has been training with other members of the unit, including competitive Olympians who have just returned from London. Olson's success has also contributed to the fact that the Marksmanship Unit now plans to add 24 wounded soldiers as instructors and competitive shooters from this October.</p> <h2>Tatyana McFadden, (wheelchair racing)</h2> <p>Known by her teammates as \"Beast\", McFadden will compete over an extraordinary range of wheelchair racing events \u2013 from the 100m to the marathon. At the age of 23<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/19/tatyana-mcfadden-paralympics-wheelchair-racing\"> she is a veteran Paralympian</a>, having won four silvers and two bronzes over the course of the last two Games, but of late she has come in to her own, winning the New York marathon in 2010 and the Chicago Marathon last year. In 2011, she also won four world championship golds.</p> <p>Like Masters, McFadden came from an orphanage in a country that had been part of the former Soviet Union. She was adopted at the age of 6 by the then commissioner of disabilities for the US health department, Debbie McFadden. Tatyana was born with spina bifida and was paralysed as the result of the impairment on spinal development caused by the condition. Her St Petersburg orphanage did not have a wheelchair for her to use, but after her adoption she was encouraged to become more active in order to build her strength. She then gravitated towards competitive sports and, ultimately, wheelchair racing.</p> <h2>Joe Delagrave (wheelchair rugby)</h2> <p>Joe Delagrave may not have been part of the US team that took gold in 2008, but as the 2012 national player of the year he may have a significant say in whether the US can repeat their feat. </p> <p>In the most bruising event in the games, the 6ft 5in former college football tight end will go into the tournament using his fifth wheelchair in as many years \u2013 the previous four having been wrecked beyond the expertise of the team's resident welder by the one game that allows \u2013 indeed seems to actively encourage \u2013 contact between wheelchairs.</p> <p>Despite the surface brutality that has earned the sport its nickname of \"murderball\", there is a strong tactical element to wheelchair rugby. The sport operates a classification system according to degree and nature of disability, with scores ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 \u2013 the latter is awarded to competitors with complete arm use, full trunk and ability in both hands. The combined points total for the four players on a team cannot exceed 8.0. </p> <p>Where the US is strong is in the number of fast competitors they have whose classification is 2.0 \u2013 they will be one of the teams to beat in London.</p> <h2>Jen Armbruster (goalball)</h2> <p>This will be an extraordinary sixth Paralympics for Armbruster, as she seeks to help the USA defend the gold medal they won in Beijing and tries to add to a medal tally that includes silver in Athens and bronze in Atlanta. </p> <p>Since losing her sight at the age of 14, Armbruster has been playing goalball, often under the guidance of her father, Ken, the US team coach. The game is played on a volleyball court with goals at each end, with players taking turns to hurl a 3-pound ball filled with bells towards the opponents' goal \u2013 or defending their goal with lateral dives across court. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DNc6q9EvYK0?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DNc6q9EvYK0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>.</p> <p>As well as being a staple of the US team for two decades, Armbruster has been an emblematic athlete for the US Paralympics team. She was the flag bearer for the 2008 games.</p> <h2>Myles Porter (Judo)</h2> <p>Having finished fifth in Beijing, despite being a relative latecomer to judo after taking it up at the University of Toledo, Myles Porter has been making up for lost time, reaching high national standings in both the Paralympic and sighted versions of the sport, despite the differences in rules and moves between the two codes. He has reached as high as No3 in the men's 100kg sighted division.</p> <p>The most notable breakthrough for Porter, though, was his defeat of the current Paralympic champion, the four-time gold medalist Ant\u00f4nio Ten\u00f3rio da Silva of Brazil, at the 2011 Parapan American Games. That victory was widely seen as a marker of Porter's progress in advance of London and a real confidence boost in advance of the Games.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AJOCScwcFsw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AJOCScwcFsw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>.</p>",
  "<p>Adam Hills thinks \"mutant\" is a much better word than \"disabled\". \"It sounds so much cooler,\" he says with a broad smile. At a press launch earlier in the year for Channel 4's coverage of the Paralympics, he introduced the minister for disabilities as \"the minister for mutants\". \"And then Channel 4 came out with its Meet the Superhumans ad campaign. Superhumans! I think it stole it from me \u2026 it took mutant and made it sound even cooler.\" The problem with the word disabled is that it has so many negative connotations, he says. \"And I&#xa0;don't think people who are considered disabled think about themselves as being disabled. Even when people talk about my disability, for a number of reasons I feel weird. There's nothing I&#xa0;can't do, so technically I don't think I&#xa0;am disabled, I don't think I count.\"</p> <p>During the Paralympics, Hills is presenting a nightly comedy show called The Last Leg. Disability and comedy have rarely succeeded on TV together. This week, I'm Spazticus, Channel 4's prank show featuring a cast of actors with disabilities <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/culture/scottharris/100065959/im-spazticus-isnt-offensive-and-it-isnt-ground-breaking-its-just-awful/\" title=\"\">received a&#xa0;largely negative response</a>. And it is not as if there isn't an increasingly large number of comics with disabilities \u2013 Francesca Martinez, Laurence Clark, Lee Ridley, Steve Day \u2013 working on really great stuff on the circuit.</p> <p>But still, I wonder if a Paralympics comedy show is appropriate \u2013 doesn't it&#xa0;send the message that it is a kind of novelty sideshow to the \"real\" Olympics?</p> <p>\"I think it is appropriate because [it can be] funny, and most Paralympians think it is,\" says Hills, who was born without a right foot and wears a prosthesis. \"They joke about it. It's funny to walk into a&#xa0;room full of disabled people.\"</p> <p>I think I&#xa0;must have a&#xa0;puzzled expression because he explains that he went to the&#xa0;closing night party at the Beijing Paralympics, which he was covering for Australian television. \"You've got a guy in a wheelchair snogging a girl with dwarfism, you've got a blind guy chatting up a girl with cerebral palsy. It's funny \u2013 not as in mocking or going, 'These people look ridiculous' \u2013 it's joyous funny, something to be celebrated. With comedy and&#xa0;disability people go, 'Ooh, where's the&#xa0;line?' There is no line \u2013 if you're celebrating, then you won't say the wrong thing. As long as it comes from the place of going 'This is great'. And it is, it's an amazing sporting event. I think because everyone behind the show loves the Paralympics, we get it, we've seen a lot of Paralympic sports and we've all gone beyond that [he puts on an insipid voice], 'Oh isn't this inspiring' and instead gone, 'This guy's awesome. It's about the sport really.\"</p> <p>Does he think there are still a lot of patronising attitudes about Paralympic athletes, that kind of cloying triumph-over-adversity angle? \"Oh definitely. But&#xa0;there is triumph over adversity \u2013 the&#xa0;great thing about the Paralympics is&#xa0;that everyone has a story. Except for the people born with disabilities. They're boring.\" He laughs. \"'What's your story?' 'I was born without a foot' 'Dull. Move on.' I think it makes them more accessible. You watch Usain Bolt \u2013 he's clearly got an amazing gift and it's been nurtured and trained and he has done nothing else but do that since he was a kid. I can't connect with that. Then you see someone, for instance someone like Martine Wright [the sitting&#xa0;volleyball player] who lost her legs in the 7/7 bombing \u2013 a person on their way to work, they've lost their legs&#xa0;and they've pushed themselves and&#xa0;they've done this. It's actually easier to relate to that than some of the Olympians I think.\"</p> <p>We sit in the garden of a cafe near his&#xa0;north London flat, where Hills lives&#xa0;with his wife Ali, an opera singer, and their two-year-old daughter. At 42, he has been a comedian for more than 20 years; better known in his native Australia, where he presented a television music show, he has steadily been building a large British fanbase, appearing on TV panel shows and touring his act, most recently at the Edinburgh festival.</p> <p>Hills grew up in a Sydney suburb. His parents were told not to treat him any differently from his brother. \"'If he falls over, let him pick himself up',\" he says. \"They enrolled me in gymnastics classes from a young age, I started playing tennis early on. I became relatively sporty and nothing stopped me. I still played football and cricket and ran around. It wasn't as if I sat on the sidelines and couldn't do what the other kids did.\"</p> <p>His father worked for Qantas, and his first exposure to comedy was on a flight. \"I found the comedy channel and I was blown away that there was someone being funny on the radio,\" he says. \"It was Victor Borge and it was a routine about how punctuation in speech should have noises, so you know when someone is doing a comma. I became entranced by it. Because I listened to it over and over, I heard the cadence and the rhythm.\" He sought out his dad's Peter Sellers and Bill Cosby albums. \"And I started listening to Billy Connolly and Robin Williams. I would quote them word for word at school. but I never really thought of it as a viable career path.\"</p> <p>At university, where he was studying to be a journalist, he went with a friend to the Sydney Comedy Store, where an open mic night was on. \"When I did my first gig I thought, 'This is it'.\" He started working as a stagehand at a TV station, then applied to be a comedy writer on a&#xa0;radio breakfast show. There, he started performing his characters on the radio, and was soon snapped up as a breakfast show co-host. Offered his own show in another city, Hills realised he had to make the decision between radio and stand-up. He chose stand-up.</p> <p>What did he like about it? He thinks for a moment. \"I like the way I feel when I'm on stage,\" he says.\" There's a quote I&#xa0;once read, I think from Bono of all people, something like: 'In real life, I'm not the person I ideally want to be, but when I'm on stage that's the closest I&#xa0;get.' It's the same for me. When I'm on stage, it's the closest I get to the person I&#xa0;wish I was every day \u2013 positive, interested in people, everything I say I&#xa0;have thought about, nothing rattles me. I feel in the moment, relaxed, happy.\"</p> <p>In recent years, Hills' shows have been based on audience interaction, something he describes as \"a very liberated way of performing. You walk out on stage and have no idea what's going to happen. Also there is a different laugh you get from an ad-libbed moment \u2013 the audience can tell something has happened that no other audience will ever see again, so the laugh is bigger and more of a release.\" His shows have also become notable for being among the few with a regular sign-language interpreter, which means he has won a&#xa0;large number of deaf fans.</p> <p>Last month, he performed at a Muppets gala show in Montreal; Kermit said they should \"rough that guy up and make him a Muppet\", but I believe he is the closest a human can get to a Muppet. He is gentle and expressive, his face permanently creased into a smile.</p> <p>His extreme niceness is something that is often picked up by reviewers. One called his comedy \"celebratory, sun-drenched humour\". He seems happy with the tag (he seems happy with everything). \"I remember an early gig in Adelaide, where I was compering, and talking to a load of butchers [in the audience],\" he says. \"I&#xa0;started putting them down, doing jokes about them. I&#xa0;brought on the next act and the crowd turned on them. I&#xa0;thought, 'Why is there so much negative energy in the room? Oh God, because I put it there.' There was no reason for me to talk down to them, it&#xa0;was purely because that's what I&#xa0;thought you did in comedy.\" (Around the same time, his father watched a recording of Hills' material and stormed out, saying it was \"filth\".) \"Now, whenever I talk to the audience, I'm not going to put people down. I'm going to lift them. I want them to leave feeling better than they felt when they came in.\"</p> <p>Does he worry that credibility comes only&#xa0;from performing edgy material? \"I&#xa0;did for a while. I guess I used to think,&#xa0;'Will I&#xa0;just be considered a crowdpleaser?' The 'nice' tag is always bandied around, but I really don't care about credibility any more. I think you go through that stage, you want to be respected by your peers, you want people to say, 'You have to go and see&#xa0;Adam, the things he is saying!' Eventually you go, 'It doesn't matter.' We all work best when we do our own thing and don't compare ourselves to any other comedians.\"</p> <p>He has just returned from the Edinburgh festival. I ask him how he feels about the focus on misogynistic comedians and the rise of the so-called rape \"joke\". \"A lot of people are talking about that but there are some wonderful shows there \u2013 Tony Law's beautiful, nonsensical, silly, almost childish show is just one. The 'rapey' comedians are getting the attention, but the real comedy that is going on up there, probably the next wave of comedy, are people like him and Felicity Ward, and some of the sketch shows. My theory is it's gone as offensive as you can get and it's going to start swinging back. For me, it's all about what you're actually saying. If all you're doing is making a joke about rape, that's not funny to me. There are things to be said about rape, and you have to be doing [a joke about it] for a reason \u2013 you can't just be going, 'Ha ha, I&#xa0;just made a joke about rape.' There can&#xa0;be a guilty pleasure at laughing at something you're not meant to laugh at, but it can tip over into hate.\"</p> <p>Jokes about disability follow the same principle, he says. \"Of course I don't think we should laugh at people if it's purely because they've got a disability \u2013 there has to be a reason behind it. If you're just a guy in a wheelchair going, 'Look at me, I'm in a wheelchair, aren't I&#xa0;funny?' I'm not sure that's empowering anyone. When I started talking about my foot on stage, there had to be a reason for it. My foot always set off metal detectors at airports. After September 11, they'd go, 'We need to check', but when I said it was an artificial foot they didn't want to offend me and they would go, 'I'm sorry mate, go, go.' Part of me would be going, 'Dude, check, there could be a knife!' I&#xa0;want to know the plane is safe, I don't want know that some guy could pretend to have an artificial foot and get on with a&#xa0;knife. I talked about that on stage, and the point of that was: don't be scared. Don't worry if you ask what happened and I tell you and you say, 'Oh god, I'm&#xa0;so sorry.' There's nothing to be sorry&#xa0;about.\"</p> <p>He remembers the comedian Phil Kay asking him about his foot. \"His first question was, 'Are you all right with it?' And I&#xa0;went&#xa0;yeah, and he went 'good'. That's basically all people want to know when they see someone with a disability \u2013 'are you OK with it because I feel bad for you?'. I think that's why the Paralympics is wonderful because you see a guy with one leg walk down to the pool and take his leg off and you go, 'Oh, I hope he's all right with it.' And then you see him swim an amazing time, far faster than you could ever do, and you go, 'Yeah, he's fine'.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The </em><a href=\"http://paralympics.channel4.com/the-team/presenter=AdamHills/\" title=\"\"><em>Last Leg is on Channel 4 </em></a><em>at 10.30pm&#xa0;every night during the Paralympic Games</em></p>",
  "<p>Oslo district court and the Norwegian justice system are to be congratulated on the way they conducted the trial of the worst killer in the country's history. The court named 174 lawyers to protect the interests of Anders Behring Breivik's victims. The judges heard the autopsy reports of each of the 77 people killed in his rampage and each of the injuries sustained by the 242 wounded, the amputations and the comas they endured. Time given to the bereaved and the survivors did not come at the expense of the legal rights of Breivik, who testified for over a week. While Breivik's court appearance was all part of his meticulously prepared act of mass murder, the court held firm to its, and our, unshakeable belief in the rule of law. This was no military tribunal on Guantanamo Bay. This was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/23/opinion/at-breivik-trial-a-chance-for-norway-to-heal.html\" title=\"\">an open trial in an open society</a>.</p> <p>The court was also right to<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/24/breivik-verdict-sane-21-years\" title=\"\"> declare Breivik sane</a>. An act which is by definition insane can be carried out by a person acting rationally, bearing full responsibility for what he did. Breivik's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/24/anders-behring-breivik-profile-oslo\" title=\"\">attention to detail</a> in planning the two attacks on July 22 2011 was chilling. He moved to a farm big enough to buy fertiliser for without attracting attention. But it was isolated enough to ensure the total privacy he needed to make his bomb. He had the idea of calling on ahead to the organisers of the Labour party's youth camp on the island of Ut\u00f8ya to persuade them that he was a policemen sent over to protect them in the aftermath of the bombing he had just committed in Oslo. They sent over the ferry to pick him up. The man who came off that ferry was equipped with more than just the physical means to kill. He had mentally prepared himself as a killer, desensitising himself in a year-long computer game session firing at human targets in realistic conditions over and over again. Training soldiers to kill involves overcoming a powerful resistance to killing one's own kind. Breivik was sane.</p> <p>Breivik leaves free society in Norway \u2013 he will surely never be let out again \u2013 with an enduring legacy. It is one which the country will be reminded of every July 22 for generations to come, but one with which it has yet to come to terms: it is what Breivik stood for. Breivik did more than just shatter Norway's self-image as a peaceful country, a place where it is safe to send your children to a summer camp, the home of the Nobel peace prize, the country confident enough to think it can mediate other countries' intractable problems. He made the Islamophobia of the far right impossible to ignore.</p> <p>Here Norway's record in the 13 months since the attacks is mixed. As the former prime minister Thorbj\u00f8rn Jagland said, Breivik may have dampened the anti-multicultural rhetoric of the far right, but the sentiment itself <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/22/norway-anders-breivik-verdict-nears\" title=\"\">remains</a>. The attack has galvanised recruitment to the Labour party's youth wing, but the anti-immigrant Progress party has also steadily clawed back support. A national debate which dealt almost obsessively on the details of Breivik's attack has yet to address its political causes. For rightwing politicians and anti-immigrant websites in Norway, its very much <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/16/anders-breivik-toxic-legacy?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">business as usual</a>.</p> <p>The core of Breivik's ideology, that Islam poses a threat to Europeans and Norwegians alike, is shared by the English Defence League, by Pam Geller and Robert Spencer, America's biggest Muslim-haters, and by many others around Europe. Their rally in Stockholm to create a global \"counter-jihad\" was a flop \u2013 only 200 attended. But all the parties of the far right agree on the perceived risk of multiculturalism and view Muslim demographic change in Europe as a challenge. Racism based on biology may be being replaced by one based on culture. It is unlikely that another Breivik in the making is conditioning himself in another isolated house somewhere else in Europe, but it is not impossible. The ideas which created Breivik have yet to be confronted. That is as much a European as it is a Norwegian problem.</p>",
  "<p>What trouble beckons for men when they talk to women. Not all men, of course. But for a certain breed of male politician, it seems the territory marked \"women's issues\" is a minefield.</p> <p>That did not stop three of them wading in with clumsy boots this week, one cretinously, another creepily and the third recklessly. The cretin was Todd Akin, would-be Republican senator for Missouri, author of the novel idea that a woman's body automatically prevents itself from becoming pregnant through rape \u2013 but only if the rape is \"legitimate\". It was an absurd word to use, as he tried to distinguish between sex involving a violent stranger and other forms of coercive, non-consensual sex - all of them rape \u2013 but he was not the first to do it. His party's vice-presidential nominee, Paul Ryan, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/08/ryan-refuses-to-explain-forcible-rape-as-dems-attempt-more-akin-izing-of-the-gop-ticket/\" title=\"\">co-sponsored legislation last year to deny federal funding for all abortions</a>, with an exception for pregnancies resulting from incest and \"forcible rape\" \u2013 implying this was the only form of rape that matters. Our very own Ken Clarke made a similar distinction when he <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13444770\" title=\"\">spoke last year</a> of \"serious rape\", as if there were any other kind.</p> <p>With Ryan for company, Akin might have got away with it. But his <a href=\"http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/08/todd-akin-legitimate-rape.php\" title=\"\">middle ages notion</a> that \"the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down\" was too much for his party leadership. Apparently too much for the voters too. Last week Akin led by nine points,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/23/todd-akin-10-points-behind?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\"> now he trails by 10</a>.</p> <p>The creepy intervention came with George Galloway's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/20/george-galloway-julian-assange-rape\" title=\"\">video defence</a> of Julian Assange. In language that made the flesh crawl, Galloway offered this dissertation on sexual consent: \"I mean, not everybody needs to be asked prior to each insertion,\" adding that Assange's accusers could fault him at most for \"bad sexual etiquette\". The name of the Bradford MP's weekly online broadcast \u2013 Good Night with George Galloway \u2013 suddenly acquired a whole new meaning.</p> <p>At least the Respect MP refrained from naming Assange's alleged victims. No such restraint for Craig Murray, a former British diplomat, who denounced one of them by name on Newsnight, violating the British legal scruple that holds that a woman who may have suffered the trauma of rape should at least be granted basic privacy.</p> <p>What these three episodes have in common is how much they seem to reveal about the speaker. It's easy enough for politicians to maintain the mask when speaking about, say, tax or industrial policy. But get them on to these fundamental matters of how men and women relate to each other and their character starts showing.</p> <p>Usually it's more subtle. David Cameron had done well to position himself as a different kind of Conservative, a modern husband and conscientious father. But when he told Labour's Angela Eagle to \"Calm down, dear\" or, worse, when he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/wintour-and-watt/2011/sep/07/abortion-davidcameron\" title=\"\">joked</a> that his backbench Tory critic Nadine Dorries was \"frustrated\", he let slip the persona his aides have worked so hard to conceal: Flashman, public school bully. Similarly, George W Bush could not hide his inner frat boy when he ambushed Angela Merkel at a summit and gave her what was clearly an unwanted <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/tv/w/001109/\" title=\"\">shoulder massage</a>.</p> <p>Such things matter in politics, if only because women \u2013 so under-represented among politicians \u2013 account for too large a share of the electorate to offend without cost. As one US observer quipped, \"Could Akin win a senate seat with 0% of the women's vote?\" The answer is no, because no one could. That effect is maximised if a gender gap opens up and, especially, if women become more motivated than men to vote. In the US, 1992 was hailed as the \"year of the woman\", because a series of senate elections were swung by an apparent surge in female voters, determined to oust those male incumbents who had revealed dinosaur attitudes when supreme court nominee Clarence Thomas was accused of past sexual harassment.</p> <p>The modest conclusion the male politician would draw from this would be a variation on the Hippocratic oath: do no harm. But beyond avoiding outright offence, what else is a male politician to do? On this, 57 varieties of nonsense are regularly spouted, often framed in the awkward terms of romance, with male politicians seeking to court, seduce or woo the female electorate. Some assume that a male candidate needs to appeal to women the way a potential husband might, as attractive, capable and trustworthy. One ardently feminist colleague notes how women regularly make political choices that \"give feminism a bad name\", backing alpha male types who subliminally, she says, signal \"they'd be able to bring the bison back to the cave\".</p> <p>But it might be simpler than that. \"It's all about empathy and understanding expressed through policy rather than conduct,\" says one seasoned pollster. Mitt Romney's flip-flopping position on abortion rights \u2013 once for them, now against \u2013 matters more than his long, faithful marriage. Women stood by Bill Clinton despite everything, because his record on the issues that mattered to them was solid.</p> <p>Indeed, Clinton is the exemplar. The Monica Lewinsky episode should have sunk him. But he had passed a Family and Medical Leave Act that addressed the reality of many women's lives; he acted to \"mend, not end\" affirmative action; he crafted a neat formula supporting abortion that was \"safe, legal and rare\", and appointed a cabinet that, in his words, \"looked like America\", with women in senior positions. The substance of all that outweighed the sleaze that was to follow.</p> <p>If it's policy that matters, that cuts both ways. It means no one blinked when Barack Obama called a female reporter \"sweetie\", but that photos of Cameron pushing a buggy count for nought when set against cuts to public sector jobs that disproportionately affect female workers, and to the tax credits on which many women depend.</p> <p>There are lessons for the Tories here. One is that if Cameron has a gender problem, the solution lies in policy, not PR. Louise Mensch's <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9490212/George-Galloway-Todd-Akin-and-other-male-politicians-still-getting-it-wrong-on-rape.html\" title=\"\">suggestion</a> of a woman at the Ministry of Justice is sensible if that adds not merely a female face, but a voice who gets heard when decisions are taken.</p> <p>Labour should draw similar conclusions: it's the substance that counts. But that doesn't preclude seizing the odd tactical advantage. One might be the more frequent deployment of Yvette Cooper: for there is no quicker way to wrongfoot a man clumsy in these matters than have him face a woman.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/j_freedland\" title=\"\"><em>@j_freedland</em></a></p>",
  "<p>The summer of 2012 has sadly been colored with several high-profile mass shootings.

There are <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/18/opinion/18herbert.html\">approximately 100,000 shootings</a> in the US every year, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/jan/10/gun-crime-us-state\">nearly 9,000 of those</a> are fatal. Homicide is, in fact, the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db37.htm\">leading cause of death</a> among non-Hispanic black male adolescents: these are gun crime's less visible victims.</p> <p>Most gun violence receives far less media attention than the mass shootings have this summer. Friday's shooting near the Empire State Building in the heart of the tourist zone of midtown Manhattan made headlines, but in other boroughs the toll of shootings and fatalities continued with no mayoral press conference: a 13-year-old boy was <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2012/08/24/13-year-old_fatally_shot_in_brookly.php\">fatally shot</a> Thursday night in Brooklyn, in the same neighborhood where a 15 year-old <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2012/08/17/15-yr-old_arrested_for_shooting_fou.php\">was arrested last week</a> for shooting four teens in a playground; and two men <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2012/08/24/food_vendor_shooting.php\">were shot on Thursday</a> over a \"food vendor turf war\" in the Bronx.</p> <p>These individual incidents, often in poorer urban neighborhoods, are generally overshadowed by more sensational mass shootings in city centers or suburbs. In absolute numbers, however, they are the real mass shootings \u2013 forming the vast majority of fatal gun violence cases.</p> <p>The finer points of the second amendment and the gun control debate are remote from these areas, and policing methods like \"stop-and-frisk\" have provided no lasting solution, so several communities have started organizing themselves to prevent gun violence in their neighborhoods. One such, a non-profit organization named Snug (\"guns\" spelled backwards), works to reduce gun violence in a 72-block section of central Harlem, in upper Manhattan. The area, which contains three housing project buildings and approximately 60 gangs, has long been a hotbed for violent crime. Snug mediates conflict among \"high-risk youth\", helps young people find employment, and when necessary, intervenes in violent situations.</p> <p>Most Snug employees are former gang members and ex-convicts who have reformed. Dedric \"Beloved\" Hammond, a Snug \"violence interrupter\" whose old street name was \"Bad News\", admits to having dealt drugs and carried a gun in his past. \"The thing that gave me a chance to change was [getting] locked up,\" he says. \"It started making me understand that what I thought was living wasn't living.\"</p> <p>Beloved and his team call themselves \"credible messengers\", since they can relate to the situations in which most Harlem teens find themselves. Being slightly older helps as well. \"I show them that you can get money, dress fresh, and everything, without doing nothing illegal,\" said Jamar Cooke, a Snug outreach worker.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3HmBMovEDZE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3HmBMovEDZE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Snug employees boast deep roots in Harlem, which breeds an immediate sense of familiarity and respect. \"My cousin knew [Beloved] from back in the day,\" said Antoine, a 24 year-old who grew up in the neighborhood. \"People really look up to him, so if he's telling people that gun violence ain't cool, then [eight out of ten kids] would be like, all right, I'm gonna leave guns alone.\"</p> <p>Antoine believes most youth who carry guns are \"na\u00efve\", while Cooke says they do it for respect, safety, and in some cases, peer pressure.&#xa0;\"You develop so much beef out here in the streets,\" Cooke said. \"Sometimes they feel safer with a gun.\"<br>&#xa0;<br>Cooke and other Snug employees believe much of the \"beef\" in Harlem \u2013 which they say can be about anything ranging from drugs to girls \u2013 can be dissipated by strengthening social ties, educating the community about the dangers of gun violence, and giving young people something productive to do with their free time. Snug hosts basketball and movie nights, and even helps youth with job searches.</p> <p>Operation Snug, which began in late 2010, is modeled after the successful <a href=\"http://ceasefirechicago.org/\">CeaseFire</a> program in Chicago. That model addresses violence as a public health issue that can be prevented using disease control methods \u2013 identifying the problem, intervening to stop its spread, and changing the norms and behavior to keep it from coming back. Similar initiatives exist in cities like <a href=\"http://www.nij.gov/topics/crime/gun-violence/prevention/ceasefire.htm\">Boston</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nationalgangcenter.gov/SPT/Programs/141\">Los Angeles</a>.</p> <p>\"Violence is a disease,\" says Rhea Morris, deputy director of nursing in the emergency department at <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/hhc/harlem/html/home/home.shtml\">Harlem Hospital Center</a>. \"It's not only a clinical disease, it's a social disease.\" Morris spoke of the particular problem of retaliation associated with gun violence. Snug's effort to interrupt potential retaliation is a critical part of what the hospital calls the \"Circle of Safety\", a coalition of organizations working together to reduce injuries and eliminate gunplay in the community. </p> <p>\"You know,\" says Maribel Ortiz, one of Snug's two female outreach workers, \"they say you did your job when you save one. But not me. Nah, I wanna save them all.\"</p> <p>Saving a life will never make sensational live TV news, but community initiatives like Snug may be the more important story.</p>",
  "<p>A US survey published by Pew Internet last month asked the question: <a href=\"http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/Future-of-Higher-Education/Overview/Introduction-and-overview-of-responses.aspx\" title=\"\">what will higher education look like in 2020</a>? We took on that very question last November in one of our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2012/jan/12/guardian-higher-education-live-chats\" title=\"\">live chats</a>, and now share the main points made by our panelists.</p> <p>On the panel were:</p> <p>Ewart Woolridge CBE, chief executive, <a href=\"http://www.lfhe.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Leadership Foundation for Higher Education</a></p> <p>Lance Fortnow, professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, <a href=\"http://eecs.northwestern.edu\" title=\"\">Northwestern University</a></p> <p>Martin Hughes, writer, <a href=\"http://theuniversityblog.co.uk/\" title=\"\">The University Blog</a></p> <p>Sean Ruston, chair, <a href=\"http://www.aldwychgroup.org/\" title=\"\">The Aldwych Group</a></p> <p>Liz Shutt. head of Policy, <a href=\"http://www.university-alliance.ac.uk\" title=\"\">University Alliance</a></p> <p>Vangelis Tsiligiris, college principal and researcher in cross-border higher education, <a href=\"http://mbscollege.academia.edu/VangelisTsiligiris/About\" title=\"\">MBS College</a></p> <p>Tamson Pietsch, lecturer in imperial history, <a href=\"http://www.brunel.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Brunel University</a></p> <p>Johnny Rich, founder, <a href=\"http://www.push.co.uk\" title=\"\">Push</a>, an independent guide to UK universities</p> <p>Joyce Canaan, professor of sociology, <a href=\"http://www.bcu.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Birmingham City University</a></p> <p>The 'best bits' are grouped around the five key themes covered in the live chat, with a sixth section on trends added to highlight some of the main ideas that came out of the discussion.

Click <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2011/nov/09/university-of-the-futureto\" title=\"\">here</a> to read the full live chat thread.</p> <h2><strong>Funding and finance</strong></h2> <p>MH: <strong>Students will become reliant on alternative sources for funding:</strong> Should the government withdraw funding further, or if they altered their stance on no student paying upfront and graduates only repaying once earnings go above \u00a321,000, expect not only a change in student numbers and diversity, but also an increased reliance on alternative sources. The system may not work if those sources are not available.</p> <p>SR: <strong>Employers will have to start playing a bigger funding role:</strong> We constantly hear businesses complain about graduates without the right skills sets; its time business put its money where its mouth is.</p> <p>LF: <strong>If we need to rely on industry funding for course we may lose even more control of our curriculum</strong>: In computer science, we already struggle with whether to teach courses that employers want so they can get jobs (and what Google wants is different from what Microsoft wants) or teaching them the fundamentals that will help them in the longer run. This tussle will only become more pronounced in the future.</p> <p>JR: <strong>Tax private companies, rather than students, and use that to fund universities:</strong> Hypothecate the money back to the university where the graduate studied and do away with fees. That'll encourage HEIs to run courses the labour market needs and students to do them.</p> <p>VT: <strong>HE will be shaped by the pursuit of monetary objectives, like those being promoted by the EU right now:</strong> Funding priorities will be low inflation, balanced budgets, reduction in the expenditure for 'public goods'. As we move towards an aggressive market based model in HE competition will change quality as we know it. Quality will be closer to 'value for money' and accountability.</p> <h2><strong>Distinctiveness and specialisation</strong></h2> <p>EW: <strong>Distinctiveness may become not just about what universities do but how they do it:</strong> We at the the Leadership Foundation have just finished a study of the 15 Cathedrals Group (faith-based) universities in the UK which demonstrated the importance of values in terms of the quality of the student experience, the relationship with staff and how they engage with their communities. As universities compete, establishing and communicating these values will become more important.</p> <p>MH: <strong>Some institutions may be forced to concentrate and specialise in order to effectively distinguish themselves and compete:</strong> Alternative institutions and open educational spaces provide a different view to traditional centres of learning. They may not be seen as HEIs in an official sense (yet), and may not provide formally recognised qualifications (again, yet), but it's important to see the value in people's desire to learn and form communities of research and engagement.</p> <p>JC: <strong>Must a university distinguish itself from its competition?</strong> It is a question that presumes commodification and marketisation. We should be focusing less on how distinctive a university is, what its 'USPs' [unique selling points] are, and more on what the purpose of a university is. Why should we accept that universities should be reconfigured, as they have been over the past 40 years?</p> <p>SR: <strong>Specialisation could create a two-tier system:</strong> We may see research money increasing concentrated at the Russell Group and 1994 Group, and the others forced to concentrate on teaching. This will result in a two-tier system, one that has ramifications for widening access. How long before employers become attuned to the different 'types' of university and start discriminating one or the other? Inevitably this will be a disaster for social mobility.</p> <p>TP: <strong>Universities will grapple with how to retain their credentialing role:</strong> HEIs have always, are and will continue to be, institutions that both foster knowledge and sanction forms of knowledge. But the internet has created not only a new form of knowledge, but a radical new form of access to it. The big question is: \"How will universities sanction the knowledged gained online\"?</p> <h2><strong>Student experience and widening participation</strong></h2> <p>MH: <strong>Participation shouldn't be a numbers game:</strong> One of the most important issues for the future is understanding that widening participation shouldn't be about getting a certain percentage into higher education. Widening participation should be about giving every person the right opportunities to higher learning should it be relevant and helpful to them.</p> <p>LF: <strong>There will be more virtual participation:</strong> Anyone with an Internet connection can get an incredible education essentially for free, from the point of view of accessing lectures and supplementary material. Oddly enough, this will make it harder for everyone to get a true university experience which includes a social environment and working directly with faculty and fellow students. Though it is possible social networking will also make this achievable.</p> <p>JR: <strong>Universities must engage with schools:</strong> Independent, personal contact with advisors and with information sources is critical if you want people, who have come from backgrounds with limited experience of it, to aspire to university. Even people handing out cubes of cheese in supermarkets understand that if you want somebody to invest in something you've got to give them a taste of it. Universities have a role in this.</p> <p>JC: <strong>Work within existing programmes but think outside the box:</strong> My colleague Matt Badcock and I are doing this in our <a href=\"http://insight.glos.ac.uk/tli/activities/ntf/creativehops/examples/Documents/Brief%20Matt%20%20Badcock%20Joyce%20Canaan.doc\" title=\"\">public sociology routeway</a>, taught in a dialogue-based beanbag space, and in which students are encouraged to work with progressive organisations outside. Other universities are also following these principles: Lincoln University have a concept called '<a href=\"http://studentasproducer.lincoln.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">student as producer</a>' that informs all programmes, encouraging students to be engaged in research from the beginning of their degrees.</p> <h2><strong>Leadership</strong></h2> <p>EW: <strong>What HE needs from future HE leaders:</strong></p> <p>\u2022 The right kind of values-based entrepreneurs</p> <p>\u2022 Leaders who can work inclusively to develop the narrative that works for their university</p> <p>\u2022 Leaders able to inspire trust and confidence in a tough world</p> <p>\u2022 Leaders who can challenge staff to change their ways as well as support them through change</p> <p>\u2022 Wisdom to make sense of such a fast moving environment and communicate that to others</p> <p>\u2022 And above all, they need to be good at forging the right partnerships with other organisations.</p> <p>LF: <strong>Visionary leadership over management:</strong> There is a joke made by an earlier president at Northwestern that his job was to provide \"football for the alumni, sex for the undergrads and parking for the faculty\". Back then presidents could get by just by managing a university. But today and certainly in the future, a university leader has to make difficult choices and choose specific areas that their school can excel in. It takes a strong leader to sell such a vision to the faculty and students.</p> <p>TP: <strong>To maintain a sector true to its purpose, set up an alternate league table:</strong> It would factor in criteria such as the percentage of senior management that have been professors, percentage of students who are members of societies or staff-student ratio. It would require adopting a ranking logic but its also a satire and a rejection of it.</p> <h2><strong>Internationalisation</strong></h2> <p>LF:<strong> International competition will matter more to US universities:</strong> If we can't keep US universities affordable, students will start attending schools overseas. The UK and Europe have always had great universities but now we are seeing strength build up around the world as the foreign PhD students, trained at US institutions, have headed home.</p> <p>VT: <strong>Internationalisation will need to be kept in check:</strong> Global higher education is becoming more driven by market dynamics rather than academic incentives. Universities need to review why they engage with the wider world before they lose their way. A great <a href=\"http://journals.sfu.ca/liu/index.php/HLRC/article/download/41/37\" title=\"\">overview about internationalisation</a> which captures most of the contemporary issues is by Drummond Bone.</p> <h2><strong>Trends:</strong></h2> <p>MH: <strong>Higher learning won't have to change itself:</strong> The topics covered and the technologies might change, but there will remain a large amount of consistency in concepts of learning, research, and discovery. Ideas will get fine-tuned and tested, but the concepts will still be recognisable.</p> <p>VT: <strong>Research may become 'the luxury of the few':</strong> If governments continue to move away from an 'HE as public good' approach, the sector will continue to become more marketised and less research focused. Most HEIs will also embrace more business orientated approaches to generate funds for programme delivery.</p> <p>JR: <strong>Who will be the arbiter of quality?</strong> Diversity can also mean diversity of quality. Who will be there to check standards are high enough? Particularly in institutions forced to find funding by occupying parts of a diverse market that have less to spend. The shift towards diversity must be accompanied by a shift towards accountability and promotion of understanding of what universities are offering.</p> <p>JC: <strong>Some universities will challenge the assumptions that mandate change:</strong> 1. universities all aspire to be like Oxford and Cambridge. 2. League tables are inevitable. 3. University diversity is a good thing because those from diverse parts of the sector can collaborate.</p> <p>EW: We will see a huge increase in diversity of universities, and probably an ever growing demand for higher education across the world - both for teaching and research.</p> <p>TP: One of the tasks for universities in the future will be to proudly speak out for and in the language of messiness, humanness, and quite frankly inefficiency.</p> <h2><strong>Resources:</strong></h2> <p>Hussey, T. &amp; Smith, P.

  "<p>Local authorities will not only have&#xa0;responsibility&#xa0;for the social fund from April 2013 (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/21/councils-invest-food-banks-welfare-cuts?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Breadline Britain: councils fund food banks to plug holes in welfare state</a>, 22 August) \u2013 they will also,&#xa0;thanks to the local government finance bill,&#xa0;have to implement&#xa0;a local&#xa0;council tax benefit which is to apply to people the council considers to be&#xa0;in financial need. There is nothing in the bill to prevent councils deciding to give vouchers for local food banks to meet&#xa0;financial&#xa0;need. They are already issued by jobcentres, Citizens Advice bureaux and some charities. Food banks can provide a little low-level nutrition in a crisis for three days, but were never designed to cope with months of malnutrition due to an inadequate level of incomes or benefits. &#xa0;</p> <p>No guidance about financial need will be issued by the Department for Communities and Local Government, whose ministers, along with every member of the cabinet, have abdicated the primary moral duty&#xa0;of a civilised government for ensuring their poorest fellow citizens have enough income to buy a healthy diet. This moral lacuna damages the economy: it creates massive costs for the health service and lost time at work. Nutritionists frequently remind us that Britain was better fed from 1940 to 1945, a time of war and far greater economic crisis than the present.<br><strong>Rev Paul Nicolson</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Taxpayers-Against-Poverty/299911526728884\" title=\"\"><em>Taxpayers Against Poverty</em></a></p> <p>\u2022 Your report is a stark illustration of the reality of food poverty in Britain. Unfortunately it is a reality that the government refuses to wake up to and accept responsibility for. In January when I questioned Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs minister Richard Benyon about food poverty, he claimed it was \"ridiculous to say that the rise in the need for food banks is attributable to this government\". However, in my constituency of Liverpool Wavertree the number of people accessing food banks has doubled in the last six months. More than 40% of people say their main reason for using the service is delay in receiving their benefits, often when their circumstances change.</p> <p>The increasing need for food banks is a damning indictment of this government's failed economic approach.<br><strong>Luciana Berger MP</strong><br><em>Labour, Liverpool Wavertree </em></p> <p>\u2022 News that councils are to fund food banks is an indictment of government policy and surely shames us all. Since 1945, the welfare state has protected us from falling below an essential threshold of decency due to age, infirmity or circumstances. Austerity is tearing holes in that safety net. Those paying the price include children, the unemployed, and people in low-paid work who earn too little to make ends meet. These conditions are distressing and humiliating for those who endure them.</p> <p>It is time to debate the introduction of a legal duty on government to ensure an adequate standard of living. Such a duty, to which the UK is already committed through international treaties, would not mean that individuals could pursue the state for housing or benefits unreasonably. It would commit the government to deploy resources towards providing a minimum threshold of food, clothing, shelter and social security. This includes generating sufficient revenue to fund essential services and regulating markets to serve social goals.</p> <p>The government has set up a commission to explore whether the UK should have a new bill of rights. If we are truly committed to our welfare state, why not enshrine that in law?<br><strong>Kate Green MP</strong><br><em>Labour, Stretford and Urmston</em></p> <p>\u2022 So poor people don't look after their health&#xa0;(<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/23/class-divide-health-widens-thinktank?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Class divide in health widens</a>, 23 August). It should come as no surprise that health interventions have the perverse effect of, at best, failing to reduce the gap between the worst and the best as more advantaged people heed the message. It's also well known that health inequities \u2013 inequalities is not the correct word \u2013 increased in the 90s alongside income inequality.&#xa0; The solution is not proselytizing for \"improved lifestyle\" but a massive reduction in the disparity in income, living conditions and opportunity in this country.<br><strong>Neil Blackshaw</strong><br><em>Little Easton, Essex</em></p>",
  "<p>As the diplomatic crisis over Julian Assange intensifies with mudslinging on both sides of the debate, Lisa Longstaff of Women Against Rape, which surprised many when it opposed the extradition of Assange this week, talks to playwright and author Bonnie Greer, who admits her exasperation with the WikiLeaks head. Oliver Laughland chairs.</p> <p><strong>Lisa Longstaff:</strong> We spend our lives trying to get men prosecuted for rape. We are driven by women who come to us who haven't got justice. The reaction we've gauged from people in our network is that Assange has been treated in a totally different way from every other accused rapist we've ever come across. It is very stark how Pinochet was treated in comparison to Assange. There was a similar request for extradition under [broader] accusations of mass torture, murder and rape, but he was given safety by Thatcher [see footnote]. We are aware of the context in which these particular accusations of sexual offences are being handled and we feel there are political motives behind the amount of resources that have been put into chasing down Assange. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/23/women-against-rape-julian-assange\" title=\"\">For us it's not a contradiction [to object to his extradition]. </a></p> <p><strong>Bonnie Greer:</strong> Your organisation fights for bringing people who commit sexual violence to book and I support you 1000% because we are still in an age \u2013 and this is disgusting especially with our brothers on the left \u2013 where men question whether women have been raped at all. Aside from anything to do with Assange, it's that these women are being questioned at all. I grew up in a neighbourhood where rape was common, I've had it in my family, I know men and women who've been raped. I've gone with people to police stations where the cops were looking at them and thinking: \"Right so you went home with him didn't you, that's not rape, is it?\". I'm surprised that men I respect have suggested these women set Assange up. What it did for me as a woman was throw this centuries-old chasm between us and them again.</p> <p><strong>LL:</strong> Awful comments about rape are not a thing confined to the left. We come across people who are dismissive of rape all the time. The ones who really upset us are the ones who work in the law, the government \u2013 like Todd Akin [the republican candidate for the US senate seat of Missouri who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/20/todd-akin-legitimate-rape-romney\" title=\"\">referred to \"legitimate rape\" earlier this week</a>]. We hear comments like George Galloway's all the time but I'm not going to defend people who are full of shit about rape, they are out of their box. Dinosaurs. But it doesn't alter my position that there are awful things going on in this case. I'm not in a&#xa0;position to know [if the allegations are true]. I haven't met [the accusers] \u2013 but I&#xa0;do know that people get set up for rape. There's a long history of it. I've seen rape used to undermine movements in many suspicious circumstances, it's an issue that gets thrown around. It's an issue that's close to people's hearts and it's so mishandled by the authorities. Assange should be questioned here. He hasn't even been charged yet.</p> <p><strong>BG:</strong> For me the law is the most important thing. Assange has exhausted every legal&#xa0;remedy that he has in this country, from top to bottom. People say there's something suspicious but I'm still looking for evidence.</p> <p><strong>LL:</strong> There is evidence. [Look at] the rendition of these two men, Ahmed Agisa and Mohamed Alziri [Egyptian asylum seekers who were deported from Sweden back to Egypt under the alleged influence of the US for terror allegations] back in 2001.</p> <p><strong>BG:</strong> I think he should go. Sweden exists under the rule of law, why would we just assume he's going to be hurt there?</p> <p><strong>LL:</strong> Because he's an enemy of the state of the most powerful government in the world, that's why.</p> <p><strong>BG:</strong> With the greatest of respect, I've read&#xa0;everybody who wants Assange to&#xa0;stay here, and every argument veers off into this \"it's alleged\" or \"apparently\". I'm the first person to stand up here and say the US is capable of anything and has done it too. But to hold up those two unfortunate men in comparison [is wrong]. The more Assange hangs out in that embassy and keeps this rolling on the more it becomes the Julian Assange roadshow. What we&#xa0;need to be focused on is WikiLeaks the organisation, and that young man [Bradley Manning] in the US who is going through hell. I want Assange to go back and clear this up, and then get back to work. This thing has become a&#xa0;circus; it's become gross and it's become overplayed.</p> <p><strong>LL:</strong> I don't see how you can extract Assange from that political pressure.</p> <p><strong>Oliver Laughland:</strong> Where do you think&#xa0;this supposed decline in popular support for Assange comes from?</p> <p><strong>LL:</strong> I think a lot of the circus and the media witch-hunt against Assange has been driven by journalists embedded with the US and British state. I think the media should take a step back. They should not just jump onto the issue without thinking about it. Our organisation is constantly trying to get the media to engage in supporting women's attempts to get justice, in tracking down rapists, in getting them imprisoned. But, they're not interested. What they are interested in is these salacious and sensationalist arguments. The most base instincts in people have been brought out.</p> <p><strong>BG:</strong> WikiLeaks has now become secondary to the saga that's swirling around. If it was my organsation for the sake of [Manning] and all the other people influenced by his work, I'd go [to Sweden] to take the light off me and let&#xa0;my organisation live. I'm still a upporter of WikiLeaks, but one of the things I was so excited about at the beginning was that kind of buccaneer, this incredibly smart guy, who went in the face of the biggest power on earth and just did a document dump of all the stuff we didn't know about. As a child of the 60s and the Vietnam war, I'm the first person to stand up and say: \"This is what we need.\" WikiLeaks and its work is bigger than the person.</p> <p><strong>LL:</strong> But the person is not dispensable. Assange did a great service to all of us to get that information out there, to really uncover some of the dirty secrets the US was hiding behind. It's such a double standard now. The debate has polarised. You think I'm just giving stock answers, but I think you're sitting on the fence.</p> <p><strong>BG:</strong> I don't think that the people who support Assange are wrong. I don't think it's about wrong or right. People feel very deeply about the situation now. I've yet to see people like Tariq Ali, who I have enormous respect for, give me an answer other than the stock one. I need more. We're at a turning point in history and if we don't get another answer \u2013 it's just not enough any more.</p> <p>\u2022 This footnote was appended on 27 August 2012.

  "<p><strong>Glencore</strong>'s attempted takeover of <strong>Xstrata </strong>slipped further away as a deadline passed for the commodities trader to raise its \u00a318bn offer, as demanded by Xstrata's second-biggest shareholder, Qatar Holdings.</p> <p>As the deadline neared, investor advisory service Pirc put out a letter to Xstrata shareholders advising them to vote against and criticising as \"inappropriate and wholly excessive\" the payments due to Xstrata bosses if the deal went ahead.</p> <p>A meeting is planned for 7 September for shareholders of both companies to vote on the takeover, which involves Glencore offering 2.8 new shares for every share in Xstrata. Qatar Holdings is demanding 3.25 new shares but a new bid must be submitted two weeks before any meeting.</p> <p>Pirc wrote: \"There is no evidence that Xstrata has undertaken appropriate due diligence on Glencore in order to protect Xstrata shareholders. In addition, the level of independent representation on the board is insufficient&#xa0;\u2026 shareholders are not provided with adequate assurance that the proposed transaction has been subject to an appropriate level of objective scrutiny.\"</p> <p>The deal is not quite dead \u2013 Glencore could change the meeting date \u2013 but it certainly makes things harder.</p> <p>Now comes a game of hardball with investors watching closely to see who will blink first, although the Qataris certainly have the time and money to call Glencore boss Ivan Glasenberg's bluff. Glencore shares were up 13p on the week at 366.9p, while Xstrata rose 20p at 927.7p.</p> <p>Elsewhere, one company that must have wished it had agreed to be taken over when it had the chance is infrastructure firm <strong>Mouchel</strong>, which collapsed into administration on Friday.</p> <p>Rivals Costain and Interserve offered \u00a3150m for the business last year, but were turned down by the board. The shares were suspended at less than 1p having traded at 120p two years ago.</p> <p>The group, which relied heavily on government contracts, will now be seized by its lenders after shareholders failed to back a last-ditch restructuring. It said all 8,000 jobs would be saved.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <strong>Lonmin</strong>, the platinum miner has continued its struggle to regain control after the 44 deaths during miners' strikes in South Africa.</p> <p>It said finance director Simon Scott would step into the breach as acting CEO, because current boss Ian Farmer remained seriously ill in hospital. One of Scott's first acts is likely to be announcing a rights issue to raise $700m -$1bn. The shares closed the week up 30p at 640p, way off the pre-violence high of 774.5p.</p> <p>Mining firms had a tough time this week, bouncing up and down on the back of poor private sector PMI figures, mixed with rumours of more quantitative easing to be announced next week by US Federal Bank chief Ben Bernanke.</p> <p>On Friday, the biggest fallers included some of Thursday's biggest risers: <strong>ENRC</strong>, down 12.6p at 338.9p; <strong>Evraz</strong>, down 7.8p at 246.8p; <strong>Kazakhmys</strong> down 20p at 660.5p and <strong>Anglo American </strong>down 56.5p at \u00a318.85.</p>",
  "<p>A match already abridged by some fine bowling and indifferent batting from both sides was denied the potentially thrilling finish it deserved here.</p> <p>Sussex were marginally the more miffed. But though they started the last day as clear favourites, needing another 133 for victory with all their wickets standing, that was not the case at the end, when they were 115 for five. Needing a further 49 for the win that would have maintained the momentum of their recent charge, they still fancied themselves to cross the line.</p> <p>But Somerset, too, had a sniff of victory after three strikes by Peter Trego, whose control is giving him a terrific season with the ball, and Abdur Rehman, who took two.</p> <p>It was more frustrating for the players than anyone else, since they both wanted to finish the match, one way or another, and get down to Cardiff for Saturday's t20 finals.</p> <p>\"It's been a rubbish day,\" Somerset's captain, Marcus Trescothick, said. \"We got ourselves back into the game after being out of it, and we did have our chances of winning it.\"</p> <p>Just 24.3 overs were possible. Even then, right at the end, we might have got the climax we had waited for. The umpires said play would begin at 5.10, with 14.3 overs to bowl.</p> <p>Sussex wanted a little more than three an over, while Somerset needed five wickets. But then the rain came again. Needless to say, the ground was bathed in sunshine as the players drove away.</p> <p>Play started an hour late and in the third over Ed Joyce, driving, was well caught behind by Jos Buttler, moving athletically to his left.</p> <p>Sussex promoted Luke Wright to first wicket down, and he hit Trego for 18 in an over, with three fours and a six over mid-on. But Chris Nash, driving, lost his off stump and the hopelessly out of form Murray Goodwin immediately top-edged his sweep to short fine leg.</p> <p>In the next over Wright was bowled and Sussex were wobbling at 72 for four. Michael Yardy and Luke Wells steadied things before lunch but then Yardy edged the first ball after the break low to slip. Sadly, that was about it.</p>",
  "<p>Humans used to have tails, but all that's left is a vestigial coccyx. American political conventions used to choose presidential candidates, but now they are televised coronations.</p> <p>The vestigial tail of the American political convention is the compilation and approval of the party's platform, a long document listing a rag-bag of policies that excite the party activists and is swiftly forgotten.</p> <p>Since platforms are not binding on party candidates, they are merely symbolic. They do however offer a window into a party's soul, a combination of wishlist, base stroking and vote-grabbing.</p> <p>For the Republican party, the 2012 platform debate isn't so much a vestigial tail as an appendix \u2013 not notes at the end of a book but a vermiform appendix, a dead-end tube. Like party platforms, the appendix's role is a mystery to most people: it may be a useful harbour for bacteria but can also rupture, causing pain and misery.</p> <p>For the Republicans compiling the party's 2012 platform, all was going well until the eruption caused by Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin's remarks about \"legitimate rape\" magically avoiding the need for abortions. That put the spotlight on the party's platform on abortion, which boldly commits the party to backing a constitutional amendment granting full rights to an unborn child, outlawing abortion in all circumstances.</p> <p>The Romney campaign's position is more mild. Mitt Romney favours banning abortion other than a few exceptions, such as threatening the mother's health and for pregnancies resulting from rape.</p> <p>But that is nothing new, despite denunciations of the Republican platform being the most right-wing in the party's history. Go back to the 2004 platform for the convention that renominated George Bush, and you'll find almost identical language:</p> <blockquote> <p>[T]he unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and we endorse legislation to make it clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children. Our purpose is to have legislative and judicial protection of that right against those who perform abortions.</p> </blockquote> <p>Compare that to the language being proposed for the Tampa convention next week:</p> <blockquote> <p>[W]e assert the sanctity of human life and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children.</p> </blockquote> <p>The difference this year is that the timing and profile of Akin's remarks drew attention to the implications of the platform clause. It moved senator Scott Brown, facing a tough battle in moderate Massachusetts, to complain to the RNC chairman: \"I believe this is a mistake because it fails to recognise the views of pro-choice Republicans like myself.\"</p> <p>The platform's language also includes a \"salute\" \u2013 tacit support and recognition \u2013 to states that impose additional restrictions on abortion, as well as backing the appointment of judges opposed to abortion.</p> <p>But there are several other provisions of the latest Republican platform being drafted that go beyond previous efforts.</p> <p>On immigration, despite a nod at a guest-worker programme, the GOP's stance is harsher than ever. Led by Kansas hardliner Kris Kobach, the platform is stuffed full of immigration fantasy: the construction of a giant wall along the US border with Mexico, mandatory use of electronic verification by private employers, no support for a path to citizenship, the blocking of funds to universities offering in-state tuition fees to the undocumented, and an end to federal lawsuits against controversial anti-immigrant legislation such as Arizona's SB1070 \u2013 a law in fact drafted by Kobach.</p> <p>And in a reminder of Mitt Romney's most bizarre immigration proposal during the primary season, the platform also backs \"self-deportation\" as a policy goal.</p> <p>The platform's role as a safe place to store bacteria can be seen in its likely adoption of a call to have annual audits of the Federal Reserve and the establishment of a \"gold commission,\" both sops to the Ron Paul \"goldbug\" faction within the party who harbour great hostility towards the Fed and dream of a return by the US dollar to the gold standard abandoned by Richard Nixon in 1972.</p> <p>On gay rights, there's a coded critique of the Obama administration's end of the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy barring homosexuals from serving openly in the US military, calling for an end to \"the use of military as a platform for social experimentation\". Traditional GOP demands for support for the Defense of Marriage Act are included as well.</p> <p>At the end of all the posturing there was at least one policy detail that may be significant. That was the dropping of language supporting the tax deduction for home mortgage interest. The move was supported by the Romney campaign \u2013 which is keeping a close eye on the platform for danger signs \u2013 and so suggests that Romney himself may back abolishing the tax break.</p>",
  "<p>At first, the news that a&#xa0;seemingly happy and successful <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/20/tony-scott-director-dies\" title=\"\">film director had jumped off a bridge and killed himself</a> seemed utterly shocking and inexplicable. But it didn't take many hours for the world's media to start reporting a perfectly credible reason for&#xa0;Tony Scott's self-annihilation in Los&#xa0;Angeles this week. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/20/tony-scott-days-of-thunder\" title=\"\">He had been suffering from an inoperable brain tumour</a>. He was going to die anyway, after great and protracted suffering. Suddenly, it all made sense. The only snag is that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/20/tony-scott-death-stuns-hollywood-tributes?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Scott's grieving wife, Donna, says that the inoperable brain tumour story isn't true</a>.</p> <p>Which is inconvenient, really, because the world loves heroic suicides, particularly as there are so few. In truth, sad and tragic as suicide is generally viewed as being, it is also considered the ultimate expression of screwed-up, narcissistic self-pity, the final mistake in a life that was probably heaving with mistakes, an admission of perceived failure, or of genuine guilt. Mostly, suicide leaves confusion, frustration, bitterness and even fury in its wake. Even the most tragic suicides of all, the&#xa0;very young, are invariably thought to have been influenced in their hopelessness by a lack of maturity and an incomplete understanding of the fact that nothing exists, nothing at all, except existence.</p> <p>Unsuccessful suicides are considered to be \"cries for help\", while successful ones are seen as the most terrible and irrevocable symptoms of mental illness, of a balance of mind that was disturbed. Suicides are often posthumously accused, somewhat self-righteously, of&#xa0;being \"selfish\". To be a heroic suicide, a brave one that was not misguided, avoidable, even cowardly, you must have a very good reason for it. An inoperable brain tumour is one such reason. It ticks all the boxes. If humans dread one thing more than death, it is&#xa0;death after suffering, indignity, dependence, confusion and pain. Or so&#xa0;we tell ourselves.</p> <p>Many of us would like to think that&#xa0;we could concoct and carry out a&#xa0;life-ending plan were we confronted with imminent, undignified death, or worse, imminent, undignified severe limitation of the quality of our lives until we died. But not that many people&#xa0;actually do it.&#xa0;In Oregon, where&#xa0;it&#xa0;is legal (though difficult) to be prescribed life-ending drugs in certain circumstances, takeup is low (<a href=\"http://public.health.oregon.gov/ProviderPartnerResources/EvaluationResearch/DeathwithDignityAct/Pages/index.aspx\" title=\"\">since the law was passed in 1997, 596 patients have died from taking medication prescribed under the act</a>). Likewise, the number of people visiting the Dignitas clinic with the intention of&#xa0;ending their lives is very small considering the amount of publicity the&#xa0;service attracts. On the other hand, the number of humans, now and throughout history, who cling to their lives, however harsh, miserable and challenging those lives may be, is pretty high.</p> <p>Media reporting of individual suicide is undertaken, or is supposed to be undertaken within strict guidelines, and for a very good reason. Suicide is acknowledged to be psychologically contagious, and the careless publicising of means of suicide can lead to infection of the vulnerable. That is why clusters of suicides can occur. And some people are more suggestible than others. Ask any hypnotist, and they will confirm this. Even some physically healthy people are very much more vulnerable than others to the idea that perhaps they ought to think about ending their life.</p> <p>That fact, of variable vulnerability to&#xa0;suggestion, I think, is what is too often lost in the debate over what is euphemistically called \"assisted suicide\". The right-to-die campaigner Tony Nicklinson had suffered for years from locked-in syndrome. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/22/tony-nicklinson-right-to-die-case?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">He died of natural causes on Wednesday, six days after his high court bid for a third party to end his life on his behalf had failed</a>. One is tempted to wonder if the fight for death had been all that was keeping him going. But there can be little doubt that Nicklinson knew his own mind. He probably never, even in his youth, had been the sort who was likely to wake up in an auditorium, on a stage, standing next to The Great Hypnoto and wondering why 2,000 people were laughing uproariously.</p> <p>Many feel passionately that it is an abomination to deny people the right to assisted suicide, especially those who are unable, physically, to carry out a&#xa0;suicide themselves. I admire their certainty, just as I'd admire the certainty of a person who ended his own life rationally, cleanly and efficiently when faced with an unbearable future. But I&#xa0;cannot help feeling that such empathy is for people who are similar to them \u2013 certain, single-minded, not open to suggestibility, convinced of their own&#xa0;rationality.</p> <p>The legal maxim \"hard cases make bad law\" is wise. For every person who can make a cool assessment of the quality of life that awaits them, apply enlightenment thinking, and decide they'd be better off dead, there are surely quite a few who struggle to decide what colour they should paint their front door. It is horrible, the idea that these people \u2013 as well as those who are blessed, even in great misfortune, with certainty \u2013 should have to wrestle, along with a frightening diagnosis, with the thought that perhaps they should just embrace the inevitable right away and \"not be a burden\". I'm not saying that an assisted suicide law should not be contemplated, just that it would have to be a lot more highly circumscribed and a lot less <em>pertinent</em> than many of its enthusiasts imagine.</p> <p>It is little wonder that groups representing the interests of people with disabilities should be so deeply unenthusiastic about the concept of assisted suicide.</p> <p>From the point of view of those who fear that they might be the ones on the receiving end of the notion that it is brave and romantic to end an impeded life, or a life that is dependent on the ministrations of others, assisted suicide must surely look more like a terrible pressure than an attractive option. Lord knows, there are people enough already who think \"the disabled\" are legitimate targets of contempt or scorn. Why would one wish to encourage such monsters to decide a suffering person has only himself or herself to blame for continuing a life that they themselves wouldn't fancy?</p> <p>There is a basic problem with assisted suicide. Enshrining self-sacrifice in law, as an option available to rational, <em>admirable</em> people, risks making life yet more uncomfortable for those many among us who would rather not feel guilty about preferring to cling to life, however difficult, uncomfortable and frightening it may become, for every second that they possibly can. And why&#xa0;shouldn't they? That's rational too,&#xa0;is it not \u2013 the view that life, whatever its quality, is preferable to an&#xa0;eternity of nothing?</p>",
  "<p>The pretend debate rages on. Is it \"right\" to publish <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/24/1?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">photographs of law-abiding people when they are naked in their own hotel rooms</a>, without their permission? Is it right to take such pictures, then sell them to someone who will place them in&#xa0;the public domain if there is someone who is willing to buy? Gosh, ethics are so&#xa0;<em>hard</em>.</p> <p>Ethics aren't that hard at all though, are they? Some nasty and exploitative person took advantage of an individual's vulnerability, a vulnerability that exists because he has an unsought role in public life, then distributed them to other nasty and exploitative people. Eventually, the Sun \u2013 and others \u2013 started claiming that since so many other people were being nasty and exploitative, then it had a \"duty\" to join in, so its readers could join in too.</p> <p>I can't help wishing that we lived in a&#xa0;world where it was obvious that the initial betrayal of trust was ghastly \u2013 however misplaced that trust might have been \u2013 and that anyone who colluded in any way with the betrayal is contemptible.</p> <p>It seems obvious to me that if people really are going to be given \"important\" roles simply through an accident of birth, then they are not necessarily going to turn out to be exactly the sort of perfect paragon, an empty vessel waiting to be filled, that the \"position\" of third in line to the throne demands.</p> <p>There is a complex debate to be had about whether it is ethical, in a supposed meritocracy, to assign high-profile duties by reason of birth, then huff and puff about \"the public interest\". But since there isn't much appetite for that debate, then there isn't much else to discuss.</p> <p>Take the royal family, or leave them. But don't declare your support for the&#xa0;monarchy, as the Sun does, then clutch at your pearls when members of&#xa0;that elite group turn out to like partying in Vegas.</p>",
  "<p>A laid-off clothing designer killed his former manager before being shot dead by police in New York on Friday after a workplace dispute escalated into a shootout near the Empire State Building.</p> <p>At least nine people were wounded during the attack, in one of the most crowded areas of Manhattan. Some of those injured may have been shot by police as they shot at the gunman, who pointed his handgun at them but is understood not to have fired.</p> <p>The shooting led to panic in the tourist-heavy streets around the Empire State Building, with fears that another mass shooting was under way. However, it became clear that it was not a random attack when police revealed that the victim had been targeted.</p> <p>Police named the suspect as Jeffrey Johnson, a 58-year-old who had been employed for six years as a designer of women's accessories at Hazan Imports, a business that operates from premises in midtown near the Empire State Building.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Nzafn0n6Po8\">New York police commissioner Raymond Kelly said during a press conference </a>that he was laid off as part of a downsizing at the firm. Kelly described the gunman as a \"disgruntled former employee\" who came back to confront his former manager. \"He shot and killed the former co-worker, striking him three times,\" Kelly said.</p> <p>After shooting his manager, named by city officials as 41-year-old Steven Ercolino, the gunman began walking towards the Empire State Building. He was trailed by a construction worker who managed to alert two police officers on patrol at the building.</p> <p>Johnson moved to draw his weapon, a .45 caliber handgun, as the officers approached. There are conflicting reports as to what happened next. \"The [police] tape clearly shows that the gunman had the gun out, and was trying to kill the officers,\" New York city mayor Michael Bloomberg said. However, other officials at the scene reportedly said the man had not fired on police.</p> <p>The two police officers discharged 14 rounds, killing Johnson outside the entrance to the Empire State Building. At least nine other people were injured in the shooting \u2013 four women and five men. All were taken to city hospitals with gunshot wounds, but none is believed to be in a life-threatening condition.</p> <p>Erica Solar, a mother of two who works as a receptionist on 37th St, was among those shot. Solar was on her way to Dunkin' Donuts when she was hit in the back of the leg. Her friend Christopher Collins found Solar lying on the street as he got off a bus on his way to work.</p> <p>\"She was basically in shock. She didn't know if she had gotten stabbed or if she had gotten shot, but she just knew she was bleeding, and I was just there trying to keep her calm until paramedics arrived,\" Collins said.</p> <p>\"It was chaotic. Everybody was running, cops were there immediately,\" Collins said. Solar was taken to Bellevue hospital, about a mile from the Empire State Building.</p> <p>Solar's brother, Louis Lleras, said that \"at first she didn't realize she was shot\".</p> <p>\"She heard the shots ring, she started running across the street \u2026 then she noticed that she was shot, so she just fell down,\" Lleras said.</p> <p>Media Rosario, 43, from Brooklyn, was shot in the back of her leg on her way to work at 34th St and Fifth Ave. She was also taken to Bellevue. \"She said that everything happened so fast, she saw people running, and when she turned around to see what happened, she was already shot,\" said her sister-in-law, Auselis Rosario.</p> <p>The shooting took place at about 9am as the Manhattan streets were filled with rush-hour traffic, employees going to work and tourists. Kay Hudson, who works on 33rd St, said she was \"three feet\" from one of those shot, but survived unharmed. She told the Guardian she heard the noise of a gun and saw a man fall to the ground.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F57410489&amp;show_artwork=true\"> <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F57410489&show_artwork=true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p></p> <p>\"I heard a noise, like seven pops go off,\" Hudson said. \"When I turned around, I saw the man fall and he had a helmet in his hand. I just ran, and I told everyone to run.\"</p> <p>Some people at the scene appeared to be tourists, Hudson said, and did not understand her shouts. \"I just started to run, and by the time I got to the side street, I looked back to make sure that it was shots that I heard. I looked back and I saw the man lying on the ground.\"</p> <p>\"He definitely was not moving. His hands were spread out,\" she said.</p> <p>Hudson sprinted east along 33rd St towards her office, where television news reports confirmed what she had just seen. \"I can't even process,\" she said. \"I had to walk back to be sure that I saw what I was seeing,\" she said.</p> <p>Adrianne Lapar, 27, who works in the Empire State Building, said: \"People started running, saying someone had a gun, so I just ran the other way. I was scared.\"</p> <p>Dahlia Anister, 33, who works at an office nearby, said: \"I heard the gunshots. It was like pop, pop, pop. It was definitely in a bunch.\"</p> <p>Police shut down nearby streets as forensic teams checked the gunman's body. The FBI were quick to confirm that the attack was not an act of terrorism.</p> <p>New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg \u2013 a vocal critic of America's lax firearm controls \u2013 said: \"Once again, there are an awful lot of guns out there.\" He added that although homicides in New York were on the decline, \"we are not immune to the problem of gun violence\".</p> <p>Kelly said the incident was not related to the Empire State Building itself. In 1997, a gunman opened fire on the 86th floor observation deck, killing one tourist and wounding six others.</p> <p>City officials were quick to praise the response by police and the construction worker who followed Johnson from the site of the initial shooting.</p> <p>Bloomberg said: \"We all use the word 'hero' \u2013 he did what he should have done.\" The mayor added: \"He saw something, he said something\" \u2013 the phrase has become the backbone of efforts to get New York residents to be vigilant ever since the September 11 attacks. The actions of both the worker and police officers may have prevented further injuries, Bloomberg and Kelly said.</p> <p>The incident puts gun crime in America back in the spotlight. As with other high-profile summer shootings in the US \u2013 at a movie theatre in Colorado on July 20 and at a Sikh Temple in Wisconsin earlier this month \u2013 it is thought unlikely that Barack Obama or Mitt Romney will address the issue in an election year.</p>",
  "<p><strong>(updated below [Sat.])</strong></p> <p>In January, Bill Clinton turned on MSNBC for what seems to have been the first time in awhile and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/18/bill-clinton-msnbc-fox_n_1214143.html\">shared his reaction</a> to what he saw in an interview with Esquire:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I was just watching MSNBC, and they had a woman that used to work for me and a couple of other people on there, and they were talking about the Republican primary. And I was laughing. I said, 'Boy, it really has become our version of Fox.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>For several reasons, it is hyperbole to posit a complete equivalence between the two cable outlets. For one, MSNBC still provides <a href=\"http://upwithchrishayes.msnbc.com/\">some independent and intellectually honest journalism</a>. For another, at least until this election year, even its <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/24/maddow-on-gay-marriage-new-york-obama_n_884444.html\">most prominent hosts</a> sometimes voiced <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBdPEK5pNtE\">harsh criticism</a> of Obama of the type that Fox never allowed toward Bush. Beyond that, MSNBC devotes three hours each morning to a show hosted by a former rightwing GOP congressman and his cavalcade of vapid \"centrist\" establishment journalists such as Mark Halperin (then again, Fox features the idiosyncratic and unpredictable Shepard Smith each night). And MSNBC still has quite a ways to go before it matches Fox's demonstrated willingness to spew outright falsehoods in pursuit of its partisan agenda.</p> <p>All that acknowledged, there is more than a small amount of truth to Clinton's comparison. Like Fox in its Bush-cheering heyday, the vast bulk of MSNBC's programming is devoted to one core message: American politics is understood as a Manichean battle between Good and Evil; the Republicans are the Evil, and the Obama-led Democrats are the Good. One is very hard-pressed outside of the few exceptions I noted to find any deviation from this painfully simplistic, partisan apparatchik script. It's a virtually non-stop outlet for DNC talking points. Like rightwing viewers of Fox, loyal Obama supporters and Democrats know one thing for certain: when they tune into MSNBC for most hours of the day, they will have their political beliefs flattered and will be made to feel good and noble about their partisan allegiance.</p> <p>All of that is fine and largely unobjectionable: given Fox's existence, there's no reason Democrats shouldn't have their own television gathering place, for the sake of balance if nothing else. But the problem is that MSNBC is now aggressively importing many of the worst tactics that make Fox such a repellent and destructive blight on our political landscape. And as their palpable desperation to push Obama over the finish line intensifies, so does their willingness to wield these tactics without limits or shame.</p> <p>Thursday provided one of the most pernicious examples yet. Afternoon host Martin Bashir <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/msnbcs-martin-bashir-shouts-down-then-boots-republican-guest/\">was interviewing</a> a GOP strategist, Trey Hardin (the video is embedded below). The subject of this interview was a newly formed group of military veterans who are harshly criticizing the Obama administration for its <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/06/07/probing_obamas_secrecy_games/\">serial leaking of classified information about military operations</a> when doing so politically benefits Obama. </p> <p>To begin the interview, Bashir showed video of Joint Chiefs Chairman General Martin Dempsey as he <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/joint-chiefs-chairman-gen-martin-dempsey-scolds-veterans-anti-obama-documentary-article-1.1141768\">criticized this veterans' group</a> on the ground that members of the military should remain apolitical. Gen Dempsey's complaint was odd since the obligation to be apolitical generally rests with active-duty service members, not former ones (as the group's founder correctly said in replying to the general: \"He's active duty; we are not. We're now citizens and we have a first amendment right to be able to speak out\").</p> <p>When the video ended, Bashir asked Hardin for his reaction to Gen Dempsey's criticisms of the veterans group, and Hardin began replying with this very mild statement about Dempsey: \"First of all, he serves President Obama right now, so it's not a surprising comment.\" Bashir immediately erupted in a ball of fiery rage, cutting Hardin off, refusing to let him speak, repeatedly demanding an apology for this grievous assault on the integrity of a military man, and then \u2013 when Hardin failed sufficiently to grovel for the crime of speaking ill of Gen Dempsey \u2013 Bashir kicked Hardin off the show by abruptly ending the interview.</p> <p>Apparently on MSNBC now, at least on this show, it is verboten to speak critically of a military official (at least one who is defending President Obama). Just think about the fact that the person enforcing this no-criticism-of-military-officials rule considers himself, and is held out to be, a \"journalist\". You could practically hear Bashir crisply and obediently saluting as he accused Hardin of the crime of disrespect to a general; here is just some of what he shouted, literally, each time Hardin tried to move on: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"I'm sorry, I cannot allow you to cast such a contemptuous aspersion against a senior military officer by demeaning his service to this country. Will you please take that comment back? \u2026 Sir, he serves the United States of America.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>\"A contemptuous aspersion against a senior military officer\"! \"Demeaning his service to this country.\" These are the prohibited thought crimes as decreed by a \"journalist\" on a progressive cable network. All that because Hardin had the temerity merely to point out that as a direct subordinate of Obama's who works with him on a daily basis, Dempsey has an interest in defending him from political attacks \u2013 that he's not some unimpeachable Oracle of Truth before whose very pronouncements we must all bow. Not even the Spanish Inquisition entailed such delicate, hair-trigger recriminations for blasphemy as the one that set off this MSNBC host yesterday on his little patriotism enforcement crusade.</p> <p>This steadfast devotion to the political glorification of the Democratic party leader, at the expense of any pretense of journalism, has been evident at MSNBC for quite some time. Most remarkably: last July, <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/07/27/sharpton_10/\">60 Minutes reported</a> that Al Sharpton \"has decided<em> not to criticize the president about anything</em>\" \u2013 a vow that should be the ultimate disqualifying attribute for working in journalism: how can someone be employed as a political commentator if they vow never to criticize the president under any circumstances? But shortly thereafter, Sharpton was hired by MSNBC to host a prime-time show, replacing a host, Cenk Uygur, who had <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/21/cenk-uygur-msnbc-leaving_n_905415.html\">frequently criticized Obama</a> from the left. Apparently, at MSNBC, a vow never to criticize the nation's most powerful political official is not disqualifying to be hired as a journalist; to the contrary, it's a resume asset.</p> <p>In February, Obama deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/02/24/e/\">went on MSNBC</a> and mocked Mitt Romney for stating that before deciding whether he had the legal authority to launch an attack on Iran, he would consult with administration lawyers on that question. To smiling MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell, Cutter remarked: \"that does not make a commander-in-chief, somebody who has to check with his lawyers.\" So it's no longer Karl Rove, Sarah Palin and the RNC that are the featured venues for mocking the notion that a president should comply with the law before using military force: this is now standard fare at MSNBC, courtesy of Obama campaign aides who, when they appear there, are treated more politely than the British Queen on a state visit to Canada.</p> <p>As is true for Obama policies themselves \u2013 from due-process-free assassinations to compulsive secrecy to indefinite detention and beyond \u2013 the adoption of these tactics by MSNBC converts them from from rightwing afflictions into standard, uncontroversial orthodoxy. It's not just on Fox News, but now also on MSNBC, where speaking critically of a military official, even in the mildest of tones, is treated like it's some sort of grave crime against the state: one that results in sanctimonious outbursts, manipulative appeals to patriotism, and the casting of the offender out of decent company. That this demand for reverence of military officials comes someone holding themselves out as a journalist \u2013 on a progressive network no less (<a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39507182/ns/business-us_business/t/msnbc-lean-forward-two-year-brand-campaign/\">Lean Forward!</a>) \u2013 makes it all the more disturbing.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/player/?con?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe src=\"https://videos.mediaite.com/embed/player/?content=5PD5T130GQGZV914&content_type=content_item&layout=&playlist_cid=&media_type=video&widget_type_cid=svp&read_more=1\" width=\"460\" height=\"461\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>   <p>* * * * * </p> <p><strong><em>UPDATE [Sat.]</em></strong>: On Thursday, Fox News reported the actual name of the former Navy SEAL who is about to publish a book providing what purports to be a first-hand account of the bin Laden raid, a book I wrote <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/23/bin-laden-raid-exposes-obama-administration-selective-secrecy\">about on Thursday</a>. This reporting by Fox sent MSNBC prime-time host Ed Schultz into a <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/msnbcs-ed-schultz-slams-fox-news-for-publicizing-name-of-seal-team-6-member/\">patriotism-driven outburst of rage</a> last night quite similar to the one Bashir spat up. Schultz proudly announced that, unlike Fox, MSNBC would conceal the identity of the book's author to protect him from being attacked by Islamic Terrorists. Citing Fox's perfectly reasonable statement that \"once you write a book, anonymously or not, you have no reasonable expectation of privacy,\" Schultz branded Fox's justification as \"the most un-American response I think that you can ever get.\"</p> <p>MSNBC now seems to be the media leader in demanding reverence and secrecy around all things military, and denouncing anyone who deviates as America-hating, military-loathing traitors. Perhaps they can proudly tout that distinction in their next \"Lean Forward\" commercials.</p>",
  "<p>There are many reasons to welcome the verdict in the trial of Anders Behring Breivik: that he is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/24/breivik-verdict-sane-21-years\" title=\"\">sane and legally responsible</a> for the murder of 77 people \u2013 mostly members of the Norwegian Labour party \u2013 on 22 July last year.</p> <p>The guilty verdict recognises the monstrosity of Breivik's acts, carried out in pursuit of his political beliefs. It also delivers the outcome wanted by the majority of Norwegians, in particular because it means he will spend no fewer than 21 years \u2013 and most likely life \u2013 in jail. Justice has been done to the fullest extent possible under Norwegian law.</p> <p>To understand the full import of the outcome, however, one needs to look to the wider realms of politics and society. The trial was dominated by the question of Breivik's sanity for more than just procedural reasons.</p> <p>Once it was realised a white, middle-class Norwegian man was the culprit and that he'd left a sickening but coherent 1,500-page manifesto for all to read, the race was on for some on the right to depoliticise Breivik's acts. The problem was that his politics were not just similar to their own, but often drawn directly from their statements, cut and pasted into his tract. In many cases the only difference was that he took their language of a war of civilisations to its logical conclusion in violence.</p> <p>It wasn't just harder rightwingers such as <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2020924/Anders-Behring-Breivik-Liberals-hell-bent-bullying-silence.html\" title=\"\">Melanie Phillips</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/272617/islamophobia-and-mass-murder-mark-steyn\" title=\"\">Mark Steyn</a> and <a href=\"http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/2011/07/summer-camp-indoctrination-training-center.html\" title=\"\">Pamela Geller</a> who tried to deny the connection, but many more moderate writers and politicians. This should not be surprising, as Breivik's opposition to Muslims, multiculturalism and a \"cultural Marxist\" fifth column was never far from the surface in the mainstream discourse of the war on terror. Norway, for all its famed tolerance, continues to be an active part of the Nato occupation of Afghanistan.</p> <p>The main form this depoliticisation took was the medicalisation of Breivik's actions in terms of psychological or psychiatric pathology. Within days, everyone from forensic psychiatrists to the London mayor, Boris Johnson, felt the need to put Breivik in a diagnostic box. Occasionally, even reportage of his personal history and psychology went to ludicrous extremes to seek his motives in anything but what he actually said. This reached its pinnacle with the first court-ordered psychiatric report, which found him to be suffering from \"paranoid schizophrenia\" on the basis of clumsy and inappropriate interpretation of ideas and behaviours common in far-right and online gaming subcultures.</p> <p>Outrage over the findings led the court to take the unusual step of commissioning a second report. This one paid more attention to his political milieu, as well as his behaviour in jail, and found him sane \u2013 at most exhibiting signs of a personality disorder. Friday's verdict confirms this conclusion and denies to Islamophobic ideologues the comfort of a clear line of sanity separating their influence from Breivik's actions.</p> <p>The verdict is doubly important as an intractable economic crisis across Europe provides opportunities for the advance of the far right. Virtually all of these rightwing parties disowned Breivik's actions while singling out in their own propaganda the same groups he targeted. At one extreme, Greece's neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party has seen its electoral support rocket to 7%, even as its thugs carry out violent attacks on migrants in the streets of Athens. But much wider networks of extreme rightwingers populate the internet and organisations of the populist right, exactly the spaces in which Breivik's ideology and commitment to action were formed.</p> <p>Friday's verdict thus not only delivers justice, it also clarifies the connection between his crimes and how dangerous rightwing ideologies have infiltrated an apparently \"sane\" mainstream discourse. It is a problem that cannot be expunged simply by labelling it as mad, but must be tackled directly as the political threat to freedom and democracy it is.</p>",
  "<p>A builder who killed six people, including his wife and their two children, in knife attacks on Jersey was convicted of six counts of manslaughter on Friday after a 10-day trial.</p> <p>Damian Rzeszowski, 31, also killed his wife's father, a friend and her daughter with kitchen knives at their home in August last year.</p> <p>The Polish national, who has been held at Broadmoor hospital since his arrest, denied murder, pleading guilty to manslaughter through diminished responsibility \u2013 pleas not accepted by the prosecution.</p> <p>The court at St Helier heard that Rzeszowski's marriage had been under strain after his wife confessed to a two-month affair with another man and he threatened to kill himself. His defence argued he had moderate to severe depression, causing an onset of psychotic symptoms. He will be sentenced on 29 October.</p> <p>No members of the victims' families were in court to hear the presiding judge, Sir Michael Birt, read out the verdicts reached by two jurats, whose role is similar to magistrates in the UK</p> <p>Those killed were Rzeszowski's wife, Izabela, 30, daughter, Kinga, five, son, Kacper, two, father-in-law, Marek Garstka, 56, Marta De La Haye, 34, and her five-year-old daughter, Julia.</p> <p>The trial heard that Izabela told him in June 2011 she had been involved in an affair with another man. He had previously caught her flirting with other men online and she had confessed she no longer loved him. In turn, he retaliated by having a one-night stand, which he told his wife about.</p> <p>But after Rzeszowski took an overdose in July last year, the couple agreed they would try to save their marriage and went to Poland to visit their families. On the day of their return to Jersey, his wife and her father went for a barbecue with De La Haye and her daughter, leaving the children in Rzeszowski's care. On their return, they found he had gone out and left the children by themselves. When he reappeared at about 1pm, his wife remonstrated with him.</p> <p>Rzeszowski said he was unable to remember what happened next but the prosecution told the trial the killings began at about 2.45pm. It believed Garstka was the first to be attacked. He was lying on a bed when he was stabbed nine times with two knives.</p> <p>Kacper, was probably playing with a toy car when he was attacked, according to the prosecution. The boy was stabbed 13 times with two different kitchen knives. The girls, who had been painting, were stabbed 16 times each.</p> <p>Rzeszowski, who had been drinking whisky, attacked his wife in the flat but she ran out into a courtyard. As she tried to call the police, she dialled the Polish emergency services number. Out on the street, she was stabbed again in front of neighbours. Her friend, De La Haye, was also attacked and staggered out of the flat before collapsing.</p> <p>As neighbours tried to intervene, Rzeszowski started stabbing himself and fell to the ground with a collapsed lung.</p> <p>The solicitor general, Howard Sharp, told the court that Rzeszowski had a history of violence. He had been involved in up to 10 fights since moving to Jersey in 2005 and was a \"pressure cooker who lacks a safety valve\".</p> <p>He added: \"This is the case of a man who cannot face the prospect of marriage failure and decides that, if the family cannot go on as it is, it must not go on at all.\"</p>",
  "<p>Under a blood-red sky in gentle Lancashire, a band of eager victims have come to experience Horror Camp Live, a gore-tastic camping night incongruously pitched at a working dairy farm near Blackburn, home of Mrs Dowson's Ice Cream. I have arrived late.</p> <p>A cocktail of medicines with which I am treating a stomach bug start to take haphazard effect on my body. \"I think I'm a bit high,\" I whisper to my companion, Emily.</p> <p>This does go some way to stilling the riptide of anxiety I've been feeling since reading the event's website, in particular the small print. \"You may be forcibly handled, bound, hooded, chained and subjected to simulated torture,\" it says. In addition to \"strong verbal and graphic visual sexual content\", I'm told to expect the use of \"total darkness, water spray and splash, crouch spaces and latex\".</p> <p>It sounds like 50 Shades of Guant\u00e1namo Bay. The website also has a convoluted back story about a cannibal neurosurgeon called Lockjaw which I don't understand at all, but it doesn't seem to have much bearing on the experience anyway.&#xa0;</p> <p>On arrival we find the Horror Camp team have helpfully pitched the guest tents around a huge campfire in the farm's large parkland. Beyond us in every direction roll the beautiful fields of Clayton-le-Dale. We briefly introduce ourselves, before moving into a dim shed for burgers and (very) local ice cream at 9pm. We also watch a horror film, Scarezone, which feels unnecessary \u2013 everyone really wants to get on with being terrorised by strangers in makeup.</p> <p>Scarezone's teen-American spunkiness is also ill-suited to the very British camp-ness of the night, which manifests itself in jokey transvestism and saucy innuendo, traded relentlessly by our grown-up scout guides Davey and Dawny.</p> <p>\"Are we in Skegness?\" Emily asks me early on. Eventually, however, as the night draws in, man-eating Lockjaw wrests control of our night from the adults in shorts, and the games begin.</p> <p>Far from the solitary nightmare I was expecting, the evening is a rambunctious, group-bonding jolly. Among the 30 horror fans here are a paranormal investigator and a couple celebrating their wedding anniversary. The female-weighted group immediately gets into the spirit.</p> <p>I had anticipated running scared through the woods, but we spend most of the night in the screening shed, where a virtual Lockjaw growls at us via a projector. He seems fixated less on sweet flesh than on setting up his own misguided Duke of Edinburgh scheme: we're sent striding around the farm with maps, and conga-lining through grimy tunnels.</p> <p>After each mission he rewards us with DVDs and Toffifee sweets. Proceedings veer close to a comedy night in a working men's club thanks to the quick wit and foul mouth of Dybuk, an \"old fortune-telling Irish Gypsy\" who harangues each team at length between their 20-minute excursions. I wince slightly at the \"Gypsy\" description, but leave political correctness at the door; she's a far more rounded and charming character than the other guides and ghouls.</p> <p>Emily, whom I have tricked into coming, is dressed inappropriately, tramping through cowpats in hotpants and ballet flats. She's quite angry with me, but I'm starting to really enjoy myself. There's a creepily beguiling doll who silently beckons us on masked dates. We visit a twisted surgeon in an outhouse who sounds like he has throat cancer. We're kidnapped, bundled into vans and driven to seances and Satanic masses, all the while singing The Farmer Wants A Wife. We happily eat insects. Around us, the cows low non-judgmentally. It's like a Halloween hen night, though for safety reasons the beers are restricted to two per person, and running is not allowed.</p> <p>Scare attractions are a growing trend in UK entertainment. Atmosfear, the entertainment group behind tonight's fun, will run a larger Halloween \"scream park\", a sort of Crystal Maze of terror, on the farm in October and November, with a larger cast of scare-actors and more zones of political incorrectness to navigate \u2013 Inbreeds Impound, Gaunt Hill Asylum \u2026</p> <p>The Horror Camp is a more intimate thrill, though sensation junkies might find insufficient threat here (aside from Dybuk's deliciously close-to-the-knuckle verbal abuse). Blindfolded in the back of a van, I listen with bemusement to the plaint of a female camper beside me: \"I was told I'd be hooded and bound. I'm not bound!\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395157235\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/8/23/1345732911903/Face-to-face-with-canniba-008.jpg\" alt=\"Face-to-face with cannibal neurosurgeon Lockjaw\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Face-to-face with cannibal neurosurgeon Lockjaw</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The schlocky shenanigans \"end\" around 2.30am, and we retire to our canvas sanctuaries. But don't count on a quiet night. One after-hours prank \u2013 enacting every camper's worst nightmare \u2013 succeeds in scaring me stupid. Ripped from sleep, I wake to my own screaming. If that sounds like your bag, you know where to come.</p> <p>As I've failed to organise our travel with any degree of sense, bespattered Emily and I are ferried back to town the next morning by Mr Dowson, a farmer definitely not in want of a wife \u2013 her name adorns the signs around us.</p> <p>After all the monsters, it's nice to put a human face to Hawkshaw Farm. We talk about how falling milk prices impose a harsh choice on UK dairy farmers: branch out or shut up shop.</p> <p>\"For most, diversifying means getting a yoghurt counter,\" he says. \"We've tried to be a bit more creative.\"</p> <p>I listen to his gruesome ideas for how Horror Camp can go much, much further. The organisers, who are planning to develop the night, should listen to him, too. My stomach, dormant until now, has started to lurch again.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The next Horror Camp Live (0845 519 4271, </em><a href=\"http://www.horrorcamplive.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>horrorcamplive.co.uk</em></a><em>) is on 29 September, 8pm-9am, \u00a385pp. No under-14s, under-18s must be accompanied by an adult.

  "<p>Angela Merkel has rejected pleas from her Greek counterpart for a two-year repayment extension after receiving backing from the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, for her hardline stance.</p> <p>The German chancellor said it was up to the people of Greece to show they can implement austerity measures agreed with Brussels and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) before there could be any further discussion about the latest \u20ac130bn (\u00a3103bn) debt package.</p> <p>But she softened the blow with a commitment to wait for a report next month on the progress by Athens to cut government spending and implement far reaching tax and labour market reforms. She said Greece should stay in the euro \"and that's what I'm working for.\"</p> <p>The uncertainty surrounding the eventual outcome of talks between Antonio Samaras, the Greek prime minister, and the troika of representatives from the IMF, Brussels and the European Central Bank unsettled markets before the bank holiday.</p> <p>Reports that the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, had conducted talks in Brussels over a possible bailout package were denied by all sides, but added to the uncertainty surrounding the euro.</p> <p>Weak manufacturing data from the US added to the gloomy picture, especially after figures this week showing the eurozone heading for a second recession after the financial crash in 2008.</p> <p>Barack Obama has expressed fears that the eurozone will drag down the US economy and wreck hopes of a recovery this year. His Republican rival in the November election, Mitt Romney, told Fox News he would replace the Federal Reserve governor Ben Bernanke at the first opportunity with someone more in tune with his conservative views.</p> <p>Romney wants the Fed to roll back its quantitative easing programme, believing it has little effect and could store up pressure for inflation in the next few years.</p> <p>Bernanke, who has dismissed fears of inflation, said last week that he could embark on QE3 after a succession of weak figures from the US services sector alongside a drop in manufacturing.</p> <p>China, Brazil and India's economies are also slowing with each country blaming Europe for depressed international trade and nervousness in the banking sector. Stock markets, which had fallen all day, recovered slightly by the close after sources in the European Central Bank said it was poised for a massive bond buying spree to bring down the interest rate for the most debt ridden eurozone countries.</p> <p>The ECB is understood to be considering setting internal yield band targets under a new bond-buying programme to allow it to keep its strategy shielded and avoid speculators trying to cash in, central bank sources told Reuters. Such a strategy would bring down yields, which translate into the interest rates countries can borrow at, without traders knowing where the ECB will stop buying.</p> <p>Samaras, who arrived in Berlin with his foreign secretary and finance minister, has spent much of the week arguing that his country should have more time beyond the mid-2014 deadline to complete reforms that are a condition of it continuing to receive bailout loans. Without the help, Greece would be forced into a chaotic default on its debts and could be forced out of the eurozone.</p> <p>Leading German politicians have voiced deep scepticism about granting Greece any concessions. Merkel and Hollande, meeting a day before Samaras came to Berlin, put the onus squarely on Greece to fulfill its pledges.</p> <p>Greece has faltered in the speed and effectiveness of implementing the reforms irritating creditors, notably Germany, which is the single largest contributor to its two bailout packages, totalling \u20ac240bn.</p> <p>Merkel said: \"To win back confidence, we must fulfill expectations, and so I made clear in the talks that we of course expect from Greece that the commitments that were made be implemented, that deeds follow words.</p> <p>\"But fulfilling expectations also means that Greece can rightly expect from Germany that we do not pass premature judgments.\" Merkel added that Germany needed to wait for the debt inspectors' report.</p> <p>The Athens coalition government has said it was considering passing a law blocking politicians from hiring relatives as staff after a series of corruption scandals.</p>",
  "<p>The darkest chapter in Norway's recent history came to a close, as judges delivered a sentence that is likely to see Anders Behring Breivik spend the rest of his life in prison, before they read out harrowing accounts of the gun and bomb attacks he perpetrated last year.</p> <p>An Oslo court found that Breivik, whose twin assaults killed 77 people, was sane \u2013 the verdict that he and most Norwegians had wanted.</p> <p>The conclusion of Norway's most high-profile judicial case for decades provoked immediate calls for the country to engage in a more rounded and open debate on multiculturalism.</p> <p>Survivors and relatives welcomed the court's decision, saying they were now able to move on with their lives, 13 months after Breivik detonated a bomb in Oslo and embarked on a shooting rampage on Ut\u00f8ya island. More than half of those shot were teenagers.</p> <p>The 33-year-old, who had earlier admitted the attacks that traumatised the peaceful country, smirked as the court's verdict was delivered. He was given the maximum sentence of 21 years, but with a \"preventive detention\" clause that means his time in jail can be extended as long as he is deemed a threat to society. It is unlikely he will ever be released.</p> <p>In a final parting shot, clearly designed to offend, Breivik used his chance to address the court by apologising to \"militant nationalists\" across Europe, apparently for not killing more people during his two attacks.</p> <p>More than 60 relatives and survivors of the attacks nodded silently in the Oslo courtroom as the verdict was delivered by Judge Wenche Elisabeth Arntzen. Later they could be seen embracing one another. Most of the Norwegian public had hoped for a \"sanity\" verdict, eager that the killer should be made accountable for what they viewed as a political crime. Breivik sought the same outcome, believing it would legitimise the ideology that inspired his attacks.</p> <p>Away from the courthouse, a feeling of closure was soon evident throughout the nation. Bj\u00f8rn Kasper Ilaug, a rescue worker at Ut\u00f8ya, said: \"The verdict is positive toward a situation where we can start moving forward. That is very important. This has been a heavy burden for many people for 13 months.\"</p> <p>Breivik had targeted a summer camp of the youth wing of the country's ruling Labour party, which was taking place on the island. Another Ut\u00f8ya survivor, Frida Holm Skoglund, 20, said: \"I'm going to fully live the first day of the rest of my life.\" Skoglund had remained so shaken by her ordeal that, in May, she requested that Breivik leave the courtroom before she could deliver her witness testimony.</p> <p>Others described a sense of instant calm. Per Balch S\u00f8rensen, whose daughter was killed on Ut\u00f8ya, said: \"Now we can have peace and quiet. He doesn't mean anything to me. He is just air.\"</p> <p>Within moments of the verdict, lawyers for the victims were being inundated with celebratory emails. Mette Yvonne Larsen, who represented some of those affected, said: \"This is what we hoped for. I have already received many messages from clients telling me this is justice served and they are happy it's over and will never have to see him [Breivik] again.\"</p> <p>The killings induced a period of introspection for a nation of 5 million which had prided itself as a safe and stable society, and also raised questions about the prevalence of far-right views in a country where oil wealth has encouraged one of the fastest immigration rates in Europe.</p> <p>Many Norwegians believe their country must use the verdict as a platform to instigate an examination of the virtues or otherwise of mass immigration for its society.</p> <p>Breivik said that he had deliberately targeted those he felt encouraged multiculturalism, and that he wanted to overcome an \"invasion of Muslims\". Jo Stigen, professor at the department for public and international law at the University of Oslo, said: \"It was a political attack. Now we can focus on how to avoid this in the future.\"</p> <p>Mads Anden\u00e6s, a lawyer and professor at the university, who lost a student during Breivik's killing spree, said: \"Everybody is happy with this as the end of the process. Discussion about immigration and racism and how [Breivik's] attitude was possible to develop can now start.\"</p> <p>Chief among the issues to be explored will be how Breivik could emerge in a society with one of the lowest homicide rates in the world. Ut\u00f8ya survivor Eivind Rindal was among those who warned that Breivik's ideological, far-right discourse was far from unique. \"There are many who shared his extreme views in our society,\" she said. The judges agreed, noting that Breivik's anti-immigration views were shared by a nexus of like-minded individuals and disparate groups.</p> <p>However, they found no evidence that the Knights Templar, the modern-day crusader network that Breivik claimed to belong to, exists. The killer appeared to blush each time the organisation was mentioned during the court hearing.</p> <p>One aspect of the judgment was seemingly to make sure Breivik's actions were not forgotten, with the judges delivering a harrowing reminder of his attacks as they documented, over several hours, each of the gunshot and bomb-blast injuries suffered by those killed and the 242 wounded. The court heard some women were shot up to eight times, many cold-bloodedly with bullets to the head. As the details were described, Breivik could sometimes be seen frantically writing notes; at other times, he looked flustered.</p> <p>Legal experts said the detailing of his crimes was intended to provide a final, graphic reminder of his actions, should he ever appeal to be released.</p> <p>One of the judges, Arne Lyng, revealed that the 950kg fertiliser bomb Breivik detonated outside the government headquarters could have been significantly more devastating. \"It was pure luck that not many more were killed,\" he said.</p> <p>The killer refused to express remorse, arguing that his victims were brainwashed \"cultural Marxists\" whose political activism would adulterate pure Norwegian blood, and stating that he would commit his attacks again.</p> <p>The court's verdict signalled closure for Norway in another way: its finding of sanity means that Breivik will not appeal against his jail term. Geir Lippestad, his lawyer, was unequivocal: \"He told me he will accept this verdict.\"</p> <p>As the hearing continued, some felt the mood of the proceedings tangibly lift as it sank home that it might be Breivik's last public appearance.</p> <p>Ali Esbati, Swedish survivor on Ut\u00f8ya remarked that the courtoom did not feel as \"oppressive\" as it usually had throughout the 10-week trial.</p> <p>\"Many must feel that today marks a certain end to the process,\" he said.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 August 2012.

  "<p>When I was younger I worked for a while on a hospital psychiatric ward as an orderly. I distinctly remember this lovely former headmistress who was gripped by the unusual fear that her body was hollow and full of urine. She would sleep sitting up because she believed that if she lay flat the urine would flow up into her throat and she would drown. Any inclination towards the horizontal and she would begin to cough and splutter.</p> <p>One afternoon, much taken with youthful confidence, I decided to reason her out of her bizarre belief system. She was clearly a clever woman, knowledgable about the world, and could complete the Times crossword in under an hour. So I sat beside her bed and tried to explain why these fears couldn't possibly be true. I got absolutely nowhere. Every question had a reasoned response. Her whole world-view seemed entirely consistent. There was no way of breaking it down. It was rigid and impenetrable. And therein lay her madness.</p> <p>In a celebrated essay on Russian literature, Isaiah Berlin famously borrowed a quotation from the Greek poet Archilochus to distinguish two very different sorts of thinkers: \"The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.\" The fox, like Berlin himself, can commit to a plurality of values, even when they are incommensurable.</p> <p>The hedgehog wants to subsume all reality under a single idea or principle. Speaking for myself, I fear hedgehogs, whatever the brand of reality they want to sign up to. Yet hedgehogs, and certainly clever ones, are well defended by their consistency. By contrast, foxes are in the awkward and vulnerable position of contradicting themselves. I love the church. I hate the church. I believe in God. I don't believe in God. I do it all the time. And I am totally unrepentant. It seems to me that one of the marks of sanity is that one can live with contradiction.</p> <p>Arguing with people about religion, as I often do, especially with fundamentalists of either the pro- or anti- camp, can feel a lot like arguing with the headmistress. It's a battle of world-views each of which reckons its truth is to be revealed in its internal coherence. Much effort is thus placed on avoiding contradiction. And arguments all seem to be about reaching that \"ah hah\" moment when an opponent has discovered a contradiction in the other person's position. Well, so what? Only the mad never contradict themselves.</p> <p>This week I have been reading Dostoyevsky again. And one of the most exciting things about his writing is the way he manages to portray A and not A at the same time. The Brothers Karamazov contains a devastating critique of faith and an astonishing defence of it.</p> <p>Perhaps it is the privilege of the novelist not to have to abide by the law of non-contradiction. For the commitment of the novelist is to recognise the world as a bigger place. And this requires the articulation of many different, divergent, contradictory voices. It is a consequence of having an entirely non-defensive attitude towards the world. Herein lies a very different approach to truth: that it begins with absolute truthfulness.</p> <p>The reason most of us don't take this path is that we are fearful. We huddle together for ideological warmth, preferring the safety of party-mindedness to exposure to the chill winds of contradiction. This is especially true of politicians and newspaper columnists. Yet thinking is always crippled by false certainty. Dostoyevsky shows us that stupid is the price we pay for wisdom.</p>",
  "<p>In 2004 Lance Armstrong sat in a press conference at the start of the Tour de France in the Belgian city of Li\u00e8ge, a week or so after the first serious allegations that he had used performance-enhancing drugs had appeared in the book LA Confidentiel, written by David Walsh and Pierre Ballester. Armstrong looked straight at Walsh, who was sitting in the front row and said: \"Extraordinary allegations require extraordinary evidence.\" That settled the argument. For a while.</p> <p>To Walsh and Ballester should go credit: they initiated the long, contorted process of revelation that has led the US Anti-Doping Agency (Usada) to hand Armstrong a lifetime ban and strip him of his seven Tour titles. The process had reached a watershed on Friday morning when Armstrong conceded that he did not wish to confront evidence that had been put together by Usada from accounts provided by 10 former team-mates which had led it to charge Armstrong with blood doping, the use of erythropoietin (EPO), testosterone and other substances, among other things. Had he conceded that the case should go to arbitration, he would have had to face those charges in a public forum. That evidence could have been \"extraordinary\": but Armstrong chose not to find out what it was. It is rare, possibly unprecedented, for Armstrong to withdraw from any combat. Fighting is his way, and always has been. But steering away from exposure of that evidence is the only outcome that permits Armstrong to maintain any semblance of control of proceedings, and to cling on to any scraps of the myth he has built around himself. But he does so with all the credibility of one of those fabled Japanese soldiers who hid on Pacific islands convinced that the second world war was still going on.</p> <p>By avoiding having to give formal answers to the detailed allegations of his team-mates, he can continue to contend that the process was flawed, that Usada has indulged in a witch hunt, and he can state until he is blue in the face that he has never tested positive. (Back in 2000, at the start of a Tour de France stage, a close associate of the Texan told me emphatically that he would never, ever test positive. How right he was. But how pointless the notion.) Those arguments are now simply countered: if he has never used drugs, why did he not argue against the point in a formal setting? He has done that before, notably in the case against his insurers, SCA, and caused the opposition to settle.</p> <p>It is strange now to contemplate the Armstrong journey. It is just under 20 years since I was introduced to a brash, extremely quick-witted Texan youth who had recently turned professional with the Motorola team. I liked him. And I was not alone. His great critic and eventual sworn enemy, the \"troll in chief\", Walsh, felt the same way when they first met in 1993. In 1997 and 1998 Armstrong could only be respected for the scale of the challenge he had taken on: returning from cancer to attempt to race again.</p> <p>It is important to recall these things now, because we should remember that Armstrong has not always been what he has been since the early 2000s. He has not always been lawsuit-happy, was not always ready to browbeat those who raised their voices against him. If he goes down in cycling history as the biggest name to fall from grace among an entire generation that was tainted by drug-taking, that is partly because of the scale of what he achieved, partly because of the length of time during which he persisted in flying in the face of the evidence. Lance Armstrong's personal war is over now.</p> <p>The sport should not be wringing its hands at this. The concession is sudden, the revelations anything but. It is not a case of \"say it ain't so\" but \"say it, and let us move on\". For the last eight years the weight of evidence against Armstrong has built inexorably: the two-year investigation by Walsh and Ballester that produced a book full of circumstantial evidence but no smoking gun; the positive tests for EPO uncovered in 2005 during research on samples from the 1999 Tour; most recently, the detailed account from his former team-mates, Tyler Hamilton and Floyd Landis, about doping practices at the Texan's US Postal Service. The Usada released a statement on Friday evening outlining the anti-doping rules that Armstrong had violated since 1998 as they justified the ban and removal of his titles. More details will emerge, and soon: to start with, Hamilton's account of his career and his doping will appear within a few weeks.</p> <p>The discussion over the status of Armstrong's seven Tour de France victories is irrelevant. Other than their place in the records, those results ceased to have a great deal of meaning as long ago as 2006-7 once it became clear, from the Operaci\u00f3n Puerto inquiry that an entire generation of cyclists, Armstrong's generation \u2013 Jan Ullrich, Ivan Basso, Alexandr Vinokourov and company \u2013 were tainted with blood doping. The Tour wins remained Armstrong's, but the standings beneath them became devoid of all sense. Now, the question of who the Tour wins should be awarded to would be an amusing party game were it not a grotesque illustration of a sport which completely lost its way in the early years of this century.</p> <p>The Armstrong concession that he cannot win the case against Usada matters, because cycling can look, learn and move on. It already has moved on, in terms of how doping is discussed and the weight of opinion against it. Indeed, for several years now Armstrong has seemed like a man out of his time.</p> <p>The tone of the time was shown in a lengthy interview by Armstrong's former team-mate Jonathan Vaughters this week in Bicycling magazine. Vaughters argued with great authority \u2013 authority born of experience at every end of the spectrum \u2013 why the fight against doping matters. To be deterred from doping, athletes need to feel \u2013 as Vaughters did \u2013 that they have more to lose from doping than they have to gain. Tests need to be strengthened, as they were in cycling after Armstrong quit for the first time in 2005.</p> <p>By taking on Armstrong and pushing him to the point where he felt he would rather not contest the evidence, Travis Tygart and Usada have shown that no athlete can consider themselves immune from being pursued over doping allegations. As Bradley Wiggins argued recently in this paper, and David Millar has stated repeatedly in the past, to prevent doping, the temptation to dope needs to be countered in the athlete's mind with \"why would I?\" rather than \"why wouldn't I?\". In the sport's progress down that path, the Armstrong concession is indeed extraordinary.</p>",
  "<p>\"If you like anchovies on your pizza you'd better be careful,\" warns Mark Livingston, investment director of Fidelity Worldwide Investment.</p> <p>You would not expect the head of a global asset fund managing \u00a3138bn of pensions and investments to care about the cost of pizza toppings. But the global nature of the food chain means severe storms off the coast of Peru have led to a dramatic jump in the price of the oily fish \u2013 which will in turn lead to a spike in Scottish farmed fish, Chinese pigs and even Omega 3 tablets in Holland &amp; Barratt.</p> <p>\"That's the nature of today's food business \u2013 everything's connected,\" Livingston says. \"If you can catch some anchovies you'll make some serious money.\"</p> <p>And that's why Livingston cares about this silvery-coloured fish. Three years ago Fidelity spotted the growing importance of the \"forgotten fish\" and invested in Copeinca, a Norwegian company that owns a fleet of 30 Peruvian anchovy fishing boats and five processing plants across the country.</p> <p>Just a few years ago no one outside of the fish oil industry really paid much attention to anchovies and they were lumped together with other unloved fish under the unappetising label \"industrial fish\".</p> <p>\"It covers all the stuff we don't consume directly. We caught 18m tonnes of industrial fish last year, which represents 20% of all fish caught worldwide,\" says Gorjan Nikolik, associate director of animal protein at Rabobank.</p> <p>These fish are caught in massive quantities, dried, minced and ground down into fish meal [a brown powder made mostly from fish bones and fish offal] and fish oil [which is extracted from the tissues of oily fish].</p> <p>\"After two years of declining prices, fish meal and fish oil are becoming expensive again. And people are now paying attention,\" says Nikolik from his office in Utrecht, the Netherlands' fourth city.</p> <p>He says the price of fish oil has increased from $1,500 (\u00a3950) a tonne at the beginning of the year to $2,000 per tonne this month; fish meal has jumped from $1,300 a tonne to a record $1,700.</p> <p>The price is rising due to the growth in farmed fish [mostly salmon and prawns], which feed on them, and the substitition of fish meal as animal feed because corn has become too expensive: the corn price has hit a record high as a result of the severe drought in the US.</p> <p>Fish oil has soared even further because a new consumer has emerged: humans. \"Direct consumption in the form of Omega 3 pills has increased to 14% [of the global fish oil production] from 2%-3% five years ago,\" says Nikolik.</p> <p>Peruvian anchovy fishermen \u2013 and their investors \u2013 are the biggest beneficiary of the fish oil spike because, Livingston says, \"the Peruvian anchovy is the best fish in the world to produce fish oil as they have the most calories\".</p> <p>The anchovy price [which is not available separately but calculated from the fish oil price] has increased still further because since 2009 the Peruvian government has imposed quotas on the number of anchovies that can be caught in their waters. \"They've limited the supply, which will all know lifts the price.\"</p> <p>Additionally, unusually severe Pacific storms have made anchovies much harder to catch. \"The strange weather patterns have made the sea more turbulent and less people are willing to go out into the sea \u2013 which increases the cost of fishing.\"</p> <p>\"And on top of that,\" Livingston adds pausing for breath. \"There's this push into organic fertiliser.\" Fish meal will pass an approved organic feed, as consumers increasingly demand food that hasn't been plied with chemical fertiliser.</p> <p>In any ordinary year the soaring price of fish oil and meal should force up salmon prices, Nikolik says. But this is no ordinary year. This year salmon have been hungry.</p> <p>\"In 2012 the water temperature has been a couple of degrees warmer in the north Atlantic than normal. This has had a big affect on the appetite of salmon, which has led to a record growth rate.\"</p> <p>Norway, the world's biggest salmon farmer ahead of Chile and Scotland, only expected a 5% increase in the salmon crop this year but global salmon production is already up 30% in the first half of the year. Chile's salmon fisheries are also recovering from a disease that forced them to kill 75% of the stock two years ago.</p> <p>\"This has led to a dramatic price drop of 35-40%,\" he says. \"Last year salmon was changing hands at 38-43 Norwegian kroner per kilo, it's crashed to 25 kroner.\"</p> <p>Nikolik says the salmon industry has not been subject to such a steep price change since the fish farming industry took off in the 1970s and 80s.</p> <p>The price collapse has translated into cheaper prices and promotions in supermarkets across the world.</p> <p>\"It is a great deal for consumers and producers,\" he says. \"The prices are so low that new people are trying salmon \u2013 and if they get hooked producers will have new customers. It's like a year-long special promotion.\"</p> <p>Nikolik says prices have been so depressed that even hard-pressed consumers have taken to eating more of a once exclusively upmarket fish. European salmon consumption in the first half of the year is up to 419,00 tonnes from 342,000 tonnes last year. \"We've seen growth in Portugal, Greece, Spain \u2013 places where you would expect recession to have reduced demand.\"</p> <p>The fast-developing Bric nations are also increasingly keen on salmon. Industry figures show Russian salmon consumption is up 67% to 75,000 tonnes in the first six months of the year, while Latin Amercia (particularly Brazil) is up 85%, even China which does not have a tradition of eating fish fillets has seen salmon consumption rise by 34%.</p> <p>While salmon is leaping, its more down-to-earth cousin mackerel is plunging. A diplomatic dispute between Iceland and the Faroe islands against the EU, Ireland and Norway has led to severe overfishing of north Atlantic mackerel stocks.</p> <p>Simon Coveney, Ireland's agriculture minister, has accused Iceland of making a \"financial killing\" from fishing mackerel in defiance of a EU-agreed quota.</p> <p>Iceland claims that rising sea temperatures have led to a \"dramatic change\" in mackerel's migration route into its territorial waters. \"We've seen 1.1m tonnes of mackerel in Icelandic waters in 2012, 2011 and 2010, compared to very little in 2006 and 2005,\" says Friirik Arngr\u00edmsson, head of the Federation of Icelandic Fishing Vessel Owners. \"The mackerel is feeding here and increasing its weight here \u2013 we have a right to fish our mackerel.\"</p> <p>The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (Ices), which advises governments on fish quotas, has counselled landing not more than 630,000 tonnes of mackerel. Iceland says the EU and Norway have allocated themselves 90% of that catch.</p> <p>\"That leaves 10% to Iceland, the Faroes and Russia \u2013 that's not a fair share,\" argues Arngr\u00edmsson. \"We cannot accept that the EU can decide whether or not we should fish mackerel. They have claimed that it is their fish, but it is also our fish.\"</p> <p>While Arngr\u00edmsson admits that until recently Iceland regarded mackerel as only a bycatch to herring, he strongly refutes the suggestion that Iceland has only started to bother catching mackerel since its financial system went into meltdown in 2008. \"There is absolutely no link between the Icelandic banks and the mackerel. It is just a coincidence that the mackerel has migrated into Icelandic waters.\"</p> <p>Back on dry land, drought in the US has wiped out 45% of the corn and 35% of the soya bean crop in the worst harvest since 1988. As well as leading to the soaring price of those commodities [corn is up 64% since June] it has also caused a spike in all other cereals and animal feeds, including wheat, hay and fish meal [which is increasingly used to feed China's growing demand for pork].</p> <p>Many cattle farmers are no longer able to afford to feed their cows and the US herd has shrunk to its smallest since 1973. Cattle prices have risen by 8.5% to $1.35 a pound.</p> <p>Fast-food chain Wendy's has already warned it will be forced to raise the price of burgers. The real losers will be the world's poorest. \"If the current food price rises continue it will lead to food inflation, which will be very bad for poor countries,\" says Livingston. \"It doesn't matter where prices are rising, it is always the poorest people that suffer most because food makes up a much bigger part of their outgoings. We can afford to absorb the rise \u2026 \"</p> <p>He warns that if prices keep going up it will become a food crisis that could match the severity of the 2008 food riots that helped spark the Arab spring.</p> <p>While most dread the repeat of such a crisis some of the multimillionaires that control the global food market are anticipating the opportunity to make vast profits.</p> <p>The head of Glencore's food trading business this week said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/21/glencore-us-drought-good-for-business\" title=\"\">the food crisis would be \"good\" for business</a>.</p> <p>Chris Mahoney, the trader's director of agricultural products, who owns about \u00a3500m of Glencore shares, said: \"The environment is a good one. High prices, lots of volatility, a lot of dislocation, tightness, a lot of arbitrage [the purchase and sale of an asset in order to profit from price differences in different markets] opportunities.</p> <p>\"We will be able to provide the world with solutions\u2026 and that should also be good for Glencore.\"</p> <h2>Orange juice</h2> <p>Orange juice prices surged 14% this week as a tropical storm is expected to strike Florida, the world's second-biggest producer after Brazil.</p> <p>The price of orange juice, which has this year swung from record highs of $2.2 a pound to near-record lows, hit $1.40 this week as tropical storm Isaac was heading directly for the southern US state.</p> <p>However, Judith Ganes-Chase, president of J. Ganes Consulting, a commodity trading company, warned that the price will fall again as there is falling demand.</p> <p>Tea prices are also on the up, with some varieties soaring by more than 40% so far this year. William Gorman, chairman of the UK Tea Council, said strong demand from India and China was causing the surge. Climate change is alsoharming some previously excellent tea growing regions.</p> <p><strong>Lionel Badal</strong></p>",
  "<p>Tens of thousands of Republicans are beginning to gather in Tampa, Florida, for the party convention beginning Monday, at which Mitt Romney, still largely unknown to many Americans, has to sell himself as the next president.</p> <p>He has four days to define himself and, in front of a viewing audience of 20 million plus, to deliver the speech of a lifetime. At the end, he will be looking for a 'bounce', a poll lead that will last through to November 6. The size of that bounce, if any, will be the first serious indicator of how the election is likely to turn out.</p> <p>The pressure on Romney \u2013 currently in a statistical dead heat with Barack Obama nationally, according to the Real Clear Politics average of polls, but trailing in most of the swing states \u2013 is enormous. It is not just the prospect of the convention being disrupted by tropical storm Isaac, which could hit Tampa early next week, or controversies such as the Todd Akin rape-abortion row. It is that Romney is generally an uninspiring orator.</p> <p>\"I suspect I'm like a lot of voters in the middle who are still waiting to see some signs of life, humanity, conviction, personality, biography, vision. Just show me more than the one-dimensional 'I'm not Obama' campaign we've seen so far,\" Mark McKinnon, a campaign adviser to both George W Bush and the 2008 presidential candidate John McCain, <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/08/09/what-mitt-romney-needs-to-do-in-tampa\">wrote on the Daily Beast</a> website.</p> <p>He added: \"No pressure, Mitt. But your chances of winning the presidency may rest entirely on the ability to stand and deliver in Tampa.\"</p> <p>Conventions were once synonymous with unpredictable dramas. In 1976, Ronald Reagan tried unsuccessfully to remove Gerald Ford as the Republican candidate. In 1980 Ted Kennedy challenged Jimmy Carter at the Democratic convention. </p> <p>These days there is little of that kind of drama and instead the events tend to be meticulously choreographed and scripted showcases for the candidate. That is reflected in the fact that the major television networks will be carrying only an hour of live coverage in primetime each evening.</p> <p>But for Romney, this is a crucial moment. He and his campaign team have four days to counter the image created by a $120m Democratic ad onslaught over the summer portraying him as an ultra-rich businessman who made his fortune at Bain Capital off the backs of workers whose companies were closed.</p> <p>Norm Ornstein, an independent analyst at the American Enterprise Institute headquarters in Washington, said: \"The Obama campaign defined him before he had a chance to define himself\".</p> <p>After the convention, the only guaranteed primetime events will be the three presidential debates with Obama. Romney needs a good convention. </p> <p>Although he has been on the campaign trail constantly since January, polls show many Americans have only a hazy notion of his background and what he stands for. About 10% of Americans say they have no opinion of him at all. So expect lots of pictures of Romney with his family, wife Ann, and his five sons, five daughters-in-law and 18 grandchildren.</p> <p>Conscious of the image of Romney as aloof, the campaign team and the designers they have enlisted for the event say they have organised a schedule and put together a stage aimed at creating a sense of intimacy.</p> <p>Republican officials showed journalists around the convention centre earlier this week, the centrepiece of which is a $2.5m backdrop, 13 giant cubes, each with a large-screen. The convention theme is fairly anodyne: 'A Better Future'.</p> <p>Romney's campaign team, previewing the convention, said he will attempt to turn his time at Bain into a plus, portraying it as evidence of his credentials for running the economy. </p> <p>He will also confront another potential negative. Rather than downplay his Mormonism as he has in the past, a member of the Mormon Church will deliver the invocation on the day of his nomination speech and, as part of Romney's profile, his role as a bishop in the church will be highlighted.</p> <p>There are other areas of his life his advisers say he will fill in, including his four years as governor of Massachusetts, a period he tends not to talk about much, mainly because he introduced healthcare reforms similar to Obama's.</p> <p>Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Karl Rove, George W Bush's campaign strategist, said: \"The moment is coming when what each candidate says about himself and his plans is more important than what he says about his opponent.\"</p> <p>Romney's campaign team has organised a list of party luminaries whose main task is to talk up Romney. These speakers, along with expensively-shot videos to be broadcast throughout the week, have only one mission: to build up an alternative profile of Romney to the one the Obama campaign has been creating over the last few weeks.</p> <p>Ornstein emphasised the importance of Romney's speech, scheduled for Thursday night. \"He will have to hit the nerves that will get the convention excited but also reassure swing voters.\"</p> <p>\"It's going to be his first introduction to all the American people, so he's got to hit it out of the park,\" Craig Shirley, the conservative author, <a href=\"www.newsmax.com/US/romney-republican-convention-speech/2012/08/21/id/449301\">told Newsmax this week</a>. \"This has got to be a grand slam.\"</p> <p>Romney needs a repeat of the Republican convention in New Orleans in 1988 when George Bush Sr, with a reputation, like Romney, of being an uninspired speaker, was under similar pressure to perform. He did and, from trailing Michael Dukakis at the start of the convention, he went on to win the election, mainly on the back of a negative campaign.</p> <p>Ornstein cautioned against expecting much of a bounce, given the problems confronting him. \"He might get a little but not a significant bounce,\" he said.</p> <p>Part of the problem for the Republicans is that the Democratic convention follows, and then it will be Obama's turn for three days of primetime coverage and a potential Democratic bounce.</p> <p>An estimated 35,000 Republicans have signed up to attend the $120m convention. About 15,000 journalists have asked for credentials to cover it. On top of this there will be thousands of lobbyists who have paid for stands and will be throwing lavish parties. </p> <p>Outside, behind the barricades, police predict there will be about 15,000 protesters. Tampa police are being reinforced by officers from 57 other law enforcement agencies from round the state. ABC reported that police, given $50m by Congress to provide security, have spent $2.3m on close-circuit cameras, $5.9m in upgraded police radios and more than $790,000 for a fleet of new vehicles, including an armored truck.</p> <p>Apart from Romney, the convention speakers are made up of his former primary and caucus rivals such as Rick Santorum, who has one of the unfavourable early slots on Tuesday. </p> <p>One of Romney's most stubborn rivals, Ron Paul, is taking an army of supporters to the convention and could have created trouble, but party officials hope they have largely deflected trouble. </p> <p>The officials agreed on Thursday to an eccentric compromise, to include in a document representing official Republican policy one of Paul's main campaign themes, a promise to tie the dollar to gold.</p> <p>The opening day of the Republican convention is relatively low-key, with speeches by senator Rand Paul, South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, and, potentially the most entertaining, former governor Mike Huckabee. </p> <p>The dominant news of the day could be Romney formally passing the magic number of 1,144 delegates, the majority needed to make him the Republican presidential nominee. That would allow him to begin unleashing the millions of dollars he has been accumulating for the White House campaign.</p> <p>Ann Romney was scheduled to be the main speaker on Monday evening but, with the networks refusing to provide live primetime coverage that night, she may be moved to Tuesday night alongside Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor whose outspoken rhetoric makes him a party favourite even though he is at odds with them in lots of policy areas, including his support for some gun controls. </p> <p>On Wednesday, there is a strong warm-up team for the vice-presidential contender Paul Ryan. Among them is former presidential candidate John McCain, former Florida governor \u2013 and possible presidential contender in 2016 \u2013 Jeb Bush, former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty and former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice. </p> <p>One of the highlights in 2008 was whether Palin was capable to delivering a good speech: she was. There will not be the same concern about Ryan. Like Palin, he fires up the base: the question is whether, like Palin, he will alienate independents, and whether the media will exploit his policy differences with Romney.</p>",

Although Katz, the alias of Ojay Morgan, studied Shakespeare during a year in London as part of his course, Ima Read isn't actually a pro-literature anthem. It's about \"reading\": urban slang for letting someone have it, verbally, preferably in public. Katz, who does sound catty \u2013 albeit via a deep, dark baritone \u2013 is joined on the single by a female rapper, Njena Reddd Foxxx. Her presence serves to heighten the intensity of the impending diss and prove that, despite the prolific use in the lyric of the term \"bitch\", Katz, as he pointed out recently, isn't \"trying to be a misogynist\" \u2013 anyone can be a bitch, be they black, white, male, female, whatever.</p> <p>\"Impending\" is the operative word here, because actually the diss never comes. Ima Read is all about implied threat and the sense of menace you get from a slow, crawling buildup to annihilation. Over a super-minimal backing that makes <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZi_cW0bZJk\" title=\"\">Clipse</a> sound like Muse and allows every clipped consonant to be heard, Katz and Foxxx simply pile on the pressure as they recite a litany of warnings. Only once do they detail what that read will involve, which includes chopping, dicing, slicing and icing him/her/it. Apart from that, it's all talk. And they never say what said bitch has done to deserve the slaughter, although \u2013 so impressively do they contrive their warning via a series of education metaphors \u2013 one can only wonder in awe at how brutal it might be. That said, there would appear to be some metaphor mixing going on. Early in the track they're at school issuing threats about the read that will take place during \"first and second periods\"; by the end, they've moved to higher education and even a publishing house, rhyming \"cohesive\" and \"thesis\" and threatening to \"proof-read that bitch\".</p> <p>Ima Read is being released on Diplo's Mad Decent imprint Jeffrrees, and earlier this year was a hit at Paris fashion week, where it soundtracked Rick Owens' autumn/winter collection and allowed various models to shake on the catwalk. And if you think that sounds like we're implying it's going to be an I'm Too Sexy for Brooklyn's demimonde, you're right. Katz has already played as support to Lana Del Rey, and will be joining Azealia Banks for her UK dates later this year. And if you think that sounds like we're implying Ima Read is this year's 212, which saw Ms Banks threatening to, variously, \"eat ya food up, boo\" and \"bust your eight\", then you're right there as well. Ima Read, like 212, appears to be an anti-fashionista diatribe even as it becomes the cause celebre of those circles. It's very New York 1990. Very Vogue. Madonna will love it. Katz does have other tracks \u2013 Hey Ladies sounds like RuPaul rapping over Mantronix, and How Do You Feel? sounds like a gay Barry White rapping over Grace Jones' Slave to the Rhythm \u2013 but they feel like variations on a theme.

  "<p>With Syria's second city, Aleppo, consumed by violence, war has returned with a vengeance to its capital. But in Damascus, the regime, rather than rebel groups, is on the attack. The summer offensive that rebel leaders envisaged is, so far, not going to plan.</p> <p>Nationwide, the intensity of violence and number of dead and wounded is now at its highest level since the uprising began more than 18 months ago. Western officials, activists and rights groups estimate that close to 5,000 people have died during the past month alone. \"It was a good Ramadan for the regime,\" said one western official. \"If you can call 5,000 dead people good.\"</p> <p>In Aleppo, savage fighting along several front lines is claiming around 30-60 victims per day, including government soldiers. The city looks and feels abandoned. Most citizens who live in the rebel-held eastern half have either left, or have bunkered down in their homes, where few supplies are reaching them from regime-held areas to the south.</p> <p>Siege is crippling the opposition areas of the city. And a well-chronicled withering rain of shells from tanks and jets is wearing down both fighters and the few residents who have remained.</p> <p>As Aleppo has been burning, however, Damascus has also re-ignited, but with much less attention.</p> <p>The rebel insurrection in the capital, which struck fear into the heart of the regime from 18 July, with the killing of three security chiefs, was put down by loyalist forces around 10 days later, and does not at present appear to have lived up to expectations.</p> <p>The assault on the capital had led to large numbers of desertions and defections and sharply bolstered rebel morale in other areas of the country, especially in Aleppo where the charge was led by forces who had rapidly ousted loyalists from security bases in the hinterland.</p> <p>For the first time since the start of the uprising, the regime had appeared rattled. Its inner sanctum, watertight for four decades, started to creak and the number of defectors or deserters from Syria's 300,000-strong army is believed by Turkish and western observers to have topped 50,000.</p> <p>Since then attacks on rebel strongholds in Damascus have intensified and the opposition's capacity to counter them seems to have tapered off.</p> <p>\"We don't know what's going on in Damascus,\" said one rebel leader in Aleppo this week. \"All we know is that there's a big fight happening here.\"</p> <p>While rebel forces have shown more of an ability to co-ordinate operations \u2013 the summer offensive on the two leading cities is a case in point \u2013 they remain unable to make effective use of the officers who held command and control positions in the regime army and who have since sided with them.</p> <p>\"These officers cross the border into Turkey and then we don't see them again,\" said Sheikh Tawfiq Abu Sleiman, who commands a Free Syria Army unit in northern Aleppo. \"They never come back to the battlefield to join us. And even if they did, many people here would not accept them.\"</p> <p>Neither are defecting soldiers on the Aleppo battlefield being used as reinforcements. \"They go to Turkey,\" said Radwan Surmeidi, a rebel who had just received three regime defectors last weekend. \"They don't join us straight away. And maybe never.\"</p> <p>The rebel forces' inability to receive reinforcements is not helping them against a standing military that continues to outman and outgun them. Nor are new weapons coming their way, after the flush of guns and bombs taken in raids on regime depots abandoned by fleeing forces in late-July.</p> <p>A trickle of assault weapons and ammunition comes over the border from Turkey, with the help of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkish intelligence officials. However, the heavy weapons that rebel leaders have been calling for, especially anti-aircraft guns, have not arrived.</p> <p>The few anti-aircraft guns that opposition forces do have in Aleppo are strapped to the back of utility trucks. And there has to be a good reason to fire them. On Monday, as a Syrian air force helicopter lumbered into range over the suburb of Saif al-Dawli, one such gun truck was driven out from under a shed into the middle of an intersection.</p> <p>The gunner strapped to a seat let fire with a short burst, and the truck then retreated. \"We don't have the ammunition to fire any more,\" he said. The helicopter banked to the east and flew away.</p> <p>In Damascus, the lack of weapons to combat tanks and jets is also seriously limiting the rebel campaign. Even more troubling for opposition supporters, though, is the intensity of the regime assault on areas that had not long ago been considered rebel strongholds.</p> <p>\"Everyone is being arrested, or killed,\" a resident of the Damascus suburb of Midan told the Guardian. \"There was a time when the regime made a distinction between residents and gunmen. Now they treat everyone as one and the same.\"</p> <p>At least three areas of Damascus endured their 10th consecutive day of heavy shelling on Friday. The town of Zabadani to the west of the city was pounded by artillery and tanks for a 12th straight day. Rights groups reported several dozen bodies on Damascus streets on Friday, all of which seemed to be the product of executions.</p> <p>\"Assad wants a battle in Damascus now,\" said Wissam Tarif from the global campaigning group, <a href=\"http://www.avaaz.org/en/\" title=\"\">Avaaz</a>. \"They know that the FSA has been storing weapons in Damascus. The level of provocation is intensive. It has been non-stop for the past nine days day and night. They are killing people at checkpoints. They want the FSA to overstretch themselves. They want to test their resolve. The borders from Lebanon are completely locked down now so all the reinforcements need to come from the north.</p> <p>\"They have opened two battles and they think they have the FSA's measure.\"</p> <p>With fighting also continuing to rage in Syria's other cities of Homs, Hama, Idlib and Deir Azzor, the Syrian army too would appear to be at risk of overstretch.</p> <p>However, Aleppo and Damascus remain the key battlegrounds for both sides.</p> <p>\"When we win Aleppo we will go to Damascus,\" claimed the rebel leader Sheikh Tawfiq. \"And if they lose Damascus they can't send anyone else to fight us here.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Why-Orwell-Matters-Christopher-Hitchens/dp/0465030491\" title=\"\">Why Orwell Matters</a> is the title of a book published some years ago by my much-lamented if misguided friend <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/dec/16/christopher-hitchens-tributes\" title=\"\">Christopher Hitchens</a>. Whether Orwell matters, he clearly still fascinates, stimulates and enrages. How is it that a writer who died in 1950, at only 46, should be one of the most controversial figures of our own time?</p> <p>During the war he spent some years working for the BBC (\"wasting my own time and the public's money\", as he characteristically said), and the George Orwell Memorial Trust has proposed that a statue of perhaps the most famous employee in the corporation's history should be put up outside its new HQ. When Joan Bakewell brought this up with Mark Thompson, the outgoing director general, she was apparently told no, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/22/bbc-george-orwell-statue-left-wing\" title=\"\">the proposal was \"far too leftwing\"</a>.</p> <p>If Thompson thinks Orwell automatically counts as \"leftwing\" then he hasn't been following the story closely. It's true that Orwell said: \"Every line of serious work that I have written has been, directly or indirectly, <em>against</em> totalitarianism and <em>for</em> democratic socialism, as I understand it.\" But his posthumous fate was to be execrated by part of the left to which he thought he belonged while he was appropriated by a right he abhorred.</p> <p>Even to those of us who reckon ourselves Orwellians he remains a mystery. He was a great something, but a great what? His pre-war novels are good&#xa0;but not very good, and although Robert Harris has called Nineteen Eighty-Four <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/orwells-1984-sixty-years-on-1698619.html\" title=\"\">the most influential novel ever written</a>, Orwell wasn't a great novelist in the sense of George Eliot or Joyce. And various ditties he unwisely published make it clear that he was no poet either.</p> <p>When Bakewell calls him \"the greatest British journalist of his day\" it's something of a commonplace, but he was sometimes rather a bad journalist. During the second world war, Orwell contributed a \"London letter\" to Partisan Review, the radical US magazine. Most of us who write for a living might expect that if we filed a piece that began, \"There is very little political news\", or concluded, \"There are very few literary developments to report\", it would be spiked without much ado. As to his grasp of everyday politics, see him reporting in 1942 that Churchill would soon fall and be replaced by the towering figure of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Cripps\" title=\"\">Sir Stafford Cripps</a>.</p> <p>It's when he wanders from Westminster that he comes alive. When the \"special relationship\" is extolled, or the heroic wartime Anglo-American alliance, I think of Orwell recording the joke in London pubs that \"Chamberlain appeased Hitler but Churchill appeases America\". And by late 1943, it was \"difficult to go anywhere in London without having the feeling that Britain is now occupied territory. The general consensus of opinion seems to be that the only American soldiers with decent manners are the negroes.\"</p> <p>Orwell never went to university but despite \u2013 or because of \u2013 that he was a brilliant literary critic, whether on great writers such as Dickens or \"good bad\" books (as was Hitchens, as it happens).</p> <p>After his death his shroud was stolen and waved by militant US anti-communists whom he would have detested. Joseph McCarthy began his campaign of mendacious demagoguery only weeks after Orwell died, and yet not long before his death Orwell had specifically warned the Americans against fighting totalitarianism with totalitarian means.</p> <p>He attracted a fusillade of contempt from the quasi-Stalinist left, whether Raymond Williams, who said that Orwell \"created the conditions for defeat and despair\", or <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/RUSdeutscher.htm\" title=\"\">Isaac Deutscher</a>, who sneered at the \"Bogey-cum-scapegoat which Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four\" had created to frighten the masses. Without the energy to reopen those old feuds, one can confidently say that Orwell looks better today to anyone who had to live \"under socialism\" than do those who once denounced him for damaging the socialist cause by telling the truth.</p> <p>And every time you open Orwell, there is a flash of illumination, of acute contemporary value. Why is the EU in its present, possibly terminal crisis? Because \"India is potentially a nation\", Orwell wrote more than 65 years ago, \"as Europe, with its smaller population and great racial homogeneity, is not\", and all attempts since to make Europe \"a nation\" have been self-defeating.</p> <p>Why are Americans baffled by the refusal of Iraqis and Afghans to accept the US way as it offers progress and prosperity? In 1940, Orwell wrote: \"Hitler, because in his own joyless mind he feels it with exceptional strength, \u2026 knows that human beings don't only want comfort, safety, short working hours, hygiene, birth control and, in general, common sense; they also, at least intermittently, want struggle and self-sacrifice.\"</p> <p>So, yes, Orwell does matter, today as much as ever. He once wrote that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatole_France\" title=\"\">Anatole France</a> was not really a socialist but a radical, as could be seen quite simply in \"his passion for liberty and intellectual honesty\". Orwell must have known that he was writing about himself. Come to think of it, Thompson might be right, if for the wrong reason: there could not be a less appropriate site for a statue of Orwell than \"the Ministry of Truth\" \u2013 or the BBC, on which the ministry was partly modelled.</p>",

Harbottle &amp; Lewis had said there was no justification under English law to publish and that \"the only possible reason for publication of the photographs is one of prurience and nothing more\".</p> <p>Reaction to the Sun's decision was mixed: press freedom campaigners came out in support but some media lawyers branded it a cynical move designed to make money from increased sales.</p> <p>The Daily Mail demanded explanations about the royal protection officer who apparently watched while the game of strip pool was being played and was photographed by the young women who were at Harry's party.</p> <p>Public relations consultant Max Clifford said he received two calls \"within two or three hours of each other\" from two American women on Thursday who claimed to have more video and photographic evidence for sale. \"They said they have very interesting material and was I the same person who represented Simon Cowell and would I represent them? I said 'no'. There was a silence. I said I don't think it's right. It's an invasion of privacy,\" Clifford said.</p> <p>The photos used by the Sun and seen by millions around the world were first sold to the Los Angeles showbiz site TMZ and then syndicated internationally by celebrity news agency, Splash News which was charging British titles \u00a310,000 for the set of photos.</p> <p>The Sun's decision to publish amounted to a complete U-turn by the paper: 24 hours earlier it had acquiesced to Prince Charles's request not to proceed with publication on the grounds that it would be a breach of clause three of the PCC's code of practice, which says it is \"unacceptable\" to use photos of people shot in private places. Instead, it went ahead with a mock-up of the pictures using a naked picture of a 21-year-old female intern and the paper's picture editor.</p> <p>Rupert Murdoch's daughter Elisabeth defended the Sun's right to publish pictures of Prince Harry naked, saying on Friday it would be \"sad\" if newspapers could not print something that was so freely available on the internet.</p> <p>The decision to publish comes at a sensitive time for British newspapers which are facing the threat of statutory regulation from Leveson inquiry into media ethics.</p> <p>Sources at News International said the decision was not taken lightly, but there was a feeling that if they did not publish, \"a line would be drawn in the sand in the wrong place\" in terms of the boundaries for privacy claims.</p> <p>Media lawyer Mark Stephens said there was \"no public interest\" in publication and claimed the Sun had \"broken the law cynically, and obviously with a view to obtaining publicity\"\"</p> <p>Stephens said: \"He [Lord Justice Leveson] will be sitting there looking at what the Sun has done, and thinking, 'I'm going to have to regulate for the lowest common denominator, because I can't trust them to look after themselves'.\"</p> <p>But Padraig Reidy of Index on Censorship said the debacle showed that Leveson was having a chilling effect on press freedom: \"We are in a climate where editors are thinking twice about and it would be sad if this timidity became the dominant force in our press. I think the palace did send out a semi-threatening letter and this played into the hands of the papers and made it a press freedom issue.\"</p> <p>Louise Mensch, the Conservative MP for Corby, said there was a \"clear and demonstrable public interest\" in the photographs.</p> <p>There is no indication that other British newspapers will follow the Sun and publish the photos.</p> <p>The Daily Mirror said it decided not to publish because it felt \"it would be in clear breach of the PCC editors' code of practice regarding intrusion of privacy, which we signed up to\".</p>",
  "<p>Somerset are hoping to turn the tide of history as they go into Friends Life t20 finals day. Having lost five cup finals in the past two seasons, the county are in anxious need of something a little better. They have been beaten in the past three t20 finals, as well as the last two CB40s.</p> <p>As an essentially small but splendidly run and ambitious club, they have done well to be so consistently competitive in recent seasons. Brian Rose, now the director of cricket but captain when they won their first silverware, the 1979 Sunday League and Gillette Cup titles, says: \"It's been a fantastic achievement this year to get into a position where we could get into our fourth final of this competition in succession. People tend to forget that we did win it in 2005. But this is the fourth time in as many years where we're trying to win it again.\"</p> <p>Being a traditionalist, Rose, 62, would like to win the County Championship more than anything else, because this is something Somerset, who meet Hampshire in Cardiff on Saturday after Sussex play Yorkshire have never managed despite their long list of exotic players. That is why Rose spent as much time following the club's championship match against Sussex on Friday as he did preparing for Saturday's semi-final and \u2013 hopefully \u2013 final of the t20.</p> <p>\"It would mean everything to me, personally, to win the championship, but also for the club and its members. Having been in it for so long and got so close, including just two years ago.\"</p> <p>But on Saturday it is the game's shortest form that Somerset are concentrating on and in an attempt to change their luck they have altered their normal pattern of preparation. \"We've done things differently in the winter, thought about the process that we go through, thought about things that may help,\" Rose says. \"We've got a couple of specialist coaches who have come in and helped us. Chris Taylor from Gloucestershire is a real gun fielder and he's doing very well with the ECB in terms of coaching fielding. And he will be with us on finals day.</p> <p>\"Jimmy Cook [a long standing Taunton favourite, as player and coach] has been over with us for the past six weeks in terms of batting. And we're using a sport psychologist from time to time. Bringing in specialists occasionally is something I'm interested in persevering with, and we may look at our bowling in the same way.\"</p> <p>Somerset have made a profit in 20 out of the last 21 seasons, and although the championship remains the club's Holy Grail, the t20 has been a financial triumph for them. \"When we stage a Twenty20 match we sell out virtually ever time,\" says Rose. \"But to do that we've got to play attractive cricket.</p> <p>\"In the past few years we've had big performances from players like Marcus Trescothick, Craig Kieswetter or Kieron Pollard. But this year different players have chipped in with vital 30s.\"</p> <p>There could scarcely be a greater contrast between the loyal, traditional Rose and the big names in the Sussex side, who could be their final opponents. Scott Styris is a hired hand, a globe-trotting Twenty20 specialist who has given up all other cricket to concentrate on its shortest form. The 37-year-old Kiwi arrived in Taunton a couple of days ago to join up with the Sussex side and remind them \u2013 in case they had forgotten \u2013 about his vivid and violent century that won their quarter-final against Gloucestershire at Hove.</p> <p>He says: \"In the past 12 months alone I've played Twenty20 cricket in New Zealand for the Northern Districts, played in Bangladesh for the Select Royals, in India for the Chennai Super Kings in the IPL, in England for the Sussex Sharks and in Sri Lanka for the Kandurata Warriors. I'm also preparing to play in Tasmania for the Hobart Hurricanes in the Big Bash.</p> <p>\"It's the way the cricket world seems to be working. Unless you play for the big countries, like England, Australia or India, who are looked after well, the money in the Twenty20 world is better that you can get for playing international cricket.</p> <p>\"So I understand the position of players from West Indies, New Zealand and Sri Lanka. Their IPL money makes up 90% of their annual income.</p> <p>\"I've heard players in Sri Lanka say that they don't want to play Test cricket. Pakistanis say the same thing. They don't want to bowl 30 overs in a day for five days when they can earn 10 times as much bowling four overs. You have to seriously worry about that.\"</p> <p>Traditionalists like Rose do. But on Saturday everyone at Cardiff has only one game on their mind.</p>",
  "<p>It has been a difficult week for Becky John. First there was Republican congressman Todd Akin's suggestion that in cases of \"legitimate\" rape women rarely get pregnant because \"the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down\".</p> <p>Then George Galloway dismissed the act of having sex with a woman as she slept \u2013 one of the allegations made against Julian Assange \u2013 as nothing more than \"bad sexual etiquette\" if the pair had already had sex the night before. \"Not everybody needs to be asked prior to each insertion,\" the Respect MP said.</p> <p>John, who was raped at the age of 15 by a man whose home she had gone to voluntarily, has become used to hearing public figures reveal astonishing views about sexual violence; last year she was incensed when the justice secretary, Kenneth Clarke, talked about \"serious\" rape involving \"violence and an unwilling woman\". But she, frontline workers and academics in the field all say there is nothing unusual about the sentiments they express.</p> <p>\"It made me feel sick,\" John, now 36, says of her initial reaction to Galloway's comments. \"Like: 'Oh crap, here we are again.' The ideas society has about rape are staggering. Obviously people are not clear what it is and isn't, or we wouldn't be having these conversations.\"</p> <p>Research suggests she is right. In a poll of people in London carried out for the Havens, the capital's trio of flagship sexual assault referral centres, one in ten said they didn't believe it was rape if a man made his partner have sex when they didn't want to. Another 18% weren't sure.</p> <p>Rape within marriage became a crime in 1991. Yet crime figures show more than half of rapes are perpetrated by former or current partners, and prosecutors say convictions are far harder to secure in cases where the defendant and complainant have sexual history.</p> <p>\"There is still, in some areas, the feeling that a woman within an established relationship has a duty to accept sex,\" says an independent sexual violence advisor at Birmingham's Rape and Sexual Violence Project, speaking anonymously. We don't have lots of cases like that but I've definitely come across it.\"</p> <p>Galloway's suggestion that once you've had sex with someone once, you don't need to ask every time, plays out on jury panels too, lawyers say. \"The general public are very easily persuaded, I'm afraid, that in the context of a long-standing relationship there's a presumption of consent,\" says Miranda Moore QC, a barrister with wide experience of both prosecuting and defending rape cases.</p> <p>Jane Bickerstaff QC, a longtime specialist rape prosecutor, says: \"There's an element with juries where they think: 'I don't care, there's no harm done. They've had sex hundreds and hundreds of times before, why is public money being spent on this?'\"</p> <p>On Galloway's idea that waking a sleeping partner to ask for sex is not necessary if you've already had sex, the law is clear: he's wrong. The Sexual Offences Act 2003 clarified the law on rape, listing circumstances \u2013 including being asleep \u2013 where the consent and \"reasonable belief\" in it on the part of the perpetrator are presumed to be absent.</p> <p>In another survey for the Havens focusing on 18 to 25-year-olds, one in 20 men said they would try to have sex with someone if they thought that person was asleep. A total of 3% said they would assume consent if their partner was sleeping.</p> <p>Bickerstaff says she sees a surprising amount of cases where women say they woke up to find their boyfriend or husband having sex with them. \"It's much more frequent than you'd think,\" she says. \"You also get a surprising amount where they've been for a night out and got drunk and she will say: 'I just passed out on the bed, I didn't even bother to take my knickers off and the next think I knew I'd come round and he was having sex with me.'\"</p> <p>Misconceptions appear even greater among the young. In the second Havens survey only three quarters of men agreed that rape had been committed when one person has said no. Almost a fifth of those polled said they'd expect someone they'd had sex with before to do it again; among 18 and 19-year-olds, 17% had been pressured into sex because there had been previous sexual contact and 9% of young women had said no to sex but been ignored.</p> <p>There is disturbing evidence of how sex is viewed in the most extreme situations. Race on the Agenda's study on the effect of gang violence on young women and girls found that participants believed there were occasions where women gave up their rights to consent: if they had already had sex with two gang members, for example, they effectively had consented to sex with the wider group, and were referred to as \"battery chicks\".</p> <p>Such is the confusion among the public about what constitutes rape some women are unsure themselves whether they count as victims, says Lesley McMillan, a reader in sociology and criminology at Glasgow Caledonian University. She tracked a year's worth of rape cases reported to police in one area to find out why so many cases drop out of the criminal justice process before trial.</p> <p>One woman who had not reported her rape told McMillan: \"I wasn't really sure in my head what had happened, because we'd being going out for so long did I have the right to say no?\" The reported cases included incidents where women had been sleeping and were equally uncertain. McMillan says: \"Women would be saying things like: 'I had sex with him last night, is it OK for me to report this?' The police are very much trying to put forward the message that, yes, this is rape.\"</p> <p>Of the 408 cases she tracked, the vast majority \u2013 90% \u2013 were of women being raped by someone they knew. More than a quarter involved a man with whom they were either in a sexual relationship or had been previously, including boyfriends and husbands. These women were the group most likely to withdraw from the process: among the 105 women, 45% did so. Barely a tenth of the 105 cases ended up with charges being brought.</p> <p>\"Many women don't tell anyone at all about rape and it's largely because of fear about how people will treat them, and whether attitudes exactly like Galloway's will be part of it,\" McMillan says.</p> <p>\"His comments will work against efforts to encourage women to come forward who are unsure about how seriously something will be taken \u2013 for example in cases where people know each other, or where alcohol has been&#xa0;consumed.</p> <p>\"I also think there's a risk that for some men it may legitimate their behaviour. In the case files we worked with a lot of them were saying 'I had sex with her the night before, why shouldn't I do it again?' and not realising you should seek consent. It's almost like a presumed right of access.</p> <p>\"If you have that kind of message coming from an elected representative a lot of crucial work can be undermined.\"</p> <p>Bickerstaff fears Galloway's remarks won't help juries understand rape better either. \"There are most definitely preconceptions and prejudice among members of the public and unfortunately this sort of public ranting simply fuels those misconceptions and biases,\" she says.</p> <p>Other myths persist in the system: research by academics at the universities of Nottingham and Leeds using \"mock juries\" found jurors had a poor understanding of the ways women might react to rape, with many wrongly assuming they would fight back, have serious physical injuries, report the offence immediately or appear tearful and distressed when recounting their experiences in court.</p> <p>Guidance given to jurors about such issues by a judge or expert witness made them more likely to accept delay in reporting and a calm response under cross-examination, but they still expected women to have resisted strenuously and be injured as a result.</p> <p>\"The man who raped me repeatedly didn't have to hit me, or hold me down,\" Becky John says. \"He'd told me the area was so dangerous that if I left without him I'd get shot. I was terrified; I knew I didn't have a choice. The idea that if someone's not crying and screaming, it's not violent, or not rape, makes me so angry.</p> <p>\"I didn't call it rape when it happened because I didn't think it was. I thought rape was strangers with knives hiding in the dark. I now know that the majority of rapes are committed by people the victim knows. But a lot of people still don't, and these myths are perpetuated by people like Galloway.</p> <p>\"We need, sensibly and calmly, to just start saying 'no consent equals rape'.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Elisabeth and James Murdoch</h2> <p>Having <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/23/elisabeth-murdoch-mactaggart-lecture\" title=\"\">rounded on her brother James</a> for his \"pursuit of profit\" and \"absence of purpose\" at the Edinburgh International Television Festival yesterday, Elisabeth Murdoch broke her silence over the disagreement that has been rumbling on between the two siblings ever since the extent of the phone-hacking scandal at the News of the World became public knowledge last year. Elisabeth's speech certainly upped the attritional ante, but it is still far too early in the story to be certain their rivalry is genuine. For one thing, they are both Murdochs, and the Murdochs tend to be utterly calculating about their public utterances; for another, Elisabeth is married to Matthew Freud, the UK's most well connected and manipulative media PR. So if Elisabeth is slagging off James, then she's probably doing so for a reason. And that reason may be that James's career is finished in this country and the last remaining hope of a Murdoch retaining control of News International is for Elizabeth to pitch herself in opposition to the ancien regime.</p> <p><em>Sibling rivalry index: Watch this space... but for now only 2/5</em></p> <h2>Christopher and Peter Hitchens</h2> <p>Even though <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/16/christopher-hitchens-dies-aged-62\" title=\"\">Christopher died last year</a>, it's still almost impossible to separate the Hitchens brothers because it's their relationship with one another that was largely responsible for defining their public personas. And such was/is the size of both men's egos that their public personas were often of more interest to both men than their private ones. Their official estrangement dates back to 2001 when Peter, a devout believer in the existence of God who was increasingly veering into rightwing polemics, clashed with Christopher over communism and God. Their hostility grew ever more rabid, though there was some kind of rapprochement when Peter's third child was born and Christopher became terminally ill. However, as Christopher pointed out, \"There's no longer any official froideur, but there's no official \u2013 what's the word? - chaleur either\". What the two men did/do unquestionably share, though, was the absolute certainty that they were/are always right about everything.</p> <p><em>Sibling rivalry index: 3.5/5</em></p> <h2>David and Ed Miliband</h2> <p>Before Ed became leader of the Labour party in 2010, the only person aware of the fact there was any animosity between the two brothers was Ed. The country didn't know it and neither did David. Rather, it was generally assumed that David was the talented, intelligent, ambitious, photogenic \u2013 a marginal call this one, admittedly \u2013 brother who would go on to have the big career, while Ed was the nice but dim one who would bumble along through a series of junior political postings. All that changed when David underestimated the power of the trade unions and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/25/ed-miliband-wins-labour-leadership\" title=\"\">Ed got the top job</a>. Since then, while outwardly maintaining the air of a man who has no problem with his brother's preferment, he radiates sulkiness in his withdrawal from frontline politics. David is probably the only person in the Labour party disappointed by the coalition falling apart as his chances of taking Ed's job become slimmer by the day.</p> <p><em>Sibling rivalry index: 4/5</em></p> <h2>Noel and Liam Gallagher</h2> <p>Even if a whole generation hadn't taken far too many drugs in the 1990s and woken up believing that Oasis were the greatest rock'n'roll band in the world, then <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/jul/06/liam-noel-gallagher\" title=\"\">Liam and Noel Gallagher</a> would probably have found something to fall out about. Who had the thickest monobrow? Who was the least talented? That sort of thing. But at least it would have happened in private. As it is, the pair went on to make millions by recording albums that always sounded exactly the same and their rivalry was played out in public. The official cause of the row was one of them throwing a plum at another, but it could just as well have been about who nicked the last of the coke, who had their amp turned up the loudest or who could be photographed with the biggest celebs. The pair would probably get on a little better if they realised that 99% of the population hasn't a clue which one is Liam and which one Noel.</p> <p><em>Sibling rivalry index: 4.5/5</em></p> <h2>Alistair and Jonathan Brownlee</h2> <p>During the course of the Olympic triathlon this year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/07/olympic-triathlon-bronze-jonathan-brownlee\" title=\"\">Alistair and Jonathan Brownlee</a> completely rewrote the rules of sibling rivalry. When Jonathan was asked if he had known he had picked up a 15 second penalty, he replied that he had assumed it was his brother because only his brother could have been idiotic enough to do something like that. Similarly, having won the race, Alistair was himself totally unconcerned as his brother collapsed at the finish line, vomited a green liquid and had to be given oxygen. In the meantime, of course, the pair had hatched a plan that would allow Jonny to get a bronze medal despite the 15 second penalty. Here was sibling rivalry as it was always meant to be. Something noble, something pure. Not something to be hidden away or sublimated into poison. Needless to say the post-race interviewers had no idea of how to handle the unexpected candour of the Brownlee brothers, but for many of us those moments were one of the highlights of the Games.</p> <p><em>Sibling rivalry index: 5/5</em></p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/24/breivik-verdict-sane-21-years\" title=\"\">verdict delivered today</a> at the trial of mass murderer Anders Breivik shows that the Norwegian court has more sense than the Norwegian state. By declaring him sane and convicting him as a terrorist, they have hopefully paved the ground for a political understanding of those shocking events on 22 July last year.</p> <p>Contrary to what might be perceived outside Norway, this verdict is the strongest that could be passed down by the judicial system here and is in line with our common sense of justice in two ways. First of all, this verdict will not limit his imprisonment to 21 years. He will be kept imprisoned for as long as he is seen as a danger to society and thus it is very unlikely that Breivik will ever walk the streets of Norway again.</p> <p>Second, this verdict declares him responsible for his actions. This is significant. The major debate in Norway throughout the case has been about the initial psychiatric report and prosecution <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18530670\" title=\"\">calling for Breivik to be considered insane</a>. The bombing of government buildings and subsequent massacre at Ut\u00f8ya were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/24/anders-behring-breivik-profile-oslo\" title=\"\">planned for years</a>, and the murders done in cold blood. If Breivik was found criminally insane, it would be difficult to see how a Norwegian court could ever could find a terrorist of his kind responsible for their actions. It is therefore a relief to see that the question of insanity has been addressed.</p> <p>This verdict is also the end of a long trial process far too focused on Breivik's persona, and to little on the social and political climate that created him. By prosecuting on insanity, the state asked \"Who is Anders Behring Breivik\", and to answer that question every little piece of his personal history became important. But in a political and social context, this is an indifferent question. People such as Breivik have always existed.. But the actions they take and the way they are formed differs from society to society. The question is not who Breivik is, but why he became a rightwing extremist, an anti-feminist, anti-Marxist and a racist.</p> <p>During the court case, he sounded more and more like a traditional fascist or neo-nazi. His mistrust of democracy, his conservative, Christian views on family, gender and religion, his xenophobia and his belief in violent force could have been copied from any European country from the 1930s. These ideas appear to have been revived under the banner of a critique of Islam and \"anti-elitism\" around Europe over the last few decades, and Norway is no exception.</p> <p>If Breivik had been from Afghanistan, Iraq or Nigeria, we would have asked what it was within these countries and cultures that made him a terrorist. But during this trial, too few have asked about whether there is anything within Norway and its white upper class that produced Breivik.</p> <p>Norway has an image of itself as a place of no evil. This is the reason why it has been so difficult to face up to the political aspects of Breivik's terror. Blame has been siphoned on to an individual's psychology, the police and, in the end, the Norwegian government, but seemingly less on the political wave Breivik's ideas feed on. At the same time as the <a href=\"http://www.vg.no/\" title=\"\">largest Norwegian newspaper has called for the prime minister's resignation</a>, Breivik's ideological compatriots, such as the blogger \"Fjordman\" and the Norway Defence League find themselves having easier access to the media.</p> <p>Personally I would have no objection to Breivik being put to death in a public square for the atrocity of his crimes. But on the day of this verdict, I am also proud to live in a country where my want for revenge does not define the judicial system. Breivik has been sentenced in accordance with Norwegian law as it is, and in the end this law was also able to hold him responsible for his actions. Hopefully this verdict marks the end of the Breivik trial in Norway and the beginning of a process where we can instead examine our society and find out why he was created from within our midst.</p>",
  "<p>If you're a fan or keen student of human psychology, you're probably feeling spoiled for choice right now at the number of interesting reactions to a couple of shocking scandals (for a given value of \"scandal\"). There's the news that Lance Armstrong has received <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cycling/19365234\">a lifetime ban and been stripped of his Tour de France titles after not contesting accusations of doping</a>, and of course Prince Harry has been photographed naked in Las Vegas and some <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/08/24/the-sun-publishes-prince-harry-naked--in-vegas_n_1826768.html\">papers are going ahead and publishing the pictures, despite criticisms</a>.</p> <p>The stories are mirror images of each other. Both feature high-profile, high-status males being caught with their pants down (literally, in Harry's case) in a very public way. But Lance Armstrong's scandal involves an individual who supposedly earned his incredible success through hard work and determination but is alleged to have broken the rules and cheated to get ahead (he continues to protest his innocence). Prince Harry, on the other hand, is someone who was born into success and can't shake off the<a href=\"http://powerwall.msnbc.msn.com/business/10-reasons-why-prince-harry-is-the-cooler-than-his-bro-9729.gallery\"> idolisation of many members of the public</a> no matter how hard he tries. And he <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/4170083.stm\">has tried</a>. Both seem to be occupying two ends of the same spectrum.</p> <p>I don't follow any sport, so was confused by reading the news that \"Armstrong is to be stripped of his titles\". At first I thought this meant <a href=\"http://buzzaldrin.com/\">Buzz Aldrin </a>is now officially the first man on the moon, but have since checked the details. Whether you think Armstrong has been <a href=\"http://lancearmstrong.com/news-events/lance-armstrongs-statement-of-august-23-2012\">unfairly hounded by a vindictive organisation</a> or has cynically<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/aug/24/how-lance-armstrong-strongarmed-cycling\"> avoided facing up to his wrongdoings</a>, that's a matter for you, but I seriously doubt the truth is as binary as these possibilities suggest. </p> <p>I myself could take <a href=\"http://chemistry.about.com/od/medicalhealth/a/anabolicsteroid.htm\">steroids</a> or experience <a href=\"http://www.teachpe.com/drugs/doping.php\">blood doping</a>, but this wouldn't automatically sweep me to victory in the Tour de France. It would probably put me into such a hypeorxygenated <a href=\"http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-roid-rage.htm\">testosterone-fuelled rage</a> that I wouldn't be allowed to enter France at all. And all the steroids and doping you can handle won't cure you of<a href=\"http://www.nypcancerprevention.com/issue/11/cancer_prevention/feature/armstrong.shtml\"> advanced cancer</a>. To beat that and recover to the point where you repeatedly win an extremely challenging athletic contest is still an achievement, with or without chemical assistance. But, rules are rules. That's sort of the point of sport; if you're not going to follow them, why bother?</p> <p>Prince Harry, by contrast, has done nothing wrong, insofar as he's not broken any rules. To get naked among willing friends in a private hotel room is not against the law, no matter who you are. You could argue that as a royal and influential figure, he shouldn't do that sort of thing, but taking nude pictures of someone without their consent and selling them to the media is also something you shouldn't do, surely? He's also a young man in the armed forces. From stories I've heard about similar individuals, if this is the worst thing he gets up to when on holiday then we can count ourselves lucky.</p> <p>Both the Armstrong and Prince Harry stories have so many elements and occupy such diffuse areas of morality and acceptability that people's reactions to them are often more interesting, from a psychological perspective, than the stories themselves.</p> <p>Many people have been quick to condemn them. This could be because they feel let down and want to lash out. They may feel like those who behave badly deserve to be punished. A sense of justice is seemingly <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528753.400-an-appeal-for-fairness-in-society.html\">hardwired into humans </a>(and maybe even <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3116678.stm\">human-like creatures</a>), so individuals who appear to have achieved success through dubious means or have had it handed to them purely by accident of birth will frustrate our sense of fairness, and any opportunity to address this will be readily accepted. </p> <p>There's also envy to consider. Celebrities and high-profile figures seem to be exempt from the same rules around privacy and accountability that we extend to most normal people. Ken from the office fiddles his expenses? That's fine, we all do it. MPs do it? It's \"heads must roll\" time. This is arguably as it should be. People who aspire to positions of authority or trust should be held to higher standards, but this is regularly taken to ridiculous, invasive extremes when it comes to celebrities. The public loves a bit of schadenfreude, which could be seen as a way of saying \"How DARE this person be successful when I'm not! They should suffer for this.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-media-zone/200912/adam-lambert-and-tiger-woods-tale-two-american-idol-scandals\">psychological reactions </a>of the public to celebrity scandals and the manipulations of the media have been discussed many times before, but it's still a source of endless fascination for people like me. There are so many examples of psychological phenomena being splashed all over the news feeds and social networks by people oblivious to the fact that they are exhibiting them. For someone in the psychological disciplines it's like <a href=\"http://chemistry.about.com/cs/howthingswork/f/blblacklight.htm\">running a UV light</a> over a hotel bed (not necessarily Prince Harry's, his privacy has been compromised enough).</p> <p>Much of this comes from people needing a definitive way to conceptualise such ambiguous matters. The human brain <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/3966-ambiguity-messes-brains.html\">doesn't deal well with ambiguity</a>, that's why visual illusions like the<a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Necker_cube.svg/220px-Necker_cube.svg.png&amp;imgrefurl=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necker_cube&amp;h=198&amp;w=220&amp;sz=2&amp;tbnid=zhjlQFiOiRH7xM:&amp;tbnh=90&amp;tbnw=100&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=_\"> necker cube</a> or classic <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://www.blogcdn.com/www.switched.com/media/2008/09/facevase.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.switched.com/2008/09/17/top-25-optical-illusions-on-the-web-4&amp;h=254&amp;w=209&amp;sz=7&amp;tbnid=4XcuQc8udH11ZM:&amp;tbnh=90&amp;tbnw=74&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=__\">faces/candlestick</a> are either one or the other interpretation; the brain imposes structure on visually ambiguous images, but if there is more than one valid interpretation then it keeps changing between them. So when faced with uncertain scenarios, people may jump to a conclusion and stick to it before their minds get torn apart by uncertainty, like a robot encountering a logical paradox.</p> <p>You get to see a lot of <a href=\"http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/tetlock/Vita/Philip Tetlock/Phil Tetlock/1977-1983/1980 Attribution Bias On Inconclusiveness of Cognition Mo.pdf\">attribution bias</a> too. This is where people say other people are at fault for something that, if in the same situation, they would do themselves. We know our own minds, and we maintain a positive view of who we are and what we're capable of. If we don't, then we <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Depression/Pages/Introduction.aspx\">lose the ability to function normally</a>. But we can't know how other people's minds work, so we tend to assume they are personally at fault, when we would/can blame external factors for when something happens to us. For example someone saying \"I've gotten naked and acted like an arse when pissed, but that's because I was hammered and my mates were taking advantage of me. Harry is a prince though, he should know better, he's just a privileged idiot.\"</p> <p>My personal favourite is <a href=\"http://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive-dissonance.html\">cognitive dissonance</a>, which can often be seen at work on a large scale among media types. It's essentially a way of justifying your actions with the belief that you are right, even when the evidence doesn't support this claim. A perfect example is The Sun<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19365722\"> publishing the pictures of Prince Harry when nobody else would</a>, then coming up with a variety of bizarre explanations for why this was the right thing to do, other than, \"We'll shift more papers with pictures of a naked royal in them.\"</p> <p>A lot of people have wondered why The Sun is bothering with the whole \"our readers have a right to see them\" argument when the pictures are freely available online. </p> <p>I can offer no real explanation, alternatives or way to stop this sort of thing. It's just interesting from a scientific perspective. For psychologists, it can be like astronomers watching a meteor shower: you don't do anything about it, you just appreciate the spectacle for what it is, and it's all the more fascinating when you understand what's happening. <br><em><br>Witness the deranged ramblings of Dean Burnett's own mind on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/garwboy\">@garwboy</a></em></p>",

Bullfights mostly start at 6pm or 7pm, falling into children's viewing hours.</p> <p>Furious fans had accused the broadcaster of shunning a key part of Spanish popular culture. \"This means that TVE, which belongs to us all, will deprive us of something that over the centuries has formed part of the cultural patrimony of many Spaniards, both of the political right and the left,\" columnist Andr\u00e9s Amor\u00f3s wrote in the conservative daily ABC.</p> <p>But Rajoy's PP, which swept to power in November, is involved in a controversial reform of the broadcaster and is accused of removing senior journalists who are seen as too leftwing.</p> <p>The section preventing children from watching live bullfights was removed from its code of conduct earlier this year. \"Management has acted accordingly,\" a senior TVE source said.</p> <p>TVE had not banned bullfighting completely, and continued to cover it on late night television and radio programmes devoted exclusively to what fans consider to be an art form \u2013 newspapers cover it in their arts pages.</p> <p>Regular live broadcasts of the major bullfighting festivals from Madrid, Seville and elsewhere stopped in 2006, after TVE was priced out of the market by private broadcasters.</p> <p>\"Now the bullfighting lobby seems prepared to do anything in order to bring live fights back to our public television channel, even if that means trampling over European Union television rules,\" the Animalist party, which lobbies against bullfighting, said.</p> <p>TVE sources denied that any such rules were being broken.</p>",
  "<p>There's a fictional quality to the closeted environment of the Edinburgh International Book festival. For two weeks, Charlotte Square is fortified with a circle of portable buildings and Spiegeltents, creating a safe space for a fantasy of literary culture to flourish without undue interference from the outside world. It's a fantasy taking place in the daydreams of a seventysomething retired English lecturer, and The Book is its key signifier. The Book as object, as specks of ink splattered on decaying vegetable matter, tenaciously clinging to the bookshop shelf as the internet gushes forth its infinite flood of blogposts, status updates and indie-published ebooks.</p> <p>The science-fiction track within the EIBF programme came marked with the now standard disclaimers \u2026 it's not all rubbish, some of it actually has quite a lot of insight into that \"technology\" stuff of which we're all so terrified. It was rather like listening to a steam-train driver grudgingly admit that those jet-fighter pilots might be on to something. Neal Stephenson, one of the big names of SF attending this year's festival, has <a href=\"http://interviews.slashdot.org/story/04/10/20/1518217/neal-stephenson-responds-with-wit-and-humor\" title=\"\">written with some insight about the awkward experience of being patronised at literary events</a>, even when your books engage more readers in serious debate than most of the other attendees put together.</p> <p>But it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/china-mieville\" title=\"\">China Mi\u00e9ville</a> who took centre stage at this year's EIBF, first at a sold-out discussion of his young-adult novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fantasy/9780230765122/railsea\" title=\"\">Railsea</a> with fellow writer Patrick Ness, then at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/21/china-mieville-the-future-of-the-novel?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">a barnstorming polemic on the future of the novel</a>. Mi\u00e9ville arrived at the festival at the climax of an amazing five-year period, during which he has gone from a cult writer of baroque urban fantasy to arguably one of the most influential writers in any genre in the UK. His dual identity as radical Marxist academic and fantasy novelist, his absolute love of geek culture combined with a true respect for literary traditions, his unchallenged status as the writer with <a href=\"http://couldtheybeatupchinamieville.wordpress.com/who-is-china/\" title=\"\">\"the best guns in literatur\"</a> and, of course, a run of superbly idiosyncratic SF masterpieces \u2013 including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780330493109/the-city-and-the-city\" title=\"\">The City and the City</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/science-fiction/9780230750760/embassytown\" title=\"\">Embassytown</a> \u2013 have propelled him to unusual levels of fame.</p> <p>Queried by Ness on the importance of genre in his writing, Mi\u00e9ville replied that he prefers to think of genre as a literary tradition. It's a minority viewpoint even within SF, where commercial pressures often push writers toward strict generic criteria, a pressure Mi\u00e9ville has clearly succeeded in resisting. But it's the only perspective that really makes sense of SF's growing cultural significance. Through the 20th century, it evolved as a literary tradition in continuous dialogue with the most significant forces shaping that century: science and technology. Now, in the early 21st century, SF provides writers with a rich set of ideas and metaphors to explore the incredible complexity of the modern era. Mi\u00e9ville's fiction is in continual dialogue with the SF tradition, recycling and reshaping it as a vehicle for his own philosophy and beliefs.</p> <p>The impact of technology was the subject of Mi\u00e9ville's address on the future of the novel. It's a discussion that, within the publishing industry at least, tends to be distorted by that deeply conservative question: \"How do we all keep making a living from this thing?\" Mi\u00e9ville presented the counter-argument: how does anyone make a living from anything in our neo-liberal economy? The very same neo-liberal economic model that advocates of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6337781.stm\" title=\"\">DRM</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jun/26/ofcom-outlines-anti-piracy-rules\" title=\"\">anti-piracy legislation</a> are so keen to protect. As Mi\u00e9ville so aptly concludes, if we're going to arrive at a new economic model that rewards human creativity and ingenuity, we're going to have to think deeply and radically about how we reshape our entire society. If any literary tradition is adapted to lead that discussion, it is science fiction.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> Morning. If you had said, at the start of 2012, that a switch from Test cricket to ODIs would increase England's chances of victory, you'd have been the recipient of the kind of disdainful look usually reserved for those who suggest that the Sopranos clearly borrows a number of dramatic techniques from Doogie Howser MD and that only ignoramuses fail to appreciate that Jedward must be celebrated as the quintessence of the creative freedoms afforded by a postmodern society. Yet that's how things seem at the moment. In 2012 England have won three out of 11 Tests, and 10 out of 10 one-day internationals </p> <p>Only five sides in history \u2013 none of them English \u2013 <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/126874.html\">have ever had a better run</a> in this form of the game. England are top off the ICC Rankings too, for the first time since 1995, although South Africa will usurp them for the second time in a week if they win today. (Unlike in the Test Championship, the rankings change after each game rather than each series.) The upcoming three-match T20 series will also determine who is top of the T20 Championship.</p> <p>I don't know about you but I'm slightly No1ed out, and not just because of the continence issues. These days every England game seems to be conducted with one eye on the top of the bloody ICC Rankings. We've almost forgotten that winning matches and winning series are a joyous end in themselves. Being good was fun for a while, but we're in too deep now. There's too much stress. I want out.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>The forecast in Cardiff</strong> is dreadful. Ah. Mind you, it's not raining <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYwMZs6eSqo\">yet</a>.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>South Africa have won the toss and will bowl first</strong> They include five of the XI from the final Test at Lord's; England have six. Stuart Broad have been rested for this series, so Chris Woakes makes his first appearance since last August. There's no room in the side for Jonny Bairstow, at least not yet. With no Andrew Strauss, the composer quota is filled by the South African debutant Dean Elgar.</p> <p><strong>England</strong> Cook (c), Bell, Trott, Bopara, Morgan, Kieswetter (wk), Bresnan, Woakes, Swann, Anderson, Finn.</p> <p><strong>South Africa</strong> Amla, Smith, Elgar, de Villiers (c/wk), Duminy, du Plessis, McLaren, Parnell, Peterson, M Morkel, Tsotsobe.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>In a surprising development</strong>, the covers are on, and not for aesthetic purposes.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Something to talk about given that there is bugger all chance of a completed match today</strong> We haven't had enough misanthropy on the OBO of late, so let's address that with one simple recycled riff: what would you put in Room 101 and why?</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>10.36am</strong> The covers are still on. A woman in the crowd is hiding under a hoodie, reading Fifty Shades of Grey. What would Fred Trueman make of that?</p> <p>Has anyone actually read that thing? Is the whole world apart from me now having great lovin' as a result? IS SOMETHING BRILLIANT HAPPENING?</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>10.40am</strong> \"Re Room 101 entries,\" says John Collins. \"Corporate sponsored sixes and trumpeting. Hell, while we're at it can we just put Ravi Shastri in there too?\"</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>10.54am</strong> \"I'd like to consign rain that falls in daylight hours between April and the end of September to Room 101,\" says Paul Frame. \"Surely we can all agree that rain is great, but that it should only fall between 9pm and 6am during the summer?\"</p> <p>Agreed. This whole summer has been like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ham4zUM8pyc\">one long John Cusack film</a>. Which is a very good thing in theory, but not when you are being drenched every second of the day.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>10.59am</strong> \"Rolling back to 1995, when we ruled the world, <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/65016.html\">check out this knock from Athers</a>,\" says Elliot Carr-Barnsley. \"It had a SIX in it! In today's cricketing world he would've been called boom-boom Athers. Well, it was rapid for him. A victory helped in no small part by what must have been a truly horrible innings from Carl Hooper.\"</p> <p>That was a magnificent innings, in a series decider as well. I think he took 27 balls to get off the mark, with Ambrose and Bishop seaming it square on a wet pitch, and then went through the gears. I've got a feeling the six was over extra cover. Atherton was an underrated one-day opener.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>11.05am</strong> Sky are showing highlights of the last ODI between these sides, a low-scoring thriller at the last World Cup. If you are very, very, very, very, very, very, <em>very</em> bored, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/mar/06/england-v-south-africa-live-cricket-world-cup\">here's the OBO of that game</a>.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>11.15am</strong> \"Athers' six,\" says Douglas Campbell. \"Hooked high onto Mound Stand?\" You might be right, my memory is a little addled. Let me check the Guardian archive.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>11.18am</strong> Douglas Campbell 1-0 Rob Smyth. The archive tells us that Atherton \"pulled Bishop high over square leg for six, a shot reminiscent of the great Rob Smyth in his pomp\".</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>11.20am</strong> \"Room 101?\" says Richard Hudson. \"I'd put WH Smith's policy of always trying to flog me a bar of chocolate every time I go to the till...\"</p> <p>This is precisely the kind of petty gripe I would be happy to call my own. More of this kind of thing please!</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>11.23am</strong> \"Please insert fifty shades of everything into room 101,\" says Phil Withall. \"No that's not a euphemism, but the ability of sub-editors to use it in everything from politics to gardening to hair colour, great in-joke chaps.

Nobody disrespects the Strauss on my watch.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>11.55am</strong> \"I'd put people who swing their arms while they walk into Room 101,\" says Susan Perry. \"It's not like it has a tangible effect on propulsion. Grrrr.\"</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>11.56am</strong> This is the best email so far, from Dave Pople. \"When I'm paying for petrol by card, the assistant says 'If you'll enter your card'... then 'If you'll enter your number'... then I desperately try to remove it before she (usually a she) says 'if you'll take your card' \u2013 but she says it anyway. What does it even mean? Why make it conditional? I then say thank you and she says 'no problem'. It had better not be an effing problem. Blood boiling, I leave.\"</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>12.07pm</strong> Play will start at <strong>12.45pm</strong> if there is no further rain. Play may not start at 12.45pm. If we do start then, the match will be 38 overs per side.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>12.12pm</strong> Be honest: how many of you were whooshed when you <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=a+touch+of+cloth\">first saw that A Touch of Cloth trailer</a>. It does seem like a fair few people were whooshed. I blame KP.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>12.17pm</strong> \"When exactly did Andrew Strauss morph from universally admired, level headed, dignified and down to earth chap into petulant, spoilt, monarch child dismissing people from his presence because of his own jealousy &amp; Machiavellian games,\" says Rory Taylor. \"When we lost a couple of games perchance?\" I blame KP.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>12.40pm</strong> We won't be starting at 12.45pm.</p> <blockquote> <p>Here comes the rain again<br>Falling on my head like a memory<br>Falling on my head like a new emotion<br>I want to walk in the open wind<br>I want to talk like lovers do<br>I want to dive into your ocean<br>Is it raining with you </p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>12.42pm</strong> \"Room 101,\" says Daniel Maxwell. \"How about putting in telephone helpdesk people who, after satisfying the most simple query, and despite the finality of your closing tones, insist on asking 'Is there anything else I can help you with sir?'.\"</p> <p>When they do that you should just hit them with a list of problems. \"Well the cream the doctor gave me isn't really working.

Just thought you and/or Susan Perry should know.\" I knew it would be worth coming into work today.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>12.50pm</strong> The latest plan is to start play at 1.15pm.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>12.59pm</strong> Play is not going to start 1.15pm.

It's not like we actually give a monkeys about the caller or their problems, I'm currently typing this, listening to my iPod in one ear while listening to some poor sod whine about lost emails in the other. A chat about his personal problems would be a godsend rather than take the next call from some muppet who can't drag and drop. There I said it \u2013 I feel better.\"</p> <p>I don't know about you, but in terms of disappointment this is right up there with finding out the truth and Santa, the tooth fairy and Leland Palmer.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>1.13pm</strong> In case you missed it earlier in the week, <a href=\"http://www.skysports.com/video/inline/0,,12607_8003627,00.html\">this video of Bumble and Nasser having a go at umpiring is fantastic</a>.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>1.20pm</strong> \"When Miv (1.01pm) says (s)he works at an IT help desk, do they mean that one that keeps calling me up to fix a problem they've discovered on my computer by guiding me through the downloading of not-at-all-suspicious software?\" says Matt Dony. \"They keep trying, but if anything, my computers got more problems than ever. AND my bank account seems empty. Strange...\"</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>1.23pm</strong> This is a sensational discovery from my colleague James Dart. It seems YouTube has a Moodwall, whereby you can search videos by 'vibe'. Seriously. <a href=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/24/1345810786503/Picture_174.png\">There are a number of vibes, including 'creative', 'powerful', 'epic' and 'gross'</a>. 'Despairing for the future of humanity' is not yet an option, though.</p> <p>Maybe we should offer a selection of vibe-based OBOs for each game.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>1.26pm</strong> The umpires have inspected again, and play is (probably not) going to start at 1.45pm.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>1.30pm</strong> Guess what? Yep. We have around two hours to start the game. Mystic Bob has just the slightest hunch it won't happen.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>1.39pm</strong> \"<a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/india-v-new-zealand-2012/engine/current/match/565817.html\">I see in sunny India, that New Zealand are 106 for five</a>,\" says Steven Pye. \"All five wickets have fallen to the spin of Ojha and Ashwin. Just as well that England play spin so well, otherwise I'd be worried about our forthcoming tour\u2026..oh.\" That's going to be a laugh riot for those of us getting up at 4am, isn't it.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>1.42pm</strong> Another cracking discovery from James Dart. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9G-uMapNAs\">Graham Thorpe's two international wickets</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtCAP2h5_U0\">Mike Atherton's two international wickets</a>.

It's a modern miracle.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>0.0 overs of 24: England 1-0 (Cook 0, Bell 0)</strong> They've gone off after one ball! One ball, done one. Only in cricket. Morne Morkel bowled a single ball \u2013 a leg-side wide \u2013 and then the umpires took the players off again. Apparently the rain is not especially heavy, so <strike> this sorry farce isn't over just yet </strike> there's still a chance we might get some play.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>3.02pm</strong> \"If this doesn't get an OBOer breakdown, then I'll eat my hat...\" says Peter Harmer.

Yes, yes they really did see some play at the Swalec Stadium on 24 August 2012. It's a Twentythree23 game, which means an unusual role for Cook, Bell and Trott. Cook plays defensively for most of Morkel's first over, which brings no runs off the bat.</p> <p>\"Room 101? Pies without bottoms,\" says Jo Beasley. \"Apart from fish based products, cottage or shepherds - pies should be surrounded in pastry. A bowl of thick stew with a measly lid is not a pie, it's know in my circle of (not at all sad) friends as a 'lie pie'.\" I wanna be in your gang.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>2nd over of 23: England 2-0 (Cook 0, Bell 1)</strong> The left-arm seamer Lonwabo Tsotsobe, who is No1 in the ICC ODI bowling rankings, will start from the other end. The crouching Bell misses an attempted cut at a pretty wide delivery angled across him, and then he fiddles the first run off the bat from the tenth delivery. A great start from England, who are on course for a score of 23 for none from 23 overs.</p> <p>\"Being accosted on the pavement by grinning strangers with their clipboards and their charity signs, trying to get me to set up a direct debit, like it'll just be the best wheeze in the world,\" says Jonathan Wood who, in a reversal of the norm, <em>likes</em> to talk about the charity work he <em>doesn't</em> do. \"I'm sorry, you're not half as interesting as you think you are, you're trying to stop me getting where I want to go, and I'm British so I really, really just want to be left alone.\"</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>3rd over of 23: England 4-0 (Cook 1, Bell 2)</strong> England are motoring now, and Bell takes a quick single to mid on to make the score 3-0 from 2.3 overs. Cook then takes a ridiculous single to mid off and would have been out by a mile had Parnell not whizzed his throw like an eejit, miles wide of the stumps at the bowler's end. \"One of the great England Powerplays you're watching here...\" says Andy Bull to my right. England's scoring rate is an epiphany-inducing 1.33 runs per over.</p> <p>\"The difficulty of buying 500ml bottles of water makes me irrationally angry,\" says Richard Mansell. \"Unless one searches diligently all one can get are 750ml bottles, which have a real cost of only slightly more than the 500ml bottles, but are charged at a much higher price (thus their prevalence). The money doesn't annoy me, though \u2013 it's the difficulty of squeezing them into the tiny little elasticised pockets behind airline seats into which we have to cram our necessaries.\" Are you sure you're not in the Truman Show and the subject of a cunning scheme designed to make you lose it? I've never had a problem finding 500ml bottles, ever.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>4th over of 23: England 16-0 (Cook 8, Bell 7)</strong> Cook pings Tsotsobe through the covers for the first boundary of the innings, and then slices three more past point. Bell continues a generation-defining over by drilling a lovely boundary over mid off. Twelve from the over.</p> <p>\"Murray's Meltdown was in 2003,\" says Andrew Goldsby. \"9 years? 9 YEARS? OBO just made me feel old. Very very old.\" How did you think we feel? <a href=\"http://independent.columnists.ie/files/2011/12/Donegal-Man-Weather-beaten.jpg\">Look what 10 years of OBOing and MBMing did to Scott Murray</a>.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>5th over of 23: England 32-0 (Cook 9, Bell 22)</strong> What a storming shot from Ian Ronald Bell! He walks down the track to Morkel's first ball and pulls it sweetly over midwicket for six. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlxGNnDZKkk\">That was a bit like John Davison in the 2003 World Cup</a>, a sweet roundhouse blow over the ropes. He gets another six later in the over, and if anything this one was even better, a delicious on-the-run drive over long off. Sixteen from the last Powerplay over.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>RAIN STOPS PLAY. 5.3 overs of 23: England 37-0 (Cook 10, Bell 26)</strong> Yep. It's hootering down, so that might be it for the day. They need to be back on by around 4pm. It's currently 3.32.08.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>3.38pm</strong> It's not going to happen. Go home. Get out of here!</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>3.40pm</strong> \"Room 101,\" says William Hardy. \"People who don't start bagging their shopping until after they've paid.

England have beaten South Africa by 37 runs! That's how this works, right? Ah. Okay, the match has been abandoned due to rain, so it's 0-0 with four matches to play.

Black Watch at the Drill Hall. Medea with the chariot flying off into the Edinburgh sky at the end. The Tempest on oil drums at the Quad, Coriolanus with soldiers strutting between the colonnades there (liking that venue!). Down at St Stephen's when it was Aurora Nova, so many wonderful shows \u2013 Song of the Goat, Do Theatre, the Marionette's Battle of Stalingrad (tiny scale for something so huge and it worked). Looking forward to seeing the space used again \u2013 well done, Northern Stage. The Traverse \u2013 Gargarin Way, Prudencia Hart, Ontroerend Goed's in your face 'Once and for all, we're gonna to tell you who we we are so shut up and listen! (also award for longest title).' So many shows there over the years, both at the new and old building down in West Bow \u2013 images remain though some of the titles have gone. And Polish shows from Richard Demarco. The old Cafe Graffiti. Fantastic memories.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17562575\">Senton offered</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The first production of John Clifford's In\u00e9s de Castro at the old Traverse; The Three Bonazzi, a clown show directed by Jos Houben; my first exposure to Derevo with Harlekin at Pleasance, and again with Ketzal at St Stephen's (still digesting Mephisto Waltz); an extraordinary sketch show called Universal Grinding Wheel; Licedei's The Family.</p> </blockquote> <p>Next year, I will have been coming to the fringe for 30 years, so over the next 12 months I'll be trawling my own memories to come up with the list of memorable shows.

  "<p><strong>(updated below - Update II [Sat.] - Update II [Sun.])</strong></p> <p>The New Statesman owes its readers a correction for a clear and crucial falsehood contained in <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/david-allen-green/2012/08/five-legal-myths-about-assange-extradition\">this much-cited argument</a> by its legal correspondent, David Allen Green. As I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/22/julian-assange-media-contempt\">noted on Wednesday</a>, Green purported to debunk what he called \"common misconceptions\" and \"myths\" being spread by supporters of Ecuador's asylum decision in the Assange case, but in doing so, he propagated his own myth on <em>the key question</em> in this matter. By doing so, he misled large numbers of readers not only at the New Statesman but in many other venues which cited his claims. Regardless of one's views on the asylum matter, nobody should want clear errors on the central issues to be left standing in major media outlets.</p> <p>The falsehood here is clear and straightforward. One of the \"myths\" Green purported to debunk was that \"Sweden should guarantee that there be no extradition to USA.\" Assange's lawyers, along with Ecuadorean officials, have repeatedly told Sweden and Britain that Assange would immediately travel to Stockholm to face these allegations if some type of satisfactory assurance against extradition to the US could be given. This is the paramount issue because it shows that it is not Assange and Ecuadorean officials \u2013 but rather the Swedish and British governments \u2013 who are preventing the sex assault allegations from being fairly and legally resolved as they should be. </p> <p>But Green claimed that \"[i]t would not be legally possible for Swedish government to give any guarantee about a future extradition, and nor would it have any binding effect on the Swedish legal system in the event of a future extradition request.\" He said that this is so in part because \"any final word on an extradition would (quite properly) be with an independent Swedish court, and not the government giving the purported 'guarantee'.\" He then cited a British lawyer (notably, not a Swedish one) who <a href=\"http://www.firmmagazine.com/features/1179/Assange_-_what%27s_going_on%3F.html\">made the same claim</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[I]t appears that if the extradition is contested as it would be in Assange's case then it is a matter for the court not the government to decide if he is extradited.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This is completely and unquestionably false. It is simply untrue that it is Swedish courts, rather than the Swedish government, who are the final decision-makers in extradition requests. It is equally untrue that the Swedish government has no final decision-making power regarding extradition requests that are legally sanctioned by the Swedish judiciary. These are not matters for reasonable debate. The law is clear. Green's claim is false.</p> <p>Last night, international law professor <a href=\"http://www.law.unimelb.edu.au/melbourne-law-school/community/our-staff/staff-profile/username/Kevin%20Jon%20Heller\">Kevin Jon Heller at Melbourne Law School</a> emailed me and wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[I]t is incorrect to say that the final decision to extradite Assange from Sweden to the US would be made by the courts.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>He directed me to <a href=\"http://klamberg.blogspot.se/2012/08/extradition-of-assange-to-us-via-sweden.html\">this analysis</a> from Mark Klamberg \u2013 a professor of international law at the University of Stockholm \u2013 who dissects Sweden's extradition law and makes Green's error as clear as it can be [my emphasis]:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"How does procedure work if somebody is to extradited from Sweden? \u2026 [I]f the person referred to in the request has not consented to being extradited, the case shall be tried by the supreme court. Section 20(1) provides that if the supreme court has considered that there is a legal obstacle to extradition the request may not be granted.</p> <p><em>\"Even if the supreme court has found that there are no obstacles, the government can refuse extradition.</em> This is because section 1(1) provides that if certain conditions are fulfilled, a person 'may' not 'shall' be extradited. In other words, even if the prosecutor-general and the supreme court finds that all conditions for extradition are fulfilled<em> the government may veto such extradition.</em> It does not work in the reverse way, the government can not grant extradition if the supreme court has found that any of the required conditions are lacking.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>Let's repeat that: \"Even if the supreme court has found that there are no obstacles, the government can refuse extradition.\" And: \"Even if the prosecutor-general and the supreme court finds that all conditions for extradition are fulfilled the government may veto such extradition.\" In other words, under clear Swedish law, the Swedish government has exactly the final decision-making authority over extradition that Green told his readers it lacks. </p> <p>Professor Klamberg is far from alone in making this clear. As I noted on Wednesday, <a href=\"http://ibnkafkasobiterdicta.wordpress.com/2012/08/19/the-julian-assange-circus-why-is-carl-bildt-lying/\">this Swedish-Moroccon lawyer analyzed</a> Swedish extradition law in rigorous detail to make the same point:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Swedish extradition law clearly states that the Swedish government is the body deciding on any extradition request.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Moreover:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"No provision gives any court the right to decide on an extraditions request.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The court's role in extradition requests is limited to this situation:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The government may not extradite someone for whom the supreme court has found that an extradition would not be in conformity with the law.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>As I noted on Wednesday, his analysis of the law (exactly like Professor Klamberg's) shows there are two possible outcomes once the contested extradition request goes to the Swedish court: first, the court rules the extradition request is not cognizable under relevant law, in which case the Swedish government is barred from extraditing; or second, the court rules the extradition request is cognizable under relevant law, <em>in which case the Swedish government has the option not to extradite</em>. As he put it:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The deciding body is thus the government, with an input by the prosecutor general.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Swedish extradition law is written to ensure that if an extradition is to occur, Swedish government officials, not its courts, are the final decision-makers on whether that should take place.</p> <p>More clear evidence of Green's error, first noted by <a href=\"http://pastehtml.com/view/c91yw7wjy.html\">this superb debunking of Green</a>, comes from <a href=\"http://www.dfat.gov.au/foi/downloads/dfat-foi-1112-F264.pdf\">documents sent by the Australian diplomatic mission in Sweden</a> to its home government on the Assange/extradition matter (they were declassified and released to the public by the Australian government). In response to questions from Canberra about what an extradition request to Sweden would entail, the Australian diplomatic mission explained:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The process require[s] a request from another state, a decision by Sweden's supreme court on whether extradition was possible, and <em>finally a decision by government to go forward with the extradition.</em>\" [my emphasis; p61]</p> </blockquote> <p>The internal communications in the Australian government go on to note:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The Swedish government could deny an extradition or temporary surrender that the supreme court had approved, but if the supreme court denied an extradition or temporary surrender application, then the matter ended there; ie, the government could not approve a process that the supreme court had rejected.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Again: the Swedish courts simply decide whether extradition is legally possible, but the final decision as to whether to extradite is vested in the Swedish government.</p> <p>This is not some sort of strange or exotic feature of Swedish law. As Professor Heller wrote when explaining that the Swedish government possesses exactly the final decision-making authority Green denied it has:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Nor is that unusual; I don't know of any states that give the final decision to courts instead of to the executive.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In light of this abundant evidence, I trust that even the most hardened Assange critic will acknowledge that Green was radically wrong on this key point. It should be noted that those sources I just cited are not Assange supporters, but rather are the opposite: they are all, to varying degrees, hostile to his fight against extradition to Sweden. Professor Klamberg (<a href=\"http://opiniojuris.org/2012/08/22/klamberg-on-extraditing-assange-from-sweden-to-the-u-s/\">along with Professor Heller</a>) is highly skeptical that Sweden would extradite Assange to the US. The Swedish-Moroccon lawyer I cited began his analysis by declaring:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"First, let me state that I am as adamantly in favour of Julian Assange being extradited to Sweden as I am opposed to him being extradited to the USA for any WikiLeaks-related offense.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And the Australian government has been infamously unsupportive of the rights of its citizen. But they nonetheless all make crystal clear that Green's statement about the Swedish government lacking the power to decide extradition is factually false. </p> <p>It is inconceivable that the New Statesman would allow such a flagrant error on this key issue to remain unretracted, particularly since it was offered under the guise of Green's legal expertise. Indeed, when replying to Green on Wednesday, I myself assumed that there must be some reasonable basis to his claim about the lack of authority on the part of the Swedish government over extradition requests, and thus too readily vested his claim with credibility: a mistake I immediately corrected with updates upon learning that his claim was false. The New Statesman has the absolute journalistic obligation to prominently correct this error.</p> <p>It may be true that there are <em>other independent reasons</em> to argue that Sweden should not offer Assange the assurance against extradition that he seeks. One may contend, for instance, that Sweden should, or even must, wait until it receives an extradition request and its courts rule on its legality before it can make a determination as to whether it will comply. That is an argument Green makes. Professor Klamberg notes there \"is nothing in the extradition of criminal offences act that deals with this scenario, but it would depart from established practice.\"</p> <p>I happen not to find that objection valid. At the very least, one can imagine all sorts of ways that Sweden, Ecuador and Assange's lawyers could negotiate a resolution that provides Assange with meaningful protections against his fear of extradition to the US while following standard procedure on extraditions. Swedish authorities could, for instance, publicly state that they view espionage charges for the \"crime\" of reporting on government secrets to be a \"political crime\" not subject to extradition, but still reserve the right to formally decide upon any extradition request if and when they receive one. In the last four paragraphs of his analysis, <a href=\"http://ibnkafkasobiterdicta.wordpress.com/2012/08/19/the-julian-assange-circus-why-is-carl-bildt-lying/\">this lawyer</a> <strong><em>[link fixed]</em></strong> lays out exactly how such a deal could be reached consistent with Swedish law. If there were any real desire to find a resolution, one could be found. It is Sweden's steadfast refusal even to negotiate these matters that led the Ecuadoreans to be suspicious of their motives and to conclude that asylum was necessary here to protect Assange from political prosecution.</p> <p>But all of that is a completely separate issue from the glaring error in Green's post about whether it is the Swedish government or its courts that have final decision-making authority. The fact that Green made other arguments in support of his ultimate conclusion does not remotely mitigate his false claim that \"any final word on an extradition would (quite properly) be with an independent Swedish court, and not the government giving the purported 'guarantee'.\" Nor does it relieve the New Statesman of the obligation to prominently correct this error.</p> <p>I'm certainly not accusing Green of bad faith \u2013 ie, of knowingly making false claims. It is difficult to discern Swedish extradition law without being a Swedish legal expert or relying on them, which is why it's a good idea for people like Green not to do it, especially in a periodical. But motives aside, what he told his readers under the guise of legal expertise is unquestionably false, and it had serious consequences for how this whole debate has been perceived.</p> <p>This is why this is so crucial: if Sweden (and/or Britain) would provide some meaningful assurance that Assange would not be extradited to the US to face espionage charges for WikiLeaks' journalism, then the vast majority of asylum supporters (including me) would loudly demand that he immediately travel to Stockholm to confront those allegations; Assange himself has said he would do so. That gives the lie to the ugly slander that those who have expressed support for Ecuador's asylum decision are dismissive of the sex assault claims or do not care about seeing them resolved.</p> <p>Speaking for myself, I have always said the same thing about those allegations in Sweden from the moment they emerged: they are serious and deserve legal resolution. It is not Assange or his supporters preventing that resolution, but the Swedish and British governments, which are strangely refusing even to negotiate as to how Assange's rights against <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/national/us-intends-to-chase-assange-cables-show-20120817-24e1l.html\">unjust extradition and political persecution</a> can be safeguarded along with the rights of the complainants to have their allegations addressed. Green's false claim that the Swedish government is unable to act because it has no final authority over extradition has seriously distorted this issue, and it is why it should be promptly and prominently corrected by the New Statesman.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong>: On Twitter today, one of the four legal sources cited here, Mark Klamberg, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Klamberg/status/239028648424898560\">claimed</a> that I \"distorted\" his argument by omitting certain claims he made.

  "<p>The Republicans roll into Tampa next week \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/22/tropical-storm-isaac-republicans-tampa?CMP=twt_gu\">hurricanes permitting</a> \u2013 for their <a href=\"http://www.gopconvention2012.com/\">national convention</a> where Mitt Romney will be officially confirmed as the party's candidate for president.</p> <p>The build-up to the convention has been overshadowed by the highly controversial \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/23/todd-akin-10-points-behind?newsfeed=true\">legitimate rape</a>\" remarks made by Todd Atkin, a congressman from Missouri, and his subsequent refusal to quit his bid for re-election despite pressure from the party's leadership.</p> <p>But while the US media has largely focused on this unedifying internal battle, Mitt Romney has laid out his all-important <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/23/us-usa-campaign-romney-idUSBRE87J0P020120823\">energy plans</a> for the country. The headline is that, if elected as president, he will make the US \"energy independent\" by 2020 and, by doing so, create three million jobs.</p> <p>To eliminate the nation's reliance on imported oil and gas, Romney says he will lift many offshore drilling restrictions and free up states to use federal lands for energy production. By contrast, there was little focus in his plan on renewables, such as wind and solar. In essence, he has merged George W Bush's \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/01/usa.julianborger\">we're addicted to oil</a>\" remarks with Sarah Palin's \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/jul/14/sarah-palin-energy-obama\">drill, baby, drill</a>\". (It's possibly not a coincidence that his plan was announced just hours after he had raised <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gBxsTI0Jw7k51L44lxPxezIoiC4w?docId=CNG.dfed6bdcd8930778f0ca53ccf91435e1.71\">$7m from oil industry executives</a> at an election fundraiser in Texas.)</p> <p>But Obama hasn't exactly moved heaven and earth to differentiate himself from Romney on energy. Yes, he certainly talks up renewables more \u2013 his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xsZ45Weng0\">latest campaign ad</a> shows him next to solar panels \u2013 but at his own fundraiser on Wednesday, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/08/23/romney-rolling-out-domestic-energy-plan/\">he said</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Oil production is up. Natural gas is up. But we're also doubling the energy that we get from wind and solar. That is clean, it's renewable, it's homegrown, it's creating jobs all across America.</p> </blockquote> <p>Nowhere amid all this talk of energy independence was any explicit reference to the climate implications of increased exploitation of \"homegrown\" fossil fuels. While the subject remains utterly toxic for Republicans, even Obama rarely raises the topic these days. This week, an <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/245011-obama-spox-hints-climate-will-stay-in-campaign-background\">Obama spokesman indicated</a> that climate change would not be a major campaigning issue for Democrats:</p> <blockquote> <p>Clearly [climate change] is something that is important to the administration, but right now we are obviously going to be focusing on jobs and the economy and talking about what our contrast is.</p> </blockquote> <p>Signalling the intense frustration of environmental groups on this matter, the League of Conservation Voters has even <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/244813-enviros-want-climate-question-at-obama-romney-debate\">launched an online petition</a> urging PBS's Jim Lehrer, who will moderate the first presidential TV debate on 3 October, to ask a climate-related question.</p> <p>Even more revealing, a document will be released next week at the Republican convention that will likely shine a light on just how far down the political radar climate change has fallen over the past few years in the US since the heady days when Obama routinely mentioned it during his previous election campaign.</p> <p>At each convention, the political parties publish their \"<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/08/23/do-party-platforms-really-matter/\">platform</a>\" document. In essence, it is a manifesto that has been discussed and signed-off by a committee of party representatives from across all the states. During previous presidential election, the platform has been a largely symbolic and bureaucratic exercise. But the <a href=\"http://articles.boston.com/2012-08-23/politics/33322780_1_platform-committee-gay-marriage-human-life-amendment\">US media is signalling</a> this year that the platform documents will be more intensely scrutinised than before, in part due to the internal wrangles triggered by Todd Atkins.</p> <p>On Monday and Tuesday, the Republican platform committee <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/Events/Platform-Cmte-Sends-Platform-to-GOP-Convention-Delegates/10737433193-6/\">met in Tampa</a> in advance of the convention to finalise the document. Very little has been leaked to the press \u2013 <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/23/full-gop-platform-statement-on-abortion/\">bar the section on abortion</a> \u2013 but one member of the platform committee from West Virginia has given a teaser. Conrad Lucas, the state's Republican chairman, said in a report in the <a href=\"http://dailymail.com/News/election12/201208220233\">Charleston Daily Mail</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Once the platform is released, I think the voters in West Virginia are going to be very interested because of the pro-coal and natural gas positions that are in it\"\u2026<br>Lucas also offered an amendment during committee meetings this week to include a formal statement opposing Obama's cap-and-trade energy policy. <br>\"I was happy that we got opposition to cap-and-trade reinserted in the platform, which it wasn't in 2008,\" he said. \"It was unanimously approved, which I was excited about.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>West Virginia is well known as \"coal country\", but further south in Texas, where the oil industry dominates, the state's Republican platform document has been released online (<a href=\"http://www.tfn.org/site/DocServer/20...pdf?docID=3201\">pdf</a>). It provides an eye-popping insight into Republican thinking in that part of the country. It will certainly be interesting to see how much of it feeds into the national platform document, when it is finally published next week.</p> <p>It would be easy to be distracted by the extraordinary sections on homosexuality (\"contrary to the fundamental, unchanging truths that have been ordained by God\") and the teaching of \"controversial subjects\" in schools (\"we believe theories such as life origins and environmental change should be taught as challengeable scientific theories subject to change as new data is produced\"), but let's stick to those tightly focused on energy and the environment...</p> <blockquote> <p>Protection from Extreme Environmentalists \u2013 We strongly oppose all efforts of the extreme environmental groups that stymie legitimate business interests.

  "<p><em>I'm a bit of a gaming addict and was perfectly happy with my seven-year-old Xbox 360 until I saw Battlefield 3 running on a friend's gaming PC. It blew me away. I have been patiently waiting for the next gen consoles to come out but can wait no more: I need a decent gaming PC to satisfy my cravings. As I am normally a console gamer, I would play games through my HD TV, so I can lounge on my couch with a wireless keyboard and mouse rather than be cramped on an office chair. I'd also love to use it as a media centre, so I could record Freeview channels. I have a budget of about \u00a31,000, and would like it to be as quiet as possible. Can you help?</em><br><strong>Alex</strong></p> <p>I expect that if you asked a thousand gamers this question, you'd get at least a thousand different answers. There are so many different parts that the number of combinations is impossibly large. The answer also requires a balancing act, because your \u00a31,000 budget will not enable you buy the top-rated components in many categories without making sacrifices elsewhere.</p> <p>Fortunately, there is a wonderful website called <a href=\"http://pcpartpicker.com/uk/\">PC Part Picker</a>. This allows you to build a system and buy the parts. It aims to restrict your choices to parts that are compatible with one another. It also provides user ratings and benchmark results so that you can check the effects of changing particular components. You can check the system I specced on your behalf at <a href=\"http://pcpartpicker.com/uk/p/ft9r\"> http://pcpartpicker.com/uk/p/ft9r</a>. Click the Edit button to change the parts for ones you prefer.</p> <p>I've taken a somewhat conservative approach. In general, I've gone for well known parts rather than obscure ones, so you can check up on them by reading reviews. I've also tried to allow for upgrades.</p> <p>I don't think there will be too much argument about the best processor: a 3.4GHz quad-core Intel Core i5-3570K (\u00a3174.94). This is the Ivy Bridge equivalent of the Sandy Bridge i5-2500K, which is the chip in my main PC. You can overclock it to 4GHz and possibly more if you install a better cooler, such as the Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO (\u00a326.65).</p> <p>Choice of motherboard is tricky, as you need something that supports Ivy Bridge, USB 3.0 and so on. The Gigabyte GA-Z77-D3H ATX LGA1155 seems good value at \u00a377.72: it's around \u00a3100 less than an Asus Sabertooth Z77.</p> <p>The GA-Z77-D3H has four memory slots and supports up to 32GB of memory. However, 8GB is enough for most gaming, so start with two 4GB sticks of Corsair Vengeance DDR3-1600 low-profile memory (\u00a337.99). You can always fill the two empty slots later, if you really need 16GB or more.</p> <p>The price of solid state disks (SSDs) has fallen to the point where any new gaming PC should have one. The 128GB Samsung 830 is another economical choice at \u00a379.98, and while it isn't the fastest, it seems to be pretty reliable. It has enough space for 64-bit Windows Home Premium (\u00a371.05) and your main games. A 128GB Crucial M4 (\u00a378.95) would be an alternative.</p> <p>For a second drive, I've picked the 1TB Western Digital Caviar Black (\u00a379.76), to store your movies, photos and other applications. It's nippy at 7200RPM. I've had years of good experience with Caviar drives, but some people prefer other brands. A 1TB Samsung Spinpoint HD103SJ (\u00a366.22) or Seagate would be a good alternative. If you need 2TB, you can get a bigger, slower 5400RPM drive such as the Samsung Spinpoint HD204UI (\u00a375.84) or WD Caviar Green (\u00a380.00) for slightly more money.</p> <p>For an optical drive, I've chucked in a Sony DVD/CD Writer because the price is so low (\u00a312.88) that you may as well have one. Of course, you could step up to a Lite-On iHOS104-06 (\u00a341.52) for a Blu-ray drive.</p> <p>You will obviously need a power supply and an ATX case in which to fit all the parts. The Cooler Master HAF 922 (\u00a386.38) is a popular case but the design is somewhat racy by normal (boring) standards. Perhaps the <a href=\"http://www.coolermaster.com/product.php?product_id=6841\">Cooler Master Silencio 550</a> (\u00a364.12) would be a better choice as it includes foam mats and air vents designed to reduce noise. </p> <p>For a power supply, I've picked the Corsair 650W (\u00a383.58), which should be big enough. Since it's not built into the case, you can easily upgrade it if you want to run some high-end graphics cards.</p> <p>The graphics card is usually the most expensive part of a games PC, and often the most contentious. The 920MHz Sapphire Radeon HD 7850 is a good all-rounder with 2GB of video memory, at a very reasonable \u00a3177.98. The same chipset is used in other cards such as the Gigabyte GV-R785OC-2GD (\u00a3168.94) and the Asus HD7850-DC2-2GD5 (\u00a3187.98), so you could equally well choose one of these, and the Gigabyte card would go with the Gigabyte motherboard. </p> <p>All this brings the total to \u00a3906.68, excluding a Freeview tuner.</p> <p>Should you want to upgrade in the future, you could add a second Radeon HD 7850 card using ATI's <a href=\"http://www.directron.com/whatiscf.html\">CrossFireX</a> system. This doesn't work with Nvidia cards, which are the preferred choice for Adobe CS software. The Gigabyte motherboard supports CrossFireX but not <a href=\"http://www.nvidia.co.uk/object/sli_technology_overview_uk.html\">Nvidia's SLI</a> system, so if you want to take that route, choose a different motherboard, such as the Asus Sabertooth Z77.</p> <p>If you mostly want to run Battlefield 3 (which I have not played), then web discussions suggest it would be worth going for a graphics card with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 570 chipset instead. Examples include the Asus ENGTX570 (\u00a3239.48), EVGA 012-P3-1573-KR (\u00a3198.68) and Zotac ZT-50203-10M (\u00a3281.98). Going for the EVGA card would not change the price significantly, but would give you much better scores on graphics benchmarks such as 3DMark and Cinebench and, one hopes, real games. If your mate's PC has a similar GeForce card, that could swing it. Ideally, buy a better one!</p> <p>As for PC gaming on a TV set, I'm not wholly convinced. Gamers tend to use high-resolution monitors with much higher pixel densities, but if you sit far enough away, it shouldn't be noticeable. If you can get drivers that will display higher resolutions, all the better. Also, TV sets tend to suffer from \"input lag\" or \"display lag\". This may be caused by the TV doing some clever post processing to improve the picture quality. If there is a noticeable lag between you pressing a button and the screen responding, then you are not going to last long in online multiplayer games.</p> <p>See if your TV has been benchmarked at <a href=\"http://www.hdtvtest.co.uk/\">HDTVTest.co.uk</a> or a similar site that measures input lag. Also check to see if your TV has a game or PC setting that avoids the problem.</p> <p>You can certainly use your new PC as a media centre, either using Microsoft's Media Center software or by installing the open source <a href=\"http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Xbox_Frontend#Running_XBMC_with_native_MythTV_Support\">XBMC with native MythTV Support</a> for Windows. You might also want to check out the <a href=\"http://plugins.tvcatchup.com/~xbmc/\">TVCatchup plugin for XBMC</a>. (What started as Xbox Media Center has no connection with Microsoft.)</p> <p>You will also need to install a DVB-T2 (Freeview) tuner card, such as Kubik's high-definition dual-tuner TBS6220 or TBS6280. The former is within your budget.</p> <p>Whether the PC will be quiet enough remains to be seen. Or heard. PCs designed for TV use tend to have slow processors and slow hard drives, no graphics cards, very small power supplies, and no fans. As a result, they can be almost silent. Your games PC won't need to use the graphics card to play movies, but the rest of it is likely to make some noise. There's no way round that, at the price. However, a <a href=\"http://www.watercoolinguk.co.uk/cat/Water-Cooling-Kits_40.html\">water cooling system</a> could reduce fan noise, and you get loads of bragging points for installing one of these.<br></p>",
  "<p>By <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/24/prince-harry-naked-pictures-sun?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">publishing a naked picture of Prince Harry</a>, the Sun has done what it has been doing ever since Rupert Murdoch first acquired it in 1969 \u2013 sticking up two fingers to the establishment.</p> <p>Daring to go where others fear to tread is in the paper's, and the publisher's, DNA. It has a tradition of upsetting the royal family (remember the bikini pictures of a pregnant Princess Diana, the toe-sucking pictures of the Duchess of York and the advance publication of the Queen's 1992 Christmas broadcast). With that history, we should hardly be surprised by its latest publish-and-be-damned decision.</p> <p>The timing, however, is an altogether different matter, and that has certainly increased the risk factor. A year ago its Sunday sister, the News of the World, was closed because of the phone-hacking scandal, which gave rise to the Leveson inquiry with its chairman currently preparing recommendations for a new form of press regulation. The Sun has also become embroiled in the affair, with its own reporters having been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jan/28/sun-arrests-rebekah-brooks?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">arrested by police investigating payments to public officials</a>. So it, and the humbled Murdoch, should surely be on the back foot. But a prince's wayward behaviour has given it a chance to do the opposite. It has revelled in the opportunity to revisit its old territory.</p> <p>Before considering whether or not that has been a wise move, let's clear up some misunderstandings. Claims that the press has been cowed by Leveson are well wide of the mark. What has happened in the last two days is no different from what would have happened before.</p> <p>Down the years, at various key moments, the royal family has pleaded for the tabloids to leave them alone. Everyone seems to have forgotten the relentless pursuit of Princess Margaret, let alone that of Princess Diana. Editors nodded politely, cleaned up their act for a week or two and then took up business as usual, citing public interest as a defence for their various intrusions. This high-minded justification cloaked the commercial reality: readers gravitated to papers that published royal tittle-tattle.</p> <p>Though it may be cynical to say it, Diana's death changed matters in the palace's favour. Editors desperate to placate readers in that bizarre period of public mourning amended their code and the Press Complaints Commission felt the wind of change. It acted on behalf of the royal family to secure special privileges of press restraint for Diana's sons and, in company with the monarch's lawyers, policed them vigorously.</p> <p>The PCC has always striven to suggest it is an equal opportunities body. But it cannot deny it has been particularly effective on behalf of the royals. Many pictures and stories have not seen the light of day. Prior restraint has worked wonders for the young princes.</p> <p>It is fair to say that the PCC has not acted as a censor. Its senior staff have made it abundantly clear that they do not act for the palace. They are merely messengers. It is for editors to decide whether to comply with requests they pass on. But the way in which the messages were couched is an important factor that we cannot know for sure. Did the PCC, in its role as royal postman, appear to endorse the message urging restraint?</p> <p>Then there is the role of the royal family's lawyers to consider. By sending letters to newspapers did they seek to imply that publication of this or that picture would be in breach of the law? If so, as the Sun has shown, this could well have been an empty threat.</p> <p>Though worried by the increasing use of human rights legislation protecting privacy, editors know that publication in the public interest remains a trump card. In the case of the Prince Harry photos, the Sun's public defence is pretty thin, but it isn't entirely without merit either. I would imagine a decent barrister making a fist of an argument about public concern for the prince's security and the potential for blackmail. Similarly, taking account of a previous PCC ruling, in which the commission cleared a magazine for publishing pictures of a woman without her permission because they were widely disseminated on the net, counsel would certainly argue that the same was true of the Harry pictures.</p> <p>There, of course, is the central point in the Sun's favour. Print is merely trying to reflect the reality of the internet. It may seem like a specious argument because it is up to a publication to uphold its own tastes and standards. There is plenty of stuff available on the net that no editor would wish, or dare, to publish.</p> <p>But the Sun will point out that readers have lapped it up. There will not be a repeat of the boycott, by readers or advertisers, that led to the demise of the News of the World. And there, of course, is the central problem facing Leveson, just as the good judge feared. The net is global. It crosses frontiers. It does not answer to national laws. It does not respect privacy. More than two years ago Facebook's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/jan/11/facebook-privacy\" title=\"\">said that privacy was dead</a>.</p> <p>None of this should be taken as support for the Sun, which was invading people's privacy long before Zuckerberg was born. It is, however, a lesson in the reality of the situation. The Sun's ethical boundaries are now set by social media. Leveson beware.</p>",
  "<h2>GCSE results</h2> <p>Thanks to all the teachers, parents and school staff who joined the discussion around this year's GCSE results. There was strong reaction from many to claims that certain subjects had been downgraded to curb grade inflation:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17852541\"><strong>stanleybalds</strong></a> posts:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I taught a bottom set this year-worked my arse off so that they were in with a chance of Cs, they worked their arses off even though they found neither school or English easy, and I now go into work this morning expecting both them and me to have been liberally rogered by Gove due to his educational experiments. The sad thing is these 13 mean a lot to me-but all my colleagues have worked hard, colleagues around the country have worked hard, and thousands and thousands of kids have worked just in order that they are sacrificed on Gove's sword of revolution.

Is this part of the wider curriculum having a positive effect or has Mr Gove ensured that this is a clear signpost of where he sees pupils achieving?</p> <p>Someone on the TES commented that \"the goalposts have not only been moved they've been moved to another planet!\" I would think that actually the goalposts have been taken down and the playing fields are about to be sold off when the schools are closed.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17850118\"><strong>MsBritney</strong></a> says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Brilliant.

Their improvements on previous GCSE work were based on hard graft and intensive literacy intervention - i.e. teaching and learning, which is sort of the point of students being there in the first place.</p> <p>At least if the results are lower, we'll have less of the gubbins about exams being easier. (Though we'll have more beewatcher-watcher OFSTED inspections to look forward to - joy.)

'Where are you going tonight, who with?' 'What time will you be home' 'What time did you get in last night?' 'What time do you call this'.)<br>While some people dream of mum's home cooking and laundry, it does grow tiresome. I feel like I'm in limbo - desperately wanting to be independent and an 'adult' (which my age should suggest I should be) but unable to do so.

Assuming you have a good relationship with your family then most people will have parents or family that they can fall back on and to help them out when things go pear shaped.

Hydrogenated fats continued to be a 'hidden killer' in foods for many years without successive governments or the food producers batting an eyelid - it's only recently, when the weight of evidence has started to tell, that anything's been done. This is a small move in the right direction.<br>As a kid the only 'ready meals' we saw were Vesta curries and the execrable 'Smash' instant potato (which did a passable impersonation of lime mortar). Nowadays whole aisles of supermarkets are taken up by stuff that has a host of ingredients that we can't spell, never mind understand the effect they have on our health.<br>I'm guessing that most people would prefer home-prepared food over 'junk'. However, if we look at the way many people live now, the temptation of unhealthy food is all too often the easy option.<br>Some of us were really lucky to have both parents at home, one of whom had sufficient time to cook (and shop) every day. We had good healthy food on the table both at home and at school (let's not forget how what passes for school meals influences our kids eating habits). For too many youngsters - and this is when our eating habits are formed - a healthy lifestyle is unavailable, even if they are educated enough to know what one is.<br>The answer to this problem lies not just in berating people about their lifestyles (although they have a share in responsibility for this), it's also about lining up other factors - such as the big food producers - so that healthier lifestyles are encouraged. It's been said before, but allowing fast food chains a monopoly at the Olympics is not exactly a step in the right direction. Remember, these people would sell us radioactive material to eat if they could a. do it legally and b. make a profit from it.<br>Until we realise this isn't purely about the individual (or the nanny state for that matter) but is actually about a multitude of alterable factors (and we have the will to change them) we will make little progress.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17855592\"><strong>salamandertome</strong></a> says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But if we look at the 'big picture' - living into your 80s and a long retirement, is a lot more appealing if you own a house with plenty of equity in it, so you can downsize, have a pot of savings, a final salary pension that will increase with inflation and either private health insurance, or the ability to pay for private care.<br>If you have none of these things, the incentives for giving up all the stuff you enjoy, but will make you less healthy, is surely reduced?<br>So I think if we had a society that genuinely valued the elderly, and took care of them, regardless of how economically successfully or lucky they had been in their work lives - then that would be a better place to start from when convincing people to drop their unhealthy habits. As it is, we are going in the opposite direction, middle income workers that used to get a decent final salary pension, no longer will.

The supermarkets have closed most greengroccers/butchers on the high street so even those inclined to eat healthily - such as my grandma - now have a journey involving 2 buses to get to a supermarket. Factor in the taxi home (have you tried getting on a bus with 6 carrier bags?) and you are better of eating take away.<br>We are now 2 generations into this problem and lots of the teenagers I meet are as disgusted by a blackberry or rhubarb as I would have been by snails - they have literally never seen or tasted most fresh fruit/veg or unprocessed meat.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17852917\"><strong>MondoBongo</strong></a> adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Anyone who has ever been poor knows that the very fact of being poor is such hard work. All your energy is spent on trying to make ends meet. Juggling what to pay and what to put off paying. You are constantly tired because stress is very bad for sleep. It becomes harder and harder to try to snap out of the \"poor trance\" into which you fall. Every decision becomes a struggle. Deciding what to eat, then buying ingredients, then cooking a meal can seem like just one more daunting task every day. But it is perhaps the most important task.

McDonald's is the example most cited here but I think the problem is mainly due to the prevalence of packaged, processed foods people buy in supermarkets eg. Anything pre-cooked or prepared, frozen foods, microwave meals etc.<br>I think of a good example of a family I know that used to live in Zimbabwe - back home they used to eat whatever they wanted and were relatively healthy with no weight issues. Having since moved to the UK, they still eat whatever they want - however they are now all overweight. While back in Zim they ate whatever foods were available eg. potatoes, rice, meat and veg that were not pre-prepared and had nothing added to them. Following the same habit in the UK brings a different result as the cheapest, most widely available foods are all processed.<br>Processed foods are BAD for you and should be taxed in the same way that cigarettes and alcohol are. This would encourage people to eat the healthier foods that are available in the supermarkets.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Housebuilding</h2> <p>Ministers are considering <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/23/ministers-house-building\">a new wave of publicly funded housebuilding</a>, with a relaxation of planning regulations among a range of measures being considered by the housing minster Grant Schnapps.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/23/ministers-house-building?commentpage=1#comment-17851568\"><strong>Takingnotes</strong></a>fears for the quality of the proposed new housing:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Out of curiosity, I viewed a new build near where a friend lives. You walked into the front where no provision was available to hang coats, or place shoes, the width of the hall barely allowed for a pushchair and no storage was available for one. The front room was furnished, as a show home, there was a television fixed to the wall and a sofa directly opposite along the wall, the knee room between wall and sofa was limited and there certainly was no space for a coffee table or such like, the other end of the room had patio doors leading to a small patch of grass but in the way was the dining table, which pretended to seat four. The kitchen was an absolute nightmare of cupboards and doors bumping each other and no real working room for cooking. I think they presumed that ready meals were the order of the day.<br>Upstairs immediately in front was a space that may once have been called a walk in wardrobe where only a cot and no additional furniture (could have fitted) was displayed, described as the third bedroom of course. the second bedroom boasted a fitted wardrobe and bed and no room for anything else but the real treat was the master bedroom. Here was the obligatory walk-in shower and another fitted wardrobe, barely any room either side of the double bed and no space for a bedside cabinet or other furniture. The so called bathroom was pint sized with extra small fittings. Attached to the house was a small garage so do not buy anything bigger than a mini type car and don't dream of a people carrier or posh motor, it would not fit. If a house were to get any smaller than this I dread to think how they expect people to live in them.

They can get away with their poor design and construction standards because they have a strangle-hold monopoly on the market. The problem is the UK's planning regime, which suppresses small developments and self-build projects.<br>The specification of social housing in the UK is much higher than most private buyers can afford. A few years ago - while Brown was still pm - some bright spark suggested kick-starting the housing market by selling off the Big Builders unsold stock to the housing associations, and thus killing two birds with one stone. The housing associations wouldn't have anything to do with the idea, because it would be uneconomic to bring the stock of big builder new-builds up to their existing specifications.<br>If you look at the standards of private housing in Europe - design, space, materials specification, detailing etc... you will find the UK standards are very much lower. The reason is very simple - in the sane world beyond our shores if you can't find a house you like, or you can't afford a home you like, it is much easier and affordable to build your own. In the rest of the developed world, from Finland to Canada and New Zealand it is the self-build industry that sets the standard that the big builders have to compete with. So much so that they take self-build as much for granted as you in the UK find it peculiar and unusual. For goodness sakes, if you don't like the accomodation on offer why don't you build your own? What's stopping you?<br>Put it another way - if you're not prepared to build your own house what right have you to complain about the houses other people build?<br>Planning regulations are the root of our housing crisis. Not building regs, mind you - just the process of finding affordable land and securing permission to build on it.<br>Nothing will change in the UK's housing market until the state - (small 's') - has much, much less control than it does now.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17854473\"><strong>inquisitormedina</strong></a> writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I'd like to see some real innovation in the house building sector. There is a real opportunity here for the UK to ditch some of its old fashioned NIMBYism and backwardness and really engage on a mass building project for the future.<br>The govt should sweep away a lot of the restrictions on planning permission and set out clear, sustainable, measured goals for a new kind of housing revolution. I'd like to see fewer detached/semi detached houses with garages and gardens. I'd like to see a mass building of medium density, architecturally valuable home complexes (not just concrete boxes). I'd like each of these to be built from modern green materials with Aeorogel insulation, nanosprayed solar panelled windows and roof top wind turbines, combine with a micro generator and a below ground heat gathering system so that each block is essentially its own self powering grid with lots of smart metres. I'd like each block to have its own shared fleet of electric vehicles and a roof top garden and balconies. A communal 3D printer and shop space at the base would be good too.

We are now living in the information age revolution and trying to lumber on with Victorian/Edwardian city models. We could do this, and if the private sector isn't stimulated and can't make money out of these schemes then frankly we might as well give up on everything now.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17854569\"><strong>boondoggle</strong></a> adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Unfortunately, paving the countryside and slashing planning and building control regulation to allow unconstrained development isn't going to get us to some imagined condition in which everyone who fancies themselves middle class gets a detached single family home in the countryside or a leafy suburb. This is the carrot that the pro-developer lobby dangles, but I have yet to see any proof that unconstrained development will do anything more than exacerbate our transport and environmental problems.<br>According to the government's 2010 English housing survey, in 2010, there were 22.4 million dwellings in England, of which 34% were rental properties (about half public and half private rentals). Fully 21% were built since 1980, and the most common council tax band is band A, at 24%. Only 20% of dwellings were flats, despite the fact that in 2009, the ONS reports that over 81% of us live in urban areas, the vast majority of those being high-density urban areas.<br>This presents some very obvious questions about the housing market and what the Tory-dominated coalition has proposed to do with planning policy.<br>Firstly, there is apparently a theory that if we just gut those pesky planning regulations and let developers build what they like where they like, house prices will fall to an affordable level. But how much housing will we have to build, and where? And what is affordable?<br>If the problem is that Rupert and Fiona want house prices to drop a couple thou' in suburban Cornwall so they can go on a mung bean tasting holiday in Kashmir, we can probably achieve it. But if we want a retail employee and family on \u00a330,000 a year to be able to afford a four-bed detached house in the GLA, the amount of supply-side pump-priming we would have to do - and the resultant impact on sustainability, quality of life, food production and knock-on costs to government - would be astronomical.<br>Equally obviously, we have an unbalanced economy with a massive primate city. We have lots of cheap homes on Skye but no jobs, and lots of jobs in the south-east but no cheap homes. If we can provide a living wage in Caithness and Sutherland, people can afford housing. But on the flip side, no matter how many rickety shitpiles we allow to be thrown up on the outskirts of London, people will still not be able to buy a house there for \u00a350,000.<br>Secondly, is there a house building crisis? 21% of dwellings have been constructed in the last 30 years or so, and obviously an even larger percentage have been constructed since the Town and Country Planning Act was introduced in 1947. Over the same time, the UK population in total has increased from just over 56 million to just over 62, an increase of only 10%. To me, these basic statistics suggest an extreme degree of scepticism needs to be applied to claims that we can't build enough houses - especially coming from developers or politicians who take money from/socialise with them. Note how this also relates to the first question above - if over 4 million dwellings have been built since 1980 and prices have still increased, how many do we need to build to dramatically reduce prices?)<br>As we all know, there are many other reasons why house prices have increased. Among these are declining real wages, changes in family structure, a house-price bubble caused by a mania for property owership and speculation, the related banking crisis and unavailability of credit for a large number of prospective buyers, an increasingly unbalanced economy characterised by wages in rural areas and the north declining against wages in the south-east and the cost of transport (only likely to increase - particularly if we permit uncontrolled sprawl).<br>There is a massive and obvious gap between the resources of first time buyers who don't have family financial assistance and property prices in areas where work is to be found - nothing statistically seems to suggest that this has been produced by a failure to provide enough dwellings.<br>It can be easily seen why politicians, especially Tory politicians, don't want to address any of the factors above. They're either problems too hard or too controversial for them to attempt to solve, or problems created by their own parties. It's much easier to blame environmental standards, planning bodies and pro-planning groups that try to protect our collective quality of life than to admit that the problem is either largely one's own fault or beyond one's control.<br>What do we do to provide affordable homes for all? Well-designed, high-density urban mixed-use developments owned by the public and rented at an affordable price geared to actual incomes. Ideologically, it's obvious why the Tories prefer to gut regulation and funnel profits to their developer pals.</p> </blockquote>",

Truly, the Sex Pistols were never like this.</p> <p>But then Green Day long ago ditched any semblance of punk-rock \"cred\", a move that's served them well.

Subsequent LPs disappointed, until 2004's American Idiot \u2013 a punk-rock opera that's now a successful <a href=\"http://americanidiotthemusical.com/\" title=\"\">Broadway show</a> and soon-to-be Hollywood movie \u2013 returned them to club multi-platinum.</p> <p>It's the songs from these twin peaks of their discography that are received most feverishly tonight: the blunt, dynamic Longview (a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BmkBroiw1s\" title=\"\">Pictures of Lily</a> for the <a href=\"http://vanswarpedtour.com/\" title=\"\">Warped Tour</a> generation), the irresistibly catchy power-chords of American Idiot. New material debuted tonight, from forthcoming album trilogy \u00a1Uno!, \u00a1Dos!, \u00a1Tre!, is similarly immediate: Stop When the Red Lights Flash is bold and brash, while new single Oh Love boasts a faux-Celtic chorus that makes <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5626WzsfMw\" title=\"\">Mull of Kintyre</a> sound like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyF7g-dHO7g\" title=\"\">Metal Machine Music</a>.

Amazingly, it is 43 years since the Delius concerto was last heard at the Proms. There are obvious weaknesses in its construction, but Petrenko held the work together with great commitment, and <a href=\"http://www.tasminlittle.com/\" title=\"\">Tasmin Little</a>'s enraptured account of this most improvisatory of works was so eloquent that it blew most doubts away.</p> <p>Shostakovich's 10th has its weaknesses, too, but Petrenko's control and the Liverpool orchestra's playing made light of them. The great span of the opening movement can be more brooding than Petrenko allowed, but his attention to detail and string balance was gripping at all times, and he drew playing of exceptional beauty throughout \u2013 nowhere more so than in the keening woodwind solos that herald the tumult of the finale.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.maxopus.com/\" title=\"\">Davies</a> may be Master of the Queen's Music now, and this Ninth Symphony, premiered by these artists <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/11/royal-liverpool-philharmonic-petrenko-review\" title=\"\">earlier this summer</a>, may be dedicated to the monarch on her jubilee, but there is barely a bar in it that feels celebratory. Played without a break, the symphony unfolds darkly, before a brass sextet, seated above and to one side of the orchestra, introduces a succession of jaunty flourishes. These unleash a series of disintegrations and crises from which the remainder of the work seeks a fragile closure. It may not be Davies's most characteristic orchestral work, but it is indisputably one of his most engaged and it may well claim a lasting place in the repertoire.</p> <p>\u2022 Available on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01m0qs3#programme-broadcasts\" title=\"\">iPlayer</a> until 30 August.

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://thesullivanfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Leon H Sullivan Foundation</a>, founded on the legacy of the late civil rights leader and anti-apartheid pioneer Reverend Sullivan, is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/22/equatorial-guinea-human-rights\" title=\"\">holding its ninth biennial Sullivan summit in Equatorial Guinea this week</a>. In doing so, it is disregarding a global standard of principles created by its namesake and championed by the organisation.</p> <p>The summit, whose theme is \"Africa rising\", is being billed, in part, as a human rights conference. The organisation's choice of host, Equatorial Guinea, has provoked an outcry from many African and international human rights groups over concerns that the summit will be used to polish the <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/region/equatorial-guinea\" title=\"\">tarnished human rights record</a> of Equatorial Guinea's President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo. The Obiang regime, in power for 33 years, has been widely criticised for rights abuses, repression, and corruption.</p> <p>In response to critics, the foundation appears to have embarked on a public relations campaign for the Obiang regime.

She has accused her critics of failing to check facts or verify \"simple truths\".</p> <p>So we checked the facts and measured them against the <a href=\"http://thesullivanfoundation.org/about/global-sullivan-principles\" title=\"\">global Sullivan principles</a>, a corporate code of conduct initiated by Sullivan that remains a leading standard of corporate social responsibility championed by the Sullivan Foundation.

Its journalists are also getting death threats after being denounced by the president during his weekly TV show, and the magazine's editorial director was recently sued by Correa for $10m in \"moral damages\" for suggesting the president knew his brother was making millions of dollars from state contracts.</p> <p>After a public outcry, the president withdrew one suit and issued a pardon in the other, but he defended his right to take such action: \"Do we have an unwritten law that we can't sue a journalist? Since when? So nobody should sue Murdoch and his partners in crime in Britain?\"</p> <p>The editorial director of Vanguardia, Juan Carlos Calder\u00f3n, had earlier told the Guardian he was being targeted for criticising the administration, and accused Correa of double standards. \"The government said it has granted asylum to Assange because he is politically persecuted for defending freedom of expression. But the same thing happens to us,\" he said. \"This is not a country with the free press described by Correa.\"</p> <p>He is not alone. The domestic press watchdog Fundamedios describes the situation in Ecuador as a low-intensity war on journalists that appears to be escalating. Last year, it recorded 151 cases of physical aggression against reporters, up from 101 in 2009. It says this increase is largely the result of the constant abuse directed at journalists by Correa during his weekly TV broadcast, which is carried by almost every channel.</p> <p>It also notes that 17 radio stations have been shut down this year for transgressing regulations and that the government has recently issued new rules that will oblige internet service providers to provide the IP addresses of their users to the authorities, even without a court order.</p> <p>\"There is a huge gap between what Correa says about press freedom and reality,\" said C\u00e9sar Ricaurte, head of Fundamedios. \"If Assange were Ecuadorean, I dare say he would already be in jail.\" International free press campaigners, including the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and Reporters Without Borders, have also accused Correa of trying to discredit and intimidate critics.</p> <p>Correa said such judgments were misguided. \"The Ecuadorean and Latin American press is not like the European or North American press, which has some professional ethics. They are used to being above the law, to blackmail, to extort. I am sorry about good people on an international level who defend this kind of press.\"</p> <p>He denied that radio station closures were politically motivated, saying some were simply music channels that failed to conform to broadcasting rules. This will open up space for more public channels.</p> <p>An insight into Correa's strategy was given by his chief communications adviser, Fernando Alvarado who described the media as \"weeds that need to be cleaned\" and replaced by flowers (public and community media outlets) in a recent interview with the Mexican publication Gatopardo.Since Correa \u2013 a US-educated economist who describes himself as a moderate leftist \u2013 came to power in 2007, there has been a wider range of state and private ownership of newspapers and TV stations. There is more scope for critical non-governmental organisations and greater access to senior officials. The interviews given by Correa on Thursday were carefully staged in terms of lighting and camera work, but unscripted.</p> <p>Media watchers said Correa's approach -\u2013 particularly in his weekly live broadcasts \u2013 was as confrontational as that adopted by Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela, but less destructive. \"In some regards, it is like Ch\u00e1vez. But Ch\u00e1vez went too far. Though there is confrontation here, no TV stations have been closed, which was the case in Venezuela,\" said Maurice Cerbino, a professor at Andina Simon Bolivar University. The confrontation, he said, was understandable given the previous situation in Ecuador in which the private media colluded with the government.</p> <p>Correa's supporters say the administration is carrying out an overdue rebalancing of the media, which was previously skewed too heavily towards private ownership by a handful of families. When Correa came to power in 2007, there was only one public media organisation, Radio Nacional.</p> <p>Those who work in public media say this has created a far healthier media environment because advertisers have less influence. \"The reports by the Committee to Protect Journalists and Amnesty are not false, but a lot of them are exaggerated,\" said Orlando P\u00e9rez, the editorial director of El Tel\u00e9grafo.</p> <p>\"Ecuador is going through a golden age for media freedom. Citizens now have so much space for expression, through social networks, public media, community media as well as blogs and websites.\" To demonstrate his editorial independence, he pointed to a front-page story in his public newspaper exposing a corruption in the state-owned oil company PetroEcuador.</p> <p>P\u00e9rez claims to have set the stage for Assange's first interview with Correa, which later lead to asylum. He denies that this has anything to do with a government strategy. \"We didn't choose Assange. Assange chose us,\" he said.</p> <p>Correa said he was trying to support an individual threatened by a powerful state. \"I don't agree with everything Mr Assange did. I never said that. But I believe he is entitled to a just legal process,\" the president said. \"Assange never stole the information. It was handed to him by Bradley Manning. He just distributed it. So why didn't the newspapers that published it also get sanctioned? That is an international double standard. The answer is that the newspapers have power, whereas Mr Assange is just a citizen. That is why certain countries want to crush him with all their weight.\"</p> <p>His motives are widely disputed. Some accept the president's idealistic claims. Cynics say he is trying to distract attention from the criticism of his heavy handling of the domestic media. Another theory is that he is a political opportunist who understands the benefits of picking high-profile fights, in this case, with the UK. Having gone further than any other Latin American leader outside of Argentina in criticising Britain over the Falklands earlier this year, he has now found a new cause. William Hague's threat to remove the diplomatic status of the Ecuadorean embassy simply played into his hands.</p> <p>\"The UK foreign minister has given him the perfect excuse to unite the left in a confrontation with imperialists,\" Calder\u00f3n observes. \"People on the left have an anti-imperialist gland. All you have to do it touch it to secrete anthems (of solidarity).\"</p> <p>But the decision to grant asylum has made waves inside Ecuador's government. Career bureaucrats are uneasy at a decision made by political appointees. Some feel it is of dubious legality and could backfire in terms of trade with the European Union. On the streets, however, the move appears to have widespread public backing. There were demonstrations of support in Quito this week. Women's groups have even seconded Correa's claim that the accusations against Assange would not constitute felonies in Latin America.</p> <p>\"I totally agree with the decision to grant asylum to Assange,\" said Virginia G\u00f3mez, former director of the Attention and Help Centre for Women. \"The allegations against Assange would not be crimes here. Women are empowered, but not to the point that if a condom breaks it is a sex crime. That is beyond our imagination.\"</p> <p>Quito is no place for the politically half-hearted. Local people are proud of their radicalism and burn effigies of politicians \u2013 including the current president \u2013 at raucous New Year's Eve parades. Many feel it is their duty to kick out poorly performing leaders, something they have done with remarkable regularity.</p> <p>After just five years in power, Correa is the longest-serving president in a century. US embassy cables leaked by WikiLeaks described him as the most popular president the country had ever had. Without exception, everyone interviewed for this story said Correa had been good for Ecuador. Even the fiercest critics of his media policies praised the president's work on health and education. As his cavalcade drove up to the interview venue, girls leaned out of the window and screamed as if they had seen a rock star.</p> <p>The question now is whether the Assange case will consolidate or erode this popularity if it drags on until the presidential elections next February. Correa was unwilling to speculate. \"I am an economist, not an astrologer. I can't say how long it will take. It could be solved tomorrow. It depends on the UK. Or it could take a long time. What is the next step? Keep talking. We have never closed the door to conversation. From the beginning, we have been talking to Britain, Sweden and even the USA to solve this situation. But we will never lower our principles or risk the life or rights of Assange.\"</p>",
  "<p>Anyone who cares about the WWE video game franchise knows two things. First, the best title the series has ever produced was 2003's WWE Smackdown! Here Comes The Pain, which was a close to perfect a wrestling title could possibly get. Secondly, if last year's entry is anything to go by, the series is in desperate need of some new ideas and an engine overhaul. </p> <p>It's worth bearing both of these aspects in mind when considering the chances of Yuke's forthcoming entry, WWE 13 \u2013 and not least because Here Comes The Pain's cover star, Brock Lesnar, returned to the WWE's roster just over four months ago. </p> <p>Unfortunately, the dicky engine doesn't have a prayer of being addressed in WWE 13, and this makes sense in a way. If the smart money is correct and the next generation of consoles is less than a year away, then Yuke's decision to hold off on implementing a new technology is prudent. After all, what would be the point in inserting any radical changes that may find themselves out of date within a year? </p> <p>So, WWE 13 isn't to be the recipient of better gameplay mechanics \u2013 although it should be noted the game's Predator engine benefits from a number of necessary tweaks this year. Instead, Yuke's strategy for shifting units seems to be mainly content-based. Unlike last year's game, however, the approach with WWE 13 has been to offer more quality than quantity \u2013 although it should be pointed out that this year's roster is the biggest to ever feature in a game of this type (players have 80 wrestlers right off the bat, with the option to increase to 100 with DLC). </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395489360\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/24/1345809070258/wwe_men.jpg\" alt=\"WWE 13\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The reason that Here Comes The Pain is the franchise's high-water mark isn't just that the Yuke's wrestling engine was at its pinnacle of performance at the time. It was also due to the fact that in the period of its release, the WWE had arguably its strongest roster of superstars since the halcyon days of the early nineties when the Ultimate Warrior was the organisation's corporate face. It also boasted \u2013 as bizarre as this may sound to those who don't follow wrestling \u2013 the strongest plot writing the series had seen for ages. </p> <p>This was because it was riding a wave of success that had been set in motion in the late 1990s, during a period that WWE fans will remember, was branded as the \"WWE Attitude\" era. At the time the WWE was involved in a ratings war with WCW Nitro, which proved both good for business and for the WWE brand. WCW began the war streets ahead of its competition, and this prompted the WWE to toss the marketing rulebook in the trash and engage in increasingly edgy and preposterous plotlines to draw in audience numbers. This in turn gave rise to some of the most colourful and charismatic superstars the WWE ever produced. </p> <p>Yuke's is trying to tap into the appeal of this fertile period in the WWE's history for WWE 13. Its campaign mode doesn't plonk wrestlers from the current roster and player-created characters in a fictional storyline. Rather, the new campaign mode is set entirely during the Attitude era and covers the key matches and storylines of the eight wrestlers largely responsible for rebuilding the WWE's brand. </p> <p>Players take control of the likes of Shawn Michaels, Triple H, Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, The Undertaker and more in some of their best and most memorable matches. Each match is preceded by unlockable cinematics that detail not only the storylines that were trundling along at the time, but also how they impacted on the WWE's ratings compared to those of the WCW. </p> <p>Both cinematics and ratings charts are stored in their own separate sections once unlocked, in case players want to view them without ploughing through the campaign. Yuke's has also put a lot of effort into recreating the Attitude era in the game, including re-recording commentary tracks from that time, making sure all of the arenas and stage decorations are on the money and even using the same fonts the WWE TV show used at the the time. However, in rather revisionist turn, the logos in the campaign still read \"WWE\" rather than \"WWF\" and any mention of the latter brand has been excised from the commentary track, presumably because the organisation lost the \"WWF\" in court to the Worldwide Wildlife Fund in 2002. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395489361\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/24/1345809098266/wwe_women.jpg\" alt=\"WWE 13\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Players also have a list of objectives to accomplish in each match they take part in during the campaign mode, in order to make their matches more historically accurate. In Stone Cold Steve Austin's campaign, for example, players can win the WWE championship by simply pinning HBK, but they also have the option of triggering an in-match event, where Stone Cold clocks the referee prompting Mike Tyson to leap into the ring and issue the pin count. </p> <p>In-match events, by the way, have been kept to a minimum and only appear if they aid historical accuracy. This goes some way towards addressing complaints from fans about how, in last year's game, certain contests would end in a cinematic in which the player lost the match. However, it's likely the new campaign mode may draw some criticism from the WWE faithful as, at the time of this writing, there doesn't seem to be any option for a player to take a wrestler they've created through the campaign mode. </p> <p>This doesn't mean there aren't any customisation options at all, though. Players can still create their own wrestlers, stables and arenas and the creation tools allow for some pretty zany results. Visually and sonically, the game is a step up from last year's iteration; wrestlers look more like their real-world counterparts and less like bulky shop mannequins and the match commentaries are less repetitive. The game's mechanics are also more solid; there's less chance this year of the game misinterpreting the player's commands and it's possible to counter an opponent without having the reflexes required to pluck flies out of the air with a pair of chopsticks.</p> <p>WWE 13 does feel like the bookend to an era, though. The game's referencing of the WWE's most successful period and the lack of a new engine feels more like a product of the fact that this generation of consoles is winding down than anything else. It may be that WWE 13 is a placeholder and better things are planned for the franchise once the next-gen machines rumble out of the gate. Still, it handles better than its predecessor, its creation tools are robust and its campaign mode is sure to rekindle nostalgia in long-time fans this coming November.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 WWE 13 will be released on PS3, Wii and Xbox 360 on 2 November</strong></p>",
  "<p>Exams are a bit like sex. There are countless ways in which we talk a lot about both topics in public. But they remain essentially private activities, ideally done on one's own in the case of exams (no cheating please) and not on one's own in the case of sex. Unless you're Prince Harry in Las Vegas it's just not a team sport. We'll put that <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-348436/I-didnt-finish-Harrys-painting-says-Eton-art-head.html\" title=\"\">controversy over Harry's A-level art result</a> to one side for today.</p> <p>So the annual agonising over exam results always puzzles me, not least because it mixes issues of public policy with the intimate \u2013 often painful \u2013 impact of individual grades. On A-level results day, then on GCSEs day, there's usually a photo of some thrilled kids (even progressive newspapers like pretty teenage girls) or of distressed youngsters comforting each other.</p> <p>It brings back ancient memories and makes me feel uncomfortable. It reminds me of the boy in my class who ran round the school playground crying \"I've passed\" because he'd read he'd been \"selected\" to go to the secondary modern school, when you could tell he had the wrong-sized 11-plus envelope in his hand. I checked years later, and he'd done well in life despite that failure.</p> <p>So the old way of doing things could be pretty cruel too, but at least it wasn't all over the newspapers and TV news. But ever since Jim Callaghan (prime minister from 1976 to 1979), who'd left school at 14 and therefore valued education, instituted a \"national debate\" on standards, the country has been fretting about how best to make sure the talent pool is nurtured and individual ability stretched.</p> <p>Has it been accompanied by a South Korean or Japanese obsession with working schoolchildren so hard to get into top universities that every year a few commit suicide? Not that I've noticed, and a good thing too. Asian tiger mothers overdo it. What I fear happens here is that the gap between parents who push and nurture their young in less oppressive ways and those who \u2013 as they might say \u2013 can't be arsed to bother with school has grown. It's an underclass problem, made worse by what health economists call \"the inverse care law\". Those who need most attention often get least and vice versa.</p> <p>Every year's media drama is different. This year it's Michael Gove's awkward attempt to reverse so-called grade inflation, the creeping up of GCSE and A-level results year on year at a time when <a href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/inthenews/inthenews/a0070042/major-international-study-shows-englands-15-year-olds-performing-poorly-in-mathematics-science-and-reading\" title=\"\">international comparisons suggest that we are slipping </a> behind comparable nations \u2013 even in English, as well as maths and science.</p> <p>The whole question is fraught with ideological priorities, elitism versus egalitarianism never far below the surface. But we can surely agree with Gove when he argues that a system which sees improvement in results every year is in danger of being self-defeating. There's a good <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/23/missing-the-mark-gcse-grades\" title=\"\">letter</a> in Friday's Guardian explaining the difference between \"norm referencing\" (a similar proportion pass or fail each year) in exam marking and harder \"criterion referencing\", which judges candidates against specific criteria.</p> <p>The education secretary telling exam boards engaged in a competitive struggle for business to raise the bar sounds a bit like the Bank of England dropping heavy hints to commercial banks about how to do their business \u2013 liable to misunderstanding, deliberate or not \u2013 without setting out formal instructions.</p> <p>Overall the drop in this year's A-level and GCSE results is only modest, though the impact on <em>individuals</em> may be serious, as it may be for schools which fail to meet the 40% five A*-C <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jun/14/schools-told-raise-bar-gcse-results\" title=\"\">\"good\" passes threshold</a>. Teachers across England \u2013 it's an England-only row \u2013 were driven to reckless hyperbole on Friday by the way in which the new English GCSEs were marked, so that those judged in the first half of the year had an easier time than those judged later. Hence the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/23/gcse-results-exam-marking-school-outcry?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">record number of appeals, which Jeevan Vasagar writes about</a>.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/23/gcse-results-marks-schools-michael-gove?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">Guardian's editorial</a> highlights the fear that Gove will use the failure of some schools to match the 40% bar \u2013 English and maths are rightly deemed essential \u2013 to push or bribe them into academy status. That would surely be unfair. In any case academies are no more a panacea than other remedies for mediocre results. On Radio 4 this week I heard the head of a west London academy being interviewed, sensibly enough though innocent listeners might have imagined it to be located in a tough inner-city neighbourhood. Only later did I realise my own kids had attended it under a different name. Mediocre the school may have been at the time, but it was hardly deprived.</p> <p>The pernicious impact of the 40% bar \u2013 the law of unintended consequences as ever \u2013 is that some schools focus their effort on students close to the vital C grade in order to push more of them safely across it. It means \u2013 as so often \u2013 that both the bright students who will pass anyway and the stragglers get less attention. The FT's editorial helpfully suggests that if points were awarded for each GCSE or A-level grade to calculate a school's average, this ill effect could be avoided.</p> <p>The primary purpose of exams surely is to stretch and challenge young minds while teaching them things they should know. There is more emphasis now on teaching them how to study rather than mere content, and as an oldster I am suspicious of that. But I don't like the French emphasis on cramming facts \u2013 a very Victorian echo \u2013 either. It seems to be an enemy of creativity, though also, I suspect, a tool of better discipline.</p> <p>The other more utilitarian purpose is to allow higher education institutions and employers to judge what sort of people they may be taking on. Both have complained loudly in recent years that they are not getting enough youngsters with either the skills or work ethic they need. Hence the jobs given to older workers and to young Poles with degrees, I suspect. You find them working everywhere, don't you?</p> <p>So both the elitist and egalitarian camps have points to make \u2013 as in the Olympic debate a fortnight ago. Society needs to educate well as many young people as it can, for their good and ours, just as it needs to interest them in sport or other physically healthy activity. Exams don't suit some people, just as football doesn't suit others. The pentathlon or the 16 GCSE A*s achieved by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/23/gcse-results-students-marks?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Freya Smith </a>in Holmfirth (I'm afraid she couldn't manage better than: \"I'm over the moon\") aren't for everyone.</p> <p>But nurturing an elite \u2013 of mind and body \u2013 matters too and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/17/michael-gove-school-playing-fields\" title=\"\">Gove's lax attitude towards school playing field sales </a>and sports funding shows he still hasn't grasped what it takes even to achieve his own priorities. Rarely have I read a more uplifting article than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/16/a-level-results-mo-farah-school?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Shiv Malik's report on how Mo Farah's old school </a>\u2013 in a much tougher corner of west London than my kids roamed \u2013 has addressed both challenges. If you read nothing else today check it out \u2013 especially the bit about NO EXCUSES.</p>",
  "<p>So no judge in a court of arbitration will ever be called to read sentence in the case of Lance Armstrong. But for anyone with eyes to see and ears to hear, the jury was never out.</p> <p>By <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/24/lance-armstrong-fight-doping-charges\">refusing to mount a defence in the US Anti-Doping Agency's case against him</a>, Lance Armstrong has \u2013 whatever equivocation and claims of persecution he persists in \u2013 all but conceded that he won his seven Tour de France titles by doping. And by walking away from a defence he has ceded those yellow jerseys and lost his status as the most remarkable serial winner in the history of the sport.</p> <p>There may be some small fraternity of true believers who still need the master-narrative of the heroic cancer survivor-turned-sports superstar and still cling to a conviction that he could have beaten the rap if the world had not conspired against him.</p> <p>Armstrong's statement repeats a familiar litany of disingenuous indignation \u2013 his record of wins, a lack of physical evidence, the \"nonsense\" of this \"witch-hunt\" and so on \u2013 but by this decision, Armstrong has excommunicated himself from the Church of Lance: he no longer believes in the plausibility of his own denials. The aggression that kept accusers in check and witnesses silent for so long has been replaced by weariness and resignation.</p> <p>\"There comes a point in every man's life when he has to say, 'Enough is enough.' For me, that time is now,\" his statement reads.</p> <p>Yet even a dope cheat still needs to be a master tactician to win the Tour de France: if Armstrong decided to quit the fight it was because this was the least worst option remaining to him. This pre-emptive retreat allows him to avoid the formal process of prosecution and conviction, and the humiliation that would have gone along with that. Perhaps his Livestrong foundation, and what remains of his tarnished brand, can thus survive in some netherworld of unreason.</p> <p>Where does that leave cycling? With many unresolved questions. We may never know who were all the former team-mates of Armstrong that USADA had ready to testify against him about the years of EPO use, steroids, blood-doping techniques and whatever else that delivered that unbroken string of Tour victories, though we can guess at their identities. And we will have to wait and see whether Armstrong's longtime team manager, Johan Bruyneel, will attempt a defence, though the percentage must be in his folding quietly and taking a ban.</p> <p>We may never finally know what deals were done to hush up the alleged positive tests Armstrong gave, though we have our suspicions. And we can only wonder who might now be deemed to have won the Tour de France from 1999 to 2005, though we must assume that the Tour authorities would rather award no result than attempt the fool's errand of seeking retrospectively a clean cyclist in the top 10 of any of those years.</p> <p>Better to look forward and learn. There is no doubt that the anti-doping agencies have won the upper hand since Lance Armstrong's heyday in the fight to rid the sport of performance-enhancing drugs. Many do still cheat, though they are fewer and more are caught. Teams keep sponsors by staying clean; they lose them when riders are discovered doping. The governing body, the UCI, has abandoned its shameful connivance of the EPO era.</p> <p>But there's no reason for complacency. It will only take a tangential advance in medical science for some new substance to become available for which there is no test; then the cheats will be ahead in the pharmacological arms race once more.</p> <p>The most important lesson of the Lance Armstrong story, though, is the hardest to prepare for and guard against: our own gullibility and willing complicity. What is astounding and disturbing is that one man \u2013 a dominant personality as well as a dominant athlete \u2013 was able to enforce his will, isolate, bully and silence his doubters and critics, and win the world's top cycling event year after year and make people believe in him, despite there being, apparently, dozens of witnesses to its utter phoniness. Too many people had too much invested in the Lance Armstrong story, and the power of persuasion followed the money.</p> <p>The moral of the story is that if a cyclist looks too good to be true, then he probably is. But if a cyclist looks too good to be true and has an entourage of lawyers, press flaks, doctors and bodyguards, then he definitely is.</p>",

Many of those most directly affected by the attacks had wanted Breivik judged of sound mind and sent to prison.</p> <p>During the hour after delivering the verdict, Breivik stared impassively at the panel of judges, blushing only when details of his fictional Knights Templar organisation were read out. The morning session has been spent largely describing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/24/anders-behring-breivik-profile-oslo\" title=\"\">Breivik's meticulous preparations for last year's twin attacks and how he became obsessed with far-right ideology and computer games.</a></p> <p>As details were read out of the injuries sustained by each of the 77 who died and the 242 wounded , Breivik stared across the room. The force of his 950kg Oslo bomb was soon starkly evident to the courtroom, as a number of victims suffered amputations and spent lengthy periods in a coma.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the court heard fresh details of the killings on Ut\u00f8ya. Breivik was described as acting \"frantic\" upon arriving on the island dressed as a police officer. At the time, 536 people had gathered on the island for the Labour party's annual summer camp.</p> <p>During a killing spree lasting over an hour, Breivik fired 121 shots with his pistol and 136 with a semi-automatic rifle. Many of the victims were executed with close-range shots to the head. One 26-year-old woman was shot six times, including a fatal shot to her head.</p> <p>Many young victims hyperventilated as they tried to flee. Earlier it had rained and many stumbled and fell on slippery slopes as they ran down to the water's edges in an attempt to escape.</p> <p>Emotional problems have been recorded among those who managed to survive and a number of teenagers remain unable to study and are on sick leave, the court heard.</p> <p>Breivik is almost certain to end his life in prison. Although Norway has a maximum prison sentence of 21 years, Breivik could be sentenced to \"preventive detention\", which can be extended for as long as an inmate is considered dangerous to society.</p> <p>The verdict of the most high-profile criminal trial in Norway since Nazi collaborators were prosecuted following the second world war is certain to provoke a strong response.</p> <p>Most Norwegians, including the victims' families, had wanted Breivik to be found sane so he could be held accountable for what they view as a political crime.</p> <p>The decision also means there will be no appeal. Breivik's lawyer, Geir Lippestad, promised the gunman will not contest a jail sentence.</p> <p>Breivik has readily admitted carrying out the twin attacks that shocked the famously peaceful country on 22 July 2011.</p> <p>After setting off a car bomb outside government headquarters in Oslo, Breivik went on a shooting rampage on Ut\u00f8ya.</p> <p>Eight people died in the bombing and 69 \u2013 34 of them aged between 14 and 17 \u2013 were killed on the island.</p> <p>The gunman, who has shown no remorse throughout his 10-week trial, has described how he reloaded his semi-automatic rifle while victims sat waiting for him to kill them.</p> <p>The decision overrides the findings of a report by court-appointed psychiatrists submitted before the start of the trial, which claimed Breivik suffered from paranoid schizophrenia.</p> <p>That claim, if it had been accepted by the court, would have relieved Breivik of his legal responsibility for the crime and ensured his detention in a specially built psychiatric unit inside Ila prison, just outside Oslo.</p> <p>He will still serve his sentence in the same jail, where he has been held in isolation for most of the time since his arrest.</p> <p>It is understood he could challenge a preventive detention sentence every five years.</p> <p>One of the reasons Breivik's attacks were presented in such graphic detail during the trial was so that the horror of Oslo and Ut\u00f8ya would be well-documented for the day Breivik asks to be released.</p>",
  "<p>In case you live in a cave and missed the story, last weekend Prince Harry was spotted getting wet and wild with dozens of bosom buddies at the alcohol-fuelled pool parties in Las Vegas. Over the past few days it's been hard to ignore all the pap shots of him getting on down at the Wynn Hotel's XS nightclub, challenging American Olympic champion swimmer Ryan Lochte to a race in his jeans, and wearing a \"let's get wild\" vest belonging to someone called Lauren's bachelorette party.</p> <p>Well, if it's good enough for British royalty, it's good enough for me, and in fact I was one step ahead of the party prince, having visited the city's pool party scene earlier this summer.</p> <p>The Vegas pool party concept launched in 2004 with the original day club, Rehab at the Hard Rock Hotel, and is now the focal point of wild weekends for America's youth, in much the same way as young Brits descend upon Magaluf or Mykonos. The craze has taken off in recent years, with all the major hotels along the strip now boasting party pools.</p> <p>I had a few concerns. It wasn't just the possibility of booze-sozzled drowning, and getting wrinkly fingers. \"Where do these party people go when they need a wee?\" my mother had asked. A valid point, but not one that lingered in my mind as I reclined in the 40C heat on my sunbed at Encore (another club where Harry partied), mojito in hand, nodding my head to the skittering electronic beats cascading from the two-metre high speaker stacks across a scene that brought to mind the saying \"only in America\".</p> <p>Cocktail waitresses with six-inch stilettos, pearly white smiles and tiny bikinis walked by, carrying trays laden with pitchers of frozen margarita. A six-foot, six-packed beefcake bellowed into my face that his wife would like to take a picture with me. Well, fine, you don't have to shout. Sun-kissed girls gyrated to the music, arms raised, saluting the blue skies. Resident DJ Morgan Page scrutinised his Mac Notebook and blended one heavily remixed chart hit into another. My natural instinct was to find a quiet spot away from the din to tune in to Test Match Special on long wave. But this was Vegas. They've never even heard of cricket. It was time to put the Englishness on hold. Before I knew it, somebody had tossed me a rubber ring, handed me a rubber duck filled with Bacardi and pinched my bottom. Then I was floating away into a writhing mass of oiled bodies.</p> <p>Las Vegas weekends usually revolve around nighttime forays into a hedonistic world. Casinos don't have windows or clocks on the walls, so weary punters don't know it's time to hit the hay, and just keep on pumping money into the slot machines. Lately, however, they've discovered a new way of partying, and one that doesn't lead to vitamin D deficiency \u2013 it's called day clubbing.</p> <p>My pool odyssey began at the Marquee day club at the Cosmopolitan hotel, on a terrace packed with sunbeds, Jacuzzis, liposuctioned bodies and a moderately sized pool, overlooked by palm trees and glitzy 60-storey hotels, iridescent in the sun. After walking there through the hot desert winds, from my suite at the stylish Vdara hotel (with views of the Strip and the hills of the Mojave desert), I was glad to jump straight into the pool. At its edge, as well as $500-a-day sunloungers, Grand Cabanas are available for $3,500-$5,000 a day. These soft-seated chillout zones seat up to 15 people; they are open sided, with sun shades, flatscreen TVs, minibars loaded with beer, water and soft drinks, and private infinity pools. A pitcher of margarita or mojito costs $48, a beer or bottle of water $8.</p> <p>Kaskade, in the DJ booth, banged out standard Vegas fare \u2013 US chart meets Balearic-style beats and soaring synths \u2013 but the music was really just a background soundtrack to the people-watching. And unlike in, say, Paris or St Tropez, at Vegas pool parties people look around to check whether other people are looking back at them. And it was the men, rather than the women, who were the real attention- seekers. The dress code for the guys is long Bermuda shorts and taut, rippled torsos. For women it's micro bikinis, wedges and tattoos. Shades obligatory.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395164047\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/8/23/1345714602093/Union-jack-the-lad---Josh-001.jpg\" alt=\"Union jack the lad \u2026 Joshua makes friends at the poolside\" width=\"460\" height=\"331\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Union jack the lad \u2026 Joshua makes friends at the poolside</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I asked the manager whether he sees wild stuff happening here. \"Oh yeah, we positively encourage it.\" Drugs? I ask. \"Oh, no, drugs aren't allowed.\" Sex? \"No sex either.\" I wonder if he's just being on message \u2026 I'm pretty sure that boy and girl over by the palm trees aren't just shaking hands \u2026</p> <p>In contrast to Marquee's laidback but expensive vibes, the mayhem at Encore Beach Club was mind-blowing. With 1,000 people in attendance on any given Sunday (swelling to its 3,000-capacity on a big holiday weekend) this sprawling mass was something to behold. In the booth next to us, six scantily clad 40-something all-American gals told me they visited every year to have some time away from their husbands and show off their tummy tucks, boob jobs and belly-button piercings.</p> <p>Around us, a huge crowd fell about, drinks in hand, posing, flirting, laughing and grinding like extras on a Yo! MTV Raps video shoot. Around the DJ booth, stick-on tattoos of the DJ, Morgan Page, were in evidence. Kids were going wild. Even the lifeguards were bopping their heads.</p> <p>Where does Page rank among the international DJs that come to Vegas, I asked Shaun, a seasoned dayclubber from Ohio. He fired off a list of big names: Ti\u00ebsto, Deadmau5, SkyBlu from LMFAO, Benny Benassi \u2013 they all play here on the big weekends, and clubbers need to book ahead for these. Memorial Day at the end of May is the biggest weekend, but Labor Day in September and Spring Break are traditionally frantic.</p> <p>On a normal day, Encore entry costs $50 for men and $40 for women, but those doing it in style will get a big group together and hire an upper-tier bungalow, for $15,000 to $30,000 a day. This includes a private pool party and a vista from on high of an ocean of writhing bodies.</p> <p>Sundays are the big day for pool parties, and Wet Republic at the MGM Grand \u2013 where Prince Harry was spotted \u2013 is one of the biggest. When I arrived, the army of bouncers at the door appeared to be in the midst of an almighty power trip. One was complaining that all the \"hoes\" in the \"line-up\" (queue) were \"pissing him off\". His colleague suggested he take a break. He should try working a Friday night at Oceana in Watford.</p> <p>While door policies are no more restrictive than at nightclubs back home, and you're unlikely to be turned away, Mark Kmetz, a promoter at Liquid day club at the Aria hotel, told me the best bet for a guaranteed good weekend is to ring your hotel before arriving and book a senior host or promoter for your stay, to guarantee smooth entry to all the clubs and reserved sun loungers. Vegas is many things, but it is not restrictive: if you go there to party you'll be welcomed.</p> <p>Inside, there were plenty of washboard stomachs on display, and flab too. However, the cabanas overlooking the pool and main stage were populated with what can only be described as supermodels and sports stars. A contestant from US TV show The Bachelor was partying hard in the pool, surrounded by a harem of girls.</p> <p>What to do amid such a scene? Float in the pool, dance to DJ Bad Boy Bill's set of hip-hop classics, have a water-pistol fight? Or simply hire a daybed (which accommodates three to four people), sip my Corona and take it all in. I wouldn't be seeing this back in Southend-on-Sea.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Visit Las Vegas (</em><a href=\"http://www.visitlasvegas.co.uk\" title=\"\"><em>visitlasvegas.co.uk)</em></a><em> provided the trip.

  "<p>The family of a Muslim man whose doctors attempted to withdraw treatment after a heart attack left him with severe brain damage say they feel vindicated after dramatic video evidence emerged in court that suggested he may not be in a vegetative state.</p> <p>The footage recorded on Wednesday night \u2013 and witnessed by a doctor \u2013 shows the 55-year-old Muslim man, known as L, responding to requests and commands.</p> <p>A neurologist at the court of protection in London concluded L was in a minimally conscious state and could not rule out the possibility of further progress and even verbal communication.</p> <p>Relatives of the man, from Greater Manchester, have been fighting a decision by the Pennine Acute Hospitals Trust that L was beyond recovery after his third heart attack five weeks ago. His doctors had sought an assurance from the court that they did not have to resuscitate him or put him on a ventilator should his condition become life-threatening.</p> <p>In a dramatic twist on Thursday as the case was about to conclude, L's family produced video evidence to the court and the case was adjourned by Mr Justice Moylan until 1 October.</p> <p>The family's solicitor, Helen Lewis, an expert in clinical negligence at Manchester law firm Pannone said: \"The family feel vindicated in contesting the trust's application, but even more importantly they are relieved that medically L is not in a vegetative state and there is hope of recovery.</p> <p>\"They have asked for their privacy to be respected in the weeks and months ahead as they concentrate on assisting L to make as full a recovery as possible.\" She said they now await response from the trust as to how their clinicians \"reconsider their position in the light of this new and dramatic evidence\".</p> <p>Lewis added: \"It is certainly a sobering thought that the trust would have put in place a 'do not resuscitate' order if the family had not challenged their stance through the legal system.\"</p> <p>L's family strongly opposed the hospital's stance, telling the court they did not believe he was beyond hope of recovery and that their religion, Islam, required that everything possible should be done to keep L alive.</p> <p>An independent neurologist, Dr Peter Newman, who had been due to give evidence in support of the hospital, was shown video that he said demonstrated L was no longer in a persistent vegetative state.A trust doctor gave a witness statement in which he accepted that there was \"a closing of eyes and grimacing\" when L's eyes were cleaned.</p> <p>On Thursday, Jenni Richards QC, for the family, told Moylan the video was shot during a visit to the hospital on Wednesday night by the family in the company of a hospital doctor, who was not a neurologist.</p> <p>\"That video footage was viewed this morning by Dr Newman as well as by representatives of the family,\" Richards told the court. \"On the basis of what he had seen on the video footage, Dr Newman's view, shared with all the parties, was that Mr L was no longer in a persistent vegetative state.\"</p> <p>It was Newman's position that he was now \"most likely in a minimally conscious state\", said Richards. \"He accepts the video footage shows, as the family said, some purposeful responses \u2013 some sentient responses \u2013 on a different level from those that have previously been observed.\"</p> <p>Richards said L could possibly improve further and that Newman did not rule out the possibility eventually of \"some verbal communication\".</p> <p>Claire Watson, for the hospital trust, said there had clearly been some change in the diagnosis. She did not yet have \"a definitive view from the treating clinicians at the hospital whether or not that will alter their care plan for L\", but she thought it was unlikely to do so, given the severity of L's brain damage.</p> <p>Earlier in the week, before the new evidence emerged, the court heard that the family \"wanted to believe\" that he was able to respond and the medical opinion was there was no chance of a meaningful recovery. However, the video contradicted this evidence.</p>",

  "<p>In Sweden, the trend towards supporting more social entrepreneurs and greater social innovation has visibly gained pace during recent years. Due in part to a shift in public perception, this form of entrepreneurship with societal benefits is fast gaining recognition as an important constituent in the development of a sustainable society \u2013 in ecological, social and financial terms.</p> <p>There has, of course, always been a presence of organisations with good purposes and enthusiasts with good hearts. But developments in information technology and the digitalisation of media have created new possibilities for these enthusiasts, at the same time as climate threats, global injustices and financial crises have created the urgent need for new, creative solutions.</p> <p>A Swedish example when it comes to injustices in our society is for instance <a href=\"http://socialinnovation.se/en/hopeful-staffing/\" title=\"\">Hopeful Staffing</a>, the world's first agency for homeless people. Fighting climate threats is for instance <a href=\"http://adoptabee.se/blog/in-english/\" title=\"\">Adopt a bee \u2013 Honey for free</a>. <a href=\"http://www.solvatten.se/\" title=\"\">Solvatten</a> (translated; \"Sunwater\"), is a business who has invented a household water treatment unit, which saves lives.</p> <p>In Sweden, social entrepreneurship is generally understood as an entrepreneurship whose core activity not only generates income for its owner and employees, but also in a visible and preferably accountable way provides a positive impact on individuals and society: locally, regionally or globally. As a result of the financial and administrative support which enables the establishment of different networks for social innovations, several interesting arenas have arisen.</p> <p>Most platforms of this kind serve the purpose of supporting research, knowledge and competence within the growing areas of social innovation and social entrepreneurship, often consisting of concrete, mutual projects and new sustainable models of business where innovative products and services are developed. Ideas-driven and ruled by principles, the social entrepreneur in Sweden focuses on activity which allows for the possibility of enlargement from local to global level \u2014 activity that changes structures in its foundation and re-invests profit. These entrepreneurs are found in \"new business\" \u2014 within sustainable technology, within the \"new public service\" for people who are excluded, with the \"new NGOs\" \u2014 where business logic is used to enhance effectiveness and benefit the activity.</p> <p>An interesting Danish example of new business, also with focus on global injustice, can be found in <a href=\"http://www.baisikeli.dk/\" title=\"\">Baisikeli</a>, who focuses on expanding cycling culture in both Denmark and developing countries. <a href=\"http://kladoteket.se/\" title=\"\">Kl\u00e4doteket</a> (translated; \"Clothetique\"), is a business which works as a library for funny and unique clothes.</p> <p>Currently, Sweden is considering the balance between governmental/municipal control and governmental/municipal support \u2014 a relationship that may be <a href=\"http://www.naringsbloggen.se/innovation/\" title=\"\">most evident in a blog that is driven by the government</a> (the ministry of enterprise, energy and communications), in which both officials and guest bloggers have the opportunity to contribute their thoughts and opinions on \"the way to the new innovation strategy in Sweden\". The new innovation strategy has yet to arrive in Sweden, \u2014 this much is made clear in the blog \u2014 but what does this say about the current policy? Politicians and officials assign themselves the authority to create a strategy that clearly would be best developed by social entrepreneurs. Social innovation in its true sense is initiative taken by social entrepreneurs in order to address something in society they believe needs to be changed or improved.</p> <p>Social innovation can serve as the driving force in solving these persistent social and economic problems. The social entrepreneur may even work across borders to break up existing structures. That public institutions do not find it easy to renew themselves is expected, and as it should be, but in recognising this they must \"keep their fingers away\" from social innovation, instead giving maximum support to the movements and phenomena whose very purpose is to create a better society. Rephrasing David Bornstein and Susan Davis (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Social-Entrepreneurship-What-Everyone-Needs/dp/0195396332\" title=\"\">Social Entrepreneurship: What Everyone Needs to Know</a>); the public institutions should act like a gardener, and not as a builder.</p> <p>Sweden and neighbouring countries have played host to a number of relevant conferences in recent years, and this autumn will see the conference <a href=\"http://www.euclidnetwork.eu/about-us/euclid-network-annual-conference-2012.html\" title=\"\">Bridging the Gap \u2013 New Survival Strategies</a> be held in Malmo and Copenhagen. Scheduled for the 24-25 September, the concept compares the slow, dependent cow with the adaptable, independent squirrel. Through this metaphor, it is argued that the most effective social innovations are cultivated by self-organised, independent and adaptable social entrepreneurs. This is an important focus for the Europe of today, affected by financial crises, demographic changes, challenges with public health, migration and climate changes.</p> <p><em>Dr Sophia L\u00f6vgren is a board member at both the </em><a href=\"http://www.euclidnetwork.eu/\" title=\"\"><em>Euclid Network</em></a><em> and the </em><a href=\"http://\" title=\"\"><em>Ideell Arena</em></a><em> and is secretary general of </em><a href=\"http://www.euclidnetwork.eu/about-us/euclid-network-annual-conference-2012.html\" title=\"\"><em>Remarkable Parents in Sweden</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.euclidnetwork.eu/about-us/euclid-network-annual-conference-2012.html\" title=\"\"><em>Bridging the Gap \u2013 New Survival Strategies</em></a><em>, organised by Euclid Network and its local partners Social+ and KPH Projects alongside the Forum for Social Innovation Sweden,, will take place from the 24th \u2014 25th September 2012.

If newspapers can't participate in that, it asks questions of where print and online go.\"</p> <p>Murdoch, who is chair of the TV production company Shine, which is owned by News Corp, was talking in a formal question and answer session on Friday morning at the Edinburgh International TV Festival after giving the festival keynote speech on Thursday night.</p> <p>She said she felt the prince had been stitched up by the young woman who snapped the shots of him cavorting naked in Las Vegas. \"I feel sad for him \u2013 take the mobile phones away; he's a young guy having fun.\"</p> <p>Around 60 complaints have been made to the press watchdog about the Sun pictures.</p> <p>The Press Complaints Commission (PCC) said all the complaints came from members of the public and none had come from St James's Palace or any other representatives of the prince.</p> <p>The palace said it had no further comment on the matter.</p> <p>The Sun's decision to publish had come after Prince Charles's aides threatened legal action against newspapers if they published the images, even though they had already been circulated online.</p> <p>One of the two pictures of Harry naked is splashed across the paper's front page with the headline: \"Heir it is!\", a day after a male reporter and a female intern posed in a mock-up.</p> <p>In an editorial, the Sun claimed there was a \"clear public interest\" in publishing the photographs \"in order for the debate around them to be fully informed\".</p> <p>It added: \"The photos have potential implications for the prince's image representing Britain around the world.</p> <p>\"There are questions over his security during the Las Vegas holiday. Questions as to whether his position in the army might be affected. Further, we believe Harry has compromised his own privacy.\"</p> <p>The grainy mobile phone pictures of the prince's antics were first published online by TMZ early on Wednesday.</p> <p>Clarence House confirmed their authenticity but royal aides moved quickly to warn British media organisations not to republish the embarrassing photographs, with newspapers complying until the Sun broke ranks on Thursday night.</p> <p>A Press Complaints Commission spokesman said on Thursday: \"This was an editorial decision taken by the Sun. Should the PCC receive a complaint, it will investigate it following normal procedures.\"</p> <p>The Sun's managing editor, David Dinsmore, said the paper had \"thought long and hard\" about whether to use the pictures and said it was an issue of freedom of the press rather than because it was moralising about Harry's actions.</p> <p>He said: \"This is about the ludicrous situation where a picture can be seen by hundreds of millions of people around the world on the internet, but can't be seen in the nation's favourite paper read by 8 million people every day.</p> <p>\"This is about our readers getting involved in discussion with the man who's third in line to the throne, it's as simple as that.\"</p> <p>There was a mixed reaction to the publication of the photos. Media lawyer Mark Stephens said: \"There is no public interest in publishing these pictures, even the Sun can't come up with a public interest in publishing these pictures, and the fact that they are available in foreign media doesn't make English law any less applicable. They have broken the law cynically, and obviously with a view to obtaining publicity.\"</p> <p>Former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott said: \"The Sun's actions proves that as of this morning, self-regulation is now dead. This [story] is not in public interest, it is in the self-interest of Murdoch to earn money by breaching the privacy of anyone he wants, to sell his newspapers.</p> <p>\"The argument that just because it is all over the internet is spurious at least. There are lots of offensive images and extreme material on the web which international papers don't print.\"</p> <p>But Louise Mensch, a Conservative member of the culture committee, said: \"There is a clear, demonstrable public interest: the royal family receives money from the civil list; Prince Harry in inviting people to his room [had] the expectation of privacy so there's questions of judgment and questions of security.\"</p>",

  "<p>How would you like to die? If that sounds more like a Bond villain's threat than a question, it should tell you something about the strange attitudes that persist towards mortality. Death is the certain destination for all of us, yet most of us go through daily life without any reference to it at all. Even when someone's clearly near the limits of life, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/22/tony-nicklinson-right-to-die-case?newsfeed\\u003dtrue\" title=\"\">Tony Nicklinson</a> was, it's treated as strange or perverse that they should seek to control their own end. This denial is understandable but ludicrous all the same, because when we refuse to acknowledge the unavoidable approach of death, we allow ourselves to drift towards fates that are more terrible than nothingness: final days of helplessness, pain, loneliness and confusion, often drawn out to excruciating lengths in strange places.</p> <p>For most people when pressed, the answer to my question is probably something like \"peacefully in my own bed\". Yet even that small wish of being at home is unlikely to be fulfilled: 58% of all deaths occur in hospital, <a href=\"http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/sites/default/files/national_care_of_the_dying_audit_-_hospitals_exec_summary.pdf\" title=\"PDF\">according to the Royal College of Physicians</a>. I've had my life saved in hospital a few times, and am enormously grateful to the NHS for it, but I've also been enormously grateful to come home. A hospital is where you go to get better, not the place you should spend the rest of your life, inhaling a mix of antiseptic and other people's bedpan smells with your last breaths.</p> <p>That means that, while I think palliative plans such as the <a href=\"http://www.liv.ac.uk/mcpcil/liverpool-care-pathway/\" title=\"\">Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient</a> (LCP) \u2013 designed to direct end-of-life care in institutional settings less towards prolonging existence, and more towards respecting the patient's wishes to ensure their comfort and dignity to the end \u2013 are mostly a good thing, I also think it's fundamentally misguided to focus only on hospitals or hospices. You shouldn't wait until a patient is at the very verge of death before consulting them on how they'd like to die. That's a bit like waiting until a pregnant woman is 9cm dilated before you ask her to sketch out a birth plan, and then ignoring her wishes anyway because she's in extremis and probably isn't thinking straight \u2013 an experience too common to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/29/old-dear-language-elderly-people\" title=\"\">elderly patients who find themselves patronised or overlooked</a>.</p> <p>Why isn't a death plan part of our regular discussions with our GPs? I don't mean that doctors should assail us with memento moris every time we swing by the waiting room for a flu jab. But in the same way that we're encouraged to make a will before it becomes a pressing need, it would make sense if every so often \u2013 during your annual check-up, say \u2013 the doctor or nurse ran through a few general questions while they weigh you and take your blood pressure. Have you thought about donating your organs? Do you want treatment withdrawn if you're left in a persistent vegetative state? And if you hope to die contentedly in your own bed after a long life well-lived, how are you going to help make that happen?</p> <p>People might be a bit touchy at first about this conversational turn, but they shouldn't be. The same things that help to ensure a good death can ensure a good life, too. If you exercise regularly to improve your cardiovascular fitness, maintain your muscle mass and promote strong bones, your body will stay stronger for longer, and help you avoid the dreaded old-age fall that lands you in hospital where you contract a bladder infection and die with your urethra on fire. If you don't smoke and don't drink too much, you're less susceptible to the grim effects of a stroke that can rob you of both independence and personality.</p> <p>There are metaphysical benefits to living your life with a pragmatic acceptance of your own death too, as Oliver Burkeman tells us in his book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Antidote-Happiness-Positive-Thinking/dp/1847678645\" title=\"\">The Antidote</a>: \"[T]here is a positive correlation between the fear of death and the sense of an unlived life. Live a life suffused with a sense of its own finitude and you can hope to finish it in something like the fashion Jean-Paul Sartre hoped to die: 'quietly \u2026 certain that the last burst of my heart would be inscribed on the last page of my work, and that death would be taking only a dead man'.\" Or if you're really fortunate, you'll get something like Maurice Sendak's hoped-for \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/02/maurice-sendak-interview\" title=\"\">yummy death</a>\", where you stand up and sing before the soft dark takes you.</p> <p>And when, despite your clean living efforts, your health starts to falter anyway, you and your doctor will be well-placed to make the right decisions for you based on a lifetime of planning for the best possible end. That means you have a better chance of avoiding the twin horrors of over-intervention and under-communication that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/22/love-grandmother-wish-allowed-to-die\" title=\"\">elderly patients are subjected to</a>, when doctors struggle to maintain life way beyond a comfortable four-score-and-ten. As my grandma said, after a particularly badly managed course of treatment: \"They can give you all these pills but they can't make you young again.\" If we stop asking for impossible immortality and instead embrace the inevitable \u2013 not just individually, but within families, communities and the whole medical profession \u2013 we might find that death doesn't have to be all that terrible after all.</p>",

Any chance that you could remain impartial when blogging and writing match reports?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17881680\">Amy replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Just to put you in the picture of how most national media operate, there tends to be certain journalists assigned certain teams to follow. Logistically it makes sense not to have people criss crossing the country, and in theory, the idea is that if one person has a speciality with a certain club, they have better contacts, are more able to have a bigger picture outlook beyond the boundaries of one game or press conference, and can chart a team/player/manager's development. Being more informed ideally gives someone more expertise.</p> <p>Regards the question of impartiality, I have always found the idea that journalists are supposed to have nothing to do with being a supporter specious. Most of us lucky enough to do this job are passionate about football, and most people who are passionate about football get affiliated to a team at a young age. That doesn't mean you are biased when you are doing your job. Just because Robbie Fowler supported Everton as a kid doesn't mean he couldn't play in a Merseyside derby.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>1.08pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17879541\">cantthinkofagoodname</a></strong> wants to know what we all want to know: <strong>\"Who is the Secret Footballer?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17881731\">Amy replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I casually asked one day a while ago but was told in no uncertain terms the identity would not be revealed even to us on the inside.

The question is how? I'd imagine a 4-2-3-1 would be interesting, with Van Persie up front, and Kagawa, Rooney and Nani/Welbeck supporting. Not sure too many defenders would enjoy facing that.</p> <p>As for Swansea, they were a joy to watch last week. I have to admit that I was a little sceptical about how Laudrup would put his imprint on the team built by Rodgers, but that was fairly emphatically answered last weekend.

It is all very well filling the midfield with passers but, even if you take Barcelona as the role model - and nobody passes quite like them - they still need Busquets, and even the most technical players are brilliant at pressing.

  "<p>The fascinating question of how homing pigeons <a href=\"http://www.pigeonnavigation.com/\">navigate so successfully</a> has been raised again by the failure of 219 birds to get safely back to Scotland after a mass release at the weekend.</p> <p>Only 13 of the original release at Thirsk on the plain of York on Saturday returned to Galashiels, causing a fresh crop of headlines about the supposed 'Bermuda Triangle for birds' along the line of the A1M motorway between North Yorkshire, the Pennine spine and Consett in county Durham.</p> <p>This is not as freaky as it sounds. The mass of theory about pigeon (and other bird) navigation has long recognised the fact that there appear to be small areas where the system goes hopelessly wrong. Here's an exchange, for instance, on NBC's Today programme in the United States <a href=\"http://archives.nbclearn.com/portal/site/k-12/flatview?cuecard=40136\">as long ago as 1988</a>.</p> <p>Robert Bazell, science correspondent:</p> <blockquote> <p>One of the main systems is magnetism, but it turns out that there are places on the earth that are like little Bermuda Triangles, if a pigeon goes there it gets completely lost, can never find its way home.</p> </blockquote> <p>Bob Costas, anchor:</p> <blockquote> <p>And apart from this remarkable ability, they're really kind of dumb, huh?</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Bazell:</p> <blockquote> <p>Oh they're really stupid except they sure can find home.</p> </blockquote> <p>Except these 219 couldn't and most of them, presumably, are pecking about at the ample grain in the vast fields which lie between the Yorkshire Dales and the North York Moors. Where they are not alone. Keith Simpson, of the East Cleveland federation of pigeon fanciers, says that hundreds of others have failed to clear the area, with some enthusiasts losing half their birds.</p> <p>Scottish pigeon racer Austin Lindores tells the <em><a href=\"http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/\">Northern Echo </a></em>in Darlington, which comes into the triangle and famously used to have its own pigeon with an<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2002/oct/24/northerner.martinwainwright\"> online coo facility</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>When they fly down to the Thirsk,Wetherby and Consett area we call it the Bermuda Triangle because something always seems to happen.I won't be racing there again.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395145174\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/01/11/pl2.jpg\" alt=\"A plane leaves a vapour trail as it passes in front of the sun over London.\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This helps, when it deigns to shine.

  "<p>I've come across a few people recently who grow strawberries. I don't mean farmers or allotment&#xa0;gardeners \u2013 just city dwellers who have a tiny patch of earth or terrace. I'm inspired and encouraged. If they can do it, so can I. Even if it's only in a pot. Strawberries are the archetypal seasonal British fruit. Pert and red and bursting with juice, with a sweet, fragrant scent. Even the most clever chemists haven't been able to recreate these characteristics artificially. Of course, the peak of strawberry taste is the Frais de Bois \u2013 wild strawberry \u2013 an intense balance of sweetness, acidity and deep floral flavour. They are small enough to fit on a doll's house table but just one will fill your mouth with the most extraordinary delight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395149406\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/24/1345802420523/strawbs.jpg\" alt=\"strawberries\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Strawberries never fail to please children, whether freshly picked or whipped into some sweet dessert. I infused my (market-bought) strawberries with (home-grown) lemon verbena and sieved them to make a simple jelly. A wobbly pleasure to eat, especially&#xa0;for the&#xa0;children who&#xa0;demolished it.&#xa0;But next year, when I've grown my own, I think I'll just eat them straight from the plant.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395149407\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/24/1345802304587/jelly.jpg\" alt=\"jelly\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>STRAWBERRY AND LEMON VERBENA JELLY<br>The delicate fragrance of lemon verbena makes a simple strawberry jelly taste even better. Because strawberries don't make a transparent jelly, this still looks pretty served in a little glass or teacup, with fresh fruit sprinkled on top. As an alternative , you could use mint leaves or crushed lemongrass. Makes 4 jellies each measuring about 170ml</p> <p>800g strawberries, chopped into small pieces<br>250g caster sugar<br>juice of 1 lemon <br>10 leaves lemon verbena<br>7 leaves gelatine (check the instructions on the packet, too, as some brands are different \u2013 I usually use 1 leaf for every 100ml)</p> <p>In a pan, heat the strawberries with the sugar, lemon juice and lemon verbena . Bring the liquid to the boil, simmer gently for a minute for the strawberries to soften. Turn off the heat and let it sit for a few minutes to infuse.</p> <p>Strain the strawberry mixture through a sieve into a measuring jug, pushing as much of the pulp through as you can. If this creates lots of foam on top, you can scoop it off with a spoon to make a clearer jelly. </p> <p>Measure the quantity of liquid (it should be around 700ml) and soak as many gelatine leaves as required for that amount (see directions on the packet, although I find it's usually 1 leaf for every 100ml).</p> <p>Put the leaves in a bowl and cover with cold water for 5 minutes so they become soft and wobbly.</p> <p>Squeeze out liquid from the leaves and add to the strawberries. Put the mixture back into the pan and heat gently to dissolve the gelatine.</p> <p>Pour the mixture into the jelly mould or individual moulds and allow to cool then refrigerate to set. This will take at least 3 hours, or you can leave them overnight, but remember, the longer you leave it, the more set it will become.</p>",

The largest of its kind in Europe, it is an opportunity for the biggest names in the climbing world to promote their work through the time honored tradition of 'the lecture'. </p> <p>At these gatherings, rugged outdoor types wearing the apparel of the off piste climber - T-shirts, jeans and expensive approach shoes - hunker down in the auditorium to listen to their heroes expand on their latest expedition or read extracts from their new tome. Dutifully, they laugh and slap their thighs when Benedict Rugrat-Smyth strays into humour territory, gasp on cue when their hero flashes up an image of partner Barnaby's frost bitten toes or waiting patiently at the end of the talk for their signed copy of <em>K2: I did it my way</em>.</p> <p>For <a href=\"http://www.johnredhead.org/John_Redhead/Statement.html\">John Redhead</a>, who remains one of the UK's most enigmatic climbers, The 2012 KMF will not be a gathering where he will be seen or heard. And not surprisingly, given that an appearance he made at Kendal in the late 1990s has become almost the stuff of legend. Many of the earnest, muscular climbers who had come to hear of his exploits on rock ended up fighting for the exits like the steerage section on the <em>Titanic</em>, while those who remained witnessed a battle between hecklers and Redhead's volume control. When I asked him about 'the Kendal Gig' he explained:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Oh yes, the 'Kendal Gig'! What is it about the outdoor sector and creativity? Is sport an enemy of art? I guess the punters wanted to hear the big names talk about moves and numbers instead of ideas and possibilities. My show was based on the rites and considerations of the 'hunt', like being in a state of grace where all parties are involved. </p> <p>I treated the subject very much like the sacred ground before a climb. This is not Pepsi-Max culture, and not something most climbers would want to pay money to hear. But that's what they got, as I turned up the volume to counteract the yells of abuse. Kendal is the epitome of the redneck mainstream climber festival. I gave the same show at Bangor University and stayed for hours afterwards having meaningful dialogue and discussion on the poetry and issues involved.</p> </blockquote> <p>Born on the flat east coast of Yorkshire, John Redhead began his climbing career in the chalk quarries of Hessle but soon gravitated towards getting his exposure fix by climbing buildings. During one early ascent up the 14-storey Hull Royal Infirmary, the Queen, who happened to be visiting the town that day, had her route diverted by security officials in case the unknown climber was a terrorist. Another early ascent, described by Redhead as 'his scariest climbing experience ever', was a solo ascent of a giant cooling tower in the district.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395132734\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/23/1345757289822/john1.jpg\" alt=\"john redhead\" width=\"140\" height=\"183\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Redhead at north Wales' legendary climbers caff, Pete's Eats. Photograph: John Appleby.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After studying art and pursuing a career as a multi-media artist, he spent time living and working at the Pig Yard Museum in Settle before moving to the bright lights of the west coast and settling into a warehouse near Liverpool city centre. His artistic career at the time was developing in parallel to his astonishing development as a rock climber. The early 1980s had witnessed a series of breakthrough climbs on North Wales rock which were at the technical limits of the day in the UK. Even top climbers like Yorkshire's Pete Livesey and Ron Fawcett saw such Redhead routes as Margins of the mind, The Bells, the Bells' and 'The Cad' as 'big ticks' on their CV.</p> <p>However Redhead's rise to the top of the UK climbing tree was always on his own terms and his reputation as an <em>enfant terrible</em> was further cemented by his choice of ribald and pathological route names which by now he was increasing using for his first ascents. Names which climbing poet and intellectual David Craig described as 'horrible to my mind' in a radio programme, given their distance from his view that climbing should be a celebration of nature. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395132735\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/23/1345757336651/john2.jpg\" alt=\"john redhead\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Out in his north Wales playground, bouldering on Llanberis Pass. Photograph: John Redhead.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By this time - the late 1980s - Redhead's Welsh excursions were being launched from his Liverpool warehouse set in the decaying, and sometimes crime-blighted inner city heartlands: a dark underbelly where as the workers and industries moved out, prostitutes, drug dealers and junkies moved in. There was a mutual fascination between the bohemian artist and those who inhabited the darker fringes of city life. It was an area, he explained:</p> <blockquote> <p>where I had no choice but to be associated with some dealers and gangsters operating in the area. My studio was in the most central position in Liverpool, I witnessed the primaeval hunt in the streets below every Saturday night - a special perch for an artist to witness a city life exposed.</p> </blockquote> <p>It was during this time in Liverpool that he made a celebrated ascent of the tower of the city's Anglican cathedral. A solo ascent which he named 'The Apostles', was carried out as a piece of performance art to complement an exhibition inside the cathedral, <em>Music of Decline</em>, first shown in Liverpool Cathedral for a Granada TV arts show. He says:</p> <blockquote> <p>The paintings were shown in a circle by the alter and had to be concealed by a plethora of helpers before the filming because of the huge penises being shown.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>At the same time, the city's down-and-outs and transgressors had inspired his project <em>Bottles In, Bottles Out</em> described by Redhead as being</p> <blockquote> <p>based on transcripts of heroine addicts working the street. Making 'art' out of where I find myself meant working with drugs and dealing and prostitution - this was the landscape I painted - I hung out with the girls while they told their story - scoring in Granby Street, injecting etc</p> </blockquote> <p><br>By the time of the new century, John Redhead was spending less time on the rock face and more time exploring his visual and audio art projects. For a long time now, he had had a base in the North Wales climbing capital of Llanberis. However, the cultural and meteorological elements of Welsh life saw him pining for the heat of southern France, an area which has always attracted British artists. His experiences during this period are re countered in his latest book <em>Colonists Out</em>, published under his own <em><a href=\"http://www.johnredhead.org/John_Redhead/Books.html\">Serious Clowning</a></em> label.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395132736\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/23/1345757386871/john3.jpg\" alt=\"john redhead\" width=\"140\" height=\"200\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Redhead's latest book, available from one good ex-burger van.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unlike the great and the good of the climbing community who promote their latest books by speaking at lecture halls and theatres around the country, Redhead intends to promote <em>Colonists Out</em> by touring and selling his book from a burger van.

  "<p>When Anders Behring Breivik announced in the spring of 2011 that he was moving out of Oslo to become a farmer, his friends were pleased.</p> <p>After five years dossing about unemployed at his mum's flat, including 12 months playing video games day and night, Breivik finally appeared to have found some direction.</p> <p>In April 2011, just before he left the capital, the then 32-year-old hosted a barbecue for six friends. He was upping sticks to a farm near Rena, a town two hours north-east of Oslo, to grow sugar beet, he said. It was a bit of a curveball, but not totally out of character.</p> <p>Breivik, after all, was a man whose professional life had already taken some unusual twists, including an unsuccessful trip to Liberia to buy blood diamonds and a business selling fake degree certificates.</p> <p>\"I thought it was good that he moved out of his mother's house,\" one of his friends, a fireman, told Oslo central court. Breivik appeared to have regained his \"spark\" and his friends were relieved. They had worried about his increasingly erratic behaviour.</p> <p>At a party earlier in the year, he had announced he was not drinking as he was taking anabolic steroids and he had been banging on about Muslims \"seizing power\" in Norway. Then there was the book he had been writing about the Islamification of Europe, plus the mysterious nose job, undergone, apparently, after someone accused him of having an \"Arab nose\". One friend said he had never been the same after being jilted by a Belarusian girl he had met online.</p> <p>Others thought he was struggling with his sexuality after he started wearing makeup.</p> <p>In June last year, another friend, a lawyer, remembered meeting him in a cafe, where Breivik talked about the government subsidies available for farmers. \"I thought perhaps he had now emerged from his depression,\" said the lawyer.</p> <p>Little did they know that what Breivik was cultivating on the isolated farmyard was not sugar beet but a lethal bomb, which would kill eight people and injure more than 200 others.</p> <p>Curious about his rural life, they kept trying to visit but Breivik fobbed them off.</p> <p>\"For natural reasons I had to do everything I could to avoid this from happening,\" Breivik told the court. \"Gradually there was more pressure; they would say 'Why do you not want us to come up there?'</p> <p>On a couple of occasions they tried to drive up and a couple of times I had to turn off my mobile to avert visits \u2026 Only thing that went in my favour was there was no street address for the farm so they didn't find out where it was.\"</p> <p>Had the friends found the farm, they would have discovered Breivik in a chemical warfare suit, grinding up ammonium nitrate pills using four kitchen blenders \u2013 a technique he said he had copied from Andreas Baader of the Red Army Faction, the German terror group also known as the Baader Meinhof gang. Or perhaps strapping himself up with rucksacks, one front and one back, each containing 30kg of rocks, ready to go out training to build up his strength for what he anticipated would be a physically strenuous \"mission\".</p> <p>If they had arrived one afternoon during a storm they might have found him a mile away from the farm, waiting for a thunder clap so he could detonate a test charge.</p> <p>Breivik had thought of everything, each tiny detail that ensured his plan could be executed with dreadful accuracy. There was the \"sorry: sewage works\" sign he put in the window of the rented van he loaded with explosives and parked in Oslo city centre the day before the attacks (\"I was very concerned about passersby. These are chemicals that have a very strong smell.\"); the parking ticket he remembered to buy for the Fiat Doplo he used as a getaway car; the precise calculation on how many acres of farmland he would need to rent to justify the quantities of fertiliser he would be ordering.</p> <p>But perhaps the worst manifestation of Breivik's scrupulous attention to detail was the police uniform he bought on the internet and then wore to sail to the island of Ut\u00f8ya, having called ahead and convinced one of the adults running the annual summer camp of the ruling Labour Party's youth wing that he had been sent to reassure the teenagers in the aftermath of the Oslo bombings. They sent over a ferry to pick him up. An hour and 20 minutes later he had shot dead 67 of those people he claimed he had been sent to protect; one 17-year-old fell off a cliff and died trying to dodge Breivik's bullets. Another, also 17, drowned trying to escape.</p> <p>He'd had enough time to mull things over. By his own account, his twin attacks that left 77 dead had been five years in the making. The prosecution could find evidence of two years of determined planning: membership of an Oslo shooting club, jaunts around Europe buying guns and ammunition, internet transactions for fertiliser, military uniforms and other equipment.</p> <p>Breivik claimed he started plotting the attacks in earnest in 2006. After winding up his business ventures, he moved out of a shared flat and back in with his mother, Wenche Behring, who was single again after the breakup of her third marriage; her second,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/13/anders-behring-breivik-norway\" title=\"\"> to Breivik's father, Jens</a>, had gone sour when Breivik was just one.</p> <p>In the summer of that year, Breivik announced he was going to take a sabbatical to play the role-playing computer game World of Warcraft full-time. He deserved a break, he said, after four years working \"12\u201314 hour days\". Since dropping out of school, when not working in a call centre, he had cooked up various entrepreneurial schemes, including the lucrative fake diploma scam and a number of less successful companies selling telephone marketing services and outdoor advertising space.</p> <p>\"Some people take a year off playing golf. I wanted to take a year off to play World of Warcraft,\" he told the court. \"Especially bearing in mind the upcoming so-called suicide action \u2026 I wanted to have no remorse as to what I had missed out on.\"</p> <p>It was all part of his desensitisation plan, he insisted, of removing himself from normal life so that he could transform himself into a cold-blooded killer. \"In many ways it is a protection mechanism,\" he said. \"If you are going to be capable of executing such a bloody and horrendous operation, you need to work on your mind, your psyche, for years. We have seen from military traditions you cannot send an unprepared person into war.\"</p> <p>His family and friends fell for his cover story, he said. \"I played on the idea that 'Ooh, I've become addicted to games'.\" His sister, who lived in Los Angeles, thought he was in \"deep trouble, a games addict\", said Breivik. His mother was aghast, which was, he said, \"a fairly normal, healthy reaction. It would have been quite abnormal if she had just said, 'Oh, that's great, go ahead'. I couldn't tell her I was taking a sabbatical because I was going to blow myself up in five years' time.\"</p> <p>Under cross examination, Breivik admitted his mother was his \"achilles heel\" and \"the only one who can make me emotionally unstable\". He told the court he would urge his mother, a solitary woman, to find a hobby, but she would tell him, \"You're my hobby\".</p> <p>Wenche Behring had been called as a witness for the prosecution but did not attend court after being signed off by a doctor. She told psychiatrists assessing her son's mental health that he acted strangely after moving back in with her, sometimes sitting on top of her on the sofa or attempting to kiss her face. In a statement to police read out in court, she said: \"I felt like I was in prison with him. He was uncomfortably intense. He started saying I was a Marxist and a feminist. From 2010 he became really strange.\" The court heard how she had been frightened of him as a small boy. When he was just four, she called in social workers who wanted to remove the disturbed boy and put him in a foster home to prevent any further psychological disintegration.</p> <p>Breivik always claimed that while he operated as a \"one-man cell\" in order not to be \"flagged\" by the security services, he was a member of a shadowy cadre of anti-Islamists called the Knights Templar (KT).</p> <p>When he finally called police to surrender on Ut\u00f8ya, he introduced himself to the telephone operator as \"Commander of the Knights Templar Europe \u2013 we are organised in the anti-communistic and Norwegian resistance movement against the Islamisation of Europe and Norway.\"</p> <p>He claimed to have been at the group's inaugural meeting in London in April 2002, a pow-wow the prosecution do not believe ever happened, even though Border Agency data showed he was in the UK at that time. Investigators believe KT \"does not exist\", at least not in the way Breivik describes it.</p> <p>In police and psychiatric interviews, as well as in court, he has refused to reveal any details of the group's other members, including a British man whom he calls Richard the Lionheart in the 1,801-page compendium he compiled before the attacks to explain his motives.</p> <p>Breivik's travels in 2002 were one of the most disputed parts of his trial. Evidence from his passport proved that he had indeed gone to Liberia and then London via the Ivory Coast that spring, but what exactly he was doing there remains unclear.</p> <p>The prosecution believes he had fallen victim to a Nigerian internet scam and was hoping to get rich quick in the war-torn country by trading in so-called blood diamonds. But Breivik insisted the diamonds were a smoke screen, another cover story. Yes, he had bought diamond-cutting paraphernalia in Oslo and had gathered some Unicef brochures to take in his hand luggage in case he needed to pretend he was an aid worker, he said. But his true purpose was to meet a \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/18/anders-behring-breivik-serb-nationalists\" title=\"\">Serbian warlord</a>\" who, he said, was going to school him in the methods of \"militant nationalism\" .</p> <p>It was the Nato invasion of Serbia in 1999 that prompted the foundation of the KT, he said: \"That was the straw which broke the camel's back for many brothers who chose to go militant.\"</p> <p>But there were also personal experiences on the streets of Oslo that Breivik said contributed to his radicalisation. Though his friends disputed it in evidence, he claimed to have been involved \"in around 20 confrontations with Muslims in Norway\", including one which left him with a broken nose (hence the rhinoplasty). He had tried to fight against immigration using legitimate means, he said. He joined the Norwegian Progress party, he became a mason, he wrote letters to newspapers that were never printed and was an enthusiastic commenter on internet articles. Until 2006 he had no intention of taking up arms, he insisted, but instead chose to contribute financially to the fight against Islam (hence his money-making schemes).</p> <p>But in 2006, fed up at being ignored and disgusted by those he described as \"keyboard warriors\", he resolved to carry out what he called a \"mission\". With no job to take up his time, he spent months on the internet, practising his shooting on video games and reading voraciously about other terror attacks. He read the English-language media and schooled himself in al-Qaida's terror tactics by using Google Translate to understand terror manuals he found on the internet.</p> <p>He was particularly interested in the specifics of attacks. He noted that after Timothy McVeigh killed 168 people in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombings, the security services had banned the sale of fertiliser containing 98% ammonium nitrate. \"Following that attack, the EU and US governments decided to dilute ammonium nitrate \u2026 to 85%,\" he said, \"and there was an understanding among everyone that it would not detonate.\"</p> <p>With noticeable pride, he told the court he set himself a challenge to try to make a bomb out of this diluted chemical. Unfortunately, he succeeded.</p> <p>He was alert to mainstream politics just as much as the fringes, noting that \"Sarkozy, Merkel and Cameron have all said that multiculturalism has failed.\" He had studied recent history and was disgusted to see what happens \"any time the nationalist parties take over power\". He cited as examples the partial EU boycott after J\u00f6rg Haider's far-right Freedom party entered Austria's government in 2000, and the threats being made to the current <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/06/hungary-viktor-orban-faces-protest\" title=\"\">rightwing coalition in Hungary</a>, which he claimed, was under pressure to \"change their mind by being called intolerant nationalist Nazis\".</p> <p>Breivik insisted he was not alone in fighting against \"mass immigration\". He singled out the National Socialist Underground, the neo-Nazi terror cell revealed last year as being responsible for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/18/how-german-neo-nazis-evaded-police\" title=\"\">killing nine immigrants and one policewoman in Germany</a>, and Peter Mangs, the man found guilty last month of carrying out <a href=\"http://www.thelocal.se/42202/20120724/\" title=\"\"> killings over seven years in the Swedish city of Malm\u00f6</a>. It is important, he said, that these \"heroic young people\" should be \"celebrated\" for \"sacrificing\" their lives for the \"conservative revolution\".</p> <p>The deadly plan he settled on for 22 July was a compromise, he told the court. Originally he had wanted to hit three targets. As well as the government headquarters where he planted the fertiliser bomb, he wanted to hit the Labour party building in central Oslo, as well as a third target \u2013 perhaps the royal palace, a well-known squat called the Blitzhuset, the offices of the Aftenposten newspaper or NRK, the Norwegian state-owned broadcaster.</p> <p>But he had to scale down his plans after making a bomb proved more difficult than he expected. He was having problems synthesising picric acid, a chemical compound used as an explosive. He thought it would take three to four weeks to make three bombs; in the event, it took him three timesas long to make one. Plus he was running out of money, having reached the maximum on 10 of his 11 credit cards.</p> <p>The time delay meant he missed two other possible targets: the annual conference of Norwegian journalists and the main Labour party congress. He settled on Ut\u00f8ya only reluctantly, he said, knowing that many other militant nationalists would not agree with him killing children. He originally planned his attack to coincide with a visit to the island from Gro Harlem Brundtland, a former Norwegian prime minister. He wanted to decapitate her and film the execution, he said.</p> <p>But he wasn't ready on time and she was gone when he arrived.</p> <p>In the end he compromised, hoping merely to wipe out the next generation of liberal politicians on the island that day. \"The objective was not to kill 69 people at Ut\u00f8ya. The objective was to kill all of them,\" he said, adding that he planned to fire shots, scaring the campers into the water where he anticipated they would drown. \"The main goal was to use the water as a mass-destruction method. Basically, I assumed most people would drown,\" he said, adding, that it's \"hard to swim if you have death anxiety\".</p> <p>He didn't succeed on that point. But another of his goals has been achieved. He received the public trial he craved. \"Your arrest will mark the initiation of the propaganda phase,\" he wrote in the manifesto he posted online before his killing spree. \"Your trial offers you a stage to the world.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ah, the summer of 2012: it will forever bring back teary-eyed memories of the wrong kind. It was a time when good old German Fu\u00dfball was supposed to make a splash in the big pond again but saw its post-season challenges peter out like a leaky paddling pool instead. First Bayern Munich were transfixed in horror as their self-assured \"<em>mia san mia</em>\" (we are who we are) motto gave way to \"mia san meek\" at the penalty spot. Jupp Heynckes' side somehow concocted to lose the Champions League trophy on their home ground to a befuddled middle-aged man in a cardigan and an over-eager spectator who evaded security in full match-day apparel. Work that one out, android David.</p> <p>Not to be outdone, the national manager Jogi L\u00f6w then made matters much worse in Germany's Euro 2012 semi-final against Italy by overaccommodating the opposition with the narrowest of midfields. It was, without a doubt, the biggest lineup screw-up since special agent Dave Kujan let Verbal Kint hobble off.</p> <p>If those two giant mishaps served one good purpose it was to reinforce the lust for the Bundesliga, a world of wonder successfully isolated from decades of international underachievement. The German football lover is a fiercely loyal, upstanding creature of simple taste. Not for him the wallet-busting dreams of exotic, racy conquests on European nights; domestic, dependable action is where it's at. That sense of contentment at home is, as usual, reflected in the ever-growing number of season ticket sales. 428,495 jahreskarten were sold by the end of this week in the top flight, and that figure is artificially kept low by capped allocations, in an effort to keep seats available for casual fans. Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf, finally back in the Bundesliga after dropping all the way down to the fourth division after relegation in 1997, have managed to flog 31,000 season tickets \u2013 an impressive fourth in the table behind Borussia Dortmund (54,000), Schalke (43,195) and Bayern (38,000). Those three and nine further clubs have sold out their available season tickets contingents.</p> <p>After last season's double, Dortmund's emergence as a bona-fide heavyweight has undoubtedly enhanced the appeal of the league's 50th instalment. For the first time since the Black-Yellow's heyday in the mid-90s, they have been name-checked as title favourites alongside Bayern by the 18 Bundesliga coaches, a constituency that reliably voted Bavarian by huge margins in seasons gone by. So can Borussia, who start their title defence against Werder Bremen on Friday night, make it the first non-red and white hat-trick since Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach 35 years ago?</p> <p>On paper, the champions look just as tasty as before. Despite much real and much more made-up interest in their star players, they managed to keep all their important names apart from Shinji Kagawa. And in Marco Reus, the German Player of the Year, they've signed an even better man in the hole as the Japanese's replacement. Officially, a Champions League finish is the modest target but the manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp has said that his side's hunger for success is undiminished. \"The team are fortunate to have me, because I can never get enough,\" stated the 45-year-old. It'll be interesting to find out if the coach can at last adapt his side's ultra-energetic pressure game to the European stage. Better performances are mandatory after last season's embarrassing Champions League exit.</p> <p>Werder, their opponents in the Signal Iduna Park, have more humble concerns. The sporting director Klaus Allofs and the coach Thomas Schaaf have set out to rebuild the squad after two seasons without international football. The Nigerian striker Jonathan Akpala has joined from FC Br\u00fcgge along with Kevin de Bruyne, the on-loan winger from Chelsea, Juventus's Dutch enigma Eljero Elia and Nils Petersen from Bayern, also on loan. \"I'm keen to see whether we'll have enough to get a result,\" said Schaaf after an encouraging pre-season that was somewhat marred by a DFB Cup defeat at the hands of third division Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster last weekend. The supporters are also unhappy with the new shirt-sponsor Wiesenhof. It's a chicken company with a decidedly mixed record \u2013 and naturally the starting point of 1,000 poultry-based puns over the course of the campaign.</p> <p>Schalke, who finished third last season, have more realistic ambitions to rule the roost and are widely seen as the most likely side to challenge Bayern and Dortmund. The Royal Blues still have the league's best striker in Klaas-Jan Huntelaar as well as good depth in the squad following the acquisition of the Swiss winger Tranquilo Barnetta from Bayer Leverkusen and the midfielder Roman Neust\u00e4dter from Gladbach. Wolfsburg, prolific in the transfer market as is Felix Magath's wont, have aspirations for a top-four-finish, too.</p> <p>Bayern, meanwhile, have added yet another outspoken big ego to their board: self-styled \"firehead\" Matthias Sammer has joined as sporting director in place of the quiet Christian Nerlinger. It's an interesting set-up with far-reaching implications for the struggle for control behind the scenes and for Heynckes' standing at the club. But so far, it seems to work. After the arrival of Swiss winger Xherdan Shaqiri, Brazilian defender Dant\u00e9 from (Gladbach and the two strikers Claudio Pizarro from Werder and Mario Mandzukic from Wolfsburg, there are much-needed alternatives in the squad.</p> <p>The Athletic Bilbao midfielder Javi Mart\u00ednez might yet join for \u20ac40m but the transfer is being hampered by the intricacies of Spanish tax law and the immovability of Athletic's president Josu Urrutia. \"We will fight until the last day for the player,\" said Bayern's executive chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. Last year's runners-up in all competitions will start the season away to newly promoted Greuther F\u00fcrth who host matches in the deliciously-named Trolli ARENA. True fact: the ground used to be called Playmobil Stadion before, back when it could be quickly re-configured into a pirate ship, knight's castle or lunar station. (That last bit is not actually true, sadly).</p> <p>For Gladbach, meanwhile, the new beginning also marks the end, unfortunately: their Champions League dreams are all but over after crashing to a 3-1 defeat at home in the first leg of their qualifier against Dynamo Kiev. Lucien Favre seemed to blame new striker Luuk de Jong, a \u20ac15m addition from FC Twente, for the defeat, or perhaps the sporting director Max Eberl: \"Our forwards are too similar,\" scoffed the Swiss coach. A finish in the top half of the table is the Foals' very modest aim but maybe the luck of Lucien will return in the Europa League? Some international pulling power really wouldn't hurt the league's efforts to wrestle with Serie A and La Liga for second billing on global TV schedules, even if most German supporters, punch-drunk on what is still the world's most fan-friendly competition, really couldn't care less.</p>",
  "<h2>1) Liverpool 0-5 Manchester City (Friday 26 March 1937) \u2026</h2> <h2>\u2026 2) Manchester City 5-1 Liverpool (Monday 29 March 1937)</h2> <p>The race for the 1936-37 title was as tight as they come. Heading into the Easter programme, seven teams were in with a realistic shout of the championship. In order, with five points separating them: Arsenal, Charlton Athletic, Portsmouth, Brentford, Middlesbrough, Derby County and Manchester City. Wilf Wild's City side were the stragglers of the bunch but they did have two games in hand and furthermore were the form horses: they had not lost in the league since going down 5-3 at Grimsby on Christmas Day. In goal, City's crowd favourite, Frank Swift. Up front, a relatively new signing challenging Swift's status with the Maine Road faithful, the striker Peter Doherty.</p> <p>City would close the gap on leaders Arsenal over the holiday period with two stunning results, the first on Good Friday at Anfield. \"Manchester City's smashing 5-0 victory at Liverpool was as satisfying to the aesthete as to the hungriest football follower with mouth agape for championship points,\" wrote the Guardian's Old International (aka Donny Davies, like the aforementioned Swift, fated to lose his life at Munich Airport in 1958). \"City's superiority was overwhelming enough to nullify analysis.\"</p> <p>Fair enough, but for the record, the man of the match was said to be City's inside right Alex Herd, despite an Eric Brook hat-trick. (Herd's performance must have been quite something, because one of Brook's goals, from 30 yards, was hit at \"a pace that may well become the subject of a question in the House of Commons \u2026 his left foot is a lethal weapon that ought to entail a gun licence\".) Doherty also helped himself during the rout, with one of the 30 goals he would score in 41 games over the season. Liverpool could only muster one shot, a \"whiz-bang\" from Jackie Balmer; however \"that Swift saved even this masterpiece goes without saying. On this form, this 13-stone giant, with hands like buckets and the springiness of a grasshopper, surely has no peers.\" Meanwhile the former City star Matt Busby's \"disheartened display was a tragedy for Liverpool\", while their star forward Berry Nieuwenhuys was so marked out of the game that he was \"definitely on the unemployed list\".</p> <p>The following day, City surprisingly dropped a point at home, drawing 2-2 to relegation haunted Bolton Wanderers, but they bounced back on Easter Monday with, according to the Guardian, \"one of the swiftest transformations seen in any game at Moss Side\". It was the return fixture with Liverpool, and once again Herd was the tormentor supreme.</p> <p>Typically enough, City put their supporters through the mill. They went a goal down early doors, Nieuwenhuys clocking in this time to set up Fred Howe on five minutes. Swift was momentarily knocked unconscious, and required bandages around his head. Busby, generously welcomed back by his old fans, ran the game awhile. But City regrouped to level the scores before the break and after the restart they blitzed Liverpool with four goals in seven minutes. \"Herd suddenly made two successful smash and grab raids that left the visitors stunned and wondering.\" He was also \"behind the fourth of this quick-fire series of goals and City's fifth and last\".</p> <p>City had served notice of their intentions. They followed up their laceration of Liverpool with another double-header, belting Brentford 6-2 in London before pipping them 2-1 back home four days later. Arsenal were then put to the sword 2-0 at Maine Road, in a game that saw City snatch the leadership of the division from their opponents.</p> <p>City never looked back. They romped to their first title, three points clear of Charlton, having scored 107 goals, a mere 49 more than the second-placed side. Manchester United, meanwhile, were relegated. Great times for City, as good as they get \u2013 and so, naturally, they went down themselves the following year, despite scoring a best-in-division 80 goals \u2013 the only champions ever to suffer such an embarrassment.</p> <h2>3) Manchester City 0-3 Liverpool (4 October 1980)</h2> <p>Malcolm Allison's second stint at Manchester City didn't take long to unravel. Having sold off all the good players and frittered money away on tat, City were in the relegation places when reigning champions Liverpool came to town for the ninth game of the 1980-81 season.</p> <p>Things would get worse before they would get better. For City, that is. For Allison, things would just get worse. His days as a manager at the cutting edge of the game were already numbered, although he didn't know it yet.</p> <p>Liverpool outplayed Allison's struggling side to an embarrassing extent. Goals from Kenny Dalglish, Graeme Souness and Sammy Lee decided the game. Dalglish's opener was superb: picking up Avi Cohen's pass with his back to goal, he slithered through 180 degrees around a hapless Tommy Caton and guided a low snaker into the corner. Allison, giving it large while holding court after the match in the deluded style, opined that the goal was \"crap \u2026 it's gone in the net at about two miles per hour. How can that be a good goal from 20-odd yards?\" The man from the Guardian countered by suggesting that \"crap goals of this quality ought to besmirch every match\".</p> <p>Allison was gone within a couple of months. Liverpool went on to knock City out of the League Cup, on their way to the first of four in a row, and later in the season lifted the European Cup. They were in a transitional period, nonetheless, and were well off the pace in the league. Which says something about the low quality of European football at the time, but also a little about Allison's late-era City.</p> <p>John Bond ensured they stayed up, and gave Spurs a game in the cup final at least.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzzG3Rv3oZ0\" title=\"\">4) Liverpool 1-3 Manchester City (Boxing Day 1981)</a></h2> <p>It's not often that league champions are remembered principally for an abject defeat, but that's the strange fate of Liverpool's 1981-82 championship side. This particular title was perhaps Bob Paisley's sweetest victory. Both Paisley, and his Liverpool machine, were considered finished after a defeat to City on Boxing Day. Liverpool were reigning European champions but had only finished fifth the previous season and now found themselves in the bottom half of the table, 12th and floundering. City, meanwhile, were in the leading pack, two points behind leaders Swansea.</p> <p>They had risen thanks to a hilariously inept display by Liverpool's new keeper Bruce Grobbelaar, four months into his Anfield career having displaced Ray Clemence. During the opening period, he clawed thin air when attempting to make a simple catch, forcing his defenders to clear up a completely unnecessary mess as he rolled around the floor like a man who had been celebrating Christmas ever since taking delivery of several crates of Advocaat in October. He then repeated the trick during the second period with a fumble that led to the concession of penalty, before turning a soft Kevin Reeves flick into his own net, the result of an embarrassingly emotional attempt to cuddle the post like a man who had been celebrating Christmas ever since taking delivery of several crates of Advocaat in October.</p> <p>Alan Parry, in the BBC box, was not full of festive cheer.</p> <p>\"Grobbelaar's misery is complete,\" began his famous critique. \"Reeves gets the goal, but really it was almost an own goal by this sad figure.\" A depressing moment for the Reds, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzzG3Rv3oZ0\" title=\"\">yet it's a clip, and a commentary</a>, which has entered Anfield folklore, proudly featured on the BBC's History of Liverpool video \u2013 as it was the pivot on which the season dramatically turned. Liverpool went on the rampage during the second half of the season, eventually pipping Ipswich Town to the title. City ended the campaign in 10th spot.</p> <p>What's often forgotten by this game \u2013 which was City's first win at Anfield in 28 years \u2013 is that play had been stopped awhile after visiting keeper Joe Corrigan was knocked out by a bottle thrown from the Kop. A sign of the times, perhaps, but in more ways than one. Upon being revived, Corrigan was warmly applauded by the Kop, shamed at the actions of one clown. And the keeper himself couldn't be doing with making a fuss of it. \"They're fantastic people,\" he said after the game. \"They've always been fair to me. I've been coming here for 12 years and this is the first time anything of this sort has happened.\"</p> <p>Whether Grobbelaar was secretly wishing his opposite number had made more of a drama, to deflect attention from his own antics, was never recorded.</p> <h2>5) Manchester City 0-4 Liverpool (13 March 1988)</h2> <p>Hindsight is supposed to snap everything into sharp focus, but truth be told, more often than not it distorts. Take Wimbledon's victory over Liverpool in the 1988 FA Cup final. It's held up as one of the great giantkillings, yet that does a supremely underrated Dons team an extreme disservice. Take a sample of contemporary opinion: when the draw for the sixth round was made that February, with 10 teams remaining in the pot, Wimbledon were the 6-1 third favourites, ranked ahead of Brian Clough's last high-class Nottingham Forest side. Kenny Dalglish's side \u2013 runaway league leaders, his signature achievement as a manager \u2013 were expected to win that final, sure. But it wasn't a stunning reverse of Sunderland '73 proportions, or even West Ham seven years later.</p> <p>Anyway, we mention this because earlier in that FA Cup campaign \u2013 the aforementioned sixth round, in fact \u2013 eventual runners-up Liverpool were paired with Manchester City of the Second Division. Liverpool were on their way to the title, while City were going through one of their regular rebuilding processes. As it turned out, the result was pretty much as expected \u2013 but it should not be forgotten that, at the time, City fans went into the match with plenty of hope. They had never lost in the FA Cup to Liverpool \u2013 that shouldn't mean anything, but of course in football it does \u2013 having beaten them on the way to the Cup in 1956, and repeated the trick in the fourth round in 1973. They had a major top-flight scalp to their name that season, having trounced Forest 3-0 in the League Cup. And they had one of the country's hottest up-and-coming talents in \u2013 now don't laugh, remember what we said about hindsight \u2013 Paul Stewart. There was a genuine belief that, while Liverpool were clear favourites, City could give it a go. ITV certainly thought so, opting to televise the match live in preference to the more traditional top-division rammy between George Graham's emerging Arsenal and Forest.</p> <p>But no. Young City \u2013 built around Stewart, Paul Lake, Ian Brightwell, Andy Hinchcliffe and David White \u2013 went toe-to-toe with the Red Men for 33 minutes, until Ray Houghton put the visitors ahead by volleying home a John Barnes cross. The home fans had convinced themselves (erroneously) that Barnes had handled in the buildup, and seethed accordingly. When Lake bundled Craig Johnson over in the area early in the second half, Peter Beardsley converting the penalty, the crowd erupted with some more frankly unjustified righteous displeasure. A lad ran on to the playing surface, pointed menacingly at referee Alan Gunn, then threw a right-hander at some poor steward. City responded, powered by the steam of their fans, and Stewart went close with a firm header, but Bruce Grobbelaar denied the youthful striker. Houghton made it three, Lake handled in the box but got away with it, and Barnes rounded the victory off with a fourth. Liverpool had made the semis. Easily, as it turned out, but it was never the pre-match shoo-in it appears now.</p> <h2>6) Manchester City 2-2 Liverpool (5 May 1996)</h2> <p>\"I am confident we will stay up, because we have prepared well and we are ready.\" That was Alan Ball, the day before his Manchester City side went into battle at Maine Road against Liverpool, desperate to retain their Premier League status. Even a win would not guarantee their survival. Wins for their fellow strugglers Southampton and Coventry City, on equal points but with better goal difference, and a draw for Sheffield Wednesday, two points ahead and also with a healthier balance in the goals column, would have done for City, even if Bally's boys spanked Roy Evans's FA Cup finalists. But in all statistical likelihood, a win would have been enough.</p> <p>And a win would indeed have been enough. Saints drew 0-0 with Wimbledon, while Coventry held Leeds in another goalless encounter. But City were fed some bogus information \u2013 Wimbledon, they had been told, had scored a late goal at the Dell \u2013 and so a most Cityesque denouement to the season unfolded.</p> <p>City looked to have been down and out, Steve Lomas clumsily deflecting Steve McManaman's cross into his own net after six minutes. Just before half-time, Ian Rush marked his last game for Liverpool with a deflected drive to make it 2-0. But with 19 minutes to go, Neil Ruddock clattered Georgi Kinkladze like some sort of lumbering oaf, Uwe R\u00f6sler slotting home the penalty. Seven minutes later, Kit Symons equalised. And so as the sands of time ran out, with Southampton \"losing\", the diktat was delivered: keep the ball in the corner, to secure the draw that would keep City in the big league.</p> <p>Oh dear. Poor Lomas, whose day had began so badly, held the ball by the flag. As the clock ticked down on the pitch, the sorry truth was beginning to be realised off it. City might have prepared professionally, but their in-game information management wasn't quite up to speed. Wimbledon hadn't scored at all. As things stood, Saints were safe. Niall Quinn, long substituted and now demobbed in his shirt and breeks, sprinted from the stands to the touchline, screaming to Lomas to get moving.

  "<p>Both coalition parties went that extra mile to woo various equalities lobbies before the general election, yet Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are now conspiring to dramatically <a href=\"http://www.sundaymercury.net/news/midlands-news/2012/08/05/birmingham-race-campaigner-maxie-hayles-hit-out-at-plans-to-axe-equality-and-human-rights-commission-jobs-66331-31551196/\" title=\"\">downsize the institution responsible for upholding equalities laws</a>.</p> <p>Take race equality. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/17/black-britain-unemployment-conservatives\" title=\"\">Writing on this site</a> David Cameron promised to change black Britain with \"concerted action to overcome the racial barriers that exist in Britain today\", while the Lib Dems published a race mini-manifesto pledging to \"end race discrimination in employment\".</p> <p>Nick Clegg, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/nov/24/nick-clegg-british-banks-racist\" title=\"\">in a lecture</a> to mark 30 years since the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarman_report\" title=\"\">Scarman report</a> was published, said: \"Real equality is not just the absence of prejudice, it is the existence of fairness.\"</p> <p>Two years on, disproportionate black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) unemployment has risen significantly while unequal outcomes remain as high as ever across health and the criminal justice system.</p> <p>Now the coalition plans to slash the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to within an inch of its life.</p> <p>The commission is meant to uphold equality laws covering gender, disabilities, age, sexual orientation and race. It has the power to launch investigations into public services suspected of discriminating and publish \"non-discrimination notices\" enforceable by the courts.</p> <p>To many this institution might seem remote, and its work invisible. Yet while we cannot see how it improves our day-to-day lives, if you look closer there is a great deal of valuable work going on across the various equalities \"strands\" to improve protection against unfair workplace practices.</p> <p>It has also defied the UK government on issues such as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/18/abu-qatada-deportation-human-rights\" title=\"\">Abu Qatada deportation</a>, promoted voting rights for prisoners and taken chancellor George Osborne to task for failing to run the rule over his budget which penalised already disadvantaged groups including women.</p> <p>In May the Liberal Democrat Home Office minister Lynne Featherstone announced she was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/may/15/equality-human-rights-commission-cuts\" title=\"\">chopping the EHRC's budget in half</a>, to \u00a326m. More recently it emerged that the commission had <a href=\"http://www.sundaymercury.net/news/midlands-news/2012/08/05/birmingham-race-campaigner-maxie-hayles-hit-out-at-plans-to-axe-equality-and-human-rights-commission-jobs-66331-31551196/\" title=\"\">prepared an even smaller annual budget of \u00a318m</a>. That's just a quarter of the original \u00a370m it started life with under Labour in 2007.</p> <p>These savage cuts will leave the commission with just 150 staff, fewer than the old Commission for Racial Equality and the Disability Rights Commission had before they were merged into the EHRC.</p> <p>I am alarmed at reports that the vast majority of staff facing redundancy are from BAME backgrounds. When Trevor Phillips retires as chairman next month, the new management will be all white. Hardly an example to Britain's public institutions.</p> <p>As a Lib Dem councillor I am deeply ashamed that my party is fronting up these cuts.</p> <p>To make matters worse, Featherstone is also planning a bonfire of the commission's investigation powers as well as burning the \"duties\" on public authorities to monitor equalities and promote good relations.</p> <p>All in the name of reducing the \"burden\" of red tape. So if ensuring public services are delivered fairly is a burden, what does that say about the coalition's attitude to equalities in general?</p> <p>The plan to scrap the \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/oct/03/equality-act-first-anniversary\" title=\"\">socio-economic duty</a>\" \u2013 requiring authorities to assess whether policies might adversely affect the poor \u2013 is particularly alarming in our class-ridden nation, with its entrenched underclass and one of the poorest records for social mobility in the western world.</p> <p>A combination of biting budget cuts and the stripping away of many of its powers threatens to turn the commission into little more than a glorified equalities thinktank. A sort of PR agency for equality, unable carry out its core functions let alone truly get to grips with tackling institutional discrimination or mount landmark test cases in the courts.</p> <p>Even the United Nations is concerned about what's going on, threatening to remove the commission's \"A-status\" as a national human rights institution believing it could become too small to qualify.</p> <p>The effect of these coalition cuts is to take away the commission's enforcement stick, leaving it with a solitary carrot of gentle persuasion. If only tackling inequality was so simple.</p> <p>The softly-softly approach is merely an early opportunity for public authorities to get it right from the beginning, not an end in itself. It is like abolishing the police and replacing them with billboard ads encouraging everyone to be law-abiding. How do you apprehend those who break the law regardless?</p> <p>That's why these cuts matter. It's about the political will of this government to make Britain a more equal country.</p> <p>The EHRC is not perfect. It has its faults. Its first three budgets were rejected by the National Audit Office and Phillips's controversial reappointment by the then Labour minister Harriet Harman set off an internal fight.</p> <p>In fairness, this dysfunctionality was resolved at least two years ago with new financial controls and changes to the organisation's structure, so ministers who refer back to these old problems are scraping the barrel of excuses to slash the commission.</p> <p>Former trade union leader Baroness Margaret Prosser, who takes over from Phillips, is currently facing a rebellion from staff, many of whom face the axe.</p> <p>It feels like the body is well on its way to being abolished by stealth. If it survives it will be a hollowed-out pale shadow of itself.</p> <p>Far from special-pleading to protect a self-serving \"equalities industry\", the arguments in favour of protecting the EHRC are very simple. The sheer scale and entrenched nature of inequality and discrimination in Britain mean that victims \u2013 and potential victims \u2013 need an empowered and properly resourced institution to be their protector and defender.</p> <p>As the coalition also plans to charge people fees for taking out employment tribunal cases, isn't it better to prevent discrimination occurring in the first place?</p> <p>Cameron and Clegg talk about fairness yet striving to eliminate inequality is a hallmark of a fair society. Vandalising the EHRC will surely make us a less fair country.</p>",
  "<p>The big three parties are as dominant as ever in local politics. According to the <a href=\"http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/pages/view.asp?page=16182\" title=\"\">Elections Centre</a> at Plymouth University, independents and small parties such as the Greens and the UK Independence party have been putting up more candidates and therefore securing a bigger proportion of the vote, but the first-past-the-post voting system means they get scant reward in terms of seats.</p> <p>In 2011, for example, the Green party received 3.6% of the vote but only 0.8% of the seats.</p> <p>Councillors matter to the national parties both as a barometer of support and as the foot soldiers for the general election campaign; several years of being drubbed in local elections destroys morale and means many local activists and defeated councillors simply fail to turn up to do the hard work.</p> <p>But apart from a little lip service, national parties routinely wreck any notion that local elections are about local issues. Take Labour leader Ed Miliband's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17580718\" title=\"\">launch of his party's local election campaign</a> in April \u2013 he promised to protect 6,000 nurses from government cuts.</p> <p>National sensitivities have also narrowed the ground over which local parties can fight. Labour, desperate to shed any hint of being a \"tax and spend\" party, long ago reined in council tax increases among its councils, and the tax controls are now such that little room for manoeuvre remains in any case.</p> <p>Michael Gove's education reforms open up some room for differences over schools policy, but without the clarity of simple ideological banners. Despite Conservative controlled Kent county council finding some legal wriggle room to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/mar/31/grammar-school-expansion-kent-  town\" title=\"\">expand its grammar school provision</a>, and the possibility of some other grammar schools expanding, legislation means Tory groups do not have the choice of standing on a grammar school ticket.</p> <p>Turnout in local elections still hovers around the 30% mark. While this is a dreadful figure, it appears to be holding up rather better than general elections, so the gap has narrowed. But that hardly constitutes progress. (And both figures are suppressed by voting procedures which make no sense in the 21st century.)</p> <p>Perhaps the biggest failure of party groups on councils is that they simply do not look like their residents. There has been a modest improvement in the proportions of women and ethnic minority councillors, but the number of party groups who are anywhere near to approaching a cross-section of local people is vanishingly small.</p> <p>Still excessively white, male and retired, sporadic initiatives over the years have all too clearly been inadequate to inspire change. To rejuvenate and diversify, local parties need to make finding, training and promoting talent a key priority \u2013 and that means some long serving councillors surrendering their seats.</p> <p>Term limits would be repellent to many and can seem arbitrary and undemocratic, but they would clear space for change.</p> <p>Political parties can often seem a debilitating influence. Tribalism leads to a false polarisation of views where personal antipathy is too often passed off as principled difference. Party whips are applied to bureaucratic minutiae and low level decisions which don't warrant such control, and too little space is often given for councillors to represent the views of their local residents when this conflicts with the position of the member's party machine.</p> <p>Personal relations between groups (never mind within them) often appear unnecessarily confrontational and ill-tempered. But despite their weaknesses the party groups remain the engine of local politics.</p> <p>English voters have shown they are, with rare exceptions, instinctively against vesting power in directly elected mayors. The widespread rejection of the idea shows the belief \u2013 by both Labour and Conservative governments \u2013 that the public would strip local political groups of their power when given the chance has proved unfounded.</p> <p>The public seems to believe running councils through party groups works. While local political differences might more accurately be described in different shades, parties help differentiate them in bright colours.</p> <p>Ruling groups can define a set of values and a programme and drive it through in a way few councils populated solely by independents would be able to match. With all the restrictions and interference they still have the opportunity to shape the future of their area.</p> <p>They provide officers with a framework to ensure good governance, and the coherence and strength to make tough decisions. And their clear banner means they can easily be rewarded at the ballot box for their successes and punished for their failings.</p> <p><em>Richard Vize is a commentator on public policy and management.

  "<p>Each week we look at two shops competing in the same sector, and review what they are offering customers: from how helpful the staff are to the best bargains on offer.</p> <p>Our review will be based on a visit to stores on the same high street, or online, so it will be just a snapshot of how the retailer is performing.</p> <p>To get a better idea of which retailers are delivering and which are falling short, we would like you to tell us about your experiences of the same shops.</p> <p>Some weeks, both stores we visit may do a good job; other weeks there will be one that stands out as being much better or worse. Your reviews will help us discover if this is a trend.</p> <p>This week, we compare the take-away operations on offer from Domino's Pizza and Pizza Hut.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.dominos.co.uk/\" title=\"Domino's website\"><strong>Domino's Pizza</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Background</strong> Domino's Pizza began life in 1960 when Tom Monaghan bought a local takeaway in Michigan. After finding success in his home state, Monaghan expanded the chain across the US and then around the world. The firm's first UK franchise opened in Luton in 1985 and it now has nearly 700 stores in the UK.</p> <p><strong>The visit</strong> 8.30pm, 20 August, Hartlepool.</p> <p><strong>What it sells</strong> Pizza, side orders, drinks and desserts.</p> <p><strong>First impressions</strong> A well presented shop with bright, welcoming signage on the front of the building. Inside it was spotless and a member of staff came to the counter to assist me soon after I entered. The range of pizzas and other food on offer was well presented on signs at the front of the shop, and a small seating area was available by the window for use when waiting for orders.</p> <p><strong>What were the staff like?</strong> Adept. They fielded phone calls, took care of online orders and served customers.</p> <p><strong>Best bargain</strong> Any size pizza for \u00a38.99 when collected.</p> <p><strong>What does it charge?</strong> Medium double pepperoni pizza (eight slices), \u00a313.99; seven chicken strips, \u00a34.50; 1.25 litre bottle of Coca-Cola, \u00a31.89; small margherita pizza (six slices), \u00a36.99.</p> <p><strong>Where can I pay?</strong> Everything operates from one large counter at the front of the shop, although customers can pay in advance using Domino's website and phone apps.</p> <p><strong>Is loyalty rewarded?</strong> No.</p> <p><strong>Lasting impressions</strong> The selection of food on offer was impressive, from regular pizzas and sides to a recently launched gourmet range, which included pizzas made using ingredients such as baby spinach and feta cheese. It was also offering a number of Mexican-themed pizzas for a limited time. In terms of actual taste, the standard pizza base is a little stodgy, but the range of toppings available is impressive, with the meatballs a particular highlight. Several other bases and crusts are also offered, from the standard cheese stuffed crust to a dominator base, which contains a layer of cheese sauce in between two standard pizza bases.</p> <p><strong>Overall rating</strong> 8/10.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.pizzahut.co.uk/\" title=\"Pizza Hut website\"><strong>Pizza Hut</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Background</strong> Pizza Hut was founded by brothers Dan and Frank Carney in 1958 in the state of Kansas. The first British restaurant opened in Islington, London, in 1973, with the first delivery store opening 15 years later. It now has 700 locations in the UK, with half of this figure compromising restaurants which offer a collection service and the remainder offering takeaway only.</p> <p><strong>The visit</strong> 8pm, 20 August, Hartlepool.</p> <p><strong>What it sells</strong> Pizza, side orders, drinks and desserts.</p> <p><strong>First impressions</strong> Small but perfectly formed, this takeaway Pizza Hut is in the same building as a fully fledged restaurant. It was clean and tidy on this visit, with a comfy seating area for customers to wait for their order.</p> <p><strong>What were the staff like?</strong> Courteous. My order was slightly delayed and a member of staff kindly offered a drink while I waited.</p> <p><strong>Best bargain</strong> A meal deal offering two large pizzas, a classic side and a 2 litre bottle of soft drink for \u00a319.95.</p> <p><strong>What does it charge?</strong> Large double pepperoni pizza (eight slices), \u00a314.55; Five chicken strips, \u00a33.95; 2 litre Pepsi, \u00a32.29; regular margherita pizza (six slices), \u00a36.75.</p> <p><strong>Where can I pay?</strong> Orders are placed and collected at the single large window. Customers can pay in advance online or in-store when collecting their order.</p> <p><strong>Is loyalty rewarded?</strong> No.</p> <p><strong>Lasting impressions</strong> While this branch offered a smaller choice of pizzas than some dedicated Pizza Hut takeaway outlets, the option for customers to create their own pizza means all but the most exotic pizza eaters are catered for. Despite the smaller range the number of desserts on offer was particularly impressive, with profiteroles, chocolate fudge cake and banoffee cookie dough all on the menu.</p> <p>The standard pizza base was thin and crispy, with a \"cheesy bites\" option available to replace the standard crust, with tasty individual cheesy dough balls. Most of the toppings were of a good quality, although the margherita pizza was a little too bland for my tastes. </p> <p><strong>Overall rating</strong> 8/10.</p> <p><strong>Adam's verdict </strong>Two evenly matched chains, which clearly take much inspiration from each other. Domino's and Pizza Hut run identical \"buy one, get one free\" offers each Tuesday, and their menus contain a broadly similar range of offers to entice customers ordering several items. </p> <p>Prices were about the same level, although the sizing systems were oddly different, a large pizza from Pizza Hut being equivalent to a medium from Domino's. The pizza bases at Pizza Hut were crispier that at Domino's, although the latter's meatball topping was the best on offer at either chain.</p> <p>This branch of Pizza Hut had a far smaller range of sides on offer than its rival, with just six items on the menu compared to 14 at Domino's, but offered a far more adventurous selection of desserts. A dead heat.</p> <h2><strong>Last week</strong></h2> <p>In the battle of the bakers, Greggs edged out Percy Ingle winning 42% of the 727 votes to Ingle's 25%.

  "<p>The Sun has become the first British newspaper to publish photographs of Prince Harry naked in a Las Vegas hotel room, claiming the move was in the public interest.</p> <p>The tabloid's decision comes after Prince Charles's royal aides threatened legal action against newspapers if they published the images, despite the fact they had already been circulated online.</p> <p>One of the two naked pictures of Harry is splashed across the paper's front page with the headline \"Heir it is!\", a day after a male reporter and a female intern posed in a mock-up.</p> <p>In an editorial, the Sun claimed there was a \"clear public interest\" in publishing the photographs \"in order for the debate around them to be fully informed\".</p> <p>It added: \"The photos have potential implications for the Prince's image representing Britain around the world.</p> <p>\"There are questions over his security during the Las Vegas holiday. Questions as to whether his position in the army might be affected. Further, we believe Harry has compromised his own privacy.\"</p> <p>The grainy mobile phone pictures of the prince's antics were first published online by the US showbiz gossip website TMZ early on Wednesday.</p> <p>Clarence House confirmed their authenticity but royal aides moved quickly to warn British media organisations not to republish the embarrassing photographs, with newspapers complying until the Sun broke ranks on Thursday night.</p> <p>A Press Complaints Commission spokesman said on Thursday: \"This was an editorial decision taken by the Sun. Should the PCC receive a complaint, it will investigate it following normal procedures.\"</p> <p>Sun managing editor David Dinsmore said the paper had \"thought long and hard\" about whether to use the pictures and said it was an issue of freedom of the press rather than because it was moralising about Harry's actions.</p> <p>He said: \"This is about the ludicrous situation where a picture can be seen by hundreds of millions of people around the world on the internet, but can't be seen in the nation's favourite paper read by eight million people every day.</p> <p>\"This is about our readers getting involved in discussion with the man who's third in line to the throne, it's as simple as that.\"</p> <p>A St James's Palace spokesman said: \"We have made our views on Prince Harry's privacy known. Newspapers regulate themselves, so the publication of the photographs is ultimately a decision for editors to make.\"</p> <p>There was a mixed reaction to the publication of the photos. Media lawyer Mark Stephens said: \"There is no public interest in publishing these pictures, even the Sun can't come up with a public interest in publishing these pictures, and the fact that they are available in foreign media doesn't make English law any less applicable. They have broken the law cynically, and obviously with a view to obtaining publicity.\"</p> <p>Stephens, of law firm Finers Stephens Innocent, said the move had \"put a shot through the bottom of the media boat\" in terms of the Leveson inquiry into media ethics.</p> <p>\"He [Lord Justice Leveson] will be sitting there looking at what the Sun has done, and thinking, 'I'm going to have to regulate for the lowest common denominator, because I can't trust them to look after themselves'.</p> <p>\"This shows that the PCC is a toothless watchdog, or lapdog, because it is unable to sanction the Sun for what it has done.</p> <p>\"The Sun has thumbed its nose at the PCC, and at self regulation. What is Leveson to do when a significant newspaper says, 'we don't think self regulation is worth a light, we are going to ignore it'?\"</p> <p>Former Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie said he doubted the tabloid had needed to pay for the pictures as they were so widespread on the internet.</p> <p>He told BBC2's Newsnight: \"Fortunately America is known as the land of the free, which is the opposite position of the UK where you're starting to get prime ministers like Cameron wheeling out judges like Leveson and a parliament who want to gang up exclusively on newspapers in the UK, whereas of course readers in every other part of the world and on every website in the world, including major news organisations like CNN, have been publishing these pictures for the last 36 hours.</p> <p>\"It really is absolutely shocking. I'm unsure why the establishment hate newspapers so much but what I'd like to see is editors get off their knees and start pushing back against these curtailments in what will eventually, I promise you, lead to the closure of newspapers.</p> <p>\"People should stop worrying about privacy and start worrying about what free speech will mean to this country if the Levesons and the Camerons of this country have their way.\"</p> <p>Former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott said the Sun had shown \"absolute utter contempt\" for the law and for the Leveson inquiry into media ethics.</p> <p>\"It is not about privacy. It is about money, money, money. And they know that by exclusively printing the pictures, assuming they are the only [British] paper which does, they will get everybody buying the paper to see this.\"</p> <p>Referring to the PCC, he said: \"They show an utter contempt even for the body they still have some influence in.\"</p>",
  "<p>Cabinet reshuffles can be tricky things to undertake.</p> <p>Used properly, they enable Prime Ministers to breathe new life into their Governments and help them to stamp their authority on Whitehall. In 1981, Thatcher famously <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/dec/30/thatcher-battled-cabinet-wets-national-archives\">used a shuffle </a>of her pack to purge her Government of the so called 'wets' in an attempt to show that she was in charge, which she managed to do extremely successfully. She became undoubtedly the biggest figure in British politics until the last year or so of her time at Downing Street.</p> <p>Get a reshuffle wrong however and things can get sticky. Harold Macmillan's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18722428\">'Night of the Long Knives'</a> in which he dumped seven of his cabinet ministers proved an unmitigated disaster. Likewise Tony <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2003/jun/13/publicservices.constitution\">Blair's reshuffle</a> of 2003 proved ill thought-out as he proudly announced that he had abolished the post of Lord Chancellor before later finding out that the law didn't allow him to do so. </p> <p>And the hazards don't stop, there. In reshuffling the ministerial pack, Prime Ministers have a 3D game of chess to play. Ensuring continuity whilst being able to inject fresh blood into the top team; keeping all wings of the party happy; and ensuring that they don't create too many enemies on the backbenchers - to name just three considerations. Blair for example had the constant worry in the background about how Gordon Brown would react to his shuffles.</p> <p>For David Cameron however, things are exacerbated tenfold. As he mulls what looks set to be an imminent reshuffle from his holiday sunlounger, the prospect is likely to be causing him one mighty headache.</p> <p>Putting aside the Ken Clarke problem, within his party Cameron has a hugely delicate task to perform. Little wonder that multiple strategies are being leaked to the press. The <em>Daily Telegraph </em>for example <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9481240/Tory-class-of-2005-will-be-promoted-in-Government-reshuffle-next-month\">has reported </a>that a number of the 2005 Conservative intake will be promoted in an effort to appease those who bear grievances and feel that they have so far been looked over in the promotion stakes. <em>ConservativeHome</em> has gone big on <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/parliament/2012/08/10-from-10.html\">plugging those </a>from the Conservative's class of 2010 who should be handed keys to ministerial red boxes. And the need to maintain the Lib Dem/Conservative ratio in Government and for Cameron to keep both the left and right wings of his party together remain as pressing as ever. </p> <p>Yet amidst all the talk of the Prime Minister needing to balance things out, one crucial factor is missing \u2013 regional balance. </p> <p>A glance at the list of <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/government-and-opposition1/her-majestys-government/\">Government ministers </a>reveals that just seven of them represent constituencies in northern England - three inside cabinet and four outside. Further, in the vast amount of material published on the forthcoming reshuffle so far, all the runners and riders looking set for promotion come from outside our three northern regions.</p> <p>Whilst it is undoubtedly the case that Prime Ministers should pick whoever is best for ministerial positions based on competence rather than where they represent, Cameron, whether he realises it yet or not, is in desperate need of more northern voices around his top table. </p> <p>As I have <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/may/11/davidcameron-edmiliband\">previously argued</a>, the Conservatives also desperately need more seats across the north if they are to achieve that elusive majority at the next general election. That prospect has been made harder because of the decision by Nick Clegg to veto constituency boundary changes.</p> <p>With the Olympics now done and dusted, Ministers need to expand as much energy into building up the north as has been invested in London and the south east over the past few years. It is nowhere near enough that the likes of Eric Pickles and Justine Greening are northern by birth. They now represent Parliamentary seats in the south. Nothing can beat the authenticity of northern MPs, in Government and Cabinet, having to return to the region on a weekly basis and hear in surgeries week in and week out of the personal, harsh struggles faced by fellow-northerners. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395170559\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/8/5/1344194558937/Nick-Clegg-002.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Clegg\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\"Look how many medals Yorkshire's winning, Dave.

With constitutional reform proving so divisive for the coalition partners, economic growth a dim memory and<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/21/uk-public-finances-deficit-borrowing\"> borrowing increasing</a>, all of the supposed <em>raisons d'etre</em> of the coalition have one by one been eroded.</p> <p>As they mull the reshuffle therefore, perhaps the best question for both David Cameron and Nick Clegg to be asking themselves is not who should have what job but something far more fundamental: what exactly is the point of this Government?</p> <p><em><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ed-jacobs\">Ed Jacobs</a></strong> is a political consultant at the&#xa0;Leeds based&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.publicaffairsco.com/\">Public Affairs Company</a>&#xa0;and devolution correspondent for the centre-left political and policy blog,&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.leftfootforward.org/\">Left Foot Forward.</a></em></p>",
  "<p>Mauricia is shaking. She is in bed at the hospital where she has come to escape her husband. Her hair is pulled back tightly into a neat bun and her nails are painted pink. Her dress is splattered with blood from the punch that broke her nose.</p> <p>\"I was feeding baby when he come home, drunk again,\" the 22-year-old says of her husband, an unemployed labourer. \"He angry and smash me.\"</p> <p>It is not the first time it has happened and is unlikely to be the last, but Mauricia \u2013 fearful of repercussions \u2013 does not want to involve the police. \"Baby need me, I cannot leave,\" she says simply.</p> <p>It has been two years since Timor-Leste passed a law criminalising domestic violence, yet it remains the country's number one crime. Continued obstacles such as lack of rule of law, a feeble judicial system, economic dependence, and a culture of silence mean nearly one-third of all women have experienced some form of violence or assault since the age of 15, according to <a href=\"http://dne.mof.gov.tl/published/TLDHS%202009-10/Final%20Report%20TLDHS%202010.pdf\" title=\"\">the government's 2009-10 demographic and health survey</a> (pdf). In the capital, Dili, that figure rises to one in two.</p> <p>\"Despite the law against domestic violence, communities haven't changed their behaviour,\" says Marcelina Amaral, of Timor-Leste's victim support services (VSS), a legal aid unit that helps people who have experienced domestic violence seek help and justice.</p> <p>\"Our own culture makes it really hard for women to come forward in the justice system. Because of cultural reasons and economic dependency, most women have very low education levels, so they don't feel empowered to make decisions about their cases.\"</p> <p>Still considered a private matter among families, three in four domestic violence cases go unreported to police who, under the 2010 law, are required to investigate the crime within five days of it being lodged. Police stations, however, lack scientific testing and are often located far from the crime scene, particularly in rural areas. This frequently leaves people seeking justice through traditional courts, which prioritise community harmony over individual justice.</p> <p>\"Many people who live in rural areas don't have any information about the [official] legal system, so they decide to resolve [cases] in a traditional way,\" explains Luis de Oliveira Sampaio of Timor-Leste's judicial system monitoring programme (JSMP), which oversees the VSS. \"In [a rape] case they would decide to get married, because they don't understand how the legal system should work.\"</p> <p>But the official system has its flaws too. Without scientific evidence, cases frequently depend on testimony from the victim, who can be pressured to withdraw her case. According to <a href=\"http://www.jsmp.minihub.org/English/webpage/publica/2012/June/Institutional%20Report%202011_English.pdf\" title=\"\">JSMP's 2011 annual report</a> (pdf), Timorese courts are often underequipped, lacking basics like running water, generators and judges. And the country's severely limited number of public defenders can result in both the victim and defendant sharing the same lawyer.</p> <p>Lisa Mortimer, a VSS lawyer, identifies a further problem: \"The trial process is so long that the victim has usually resolved the issue with her husband and community in the meantime. The victim often says: 'If you send him to jail now, I have no one to take care of me or the family'. When we do get sentences, they're usually suspended.\"</p> <p>Violence is nothing new to Timor-Leste, which was colonised by the Portuguese for nearly 500 years before being annexed by neighbouring Indonesia in 1975. According to the UN, widespread rape and sexual assault of both women and children went grossly unpunished during the military occupation, which lasted 24 years.</p> <p>Today, 71% of men say physical violence against their wife is acceptable if they've neglected the children, while 72% of women say wife-beating is justified if a woman goes out without telling her husband, according to the government's demographic survey.</p> <p>Domestic violence is one of many problems facing Timor-Leste, which is ranked 147 out of 187 countries in the <a href=\"http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/\" title=\"\">UN 2011 human development index</a>. Running water and electricity are considered luxuries, and 40% of the population lives on less than $1.25 a day.</p> <p>Nevertheless, officials point to progress on gender equality \u2013 notably the passing of a national plan of action on gender-based violence, and mandatory school education on the subject \u2013 as proof Timor-Leste is tackling the problem. \"We expect in the future that our president may be female,\" says the country's human rights and justice ombudsman, Sebastiao dias Ximenes. \"But we are just now trying to develop our human rights. We have to change our mentality [towards gender equality] because the previous mentality was influenced by either colonial thought or economics.\"</p> <p>Many marriages are still arranged around traditional dowries, but the fact that one-third of all parliamentary seats are reserved for women has helped Timor-Leste understand that \"women are an integrated and important part of society\", says prime minister Xanana Gusmao. \"It forces us politicians and society [to question] male chauvinism in our culture.\"</p> <p>Activists worry, however, about funding for many of the programmes addressing gender-based crime. Donor funding for both VSS and Pradet, a charity offering psychosexual recovery and forensic testing for those affected, is due to expire at the end of this year, with unknown consequences.</p> <p>\"If the donors were to put their hands up empty, our services would be finished,\" says Pradet's Manuel dos Santos. \"Even the police depend on us for forensic testing or placing the victim in a safe house.\"</p>",

Since the law passed there was an obligation to tell people if you use cookies , but from 26 May 2011 the new cookies law required anyone using them to inform web users upfront.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ico.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)</a>, responsible for enforcing data protection rules in the UK, set a year long compliance deadline which has just expired. Predictably, many left it to the last minute, giving rise to that late May frenzy.</p> <p>If you put any cookies onto people's devices, there are two key elements to compliance: you must provide clear and comprehensive information about the purposes of the storage of, or access to, the information that will be stored by the cookie and the user must have given you his or her consent. Consent is not defined in the regulations and the ICO have stressed that different organisations will come up with different solutions. Consent is not required for strictly necessary cookies; for the other cookies the method of obtaining consent is decided according to how intrusive the cookie is.</p> <p>As a first step, you should conduct a cookie audit and identify the cookies that you've got. They will be a mix of yours and third parties (eg, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/analytics/\" title=\"\">Google Analytics</a>).

Then decide on how to deal with consent.</p> <p>Pop-up windows to get consent are a safe bet for compliance, but evidence suggests website use drops dramatically (including at the ICO!). Getting consent through terms and conditions and privacy policy also works, but only if people are agree to them. A more subtle approach is specific notices placed on the website indicating that cookies are used \u2013 which is what most have decided to do. This is the least offensive option to people visiting your website \u2013 and gives a better chance of that person having a positive interaction and thus staying and donating.</p> <p>The ICO recently indicated that implied consent will be valid as long as the organisation is satisfied that people will understand that their actions will result in cookies being set, although some situations, such as the collection of personal health information, may lead website owners to feel that explicit consent is required. Charities encourage online donations, and rely heavily on well-designed websites to raise their profiles and collect donations. Charities need to assess how effective their online campaigns have been. The inability to place cookies without obtaining consent will affect their ability to do this.</p> <p>Formal undertakings and enforcement notices are the ICO's preferred method of enforcement and monetary penalties will only be issued in the most serious cases of non-compliance where people have suffered damage. The ICO is not (generally) heavy handed and seeks to obtain compliance by consent. The approach should essentially be this: look at what you are doing, have a plan, be transparent about that and don't get sidetracked by what others are doing \u2013 every site is unique!</p> <p><em>Vanessa Barnett is a Partner at Charles Russell LLP</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>Barcelona defeated Real Madrid 3-2 at Camp Nou and the best thing that happened to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho's team was the score. Andr\u00e9s Iniesta had just delivered another wonderful pass when Angel Di Mar\u00eda scored the goal that changes this final entirely.</p> <p>The roar at the final whistle disguised Catalan frustration. The Spanish Super Cup should have been virtually theirs. It is not. Two away goals change everything: a 1-0 win in the second leg in six days' time would be enough for Real. The game was 85 minutes old when Iniesta slotted a cleverly angled ball to Lionel Messi well inside the penalty area. One on one with Iker Casillas, Messi was unable to take the chance. Gerard Piqu\u00e9, following up, could not either. Had he scored, it would have been Barcelona 4-1 Real Madrid.</p> <p>Few would have questioned its validity, either. But in the blink of an eye, it was 3-2. Victor Vald\u00e9s collected a simple back bass and saw Di Mar\u00eda running at him. He tried to dribble past the Argentinian. Instead, he lost control, lost his balance and lost the ball. Barcelona lost a huge advantage. They had dominated, even if it did take a Cristiano Ronaldo header to finally bring goals to a fascinating game and to give Barcelona the incisiveness that their precision had previously lacked.</p> <p>For so much of this match, the ball zipped around the pitch at great speed, from Barcelona player to Barcelona player and back again. Iniesta was in the heart of the midfield and at times his footwork was barely believable, a master puppeteer. Messi too produced some sublime touches, dropping deep into the midfield, pausing, waiting, accelerating. To start with chances were few, though. When Piqu\u00e9 struck wide after 16 minutes it was the first shot but the pressure was building, the momentum set.</p> <p>Real's sudden bursts forward were few. Alves then pulled back for Messi to strike wide. Ten minutes later, a familiar movement with an unfamiliar finish. Messi dashed right to left diagonally into the area, evading defenders. This time his shot flashed past the post. Pedro's shot was pushed over. And just before half time, Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez was brought down by Ra\u00fal Albiol as he turned into the area.</p> <p>Barcelona had dominated yet Real took the lead. Ozil's corner swung outwards from the right and Ronaldo beat Sergio Busquets and Alexis S\u00e1nchez to the ball to head in powerfully. It was the fourth Camp Nou <em>cl\u00e1sico</em> in a row in which he had scored. Real were one up. It was their first attempt on goal. But as suddenly as they had the lead they lost it.</p> <p>All game Pedro had been on the left. Now he switched to the right. Javier Mascherano's pass, curling his way over 30 yards, was perfect; the touch, impeccable. Pedro controlled it in one and struck it hard past Casillas. Barcelona poured forward. As they did so Madrid threatened on the break. The game was alive. Messi and Alves combined, Ronaldo had a shot blocked, Messi switched passes with Iniesta, Alonso's 60 yard ball almost put Ozil in, only for his control to prove heavy. Just before Ozil's opportunity, Barcelona had gone 2-1 up. Iniesta wasat the heart of Barcelona's best moments and he was brought down by Sergio Ramos for the penalty from which Messi scored his 14th goal against Barcelona's greatest rivals.</p> <p>With just under quarter of an hour to go, Iniesta had it again. Albiol and Khedira were passed, Ramos slid. None could stop him. Iniesta slid the ball into the path of Xavi. Faced by his old friend Iker Casillas, he calmly slotted the ball home. There was still time for Iniesta to deliver another wonderful assist. This time, though, Casillas did save. And at the other end, Vald\u00e9s did not.</p>"
